Yes, yes there was. It was called Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time, and it featured Bugs Bunny traveling through time, stomping and kicking on things, and collecting icons through different time periods. This game is also about time travel. It is also, to a lesser extent, about hopping on people's heads and kicking them in the buttocks. It is also by Infogrames. But this is not that game -- no, this is a game about two people, caught in a world of mystery. Trapped in a web of deceit. Paper cut by a world full of hate. This is the world of Bugs Bunny... and Taz, who work together to make history right for the good of talking animals and morbidly short humans everywhere.  Time Busters isn't exactly a sequel, but it will certainly feel familiar to anyone who played the first Bugs platformer. While both games stand firmly in the world of hopping and collecting, Lost in Time was as straightforward as it gets. Some fun concepts, but overall, a standard action title. In Time Busters, however, Artificial Mind + Movement has decided to take from a variety of sources to create a platform romp that will feel instantly familiar to any connoisseur. Everything from Crash to Croc 2 to Zelda to Mario 64 is referenced blatantly in the game in an attempt to give it a broad variety of styles to keep you interested.  The key to the game's success is in the dual control scheme. Instead of taking on time with one character, you actually control both Bugs Bunny and Taz as they try to collect a series of cogs throughout time, while defeating bosses, winning mini-games, and generally trying to catch the greedy, dopey and generally punk-ass Daffy as he once again screws up life for the innocent. He started the whole time mix-up, and it's up to you to collect cogs to stabilize Granny's time regulator (she's a busy gal in her retirement) and get the time crystal back from Daffy's possession. You'll explore everything from the Aztec and Viking ages to Arabia and Translyvania in an attempt to make things right, each age filled with its own selection of mini-games, straight up level romps, and boss battles.  Ever since Crash, Spyro and Croc 2 started tossing the platform salad, every new platformer has veered farther away from the standard level romp and has broken up levels into a wider variety of smaller parts, rather than keep with one theme. In the course of an area you'll find yourself sneaking around a maze of soldiers Zelda style, racing away from moving lava like Crash, playing a simplistic game of basketball like Banjo Tooie, pushing blocks around like... every 3D platformer ever made, and playing Parappa style repetition games. While there's a lot of variety in the parts, overall it's very familiar territory, and will give you more dj vu flashes the more platform games you've played. Time Busters has its share of innovations however, though it's mostly around the unique control scheme that acts as the game's foundation.  Time Busters focuses on the fact that you have to switch characters while you're playing in order to do specific tasks. Bugs can jump higher, can dive into rabbit holes, and use his ears like a helicopter to lengthen leaps, but Taz can lift objects, break apart large obstructions, or dig the holes in special areas that Bugs can then use. As you progress through the game you'll also gain dual abilities that you'll have to use to progress through the game, such as being able to jump on Taz' head to reach higher platforms, and the ability to lift Bugs and throw him to get to out-of-reach areas. Most of the time the puzzles that involve the characters are beyond simplistic -- Taz spins on a special area to make an object rotate, while Bugs picks up a rock and throws something into the now-accessible object, and so on. There are some great moments however, such as a great boss battle that involves you using both Bugs and Taz together to defeat Yosemite Sam, using nearly every one of their unique abilities. You'll have to kick Sam with Bugs, pick up his torch, jump on Taz' head to get on top of a stone that Taz has pushed, then light one of three ropes, all while avoiding Sam. If the entire game used that sort of teamwork, it would have made Time Busters stand out more than it does -- unfortunately, that sort of interaction is rare, and most of the time the game goes for the easy shot rather than the big challenge.  I guess it's hard to criticize a game for being too simplistic when it's based on something as childlike as Looney Tunes (we all love Tunes, but we'd be stupid if we didn't know the market this game is targeted to), but Time Busters will frustrate those of you looking for something to test your finger skills. Since the focus is less on platforming, and more on a variety of tasks, you'll be disappointed by the fact that maybe two out of every six or so sections of a level is actually fully dedicated to fighting creatures and exploring areas. You'll copy an ice skater, you'll play drums with an Aztec, you'll ride a dragon, but you'll rarely find yourself doing any challenging tasks, or getting out of dicey situations. Puzzles tend to be incredibly simplistic, and clues are abundant, and obvious. Boss battles are fun, but I'll be shocked if you can't get past them on the first try. Overall, Time Busters has a certain entertaining but monochromatic feel that will keep you playing, but rarely bring your heart rate above Saturday afternoon television levels.  And the graphics? This is truly a great looking PlayStation game. This is a great looking PlayStation game. Play this once or twice in 1024x768 resolution, though, and you'll see just how great a PlayStation game it really is. Textures are bright, and the objects and characters are fun to watch, but the detail is pretty negligible, particularly in cutscenes when you get close-up views of your favorite heroes, who are particular polygonally starved. The animations capture the characters perfectly though, everything from the way Bugs dives into a rabbit hole to Taz' big screaming scary face. Everything is handled with smooth motion, and lots of charm. Also to be noted is the expanded use of cutscenes, making the game feel a lot more like an ongoing cartoon than just a series of levels with a few little animation thrown in between them like bookmarks.  In terms of ear candy, it's a pretty solid affair. The music is simple but keeps firmly within Looney Tunes boundaries, meaning that it's mainly entertaining, but sometimes grinding. The voice acting, however, is exactly as you'd expect -- when you pay for a license, you also get the advantage of getting some of the best voice actors out there to speak as your favorite cartoon characters. Taz and Bugs are perfect, Grammy is perfect... everyone's perfect. The jokes may not be up there with classic WB, but at least you can hear Daffy tell bad jokes, instead of some graphics intern working at the development company over the summer.  One last note regarding the controls -- if you don't have a gamepad, I wouldn't really recommend this title. Though it's pretty obvious that you'd want one to play a platform game, there's the added problem that the direction controls on the keyboard like to clog up on a regular basis, causing your hero to run in a certain direction until... you hit a whole bunch of keys, or swear, or pray or whatever it is you like to do. Basically you'll find yourself with a poltergeist-controlled character every 20 minutes or so if you use a keyboard, so I'd highly recommend you use a gamepad.  What harms B&B is also what keeps it from being a flop -- the large scoops taken from so many other platformers ensures that you'll have some fun but predictable experiences. But unfortunately, other than the double-character control scheme, it keeps it from ever stepping out into truly original territory. There's a lot of charm here... just not enough momentum to keep anyone but younger gamers interested.  -- Vincent Lopez Want to share your opinions with the world?

Even though the first Bugs Bunny game received favorable reviews from most of the gaming press, I was surprised to find out that I enjoyed playing Bugs Bunny & Taz Time Busters as much as I did. The developers made excellent use of the license and did a splendid job in incorporating the two different characters in the game. Time Busters is a very enjoyable platform game and is definitely something that Looney Tunes fans should pick up.", "date": "Mar 2, 2001"}
