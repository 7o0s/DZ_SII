The two editions of the game share the same setting and general game play mechanics, but the difference in pacing and presentation found in the 2D version demands that we give them separate reviews.   Carbon casts you as a young street racer named Jason, new in town and looking to scare up some cash on the underground circuit. As you pocket winnings, you meet characters on the circuit that love you or loath you. Some will choose to help your career, serving as blockers that interfere with the other racers. Between races, you must spend a good portion of your hard-won cash to upgrade your car. Without upgrading your wheels, you won't be able to handle the harder races later in your twelve-stage career.   Your career consists of a dozen races. After competing in three urban events on tracks with names like Staccato Avenue and Hoodlum High, you're challenged to a one-on-one race in the canyons outside the city center. Beating the boss of places like Red Canyon and Hollow Hill Canyon results in a truckload of cash and the necessary respect to move on to the next array of chumps.   When you begin your career, you can choose between a Porsche 911 GT3 RS, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX MR, and Ford Mustang. As you race, you buy upgrades for engines, tires, and the body. But each stock vehicle has a slight edge in one category. For example, the Mustang rolls out of the garage with better tires. After selecting your car, you get to engage the first race and start making money.   To earn money, you must do more than just come in first. You must corner with style. Drifting is the currency of choice in Carbon. When approaching a corner, tap the OK (or 5) key to start the drift and then steer into the corner. The rear of the car automatically swings wide and you begin the drift. Since you automatically accelerate in carbon, you just need to straighten out to end the drift and pocket the cash. If you hit another car (rival or incoming traffic) or slam into the rail, you lose all of your drift points. Just pulling off individual drifts will put good money in your pocket, but to really bank enough cash and max out your ride, you need to link up drifts in S-curves. Tap the OK key to start the draft and then slide through the corners, pressing OK each time you start drifting around the next corner to keep the meter running. With practice, you can earn $1,500 or more on sequences of turns.   You earn power-ups as you dive deeper into the game, including nitro boosts, blockers, and fixers. You earn power-ups by advancing through the racing field. Nitros make your car lurch ahead. Blockers are used during races with larger fields and cut off your rival drivers, making it easier to get ahead of them. Fixers adjust traffic lights so you can enjoy a brief respite from oncoming cars.   After you win three races, you move on to a boss battle in one of Carbon's canyons. Theses are not straight races for a finish line. Instead, you must put enough distance between your car and the rival to be declared the winner. The canyon races unfold on narrow, winding roads that require more precision than you need to win city races. Not surprisingly, these are the best events in the game, as the increasingly brutal boss racers really turn the screws with their expert wheel skills. I really wanted more of these races -- this wouldn't be a bad thing for EA Mobile explore in a mobile-only sequel.   One of my disappointments with Carbon: The urban tracks pretty much blend together. The backdrops never change beyond similar-looking skyscrapers. There is no real unique feature to any urban race, and so by the time you've reached the ninth street race, it feels more like a continuing of the first race. It would have been cool to see something -- new buildings for different districts (industrial, high-rise, market) or different time of night (twilight versus dawn?) -- to indicate advancement beyond the increase in your pocketbook.   Also, I recognize that I've been playing mobile games for well over four years now, but I found Carbon just too easy. It took me a little over an hour or so to burn through all twelve race events. I only lost one race in my entire first career -- and it was a canyon battle. (You can start a new career after beating the game, either opting to use your tricked-out car or a brand-new vehicle.) In the city races, the oncoming cars are a tougher challenge than your rivals. Once I put a rival in the rearview mirror, he or she stayed there. It's when trying to string together huge drift sequences that I would find trouble with the non-descript black cars that serve as traffic.   I played Carbon on a Sony Ericsson w810i. The developer Rovio did a solid job with presentation; the game graphics are not as good as I've seen elsewhere, but the whole thing is very clean with an emphasis on functionality. Your car looks good, but the other cars are very bland. The bridges and tunnels you pass are blocky. But the trade-off, I assume, is for the fast frame rate. There are no hiccups or chugging frames in this version of Carbon, and that's really good to see in a racing game. The game is accompanied by decent music. Not great music, but decent.  If you aren't rolling with a 3D-enabled handset, the 2D-edition of Need for Speed Carbon isn't a bad place to test out your mobile leadfoot. If you like top-down racers, I'd recommend you download I-play's Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift. But if you want a behind-the-car racer, your choice is between Carbon and Gameloft's Asphalt 3: Street Rules. The edge goes to Asphalt for better presentation and greater difficulty. But if you are a huge NFS fan -- maybe you bought the wireless racing wheel to play the Xbox 360 edition of Carbon? -- mobile Carbon will give you a little fix when you're out and about.", "date": "Feb 5, 2007"}
