Ff you're dying to get a semblance of feeling of that, then IHRA Drag Racing - Sportsman Edition is all you need... assuming that all you need is a game where the only skill required is to have lightning quick reflexes. Oh wait, did I say this is a game? No, not at all, this is one long and tedious simulation of several thousand trips down a lonely strip of asphalt where your faith in anything exciting gets crushed into a fine powder and tossed into the wind.   The core of the racing here is the race itself, and oh what a lack of anything resembling barely more than nothing that is. You roll your car up through a slick part of asphalt and burnout the tires by jamming on the gas until the tires are hot. Sometimes this is short, sometimes it's long, but you always know they'll get hot. They just do. After that, to top it off, you slowly drive back past the starting line in reverse. Don't worry, more will happen... kinda.    After rolling to the starting line and you are ready to race. The lights count down, your pulse begins to quicken to a pace beyond pure lethargy, and then you hit the gas! And you go! Down to the end! And if you did it all just right you'll get to the end before the other guy. There's a bit of nudging the car left and right to keep it going straight, which is the other half of the skill in a way, but since there are no turns, the racing line is a straight line. It's totally sweet.   Since this racing action isn't enough on its own to even be called a mini-game, there's some strategy involved as well. Each driver dials in a time that is their best guess as to how long it'll take them to race down the track. The game takes the difference of the two drivers' times and gives a handicap to the slower car -- and if either one goes faster than this time, then it commits a ~breakout~ and is disqualified. So whoever gets the closest time to his estimate wins. That means that the skills that win the first race will win the last. So that also means that there's little-to-no point to playing any more than the few dozen races before you realize that nothing ever happens in this Twilight Zone. You're stuck going all out forever, trying to time your feeble button pushes to the slave-driving light tree.   Sure there may be events that happen in different tracks with different cars that are also going straight, but you're still going straight down a short track. To make the pain last longer it's forbidden to sell a car or parts along the way to get a faster upgrade; so players are forced to enter even more races to earn enough money to get a slightly faster car that earns them the right to drive straight against another car. It's a hideous torture and the sporadic bugs and crashes (as in system crashes, not crashed) during the game surely must be evidence that there is a higher power of some cultural heritage that is telling us not to play this.This is the fifth installment of the IHRA racing games and they're still all about the same boring routine of playing out simple races. It's obvious that the audience for these games is purely made up of hardcore fans and absolutely nobody else. Unfortunately, this won't convince anybody that this sport should be taken seriously. Instead, this will be held up as an example by members of Congress as to how games are rotting your brain and a players' high score here should be solid grounds for a permanent installation in a mental facility. It's sloppy, boring, and lacks any depth whatsoever.", "date": "Jul 27, 2006"}
