And they have to do the little hamster thing to get it rolling? Well that's not what this game is about at all. Turns out a rollcage is special structural device to reinforce a car's chassy. I should have remembered that from when I built a model of the General Lee back in third grade. Anyway, this is yet another racing game in the Psygnosis catalog. Basically, it's not too different from other racing sims, but there are a few notable distinctions.  The basic premise of this game is that the cars are totally indestructible. No matter what you do to them, they just keep going. Weapons and other power ups are used only to disorient or slow down your opponents. In fact, your car itself becomes a weapon of sorts. You can use it to drive into buildings and trees and other objects lining the tracks. If you hit the buildings just right, you can send them crashing down on whoever is following you.  Psygnosis has hyped this game as ~360-degrees, no rules racing.~ I have to disagree. They make it sound like you can go wherever you want. That's simply not the case. You are not allowed to travel off of the track whatsoever. While you have an infinite turning radius, this becomes more of a liability than anything else as you'll often wind up facing the wrong direction entirely.  While they say that they have built the most realistic physics model for any racing game yet, I'm not to sure whether or not they actually consulted any physicists at all. When a three-ton car travelling at 250mph hits a multi-megaton building, it's going to stop. I don't care how indestructible the car is.  I will say that the car moves right. I've never driven anything over 250mph before, but it seemed right at least. At that speed handling has to become second nature or you'll be crashing left and right. You spend a lot of time flipping around and spinning in the air, anyway. Fortunately, the cars are designed to run no matter which side is up. When you flip, just wait until the rubber meets the road and you're off again. You just better hope you're facing the right direction.  There are six separate cars to choose from and each is driven by a citizen of a different country. More importantly for you, each car is rated in one of four separate categories-acceleration, top speed, grip and strength. It's up to you to pick the car you think would be best for you r style of racing. For me, I tried all six. While none of them seemed to be obviously handicapped in some major area, there simply wasn't an all around average car. But there are a number of secret vehicles hidden within the game itself.  The cars travel at obscene speeds. The fastest reach upwards of 500kph (over 300mph for you American readers). With speeds that high you can rely on the natural effect of g-forces to glue your car to the track. This means that you can race on walls, ceilings and any other flat surface you can get four wheels on. The game camera still needs a little tweaking to pull this off effectively, though. When you race up onto the ceiling, the game camera doesn't rotate with you for a few seconds. I found this disorienting to say the least. It makes it difficult to make the transition to steering upside down to steering right side up.  The controls are fairly simple. That is to say that they are laid out simply. Using them to control the car is another matter entirely. Using the keyboard, the arrow keys control steering and acceleration. You have separate keys to change the views but I wouldn't suggest using them; this thing's hard enough to keep on the track as it is. It certainly wouldn't help to be facing backwards while cruising at a brisk 300mph down a track covered in flaming debris. There are also separate controls for braking and firing weapons.  There are eight separate power ups in the game. You acquire these by driving over them. You can store two power ups at any given time. There are separate firing controls for each so you can pick which of the two you'd like to use first. Most are fairly standard to those who have played these racing games before. You have speed-ups, shields and a variety of missiles. In addition to these rather mundane bonuses, you can also get wormholes, time warps and ice sheets.  The wormhole targets the racer in first place and teleports him just behind your car. This is very useful if you're in second place, but you better make sure that the lead guy doesn't have a weapon. The time warp merely slows all the other racers on the track, allowing you to catch up. The ice sheet is best used in confined areas like tunnels. It lays down a slick sheet of ice that profoundly affects a car's handling.  There are 20 total tracks in Rollcage, spread across four distinct planetary environments. Ten tracks are for league play. There is also a practice track and two hidden, bonus tracks. These 13 are strictly single player tracks. For multi-player fun you can choose from three basic tracks or four special deathmatch tracks. Each planet is supposed to have its own unique weather and gravity. These two factors affect the way your car handles on the track but I found the differences to be slight.  There are numerous buildings and trees and lightposts and all kinds of other objects on the side of the tracks. You can use your car to crash into these objects and send them crashing down onto the track. This is an excellent way to impede the progress of those racers unfortunate enough to be behind you. In addition to rubble and power ups, you may also find speed lanes on the tracks. These special areas provide an enormous speed boost when you pass over them. Just make sure that you can handle the speed. Frequently these lanes are put just in front of tight turns or huge jumps. If you're not careful, you'll end up costing yourself valuable time.  The tracks look really sweet. The road and sky detail help to put you in the game. All the weapon effects and explosions were brilliant. There's plenty of smoke and fire here, too. You get realistic skid marks when you slide and lens flares when looking into the sun. Notable among the power up effects are the wormhole, which sends a glowing ring of energy shooting down the track, and the timewarp, which causes the whole screen to glow and shift. The cars themselves are the least detailed objects in the whole game. Even so, they look good from all angles-and if you drive anything like me, you'll get a chance to see all the angles.  So the game looks great and it's a lot of fun for a few hours, but that's about it. Sure, there were some secrets I didn't discover, but I really didn't care. I was ready to put this one down after only a handful of races.  All in all it really is a beautiful game and it runs very well. Psygnosis has promised at least 30fps even on the split screen versions with the details turned up. On a 333MHz machine with a Voodoo2 I got very smooth action. Frankly, I can see some advantages to running  the game a little slower. I might not even need the rollcage at that point. It's probably worth taking it slow just so you can take in the beautiful details all over the track.  Well, I have to wrap it up now. I have a design meeting with the American Gladiator people.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Apr 13, 1999"}
