{"name": "Revenge of Arcade", "name_review": "Revenge of Arcade", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/08/01/revenge-of-arcade", "text": "This is a collection of twenty-five year old arcade games being re-released for the PC by Microsoft, containing Xevious, Mappy, Motos, Rally-X and Ms. Pac Man. While these names will certainly bring back a lot of memories for long-time gamers, reviewing such a pack isn't particularly easy. The games are a mixed bag, and everybody has their own favorites from days spent in the arcade.  Xevious is a classic shooter in the vein of Zaxxon or River Raid. You control one small ship that can freely move up and down, left or right, and fires two different types of guns--one for aerial opponents, one for ground targets. The gameplay is simple, and while the graphics don't look quite as good as I remember them from the arcade, the fun factor is definitely still there, even after all these years.  Mappy is an example from another prolific genre--that of the cartoon character who must around grabbing goodies before the bad guys close in; somewhat in the mold of Donkey Kong or Dig-Dug. Here you control a cartoon mouse who can move vertically through the levels easily, but can only rise horizontally by jumping on trampolines that get progressively weaker as time goes on. The game has a lot depth considering the brevity of the design, but I found the keyboard controls a little too unresponsive.  What can you say about Ms. Pac Man? If you liked it back then, you'll still like it now. I have to admit I was cured of Pac Man fever a long time ago. I wasn't too impressed with Rally-X either, a timed maze chase only vaguely related to racing games.   But the lesser known Motos was a pleasant surprise, and stands as my personal favorite in this pack. Like Joust, Tron or any number of other older, simpler games, it holds up quite well and is a perfect time killer for five to ten minutes in-between word processing or other less-than-exciting tasks. It's also the kind of unique design we rarely see anymore.  At any rate, whether or not this collection is worth your twenty bucks depends, of course, on whether or you feel an overwhelming nostalgia for any of the titles in the pack. Even that's a debatable proposition, considering the amount of emulators out there on the web. In theend, nostalgia really only goes so far--the odds are pretty good that you'll buy the pack, play some of the games once or twice, and then forget all about it.  -- Jason Bates", "date": "Aug 1, 1998"}
