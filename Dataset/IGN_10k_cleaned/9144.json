Now ST head honcho Peanut Butter Wolf puts his skills to the test and goes for a fast break of beats and attitude with the mix-tape accompaniment to 2K Sports latest entry in their popular basketball videogame series.   Crammed to the gills with indie legends like Percee P, Quasimoto, MF Doom, and Madlib, as well as icons in the game such as Q-Tip, Talib Kweli, and J Dilla, the album pretty much serves up a warm platter of juicy grooves and head nodding rhymes, all tied together with quick fix snippets and intermediary sound bites that meld into each track like jell-o. ~See (Suite)~ from Supreme Team kicks things off, first with some bugged out spoken word snatches that eventually bleed into low-n-slow beats and languidly dark rhyme schemes.      For the next track M.E.D. doesn't even pause to mess around, going straight for the jugular over a turgidly rapturous beat that is all wrapped around thunder rolls of drums, fuzz guitar, and soul lament vocal samples. Guilty Simpson represents Detroit over a start and stutter soul grind augmented by horns, sirens, and echo shift filtering that reverberates from channel to channel (headphone this baby for sure). Talib Kweli and Q-Tip deliver one of the album's more abstract numbers that exhibits some of Dilla's most bugged out production ever as it utilizes water bubbling over Pacman-styled blippages, and strange vintage pop samples. Kweli and Tip ride the erratic groove as only they can, turning it into a blast of bachelor pad excess.   Meanwhile Percee P and Madlib (with J Rocc) bring it back to an underground hardcore stance with ~Legendary Lyricist, Pt. 2.~ J Rocc spends his time on the track trying to let all the fools out there know that Percee is truly a legend (and those who have been following rap for at least the past two decades should know how Percee P is). J Rock then steps up for a solo venture on ~Super Sound,~ which is all crazy drums and weirded out samples that drift in and out of the mix. Ditto for Madlib's ~The Wigflip,~ which continues the trippy instrumental stylings.    MF Doom and Guilty Simpson co-habitate on a J Dilla beat that sounds like a long lost RZA joint (think ~C.R.E.A.M.~ but twisted up something fierce). Doom's dank encrusted growl even sounds like Method Man light and Guilty ends up sounding a lot like GZA. It's interesting, but the dj vu nature of the track ultimately hurts it, even if it might have been meant as a tribute/homage to the Wu. Oh No, who is usually a behind the scenes madman, ups the ante and delivers both beats and rhymes on the hard hitting ~Action (Rap Version).~ Delivering hardcore battle thrusts and parries, Oh No brings what may easily be the hardest, grimiest track on the album.   Beat Konducta (Madlib) brings another slice on instrumental trickery with ~Trouble,~ which bleeds seamlessly into ~Hydrant Game (Jaylib Remix)~ featuring Quasimoto. The high pitched one kicks the ballistics as only he can. By this time you either love Quas or you hate him, so the track will either resonate or not. Cool jazz vibes seem to burble through Aloe Blacc's ~Find A Way,~ which takes propulsive horns, scratchmatic ambiance, and a definite Brazilian slumber slide to create a lazily beautiful number that drips with sweet R&B pleasure. It's refreshing in a total head cracking sort of way (it's the one track that simultaneously feels right at home and totally out of place on the album).    Things begin to get downright bugged out with the electro shuffle of Dam-Funk's ~Sidewayz,~ which is all blip rhythms and '70s synth washes. The electro disturbance continues on Baron Zen's ~Electronic (Koushik Remix).~ James Pants turns the style into a threepeat, thanks to the house-styled keyboard surge on ~Ka$h (Peanut Butter Wolf Remix),~ which is then given a strange Prince-styled neo-funk/R&B saturation in terms of the vocal adornment. Just when you think you're gonna get stuck in parachute pant and big hair hell, the four year old prodigy Niko kicks up some genuine freshness, sounding like he was weaned on a healthy dose of vintage '80s Def Jam and Sleeping Bag artists (a little LL, a little EPMD, a little Slick Rick, and a whole lotta youthful ambition). Kid rappers are usually a dime a gimmick, but Niko actually pulls it off, delivering some nice verbiage for a four year old.   When Koushik clocks in for a second time it's with a serious Old School styled instrumental that mixes glaring guitar, snap dragon drums, and clanking background noize into a wonderfully raw chunk of instrumental gutter funk. Flashback '80s influenced Planet Rock vibes emanate from Arabian Prince's ~Professor X Saga,~ which probably would have been better served if placed elsewhere in the mix (along with the other electro numbers by Dam-Funk, Baron Zen, and James Pants, for example).    The Old School electro surge continues on ~Bass Creator's Groove,~ by Jonathon Brown. High pitched synth is balanced between thundering ping pong bass notes while Brown rambles about bass in a melodramatic baritone. The album's closer, ~Big Girl, Skinny Girl~ keeps the basement-styled electro magnetism on full tilt. Laced up by CX Kidtronik it's a definite homage to the Mantronik days of the early '80s. From a historical perspective it's interesting, to be sure, but this tinny, electronic style sounds just a tad out of date in 2007 and actually ends up straddling the line between being a loving tribute and an ironic piss take.   For the most part B-Ball Zombie War is a solid affair that works as a nice introduction to a wide variety of Stones Throw artists. On the other hand it often becomes a hectic and erratic collection that bounces from style to style without a care for listener stability. The album is undeniably top heavy with well-crafted indie rap bliss and then bottom heavy with electro flashback wig outs. In terms of capturing the energy and urgency of basketball, the first part of the album is the way to go. The latter half is really meant for those looking to indulge in some strangeness and perhaps break up the monotony of the day.    In many ways this album would have worked better as a double disc broken up into rap and electro sections. Either that or PBW should have opted for the tried and true mixing style of placing one rap track next to one electro track next to one instrumental, then repeating that six more times until the cycle was finished. As it stands in it's current format the album feels like he's luring the fans of Percee P, J Dill, and Madlib in at the onset and then sucker punching them with a bugged out electro history lesson at the end. I appreciate the homage to the Old School, but I'd prefer to have it mixed together a little better or separated altogether.
