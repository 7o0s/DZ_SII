There has been a pretty thick line between the two styles of racer that very few games have managed to cross successfully in the last few years. So it is with a big smile that I can tell you that EA Sports has managed to come up with a winner that will appeal to both the hardcore simmers and the arcade fans out there. This year's Superbike incarnation provides so many options and tweaks that anyone should be able to play happily.  But before we get into the tweaks and tricks that all of you will be happy to hear about, let's get into something that everyone can agree on. This game is damn pretty. Damn pretty. The bike models in the game are no less than fantastic. The rider models are also no less than fantastic. And the tracks are beautifully rendered with bitmapped terrain and crowds less noticeable than it usually is in racing games. I can't even tell you how many folks walked by my desk saying, ~Wow... what's that you're playing? It's tiiiiight....~   EA spent some time nailing down all of the details so that you could really have the best experience possible. From the terrific animation of the crashes (I'll get deeper in to this little bit of wonderful in a second), to the simple little skidmarks that stay on the track, to the trophy ceremonies for winning a race, they are all top notch.   Rider models are fantastic. They didn't skimp and cover the rider's faces with a shaded visor or anything like that either, you can actually see the riders' faces inside their helmets. They'll also be kind enough to make rude gestures at you if you're sloppy and cause them to swerve. This option is open to you as well, although that move is usually saved for multiplayer games as the computer really doesn't give much reaction if you flip it off.  The bike models are so detailed that you would swear they are real half of the time. To find anything wrong there, you would have to be extremely nit-picky. Hell even the tires collect grass and dirt rings around them when you are unfortunate enough to wander off of the asphalt. You wouldn't really think that it would be so noticeable, but when you see the tires and spokes spinning on the bikes, it'll make you smile.  One of my favorite parts of the game (yes it's a small one) was the animations that happened when you would hit a bump or take a turn wrong. Watching the riders try to keep their balance by sticking a leg out or sitting up in their seats was a real treat. Even better were the animations when you really screwed up and the riders left their seats for a second, hanging on only by the handlebars. It really just put a crink of pain in your face anticipating the crash that is almost assuredly going to happen. Beautiful. Don't worry though, those of you that don't have a great computer will find plenty of different options to turn down the quality of the graphics if you need to.  So now that the sugary coating is out of the way, let's delve into the gameplay a bit. I have to admit, I'm not really sure how to start here. There are so many options that change the gameplay so much, it's all a blur in my mind. I guess we'll start with the four main settings, Rookie, Amateur, Pro, and Real. These big options change several other little ones that will change the gameplay. Rookie is a fairly easy and arcadey, ~you can't really fall over unless you want to,~ style of game and Real is a butt hard, ~oh my God, why can't I stay on my bike?~ sim type of game. So you can take one end or the other, split the difference, or mix and match options yourself if you find it's more difficult for you with some things on or off.  Options to choose from include computer assistance for the brakes, acceleration, and steering so the game will slow you down a bit when you approach a turn, keep your speed at a good level, and correct any over or under steering, brake effectiveness, auto rider movement, and of course transmission style. There are also a slew of realism settings that can be switched on and off including manual bike setup, tire management, full crash (on will make you watch your guy pick up your bike and start again where off will just have you pop back up), engine failure, and bike damage. All of these options combine for an extremely wide range of game style and should satisfy even the pickiest of consumers. You'll just have to test everything out to see what it is that you like the best.  Once you've chosen your difficulty (I would recommend starting out a lower level, even if you are a hardcore sim junky) and turned all of your options on and off, you'll need to pick a rider and bike to play with. All of the Superbike teams are in on the action including the likes of Suzuki, Ducati, Honda, etc. After you've picked the team you want to ride for, you can pick a rider from that team. If you don't like his name, you can change it. There's plenty of info on both the bikes and the riders that you can peruse in order to pick the combo perfect for you. I tried several different riders and bikes and could feel a bit of difference in the way some of the bikes handled, but the rider didn't seem to make any difference.  After you've selected your bike and rider, you will need to pick what kind of game to play. Options are pretty familiar here with the first being the obligatory Quick Start that will catapult you into a race at the back of the pack. The second is Single Round that will let you race the practice laps, qualifying rounds, and finally the race. For both of these you'll need to pick from the 13 different Superbike tracks available to you. The third option is training, where you should start your adventure in racing. You pick a track and race by yourself and at any time, you can open up the pause menu where you will see a map of the track. You can click on different parts of the track and voiceover tips will play to help you conquer that section. The last single player game is Championship where you can race through all 13 tracks. Points are doled out for what place is taken and whomever has the most points at the end of the season is crowned supreme champion of the universe and ruler of all that is.   One quick note on controllers. I must say that it is almost imperative that you have some kind of analog control to make precise movements. I used a gamepad and the keyboard and it really makes the game near impossible to play well. My controller of choice was a joystick and I recommend that if you have the resources to get one.  Once you get into the race, the real fun starts. The physics model in the game is near perfect. Of course the effects of the model change with the difficulty setting. The low levels are really just a fun romp around the track without much chance of falling due to the computer help you'll receive, but when you step it up to real, you might as well go out and get on an actual racing motorcycle. It is damn hard. If you go off the road, you'll be in a world of trouble. If you over or under steer, you'll be in a world of trouble. If you look at your bike wrong, you'll be in a world of trouble. EA really did a great job capturing the skill it takes to be a world-class rider. You won't be prefect at this game right off the bat. You probably won't even be good at the real mode for quite some time. But at least you won't suffer the road rash and injuries it takes to actually become good at the real sport.  Seeing some of the nasty crashes that can happen in the game really make me thankful for padding that a computer screen supplies. The crash models in this game are some of the most entertaining and painful to watch that I have ever seen. Bikes go sliding, flipping, spinning, and twirling and the riders go sliding and flying through the air so realistically, you'd swear you were watching a real accident. The only thing the crashes are missing are ambulances and fire trucks to go speeding onto the course to pick the poor sap and his bike up.  So should you buy this game? If you love racing games, the answer is a definite yes. It's a top-notch racer that should be on your wish list this year. It leans toward the sim side of things, but does a great job crossing that line separating most arcadey and simmy racing titles. If you can spend the time to master this title, you will have one of the most fun and realistic racing experiences that you can find on a computer.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
