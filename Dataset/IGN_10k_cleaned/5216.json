It's not really a game design that other developers have pounced on and ~borrowed~ for their own projects,  but that's exactly what THQ has done with Nicktoons: Freeze Frame Frenzy. But it doesn't seem like the GBA tailors itself well to this idea, or at least when it's reduced to a simple side-scrolling 2D world. This ~game~ is obviously tailored for kids who are easily tickled by silly little animations, but there's not a whole lot of challenge in this design. It's more just a bunch of busywork that'll keep the young ones occupied in the back seat for a couple of hours. Nicktoons: Freeze Frame Frenzy one of the most cluttered trademark screens ever seen on a Game Boy Advance title. There's a reason for this: THQ throws nearly every character in the current Nicktoon lineup in this one single game, and if Nickelodeon had a kitchen sink character you'd find him here, too. Something or someone somewhere has caused a rip in the Nickelodeon space-time continuum, and characters from different Nicktoons worlds have bled into other unrelated cartoons. Jimmy Neutron's the brains of the game who's recruited your help to fix the problems that have occurred in each of the worlds. Basically, players simply walk along a forced-scrolling environment targeting specific items with a crosshair to snap a picture. The idea is to locate items of interest and take its picture. At the beginning of the level Jimmy Neutron gives a list of items to look for -- move onto the next level by completing the required score or criteria quota for each level.  This  idea works in a 3D world because the player must keep track of their environments all over the place...in Pokemon Snap, things happen above, below, in front of, and behind the player, so it takes a lot of skill and memorization, and takes several times through an area to get everything required to move on. But in this sidescrolling environment, there is no skill. It's a simple matter of moving the cursor like a console version of Operation Wolf without the lightgun. Just hammer down on the ~take picture~ button over everything that looks like something. In most cases, everything has a point value, and in most cases a quick trigger finger is all that's really required to beat a level. Granted, there is a little bit of a challenge in boss battles, and players also need to ~shoot~ items that might get a little too close to the on-screen character. It's almost like a non-violent version of Cabal or Nam 1975.  Altron, the game's developer, throw in some goofy animations for several of the idle objects, so most of the ~fun~ of the game boils down to ~Haha! Look at the funny thing that happens when I take a picture of the tree!~ But it really isn't all that funny. Maybe I'm just old and surly. Or maybe it's hard to have ~funny~ things happen in two-frame animations. But the game's made for the young couch potatoes that know everything about all of Nicktoons, including minor characters that may have only been used once or twice an episode. Is Nicktoons: Freeze Frame Frenzy a bad game? No. It, at the very least, gives the younger crowd access to a unique game with a different style of gameplay, at least in GBA standards, and offers a huge variety of playable and non-playable characters across several different franchises. It's like a kart racer without the karts or the racing. But don't expect anything stunning or special about this game. It's over in a couple of hours, and if you know how many minutes are in a couple of hours, you're too old for Nicktoons: Freeze Frame Frenzy.", "date": "Nov 4, 2004"}
