{"name": "Glover", "name_review": "Glover PlayStation Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/01/04/glover-playstation-review", "text": "Ever since Super Mario 64, the cutesy 3D platformer genre has exploded, and just about every company has made at least some effort to milk it for all it's worth. Unfortunately, many of these games are poorly made, and often seem more like an afterthought than an actual game.   There are always those few diamonds in the rough, but, unfortunately, Glover isn't one of them. Atari tried its hand at the genre (yuck yuck), and, while some of its ideas are right-on, the final collaboration of semi-clever game elements just doesn't come out all that great. Seal the deal with dreadfully lackluster visuals, (worse than those seen on the original Nintendo 64 incarnation of Glover), and you've got one truly unmemorable gameplay experience on your... Hand.  Gameplay As much as I'd love to feed my legacy of devastatingly witty puns by saying ~everything fits like a glove,~ as an honest, caring man, I can't do that. Or it could be the extreme bitterness. In any case, the gameplay consists of some good, and many bad ideas thrown together at odd angles with an end result that just isn't entertaining. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.   The story in Glover isn't particularly ambitious, and is told through some really mediocre FMV. Basically, the adventure begins when our friendly neighborhood wizard, whose goal is to watch over the kingdom's crystals, conduct a mystical experiment that ends up knocking the gloves off his hands (can't say as I've ever had my gloves knocked off, but I guess it could happen), with one of them landing in the cauldron. We'd like to assume that the brew contained some really elaborate magical qualities, as it caused the gloves to come to life, with one (conveniently for the story) being good and the other being evil. Unfortunately for the Kingdom, the explosion also scattered the magical crystals all throughout the land. The good hand, Glover, takes it upon himself to recover the crystals and restore peace and order to the galaxy.   Oh, and the evil glove is also trying to recover the crystals, for his own unknown, but presumably very evil agenda. That sure spices things up.  Contrary to what the story premise seems to imply, the game really isn't a moronic scavenger hunt. Rather than your main challenge in each area being to find the crystals, the real goal is to bring the crystals to the end of each level. Somehow, the crystals have assumed the likeness of balls, and Glover has the ability to change their characteristics, ranging from bouncy rubber to metal, for the purpose of finishing various puzzles or getting past certain obstacles. For instance, with a heavy form, the ball will weigh Glover down and enable him to move quickly along the bottom of a lake. Or, with a magnetic ball bearing-esque form, the ball will enable Glover to reach places he otherwise couldn't by rolling it along the wall or ceiling.  Glover has a few cans of whup-@ss in his arsenal, but in no flavors we haven't seen before. Glover's primary means of spreading carnage is the Fist Drop, which is effectively the overused butt-smash move originally coined by Mario in Super Mario 64. Glover also possesses the ability to hurl the ball at his foes -- It does good damage, but mostly isn't usable because of how difficult it is to aim, especially considering the typical small size of the low level cronies (which, incidentally, seem more like an after-thought to puzzle elements, as they don't openly attack you and aren't very threatening).  As intuitive as some of this may sound, the gameplay really isn't very engrossing. Some of the puzzles and obstacles are charming, but, as a package, the game doesn't seem to work. Aside from the decidedly uninspired boss fights, the gameplay isn't very diverse and gets boring very quickly.  Graphics The game may possibly have survived despite mechanical blemishes, but, unfortunately, the overall sour look of the game drags the experience down even more. Simply put, the game looks bad -- Not just compared to its Nintendo 64 brother, but to other PlayStation games, as well. The game features the trademark PlayStation pixelation in abundance, with an annoyingly inconsistant framerate smashing that big ol' nail straight through the coffin and into the floor.  The environments themselves aren't even the least bit ambitious in design -- It's as if the makers just stepped back before even trying to bring the levels to life. The various grassy planes, dirt hills, structures, and bodies of water are all presented with plain, lifeless textures and a sub-PS-norm polygon counts. I could go on, but I think I've made myself, unlike the visuals, perfectly clear.  Sound The overall sound scheme in Glover isn't particularly bad, but certainly far from good. The basic cutesy platformer sound effects are all there, along with some eerily subtle music. The music is charming and non-threatening when examined, but when combined with the overall play experience, somehow manages to turn into something eerie and strange, making the whole experience seep into your subconscious. Eek. Overall, Glover is a gaming experience that anyone could do without. There isn't one individual element that brings the whole thing down, it's a collaborative effort. There are a few good ideas present, but the makers didn't play them well, so we end up with a final product that just isn't fun or rewarding to play. I'll leave it up to the obvious. Mediocre gameplay + Bad graphics = Bad game. If you're curious, give it a rental -- But definitely don't plunk down a few dozen Washingtons for it. Money like that would be better spent on something with purpose, like many pounds of cheese.", "date": "Jan 4, 2000"}
