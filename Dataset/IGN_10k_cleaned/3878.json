Don't worry, you won't be punished.  (Tal's cat-o-nine-tails is in for re-varnishing, anyway.)  Most of us came to that conclusion sometime over the last three years, when the game's developers repeatedly showed more basic visual sequences with pride at successive E3's.  When I asked at the first one, ~What sort of strategic game have you got underlying these screens?~ I was met with all the maddened outrage of a nesting female mink that had been disturbed.  How dare I ask about substance instead of just pretty pictures!  I was press, after all: I was supposed to just praise to the skies, not question.   Alas, questioning is a skill I've gotten rather good at it in this business in a decade-and-a-half, regardless of whom I displease, and praising is not something I will do indiscriminately.  Three years have passed, and the pictures, while still pretty, don't really have that much to do with gameplay in Republic: The Revolution.  Still, there is a strategy game underneath it all that's worth playing, if you don't mind jumping the hurdles to enjoyment that Elixir Studios has thoughtfully placed in the way.   Baaaack in the USSR  The game takes place in Novistrana, a nation caught between a thousand year tradition of totalitarianism and a spirit of self-sacrifice and political action.  Brezhnev-style Communism has fallen, and the feared chief of the secret police, Vasily Karasov, has taken the reins of government.  He has proven a poor leader, with no apparent plans for government save Stalinist personal glorification and repressive tactics.  As poverty increases and dissatisfaction rises, small political cells begin forming around local leaders whose organizations promise an alternative.  Each must fight not only Karasov, but its fledging opponents, in a bid to impose its authority and vision on the future of Novistrana.  Will you become the next leader, or merely a footnote in history books published in the West?   No points are awarded, here, for discovering the post-Soviet states and their troubles in ailing Novistrana.  (But if you want a good, light read on Russian history, check out James Billington's The Icon and the Axe.  My wife has asked me to pass along that my idea of a light read is a trilogy on pan-European economic history during the Renaissance, but don't listen to her.  She's prejudiced.)  Elixir has done a good research job, patterning the structures of Novistranian activity and the style of its tyrants all too well after real life examples.  (Though admittedly it's difficult to be more grotesque than Turkmenistan's President-for-Life Niyazov, who declared last year his desire to rename the days and months, substituting, among others, his own official name for ~January.~)  For gaming purposes, all philosophies and methods of achieving power have been reduced to three generic types: Force, Influence, and Wealth.  At its simplest level, this is the familiar paper-rock-scissors paradigm, with Force-based groups always having a bonus to activities undertaken in Influence-based city districts, but a weakness in Wealth-based districts, etc.  Greater complexities enter the picture when factions attempt to gain and hold the allegiance of citizens who are in different ideological camps.  Certain specific game goals, too, are easier to achieve for factions or faction members whose talents lie in one ideological direction or another.   To determine your ideological stance at the beginning of the game, Republic: The Revolution has you answer a series of ten multiple-choice questions.  The results are weighted, so that you can begin with anything from approximate equality in all three ideological strands to an extremist stance emphasizing a single one.  Your answers also help determine your initial attribute values in Status, Control, Charisma and Presence.  On a personal level, these influence your relationships with followers and the success of certain missions.  In followers, these attributes affect the success rates of Actions you assign to each.    Actions?  They're your only way to interact with the world of Novistrana and its inhabitants.  I count less than seventy actions you or subordinates can perform, and those are really less than twenty-five: each action simply has its Force, Influence, and Wealth-based equivalent.  So you could weaken a character in an opposing faction by employing Assault (Force), Frame (Influence) or Debt Collection (Wealth), though they produce the same result.  The reasons for selecting one over the others would have to do with your ideological base, available ideological points and your followers' strengths.      You and your followers make levels as you gain experience, through successfully performing actions.  Each level brings rewards: new, higher level actions you can perform, old actions that are now more powerful, and points to spend on increasing attributes.  (One attribute I haven't yet mentioned, Resolve, can't be manually improved.  It depends upon several other factors, such as NPC vs. Ideology.  IF you run a heavily Force-based faction and manage to recruit someone who believes strongly in the power of Wealth, their resolve will begin low and drop precipitously.  A character strengthening action, like Wealth-based Gift is recommended to keep them in line.)   Note that all factions and people in Novistrana aside from yourself remain ideologically static.  Your faction, however, changes according to the actions you employ.  If you attempt to protect a faction member by using the Safe House action, which is Wealth-based, your faction will shift slightly towards Wealth in its ideological position.  Engage in enough actions associated with a single ideology, and you could end up alienating some current followers and finding it easier to secure new allies.   And that, kiddies, will give you a rough idea of gameplay in Republic: The Revolution.  It's an intriguing spin on a rarely seen type of strategy that mixes controlled expansion with dirty tricks: Stardock Games' Corporate Machine, for instance, or Ruthless.com, the Game Red Storm Would Rather Forget. (Fine gameplay; visually, the most boring thing since Parchesi.  Sold in the dozens.)  The addition of RPG elements and a distinctive cultural/visual setting helps give the new title a unique flavor, something that is sorely lacking in both the other titles despite their excellent AI.   Five Views on Life  The skies over this game begin to cloud over when we consider accessing its contents.  Simply put, the interface is anything but intuitive, and clearly illustrates the change of direction that occurred as game development switched from a hands-on, tactical perspective to a more distant, strategic one.   Some things never completely made the jump, and Republic: The Revolution's manual is one of them.  Early on, it describes the Rooftop View as the main view used for play, but that's definitely not the case in the finished product.  It offers us a beautiful, isometric 3D display of Novistrana, utilizing a mixture of architectural styles that brings the late Soviet Era to mind: a combination of neo-classical buildings from the times of Czar Peter and Czarina Catherine, the domes of Eastern Orthodoxy, Stalin's oversized concrete monstrosities, and the shabby, anonymous buildings that form a mausoleum for most huge cities' souls.  Everything has a description you can bring up if you click twice, but you won't have any time to spend there.  The ticking clock, which stops for no activity, gives your character four minutes per day part, and you'll need to make every minute count.  (You get one action per day part: three per day.  The members of your inner circle of followers have two per day.  Wimps.)   By contrast, the music of James Hannigan lends real atmosphere wherever you are in the game, adjusting to specific actions.  The opening theme creates an excellent sense of melancholy foreboding, and recalls Mussorgsky in its folk inflected character.   There's another problem associated with the Rooftop View, and also the Ground View, which is equally useless (and simply takes a slightly lower camera angle): the graphics will slow your computer so badly that they make Morrowind look like Tetris.  You'll need an enormous amount of memory and the fastest computer and video card you can purchase just to make it chug along with graphical options set roughly midway to max.    The Action View is, well, midway between the Rooftop and Ground Views, but actually has a reason to exist...sometimes.  Many actions call for no direct involvement on your part at all, so the elaborate display involving recruits bonding with you or canvassing neighborhoods is so much fluff, about as useful as one of those movie clips many companies put into their games in lieu of gameplay.  On the other hand, I really like the ambiance of Novistrana, the language, the facial and body gestures of its inhabitants, even the occasional poster advertisements for a cigarette that's called ~Bullfrog~ as written using Cyrillic characters (Bullfrog being the old stomping grounds of Elixir Studios' founder, Demis Hassabis).  But again, you really can't afford to take out the time from your strategic machinations, not while you're monitoring activities in the city districts, selecting actions for your faction members, assessing their level of support, allocating points as they make levels, etc.     Just occasionally, the Action View is necessary, and part of the old game design comes through.  This happens when you must get personally involved, especially in some linear missions and conversations to recruit your inner circle.  Like occasional combat in some other strategy games, you can always leave this to the computer to resolve, with an almost 100% assurance that it will muck things up for you badly.  (As conversations form a separate gaming sub-system, we'll look more closely at it, later.)   The fourth View is the Faction Screen.  This is a static but powerfully effective image with yourself at the center of a five-pointed star.  Your five handpicked lieutenants form its rays, and the distance they are from you shows their current degree of commitment.  You can also check your current faction ideology on this View, the actions each follower can use, and those members of other factions whose identities you know.  If one of your people is moving too far out of orbit, it may be time for a little personal massaging; or you might just want to consider dropping them for the team, and currying the favor of another associate.   The Satellite View is where you'll really be spending all your time in the game, manual to the contrary: a sprawling, city-wide map image, where you can check on the level of factional commitment from every district, and schedule and observe the results of actions in considerable detail.  It's easy on the video card, and allows you quickest access to all the information and actions in your current city (whether Ekatrine, where you start, Pugachev or Berezina, each with an increasing level of challenge).   Unfortunately, scrolling is a problem in the Satellite View.  As anybody knows who is familiar with PC game control conventions, when you move the mouse to the side of the screen, the image is supposed to pan.  All three cities where you play Republic: The Revolution are too big to fit into a single screen, but the only way to pan them is to move the mouse to the edge of screen, then right-click.  It's impossible to judge the amount of screen movement this will produce, since it isn't based on hand-directed mouse movement.  This also gets in the way of other mouse-related movements.  When you right-click to remove small informational icons that periodically popup above your character portrait in the lower left hand portion of the screen, the screen pans, whether you want it to or not.   There are other problems here, as well.  The overlay of information on individual districts in the Satellite View quickly becomes a confusing mess as the game progresses.  Character, action, rival action, misinformation action icons and support level pie charts cluster chaotically.  You can turn off any of these individually, but there seems to be no way to turn off all action icons with a single click in order to look at support.    Lack of consistency among controls with general Windows conventions is another issue.  The Diary in Republic: The Revolution isn't listed as a View, perhaps because its content of objectives (missions), memos and newspaper clippings occur in front of other View screens, rather than replacing them.  That being so, you'd expect the Diary to follow general Windows usage and have a small ~x~ in the upper right hand corner of the notepad image that you could close to return to the View.  Only that isn't what happens: instead, the button is a relatively large globe, and it's in the upper right portion of the entire screen.  This same method of closing a screen is used for the Action, Ground, Faction and Rooftop Views, which would seem to identify the Diary as a separate View in its own right.  Nor can you hit [ESC] to back out of the Diary, another common gaming convention.  That merely brings up the game controls (Quit/Save/Options etc) screen.      The other controls available in Republic: The Revolution aren't difficult to operate, but they take some getting used to.  Many gamers that have experience with arcane control pad systems will have none at all with personal planners; this probably should have been taken into account when creating a personal planning tool for you and your lieutenants in the game.  Elixir furnishes no tutorial or sandbox mode, but a few illustrated, non-interactive screens with key elements discussed.  Some questions remain unanswered or are hard to read, because of the reduction in size required to display the explanatory text.  There are tooltips over all the icons and controls in the Satellite View, but these take precious seconds to popup, during which, yet again, the clock is ticking.  A former Bullfrog employee once let me know categorically that all gamers who required help to understand game controls were ~wusses,~ as opposed to those who simply failed, and failed again, until they got the hang of a new product.  This may be viable as a treatment program for new Marine recruits if you're trying to beat down some egos, but I'm not sure it's an effective way of increasing game sales.     The Fine Art of Conversation  There are a few times when you wish to convince another character in Novistrana to undertake a specific course of action, usually to join your cause as a member of your inner circle (Headhunt).  When that happens, Republic: The Revolution switches to the Action View, and brings up the Conversation dialog box.  Here, it gives you and your opponent each a number of conversation points, based on Resolve, character level, action type, and ideological compatibility.  You then allocate these points across four different ~arguments.~  You're given thirty seconds to do this, after which the computer does it for you.   A series of four rounds then commences.  You play an argument (Self-Deprecation, Press, Ego Boost, etc), and your adversary repels it with one of his or her own (Ignore, Reason, etc).  The type of argument doesn't matter.  All that does is the number of points you've invested in that round.  If you've invested more than your opponent, you win.  The winner of that round receives a number of points, and the points available increase over the four rounds.  At the conclusion of the fourth round both you and your opponent know where you've each allocated your conversation points, and the next four rounds takes place under similar auspices, in light of that knowledge.   At the conclusion of the conversation, you've either met the number of points necessary to win it, or lost.  You can also win it handily, raising the Resolve level above the normal for that newly recruited follower, or lose it resoundingly, resulting in an angry letter that makes it clear this person will not desire to give birth to your children if you come to their doorstep in the near future.   It's a cute system; I'll give it that.  I had fun watching the various gestures accompanying the arguments, and listening to the voices.  However, the pleasures of the graphics eventually wear thin, and I admit that by the time I was attempting to recruit my fifth lieutenant, I would have been just as happy to do so from an attractive but non-3D screen.  I would also have liked to see a more sophisticated arguments system, one that allowed me to offer resources as bribes: extra publicity to a professor's new book, for example.      Would You Want to Live in Novistrana?  You may feel otherwise, but I can live with the issues of frustration associated with Republic: The Revolution: its very steep learning curve, poorly organized manual, long loading time, slow graphics display and messy Satellite View.  The reasonably good AI and non-linear portions of gameplay (which make Novistrana feel a lot freer than many Bullfrog titles) are both positives, and the linear missions can often be approached from different interesting angles.  There are several levels of difficulty, and playing an extreme faction associated with one ideology or a more moderate mixing of ideological strands adds significant replay value.  Then, too, the music by James Hannigan lends real atmosphere wherever you are in the game, adjusting to specific actions.  (The opening theme creates an excellent sense of melancholy foreboding, and recalls Mussorgsky in its folk-inflected character.)    Had anybody been fool enough to ask what I wanted out of such a game long before its release, though, I would have suggested more actions in general: buying, trading and selling individual resources like gold bouillon or opium (Wealth), mobile pirate radio station transmitters (Influence) and gun caches (Force).  I would have also requested more levels of informational detail about each NPC in the game, which I could potentially utilize in conversation to encourage Resolveand just simply for the flavor of it all.  Needless to add, I would also have wanted some means of turning off the four-minute timer so I had a chance to simply enjoy the world the developers have created.   But there are some bugs associated with this game that should have been killed before it ever left Elixir, let alone Eidos.  Twice I ~won~ a headhunt for a new lieutenant, for instance, only to receive the harsh refusal letter afterwards that always indicates unusual conversational failure; despite this, on both occasions the recruit became a lieutenant for my faction.  On a few occasions my Headhunter option was dulled out, and a popup informed me that my faction was full, although I had nobody else in my faction at the time.  Additional confusion is not something Republic: The Revolution needs.   Other problems I frankly admit may be a result of my misunderstanding the game rules, which are not always clear, especially to someone suffering from advanced senescence.  I can comprehend why scheduling a lieutenant's move to a new home requires not just their setting aside one time block, but my doing so, as well: after all, it's all about hiding them from my rivals, so of course, it should be done quietly, and that's why I, the faction leader, visit their home openly well, anyway.  I can more or less grasp this.  What I can't understand is why the option to move any other lieutenants grays out at that point.  I can schedule in advance; so can they.  It doesn't make any sense.That said, am I going to return to Novistrana, any time soon?  You bet.  I've already beat it on the Easy level doing a moderate mixed faction.  I'm in the middle of a moderately difficult game leading an extremist Wealth faction (called the Dubya Club).  If only I could employ all my lieutenants in oil companies...", "date": "Sep 3, 2003"}
