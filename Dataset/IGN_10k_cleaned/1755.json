NASCAR 98  has to be one of the greatest racing       games we have ever seen for the       PlayStation. This game has a good portion of the cars and       drivers, most of the tracks, and all the       options of the NASCAR circuit.        With EA Sports having        a NASCAR license, the game features 24 of the best NASCAR drivers       and their cars, including Bill Elliot and his       crazy McDonalds car. We'd sure like to pull       up to the drive-through in that baby. The       game also includes 17 tracks, with nine       of them being road tracks and the other       eight being oval-courses. You can race up       to 300 laps on all 17 of the tracks, which is a whole lot of driving!        Graphically, NASCAR is great. With a       smooth frame rate and very little draw-in,       NASCAR 98 looks and moves almost       flawlessly. Even with a crowded track the games moves butter smooth.  EA Sports, always a stickler to detail, has stayed true to its style. The track has the oil       spew-produced 'line,' the crude black line       that goes around the whole track. Most of the cars have their correct advertisers as well, which makes for a colorful driving experience.        The handling is very true to the track, even when you're packed in with tons of cars (which happens quite a bit due to the short nature of the oval tracks). The tendency to ram the cars back is tough to resist, but be careful or you'll end up against the wall.  If you're a fan of the NASCAR circuit, or just enjoy realistic racing, NASCAR 98 shouldn't be missed.", "date": "Sep 24, 1997"}
