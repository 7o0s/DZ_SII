The system was designed purely as a 2D machine...but here we are, playing the game that kicked off the whole first person shooter genre on the handheld machine. And what's more, the version created for play on the Game Boy Advance by Activision and David A. Palmer Productions is arguably better than some of the other ports created for systems such as the Atari Jaguar and the Sega 32X. Even better, the game that's nearly a decade old holds up extremely well as on the portable, and sets a standard of what's possible, at least in a technical sense, for first person shooters on the system.Features Three episodes 24 levels Link cable mode for four player deathmatch and two player co-op. (multiple cartridges needed) Battery save (four slots) Only for Game Boy AdvanceDon't think for a second that this will be the only, or the absolute first person shooter to own. Doom on the Game Boy Advance has the luxury of namesake -- Doom was the game to play back in the day, due to its extremely tight design and development, over-the-top action and violence, and because, well, it was free (it was the game that gave the shareware market a huge shot in the arm). The Game Boy Advance developers had access to the code, the artwork, the sound library, and the already-established gameplay, so in essence Doom on the GBA is a testament to how well the developer was able to work all the elements into play on the portable hardware, and just how well a classic PC shooter works on the system. Even so, it is excellent in both cases...Doom makes for a fantastic Game Boy Advance action title even after it's been out on every single system ever conceived.As first person shooters go, Doom's game design is definitely showing its age, and since the GBA version is a 99.9% port of the original, the same is true here. There's no real goal set out for you to accomplish other than to blast your way through two dozen levels of alien-infested space colonies (8 levels each in three ~worlds~) without getting yourself killed in the process. And when it's over, there's no massive fanfare or glitzy ending...it's just over. Thanks for playing, buh-bye. But even so, it's the rush of the action that gives Doom its overall draw -- its tight controls, its clever, complex-but-simplistic level design, and its distinctly different enemy characters all pile together in a design that makes the game a guilty pleasure shooter on the system. The system even handles the game controls well on its four action buttons, with the two shoulder buttons performing the absolutely necessary strafing functions as well as the weapon select commands.The game engine may be extremely limiting to what's being used in first person shooters today, but the code the drives Doom still allows for some extremely elaborate level design. Worlds go indoors and outdoors, up and down elevator shafts, over ledges and through secret passages. The game even features lighting effects to create a specific mood for the whole ~space marine~ feel -- rooms will darken in places, and some areas will have strobing illumination to simulate busted florescent overhead lights. Even more impressive, the engine features ceiling, floor, and ceiling textures throughout the levels -- the only thing scaled back graphically is the actual screen resolution; characters and textures tend to get blurry off into the distance due to the reduced resolution stretched to fit the screen. Doom on the GBA will set the standard for what's expected in first-person shooters on the handheld system...Doom has proven that a lot is possible on the hardware when it comes to raycasting engines, so gamers will be watching to see how well the engines advance in the system's later years. And to the kids out there who'll complain about the blood being green in this game: get a life. If having red blood had kept Doom off the Game Boy Advance, you wouldn't even have a game to complain about. The color of the bodily fluids is so trivial you probably won't even care after your fifth or sixth zombie blasts open with a shotgun shell. The game is perfectly violent as is, thank you very much...As good as Doom is on the GBA, it isn't without its issues. The game is, really, just a port without offering anything new. 24 levels can only take you so far, and as great as the game turned out on the Game Boy Advance, the chances are good that you've seen most of this before. But this little element does seem to work to the game's advantage, since many times through these levels I was taken back to the original, just reveling in the feeling of just how great Doom used to be. The Game Boy Advance port of the Doom engine is a definite feat in itself, as the game retains a playable framerate throughout most of the action...but it does chug a bit in places when the rooms become spacious and a bit more complex. To remedy this framerate drop, the developer included a toggle switch to let gamers turn on and off the Dynamic Lighting effects. Unfortunately, several levels depend on the mood lighting in their design, so to turn off the feature means to flood the corridors with equal amounts of light, eliminating the eeriness of some of the level layouts. The developers also remove dead bodies from the scene nearly immediately after they flump to the ground, supposedly due to memory and framerate constraints...which is kind of a drag since, in the original, players would remember where they were by the collected corpses in the room. The one big gameplay change: save games only occur during the end of a completed level...but in my opinion that's a plus since gamers can no longer inch their way through levels, saving everytime they've hit a difficult area.And while the multiplayer aspects of GBA Doom are some of the most exciting in the cartridge, it's also where most of the disappointment comes from. The game features four player link cable mode for deathmatch in most of the game's single player levels (you'll need a cartridge per system involved), and the framerate only takes a slight, acceptable hit during the fast action play. It's awesome going up against your friends to see who's going to come up on top, but the developers failed to make this mode, well, informative. Select Deathmatch, and four players are going up against each other, but without any on-screen indicators, it's all a mystery during the battle. There's no text to show who you killed, who killed you, how many kills you have, or how much time is on the clock. Only when the time runs out and you're faced with the conclusion of the battle do you have any idea of just what happened during the bout. The two player cooperation mode also lacks an important feature: saving a game in progress.It's definitely thrilling to see such a small system push a game only the big boys have been able to push -- Doom on the Game Boy Advance is excellent fun that's hurt only by its unestablished multiplayer mode and its overall been-there-done-that feeling. The game does have some holes that needed filling during development, but even so, it's an absolute keeper for your GBA library.", "date": "Nov 2, 2001"}
