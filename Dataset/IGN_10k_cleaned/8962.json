Some say Double Dragon, some say Bad Dudes. I have always maintained that Streets of Rage 2 is the cream of the crop. After spending a few hours with SOR2 on XBLA, my feelings have been validated. Many of the side-scrollers of yesteryear don't stand the test of time. Streets of Rage 2 does. It's only when the game attempts to step into the 21st century that it fails.   Before hitting the streets and raging on the scumbags that have overtaken the city, you must choose from one of four characters. Each character has different stats that do make a difference in the game. You can play as the vivacious Blaze who is the most balanced of the four, Max the brawler, the ever-popular Axel (who can throw a mighty uppercut), and Skate. Oh, Skate. He's the pariah of SOR2. The little skate-wearing kid has some devastating attacks that some would call pure cheese. Who you choose does slightly change the gameplay experience. SOR2 characters have more moves than your average side-scroller and each character's moves are unique.   The eight levels of SOR2 take you across the city from downtown to the baseball stadium and on through the Syndicate stronghold. While many of the enemies you battle will become redundant, each level adds a new baddie that becomes part of the recycled crew. While you'll have seen one thug again and again, you'll have new enemies in the mix on a regular basis keeping things fresh.   Along with unique attack moves, each character has special powers that help them take on tougher opponents. Mapped to the Y button, a character's special attack does a good dose of damage to enemies, but also drains some of your health. The only real limit to how often you use your devastating special attack is dependant on how much you like to bleed yourself. Some special attacks, such as the chi blast from Blaze, aren't all that helpful. But then, a cheese character such as Skate has an overpowering special attack kick that can crush a boss.    While your characters are more than equipped to handle the dark denizens of the city, other weapons become available throughout the game. If an enemy is carrying someone to use against you, you can always take it from them. Knock an enemy down and they drop their weapon, which you can pick up to unleash extra damage. Use pipes, swords, knives and more on your quest to clean up the city. You can even throw a weapon for effect. Chuck a sword across the screen into an enemy's chest? Yeah, SOR2 delivers even after all these years.   In two-player co-op, things can get hectic. There is friendly fire, meaning that you throwing an enemy carelessly one way or the other can lead to your buddy getting knocked down. While you have to be more cautious playing with a teammate (unless you just want to hurt one another), you do get to tag-team enemies. Have one player grab a bad guy while your pal pummels them. It's fun for the whole family.   The only real limitation of SOR2 (at least offline) is the Xbox 360 controller. The D-Pad isn't great. And control of your character does suffer slightly. Those lucky enough to have an arcade stick (the new HORI VF5 stick rocks), have an advantage playing SOR2.   If you do want to play against a friend, either in co-op or a barebones vs. mode, you may find the online experience lacking. While you can play on the same system with no need for split-screen, most will pony up $5 for Streets of Rage 2 specifically to play online. And that's where SOR2 fails miserably. Playing on a great connection, with and against others with a solid ping time, SOR2 had excessive latency issues. There's a hideous delay between pressing a button and having the action occur. At least a second if not two. Hit jump. Wait. Wait. And now you jump. It's pretty awful.  Streets of Rage 2 really does stand the test of time. It is still one of the finest side-scrollers ever made. It's got a decent length for a game of its time and it certainly worth playing more than once. The visuals are surprisingly vibrant. Most importantly, it's fun. But the online portion of SOR2 is executed poorly. And, once again, Backbone Entertainment presents a classic SEGA title with absolutely no extras. Weak sauce. If you plan on playing SOR2 offline, this is a great buy, even for 400 Microsoft Points (US$5). But if your plan is to tackle the Streets online, you're better off passing up this classic.", "date": "Aug 30, 2007"}
