No less than three robotic action sims have been released over the past three months: Starsiege, MechWarrior 3 and Heavy Gear 2.  We had a lot of fun with Starsiege a few months ago and MechWarrior 3 is still getting a lot of play around the office, but how does the latest, Heavy Gear II, stack up against the competition?  Well, not too bad.  It's kind of like the porrage that Goldilocks ate, not too hot, but not too cold either.  It doesn't quite live up to MechWarrior 3's prowess, but it's certainly fun and it adds some new features to the giant robot genre.  If there's one thing Heavy Gear II does better than the other giant robot games it's variety -- variety in environments, variety in Gear loadout and variety in gameplay.  Unlike the original Heavy Gear where the landscapes looked fairly bland and similar, the topography in Heavy Gear II is extremely diverse.  You'll often go from the depths of space, to a gas-filled swamp, to a desert setting over the course of as many missions.  Unfortunately, many of the landscapes aren't as detailed as I would have liked, looking rather blocky with sparse environmental accoutrements.  But some, like the spacescape, look absolutely amazing!  The starfield is incredible -- there's not a millimeter of your screen that's not filled with stars.   In terms of your Gear's loadout, this game is a customizer's dream.  In the Gear lab you'll find over 70 weapons and 20 unit modifications, plus there's over 60 Gears to choose from in instant action mode.  Unlike MechWarrior 3 where your 'Mech's loadout is limited by weight, Heavy Gear II uses a threat rating to keep you from being too powerful.  For example, you can't just outfit your Gear with eight guided mortar launchers hoping to overpower your foes with sheer explosive power.  Instead, each weapon and mod has a certain effectiveness value to limit the number of additions you can make to your Gear.  To counterbalance your threat limit, Heavy Gear II uses a system of perks and flaws similar to the GURPS pen-and-paper system.  So, to lower the threat rating of your super-sniping Dark Cheetah Gear with jump jets you might add a few design flaws such as vulnerability to going haywire or a fragile chassis.  It's a system of pros and cons that allows you to make an extremely powerful Gear with a few Achilles' heels.  However, as much variety as Gear customization allows you, it is sort of a let down that you have to play the entire campaign mode in only one style of Gear.  Sure, you can customize that Gear in a variety of permutations, but having to keep the same body style isa let down if you like to experiment.  The gameplay in Heavy Gear II is very smooth and it feels a lot more like an arcade game than MechWarrior 3 or even Starsiege.  Since the Gears top out at about 15 feet tall instead of several stories, the game stresses speed and stealth rather than brute power.  In most of the missions you'll be grossly outnumbered, so you'll want to stay hidden until an opportunity arises where you can swiftly sweep down upon your enemies and fill them full of holes.  You can either use your legs to do the walking or sacrifice a little mobility for speed and pop out your retractable wheels.    The long campaign mode contains a lot of different scenarios and, while the game isn't very challenging in the beginning, it quickly gets tougher as you progress through the missions.  The individual sorties are short, but this just keeps you glued to the action since you're constantly changing objectives and locations.  In difference to the campaign mode, the historical missions represent some of the greatest battles in the annals of Heavy Gear, and are just plain hard.  If you really want to test out your Gear skills, this is the place to do it.    The game includes some nice visuals, like the starfield I mentioned earlier, but the art direction is inconsistent and I encountered a few clipping issues in some of the particularly rocky terrains.  The Gears themselves are well detailed and the rounded surfaces make them look very high-tech (even though they all look like they have elephantitis of the guns).  Real-time shadowing and lighting really add to the immersiveness of the title but, again, the special effects are inconsistent.  While the smoke trails left by spiraling rockets looks almost real enough to make you cough, the lasers are nothing more but colored lines that leave no marks on the opposing Gears or vehicles.  Those of you who are suckers for storyline will absolutely love the cutscenes as they are dramatic, well produced and visually stunning.  The sound production is handled well with a dramatic, intense soundtrack and fantastic voice-overs.  One neat feature is that the voices of your squad mates are customized for what pilots you pick, although often completely different pilots will repeat the same dialogue.  Unfortunately, the sound effects in the game are often lacking in parts and I expect more thuds and bellowing bass tones when I'm piloting a multi-ton Gear and using rockets and mortars to subdue my opponents.   After going at the computer controlled Gears, you'll probably want to take on a real challenge in the form of human pilots.  It's easy to set up a LAN game or even to find opponents on the Web with the built-in game finder, meaning you don't even to spawn out of the game to find some human challengers. Multiplay options modes include duels (one-on-one deathmatches), deathmatch, steal the beacon (keep from being killed while protecting a beacon), strategic (deathmatch with bases) and capture the flag.  There's not much new or innovative here, but it will keep you busy while you're taking time out from the campaign mode, especially once more people buy the game and there are more games avaliable.  While Heavy Gear II is a solid package, it does contain a few noticeable flaws.  Most notable is the quirky control system that almost requires a third hand.  Sure, you can remap every key, but the entire process of remapping every singe key took about fifteen minutes and, by the end, I couldn't remember what all of the keys did.  Doh!  So I just reverted back to the default settings whipped out the glossy reference card (something I never do ... it makes me feel like I'm cheating or something).  Heavy Gear II also shipped with a few crash bugs that proved to be frustrating.  While the campaign mode was stable on every system we played it on, the instant action and historical missions crashed on two of the four test PCs.  We weren't able to find a common link between the crashes (all of the systems had different video and sound cards), so we suspect that about half of you may run into some problems with those modes.  Rounding out the list of problems with Heavy Gear 2 is the inconsistent computer AI.  In hilly terrain you may have problems getting your squad members to follow you through the twisting canyons.  Even worse, the enemy AI sometimes doesn't even notice you even if you're standing right behind an enemy Gear.  I realize that I'm supposed to be stealthy, but it's hard not to notice a 14 foot metallic robot carrying a 12 foot gun when it's right behind you  Overall, Heavy Gear II is fun and engaging game which contains a few frustrating flaws, inconsistencies and bugs.  I hate to compare it to MechWarrior 3 with such impunity, but it's just such a similar concept that I have to.  Simply put, Heavy Gear II would have been a better value if it wasn't overshadowed by MechWarrior 3, but they are different enough to appeal to two separate groups.  Those of you who like quick, heart-thumping action will probably prefer Heavy Gear II.  If you're into more strategy and the feel of controlling a behemoth of a machine, then MechWarrior 3 is more your speed.  Regardless, both games are worthy contenders in the giant robot arena and you won't be disappointed with either ... or even both.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Jun 30, 1999"}
