And bargain prices on the GBA usually mean bargain development budgets, too, and that, in turn, more often than not converts into bland, substandard gaming experiences. Blades of Thunder definitely falls into this category. Oh, this action title starts out rather promising, what with an ambitious, pseudo-3D engine to drive the action. But the whole package is only half-baked, as if most of the resources went into the technical side during development. The actual game design lacks any real substance and comes of amazingly bland and repetitive, and any interest left over after the first level won't last long because there's absolutely no variety from mission to mission. Blades of Thunder shouldn't be confused with any videogame or movie that uses ~Thunder~ and ~Blade~ in their title as a metaphor for a helicopter. This is an original design for the GBA developed by Interactive Vision. Originally called Battle Hawks when it was in development last year, the game received a title change when Summitsoft picked the game up for publishing. Blades of Thunder may look like a sim-based game on the package, but this presentation's deceiving, as what you're getting is nothing more than a basic forward-scrolling arcade shooter in a 3D perspective. Think old-school, like Raiden or Axelay, but then dumb down the enemies and bring down the action to an unbearable crawl. That's Blades of Thunder.  Initially, Blades of Thunder is impressive because it's one of the first games to employ Voxel technology on the Game Boy Advance. This technique, assigning height value to pixels on a flat bitmap, is nothing new in the PC world, but it's a lost art due to its outdated visual ability in an era when texture-mapped polygons can do the job much better. But the GBA's horsepower and screen resolution, or lack thereof, is prime for the Voxel exploitation, but even on the handheld, the technical limitations prevent developers to really push the technique to its fullest. Blades of Thunder gets around the framerate issue and offers somewhat smooth animation because it doesn't move the camera freely; the action is on a forced scrolling field that never rotates.  Each level in Blades of Thunder is presented in ~mission~ form, where players have to wipe out primary and secondary targets in order to move on to the next round. There's not much to it; it's just a matter of weaving left and right, blasting enemies as they approach. On occasion, there will be escort portions where you'll follow a caravan to base and you'll have to protect the vehicles as they ride the rail, but other than that, this is shooting action at its most basic.  The biggest problem of Blades of Thunder is its level design, or rather, the lack of it. These missions go on far too long, since they're dragged out for miles and miles and miles with no indication on when things are going to end. And what's more, it's almost a challenge to die; you really have to suck to lose a life in Blades of Thunder, since it's too easy to weave out of the way of enemy fire, and their  power against your craft's hull is so minimal it's like being hit with a peashooter. It really feels like most of the development time was put into the graphic engine and almost nothing into the level progression and game design. When a game hits shelves with absolutely no fanfare, you can bet Vegas money that it's going to be awful. Summitsoft offered up no preliminary press for Blades of Thunder, and wouldn't you know it: it stinks. Blades of Thunder 2 is scheduled for a 2005 release on the Nintendo DS, and I'm crossing my fingers that the dual-screen version will be a far more realized game production than this crappy GBA title received.", "date": "Mar 29, 2005"}
