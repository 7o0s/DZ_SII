His best friend owned prize-fighting turkeys. These suckers could take your arm off. While my father and his friend went off to drink beer and examine the friend's wall trophies, I was left in the front yard with the prize-fighting turkeys (like royalty, they were allowed to roam freely). Because I was short in stature, the turkeys took me for a threat. Furthermore, they didn't like being petted. I let a few of them attack me with peck jabs and showy wing flapping for a while, but after they started ganging up and drawing blood with their claws, I decided to duck into my father's friend's trailer and feign blas disinterest in the turkeys to conceal my outrageous fear.  The man, my father's friend, didn't have a neck with any particular redness to it. I checked because I'd thought to myself upon entering the trailer to escape the demon birds, ~I've heard of so-called red necks, and this man, with his fighting turkeys and moose-head-adorned trailer walls, is most certainly one.~   Other than the movie Deliverance and a gas-station stop in Delaware while on my way to Boston, therein lies my only real experience with rednecks. Until now, that is. The good people at IGN, in their infinite generosity and goodwill, have bequeathed unto me the privilege of thoroughly playing through and reviewing Rage Games' Off-Road Redneck Racing, brought to us by the good peoples at 14 East by way of the People's Republic of Interplay. Rage Games, you may recall, brought us that graphics-fest Incoming a few years ago, which benchmarkers everywhere fell into paroxysms over until little snot bubbles accidentally slipped from their nostrils. Rage Games, you might also recall, is located in the gloomy isles of Great Britain.  Why is this important, you might ask? It's important because A) I say so and B) from the appalling dearth of intelligible redneck-speak in Off-Road Redneck Racing, I'd say it's a pretty safe bet that they don't raise prize-fighting turkeys in the gloomy isles of Great Britain. Which means the game designers at Rage probably never had blood drawn from them by anything with wings. Which makes me wonder why they attempted to make a game of redneck proportions when their only experience with things redneck could have come from a version of Deliverance translated into Great Britain language. (Smashing, old chap!)  That might explain why the game's three or so speech clips consist of ~blar blar blar Sunday SUNday SUNDAY blar blar blar,~ ~Hold onto your butt,~ and ~It's a good thing there's a helmet law.~ I don't think rednecks or any people of Southern descent really say those types of things. No, according to the good American version of Deliverance, rednecks say ~You sure do got a purty mouth~ and ~Squeal like a pig.~ (For those redneck aficionados out there, forgive my redneck-genus consolidation of Georgian mountain men with the more generalized species.)  The dubiousness of the game's ~redneck~ aspects aside, Off-Road Redneck Racing is indeed a further demonstration of Rage's prowess for creating great graphics. Not only do the cars look realistic and feature real drivers (some of whom drive on the wrong side of the car in the opening movie), but their wheels are round and visibly treaded, their paint jobs and reflective qualities are outstanding, and they fly through the air and hit bumps and spins both exhilaratingly and soundly in terms of physics. Furthermore, the game's twenty-four tracks feature enough distinctive variety to seize and retain your attention. Static cardboard-cutout spectators dot the sidelines, but despite their lack of animation, they look friendly enough. Also, the tracks are littered with crates and safety cones that smash or tumble along when you run into them, and dust and water fly up from your wheels when you zoom over dusty or watery terrain.  We're not exactly talking about a Gran Turismo-quality simulation racer here, but Rage did go a long way to make the game more than just a cartoonish arcade joy rider. As you win races you earn car upgrades (categorized as Exhaust, Turbo, Engine, and Gearbox), which are supposed to make winning subsequent races somewhat easier. You can't choose which upgrades you receive, and you don't really buy them. It's just assumed that your impecunious crew scrounged pennies until they came up with enough to acquire whichever upgrade you received. Console fans that happen to own PCs might not mind this so much, but diehard PC gamers might bristle at the lack of control when it comes to suping up their cars.  In the game's main mode, the Drivers' Championship, races are divided into four divisions of six tracks each. Your ranking throughout a division series determines your starting position for each race, though you start in sixth (out of six competitors) for the first race of each series. You're allotted three nitro boosts to help you keep up with the competition-which becomes incredibly difficult beyond the first couple of series. Not that the tracks are exceptionally hard to navigate, but it always seems that your competitors' cars have some ungodly mechanisms in them that let them maintain higher speeds and rates of acceleration than your car.  If you do manage to do well enough in a given series, you can qualify for a spot on a different team. If you satisfy the team's requirements (finish in one of the top three positions for the remaining three races, earn enough points by the end of a series, have at least two first-place finishes, etc.), you'll get to drive a different, possibly upgraded car and perhaps earn upgrades more quickly than if you'd stuck with your original team. Actually, it's kind of hard to tell what benefits joining a different team brings. (The game features 16 different car styles, most of which look like tricked-out jeeps, trucks, buggies, or muscle cars with monster-truck wheels.) Also, the only way to get promoted to the next division of races is to win the current division. Doing so requires earning the most points in a division, which means you'll have to finish in first place as much as possible, and when you don't, you better finish in second or third. Depending on your tolerance and interest in the game's level of detail, you'll likely decide that shooting for a promotion to the next division is either an exciting challenge or too hard to bother with.  Annoyingly, there's no quick way to restart a race in which you've performed poorly (which will happen on many an occasion). You have to quit the race, quit the Championship (which requires you to wait through a load screen), and then reload your previous save (which requires another load-screen wait). If you don't feel like messing with all that reloading, you can try out the game's Challenge and Time Trial modes. Challenge lets you race five other drivers on the track of your choice, and the Time Trial lets you race yourself for the best time on any particular track.  As for the actual driving, the cars handle surprisingly well just using the keyboard. They weren't as responsive to Sidewinder gamepad control, however. The pace of each race is well balanced, though a couple of opponent rednecks will always have some sort of computer-assisted advantage, such as fast cars or a prescient knowledge of track and shortcut layouts. Your best chance to win any of the later races will be to sabotage your opponents by cutting them off or running them into any of the trees, billboards, boulders, or construction vehicles that decorate the gorgeous tracks.  I'm still trying to figure out why Rage made this a ~redneck~ game, as opposed to a truck- or jeep-racing game. I mean, what's next? Redneck Soccer? Redneck Monopoly? The whole ~Redneck~ thing seems superfluous. Perhaps they made it Off-road ~Redneck~ Racing instead of just ~Off-road Racing~ because they wanted to lower gamers' expectations-so that gamers would be ~pleasantly surprised~ to find out how well the game looks and plays, despite the lack of quality that its name implies.  Appearances aside, Off-road Redneck Racing lacks depth. For instance, more should have been done with the Team Offer options. As I mentioned, it's hard to tell what benefits you gain from switching teams. The manual jokingly alludes to some foul play that once occurred when a McCoy driver joined a Hatfield team; if this sort of foul play were really possible, the game would've certainly earned some innovation and creativity points.  Also, there's a replay mode, but you can't save replays and being able to view them doesn't add much to the game. Despite the fact that you have three camera-angle options for racing (close, not-as-close, and first-person), you can't move the camera around for replays other than to switch to another car's perspective.  Other than the tracks being littered with chicken crates and located in the woods and under-development areas and such, the game doesn't have much redneck flavor. What I was looking for, what I would've considered appropriately low class is if, when I crashed, instead of being righted by an invisible hand like something out of Black & White, a competitor redneck would have stopped his buggy and come over to fart on my car's hood before hopping back into his buggy and zooming off. Now that would have been low class. Throw in some shotguns and prize-fighting turkeys... and let me use the shotguns for drive-bys on the turkeys, or let me run them over with my redneckmobile, and things would start to make a little more sense for me again.  -- Gil Alexander Shif  Want to share your opinions with the world?
