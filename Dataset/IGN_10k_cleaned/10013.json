The classic Track & Field formula of button mashing and timed taps really hasn't been improved upon since its inception and for good reason: it works, and works well. Knowing that, developer 49 Games and US publisher Conspiracy Entertainment set out to deliver old-school gameplay in a value-priced package. No, the goal wasn't exactly a lofty one, but the overall package is surprisingly robust for what it is.    ~It~ happens to refer to just nine basic events, though that's probably overstating the total number of different gameplay types. Events like the downhill, super-g and giant slalom are lumped together as one event type, but the skeleton, bobsled and luge -- all of which are even more similar than the downhill event -- are counted separately.    Regardless of the actual number of events, there's actually a modest amount of variety here, and perhaps most impressively of all, there's not really a stinker among them. Sure, some events are more fun than others, but none of them feel so wafer-then that you can't get some enjoyment out of each of them.     The bobsled/luge/skeleton courses have you hitting X out of the gate when a power meter is full, and then you simply have to stay off the sides of the tube in the straights and try to ride in a pre-set speed zone for as long as possible in the corners. The downhill events require only that you pass through the gates in sequence, though you can tuck for speed and carve for tighter turns with X and Circle, respectively. Cross-country skiing tasks you with holding X to build up power without tiring out, and the ski jump tests your ability to tap X to start, X to launch and X to land, with only balance and timing needed to score a solid jump.   The figure skating events are a super-simplified DDR-style rhythm action game that just has you pressing the face buttons when they swoop in from either side of the screen and land at the bottom. Speed skating is a bit more complex than most of the other events in that it starts out with an X/O button mashing sequence and then has you pressing and holding X then O alternately in rhythm with the strides of the skater. Because you can lean with the left analog stick and because the inside track means the skater's outside leg has a longer stride than the inside one, there is a bit of challenge in getting the proper rhythms down coming into and going out of turns.    The most involved event by far is curling, and believe it or not, it's probably the best of the bunch -- simply because there's quite a bit of strategy and physics that have to be taken into account. I finally learned why those two guys with brooms are constantly spazzing out in front of a little sliding rock. See, sweeping the ice actually creates a thin layer of water that the stone can slide on more easily. It lowers friction and, in the process, reduces spin (or, if you prefer, curl). By applying the right combination of power, spin and a bit of luck, you can get the stones to curve around each other, leading to some genuinely interesting shots.    Though the game offers the usual single-event modes and even 15- and 7-event stretches, the real meat of the game lies in the Campaign and Career Modes. The latter is just an extended 15-event stint, but getting podium finishes earns you experience points that can be applied to any of the event types. They're supposed to improve the abilities of your players, but I honestly didn't notice a difference. Campaign mode is where the game starts to find legs, however. Essentially a set of basic goals for each of the different events, the goals give the events a little more meat and some of the latter challenges are actually a little on the tough side. Sure, it's basic stuff like grabbing coins while heading down the luge or excelling in the ski jump, but it adds some semblance of progression to the game, and unlike the experience points earned in Career Mode, it's a real progression.   Wooosh! Perhaps most impressive about the game though is the overall presentation. Slick menus filled with falling snow, and translucent, icy blocks aren't going to blow anyone away, but they're miles ahead of most budget games, and actually rank as one of the better menus I've seen in a while on the PS2 (of course, given the games I've been playing, that's probably not a huge surprise). The environments and overall framerate of the events are equally pleasant to the eyes, but the rather stiff animations (despite apparently being motion captured) and athletes that look like Martians tend to drag the overall look of the game down.   Ditto for the commentary in the game, which at least attempts to inject a bit of color into the give and take between the hosts, but the voice actors are so dull and lifeless that the whole thing ends up sounding like both were doped up prior to entering the studio. Luckily, the rest of the effects work is nice and clean and the ambient loops on the menus are surprisingly good. The rock-inspired (and I do mean inspired; one of the tracks unceremoniously lifts the main riff from Saliva's ~Click, Click, Boom~) mid-event tracks, on the other hand, are a little grating.Winter Games 2008 is far, far better than either the price or uninspired title would lead you to believe. The extra meat found in the Campaign Mode at least gives the events a little more life, and the events themselves -- while not universally awesome -- are at least mildly fun across the board. In some cases, they can be plenty of fun in multiplayer with friends.", "date": "Feb 13, 2008"}
