Fantasy players are busy keeping track of injuries and statistics, pollsters are already ranking teams and predicting the Super Bowl, and Madden gamers are playing all the games out virtually on their home console systems.    It's been a standard practice for almost two decades now  football fans getting together on their own video gridirons, competing head to head to score touchdowns for their favorite teams. It's a gaming subculture that's evolved through the Genesis and SNES era, onto the PlayStation and PlayStation 2, and today rests in the HD realms of the Xbox 360 and PS3 and motion-controlled Wiimote waggling of the Wii. But it's a subculture that didn't just spring out of thin air. It first began, in earnest, when a few different developers all tried to create the best possible video game version of the sport, back around the late '80s and early '90s. And among that group was Nintendo, responsible for NES Play Action Football.   Four-player simultaneous play was the hook for this game, a flagship title used to promote the multi-tap peripherals for the NES hardware. And, played as intended with yourself and three other friends, NES Play Action Football was fairly addictive for the time. It first arrived a few years before the Madden series became truly popular, and was visually impressive for an 8-bit title. The issue with the game on the Virtual Console, though, is that it doesn't hold up well now taken out of the context of 1990. Too many other great football games have come along since.     NES Play Action Football tried to distance itself from the competition with a unique visual presentation, which broke out of the convention of presenting the field either horizontally or vertically and instead displayed it at an angle. It's something close to an isometric perspective, but more like a birds-eye view tilted to 45 degrees. The team on offense will always be marching up the field to the ~northeast~ corner of the screen, which works most of the time  but the orientation keeps you from being able to see much of what's happening on the right side of the field, in favor of rendering more of the left. The bottom quarter of the action, as well, is cut off in favor of a block of statistics and ever-present scoreboard.   The gameplay is fairly standard for an old-school football title, in that you're given a selection of plays to choose between before each down and make your selection by inputting a button combination. This is a convention that, unlike the diagonal field perspective, has lived on beyond Play Action  and the variety of different options to pass, run or blitz on defense is fairly robust here.   But the real draw does come back to NES Play Action's support for four players at once, which is more easily achieved here on the VC than it was on the NES. The 8-bit system required you to own an NES Four Score or NES Satellite plug-in peripheral to be able to handle four controllers at once, whereas four wireless Wiimotes do the trick just fine here. Most old-school football games only ever supported two player head-to-head play, so the option to team up with a partner and take on an opposing duo of humans is an interesting feature  though it may not be appealing enough unless you've already previously played Play Action.There's an old issue of Nintendo Power (Volume 19) that focused entirely on the different four-player capable games available on the NES. And on the cover of that issue, four suited-up NFL football players gathered around a small TV and played NES Play Action Football. It was a big deal, at the time. Not a lot of other companies were offering titles that supported that many simultaneous players. And the football gaming subculture was still so formative that it could have become a major focus of how the genre evolved.But it didn't. Though it was an admirable attempt, the innovations introduced in this game just didn't go on to have much influence in the end  Tecmo Bowl still reigned supreme on the NES, and the Madden series took over after that era and is still going strong today. The 500 Wii Point asking price for this title could be worth it for established fans of this game from back in the day, but most everyone else would be better served to pass it by in favor of Tecmo Bowl, or to hold out hope that one of the 16-bit Maddens sometime makes it to the Wii Shop.", "date": "Oct 5, 2007"}
