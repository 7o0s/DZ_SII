{"name": "Ultimate Spider-Man", "name_review": "Ultimate Spider-Man", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/10/11/ultimate-spider-man", "text": "released a few weeks ago for consoles to much fanfare, with both Marvel fans and gamers crowing about the game's fun webslinging mechanics and incredible attention to detail. MFORMA follows up on the title's momentum with a mobile edition of the game that apes the concept of playing as both Spider-Man and fan fave villain Venom.   As expected, each character opens up different game play opportunities, and as I worked my way through the game, I found myself having the same feelings about the mobile Ultimate Spider-Man that I did about the console game: It's far more fun to go on a destructive rampage with Venom than play it safe with Spidey. And with the Venom sequences being so entertaining, you're likely to feel your heart drop just a little when it's time to go back to playing as Spider-Man.   As Spider-Man, you perform predictable actions such as wrapping up criminals in webs, sticking to all surfaces to avoid traps and pitfalls, and rescue innocent civilians. The mechanics involved aren't un-fun by any stretch, but the element of freshness has just about evaporated. It doesn't help that Sony Pictures Digital recently released its own Spider-Man 2 game with some similar move sets. This is another reason why the Venom sequences are so enjoyable -- not only is it always fun to bust things up real good, but the ~playing as the bad guy~ angle doesn't get as much play in mobile. Perhaps the best move in Venom's malicious menagerie is his ability to grasp innocents with his tentacles and suck their life force dry. Twisted, yes. But fun.   Ultimately (no pun intended), I think MFORMA would have been better served to just get ride of the Spider-Man sequences entirely and concentrate on Venom. Playing as Venom, constantly having to beat back Spider-Man would have made the game a far more original experience that what Ultimate Spider-Man currently offers. I think fan awareness of Venom is high enough to support his own solo adventure at this point.   Ultimate Spider-Man is a very attractive mobile game, much more so that recent Spidey adventures, to say the least. The use of comic book palettes really makes the game pop off the screen. The purple Venom is expertly animated by mobile standards, too. The backgrounds can get a little dry, but then again, the focus of Ultimate Spider-Man is not skyscraper detail, but the heroes and villains that try to knock them down.  Ultimate Spider-Man is naturally going to appeal to the true believers, especially those that has already consumed the console game like Venom consumes a little girl's life energy. But the multitude of Spider-Man adventures already on mobile lessens the impact of Ultimate Spider-Man. I found myself really digging the Venom stuff, but the Spidey sequences reminded me that sometimes this gig really is a job. Hopefully MFORMA will consider giving Venom the entire spotlight in a new game, as it always feels good to be bad.", "date": "Oct 11, 2005"}
