And though the series had a tough time making the initial move to 3D a few years back, Ubisoft struck gold with the recently released Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. The game studio even commissioned a team to create a Game Boy Advance rendition of the update to the Prince of Persia franchise, and because the series was originally developed with a side view in mind, there was incredible potential that the team could revive the classic Prince of Persia gameplay on the handheld. Though the GBA team's take on the new design is a solid one, this portable game didn't get nearly the same outstanding treatment that the console teams put forth for the epic adventure. The pieces are in place, but they're loosely tied with a limp presentation and scattered, almost unfocused gameplay.FeaturesTwo playable charactersUnique time-based gameplayCartridge save (three slots)Connection with GameCube versionThe console's epic storyline has been scaled back considerably for the Game Boy Advance, at least in the way it unfolds on the small screen. Still screens and text boxes replace the high production FMV and voice acting of the bigger-budget version, and the storytelling on the handheld just can't convey anywhere near the same emotional impact. But the situation stands: you're the prince of persia who has been tricked into unleashing the Sands of Time, and the action has wreaked some evil havoc across the kingdom. The task is, of course, to right the wrong by utilizing the power of the Sands of Time to rid the kingdom of the curse. But that requires a huge excursion through a very expansive castle.For the Game Boy Advance version, there's obviously some inspiration from the original Prince of Persia game, but The Sands of Time is an entirely new development that seems to favor a quicker pace and more focus on direct action of the Prince. In the original game, it was a cautious, careful adventure where one mindless step could mean instant death; in The Sands of Time, the prince can zip around the different platforms faster than a Belmont in Dracula's castle. The game definitely has a puzzle focus, many of which require finding and tripping switches to open doors to the next room. But there's way more platform elements in this GBA game, and not in the same sense as the classic Prince of Persia; there are more  clich' platform designs in The Sands of Time, like moving ledges and spiked surfaces that are more suited for a Mario level than a castle in Persia, but at least the designers incorporated a lot of the key PoP ledge climbing in the mix. But a lot of the game's challenge is simply successfully leaping through the current area taking as little damage as possible. There's also a bit of Lost Vikings in the Game Boy Advance version, since players must take control of a second character to flip switches and take out enemies with an arrow shot. Her abilities are far more limiting, though, and her implementation isn't quite as clever because she can't do anything drastically different than the prince. It's more the other way around.The key element of The Sands of Time is, of course, the Sands of Time, and the designers worked this into the gameplay pretty well. Early in the game players have the opportunity to reverse time if there's enough sand power in the dagger; this comes in handy when taking a wrong step off a ledge, or getting slaughtered by an enemy. By holding the shoulder button down, players can rewind that action and try a different course of action. Later in the game players will be able to snag rings that can use the Sands of Time in different ways, like slowing time or stopping it altogether. This is good for reducing the speed of spinning blades or quick enemies, and is definitely used to good effect deeper in the adventure. One element that was removed from the console game revolves around a giant griffon that the prince must battle in different locations of the castle. Though it was yanked out of the PS2, GameCube and Xbox game, this element is the central action of the GBA design. The griffon is this game's ~boss battle,~ and every encounter requires a different plan of attack...most of which requires the different elements of the Sands of Time.As clever as some of the puzzle and gameplay elements are in The Sands of Time, the loose ends of the development really come through in the overall presentation. Level designs are spread out a bit too far, which makes it difficult to solve puzzles because many elements are located far offscreen. The combat element, one of the focuses in the console game, is such an afterthought in the GBA title; it tries to be a Castlevania game but the technique involved in getting rid of enemies just isn't implemented very well. Many bad guys simply stand around firing arrows or throwing axes, and all it requires is to run up to them and slash at them until they fall. And the ones that do move, like bats and giant gila monsters can be simply removed by waiting for them to come to you. The original, classic Prince of Persia had better swordfighting than this game...and it's disappointing to see a step back in this element in a more advanced sequel. The combat becomes worse due to bad collision detection: after the enemy falls, players must stab them in the chest to sap their energy, but this interface is incredibly wonky and must be done precisely. Too precisely, in fact, which makes it frustrating to rid enemies because the character animation didn't hit the enemy on the proper pixel.The GBA's presentation is nowhere near the same level as the console game, mostly due to the fact that the game had to be completed months before the bigger adventure. But the one area the developers came through is in the graphics. Player animation is incredibly fluid, which is definitely where the original PoP gained much of its notoriety. The game engine itself sneaks in little special effects, like translucent curtains or a particle effect, that shows the developers at least has a decent grasp on the GBA's capabilities. But the graphical and presentation impact in this game isn't nearly as much as what the console team pulled off for the home system renditions...there's not even a port (or NES emulation) of the classic Prince of Persia in the handheld version. Oh well.I'm a huge old-school Prince of Persia fan who's played through the original game several times on the Apple II computer more than a decade ago. The thought of an enhanced version of this game with new time-based elements was extremely exciting, but unfortunately the GBA team took the idea in a far more action-based direction than the careful puzzle design of the original. The Reverse, Slow, and Stop Time elements are definitely great ideas that make this game unique,  but most everything else about The Sands of Time's level design feels just a little sloppy...there's no sense of precision anymore. If there should be a sequel, the team needs to look back to see what made the original Prince of Persia so great. As is, this game's a lengthy and somewhat enjoyable adventure, but the little things hurt the overall picture.", "date": "Nov 12, 2003"}
