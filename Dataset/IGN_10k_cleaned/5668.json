The mobile maker has everything from casino games to sports games to simple one-touch puzzlers, such as the highly addictive Collapse!   Collapse! is based on the web game of the same name. The concept is simple. Lines of colored blocks rise from the bottom of the screen. You must move the cursor over groups of three or more like-colored blocks to make them vanish. But with new lines appearing every couple seconds, pushing blocks closer to the game-ending roof, you must think fast. Do you go for the easy combos? Or risk getting greedy by trying to set up major combos of six or more blocks?   That struggle will keep you glued to Collapse! for longer than you ever intended. The game's manic pacing is its greatest hook, as it moves fast enough to make you feel smug about clearing the screen. But that speed can be a twisted mistress, stealing away victory if you go too long without making any moves more significant than three-block combos.   There are the occasional colored balls that, when clicked on, will cause all blocks of that color to vanish. These become very coveted pieces, as if you learn to use one at just the right time, you can save yourself from certain doom and clear the screen like a champ.   Collapse! doesn't employ whiz-bang visuals -- but it doesn't have to. The game screen is simple and clean, the colors bright but not obnoxious.Collapse! is one of those little puzzlers that sneak up on you. Before you know it, you are looking forward to stolen minutes with it -- even if you have what sound like more complex distractions (like a television show or a console game) at your disposal. If you are even remotely into puzzle games, Collapse! is a must-nab.", "date": "Apr 7, 2005"}
