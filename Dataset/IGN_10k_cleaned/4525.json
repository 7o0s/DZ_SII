We're never gonna see a full-blown RPG on this generation of cellphones. Sweeping story arcs, huge bestiaries, and hellzapoppin' magic spells are lost on these tiny screens powered by weaker chips, limited speakers, and low memory buffers. All that RPG fans are left with are dungeon-crawlers. And Fat Frog Studios has delivered quite the little crawler with their latest: Eye of Rana.  Features:  Top-down view Random generated dungeons Three characters classes  31 monsters 1200 items  Before every single RPG inspired with be the successor of Final Fantasy, the chief breed of RPG was the dungeon crawler. A simple affair where a stout adventurer braved the depths of sprawling catacombs, collecting items and fighting off hordes of monsters. Eye of Rana follows in the great tradition of this sub-genre, reminding us of the Epyx classic, Gateway to Apshai.  As you begin Eye of Rana, you must create a avatar for the upcoming crawl. You can choose from three templates -- warrior, wizard, or rogue -- or dive into a fairly deep character creator that allows you to tweak your digital self to your personal liking. Slap a moniker on the little fella, and you're ready to roll.  Eye of Rana's real estate is completely random. No two games are alike. You wind around the massive levels, heading down curving hallways into larger rooms that usually contain gold, items, and monsters. Some of the items affect your well-being, such as armor, others are upgraded weapons that help dish out damage against the dungeon denizens. There are over 1,200 total items in Eye of Rana, and impressive feat for such a small footprint the game leaves in your handset's memory.  There are 31 different types of monsters roaming the hallways below. Combat is easy to get the hang of, too. Just walk up to one of these offensive brutes and press the ~action~ button to initiate an attack. Then, press the touchpad in the direction you want to attack. A meter along the bottom of the screen empties out, and only when it refills can you launch another assault. In addition to basic melee attacks, there are ranged weapons, like bows, that allow you to fend off foes from afar.  Because the dungeons are so huge, Eye of Rana comes equipped with an in-game map, accessible by pressing ~#.~ You can monitor your character's health and stats by pressing ~*,~ but there is a ~cheat sheet~ of stats displayed at the bottom of the screen.  Eye of Rana looks pretty nice, considering the limitations of some handsets. Your avatar is hardly life-like -- he's just a superdeformed little fella. The monster sprites are varied, and the dungeons feature different textures, like rocks and mushrooms. As you dive beneath the surface, the walls change color, too. However, the game is fairly quiet -- the most audio you hear is the Fat Frog ~rabbit~ and some minor attacks sounds. Eye of Rana looks like a relatively simple game on the surface, but once you spend ten minutes with it -- you're hooked. The amount of variety is surprising, from the 31 monsters to the sheer number of items -- most of which you'll never see, unless you spend a great deal of time with the game. And we're betting you will. Is Eye of Rana ground-breaking? Not in any way. But it nails a genre, and fans of crawlers will certainly be pleased by the obvious amount of effort that went into the game.", "date": "Mar 7, 2004"}
