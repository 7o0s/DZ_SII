I wasn't a big fan of the original, PS2 incarnation.  I couldn't see what all the hooplah was about.  It wasn't much of a challenge, the controls felt stiff, and it ended too soon.  Capcom has tweaked the gameplay, slipped in a handful of new enemies, and added some new wrinkles to make for a much stronger gaming experience.  Hallelujah, I've been converted!  There are two ways to address Genma Onimusha.  First, I have to look at it as its own concept, judge the game as a stand alone on the Xbox.  But, I also have to consider that this game is not a sequel.  It's a port of a game that came out a year ago on a less powerful system.  It would only be fair to the game to consider it as its own entity.  And it would only be fair to the gamer to compare Genma to the original.  For the majority of this review, I'll be looking at this pretty little game as if it were brand new.  And then for those comparison shoppers out there, I'll gab a bit about what separates the two.  Features  Fast and furious combat with some seriously ugly demons Beautifully rendered environments Numerous puzzles to solve New enemies to slash and areas to explore Gameplay Genma takes place in Feudal Japan, where the battle for territory and power is deadly.  And just like the real Japan of old, there are plenty of demons and ogres wandering around trying to splice you.  You play two warriors:  Samanosuke, a studly sword-wielding samurai and Kaede, the prettiest ninja to ever slice a demons throat.  Together they go after some badass demons to rescue kidnapped Princess Yuki.   You play primarily with Samanosuke, who is not only gifted with his blade, but has the ability to absorb the souls of the demons he battles.  Swordplay is the name of the game (okay, it's actually Genma Onimusha) and there is swordplay aplenty.  This is not merely a hack-and-slash game.  Enemies can block attacks and the only way to survive is with stellar defense.  Along with normal button-tapping cuts and slices, Samanosuke can charge his sword for more powerful blows.   Learning to block and dodge effectively is crucial to passing the game.  Rarely do you face a lone enemy.  Demons come in packs, attacking from all sides.  In the early goings, when my sword was weaker, I would groan when five demons popped up around me.  After a few goes of it, I found myself hoping there would be a half dozen demons behind the next door.    The clashing of swords feels real, fluid, and is a ton of fun.  Genma uses pre-rendered backgrounds with a static camera, now a staple of Capcom action games.  The static camera can sometimes lead to your demise.  Occasionally, you get swarmed by demons and can't even see yourself.  Or you will be taking hits from an off screen enemy.  Capcom made great strides in solving this problem with Devil May Cry, but the intelligent camera of DMC is nowhere to be found here.  By far, this is Genma's biggest problem.  If you've never played Resident Evil or DMC, the game may frustrate you.  The action is too fast and the areas too confined for static cameras.  Your battle strategy not only includes how to handle a certain foe, but also how to position yourself for the best view so you know when to block, attack, and suck up some souls.  Facing the second boss, Marcellus, on the rooftop, I was getting creamed whenever I was in one section of the roof because I just couldn't see what I was doing.  I had to swing around and run to the other end of the roof to get a camera angle change.  Then I gutted the bastard.   Samanosuke doesn't just swing a sword, he can also absorb souls released when he gets a good strike on a demon, or when a demon dies.  There are four different colors of soul:  Pink, yellow, white, and green.  Pink souls can be collected and used to upgrade weapons and objects.  Yellow souls replenish your health.  White souls fill up your magic meter.  Green souls are, perhaps, the most important in the game.  Once you have absorbed five green souls you'll be able to become temporarily invulnerable.  However, demons can also suck up green souls.  Often in combat, you'll have to battle demons for a green soul in a tug-of-war contest.  Tap A to gain the soul.  However, while tapping A, you can't block or attack, leaving you vulnerable.  If a demon absorbs a green soul, they turn red and go nuts.  And nutty demons are a bad thing.  This adds a good deal of complexity to combat, as you have to balance defending yourself with collecting souls.  Magic is a powerful weapon, best reserved for tough opponents.  There are three orbs (thunder, fire, wind) to be found in the game that can be attached to your sword.  Pressing Y will release a devastating attack.     Though Genma's is an action bust-em-up, there are puzzle-solving elements.  Some chests you find will require a piece of knowledge or a puzzle combination to unlock.  Capcom threw in a few lethal traps for good measure.  Most of them aren't very tough and it would have been nice to see a bit more emphasis on puzzles and just a shade less on eviscerating demons.   Capcom has had some memorable bosses in the past, but perhaps none better than the group found here.  Each boss takes a different strategy to beat and none of them can be passed without expert use of blocks and dodges.  The nastiest, who technically isn't a boss, is Ayame.  She's a possessed doll with a half dozen three-foot long blades.  She flies around slicing at poor Samanosuke.  If she gets close she'll latch on and go Dracula on his neck.  Worst of all, she can't be killed... and she reappears again and again to torment you.   Hecuba is another dandy.  She's a giant wasp who swoops down from the air to slash at you.  I had a tough time with her, till I realized I could blow her out of the air with my matchlock.  (Oh, did I mention you can find a gun?)   Samanosuke's partner, Kaede, is used sparingly.  The control between the two switches automatically as the story advances.  Kaede cannot absorb souls or bust out any magic, but that don't mean she can't lay waste to demons.  Fast and quick, Kaede has one very cool move.  She can flip over an opponent, land behind them and cut their throat.  Gruesome and oddly exciting.  As cool as the move is, I felt like I was missing out with Kaede.  With no souls to suck and no magic to cast, Kaede turns the game into straight button mashing hack galore.  They could have done more with her, but she seems like an afterthought.  Graphics The pre-rendered backgrounds look fantastic.  And there are nice touches, like rats scurrying in the background and a murder of crows looking over the dead.  The game looks awesome in every aspect.  Best by far is the opening sequence, which is easily one of the most attractive FMV sequences to play on any console.  Absolutely beautiful.  The grim details are exquisite.  If you don't think the maggots crawling out of that skull look real, you need your brain checked.   Every character is highly detailed and the animations are fluid.  There are no invisible bubbles (as seen in many other combat-heavy games) surrounding characters, causing space between two entities even when they are grapppling.  You get up close in personal with every demon.  Enemies appear solid and difficult to walk around (or step through).  And every item and monster is fully detailed.  There are several different costumes for both Samanosuke and Kaede, and each looks authentic.  My only wish was for a bit more variety with Samanosuke's moves.  After a while, combat gets a 'been there, done that' feel.  Sound Wow.  The orchestral soundtrack is top notch and a perfect fit for the atmosphere of Onimusha.  All of the necessary sounds are there.  Swords clang, Samanosuke grunts, and the air cracks with electricity when his thunder magic is unleashed.  While Genma is a survival horror game, the sound doesn't push it to the level of Resident Evil.  You don't hear demons lurking in nearby rooms, moaning or dragging their feet.  The game never gets creepy.  For an action game, the sound is good, but Capcom should have gone the extra step to truly frighten us.   You have the option of Japanese or English dubbing.  Though the English voice acting is far better than the absolutely horrendous acting found on just bout ever other survival horror game, the Japanese language track gives the game a better feel.  Subtitles are provided, so you won't miss any of the story if you choose to go the more authentic route and listen to the characters yak in Japanese.  Old Vs. New So how does Genma Onimusha compare with the PS2 version?  The new dusts the old.  Every aspect of the game is improved.  There are new monsters to battle and in certain spots, you'll have to contend with more baddies than in the original.  The original was a bit too easy.  With the need to battle for green souls, increased monster strength, and more beasties to contend with, Genma offers a great challenge.  There are also more costumes to find and a whole new tower to explore at the end.  Both games are still too short, but there is definitely more to come back for in the newest version.   In the end, Genma Onimusha is still just a port of a year-old title.  It's a great game on its own, but it's neither a sequel nor so different that it's unrecognizable.  The puzzles are the same and so are the most of the battle strategies.  The new additions keep the game from being stale, but it doesn't take full use of the Xbox.  This feels like many of the ports released so far on our beloved Xbox.  It looks great, but it still feels like something I could have on my PS2.  And that's what keeps Genma in the category of 'just another port', instead of being 'an astonishing new Xbox title'.   Yes, it is just a port, but heck, I really enjoyed it.  All of the changes Capcom made benefited the game.  There are some really nice touches in this game, like when I ran from Ayame.  I thought I'd lost her until I entered one room and caught a glimpse of her casually sitting in the rafters, waiting for me.  If you've played the original, I don't recommend buying Genma unless you are a completist.  It definitely makes for a good rental, just to see all the changes.  If you've never played the original, this might be a good buy for you.  The game can be finished in a day or two the first time around and then within just a few hours each time you come back.  And you will come back.  I did.", "date": "Jan 31, 2002"}
