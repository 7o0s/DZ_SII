All that simulation stuff is great for the PC, but for the smallest screen and gamers that want to nab a little entertainment in stolen moments, it just wasn't a proper fit. SimCity Societies remedies most of the stuff that kept gamers at arm's length from SimCity, introducing easier-to-decipher goals and a simple control mechanism for building up a happy metropolis.   At the start of the game's eight-mission story, you are the newly installed mayor that must turn this pleasant but tiny town into an enviable city. To get from A to B, you must read the currents of the city and please the people with the right combination of buildings and cultural opportunities. At the start of each mission, you have a pretty set goal -- fix the city's electricity problems, solve housing crises, deal with issues surrounding crime, and so on. A nicely explained goal takes a certain amount of guesswork out of the game, but for something that's meant to be consumed ten minutes at a time, it's nice not to be lost in sprawling scenarios.   Much of your time with the game is spent at the controls of an invisible crane. You must build living quarters, job sites, health and safety centers, and cultural landmarks to keep the city ticking. There is a certain balancing act to it all. You need to have enough housing to support incoming citizens that will drop money into your coffers, but unless you have enough places to work, those newly built brownstones will remain empty. When you start each mission, you usually have enough to get the ball rolling with construction, but a lot of time is spent watching the money roll in month after month. Getting enough money to perfect the needed contentment levels isn't exactly difficult, but it may take you a couple tries in later missions to meet your goals, such as a set level of culture or energy.   As mayor, you are in charge not only of buildings, but also dealing with the personal needs of citizens and tending to matters that affect the growth and safety of the city. From time to time, citizens will bring up issues in townhall meetings. You can answer their requests to make them happy, but this often costs cash -- and that's cash you might need to fulfill a mission goal. Declining their needs saves a buck, but it contributes to both the dissatisfaction of citizens (they may move away) and the kind of authority you wield over the city.   SimCity Societies introduces an interesting mechanic -- depending on how you rule over the city and its people, you can build a Utopian paradise or a bastion of absolute authority. The change in leadership affects what kind of buildings you can erect in town. A city under the thumb of a strict mayor will be filled with propaganda centers instead of toy factories. It's not a very deep system, something that would be better fleshed out on another platform, but it works to add some replay to the mobile game. On a second pass-through, you may decide to give into baser instincts and show these little Sims just how iron your iron fist really is.   The simple-to-use menu system in SimCity Societies is fantastic. You move a small cursor over the city and press OK to bring up a radial menu with all available options, such as building types or fast-forwarding the month. The icons are all easy to decipher. This is a great system that other city-building games should definitely check out before erecting their own endeavors.   The game looks good, too. The city is seen from an isometric angle, which allows the artists to give the buildings real depth and extra detail. When citizens call your attention, you get little pictures of a concerned townsperson addressing the mic. All text is easy to read. The music is also solid, adding to the game's pleasing production values.SimCity Societies addresses many of the problems with the original, dense SimCity for mobile. Getting into the swing of being hizzoner by erecting the proper buildings and fielding citizen requests is easy. I really liked the overall flow and pacing of the game -- it's very conducive for mobile. Definitely check it out if you're down with running town.", "date": "Dec 13, 2007"}
