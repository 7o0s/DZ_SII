A few years ago, they released the Magic expansion Ice Age. Unlike previous sets, you were able to play it by itself or as a part of Magic. In EQ, The Ruins of Kunark was sort of like this. A player could spend his entire ~life~ just in the expansion lands without having to return to the Old World.   After Ice Age, Magic would alternate expansions. One would be standalone, while the next wouldn't. EQ did the same. After Kunark came The Scars of Velious that really needed a player to have experience elsewhere in the gameworld before they could venture there.  Now, with EQgoing into its third year of life, The Shadows of Luclin arrives complete with a new race, class, graphics engine, and planet for players to explore. However, it doesn't come without a price.   Let's just get the bad news out of the way first. If you want to play Luclin, you're probably going to need to upgrade your PC a bit. They recommend a minimum of 256MB of RAM, but with that amount you'll only be able to load up half of the new character models. If you want the best performance out of the game, you'll need 512MB RAM and, at the very least, a GeForce 2 or compliant card.   Yes, that is a steep upgrade from the core game, and Windows 95 users are now out of luck due to the game requiring Direct X 8.1, but it's all worth it as The Shadows of Luclin is by far the best EverQuest expansion yet and elevates the game to a level where its features can compare even to newly-released MMORPGs.  The story behind the expansion has to do with events deep in Norrath's past, specifically the continent of Odus. Long in the past a race of cat people related to the Kerrans lived there. They were known as the Vah Shir and as a result of the experiment that created the dungeon The Hole, they were catapulted onto Norrath's moon, Luclin.  However, their history books aren't that good so they don't know the complete story of how they got on the moon. Over the years, the race has flourished and has a strong empire that is in good standing with most races of Norrath. Think of them as the polar opposite of the Iksar from Kunark and you have a good idea of their culture and society.  The Vah Shir are a large race that can be Warriors, Rogues, Shaman, Bards, and the newest class, the Beastlord. These masters of taming creatures are a Warrior/Shaman/Monk hybrid. They can only wear up to leather, have Shaman spells, monk-like hand to hand combat abilities, and a pet that stays with them throughout their life. Every race in the game that can be a Shaman can be a Beastlord, which means Barbarians, Trolls, Ogres, and even Iksar will be seen with warders in the game. However, each race gets a different type of pet. Vah Shir have a tiger, Barbarians a wolf, Trolls receive a gator, Ogres train bears, and the Iksar fight with Scaled Wolves.  Their pets can now zone and camp with you, so you no longer have to recast them every time you change an area or log back into the game.   Instead of getting a new pet spell at every spell level, the Beastlord companion is actually an ability. When a player summons their animal, they then use a spell to buff it up to a level closer to your current one. The pets start out life small, but as you grow in levels they will grow in size.  Another big change to the gameplay this time around is the much-hyped Alternated Advancement for post-50 characters. By choosing this option on the inventory screen, players can choose to set aside some of their experience that they gain post-level 50 to use towards many special abilities, some of which are class-specific. This gives players toward the endgame even more options to prevent them from becoming bored at those high levels.  Characters aren't the only things that benefit from this expansion, as zones themselves have new gameplay elements that really make this the best expansion yet. One example is a zone on Luclin called Hollowshade Moor.  In this zone there are three different races vying for power. Players can determine who becomes the dominant race by triggering certain events that will cause a rare spawn to appear. Take out that rare spawn, and the population of the zone will change to reflect what race is the dominant one. This works slightly similar to the 10th Ring quest in Velious for those EQveterans out there.  Some zones even have NPC interaction where players will fight alongside an NPC in an on-going quest that will eventually require a full guild of level 50's to complete. One of these takes place in the Grimling Forest zone where you go from Grimling camp to Grimling camp with a Vah Shir NPC while protecting him and killing mobs along the way. The tasks get harder and harder until only a full guild will be able to complete the final epic conclusion to the quest. Those players who were worried about there not being enough raid material can rest easy now.  There are also more dynamic and traps inside dungeons that give players a better sense that they are playing a roleplaying game and not just camping mobs over and over. A good example can be found deep inside the Grimling city in the Acrylia Mines. As the party ventures out onto a platform, they spring an unavoidable trap that ensnares their feet. This triggers wave after wave of level 40+ skeletons that they must fight before they encounter the boss of the area and complete yet another huge and involving quest.  With those big improvements spoken for, the next thing on the list is the new graphics engine. Anyone who has seen EverQuest can easily tell that it was made back in the day when the Voodoo 2 was the ultimate in PC graphics cards, and the game is seriously showing its age, especially compared to recent MMORPGs.  To solve this, they have given the Old World and both previous expansions a complete texture overhaul to give it all a nice, high-res look, and I must admit to being impressed at the quality of these new textures.  Obviously the most noticeable upgrade is in the character models in which every race gets a new model for both male and female versions. These are high poly creations that have actual skeletal and musculature features in order to give facial expressions to the many social animations that are in the game. Characters now drop their jaw in awe (or terror) and laugh with a mouth full of teeth showing.  Armor is no longer just a texture, but rather can move and flow as a character runs. Characters can customize their hair, eye, and beard colors in addition to selecting multiple styles of faces.   Some of the models look great. I love the new Iksar, Dark Elves, Ogres, Barbarians, and of course the Vah Shir, but I'm not too fond of the new Troll and Halfling models. Thankfully, you can choose what ones show up, but you cannot see an old model on the horses.  Oh yes, the horses. That's the other big addition to Luclin. Unlike Dark Age of Camelot where you just ride a horse from one destination to another, in Luclin you can control where you go and summon the horse whenever you are outdoors; once you fork out the platinum that is needed for the bridle (about 10,000 to 100,000 depending on your charisma). However, once you have your steed you can run anywhere as fast as Journeyman Boots to the speed of Spirit of Cheetah, depending on how expensive the horse was. Also, both Paladins and Shadow Knights can receive holy or unholy steeds.  Even though the price of playing is high due to some upgrades, Luclin is the best of the three EverQuest expansions. The dynamic zone mechanics in the game are excellent and truly breathe new life into a nearly three-year-old game and that is exactly the job of an expansion. Playing as a Beastlord is quite a bit of fun, and any EQaddiction will be completely renewed by this expansion.  -- Jeremy Conrad      Want to share your opinions with the world?
