Sure, control is important, but the game needs to be moving to get me really going. If you're not bookin', you're truckin', and truckin' hasn't been fun since Penn and Teller intentionally proved that slow moving driving is death by the highway mile.  V-Rally 2 Presented by Need for Speed has speed puffing out of its tail pipe. Whether you're racing against three other highly-detailed rally cars, or splitting the screen four-ways to take on three of your friends, or even when you're all alone on the rally track at night in torrential rain, the game rushes like a getaway driver. That's all complemented by a powerful and realistic physics engine and a graphic design that is sharp and captures the sport's international flair. Gameplay  V-Rally 2 Presented by Need for Speed is much like its predecessor as well as Sega Rally or any other rally racer in that it tries to appeal to both sim and arcade fans and racing game enthusiasts at the same time. There is an arcade mode where you race straight out against a field of competitors, or you can try digging deeper into the options to get a more accurate racing experience.  For the arcade fans, there is quite a bit to like here. Races take place in one of 12 countries spanning the globe, from the mountainous ranges of Italy to sunny stretches in Monte Carlo. Choose your rally racer (from a selection of a whopping 16 European licensed cars, including a few that you've never seen on this side of the pond), then tear up the asphalt and skid through the mud in a heated circuit through the game's 84 (yes, eighty-four) tracks. Oh, gee -- You wanted 90 tracks? Then build some more in the game's track editor mode, which enables you to choose elevation, turn curvature, lap or linear race design, nation of the course setting, and even weather condition (within limits -- you can't drop a blanket of snow on Indonesia, for instance, but you can bring on a small monsoon if you so desire to torment the locals for the sake of good racing).  Racing enthusiasts will take to the game just as well. As I said before, the game moves with the quickness, but the car control is still always responsive and natural. Surfaces have different traction textures, so power slides work much differently on asphalt or snow or gravel. Cars feel weighty, and don't slide out of control like they do in Rally Cross or Test Drive: Off Road 3. Shifting is a critical skill, although you can race with an automatic if you just want to hold down the accelerator (the game does not, however, support analog acceleration on the Dual Shock -- just analog control). Cars grip the road when they need to, and corner realistically on their shocks (you can adjust the body's height to really see how the car handles, as it rides almost a foot off its tires and shimmies at every curve).   Your navigator gives instructions for curves and suggestions for speed, which helps at times if you've turned off the display, but the game's occasional pop-in is drawn far enough out in the distance that you'll be fine relying on your own skills and knowledge of the track. Just be careful, as the AI is aggressive and skilled, so while all-out speed will get you a ways in the arcade mode, you'll see yourself dropping further and further in the standings if you crash or spin out much.  It's the sim fans that will find this game less than perfect, although it still will hold a lot of appeal for them. Once outside of the arcade mode, the game takes on more realistic aspects of the sport -- you'll race for time rather than against competitors, and you'll have to constantly adjust aspects of your car to best suit the track. The problem is that the game is still rather arcade-like when it's trying to be realistic. Many tracks are still just tunnels with invisible walls (a limitation of many racing games, in fact), and the walls come very close to the edge of the track in many cases. You won't slide off the course and drop out of the lead because, outside of the graphics, there is no such thing as being off-course.   Your car can take damage now that you're getting into the sim aspects, a cool extra that was introduced in Need for Speed High Stakes. Damage isn't just cosmetic either, in fact the championship mode tracks damage to the chassis, gear box, brakes, steering column, and suspension, and each of these aspects weighs pretty heavily in a time trial. But despite my hardest attempts to destroy my Hyundai Coupe, it still could get up to 40 MPH in a straight-away. I even threw it into reverse at 85 MPH, which should have dropped the gear box off on the side of the road, but that violent mistake simply added some damage to the gear box without any grand consequence. In other words, it's a good addition, but it's far more forgiving than real life.  For technical addicts, some of the game's smaller flaws show up in the strangest ways. First, the options almost always reset themselves, which is maddening. Damage fully repairs itself after a circuit, so if you take your pile out after a particularly grueling tour of Portugal, you find yourself with a brand new car to race with in Argentina (despite your last-place finish in the previous circuit).   Some of the car settings reset themselves as well after every race. Technically, the car should be reconfigured every time you go out on a new course, but if you find that the next race has the same conditions as the previous race, and once you're used to the feel of that particular car set-up, you'd like to just click away and get into the race. Unfortunately, you may find yourself getting a bit of a surprise, as the car is configured completely wrong for that particular track, and even after resetting the settings, you may find yourself out of ~the zone~ by the time you get on the track. All these are nit-picky things for such a fun and fast racer, but this is a nit-picky crowd, and the game would have been even more fun if those elements had been simulated correctly  Graphics  Zoomin'. The game is fast, no matter how many ways you split the screen. This game makes the most of its feel for speed, running quicker than even EA's own Need for Speed series. The sensation is accented more by the various camera angles, which put you as close to the action as you wish (just try the in-car cam for a real racing rush). Framerate is never a problem, and even four-player battles are smooth and swift, with only a minimal loss of detail in the cars and environments.  You'd think that all this speed would overload the system and make for an ugly game, but that's about as far from the truth as possible. While not as clearly beautiful and diverse as Gran Turismo, V-Rally 2 does some tricks that even Polyphony Digital's upcoming masterpiece can't do. Vehicles are so detailed and accurate that they feature see-through windows, where you can look in on the driver, the navigator, and the spare tire in back. (However, the in-game camera mode doesn't feature an animated driver handling the wheel as in Sega's Super GT, so you won't see much of the driver in a real race). Cars are shiny and spectacularly detailed, with models that are accurate from the spoiler to the headlights. As a clever touch, license plates carry the name of the player racing, so (in four-player mode) you know which one of your friends you are bumping off the road.   Track textures are of equal quality. International locales feature natural environments without the landmarks that try to scream ~Hey, you're in France!~ Indonesian seaside towns feature thatched-roof houses and throngs of spectators, while English countrysides have a more relaxed, less busy feel, with gently rolling hills passing through the farm lands. Snow and rain effects, while minimal, are very good -- rain looks like it's rushing at an angle when you're really moving. The tracks feature all kinds of terrain, each of which affects performance as well as visual appeal. You'll know to let up a bit as you cruise from packed dirt to gravel, and to go all out once you hit pavement. And when you race all alone in a time trial, the game adds some extra detail features, such as people running across the track.  But there are some issues here, chief of which is the limiting design of the tracks. The invisible walls reign you in pretty tightly, and the off-road nature of the game is lost some when all there is to the game is the road. You can crash into houses or rub up against fences, but you can't ever crash through and go exploring. This hurts the realism, as walls are placed exactly where you were hoping they weren't. Also, the brilliant graphics are hurt some by pop-in and some resolution qualms. The graphics look very good moving, but opponent cars can look pixilated sometimes as you bear down on them. There are also some severe clipping troubles, as you will see cars pass halfway through each other and roadside detail pop in and out of a car on the road. The finishing line cinematic is especially problematic, as the pillars that surround the winner's podium sometimes disappear as the camera circles the car. And finally, some of the trackside details do not affect the car as they should. Pits in the road are just there for show, and cars pass through trees like nothing. These issues don't do much to burden the racing experience, but they do hurt the realism that this game aspires to in an otherwise stunning graphic presentation. Sound Again, very good, with some issues here and there. The music tracks are all stylish euro-pop tunes, with some very interesting bizarre choices here and there (such as the Ramstein-like German chorus or the smooth groove behind the menu screens) that don't do much for the international atmosphere but do raise the blood level quite a bit.    Car sounds are your typical ~Vroom vroom,~ which is to be expected, and they do falter here and there (a car can go from red limit to nothing without a winding out sound, but most racing games have this same problem). Crashes aren't that wicked in the audio (though they're awesome visually), and scrapes sound pretty minor. The V-Rally team did do some wonders with the audio on the cars -- cars don't sound that throaty, but they all sound different. There are also nice details in the audio that really add to the experience. Moving the camera into the car brings you closer to the engine, so you'll hear the engine noise better. One of my favorite details is that if you flip your car, the crowd will cheer like a bunch of sadistic buffoons. Unfortunately, the navigator (who's sitting right next to you) sounds like he's on a bad phone connection, so you'll have a hard time understanding what the heck he's saying even with all the music and sound effects turned down low. Even so, the audio performs best as it can. It's just not as outstanding as the graphics.Eden Studios, Infogrames, EA, and the Need for Speed team deserve quite a bit of credit for making such a full-on speedy racer here. Rally games have a lot of variables to deal with, including terrain types, vehicle model designs, roadside detail, and car handling and auto physics (including crash control), so to do all of that well and still be faster than all get-out is pretty stunning. Only hard-core sim fans will be let down by the game, but if it's a race you want, you'll find one here worth your time.", "date": "Dec 3, 1999"}
