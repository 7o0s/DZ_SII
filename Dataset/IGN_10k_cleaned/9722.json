The chief concern is that the blockbuster music game traffics in the currency of fantasy fulfillment. You stand in your living room with a plastic guitar plinking along with on-screen notes, but in the front of your mind, you are a rock star standing on-stage before 70,000 screaming fans at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. That's simply just not possible with the mobile game since, well, your phone looks nothing like a guitar.   (But if it does, please tell me how you modded it.)   However, being told ~no~ seems to inspire developer MachineWorks Northwest to try harder and their mobile edition of Guitar Hero is a very clever approximation of the console game. It's not perfect -- there are a handful of issues that keep it from going into low orbit. But it works very well within the boundaries of mobile games, or as I like to call them: opportunity walls. Megafans of the console game will turn their nose up no matter what, and in many respects, I understand. But for people that have heard of the Guitar hero phenomenon and may not own a video game console or wish to invest nearly $100 in the Guitar Hero III set-up, Guitar Hero Mobile is a suitable alternative.   The most noticeable difference to the actual game is the decision to drop two frets. No matter what difficulty you choose when playing Guitar Hero Mobile, you only have three buttons to worry about. The speed of the notes is what ratchets up to match the ascending difficulty, and on hard, there are a few tricky riffs that might trip you up. But , on the whole, Guitar Hero Mobile is an easier game than the console edition.   Now, that's not a slam. That is a conscious design choice for the medium and it makes complete sense. Instead of trying to wrap the frets around the number pad, like Gameloft does in its Guitar Legend game, MachineWorks maps the three frets to a very manageable row of numbers, such as 7 through 9. Once you hit enough blue notes to achieve the score-multiplying Star Power, activate it by pressing the * button. By limiting the frets, Guitar Hero Mobile is now wholly accessible to anybody with even a passing curiosity.   Should they make the download, which will soon be available on BREW handsets (Verizon Wireless) with other carriers to follow, gamers should be pleasantly surprised. (This review zeroes in solely on the BREW version, which is capable of MP3-wuality audio and 3D graphics. When other edition launch, such as those that use MIDI sounds, I will revisit the game.) The game uses licensed tracks from the current of previous Guitar Hero games, such as ~Even Flow~ by Pearl Jam and ~Suck My Kiss~ from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The songs are only about two minutes in length, but the quality is outstanding. I tested the game on an LG VX9400 and was very pleasantly surprised by the richness of the audio. I could understand every work in Santana's ~Black Magic Woman.~   Depending on the phone, players can some very cool effects when playing a song. On the 9400, for example, pieces of the track fall away if you botch notes. This is amazing, considering we still have many games that play either music or sound effects. It's a real credit to MachineWorks' coding skills.   So, what doesn't work as well? Getting songs. While testing the final version of the game, I found downloading tracks very finicky. The initial download comes with one song already fully downloaded. To get another song, you have to pull it off the server. There is no extra change for this, mind you -- it's included in the download cost of the game. This can take some time and require diligent attention. Getting ~Suck My Kiss~ took several attempts. You have to hover over the screen and hit OK every once in a while so the game doesn't automatically time you out. So, once I realized I needed to glue myself to the phone (but not actually be playing the game), there were just a few more time-outs before the song was fully downloaded. Traditionally, mobile games are about stolen moments, and the idea of spending multiple minutes just staring at a download screen isn't exactly conducive to the get-in-get-out mentality.   After I downloaded a song, I also had to completely restart the game to get it to work properly. Every time I chose the song, no music would play and I would just see notes streaming down the screen. I kept restarting the song to see if something would just ~click,~ but only after closing the entire game and rebooting it did the download work properly.   The game looks great and really captures the Guitar Hero atmosphere. MachineWorks paid very close attention to all the trimmings of the console game such as the little ~bwang~ noise made when moving around menus. Players also earn in-game achievements for rocking out, such as opening picks and guitars.  Guitar Hero Mobile is a successful adaptation of Activision's monster hit. Diehard GH fans may not like the fact that the game jettisons two frets, but newcomers or casual fans will certainly appreciate the MP3-quality audio. The game is also a supremely good facsimile of the console game, such as the menu screens and the background rockin' from guitar heroine Judy Nails. The amount of time spent downloading songs might frustrate some players, though, and that's something you should consider. But still, this is the best rhythm game you'll play on your phone this year. Hands-On Mobile and MachineWorks should be commended for figuring out how to make this happen.", "date": "Dec 10, 2007"}
