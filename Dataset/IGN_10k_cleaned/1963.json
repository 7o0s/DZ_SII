On the one hand, it's all about Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, and those girls are all about fun! So, like, they go to the mall, and they hang out at the food court, and they snowboard just like in Cool Boarders-- cool!! And also, they're girls, which means that Mary-Kate and Ashley's game is totally for girls, and that's cool. Girls are totally into games -- get used to it guys! So, it's like, when game makers make games for girls, then more girls play games, and everything's really sweet!  But then, on the two hand, the game is made by those ninnies who made Danger Girl -- um, I don't think those people should be making games for girls after that one, and I definitely don't think they should be making Mary-Kate and Ashley games! And I soo don't think they should be making games at all right now, because they made this game really uncool and also, I'm speaking all Valley because of them. Arrrgh!!!   Sugar and Spice  So, why wouldn't it be cool for games made for girls? Naw, it's totally cool, and that's the good part of this game. Ok, so it's not like all girls like is shopping and going to the mall and junk food and stuff like that -- it's totally that every girl's game is all about that stuff -- but then again, that stuff is pretty cool sometimes, and here, it's all in the same game!   The Olsen twins get to play around in a mall that's has more than just shopping -- it has magical adventure stuff in some stores. So, if you go to the snowboard shop to check out the hottest Tech Vests, instead you'll get magically brought to a snowboard park where you get to go all out in a shredding race! And when you go into a clothes store Fash, suddenly MK&A find themselves strutting down the runway like Tyra in front of millions of people modeling the hottest fashions outside Milan. So awesome!!  Also, what's cool about Magical Mystery Mall is that there are some things that are really neat. For this game, Mary-Kate and Ashley had a contest to pick two boys to star in the game with them, and they really are in the game -- like, all over the place, with their voices and faces and everything... lucky! That's a cool thing to do for the MK&A fans. Plus, in the record store, you get to do a dance video -- Mary-Kate and Ashley get to choreograph all the moves, and then when they're dancing, all these special effects go off, and you get to move the camera around. Right, but what's really cool is that you can take the game out and dance along to your favorite CD -- my favorite song is by Britney Spears!!!   Slugs and Snails What I don't like is boys -- specifically, boys who think girls shouldn't have games that are fun. And specially especially boys who make girl games for girls, but don't think they should spend all their time making girly games, so they don't make them any good and instead work really hard on games with girls with big boobies and just kind of quickly do the ~chick~ game because they think girls won't care! Puuhh-leeease!!! Mary-Kate and Ashley's game is totally going to do better than your bubble-booty girl game, so why not make it really, really, really good?  Nope. Instead, girl gamers get a crappy game that messes up when you're trying to do good, or else it doesn't explain what's supposed to be happening, or else it's just boring. It's like, you're in a mall -- that should rule! But naw, all the shops are closed except for the five that have games in them, so when you end the game and save the day, you can't even go shopping afterwards!  The bad games are really bad, and are pretty tough. When the twins need to serve up food at Lizzie's Lunch, it's like the controller is broken the gameplay is so bad! You keep pressing the button, but unless you're perfectly lined up, it doesn't work. And in the snowboarding game, you always get stuck on things, and it's really frustrating when it should be fun. It's not like this game needs to be SSX or anything, but it should at least work and be fun!  Why do they have to dis on girl gamers by making ooey games like this? There's a lot of fun to be had in this mall, but then the gameplay is sucky, and so are the graphics. Mary-Kate look like the real thing, and the fashions and dances are fun, but the mall itself is all jerky and confusing, and some of the special effects aren't so special. When the game does look good, the control gets in the way. I just wish game makers would watch girls play games when they make their own, because then they would see that what a girl wants is simple -- good gameplay. Then after that, it doesn't hurt to have cool fashions and funky music and two crazy girls...", "date": "Jun 13, 2001"}
