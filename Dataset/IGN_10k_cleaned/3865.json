That sun-soaked Venice Beach sim, celebrating the art of surfing, skating, and hackey sack'ing?  Well, the surfing portion of the game is back, thanks to a loving clone by the name of Cali Surf, which proves the imitation is not just the sincerest form of flattery, but it also provides us with a good game.  Features:  Two surfers: Dude and Chick Four boards Real California surf locales  This isn't going to be a long review. There's a handful of superlatives to hurl at Cali Surf, and very few drawbacks.  Well, none really.  The control is amazingly simple, but it works quite well.  Pressing left or right steers your boarder across the cobalt blue pipe, hopefully getting enough air to pull of a trick, and then position yourself for a proper landing.  Impressively, the waves ebb and swell, so no two rides are the same.  High tide means big air, while a tiny wave requires good speed to bust a trick.  There are a variety of power-ups that affect the performance of your surfer, such as speed and spin power. The more you collect, the better your boarder is -- and the more fun you'll have with the game.  Now, Cali Surf doesn't necessarily push the visuals of your phone to the extreme -- we ran it on a T720 -- but you have to smile at the great color paleete employed, especially during the sunset levels. As the sun rides low in the sky, even the waves reflect the golden goodbye.  Very slick. Flarb's arcade-style surf sim scores a direct hit by offering up a simple, easy-to-play little diversion with good control and some pleasant visuals. Flarb may have shamelessly copied California Games, but when the source material is that strong, good things are bound to happen.", "date": "Aug 27, 2003"}
