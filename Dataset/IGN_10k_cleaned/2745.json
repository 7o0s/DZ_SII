Early games like Mario Kart: Super Circuit and Castlevania: Circle of the Moon show that the system can crank out better quality productions than what was produced on the system back almost a decade ago...and direct ports, like EA's recently released Desert Strike Advance at least show that the system can faithfully reproduce 16-bit console designs on the system.  So what the heck happened with the GBA port of Earthworm Jim 2? Features Nine levels Password save Only for Game Boy Advance   In the sequel designed by Shiny back in the early 90s, the development team pretty much threw traditional design out the window and created a game that was just so crazily wacky that no words could coherently explain just what the heck's going on. The game's still a side-scrolling action game, but its situations are weird for the sake of being weird. Players guide Jim through hazardous terrain like the Planet of Meat, Paperwork or through a living intestinal planet in a blind salamander disguise...that leads up to a game show with players selecting completely wrong answers that are really the right ones. Each situation is stranger than the last, each one featuring stupidly ridiculous hazards and enemies such as cow-abducting aliens, flying penguins, and baby-carrying ants.  Basically, Jim needs to wander through these weird locations, hopping from platform to platform, blasting enemies with his gun or whipping them with his worm body. He can climb ledges, and swing like Tarzan or parachute to safety using the booger dude that's in his backpack. Levels require some thought and technique...like the challenge where you have to carry cows from one location to the barn without getting them abducted. Or the level where you have to keep Peter Puppy's pals bouncing on a giant marshmallow. There are definitely some clever ideas in Earthworm Jim 2.  When done correctly, Earthworm Jim 2 is a solid game and a lot of fun. We've had versions for the Genesis, Super NES, Saturn...and I believe even the PlayStation was going to get the game before Sony turned it down because of its 2D-ness.  So the developer who was assigned the task of bringing the game to the GBA had a lot of reference.  I'm not going to speculate on what happened at the development studio responsible for this shoddy port, but man...Earthworm Jim 2 on the Game Boy Advance is so sloppy it almost waters the eyes watching the game move on the LCD screen. Majesco's first Earthworm Jim effort on the Game Boy Advance, released as a launch title almost exactly a year ago, wasn't perfect, either, but at least it wasn't as unbalanced and bug-filled as this production. Jumping is definitely not as fluid as the original Earthworm Jim 2 on the consoles...his hyper jump/fall animation makes it difficult for players to pull off Jim's important ~booger whip~ move. Enemy sprites and objects seem to glitch all over the place in spots throughout the game. The action tends to slowdown in the most unlikely locations, killing the game's pace...and the gameplay's inconsistent, with some ledges that can be climbed upon, but others, identical in looks, that cannot. The GBA version of Earthworm Jim 2 even dishes out level passwords that either don't work at all, or load a game where you instantly die for no apparent reason. Beta-testing? What's that?  To its credit, the development team managed to get more frames of animation into the sequel than the previous developer did with the original game for the GBA. But that doesn't help when the game moves so inconsistently that it's almost unbearable to watch. The soundtrack has also been sandwiched down into near inaudible muffles, which is unfortunate considering the music translation was one of the highpoints of the original GBA game's development. After the somewhat sloppy (but acceptable) performance of the original Earthworm Jim game on the Game Boy Advance, it's just shocking to see the sequel perform much worse on the handheld. We can understand and almost forgive the problems with the first game on the handheld...the hardware was fresh and new to programmers and publishers. After a year with the Game Boy Advance on the market, we should be moving forward, not backward...the sequel is sloppily produced and bug-filled. It's still playable, but it's extremely difficult to overlook all the game's problems...because there's just so many of them.", "date": "Jun 18, 2002"}
