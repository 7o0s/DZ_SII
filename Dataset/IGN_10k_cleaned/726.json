We need a game. Fast. Got anything for us? Crawfish Designer: Well, we've been kicking around this puzzle idea that's like Lost Vikings, but it's kinda hard to play... Acclaim Executive: Perfect! We'll just have you replace the sprites with Mary-Kate and Ashley. Crawfish Designer: But there's a third character. Acclaim Executive:  Can't you get rid of it? Crawfish Designer: No. The game needs three. Acclaim Executive: Okay, fine. Throw a cute dog in there as well. Crawfish Designer: Who're Mary Kate & Ashley?  Acclaim Executive: I see them on television all the time. They're twins. Bob Saget's kids. You know, Craziest Home Videos or something? Crawfish Designer: No, I don't. Why are these kids in a videogame, anyway? Acclaim Executive: That's your job to figure out. I think they have a series of books. Like this one. [reveals The New Adventures of Mary Kate & Ashley Volume 13]. Crawfish Designer: And...you read that stuff? Acclaim Executive: Um, er...no. They're for my...sister's kids. Yeah. Crawfish Designer: So, what do they do? Acclaim Executive: I dunno, solve crimes or something. Think you can handle it? Crawfish Designer: Well, the game we got can pretty much be tailored for anything. I think we can handle it.  Acclaim Executive: Make sure you put monkeys in there. Kids love the monkeys. Crawfish Designer: I'll get back to you. (ed. note. This encounter is completely fictional, but it sure could have happened...) Features Five adventures Ten levels per adventure Digitized voice Password save For Game Boy or Game Boy Color  You have to hand it to Acclaim for trying to attract a near untouchable market: the young girl gamers. By snagging Mary-Kate & Ashley for a series of videogames, the company hopes to grab a nice piece of the pie that no one really bothered to go for, at least on the Game Boy.  Problem is, all the company is really going for is the name on the box. It doesn't matter what goes into the cartridge  as long as the game features the twins, it's golden.  That's not to say that The Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley on the Game Boy is a bad game  it's not. The problem is, the game is very complex and frustrating to play, even for seasoned gamers like myself.  So what we have is a game that will only appeal to girls,  but the game itself isn't balanced for the market it's going for. No male in his right mind is going to ask his folks to pick him up a copy of this game, simply because of the subject matter. And as far as I can tell, only a few girls are actually going to be able to trod through this complex puzzle game. Way to reach out to your audience, Acclaim.  The game (you're nuts if you think I'm going to type out ~The Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley~ every time) is very much like The Lost Vikings. Each puzzle challenges you to control Mary-Kate, Ashley, and their dog Clue independently, trying to obtain a puzzle piece to solve each of the game's five ~cases.~ Each case is separated in ten levels, each having one puzzle piece to grab. You must have the three work together to flip switches, eliminate hazardous enemies,  and climb high ledges to get the piece of the puzzle. What's more, each character has its own strengths. Mary-Kate, for instance, has a bouncy head (just like in real life, I guess) which enables the other two to jump on her noggin and spring to higher platforms. Ashley can pull switches as well as pick up and throw the dog (huh???) to destroy enemies that would normally put the three out of commission. The dog is small enough to fit in little gaps, and he can carry the two on his head. The puzzle pieces are always hiding behind a closed gate, so you need to figure out how to get Ashley to an activation switch and another to the gate at the same time. You control each character independently, switching back and forth between them by hitting the select button. If any character ~dies~ during the level, you start over until you run out of lives.  You can also get hints to each puzzle by collecting three ~clue~ icons floating in each level. Problem here is, in many cases the clues are harder to get than the puzzle piece, and by the time you get the clues you will have already figured out how to solve the level. And some of the puzzles are just really hard to figure out. The only way you're going to solve some is doing the ol' trial-and-error deal. Sacrifice a few Mary-Kates and Ashleys to see how to get from one ledge to another. Another problem: limited lives. And you only get a password after you solve an entire case.  The only time you're going to realize this is a Mary-Kate & Ashley game is the little bits of digitized images thrown between the rounds. And you'll also hear recorded audio from one of the kids, but it's so garbled that you'll never know which one is talking. The audio is so low quality it sounds like they're talking underwater. And the character sprites  good luck trying to see ANY similarities to the twins. They might as well have been little green elves trying to collect the fruit of the Magical Yum Yum Tree. Look, I'm not going to kid you  this game isn't that bad. I don't expect any of you fine folks to rush down to your local retailer to scarf up a copy of Mary-Kate & Ashley, but I have to make it known that, despite the heavily-focused license, the game underneath is a challenging design. And that's a big problem, especially since the game is made specifically for 12 year old girls. Let me just say this: if the game featured a different, more widely accepted license instead of the Olsen Twins, it would have received the same score I gave it. But I'd be more likely to purchase the title for my own enjoyment.", "date": "Feb 19, 2000"}
