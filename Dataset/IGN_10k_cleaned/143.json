While I can understand the financial logic behind putting a $15 game on a system with an install base ticking upwards of 120 million consoles worldwide, I still feel like the game is going to get shafted -- and hard -- at retail. Aside from a few bits of chatter among the 2D-loving hardcore fans on the 'tubes, Heavenly Guardian has nearly nothing going for it in the way of competition against some of the PS2's last few big titles.    Part of me is crushed that one of the last pure 2D games to hit consoles (2D seems relegated to naught but handhelds and emulation these days) is going to come and go without anyone even knowing it had arrived. Admit it: if you're reading this review, you probably knew about the game beforehand. The other point to make is that the end product is, frankly, pretty damn crappy -- at least from an artistic standpoint.    I'll get into the bafflingly antiquated situation behind the game's final form in a second. But for all six of you out there who still remember Pocky & Rocky, the awesome SNES shooter released by Natsume, and had heard that Heavenly Guardian would be a proper sequel, it's not. In truth, that's probably a good thing, as it keeps the Pocky & Rocky game (which I played recently for a refresher heading into this review) a true old-school gem without tarnishing the name. The short story is that Guardian developer Starfish lost the license to P & R a while after Taito (the creator of the series) was gobbled up by Square Enix.    What would have been Pocky & Rocky 2 was axed, and what can only be assumed to be a rushed fill-in product was quickly cobbled together from the previous game's assets. I won't presume to know what happened during the development process to get the game to its current state, but the bottom line is that state is ocular garbage. I'm all for a developer having the balls to put out a straight 2D game without having to resort to using 3D effects on top, but there's no getting around the fact that Heavenly Guardian is a visual pile.    To say that this looks like a SNES game is doing a great injustice to most SNES games -- games that are well over a decade old at their earliest and are a full two generations behind now. It looks like crap. The sprites aren't well animated, nor are they particularly high-res (though at least the game does allow for hundreds of them on the screen at a time). There are some moments of ~what the hell is this nonsense~ hilarity when you see what looks like a granny in a demon wheelchair wreathed in flame scream toward you, but for the most part a lot of what could have been a charming take on feudal Japan is lost on just how archaic the game looks.    A humble house in the mountains. It's similarly simple in actual gameplay too, meaning simple patterned boss fights and levels that are touted to be open and non-linear but really just offer multiple paths to the same goal. I'm not saying the effort to add little hidden-away sections with bonuses isn't a good thing, but frankly, there'd better be more than a straight Point A/Point B path in a 2D game these days.    Luckily, the game's shooter roots from Pocky & Rocky, simple as they are, were more or less copied part and parcel from the earlier games. That means you can run in any direction and shoot in that direction, though can't do both at the same time. With the advent of two analog sticks and the proliferation of twin stick shooters in recent years, it's a little crippling to go back to just shooting where you're moving, but I'm a sap for some of the older ways we used to play games.   There are a couple of core mechanics that keep the game from being an absolute mindless button mashfest, though. The different types of weapons from the previous games have returned, now with upgrades if you collect gems of a specific color/type (read: homing, 3-way, bomb, rapid fire, etc.). Collect multiples of the same color to power it up and you'll be able to grab another type of weapon while keeping the upgrade power intact.      It's an interesting strategy because if you're judicious with your pick-ups, you can end up with a rather powerful version of a given weapon, but that doesn't necessarily mean it'll be the best weapon for that level or the boss at the end, nor does it mean that finding a few like-colored upgrade gems early on will continue later on into the level. It offers a basic sense of strategy, I suppose, and for what it's worth, it kept me interested all the way through a stage -- purely on a, ~oh, crap, should I go for this new weapon type or try to find more of the one I have first?~ level.   There's one other bit of strategy to the game. That right stick that probably could have been used for 360 degree firing is instead reserved for summoning a snowstorm that can freeze all enemies in that direction (or rather, the 8-way approximation of it, which can actually lead to misfires, though if you want precision a face button can be used instead to whip up a storm in the direction you're facing). Frozen enemies are encased in ice and when one block of ice is shattered, the rest explode with them, giving a chain bonus for points which count toward a high score and end-level tally, but nothing else. Retro, that. As an aside, the little bunny-ish familiar that you have tagging along with you will instantly freeze an enemy if it makes contact, which can lead to some simple combos if that's your bag.     And so you'll leisurely stroll from one ancient Japanese locale to the next (apparently to gather materials from bosses to make a potion that will heal an ailing child in a village that was kind to one of the normally shunned spirits that makes up the main character), shooting enemies, collecting power-ups and fighting bosses. Though it's not really used except for the last few levels and in boss fights, tapping a shoulder button will also let you roll into a snowball to cover a small distance while invincible (really the only way to avoid some attacks).    Of special note is the game's audio, which is quite possibly the most ancient of all the bits. The sound effects were likely culled from old SNES/Genesis libraries, resulting in not only a weird sense of dj-vu, but an incredibly low-fi aural experience. The music is a little better, but only a little, and aside from helping plant the game in Feudal Japan, it really does nothing to stir the interest of the listener.    Fancy shootin'. Heavenly Guardian is an affront to everything that games are now and were back in the day. It can be held up as a brazen defiance of the march of technology, a testament to when games were simple but fun (and despite all my bitching, Heavenly Guardian is still fun... to a degree). It's also a painfully generic, downright pitiful display of what 2D gaming can still offer. I don't mind old-school games, though I do feel that nostalgia often tints our perspective on really old titles until we see them with modern eyes, but that isn't the case here. I wanted a spiritual successor to Pocky & Rocky -- even if the name wasn't there. Instead, I got a game apparently transplanted from the early 90s that was stripped of its soul during the trip. There's no heart to what's happening, only a tired series of canned patterns and lifeless trudges through wintery wastes. This is not the 16-bit throwback you're looking for.", "date": "Apr 8, 2008"}
