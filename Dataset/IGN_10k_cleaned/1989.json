The genre has always seemed to receive an ambivalent reaction in this sector of the market, after all.  Two of the greatest adventures ever were actually console exclusives -- Hideo Kojima's Snatcher and Policenauts -- but hardly anyone played those, and right when they were supposed to be getting the genre some respect, a fistful of horrible FMV-driven games were busy killing it.  Escape from Monkey Island represents the kind of game that could bring it back.  Though it was touched rather lightly by the famous staff that worked on most of the classic Lucasarts adventure games, it carries on their spirit of clever humor and puzzle design, going back through the Silver Age of Full Throttle and Sam and Max to the true Golden Age driven by Sierra and Infocom.  Personally, I was a Golden Age veteran, playing lots of Space Quest, King's Quest, and text adventures before the upgrade curve beat me, so it's great to be able to get into a Lucasarts game now, with no bugs or installs or hardware constraints to dither about.  Monkey Island has, in fact, made it to PS2 almost entirely intact -- in fact, with extras in tow.  If you have the console, there's no reason to favor the PC version, and if you've ever enjoyed a good adventure or a good laugh, there's no reason to pass this game up at all.  Do your part to support your local Mighty Pirate.  Gameplay  The particular Mighty Pirate in question is Guybrush Threepwood, home from his honeymoon with the lovely Elaine Marley after surviving his third encounter with evil Captain LeChuck.  A more dangerous enemy reveals itself after he makes landfall, though: Australian real-estate speculators are buying up property throughout the Tri-Island Area, with the aim of turning a scurvy pirates' den into a safe, friendly vacation destination.  To that end, they've declared Elaine dead, slated her family mansion for demolition, framed Guybrush for bank robbery, put half of Melee Island out of business, and that's just the beginning.   EFMI breaks from the hand-drawn tradition of its predecessors, and also eschews the traditional point-and-click interface, but it won't present any control problems to console gamers.  In fact, the new controls might make it more pad-friendly.  You move with the left analog stick and scroll through the various automatic action options with the right, so it's possible to move and act at the same time.  The face buttons include shorthand for using and picking up objects, and the inventory screen (available with a touch of the L2 button) lets you sort through them easily.  The only hindrance to effortless exploration and puzzle-solving are load times, and they're never much longer than a few seconds.  Transitions between areas and into the inventory pass in a longish blink of an eye.  Sometimes, loads for speech and animation result in a little animation glitching, but that's nothing to moan about, and FMV cutscenes are rare enough that you're never going to have to stop too long to see them.  Once you're acclimated to the pace of the game, it's off to solve the many puzzles it presents, which should be great fun for veterans and beginners alike.  EFMI has a great puzzle design philosophy behind it, integrating its challenges with the characters, the environment, and the items you collect.  There are no Fear Effect-style arbitrary brain-teasers -- this is puzzle design the way it used to be.  The solutions you come up with are frequently very funny, too (just like more or less everything else in the game).  Knocking out the demolition catapult, your first task, delivers a chuckle worthy of one of the great Infocom puzzles (not quite Babel Fish territory, but definitely up there with the Chicago bedroom puzzle in Leather Goddesses of Phobos).  Graphics  Like I said above, Monkey Island is no-longer sprite-based -- we now have Resident Monkey, with 3D characters and pre-rendered backgrounds.  The characters have the same off-kilter cartoon style, but they necessarily lose a little bit of emotional expressiveness.  There are nuances that you just can't convey with polygons yet, unfortunately, although Lucasarts' animators put forth an excellent effort bringing the character designs into 3D.  As far as visual quality goes, there's nothing to complain about here, save for that brief chopping effect caused by the sound loading now and again.  The game looks as good as it would on an expensive PC system, although this never was intended to be a big-deal 3D card showcase.  Everything is displayed in crisp high resolution, and the animation is quite satisfactory.  Sound  Here we come upon one of Monkey Island's strongest points: it has some of the best music and voice acting I've ever heard in a game.  The cast, which I gather shares some names with TV's King of the Hill, delivers the dialogue with the timing and tone that has to be there to make it funny.  Every line in the game is voiced, from Guybrush's false bravado down to the one-off asides of the smallest supporting character, and nearly every one will at least draw a bit of a smile.  Escape from Monkey Island is a very funny game.  More than that, it represents a breed of humor that you have to actively seek out these days: good clean wit, without any reliance on bad taste as a crutch to make up for lack of creativity.  Now that comedy has gotten so relentlessly blue on TV and in the movies, it's marvelously refreshing to find something you can laugh at without feeling ashamed afterwards.  Monkey Island does head below the belt on the odd occasion, but always in a light, chuckling sort of way, as an accent to what's fundamentally an all-ages affair.  The writing and acting are the core of the game's personality, but the music deserves mention as well.  It's a very light score, to the point where you don't quite notice it at times, but it provides an important backdrop to both tense moments and leisurely stretches of wandering around.  Few games actually integrate background music this well into the experience, but they're almost always far better for it, and Monkey Island is no exception. As always, there are some gamers out there who seem to be allergic to this genre.  They will find the usual issues to complain about in Escape from Monkey Island, whether they be the difficulty of the puzzles (although I didn't find it particularly stiff) or the pace of conversation (there, I will agree that some chats with NPCs can wear just a little).But anybody who liked a good adventure game once or thinks they might like to try one out will find a great experience in Monkey Island -- we should count ourselves lucky that this one made it to a console, especially since Lucasarts has thrown in a new art gallery, new mini-games, and a few other extras for the PlayStation 2 version.  It looks good, it's easy to control, it has classic puzzles, and more than anything, it's a heck of a laugh.  All that, and monkeys to boot.", "date": "Jun 20, 2001"}
