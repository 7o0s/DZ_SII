The developer pioneered the For Prizes line-up, unleashing incredible hits like Ms. Pac-Man for Prizes and Tetris Tournament for Prizes. Their games draw players in with the promise of winning gift certificates, but keep their fingers jamming by only turning sure-fire concepts into bona fide For Prizes games. Its latest is a tournament-style take on America's favorite game show, Wheel of Fortune for Prizes. While it is not the strongest offering in their catalog, the license and fairly clever gameplay is surely enough to hook a lot of players.   Wheel of Fortune for Prizes will be familiar to any fan of the show. The trademark wheel, the turning letters, the bankrupt sound -- all present and accounted for. However, Atlas had to make a few changes to keep the game moving along in a tournament structure. For example, you cannot just sit there and hem and haw over the puzzle. The entire game cannot last longer than five minutes, and an on-screen clock is always ticking down. To complete the game, you must work through two regular puzzles and a final puzzle (where they already select S, T, R, N, L and E for you).   And not only do you have a time limit, but you have only five turns to complete each puzzle. As long as you are on a roll with guessing letters or buying vowels, you remain on the same turn. Hit ~lost a turn~ or ~Bankrupt~ on the wheel, though, and you're down a turn. Guess an incorrect letter and you lose a turn. Those five turns can go by pretty fast, so keep an eye on that while playing.   One of Wheel of Fortune for Prizes's weaknesses is pretty much unavoidable -- it's a built-in weakness to the television show. The show has been on so long that the puzzles are now starting to get a little far-fetched. For example, the category for one of our puzzles was ~event.~ When you think of an event, you think of things like a wedding or graduation, right? When in your life has ~making an orchid lei~ ever been an event? That's a distraction or maybe a hobby. Technically, according to Webster, it indeed qualifies as an event, but that's really stretching it.   Wheel of Fortune for Prizes's presentation is good. The text is very readable and choosing letters with the number pad is a snap. The wheel has it's own special screen where you choose the power you want to spin it with. You can really pull ahead if you manage to land on the jackpot wedge of the wheel -- making it damn near impossible for your opponent to beat you that round. Fortunately, the jackpot resets and you must build it back up through repeat play.   The tournament-style of Wheel of Fortune for Prizes works. Most of your play will be head-to-head. If you win enough in a day or week, you will receive a text message letting you know how to claim your prize. There are progressive tournaments, too. Do yourself a favor, though, and run a few practice puzzles before wading on-line. Wheel of Fortune for Prizes is hardly a bad game -- but it's just not the most compelling in the library of Atlas' tournament games. Some of the puzzles are obtuse to the point of irritating and while I understand needing to limit puzzles to five turns, it seems the wheel lands on ~lose a turn~ and ~bankrupt~ a lot. Nevermind that on some of the more ~unique~ puzzles (such as ~orchid lei~), you'll burn through a few turns if you stick if tried-and-true Wheel strategies like picking S or T. However, I know that for fans, the game will be irresistable. They may find more enjoyment than I did. Me? I'll be sticking to Ms. Pac-Man for Prizes, thank you.", "date": "May 3, 2005"}
