And yet, less than 12 months later, Tony Hawk Pro Skater has captured the pure grit and radical feel of skateboarding, delivering it in near perfect form onto the PlayStation with a mastery and sense of programming finesse beyond anyone's imagination.  Tony Hawk Pro Skater is that rare gem of a game that defies what other developers say can't be done. In the ~last~ real year of the PlayStation, Neversoft has created a fantastic engine that enables players to do everything possible in skateboarding. Players can jump, race, trick and fall off any surface in the game -- you name it -- with room to pull off tricks, jump into secret areas, and grab bonuses and prizes as a reward for their skills. You can perform more than a half dozen amazing feats of athleticism in a single jump, lifting up more than 20 feet into air and landing on your skateboard to do it again, or by hurling yourself off a 30-foot jump and landing dangerously on your back. Then you simply dust yourself off and do it again. It's a highly imaginative, deep, and amazingly addictive game that no PlayStation owner, or any system owner for that matter, should be without.  Gameplay This is what it's really all about. Players can race or pull off tricks to their heart's desire in several different modes, whether they love to free skate, compete, or unlock secrets.   As with the best part of snowboarding games, in Tony Hawk, players can simply goof off by going to Free Skate mode. In this level, skaters have no time limits, no restrictions, not scores, and no cops. This is really the heart of the game. With extraordinarily well thought out levels, players can skate in high schools, parks, malls, warehouses, streets, and skate parks, and pull off amazing stunts effortlessly. But what ups the ante with Tony Hawk over the other skateboarding game on PS is that while pulling off tricks is relatively easy, earning points requires you to put those skills to use and improve. What makes this game good for both newbies and hardcore gamers is that the learning curve is steady and consistent and rewards those who learn new how to play the game.  Players can choose to play through several different modes. Free skate should speak for itself. It's a no hassle, free style set of courses to play around in. Career mode is where the competitors go, when they're ready to earn new secret levels, skaters, and bonuses. Here, you'll need to perform varying tricks, depending on the course, to open up new courses and enter into contests. In each level, players can find five letters, spelling out SKATE, and find numerous videocassette tapes hidden in well-placed or specialized areas, such as lunch benches to grind on. The more tapes you have the more levels you open. The more levels you open, the more points you earn, and the more competitions you can enter. In contests, players get points for combos and special moves, and have points subtracted for bails (i.e. falls). After three tries, points are accumulated and tallied. Whoever places in the top slots places earns awards, gold, silver, and bronze, and has the chance to repeat the session if desired. Also choosable are Single Session and two player games.   Courses Still, if you just want to free skate, the levels are like wonder parks. In fact, they're better than the skate parks I frequented in Southern California when I was a kid (Skatopia, The Endless Wave, The Concrete Wave, The Snake, etc.). Little ramps lead to smoothly transitioned walls to grindable benches, hand rails, gymnastic horse bars, garbage cans, mall art, escalators, whatever. Whatever you can see, you can grind on. Neversoft delivered just what a skater wants. The high school has multiple levels from which you can jump off a third story to another roof or to a secret ramp to a fourth second-level bonus area, complete with bonus points. On the roof, players can opt to simply pull off moves, or select to crash through the roof into the gymnasium, whereupon they can skate up into the basketball hoop for extra points. Sound crazy? That's really just the beginning.   Whether you like street or trick skating, this game has it covered. Most of the levels are cyclical, enabling you to circle around to the beginning again, such as Downtown: Minneapolis, Miami and Woodland Hills. Occasionally, however, players will land upon other far more interesting courses, such as Mall: New York. The Mall is sheer brilliance. Players skate down three flights of ramps to a main floor, which is off limits, and immediately they smash through a giant glass window.  From there they can skate up at least two different escalators to information boards and smash them (it's actually a goal to smash five of them), jump across and through water fountains, grind on public art, pull off tricks on demo contest cars, stair cases, and more. Essentially, you've provoked to cause havoc and destroy property, something that I personally love to do in a videogame.   Controls Tony Hawk is set up for players to take on the controller with little learning time and maximum flexibility. Pulling off stunts is easy, but as I said, mastering the big combos takes skill. This is where the individual players come in. Each skater has a set of characteristics, such as Ollie, Speed, Air, and Balance, which determine how good they'll be at certain moves. Some are more apt to be vertical skaters, while others are street skaters. The Vert skaters are Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Rune Glifberg, and Bucky Lasek. The street skaters are Chad Muska, Kareem Campbell, Andrew Reynolds, Jamie Thomas, Geoff Rowley, and the only female in the game, Elissa Steamer.   Thankfully, the controls are some of the most intuitive and natural ones for this kind of game I've seen. Players use all four of the Triangle, Circle, Square, and X buttons in conjunction with the d-pad buttons.   Triangle -- Grind  Square -- Kick Trick X -- Crouch and grab Circle -- Grab Trick Left -- Turn/Balance (while grinding)  Right -- Turn/Balance (while grinding)  Up -- Lean forward, exit pool Down -- Brake/lean back   With just a few button combinations, players can pull off amazing tricks. For instance, Kareem Campbell, a regular-footed street skater, was born in New York with a mean ollie and amazing balance. Kareem has three special moves that only require three buttons to be pressed in sequence. (It's actually a little harder than that, but...) Get a good amount of air, and pull off the Front Flip (Up, Up, Circle), the Casper Slide (Up, Down, Triangle), or the Kickflip, Underflip (left, right, square). Each time you pull any of these off without falling off the points come reeling in.  Graphics Though the graphics in Tony Hawk aren't the most gorgeous textures and models I've ever seen, what the game lacks in pretty colors and specialized textures, it makes up in technical achievements. The developers are actually boasting through much of the game by showing realtime FMV scenes of real bands playing on outdoor movie screens during gameplay, as if to say, ~Check out these tricks, boys.~ But the FMV aside, the huge, multi-tier levels are astounding in the their complexity, design, and size.   The physics aspect of the game is jaw dropping. Technically, it is superb. The engine itself is created for skaters to jump off the curved surface of an S-shaped pool, for example, at any angle into the air and land on perhaps a completely different surface, such as the floor, rail, a wall or a ledge, and continue the momentum, while the character performs a balancing animation to demonstrate the successful landing. The fact that the animations are consistent and clean and that the arenas are free of seams and glitches is shouldn't be amazing, but when you start playing the game, you'll see why it is. Granted, there is only one skater on the screen at one time, which frees up RAM, but hey, there simply isn't anything as complex physics-wise on a console -- except perhaps Nintendo 64's Wave Race 64 -- as Tony Hawk Pro Skater.   Thankfully, the game is filled with great trick animations. Each move looks exactly like it should in real life. Want to know what's even better? The bail animations.  Each time a player falls, he or she crumples into a rolling gaggle of flopping arms and legs. Again, thankfully, even here Neversoft got it right. After a painful looking fall, a spatter of gratuitous blood spurts out, just to let you know yes, it did hurt. Too bad the clothes of the skaters didn't remain stained, that would have been cool.   The camera angle dilemma, which is usually a problem with many developers, wasn't one here.  The third-person camera simply follows the skater around, staying behind him or her no matter what trick is pulled off. Occasionally, when pulling off full 180 turns, the camera is slow, but players can generally grab the shoulder buttons to rearrange their perspective.  Sound For a game like skateboarding, the set of bands that Activision and Neversoft found are perfect. Each provides a sense of total rebellion and sweaty, anti-societal disgust that perfectly represents the skateboarding community's tastes. And even if nobody in the skateboarding world listens to this grungy punk, it creates a perfect mood for gamers to take to their nearest grindable surface and shred.   Although in my day the big skaters were Tony Alva and Ray Bones Rodriquez who skated to Devo's Uncontrollable Urge and Eddie Money's Two Tickets to Paradise, these bands rock hard and fast and make you want just bust out with great skateboarding moves of your own. Somehow, the eclectic mix of bands is perfect. This game needs a separately sold soundtrack, cause I'd buy it.   The sound effects are solid, if not terribly noticeable. When players fall, they make a generic grunting sound, but they don't scream or wail like real people would if they took the falls that these guys take. Still, the crowds are helpful and sound great in the contests. After each move, the crowd yells in approval or boos in disgust, depending on how well you perform. Either way, it creates a feeling of joy or determination to do better next time.        What can I say? Tony Hawk is the most superior skateboarding game I've ever seen or imagined, and it's got to be one of the most technically impressive games I've ever seen. With games like this coming out on PlayStation, there's no reason for anyone to think it's a dying system. Go and get one.", "date": "Oct 20, 1999"}
