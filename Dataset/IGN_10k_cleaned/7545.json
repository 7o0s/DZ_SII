A lot of really solid titles on the Gameboy Advance have benefited from keeping the gameplay simple and fastpaced. Unfortunately, developers also need to consider another important factor for their games: make it interesting! Flushed Away on the GBA is an example of a game that is relatively simple, but is just so boring that no amount of cute cutscene can save it from mediocrity.    Players follow the misadventures of Roddy St James, from his birthday party in his home in Kensington, to the sewers below, and back again. After Roddy gets flushed down the toilet by a sewer rat, he must fight for his life to get back home. Along the way he gets tangled up in a jewel heist and meets Rita, a tough girl mouse who's trying to stop the evil plans of the Toad. What's odd about Flushed Away is the way the developers split the story up. A lot of odd parts in the game, such as the act of getting flushed are actual levels, yet some of the more heroic moments, like Roddy and Rita's escape from a freezer, are glossed over in a cutscene.    The cutscenes are a mix of the obligatory screenshot montage and sprite animations. The sprite scenes are done very nicely, and some of the animations are funny and adorable. My favorite scene was when Rita and Roddy seal their partnership with a spit shake. The guys over at Altron did a smashing job of conveying that utterly disgusted look that only snobby upperclass British mice can make. The cut scenes are funny and cute, which is exactly what a game based on an Aardman film should look like.    The humor and charm of the cutscenes don't carry into the actual gameplay, which consists mostly of brawling/platforming, with a few shooter levels thrown into the mix. Players can choose between Roddy or Rita, but both characters are pretty much the same. The only real differences I saw were the jump attacks and the special attacks. Players guide their mouse of choice through somewhat mazelike levels, opening doors to progress to the next area. Impeding player's progress are a variety of baddies to punch and kick into submission. Roaches, flies, baby spider, rats, frogs, and slugs all try to stop Roddy and Rita. The enemies are not difficult at all, but there are a lot of them. As a result the game becomes more of a button masher than a platformer, and much of player's time will be spent rapidly tapping the B button until all the enemies are gone. While it is funny to watch Roddy try and fight - he gesticulates about like a madman - the levels quickly become monotonous. Even the boss battles are particularly interesting, and I found myself becoming bored with the game. It's not that Flushed Away is bad; it just doesn't do much to try and keep the player's interest.    The Jammy Dodger levels do offer a nice change of pace for the game, though it's more of a temporary distraction than an actual portion of the game. Players control Rita's boat, the Jammy Dodger, shooting at the henchrats that try and stop them. It's a fairly fun shooter level, though the collision detection is a little wonky. It was hard to tell if I had enough room to squeeze through the enemy attacks, which resulted in a lot of seemingly impossible to escape attacks.       Getting hurt doesn't really matter too much though, since the game is a cake walk. Flushed Away is obviously a game intended for a younger audience, and the developers have designed it in such a way. So I expected the game to be pretty easy. Still, I was somewhat shocked by how ridiculously easy the game actually is. It's very hard to players to die at all, especially since every bad guy drops a powerup, so Roddy or Rita are constantly healing. If players do manage to get killed, they can just continue. They don't have to start the level over; in fact oftentimes the player just picks up right where he left off. When it comes to boss battles, the player may resume the boss battle with their opponent at half health. I get that the title is supposed to be kept easy so that kids can beat it, but give kids some credit. The game should at least have a set number of lives, and then players have to start the level over after they lose all their lives.    I know D3 Publishing specializes in budget games, but they could have scrounged up the little bit of extra money it would take to create a save slot for the game. Flushed Away relies on passwords to resume the game, which is something I had thought was long past us. It's ridiculous, and it's unacceptable.Flushed Away is a very cute game. The characters are well done, and it manages to keep a lot of the charm the movie has in its story telling. The gameplay doesn't seem to match up well with the type of game it is, and it ends up being a somewhat boring beat-em-up title. The game is way too easy to appeal to anyone that has ever played a video game, and ends up being the fatal flaw that keeps this game from escaping the sewers.", "date": "Nov 9, 2006"}
