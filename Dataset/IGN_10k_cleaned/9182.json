Seeking justice for a crime committed ages ago, looking for payback from the one who's lived on, freely and without care, since the day of the despicable act  and in Fatal Fury, it's a mission born of murder. Jeff Bogard, a martial arts legend, was ruthlessly assassinated a generation ago by gang lord Geese Howard. And now his two sons, Terry and Andy, are pursuing their vengeance by entering Geese's new underground fighting tournament. The prize? A chance to face Geese himself in combat  and for the Bogard brothers, the chance to finally serve their father's killer his just desserts.   Fatal Fury is a one-on-one versus fighter produced by SNK. It follows Terry and Andy Bogard through the King of Fighters street-brawling tournament, and takes place throughout the neighborhoods of Geese Howard's home city of Southtown. Though on the surface it appears to be a game very similar to other titles in the genre, especially Capcom's Street Fighter II, it sets itself apart with its characters, environments, and, in the context of history, its incredibly long legacy of spin-offs and sequels.   The most immediately notable aspect of Fatal Fury isn't an altogether positive one, and that's its character selection screen. Though there is a whole roster of unique fighters filling out the cast of the game, only three of them are controllable by the player  Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, and their friend Joe Higashi. Playing alone, it's not that huge of a deal. It makes sense for the story's sake that only those three would be fighting to take on Geese, and each of the three controls uniquely and feels different. Terry's an all-around fighter whose signature move produces a column of fire that rushes along the ground. Andy's more acrobatic and can project a large Hadoken-like energy wave. Joe is the most unique of the three, and employs a Thai boxing style while also being able to whip up projectile hurricanes with a quick uppercut.     But taking on a friend in head-to-head combat is where the limitation becomes frustratingly restrictive, as Fatal Fury additionally doesn't allow two players to pick the same character. So after Player 1 makes his pick, Player 2 has a grand total of two options to choose from for his own fighter.   Interestingly, for all the restraint put on two-player play in this fighting title, there is a unique addition for multiple players  a co-op mode. Though it doesn't last long and it's a bit hard to manage, Fatal Fury allows you and a friend to work together against one computer-controlled opponent in a two-on-one variation of the normally one-on-one fighting system. It was a novel idea here that, unfortunately, didn't make it too far beyond this one game. But then some other innovations were lost afterwards too, like the two-plane system.   Fatal Fury isn't a direct side-to-side fighter. It instead employs two separate planes  a foreground and a background  that you can move between while brawling. Defensively, rolling or leaping to the other plane can be a great way to avoid an incoming projectile attack or other imminent strike. And offensively, it's possible to catch your opponent off guard by executing a plane-to-plane jump kick. Each of the environments in Southtown handles the plane system uniquely, and each one also changes visibly from round to round  day will turn to night, rain will blow in and the like as each fight continues.So Fatal Fury has a few different qualities that set it apart from other fighters of the age, and it could be of interest to fans of the genre for those reasons. But the final point to address about Fatal Fury is that it is, on its own, pretty basic when compared to all the many games to come later. This was SNK's first ever fighter, and the company developed and published nearly countless others afterward  including several direct sequels that improved on almost every aspect established first here.  You can feel good investing 900 Wii Points in a download of Fatal Fury if you're a past player looking to satisfy your sense of nostalgia, or if you just want to find out if the Bogard brothers manage to get their revenge on Geese. But if you hold on to those same nine bucks and wait for some of this game's later sequels, you'll find that they're much more robust and replayable. And they'll have more than just three selectable characters.", "date": "Oct 9, 2007"}
