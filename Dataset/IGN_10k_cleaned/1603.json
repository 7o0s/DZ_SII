While this might be a valid point with kids games in general, it's not a problem with Eidos Interactive's 102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue.   Despite the fact that 102 Dalmatians does have a major license and could probably sell based on that aspect alone, the developers haven't let that fact be a crutch to fall back on. 102 Dalmatians is a surprisingly good 3D-action title that should appeal to younger gamers based on both its license and its solid gameplay.   Gameplay  In 102 Dalmatians, gamers are put into the bodies of Oddball and Domino, two young Dalmatian puppies that must go out on a quest to save their brothers and sisters from the evil Cruella De Vil and her evil army of poorly-made, pet-napping toys. There are 20 levels in total, with the goal in each to find and release captured puppies, while also collecting bones and stickers to unlock special goodies. The levels are very basic in design and the level of challenge is pretty low, so it's definitely a game that won't frustrate even the youngest of gamers.   In addition, the game's level of presentation is extremely high, as there are plenty of cutscenes throughout each of the levels that help give players a little more insight about how the game's story is unfolding. What's more, beyond the 20 levels the game also features six mini-games that can be opened that are a load of fun for people of all ages. The mini-games aren't part of the natural story arch, but they are all very easy to play and can prove to be extremely addictive because of their simplicity.   Graphics  Just as the gameplay is solid but not spectacular, the same thing can be said about its visuals. There's nothing really bad about the graphics, as the polygonal models are decent, the framerate is passable, and there aren't any significant graphical glitches that come in the form of clipping or pop-up. The problem is that there's nothing here that'll blow you away or make you believe that the developers were able to push the PlayStation beyond what you had expected.   Sound  One of the best parts of the game is the fact that it contains a ton of different voices for all of the puppies that you rescue, plus many characters that you'll encounter throughout the game's 20 levels. As said earlier, the level of presentation is very high and because of it, it really helps the player feel like he or she is part of a real Disney movie. Beyond the voices, the audio includes some decent sound effects for barking and the like and a very kid-oriented, light and chipper musical soundtrack.  102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue has turned out to be a surprisingly good game. It's definitely not a game that I'd recommend for hardcore gamers who have been playing games for a long time because its main play mode is a bit on the easy side and can be beaten without much effort in a matter of hours. However, the game's difficulty and challenge level seem to be perfect for a beginning gamer and that combined with the excellent presentation really makes this one a winner. Add in the excellent mini-games, which are actually quite fun and addictive regardless of your skill level and you have yourself one of the most enjoyable kids titles of 2000.", "date": "Dec 6, 2000"}
