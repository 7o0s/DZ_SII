We got SNK vs. Capcom from SNK. We got Pokmon Trading Card Game from Nintendo. And now, here's Tecmo's take on the genre: Monster Rancher Battle Card GB. With the popularity of the cartoon in syndication and on Fox Kids, it just makes sense that Tecmo worked its license on the Game Boy Color  but it's not exactly an intuitive design, especially for the young 'uns.FeaturesFull RPG adventureNine monster characters from the cartoonMore than 100 different cardsBattery back-upLink Cable support for two playersFor Game Boy and Game Boy ColorMonster Rancher Battle Card GB has almost nothing to do with the PlayStation game that started the actual license. Instead, the title revolves entirely around the cartoon series of the same name. In this game, you play a Monster Breeder out to become the Master Breeder. To do this, you must traverse the land and challenge other Monster Breeders to a card game. Here, if you win, you'll earn more cards  if you collect all cards in the game and compete in all the licensed matches, you enter the ranks of ~Master Breeder.~ If you think this sounds vaguely familiar, you're not alone.Let me make one thing perfectly clear. The learning curve on Monster Rancher Battle Card GB is so steep, it's like Mount Everest. You're pretty much thrown into the action without any knowledge of how the game works  apart from the horrible rules told to you by a non-player character in town, there isn't any tutorial of the card battle. And unlike Pokmon Trading Card Game, Monster Rancher Battle Card GB isn't based on an existing, physical card game. It honestly took me a good three full matches to get the grasp of how the game works  and the instruction manual isn't much help, either. Tecmo must've also realized how confusing the game is  check out this memo sent with our review copy of the game. It's a shame that Tecmo doesn't include this with every copy of the game.In SNK vs. Capcom, you're attacking the opposing player. In Pokmon Trading Card Game, you're attacking the other player's monster cards. In Monster Rancher Battle Card GB, you're attacking the opposing players' ~Monster Team.~ At the beginning of the game, you're assigned a team of three Monster Rancher monsters from the cartoon series  the Miracle Team: Suezo, Tiger, and Gali; the Speed Team: Hare, Mocchi, and Dino; and the Powerful Team: Golem, Pixie, and Naga. Each of these teams has its own series of cards to use that correspond to the specific creature on the team. You can only hold five cards in your hand at a time, and you can only use the cards if you have enough ~Guts~ points  these points are accrued by discarding unwanted cards during the specific turn. There are Attack, Defense, and Breeder cards that have a specific ~Guts~ value as well as a Damage value. Defense cards are used during the other player's turn  if he attacks a specific character, and you have the proper defense card in your hand (as well as enough Guts points), you can evade the attack. Once all three of your creatures are knocked out, the match is over. If you knock his out, you win and take three of his cards. The learning curve is steep...but once the plateau is reached, it's all downhill with the wind at your back.The game's major problem lies within the fact that absolutely no care was taken in translating the text to English  there are many places within the game that you'll just scratch your head and go, ~huh?~ This translation problem contributes to the high learning curve at the beginning of the game, since one character tells you all the rules ahead of time  and does a poor job of explaining herself. And the interface is just downright bad  until you actually figure out how the game operates, you'll most likely be totally confused when it's your turn to make your moves. As an overall game, it's actually a lot of fun. It has its own unique take on the whole card battling genre, so it doesn't feel like a simple ~me-too!~ game. But it's obviously going up against heavy artillery in the form of Pokmon. Pokmon Trading Card Game beats out Monster Rancher Battle Card GB in terms of the card battle engine, but Monster Rancher Card spanks Pokmon Card in the RPG department  there's a lot more dungeon exploration and character interaction than in Nintendo's card game. But Pokmon Card is overall a better designed Game Boy game.It's a shame that a game like Monster Rancher Battle Card GB has to be so confusing to play  I just hope the target audience can get passed the horrid tutorial and high learning curve, because the game is a lot of fun. And the RPG is pretty huge, which means the game will last you a very long time. Learn the game and the interface. If you like the card battle genre, Monster Rancher is a good one.", "date": "May 3, 2000"}
