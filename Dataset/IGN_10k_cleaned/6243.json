Plane Crazy is one of those rare, addictive games that hooks playersfirst with its frustratingly difficult gameplay. Just reaching the end ofthe initial courses takes numerous attempts, and players with a lowthreshold for failure will likely give up on the game before it even beginsto reveal how good it really is. For those who simply refuse to let a gameget the best of them, however, the seemingly 'out-of-whack' difficultylevel soon gives way to finely tuned, and even more addictive gameplay.Plane Crazy is an unusual racing game in more than just the fact thatyou're not racing cars or hovercrafts or boats. One of the game's biggeststrengths, in fact, is in the way the tracks are laid out. Unlike mostracing games, including previous plane racing games, Plane Crazy does notfeature looping tracks. Instead the tracks are extremely long, from point Ato Z, journeys which offer a variety of pathways, and shortcuts along theway. The end result of these kinds of tracks is a real feeling of gettingsomewhere in each race, and because each track is so long, there's plentyfor players to enjoy and master along the way.In perfect harmony with the ~journey~ design of the tracks are the game'struly exotic graphics. Much in the same way, a well-designed platform gamelike Mario 64 becomes addictive because the player simply must see what'scoming next, so too is the effect of Plane Crazy which continuously revealsbeautifully rendered location after location as the tracks unfold. Althoughthe game still depends on videogame  clichs such as volcanoes and canyonsfor much of its look, there are other more imaginative tracks to enjoy aswell such as the Dockland Dive, which leads players through a busy harborfilled with giant ships and various other industrial hazards. These complextracks also lend themselves perfectly to multi-player action, which thegame supports with up to eight players over LAN or SegaSoft's own Heat.Net.One slightly less successful aspect of the game are the weapons which canbe picked up throughout the races. With all the twisting and turningrequired to finish the tracks before time runs out, using the somewhatless-than-dazzling weapons on your opponents never feels like much of apriority. The weapons certainly don't take away from the game's overallappeal, they just don't do much to enhance it is all. Of course, theweapons do serve more of a purpose in multi-player mode.Plane Crazy is an unusual mix of genres and gameplay elements all woventogether in a tight, addictive, and nice-to-look-at, package. The game isalso extremely challenging and a lot of fun to play in any of the its manymodes. If the idea of a plane racing game has always sounded intriguing,but you're still waiting to see the evidence that it can work - Plane Crazyis it. -- Patrick Baggatta", "date": "Dec 12, 1998"}
