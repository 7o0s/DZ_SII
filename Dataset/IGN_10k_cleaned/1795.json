Of course, if a team is blowing out an opponent by 20-30 points, then the last five minutes will probably as interesting as watching .  But I can see my friend's point; if the game is down to the wire, then there's almost nothing more exciting than watching two teams battle for every second of ball possession.  And that's basically the formula that Midway has taken with NBA Hoopz, where every minute throughout the game is an exciting battle, and no matter how behind you are, you can always make a comeback.  Of course, this works the other way as well  no matter how ahead you are, the computer will always make a comeback. NBA Hoopz is the natural evolution of Midway's NBA Showtime: NBA On NBC, and if you haven't played either games, I'm sure you've heard of the game that started the Midway's arcade ~basketbrawl~ game series, NBA JAM.  And if you haven't heard of any of those then you're probably not from this planet, but I'll explain nonetheless.  NBA Hoopz is all the exciting parts of basketball  the dunks, the hard fouls, the buzzer beaters  without the technical aspects of basketball that can often interrupt the flow of the game  like calling fouls.  So there's a lot of dunks, alley-ops, and shot making in this game, and if you want the ball back, just give your opponent a good hard shove.  Of course, you can't keep ramming your opponent on to the far, as each team is allowed four ~free fouls~ on the opposing team.  Go over this limit, and the opposing team will be allowed to shoot a free throw and should he make the free throw, the opposing team will also retain possession of the ball.  And of course, NBA Hoopz has the Midway trademark ~On Fire~ gameplay mechanic  have one player make three consecutive shots without having the opponent score, and that specific player will be on fire.  When a player is ~On Fire~, he has unlimited turbo, has the ability to goal tend, and rarely misses any shot from any range.  Additionally, if you can get your team to make three alley-op dunks in a row without having the opposition score, your whole team will be ~On Fire.~  Though the ~On Fire~ feature is nothing new, NBA Hoopz features two huge changes to the NBA Jam-like series of games.  Firstly, the game contains a bunch of mini-games to complement the main course of slamma-jamma action.  Though some of these mini-games are kinda boring (i.e. Around the World), some like 2 Ball, 21, and the 3 Point Shootout are definitely welcome additions.  Secondly, instead of having two players per team, each team is composed of three players  guard, forward, and center.  So now, you can select from a whole new listing of players and with the additional customize features, you can even create your own super team (i.e. Kidd, Kobe, and Zo).  Does adding a third party into the mix make NBA Hoopz drastically different from Midway's previous ~basketbrawl~ games?  Not really... especially since the game still features the ~rubber band AI~ that you either hate or really, really hate.  Like Midway's other arcade-sports games, NBA Hoopz features the legendary ~rubber-band AI~ and if you don't understand this concept, the game essentially gets ~easier~ when you're trailing behind in the score, allowing you to make long-range shots with ease.  However, once you're ahead of the pack, the computer suddenly starts sinking a sick amount of three-point shots, makes steals like you wouldn't believe, and blocks shots that are harder to believe.  So, in that sense, the game always comes down to the last minute of play, and to some, that's fun because the game is always close.  But to me, if you're doing well in the game, the last thing I want is the computer to get crazy and start pulling cheap tactics and sinking shots that would never happen... all of a sudden, Patrick Ewing is a 3 point threat when you're ahead by 12 points in the game.  The game doesn't sparkle in the visual department, but it's far from bad.  NBA Hoopz looks about the same as NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC on the Dreamcast, so don't expect a whole lot of improvement.  The game does feature a good amount of fluid player animation, decent special effects when it comes to being ~On Fire~, and sports a pretty cool intro FMV.  On a side note, something has to be done about the replay feature; whenever you make a particularly cool dunk, you'll get an instant replay from a different camera angle.  That's great if you want to see it, but if you don't want to see it... too bad.  There's no way to turn off instant replays from the options menu (though you can cancel them during the game). NBA Hoopz is the standard multi-player sports game for guys who don't play sport games.  Easy controls, simple gameplay mechanics,decent visuals, and multi-player capabilities make this an easy choice for party games.  As for a single player game, though it contains cool mini-games and nice customization features, the lack of depth in the gameplay and that annoying AI make NBA Hoopz a game that you grab only when you have company over.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Feb 21, 2001"}
