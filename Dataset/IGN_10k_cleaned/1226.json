You take your long, expensive stick, toss some string off the end of it into the water, and wait. Or, if you prefer, you can repeat the motion over and over again until some sort of aquatic animal gets its face stuck on the metal hook attached to the string. Then you fight with it for awhile, perhaps embarrassed that you can't more easily dispatch something a hundred times smaller than you, and either throw it right back and repeat the sequence or go home and eat it. Now, if only all that magic could be captured for use on your home PC.  I'm kidding, of course. As a semi-avid fisherman, I find PC fishing games intriguing. That is, I like the concept, but I've yet to find a game that really captures the sport, at least not so much that I've liked it. But hey, that doesn't mean we shouldn't keep trying. Unfortunately FLW doesn't seem to capture the magic, either. Maybe I'm just stuck in a rut, looking for a too true-to-life fishing experience, but this just doesn't fit the bill.  That isn't to say there aren't good things about the title. The boat maneuvering is great. In fact, that's the most fun part of the game. The acceleration on the boat is fast and realistic, and the accurate motor sounds complete the illusion. It's tempting to get in the boat and just zoom around the lake a few times, but there are time constraints to think of and there are probably games better suited to that particular activity. Still, it's fun.  What's less fun is getting out from the driver's seat and up to the deck for fishing, which is all of about five feet away. Perhaps the footage for this minute movement was stolen from a proper boat driving instructional video, because it goes on and on. A few seconds too much may not seem like much, but when you have to adjust your boat to move ten feet away to get closer to the fish you see, and then five feet back, and so on, it becomes a drag real fast.  Much of this game becomes a drag after a while. Even the casting movements are restrictive. It's not really possible to increase or decrease the casting distance  not without altering your cast-type. For shoot-'em-up enthusiasts, imagine a Doom configuration wherein to fire a long-range shot versus a point-blank shot, you've got to press completely different buttons or alter your options, instead of just pointing to the right place and firing your gun. That kind of bureaucracy takes away from the true-to-life fishing experience. The game is misleading like that, too, because you can easily target varying distances from the boat, but your lure seems to land very close to the same distance no matter where you target  only the heading seems to matter. When you fish in a real lake, on a real boat, you don't have to adjust your pole settings to cast nearer or farther, and that fact is not at all well represented here. The whole point of the actual act of fishing is the finesse. The flick of the wrist when casting, to reach the perfect distance from where you stand or sit; the twist from side to side as you pull the lure in. This game just doesn't have the free range of motion required to create the proper illusion of fishing freedom.  Ultimately, this fishing game seems more of a sim than a live-action replication. It's more about the know-how, the choice of lures to go with the proper fish, than the actual act of fishing. It's certainly limiting in its potential target audience in that sense.   By and large, the graphics are good. Your person and his fishermen opposition are all well rendered. Fishing hat, plaid, fishing vest, flannel, big rubber boots, the works. It's even got those tacky televised fishing tournament corporate sponsor logos everywhere. And I only wish I owned a boat as nice as the one in the game.  The depiction of the fish in the water, though, and the surrounding landscape, could be improved. It all looks like something rendered using the very first three-dimension technology  definitely three dimensions, just sort of distorted. It's hard to tell how far the fish (which are often clearly visible, near the surface of the water) really are from you. That would probably matter more if the game allowed for control of casting distance.  Sounds in the game are realistic enough, but not used so often or prevalently that they're even that noticeable. The splashing of the fish was about the only sound that enhanced my gaming experience, and everything else faded to the background. Whether sound belongs in the background or not varies from person to person.  Lasting appeal is where this game starts to fall apart. Most of its strengths come from pretty pictures and an easy but overly simple interface. These strengths become weaknesses in the long run, as the repetitive graphics become stale, the simplified interface leaves the user longing for a more real experience, and other game weaknesses take shape. For example, the lack of freedom of motion, or just the shortage of interesting lures and rods. Making a long story short, the game becomes tiresome, and quickly.   I enjoyed my fishing experience with FLW Tour 2000, but this isn't the kind of game that will make fans of the sport. And more than anything, it may leave you with a craving for the real thing, since this game doesn't satisfy so many of the urges that real fishing satisfies. Much the same way a game of tennis or baseball without that beautiful sound of the bat or racket hitting the ball would leave the user feeling empty, wanting something more. FLW Tour 2000 is perhaps a good teaching instrument, good for showing people what exactly comprises fishing, but it sure won't show anyone why it's fun.   -- Eric Benner      Want to share your opinions with the world?
