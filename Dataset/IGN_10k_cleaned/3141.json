In the US, however, that little fad hasn't caught on...yet. Hamtaro seems to be Nintendo's devious way of getting the sugary-sweet critters into the mitts of the unsuspecting public, starting with unleashing the characters on Cartoon Network in the localized Hamtaro: Little Hamsters Big Adventures. To compliment the 'toon, Nintendo has also released a clever little adventure on the Game Boy Color (100% compatible with the Game Boy Advance), Hamtaro: Ham-Hams Unite! And as sickeningly cute as these hamster are, this handheld game is very original and deceptively engrossing...even for the older crowd. How often does a cute game actually let you piddle on a friend? Features 15 hour quest 85 Hamchat phrases to learn Cartridge save (one slot) Infra-red port support for Dance and Photo trades Made specifically for Game Boy Color  Boss, the hamster leader of the Ham-Ham group (basically a clan of hamsters, each with their own personality) has just finished up work on the latest Clubhouse project. But to unveil his hard work, he needs to get everyone together. Players need to take control of Hamtaro the hamster and take him through the several different locations in the game to get all eleven Ham-Hams back to the clubhouse where Boss can show off his latest creation. Hamtaro: Ham-Hams Unite! is an extremely basic adventure, but it's deceptively fun and engrossing in its simplicity. Basically, all Hamtaro can do is talk in the Hamspeak language, but he can only say words that he's learned throughout the adventure. Each of the 85 different words in the Hamspeak language activates an action that can solve puzzles all over the different areas. Early in the adventure he's given the absolute basic of Hamspeak words: the standard Ham-Ham greeting (~Hamha!~),  a dig command (~Digdig!~), a sniffing command (~Hif-hif!~), and an rolling attack (~Tack-Q~). With these first four words in your vocabulary, you must set off into the real world and put them to use. When you meet a new face, give them a friendly ~Hamha!~ If you don't get anywhere with that critter, give them a rolling ~tack-q~ to force a conversation out of them. From there, it's up to you to figure out the proper words necessary to get through the adventure.  The puzzles in Hamtaro: Ham-Hams Unite! are plentiful, but generally easy to understand. After all, there's a finite amount of things you can do in the game, so if you don't get somewhere in one area, simply run around the different locations until you can activate a conversation with your limited Hamspeak vocabulary. When your Hamspeak choices include blanks with question marks, that's a prime hint that you need to hunt down another character in the game and learn a new word.  The game's obviously tailored for the young kids, what with its cute conversations and references to the Cartoon Network anime, but even I found myself stuck for a good couple of hours towards the end of the game. Luckily the roadblocks come few and far between...and usually when you get stuck it's because you overlooked something extremely simple.   The actual adventure is a good, solid 15 hours from start to finish, but even when it's all done, you're far from finished what the game has to offer. Hamtaro: Ham-Hams Unite!, like most of Nintendo's videogame offerings nowadays, is a game of collecting; You can complete the game with only 70 or so Hamspeak words in your vocabulary, so one challenge after you round up the troops and ~end~ the adventure is to complete your Hamspeak dictionary. Your hard-earned Sunflower Seeds (the game's currency) can also be exchanged for clothing items, which can then be worn back at the clubhouse; playing dress-up will alter Hamtaro's look on the title screen, and players can also trade their dress-up creations through the Game Boy Color's infra-red port (sorry GBA owners). And when the main quest is over, you can still go back through the different areas and locate the several hidden stars to finish the game one hundred percent. There are even a couple of simplistic mini-games, including Ham-Jam where players can piece together Hamspeak animations and ~dance~ to the music that they've collected in the adventure (ten different songs in all), as well as a silly little carnival game, ~Tack-Q Bowling.~ Hamtaro was actually released in Japan early last year, which would explain why it's released specifically for the Game Boy Color. The game's definitely not up there with the Game Boy Advance standard, but compared to what developers were pulling off on the GBC two years ago, this game actually looks quite nice in its simplistic colors. It's probably nothing more than a modified version of the overhead Pokemon engine, but the characters are large and well animated. And it's the animation that gives the game its personality; each of the 85 different hamspeak worlds has its own motions, and they're all drawn adorably. I'll be the first to admit that I was a little hesitant in reviewing the very first hamster game in the Game Boy's US library. Could I handle the syrupy sweet cuteness inside the box with that glassy-eyed hamster staring right back? But I was hooked into the adventure the second I found the ~Go-P~ command in my Hamspeak vocabulary. Yes, it does exactly what it sounds like. Activate this command, and Hamtaro relieves himself in the most adorable fashion. Why is it there? Who the heck cares! Go-P! All the way!The game's quest is a decently long one, with a clever little story that'll keep you interested until the quest is over. The payoff at the end is a little silly, but the designers insure that there's much more gameplay well after the adventure's completion. Hamtaro is one shockie game with lotsa bizzaroo hushies to hushgo.  It's definitely a spiffie, sparklie game. Bye-Q!", "date": "Nov 4, 2002"}
