From a class, or a meeting, or a party. There's always one person left, alone in the room, seeing the misarranged chairs and half-eaten food that serve as visual evidence that some event has recently ended. In 1994, that person was Toad.   It was the end of an era, the last year to see new releases for Nintendo's original home console, the NES. The system's life cycle had gone on for nearly a full decade, during which time Nintendo sold tens of millions of hardware units and hundreds of millions of games. But now it was all over. Most had moved on. Most had made the jump to the 16-bit generation, adopting either a Genesis or SNES. Quietly, the NES saw the release of its final game  Wario's Woods.   Toad was the one standing alone at the end, because though Wario's in the title, Toad is the star. The diminutive mushroom retainer had been playable only once before, in Super Mario Bros. 2  there he was a pint-sized powerhouse, the strongest selectable character. Here again in the Woods his physical prowess is put into play, lifting and shifting stacks of monsters.   Created in many colors, the creatures of the forest infest the interiors of towering trees. Toad, too, is inside the trunks, and is controlled directly by the player  but Wario's Woods isn't an action game or a platformer, it's a puzzler. Most ~falling block~ puzzlers give you direct control over the cascading pieces, or give you a cursor to move around tiles and blocks already stacked on the playing field. Wario's Woods is different, giving some character to what could have been a simple targeting reticule.   Toad can pick up and move monsters one at a time or in stacks around the pit. The goal is to align like-colored critters and then eliminate them with a bomb blast of the same shade  for example, if a red bomb appears at the top of the screen, grab as many red monsters as possible and position them underneath. When the bomb touches them, the explosion will clear them off the screen.   The gameplay is fairly simple to begin with, but gets more complicated when more varied and different types of monsters start showing up in each stage, and when Toad runs into a boss. A puzzle game with boss battles? Absolutely  Wario's Woods keeps things frantic and mixed up, so it's not just the same old stacking game over and over again.  And two players can go head-to-head in a competitive Vs. mode, making the madness even more manic.  The swan song of the NES never got much attention. Gamers had already moved on to other systems, for one, and its chances of finding an audience were further crippled by the fact that a superior SNES version of the same game was released on the same day. It's curious that Nintendo has chosen to send out the 8-bit Woods to Wii gamers, when the 16-bit version is more fully featured. On top of that, this NES edition is also available to owners of Animal Crossing, where it appears as a rare playable collectible. If you're interested in this title's place in Nintendo history, give it a download and see for yourself how the NES went out. But if you're more concerned with its unique take on puzzle genre gameplay, give this one a ~wait and see~  you'd be better served to spend your points on the SNES version, when and if it becomes available.", "date": "Dec 6, 2006"}
