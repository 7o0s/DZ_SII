Taken at face value it's a brief moment in cinematic history, but when one considers the chain reaction that the scene has created across multiple forms of media, it could be one of the most important science fiction scenes of the last 15 years.   From the countless comic book crossovers, proposed movie scripts, and overwhelming flood of videogames, Aliens vs. Predator is still a hot commodity. And with some of the most celebrated PC first-person shooters of the last couple of seasons still firmly rooted in the AvP universe, it was only a matter of time before games of this breed migrated back to consoles.   Rather than port an existing FPS onto one of today's leading set-top boxes, however, Electronic Arts and Zono Inc. have opted to take the less-traveled road and develop a unique real-time strategy title instead. Known as Aliens vs. Predator: Extinction (for both Xbox and PS2), this newest AvP is the first of its influence for consoles since way back in 1996. And while the guys here in the office were waiting with baited breath to delve into some extra-terrestrial ass-kicking action, the final result can only be described as ~terribly underwhelming~.   Gameplay  It's a hard pill to swallow actually, as AvP: Extinction seems on the surface to be a quality RTS title. Allowing users to select from all three races in the Alien vs. Predator universe (the third species being human colonial marines), the differing sides boast three diverse styles of play. The humans, for example, are masters of ranged combat and are perfect for picking off opponents from afar. Predators, on the other hand, are masters of melee battles and can have the advantage of numerous special abilities to give then an edge over their opponents. Finally, we come to the aliens; who have the distinct advantage of ~strength in numbers~. Faster and more agile than the other two sides, the aliens are all about overwhelming their competition.    It's in the weaknesses of each side, however, that the true difference between species can be found. Colonial Marines have to build individual units for every task they need to accomplish: Medics, Comm Techs, Synthetics, and every other basic unit in the game must be present in order to complete your missions. For the vast majority of the seven human missions, losing one type of unit from the core essentials pretty much spells the end of your day; forcing you to start the level all over again. That's not to say that the Predator's aren't limited in their abilities either. Because of the power of their units, their unit speed and overall numbers are greatly limited. Don't be surprised if you're sending six of these beasties against 20-25 aliens -- because it can happen. And while we're on the subject of aliens, they have perhaps the most vulnerable weakness of them all: They're almost exclusively melee fighters with no range whatsoever, and unless they're teamed in huge numbers, will get completely slaughtered by Marines and Predators alike. Their incredibly complex life cycle doesn't make things easy either.    In theory, the system sounds as though it might work, and the first two or three levels for each race it seems as if it does. As you continue to progress, however, and move into the later segments it becomes quite clear that the setup isn't that balanced at all. For starters, the Predators are completely dominant and because superior firepower and technology can bust through just about anything that gets in their way. In truth, their supposed weakness turns out to be nothing more than an illusion. On the flipside, the Alien missions feel as though they're almost crippled. Requiring you to pull off a variety of tasks to create a simple unit, there's a long list of goals you must meet in order to make an alien creature...   First the queen needs to lay an egg, and then it will hatch a face hugger. With the Face Hugger released and about it has to seek out another being to impregnate in order to become a chest burster. After it's done transforming into one of those, it will finally become a cocoon, and then once the cocoon has formed, it becomes whatever alien you've requested. Further complicating things is the fact that face huggers can't live beyond the influence of the hive (much like the Zerg in StarCraft) and for a good portion of the time, you'll need to send drones out to capture humans and drag them back to the influenced area. The distances between people and the influenced area can be ridiculous too, and in some cases can take as long as three minutes for an alien to drag just one body back to the hive -- Not very conducive to a species that thrives on speed and a high population.   Strangely, it's the alien missions that are most rewarding of the three. Though the human quests are easy to follow and contain plenty of gunfire and the Predator games allow you to mess with cool gadgets and overpower your opponents, the missions pretty much the same damn thing: Kill stuff; fix stuff; and don't die is the motto of the day. But rather than presenting the player will cool puzzles or obstacles to overcome (like we saw in the aforementioned StarCraft), Extinction merely moves characters from waypoint to waypoint with occasional reparation missions in-between. It rarely gets more complicated than that. But at least in the alien missions, players can break the monotony of the other two species and do something a little bit different -- even if it does take what feels like forever to build a useable army.    Speaking of building, one of the great joys of playing a terrific real-time strategy game is the art of base construction. Stacking up as many defensive structures as you can, filling it to the rafters with projectiles, and daring your opponent to come after you is a great alternative to typical invasion tactics. Sadly, that possibility is almost completely overlooked in Extinction with your only options being limited to manufacturing gun turrets. This unfortunate fact douse any hope for grand epic battles (which are already hindered by pre-stage unit caps in the first place) and degrade what's supposed to be an action-based thinking game into a straightforward shooter with occasional strategy elements.   Oh and did we mention that the A.I. is really poor? Regardless of what difficulty setting the game is set to, units from both sides will constantly bump into the smallest barriers and wander off on their own for no reason. Other peculiar happenings include Medics that stop healing people without being prompted; teammates who collide and force each other into a standstill only to be slaughtered by enemies, and completely sometimes-passive units who ignore their aggression command and do nothing. Think it sounds bizarre? Yeah, we did too.    Thankfully the experience isn't completely sour. The interface itself is intelligently designed and works better than nearly every other console RTS before it. Likewise, most of the alien campaign is pretty entertaining if you can look past its slow-natured shortcomings and the fact that your actions in one species' adventure affect the mission parameters in other scenarios is a nice touch. What's really tragic is, that in its best moments, Aliens vs. Predator can definitely feel like a solid real-time strategy game; but for the majority of the experience, those moments are few and far between.   Graphics  From an artistic standpoint, Extinction is an accurate portrayal of the Aliens vs. Predator universe.  Authentic takes on classic monster designs in conjunction with a couple of new ones mean that each and every character is 100% representative of the material that's inspired it. Understandably, the character models are small and their color palettes have been held back a bit (how else are you going to render 50 or more creatures onscreen at one time?). But one facet of those models that aren't so forgivable is the quality of animation.   Incredibly limited and eerily similar among the different units per side, the combatants have an almost clunky, robotic look to them. In fact, the highpoint of the whole animation system is probably when predators collect skulls and hold them up high in praise of their victory. The remaining opportunities for injections of personality are nothing more than various characters breathing or guys hanging around twirling their weapons -- it's not exactly the epitome of cool.    What makes Aliens vs. Predator: Extinction most painful on the eyes, though, are the drab and under detailed environments. Rarely moving beyond four primary colors (gray, green, brown, and blue), the differences between stages are minimal (other than a few polygonal obstacles or barriers, they're practically interchangeable). Similarly the textures used to map those environments are overly basic and uninspired and if you think it looks bad in the Xbox version, the PS2 rev has it even worse.   To its credit, the explosions, smoke, and particle effects appear to be halfway decent and the framerate remains pretty consistent throughout (though it'll definitely hiccup in the more populated areas). Other than those few shining gems, however, the overall look of the game is more reminiscent of late-generation PS One titles than that of modern-day software. Even the fog of war is ugly, and that's something we don't hear ourselves saying too often.   Sound  Presented in standard Dolby Pro Logic I, Aliens vs. Predator: Extinction shows promise from the start. The musical tracks and audio effects are taken directly from the Alien and Predator motion pictures and when paired with an ample receiver give the impression that you're listening to the films. From the sound of the marine's machine guns to the alien's scream as they're blown away, it's all completely authentic; and that familiar bass-like synthesizer sound associated with the Predator's vision modes is always worth listening too.    Strangely, the mixing of all these samples, music, and even occasional voice appears to be way off. And they overlap quite frequently. Several of the missions will begin with a narrator instructing you, only to be drowned out by the sounds of battle or some other type of commotion. The same rings true for the Foley in the midst of warfare as well -- because if there's too much going on at one time, the sound effects begin to bleed into each other for a huge mess of jumbled acoustics. If the mixing had been just a bit better, we're positive that each weapon and voice would have been a lot more distinguishable.With few RTS options for Xbox and PS2 fans of the genre, Aliens vs. Predator has the distinction of being one of, if not the best game of its type so far. The rub is, that in comparison to modern and pre-modern titles for both the PC and earlier consoles (Herzog Zwei and Utopia: Creation of a Nation run circles around it), that statement will end up holding very little water.For fans of the Alien and Predator franchises, however, there could be enough appeal via presentation and curiosity-factor to warrant a likely weekend rental or perhaps even a hesitant purchase. As it stands right now, though, enthusiasts may do themselves an even better service by running out to their local store and picking up the FPS ~Gold~ versions of Aliens vs. Predator 1 or 2 for the Windows format. Two games combined that equal the singular price of Extinction, they're infinitely more entertaining and better capture the essence of the AvP mythos.", "date": "Jul 30, 2003"}
