Going into its sixth iteration, Neversoft's Tony Hawk's Underground 2 is the culmination of six years or refinement, experiment, and expansion from a series that rewrote the way action videogames are played. Not to mention making Activision, Neversoft, and Tony Hawk himself very rich and very popular in the process.    Tony Hawk's Underground 2 finds itself in a weird position. On the one hand, the game is a refinement and an expansion from last year's well-received Tony Hawk's Underground. Neversoft has added new moves, created larger levels, and written a new storyline peppered with celebrities and punctuated with humor. It's also brought back Classic mode, i.e. the two-minute timer, for fans of the original four games. On the other hand, it's hard not to see Tony Hawk's Underground 2 as Neversoft's hurl-everything-you-can-in-a-last-ditch-effort in the hope to create something new. The effort, while recognized, is an example of a series that in many ways has perhaps run out of steam and good ideas, and fans of the series are likely to respond with a mixed reaction of disappointment, while grumpily trudging to the store to buy it anyway.    Story Vs. Classic  What Tony Hawk's Underground 2 has going for it is multi-fold. On the one hand, you've got the cleanest, silkiest mechanics of any skateboarding game that ever was. It's still just as fast and responsive and the gameplay just as addicting as ever. That said, having switched from the PS2 site to the Xbox site this past spring, I came to the sharp realization that many others have already reached some time ago -- while this game works pretty well on the Xbox controller, and is a strain on the GameCube and PC, it's designed perfectly to play on the PlayStation 2's Dual Shock controller. The placement of the face buttons, the ease of the four shoulder buttons, and the general ergonomic shape of the controller will assuredly bring the greatest joy to the PS2 owner. It'll also bring the greatest joy for other reasons, too, but I'll get to the online bit later.   Total THUG 2 Coverage Even the Birdman knows you've got to see this game in action in our video review, and if you're going to rent or buy the game, you'll most certainly need to read IGN Insider's Head-to-Head comparison. Where else will you find an in-depth breakdown of all the differences between the versions? No where. So just click below and be happy.

While I mostly enjoyed the story, other long-time players in our office vehemently dislike it, and when handed the controller, they went straight to Classic Mode. This re-introduction of pure, goal-based levels incorporates all of the levels from the Story mode and a handful of levels from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1-3 in a different order. So, you'll get to nab the Secret Tape, spell out Combo, collect the letters SKATE and attempt to earn the easy, medium, and hard point totals. You also have the choice to go really old school in Classic (and Story) Mode by going into Options and turning off Manual, Revert, Walking and 180 Spin Taps. It's clear the older levels weren't built for the new moves and vice versa, so there is some incongruence, but this option was at least well-thought out.    But many people will probably like the Story mode more than I. Moving forward from last year's complete reworking of the series, THUG 2 offers a storyline that's less endearing than last year's game, with less emphasis on you, the newbie star. Instead it focuses on how much terror and damage you can cause to your opponent team and the eight different regions you'll visit in your ~World Destruction Tour.~ Though luckily, you'll be able to play as you the noob, and a smaller selection of pros this year, as well as two special guests per level. You'll visit eight different regions, from Boston and New Orleans in the US, to Barcelona, Spain, Bondi Beach, Australia, Berlin, Germany, and more, in a story that's akin to a loose connection of skits than a real narrative. If you enjoy MTV's Jackass series, and the eat-this-bitch approach to humor, you'll enjoy Bam Margera's heavy spotlight in the game, which features his obnoxious, snarling humor at its best and worst.      What is clear in both the Story and Classic Modes is the somewhat contrasting emphasis on pure skill versus entertainment value. The Classic mode is focused entirely on the lean skateboarding skills that made the series so great, but also potentially difficult for newbies to jump in right away. The Story mode enables you to play around, explore and adventure, and it's easier. For instance, you could probably level up all your skills in the Test level. The goals often comprise throwing apples, finding graffiti artists on ledges, or ramming into bulls, as opposed to connecting stunning combos and finding subtly insane lines. In other words, they're not really skateboarding goals per say. Neversoft's attempts at pleasing everyone is deeply appreciated, and sales-wise, its approach has worked, but for those people weaned on the early games in the series, this game represents the game's continuance in the wrong direction, even with the keen addition of Classic Mode.    The Moves  The new, highly touted moves are perhaps the least significant additions to the series since Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. The Natas Spin enables you to spin in place on tree stumps and fire hydrants, and it's a decent addition because it adds in a random factor, since you'll often get thrown off in the least likely directions. The random placement of objects, such as apples and spray cans, enables players to throw stuff. This is a give-or-take addition that is of little consequence. The Freak Out is a moderately useful new move that's part entertainment, part useful. If you've built your special meter and you bail, you've given the chance to earn some of it back by mashing a button to refuel the Special gauge. It's novel fun that's entertaining to watch, since you'll genuinely feel like throwing your controller, but instead you can watch your skater hurl his skateboard in disgust. Though I used it a lot initially, it actually took too much time for my liking; it's often more satisfying to skip it and just try the movie again.   The Focus move runs on your Special Meter, slowly sapping it to produce a slow motion effect. This move is just a way to watch you move slower, with more emphasis on what you did right and wrong, and so in a sense it's a learning tool, but it's also cool just to watch your move, much in the same way you watch a replay in Gran Turismo or Madden NFL 2005.    The two best moves are the Sticker Slap, which is a slightly re-tinkered Wall Plant, and the front and back flips. The Sticker Slap shows your skater jumping to a wall, planting a sticker on it, and then jumping off it with good air distance and speed. The result is excellence. It works extremely well in creating new combos that wouldn't have normally been there, and it's fascinating to try it out everywhere. The front and back flips and the rolls enable you to manually pull off flips as opposed to being part of a pre-made move. They significantly add to your combo selection and point total. These last two moves will no doubt please old-school fans the most, given their pure functionality.   One of the series' strengths has always been its level designs, and THUG 2 is no different. While New Orleans and even Boston to a certain extent are more cramped, with Barcelona being an excellent blend of both large and small sensibilities, Berlin is like last year's San Diego level -- large, broad and filled with long lines. All of the levels contain more internal rooms, vertical height, and warp rooms. There are also some excellent catapults. Yes, catapults that hurl you across the level. The biggest difference in this game, however, is that these levels transform. Each one features a trigger section that leads to a scripted cutscene. Once you've touched it off, you'll find a totally expanded level, with Barcelona being the perfect example. The extended boardwalk creates a huge new potential for railing, pulling off long combos and connecting tons of tricks.     The Dark Side  On the flip side, the larger, more opportunistic levels create slowdown in all versions. The slowdown generally occurs in quick spurts, but it's also accompanied by some other irritating technical difficulties not normally seen too often in Tony Hawk games. You'll see an awful lot of texture loading, thanks to the larger levels. The introduction of a seamless day-night cycle causes odd-colored patches and erroneous shadows. The camera is also less polished in close-up areas than before. A few times my character caught on an object, and other times, I saw through to the back of buildings and into Steve-O and his Bull. They're empty, of course, but that was weird and confusing.   While I'm complaining, the one thing that I really disliked about getting off the board last year was not fixed, or not fixed significantly enough. After trying to incorporate walking and climbing into my repertoire, I still really intensely dislike the off-the-board controls. They're clunky, awkward, and are a complete contrast to the smooth, silky skateboarding experience. Simply measuring a jump is difficult and takes numerous tries, no to mention landing it. It's not fun; it's painful. As a platformer, THUG 2 is a rough and annoying experience. And while THUG 2's levels incorporate tagging and walking around better, both leave you with bad taste in your mouth. Also, I could easily miss the special vehicles (Seques, wheelchairs, go-karts, etc.). They're better than last year's lunar-atmosphere cars, but they still pale in comparison to straight skateboards themselves.   Finally, the Cube version is not online. But that's not really that surprising, is it? Nintendo has all but ditched any attempts at going online in this generation, so Cube fans are left to nibble on old two-player mini-games like the rest of us.    Graphics  For the first time in the series, the art style has drastically changed, and mostly for the better. The characters in THUG 2 more or less resemble super-deformed cartoon versions of their real selves, being smaller, and having less realistic body shapes and sizes. The facial expressions, overall, appear to be better as a result, and the motion capture work is once again very well done.  The result, if you remember, is not all that different than the look from Jet Set Radio or a few other early skateboard games. While it's certainly a big style change, it's only a slight visual improvement over past games.   As part of this transformation, the backgrounds and the color palettes have changed too. You'll see much brighter levels (though Germany is still filled with rather dull, yellow and burnt oranges) and more primary colors all around.  For Xbox, the added 720p support creates a crisper, sharper look. While on the PS2, the game often gets blurry and texture and object pop-in is more obvious and painful -- especially in widescreen mode.    Sound  Like last year's game, THUG 2 offers an enormous selection of musical tastes, and Neversoft smartly offers you the choice of creating your own customized soundtrack from the enormous list of 53 songs. Xbox owners won't be able to rip their own music, but the range of music is perhaps Neversoft's broadest yet. You like the Doors, Frank Sinatra, and Johnny Cash? Well, you'll hear them all: Break On Through, That's Life, and Ring of Fire, respectively. The excess of well-picked songs is great. You'll hear songs from punk, rock, hip-hip/rap and more. Here's just a sampler: Fear (I love Living in the City); Iggy and the Stooges (1970); Joy Division (Warsaw); Metallica (Whiplash); The Sugarhill Gang (Rapper's Delight); X (Los Angeles); and the D.O.C.'s Whirlwind Pyramid.    All of the celebrities performed their on voice-over work, so the voices sound authentic and realistic. The sound effects are also crisp and clear, and there is a large range of effects to accompany all of the destruction you will deliver. Dolby Digital is automatically recognized in all console versions.Tony Hawk's Underground 2 is an extension of a reworked game that's smartly designed but in many ways is just too much of the same. Too many new insignificant features, too much off-skateboard ~adventuring,~ -- that's actually pretty bad -- and a direction that appears to be moving far, far away from the original games. After tinkering with all of the Create levels from last year, I re-realized that while it's great fun to scan in your face (on the PS2 version), to create a level, and in this year's version, to create your own tag, these features have little to do with actual skateboarding. They complement the skateboarding experience, but they don't significant alter or improve the basic set of skills and core gameplay that's become the Tony Hawk experience. Still, the return of the classic mode is an excellent move, and it's bound to satisfy some old-school fans, but at this point, one has to wonder how much more Tony Hawk one can take. It's almost as if after playing this game, you just want to dust off Tony Hawk 2 and 3 instead. The inclusion of online play for PS2 fans should be rejoiced, while Xbox, GameCube and PC gamers are left with 10 mini-games that have all appeared in previous iterations. In other words, scraps from the table. The Cube gets a slightly lower score than the Xbox version (0.1 less) because it's so much more difficult to control.", "date": "Oct 5, 2004"}
