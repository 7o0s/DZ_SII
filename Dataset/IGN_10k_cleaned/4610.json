And while a select few pieces of software actually do manage to break through with some interesting ideas (MLB 2005's use of the EyeToy; MVP Baseball's pitching technique), a truly evolutionary step towards changing the face of an entire genre hasn't been made for quite some time. Though some may argue that NBA Live 2003's freestyle ball control was the last big step towards transforming the game of basketball, that inclusion was really nothing more than a much needed enhancement to a pre-established form of hoops. If Live 2003 had truly innovated, it would have marked the beginning of a whole new industry-wide approach towards designing basketball games. But as it stands now, it was simply the first to standardize non-passing functions with the analog stick while ball moving handling away from the face buttons.   With Electronic Arts' newest boxing title EA Sports Fight Night 2004, however, an example of true innovation may finally be among us. So incredibly simple in concept that it escapes our thoughts as to how we had never imagined it before, the game's all-new ~Total Punch Control~ mechanic could literally change the way boxing games are made forever. In fact, this new element of gameplay is so far beyond the idea of simply changing a control scheme or augmenting an existing feature that we almost feel silly comparing it to the jump that EA's basketball title made in 2002 -- it's really that significant a change.   But the real question is whether or not this advancement in the realm of digital boxing is enough to make Fight Night 2004 a truly standout game. It's a terrific idea and an interesting way of hooking curious pugilist fans for sure, but is it really enough to keep them hooked after playing a couple of matches? Gladly, the answer to that question appears to be a definite yes even if there are plenty of rough spots.    Gameplay  The reason Fight Night is so innovative is because of its new approach to how fighters throw and react to punches. While every other pugilism simulator on the planet has always consigned commands to the face buttons with an occasional use for other input keys, Fight Night 2004 has opted to move the scheme to the right analog stick instead. Rather than just use the configuration as a supplement to your normal arsenal of punches, however, the team at EA has mapped nearly every possible attack directly to the stick. Only after players master the proper motions of this device will they be able to step into the ring and go toe-to-toe with another hard-bodied opponent.   Head-to-Head Comparison! Wondering if both versions have widescreen mode or progressive scan? Are special punches on the Xbox unfortunately misplaced on the controller? And does this looks as good on the PS2 as it does on Xbox?   IGN Insiders can check out this detailed comparison between the PS2 and Xbox versions of Fight Night 2004. We provide details on everything you need to know to make a smart buy or rent, including sweet side-by-side screenshots.  Read It Now!   To be more specific, players literally have to ~throw~ their punches in order to perform them. Should a user want to jab with a right-handed boxer, for instance, they'll quickly have to tap the upper-left portion of the stick to get that jab to work. Moving the stick in a half circle in either direction gives players complete control of their hooks; while a quick snap downward followed by a fireball motion is how one can perform an uppercut. Should players want to execute an illegal blow, head butt, super punch, or bust a taunt, they can use the remaining face buttons or hold the left shoulder button (while punching) for attacks to the body.    This new control scheme isn't limited to the implementation of punches either; it works for defensive posturing too. Holding down the left shoulder button for an extended period of time allows gamers to roll their upper body around in full circular movement, while holding the right shoulder button activates the blocking feature. While blocking, pushing up, down, left, and right specifically aims your arms in the direction you need to defend; and if you can time the blocks properly to meet the end of your enemy's punches, you can halt their momentum and follow-up with a counter punch of your own. Needless to say, this combination of moves and abilities provides for quite a number of impressive strategies regardless of styles and personality.   In fact, it's this good use of strategy that ultimately makes Fight Night so appealing to boxing fans. Though the game definitely lends itself well to fast-paced slugfests and bomb wars (we can't even begin to tell you how many ~special punch contests~ we've had in this office already), it still rewards skillful players more than any other sports title we've recently played. Since there's no catch-up A.I., no guaranteed money punch, and no way not to defend against every attack in the game, two truly skilled opponents can have incredibly epic clashes with as much action and drama as the Arturo Gatti/Mickey Ward trilogy.   Unfortunately Fight Night 2004 still needs quite a bit of work in a number of different areas; especially in terms of CPU-controlled strategy and its artificial intelligence. Though it is impressive to see guys like Roy Jones Jr. and Ray Leonard boxing with the same stylish hit-and-run tactics that they use in real life, the artificially created boxers used to fill out the career mode only seem to have two basic strategies: walk forward or run for their life. It really is a shame too, as watching fighters like Evander Hoyfield bully his opponents on the inside or Lennox Lewis picking people apart with his jab shows you just what the CPU could have been capable of if given a little more attention. But with just about every opponent other than the licensed fighters offering almost nothing in terms of diversity or techniques, the single player campaign gets a little too easy for experienced players.    Most of the other issues we had will likely be considered rather insignificant for more casual boxing fans, while proving a little peskier for hardcore participants. The lack of some kind of clinching move (which was said to have been removed for speed issues), for instance, could have proved to be a valuable tool for more defensive-minded pugilists. While standing eight-counts or TKOs based on damage could have added a lot more realism to the overall flow of a match. As it stands now, the only way to be knocked out is to miss the ten-count or get knocked down three times in a round; but if it were possible to lose a fight based on facial damage or for taking too many punches, it could have made our fights a lot more interesting.   That said, the Fight Night boxing engine is still incredibly flexible, responsive, and natural. Though there is a somewhat hefty learning curve for players not exactly accustomed to using their analog sticks so much, five or six matches of experience can quickly turn naysayers into believers. But in the off-chance that players can't accept the new control mapping, they can always select a face button-only option to suit their tastes better. Happily, EA has given analog stick users a boost in this regard as the number of combinations that can be put together, feints, and similar more subtle techniques, have been either limited or eliminated should you choose to use the buttons only. Good move.    Features  While Fight Night offers users a good deal of options considering the genre, we couldn't help but feel overly disappointed with what we had to toy with in the end. Despite the fact that the game allows users to create and edit boxers on a much greater level than Knockout Kings ever did, it's still nowhere near as dynamic or expansive as games like Tiger Woods or Smackdown. And while it's great that there's a wide selection of trunks, gloves, and other Everlast-licensed material, it's baffling to learn that there is no option to change the color of those items once they've been purchased. It's also kind of a bummer that you'll need to unlock the same set of trunks, shoes, and the like all over again each time you play a new career. Even so, Fight Night's creation feature is still strong enough to generate a wide selection of alter egos, and is a more than acceptable attempt for a first year sports product.   If licensed guys are what you're looking for, however, then Fight Night has plenty of them. From legendary fighters like Ray Robinson, Muhammad Ali, and Joe Frazier to modern warriors such as Bernard Hopkins, Winky Wright, and James Toney, there's a great selection of personalities to choose from (32 in all). Interestingly enough, a good deal of fighters from the Knockout Kings series have been left on the cutting room floor  with the Klitschko brothers, David Tua, and several other favorites nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, highly respected but lower profile guys like Jean-Marc Mormeck, Joe Calzaghe, and Manny Pacquiao are still waiting to be digitally immortalized.   The mode where most gamers are going to spend the majority of their time is likely the career option -- which most closely resembles the old ranking tree created by Evander Holyfield's Read Deal Boxing on Sega Genesis. Made up of 50 different fighters, this ranking system is as simple as it gets; with the player being given opportunities to face several opponents of higher and lower ranks so that they may eventually earn a shot at the championship. In all, there are six different weight classes to choose from with different unlockable bonuses attached to each class (though almost all of them are related to what kind of attire you can buy in the Fight Store). As players continue to win fights, they'll earn more money, higher ranks, and the opportunity to ring walk to more elaborate pyrotechnic productions. It's this revolving system that serves as they basis for a fighter's general career.    To be truthful, though, there isn't a whole lot of satisfaction in making money to buy the same items you've purchased over and over again. Since your unlocked attire resets every time you start a new career, your motivation for playing through a season again gets smaller and smaller each and every time out. Granted, there is a definite satisfaction in winning world titles and finding your favorite sets of clothing, but there's so much more than could have been done here to prolong the life of the title. Why not use your money to purchase the contracts of better cut men to keep your bleeding down in big fights? Why not be able to hire new managers so that your training sequences are more efficient? Why can't you gain weight and move up a division to conquer another weight class like you did your first one (as was originally promised)? And why can't we decide our own fight schedule for the entire year or decide specifically what kind of training regiment we want to partake in? Any one of those additions mentioned above could have added a lot to the overall staying power of the game.    Don't get us wrong, Fight Night's career mode still has a rather addictive quality about it and should be fun to play for at least a couple of weeks; but in the grand scheme of things it just doesn't have the staying power that franchise-based EA Sports titles like Madden and Live offer with all their different game modes. Of course, none of this poses a problem if you can find a group of friends to scrap with all the time, and it's in this area where Fight Night truly excels. This is an incredible two-player experience and is almost as much fun to watch as it is to play.   Unfortunately, it's in this multiplayer department where the Xbox version comes in a little short. Because the PlayStation 2 edition offers a deep online ranking and matching service, complete with occasional tournaments and weekly updates, it gives players with a broadband adapter a real incentive to keep practicing and playing months after they've already bested the CPU. This mode is made even better by the fact that the experience is almost completely lag free with full-on USB headset support should you have the peripheral. To say that online huge difference in the game's replayablity would be an understatement. Without Xbox Live in the mix, sadly, green box owners are likely to run out of things to do a whole lot faster.   Graphics  Fight Night's visual presentation is excellent; with high quality models and some terrific facial recreations of all our favorite boxers (Lennox Lewis and Roy Jones are so accurate it's scary). To add an even larger dose of realism, EA has also incorporated a great deal of facial deformation and damage effects so that as the fight wears on, each boxer reflects the type of bout he's been participating in. Bloody noses, swollen eyes, puffy cheeks, and a bevy of other painful looking lacerations literally overtake your pugilist's mug as the match wears on, and it's all treated with an eerie realism.    Surprisingly, the graphical differences between the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions are minimal. Though the Xbox effort is a lot sharper with less aliasing and boasts a widescreen mode that works better than the PS2 edition's (for some unexplainable reason, the widescreen option results in big framerate drops and slowdown for the PlayStation 2). The rest of game's visual aspects are virtually identical in every way for both platforms.   Of course, Fight Night's most talked about graphical aspect are its knockdowns. No longer determined by pre-canned animations, knockdowns and KOs are determined by a rag doll physics engine that encourages a fighter's body to react based on the position of his opponent's fist, his own stance when hit, and the speed and strength of the punch. For the most part, the end results are pretty spectacular; with realistic reactions and some truly brutal looking knockdowns. The system certainly isn't perfect, though, as there are occasional instances where a fighter's head will clip through the ring canvas or that his legs will stutter uncontrollably until the replays start, but such are the growing pains associated with a first-generation rag doll effect.   Sound  In keeping with its tradition of supplying its athletic titles with the popular EA Sports Trax line of music, Fight Night has a decent list of transition and introductory songs from artists like Cee-Lo, Stat Quo, Federation Feat, and Lil Scrappy. Puff Daddy's remix of the training theme from Rocky, in particular, stands out as one of the best boxing game menu songs we've ever heard. Fight Night's audio effects, be it the sting of a punch or the roar of the crowd, are equally impressive and leagues better than the samples used in Knockout Kings a few years back.    But one aspect of the game we can't fathom is the choice to include hip-hop icon Big Tigger as the announcer and commentator. As cool as he may be in the MTV circle, his style of announcing and sparse general annotations are vague, simplistic, and definitely out of place. The whole premise behind Fight Night is to make the most realistic boxing game around, and having a rapper hop up onto the canvas and do the introductions for a heavyweight title fight doesn't sell us on that idea. Hopefully it's a presentation issue that will be remedied next year.EA Sports Fight Night 2004 is an ambitious attempt at not only reinventing the dead Knockout Kings franchise, but also the videogame boxing genre. For the most part it has succeeded too, as not only has it created an all-new level of control that makes every pugilism title before it look like child's play, it's also created a mechanic so flexible and natural that it should very well change the way developers look at the sport from now on.The funny thing is that because of Fight Night's revolutionary control mechanic and its deep boxing strategy, it makes the rest of the game seem under realized in comparison. Though the career mode is adequate and fun to play through for a couple of weeks, it still could have been a lot more than it was. And it's because of that fact that the Xbox version doesn't quite stand up to its PS2 counterpart and its much-needed addition of online play. As the broadband adapter literally quadruples the life of the game several times over.But that still doesn't mean that there isn't a lot of fun to be had offline as well. While it may not last you a long as it would with the benefit of an Internet connection, it's still a terrific way to pass the time with your buddies. Looking forward, there's a ton of future potential here and when considering the fact that the gameplay system is so responsive and fun that just playing with it overshadows any feature-based shortcoming, it says a lot about what kind of software this can truly become. We can't wait to see how this all comes together next year.", "date": "Apr 2, 2004"}
