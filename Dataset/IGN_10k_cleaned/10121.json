Whether it's a lame script from a writer that thinks he's a neo-Shakespeare, actors that the play to the camera like its the front row at dinner theater, or props that look like thrift store wares glued together and covered by a rattle can, there's something to love in an earnest failure. The same goes for a bad videogame. And Time Traveler is indeed a bad videogame.   But it's a howl to play.   Time Traveler, released in arcades in 1991 by Sega, is a full-motion video action game that utilizes real actors to tell an incompressible tale. The hero is a cowboy sucked into a time warp by a princess' supercomputer. The cowboy, Marshall, must travel from the Old West to the far future in order to rescue the princess Kyi-La from the evil genius Vulcor. Along the way, he makes stops in feudal Japan and medieval Europe. The yarn is a barebones frame for a few dozen Dragon's Lair-esque scenes of pressing a joystick and button in specific combinations to avoid instant death.   The game shares more than just basic game play DNA with Dragon's Lair. Time Traveler was designed by Rick Dyer, who worked closely with Don Bluth to create Dragon's Lair back in 1983. Dyer was an early evangelist for interactive movies and his collection of works includes some key titles from the genre, such as Space Ace, as well the invention of the Halcyon, a prototype home console that played interactive movies such as Thayer's Quest.   However, unless Dragon's Lair, which employed some still breathtaking production values (the animation is excellent), Time Traveler is decidedly budget. Not only is the acting ridiculous, but the props and costumes look like they came from a local high school drama department. The special effects are also goofy, with brightly painted on laser beams and lightning bolts that look worse than the effects seen in 1980s sci-fi flops. But here's the catch, the game looks so ridiculously bad that you have to smile. At some point during production, you just know Dyer and everybody involved had to recognize just how pitiful the production looked and just went for it anyway. It's that kind of dedication that garners respect.   We used better costumes in my high school production of   Time Traveler was the first game in Sega's new line of 3D arcade games called Hologram. (The other is an unplayable fighting game called Holosseum.) Sega used mirrors and a refractive lens to project the display in a way that made it look like it was floating in midair. Make no mistake, though. Time Traveler is not using a volumetric display. This is trickery -- effective trickery, though. To hopefully complete the illusion, Sega glued a series of neon painted blocks to the flat window to make the display look as if it was floating in front of it. Those blocks... those might have looked cool in 1975. But in 1991, neon was hardly an eye-grabber.   Anyway, the game play in Time Traveler is pretty poor. Since it lacks the production values of something like Dragon's Lair or Space Ace, you're forced to see the hollow core of the game. This is a basic timing game with very little depth and replay value. The sequences had incredibly short windows to input commands, thus coaxing more quarters from your pockets to buy extra continues -- or ~Reversal Cubes,~ as they were called by the wizard that oversaw your quest in Time traveler.   I remember being moderately amused by the game in a local arcade back in 1991, but didn't spend a lot of quarters on it. However, I have logged some extensive goof-off time with the cabinet in recent years as somebody close to me was able to snag a working machine in exquisite condition. Playing for free affords you the opportunity to really appreciate how silly the game is and how cheap/cool the faked hologram effect really is.   Digital Leisure released Time Traveler for DVD players back in 2001. Naturally, there is no holographic effect in play, but the disc did come with 3D glasses to fudge the volumetric display. (Success rate: Low.) I did appreciate that Digital Leisure actually recreated the neon shapes in the backdrop, though. That was clever. However, on a DVD player without the fake hologram, Time Traveler fares even worse.  Time Traveler was a clever attempt by Sega to infuse a little juice in the troubled arcade scene here in America. The faked volumetric display deserved an A for effort, even if the actual movie scenes themselves were decidedly Z-grade. If you stumble upon the game in an arcade, it's definitely worth checking out once or twice to witness a strange moment in arcade history. At home, though, Time Traveler isn't worth the effort unless you have a soft spot for bad cinema. In that context, it's good for a laugh -- but at no point will you be convinced that Time Traveler is a good game by any definition.", "date": "Mar 3, 2008"}
