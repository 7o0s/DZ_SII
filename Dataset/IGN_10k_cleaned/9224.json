It's been done before in Homeworld, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica and other sci-fi venues and there's nothing really here that stands out as particularly dramatic or original. The story itself is told through written journals and briefings between the missions but it's a bit hard to follow and not terribly rewarding if you bother to make the effort. There are some interesting dramatic devices within the missions but there's a definite lack of personality among the few recognizable characters. Your own character seems to have no interaction with anyone else in the game, leaving you to wonder whether or not your character is merely an excuse to have a point-of-view in the cockpit.  The player is part of an elite fighter unit that's sent out to fight off enemy attackers, investigate strange anomalies and escort shuttles as they recover artifacts or personnel. There are nine missions here, each of which is divided into lengthy sections separated by checkpoints where your progress is saved and your weapons are replenished. The missions unfortunately play out in a very linear fashion so you're not given much freedom to do things your own way. In fact, you can fail a mission by straying too far from the script. In some cases, this can even lead to some ridiculous failures. In one mission, I sped towards our next objective but I overshot my squad leader so far that I failed the mission. In some cases, objectives that you know you need to destroy -- like minefields or generators -- can't even be selected as targets until you complete other objectives. While it fits a certain military protocol, it feels a bit limiting and arbitrary.   On the good side, the enemies are incredibly agile and really know how to fly. Sure, some of the enemies can be found flying straight and level when you get the jump on them (and one memorable enemy wasn't even moving at all), but for the most part, the enemies zip around so quickly that it will really challenge your piloting skills. The friendly AI can generally be counted on to stay alive through the fight and may even score a few kills now and then. Still, their main reason for existing is to draw some of the fire away from and give you a chance to be the hero.  There are plenty of opportunities to engage in some heroic activities but most of them involve dogfighting with small enemy ships. There are some larger capital ship fights and some attacks on large installations, but for the most part, you'll be turning and burning with small interceptors throughout the course of the game. Though your own ships evolve, the enemies don't. It gives you a great sense that your power is growing -- after all, who doesn't like to load up a new weapon and see how many fewer shots it takes to destroy your enemies -- but it seems that the game ramps up the difficulty by adding more and more fixed turrets to the installations in the later levels. It makes it more difficult but not more interesting.   We like the interface in Tarr Chronicles quite a bit. The game is as enjoyable with the keyboard and mouse as it is with a full-featured flight stick and yoke. Commands are limited to selecting and firing weapons, finding targets and using afterburners. There's a ~use~ command in the manual but we never found a use for it in the game. While some space simmers like to monkey about with power management and shield facings, the lack of complex controls in Tarr Chronicles keeps the focus on action and in this case, that's as it should be.      In between each mission you'll have the chance to customize your ship in a number of interesting ways. Choosing whether or not to load up a bulky, slow-turning ship with a ton of weapons and powerful defenses or whether to take a smaller ship that relies on speed and agility to make up for its lack of weapons and defenses is one of the better aspects of the game. You'll have to juggle the weight requirements of your hull and the energy output of your reactor with the types of components you want to install. Finding just the right balance requires some careful consideration of how you want to play the game and since there are new hull types and components available after every mission, your ship will evolve frequently throughout the course of the game. There's even a tinkering system where you can disassemble items to create new, more powerful items. If all this makes your eyes glaze over, there's a handy option where you can ask the game to select a ship load out for you based on some general roles.   Visually, the game is quite good. While it might not be realistic, the accumulation of objects and galactic phenomena in space definitely adds to the visual variety of each level. Some of the levels even introduce a fog effect that limits your visibility considerably. It's a great way to add to the sense of menace and uncertainty. Most of those levels involve flying through massive skeletal structures and frameworks, so it's not too disorienting. The weapon effects are definitely impressive and the smoke trails from damaged ships give you a good cue to look out for the game's spectacular explosions. The ship designs leave a lot to be desired, however, purely because they all look so similar. Not being able to tell the difference between a capital ship and a transport is kind of a problem. Nevertheless, the texture work on the ships gives them a real sense of weight and age.  Sounds are much less impressive. The voiceovers are uninspired and don't really communicate the drama you'd expect from the events you're taking part in. In fact, they're so laid-back that you'll often miss things that are being said because the weapon effects overpower the dialogue. We don't get many good space shooters so fans of the genre have to take what they can get. The wait between games like Freespace and Freelancer is far too long to let even the average space sim slip through the cracks. That pretty much sums our feelings about Tarr Chronicles. Though it's not exceptional in any one area, it manages to provide some enjoyable combat with neat customization options and graphics that are easy on the eyes. So while it's not likely to attract many new people to the sorely underrepresented genre, it certainly fills a void for those of us who are still waiting for a developer to recapture the glories of the space combat games of the late 1990s. Till then Tarr Chronicles will tide you over.", "date": "Oct 12, 2007"}
