Terror truly is the greatest of all evils, and it leaves us upstanding hedonistic folk with only one option - to bet on Rainbow (or possibly black, if Wesley Snipes happens by). That's right, you vice blocking varmints, the boys from Rainbow are back in town to defend our democratic right to free shrimp, to frag grenade that bastard pokey machine which never pays out, and to whip out their beefy new hardware to over-compensate once and for all for their girly military call-sign. In short, all bets are offoff the Richter, that is.   For those of you who have been barricaded in your bedroom watching an endless loop of eighties action movie trailers (like we clearly have been); Rainbow Six Vegas was a first person shooter released in late 2006 that succeeded in both wowing the critics and making Mr. Tom Clancy even richer (lay off, Tom's Learjet is in disrepair, okay?). Being the fifth game in the long running Rainbow series, Ubisoft opted to shake things up with Vegas by introducing some decidedly awesome additions to the formula which changed the gameplay from a 'meticulous-plan-a-thon' into something closer resembling our aforementioned movie tape.      It achieved this in three main ways; firstly, by introducing the ability to stick and blind fire from any available cover in a third-person camera switch. Secondly it tantalized our retinas by running on the (then) brand spanking new Unreal 3 engine. And lastly, it gave us all the option of taking on an army of ludicrously armed terrorists using a bullet proof riot shield and a pistol large enough to emasculate Dirty Harry. The only conceivable down-side to all these stellar improvements was that Vegas didn't have a single Elvis impersonator hostage to save/ intentionally shoot. Trust us people, we searched everywhere.   So, here we all are just over a year after the release date of the original Vegas and we're already being presented with a full-priced sequel, Vegas 2. Initially we viewed this as both a good and a suspicious thing; 'good' because the first game left off with a television punching cliffhanger ending that needs some serious closure, and 'suspicious' because we've been hurt before by the less-than-amazing improvements in a similar quickly developed Tom Clancy sequel, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2.   Healthy suspicions aside, Vegas 2 kicks off well with a prequel level set five years before the chaotic events of the first game. Rather than playing as Logan Keller, the Texan accented bad arse of the original game, you are instead shoehorned into the combat boots of an elite Rainbow operative named Bishop who may be tailor made to any appearance via the P.E.C (persistent elite creation) tool - which was a major feature in Vegas' multiplayer mode. This prequel mission also includes an appearance by reckless new recruit Gabriel Nowak (the teammate who plays a major role in the tense ending of the first game) as he manages to screw the pooch on his inaugural mission. As interesting as this exposition is, once the crap hits the fan and the dust settles the plot fast forwards back to a parallel timeline with the Las Vegas insurgency portrayed in the last game.   Hmmm. Perhaps zebra camo wasn't the best choice in retrospect.  It is at this point in the proceedings, when your team is getting airlifted back into the familiar neon claws of 'Lost Wages', that you'll notice that the Vegas 2 experience hasn't exactly made leaps and bounds graphically. Fast roping out of our chopper and blitzkrieging through a handful of the missions, we could only discern two major differences from the original game. The first is quite obvious; the environments and the set piece firefights lean toward wider, open air areas - a design choice that will leave all you sniping fiends very, very happy. And the second visual difference is witnessed through a new realtime day/night cycle system  which coincidentally, was one of the 'much touted' improvements between GRAW and GRAW 2.    While we're speaking of borrowing things from the GRAW series, there is a greater focus on receiving more video uplinks through your HUD this time, which is an attempt to crossover the CrossCom system. This sounds fantastic in theory, but more often than not the uplink just pops up to badger your eyeballs like a possessed TiVo with a fetish for the CNN channel.     Before you tally up the sum of all your fears and tar Vegas 2 with that well used skepticism brush of yours, be aware that the gameplay formula has in fact seen some noticeable enhancement. At its core; you're still in control of a three man team, you still strategically kick in doors, and you're still looking for hostages to rescue and/or accidentally blind fire to death. - but this time around your superiors have given you some advanced spec ops schooling by training you to 'run' . Yes, tapping a button now imbues you with a limited burst of speed that opens up many scoot-and-shoot possibilities, not to mention the option to evade incoming grenades; which in Vegas was about as successful an undertaking as an elderly pedestrian avoiding an oncoming Ferrari Enzo.   The second shake up in Vegas 2 is the introduction of an 'Advanced Combat Enhancement and Specialization' system (ACES) which is an insanely verbose way of saying 'experience points'. Those among you who have extensively played Vegas' multiplayer mode will be in familiar territory here; essentially, every bad guy you bag will earn you XP that is organized into one of three different categories: Assault, Close-Quarter battle and Marksmanship. For example; perforating your way through an enemy's destructible cover and capping them in the process counts toward your assault XP, long range shots to a terrorist's noggin is Marksmanship XP, and blinding your victims with a flashbang and making them shake hands with your shotgun is Close Quarters XP. If you manage to max out a particular type of XP you'll be awarded with a specific item related to that skill. Surprisingly this system, along with the challenge of unlocking some of the crazier guns, is quite an addictive solution for spicing up the singleplayer experience.   Those darned terrorists and their palatial tropical villas! When will they learn?   Similarly the multiplayer has seen some enhancement that has taken the glorious online antics of the last game and polishes it up. The adversarial still has the tried and true 'take a hit and you're toast' intensity to it which made Vegas one of the best multiplayer romps on any next-gen console; and Ubisoft have built upon on this greatness by devising two new adversarial modes entitled Team Leader and Total Conquest.   Team Leader involves escorting a VIP to an extraction zone, or you may just opt to eliminate the other team altogether and win that way. Things get interesting here because opposing VIPs can plainly see each other on their HUD, and your vanquished team mates can respawn provided they aren't nailed by the opposing team leader. Lastly, Total Conquest requires one team to control three satellite dishes until a 30 second countdown has finished. All participating players can see the exact location of these satellites and what state they are in, because failure to control all three targets at once resets your team's timer. Needless to say, if you manage to play this mode without hearing one angry word screamed in your direction  you should go buy a lottery ticket.    No matter which multiplayer mode you're thrashing in Vegas 2, the old faithful strategies of Vegas have been changed thanks to the sprinting mechanic and the introduction of penetrable, destructible cover. With this new vulnerability in mind, being a hardcore gun nut when selecting your boomstick can mean the difference between assured victory, or six new breathing holes. The game embraces this idea by stocking the gun stable with eleven new weapons; our personal favourites being the machine pistol that doesn't shoot like a spray gun, a quick loading shotgun that is worth selecting, and the whisper-quiet silenced sniper rifle   Rainbow Six Vegas 2 is by no means the next evolutionary step in first person shooting, but it does wrap up the Vegas storyline quite nicely and the gameplay has seen some genuine, however incremental, improvement. Fans of the original should ante up and slide some moolah towards it, gamers who couldn't abide the previous game should cash in their chips and walk away, and newcomers to the series should have a flutter and get pleasantly surprised by a top-notch military shooter with killer multiplayer to boot.", "date": "Mar 19, 2008"}
