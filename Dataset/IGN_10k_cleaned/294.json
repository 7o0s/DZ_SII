The game's design, which is derived from the original Puyo Puyo game released about a decade ago, is based on the same mechanics as Tetris. Even so, the game is different enough to justify its existence, as well as the many incarnations the game has spawned over the years.  Features Puzzle Fight against the computer Test mode Link cable support for two player For NeoGeo Pocket Color  You might not have played this game with the same name, but the game has come to this country under many names  most notably Kirby's Avalanche on the Super NES and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine on the Genesis. Puyo Pop really isn't any different from those two versions of the game: you align two colored globs of glue as they fall into the pit, rotating them into four positions. When they fall into the bin, they'll link up with like colors. If four or more of the same color link together, they'll disappear and the rest of the globs will fall into the pit, possibly forming more links and chain reactions.   In Puyo Pop, you're fighting against different computer AI  you each have your own pit to worry about, and you each get the exact same pattern of globs to rotate and place.  If you form multiple chains that fall and disappear, you'll send piles of dead rocks over to your opponent  the bigger the chain reaction, the more rocks get dumped on your opponent. The only way you can get rid of these rocks is to create links on top of them  when the link disappears, so do the surrounding rocks. If your bin fills to the brim, it's game over.  Puyo Pop's one of the only puzzle games where I can actually see chain reactions forming as I build in the bin  unlike most puzzle games where chain reactions make you go, ~Did I do that?~. The strategy of creating multiple links is definitely key in mastering Puyo Pop, and it's an easy strategy to grasp.  The NeoGeo Pocket Color version is a straight-forward port from the Japanese version, down to the inaudible digitized Japanese speech when you form links, cause chain reactions, or do all weird and crazy things.  If you pick up this game, do yourself a favor and learn the game by playing it, not by reading the horrid instruction manual. SNK has to be the worst culprit of broken English in its documentation  and Puyo Pop has the worst reading instructions I've seen in a long time. It's enough to make your eyes water. Tetris still hasn't shown up on the NeoGeo Pocket Color yet, but Puyo Pop is easily the ~next best thing.~ This series of games has always been my favorite of the Tetris-style clones, and the NeoGeo Pocket Color version, apart from having a harsh interface for English language gamers, is an awesome edition of the Puyo Puyo series.", "date": "Oct 7, 1999"}
