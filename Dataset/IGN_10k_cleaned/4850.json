Multiplayer cellphone gaming is still a fledgling category, but that hasn't stopped the newcomer from taking on the tricky genre with its first salvo. We tried Momentum at E3 this year, and have now had a chance to play the final online with real people.   We're impressed.   Features:   Real-time multiplayer game  Six players at once  Lobbies for chatting  Eighteen in-game avatars   Momentum is a very simple game, which is probably its greatest asset. It's a maze game, where gamers roam randomly generated hallways, collecting coins and seeking the exit. The biggest catch is that five other players are also storming the labyrinth, trying to snatch up the coins and hit the exit before you. Without computer AI to blame loss on, Momentum is already a compelling play.   The title is technically a real-time game, but the way Momentum thwarts potential lag problems requires you to make decisions in advance. The game masks packet-sending by forcing you to choose paths before approaching corners. Red and blue arrows point in different directions. If you do not input a directional command before the end of the lead up, your character automatically heads with the blue arrow. It requires you to pay attention and keep looking ahead.   When you begin Momentum, you select from eighteen different animal avatars, such as monkeys and elephants. Once you reach the lobby, you join games or chat it up with other players. Then the game begins. The goal is to collect eight coins in the maze by walking over them. As soon as you have eight coins, your character's personal exit opens. Be the first to the exit and return to the chat room to gloat.   Now, there are five other players to contend with in the maze. If you cross paths in the maze with a player that has more coins than you, welcome to smashedville. Characters that have seven coins can smash all other players. Power-ups offer defense against other players, though, granting invisibility or shields.  Momentum is a very slick little game. It's not the most ~action~-filled title on handsets, but the chat room features, as well as mutliplayer gaming really makes it an important game on the wireless landscape. Blue Ridge has performed an impressive feat for an introductory title, and we're really looking forward to playing the company's next game.", "date": "Jul 20, 2004"}
