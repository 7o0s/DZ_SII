Some may argue that the size-restricting nature of the game cart design is to blame, but no matter what the reason, the lack of RPG support has really been a sore spot for Nintendo during the past few years.  Well it's time to stand up and cheer, RPG fans, because Atlus Software and series developer Quest have teamed up to deliver one of the first true RPG experiences on the starving system: Ogre Battle 64. Having played the game for many moons now, IGN64 is ready to bring you up to speed on the merits and shortcomings of this long-awaited title, and let us tell you right now: it has indeed been worth the wait.  Features  For one player 320 megabit cart (40 MB) Fantasy RPG gaming mixed with strategic and tactical elements Isometric sprite graphics with a 3D overworld map Tutorial mode for learning the basics Massive single player quest with engaging story and plot Branching quest variations depending on player choices and interactions Three save game slots via built-in EEPROM  Gameplay If you haven't yet read our preview coverage for this title, then you might have a few misconceptions and assumptions on what to expect from OB64. First of all, for any naysayers out there: this is most definitely an RPG. If your only concept of what defines an RPG comes from your experience with the Final Fantasy series, then prepare to expand your horizons with this game. You will of course find the standard genre elements such as experience points and item management, but this game offers something different as well. Fans of the classic Ogre Battle games on the SNES will feel very at home with this style of play, and newcomers will find it to be a fresh take on the sometimes repetitive Square titles.  So what can you expect? First, you may be surprised to learn that there will be no controlling of characters with the control stick. A minor point perhaps, but it sort of defines the way this game is played. The majority (if not all) of the game is played via menu manipulation. Think of this as a mix between the Final Fantasy series and Starcraft. You tell your units where to go by issuing commands to them like ~Move to this stronghold.~ Then they walk along the 3D landscape in route to their destination (represented by an animated 2D sprite) while the real-time clock is ticking away. While traveling, they might run into other characters, find objects in their path, or trigger a cut scene to further the tale. Upon arriving, you will then be able to issue other commands such as ~Enter Stronghold.~ The cool part about this is that unlike most standard RPGs, you do not simply control one party of warriors. Instead, you will end up having many parties, each walking around the 3D map in real-time as you attempt to flank your enemies and capture fortresses. This is the real-time/Starcraft element of the game that makes OB64 so truly unique to the console RPG realm.   Even once you enter a location such as a stronghold, there's no walking around and talking to characters. The only time character interaction occurs is during the in-game cutscenes and when a random neutral character is encountered on the main world map. In the case of the latter, a standard battle scene will initiate, but instead of fighting, the player is presented the command to ~talk~ to the newly encountered entity. It should be said that despite not having the ability to wander around towns and chat freely with non-playable characters, this game has a great amount of conversation in it. You can't help but feel pulled into the story, and that's mostly due to the fantastic cut-scenes that appear in all the right places.  When it comes to the battles in OB64, newcomers to the series might be surprised to learn that there is very little interaction or control by the player during combat. Imagine a typical Final Fantasy layout where all your troops are on the close side of the screen, and the enemy is on the far half. The backgrounds are all identical depending on what type of terrain you are fighting on, meaning all battles fought on grassy plains will have the same wonderful grassy plain background each time. But with as many different environments and locations as there are in this game, repetition should not be a problem whatsoever.  Now when the battle begins, your characters will begin attacking on their own, and defending the enemy attacks likewise without so much as a word from you. This is done in the standard ~run across the screen and slash him and run back into formation~ method of most current RPGs. What you are able to do, however, is issue what's called ~interrupt commands.~ These three commands are ~battle strategy~ (such as ~attack leader~ or ~attack weakest~), ~retreat,~ and ~Elem Pedra.~ A meter fills as the battle is fought, and each time it is filled you are able to issue one of the three commands. (For a detailed description of the battle system, see our previous analysis right here.) It doesn't seem to matter if you are actually the one controlling the attacks or not -- it's still great fun to watch your troops bring animated death and destruction to your opponents. In fact, it's almost more fun this way and less tedious than the FF style of gameplay.  Now besides the world map and battle screens, the other most common interface to learn in Ogre Battle 64 is the ~organize screen.~ This is where the game can really blow your mind and even overwhelm you with choices. The menus to learn can seem a bit complex at first, but once you run through the tutorial mode, even the most novice N64 players will be up to speed in no time. The first thing to know is that there are two sizes of characters in the game: normal (such as humans) and large (such as dragons). Next, like most RPGs, these characters have ~classes~ such as archer, cleric, dragon tamer, etc. You can give each character their own name, and even rename them at any time in the future. Each character is also equipped with their own weapons, shields, headpieces, clothing, spell books, etc., in true RPG fashion and giving them a wonderful sense of personality.  Now let's talk strategy. Characters are put into what's called ~units,~ with one character selected to serve as the ~unit leader.~ That's how you use characters in this game -- you put them into a unit, then from your main menu you can ~dispatch~ your unit to the world map. Then, as previously mentioned, you will issue commands to that unit such as where to move. Units are laid out in a 3x3 grid, having three rows per unit: front, middle, and back. Players can arrange up to five normal characters per unit, with large characters taking up an extra space on all sides. There is a ton of strategy involved in arranging your units within OB64. For example, if a character is placed on the back row of a unit, their attack might be different in style or strength than if it were positioned on the front row. You better place your toughest warriors up front, because the common sense rules of war apply here -- ground attacks must breach the first lines prior to attacking the archers and spell casters lurking in the back. Likewise, archers and wizards can attack enemies on any line of the ranks. Also, if an entire row has three soldiers or spell casters, it is possible that they will perform ~combined attacks~ when engaged in battle. These combined attacks depend on many factors such as the strength of their leader and the morale of the unit. Overall, the amount of strategy and planning involved before you even step out onto the world map is simply awesome, and if you have a thing for micro-management, this is definitely your game.   Indeed this game plays both incredibly realistic and incredibly deep. Those looking for some great tactical and strategic gaming will find that Ogre Battle 64 is sure to please. The controls are also very intuitive and highly functional at all times. Everything just seems to make sense when you reach for a particular button to bring up a menu or deselect a character. One thing to keep in mind for those who plan on playing the game: don't press the A,B, Z, and Start buttons simultaneously -- it resets the game.  Graphics Getting tired of chunky polygons cluttering up your screens? Ever find yourself pulling out your dusty SNES just to relive the glory days of beautiful artwork and sweet character animations? We can sympathize, and old-school gamers with a thing for that classic 2D look will be very happy with the visuals in OB64. The majority of the game is a pleasant combination of sprite-based scenery and only a few 3D elements, which are mixed-in very tastefully. Honestly, the point of the game is not to amaze you with eye-popping visuals. The Ogre Battle series just isn't about 3D effects, no matter what system it's created for. The addition of the third-dimension to this franchise simply allows you to scroll the world map around smoothly, and it serves its purpose most effectively.  But forget about 3D, Ogre Battle 64 is all about colorful characters and artistic scenery. And let's not forget about those wonderful sprite animations. Characters are animated beyond what you would expect them to be, and boy does it really bring the cutscenes to life. You'll see characters look directly at each other when talking, reach to open doors, bend to stand up while moving their chair, etc. Even the backgrounds are animated with moving details such as grass, bushes, fires, etc. The attention to graphical details goes a long way in this game and helps to achieve a quality cartoon feel throughout. The graphics are truly magnificent -- a pleasure to both watch and play.  Sound Fans of the classic games should be thrilled to know that much of the original music has returned to this 64-bit sequel. Quest is certainly not shy about staying true to the feel of its previous titles, as you'll be humming the traditional Ogre Battle theme the second you hit the title screen. And what a treat it is. While the midi-instruments are nothing special or even remotely close to the tunes achieved in the latest Zelda titles, the compositions and arrangements are as timeless and grandiose as ever. In fact, the music on OB64 is nearly identical to the SNES version, and fortunately that's not such a bad thing.  The sound effects are also nothing amazing, but they are rather fitting and work very nicely with the style of the game. Menus will pop and click with every press of the controller, and the battle sounds are very diverse and interesting. There are even some elements of dynamic music, as melodies and themes play when certain events transpire (such as a particular character appearing on-screen). Altogether, OB64 will manage to keep your ears very happy while your brain stews and plots the next strategic maneuver. It's really a shame that this title wasn't able to make it out of production sooner in the life cycle of the N64. Perhaps then other developers would have perked-up and realized that it only takes a little effort and talent, and they too could have to put together a quality RPG on this cart-based Nintendo system. But regardless, Ogre Battle 64 is finally available to the public, and we simply couldn't be happier. I can tell you right now what my plans are for the weekend -- turnout all the lights, grab a soda, and hit the couch for some more RPG goodness.If you simply can't stand menus, then be advised: this game may not be for you. You should at least give it a rent if you're remotely interested in RPGs. I'll bet that before long, you'll be running out to the store trying to scoop up the last remaining copy. Do yourself a favor now -- go get it. This game is very deep and wonderfully complex, and RPG fans simply shouldn't miss it.", "date": "Oct 6, 2000"}
