It's amazing to see how much debauchery a celebrity will engage in to make a dollar.  And Sammy knows all about cashing in on fame, pimping his name and image to 3DO this year in a not so subtle way.  Knowing 3DO's love for branding, it's nothing short of a miracle that they knew where to draw the line before we had to suffer through Sammy Sosa's Might and Magic VIII.  But there's always next season.  Created with ~mainstream~ gamers (the segment of the population that we still can't identify, but outspends us hardcore types four to one) in mind, Softball Slam is anything but a realistic simulation.  In an attempt to reach out to mass market audiences, whom publishers universally believe to be possessed of low IQ, the game looks and plays suspiciously like a Nintendo 64 title.  Character selection does nothing to alleviate doubts, as players pick from goofy male/female/coed teams like Metro Zoo, Buffy's Gym, Zippy Accountants, and Shorty's Diner.  Teams are filled with individuals of all shapes, colors, and sizes, each of whom is rated from 1 to 10 on power, accuracy, speed, fielding, throwing and pitching.  Why they even bother with the pretense of statistics is beyond me, however, since this game reminds me of a pop-up children's book -- shallow content hides behind a candy coated facade.  Strike one.  Softball can best be described as baseball's younger brother, and therefore it's a bit tamer than its sibling, but from the looks of things, 3DO lobotomized the kid.  Though you can bat, field, pitch and run the bases using a simple four-button control scheme, it's much easier to let the computer do it for you.  Smacking doubles, triples, and home runs is simple enough that a three-year-old kid could be packing in grand slams within minutes.  Because Softball Slam lacks any special effects aside from the flames which dance around a ball when it's going long or during a ~power throw,~ this title is 100% devoid of anything that would excite the player.  When the most action you can hope for is a female player getting scared of an incoming ball and cringing while one arm still holds up her glove, it's probably an indication that something's not clicking right with the design.  Strike two.  Several play modes are available, including Family, Single, and Tournament.  Family mode is the most basic, allowing you to pick a team, stadium (inner city, rural, suburbs, etc.), and time of day before hopping right into the action.  Playing a single game, you'll have more options in terms of setting the batting order, making substituions, and controlling the pace of the action.  Tournament matchups let up to eight players compete against a selection of computer teams, although there's no options for modem, LAN, or Internet play...what were they thinking?  I'd wager something along the lines of ~You want us to fit a product into THIS budget, boss? Hahaha, that's a good one!~  Even the league editor reeks of unfulfilled potential, allowing you to create players using only the limited selection of models and facial features provided.  To avoid an embarrassing lawsuit against IGN, I'm going to refrain from commenting on the omnipresent option to instantly transform any male player into Sammy Sosa.  Strike three.  Because Softball Slam is supposed to be an arcade game, you'd think that at least a few dollars would have been pumped into the graphics.  What we're treated to instead are the third rate, sparsely detailed players who couldn't make the cut for High Heat Baseball.  Stadium textures for both daylight and nighttime settings are displayed in a low resolution and look all the worse for it.  The only aspect of the visuals worth bragging about are the character animations, which appear to be fluid and natural.  But getting to watch a player wield their bat like a ninja sword or take a drink, throw away the cup, and let out a long belch isn't considered much of a treat.  If ever a product was crying out -- and we're talking SCREAMING here -- for the over the top, blooper intensive action, this is the one.  Yeeeeeeeeee're Ouuuuuuuuuut!  Call the Valium people, I think we've got a winner.  Sammy Sosa Softball Slam isn't FDA approved, but it'll knock you out faster than any drug on the market.  Action oriented sports games are meant to be playful, lighthearted, and heavy on the visual stimulation, but this title bats .000 on all counts.  Why waste your money when a fastball to the head is just as effective?  -- Scott Steinberg", "date": "Apr 27, 2000"}
