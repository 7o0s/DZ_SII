This game has bored me into a stupor, so if I start rambling or you see me repeating sentences or something, try to forgive me. When I first picked this game up, I was thinking, ~Woohoo, another roller coaster game! I love Roller Coaster Tycoon and Sim Theme Park! I'm gonna love this game! Roller coasters are nifty!~ Boy was I wrong... Apparently roller coasters are boring. And ugly. And annoying.  You would figure after having games like RCT and Sim Theme Park to model after that a new roller coaster designer would pick up some tips and maybe even improve a little on the designs in those games. But no, they went the opposite direction and took everything that was good and either removed it or made it worse. 3D Roller Coaster Designer turned out to barely be a game at all.  Basically, you open the box and find the CD hiding inside with absolutely no manual at all. Luckily there is a read-me file that explains the controls that you can print out. But it isn't like it really matters anyway, because once you load the game up, you be plopped not into a menu system as you may think, but right into the game. That's because there are no options for you to choose outside of building the coaster, placing different textures on the ground, surrounding mountains, and sky, placing plants, and coloring all those different things.  There are three different coaster types for you to design in the game: wooden, steel, and steel inverted. And in each of these coaster types, there are twenty different pieces that you can choose from to construct your ride. You may be thinking that is a lot, but you would be wrong. The coasters are divided into three levels; the ground level, the middle level, and the high up in the air level. You may have noticed that those aren't really official labels. Basically what that means is that flat spaces of track can only be laid out on those three elevations. And they have separate pieces for each of these elevations. So the twenty pieces for each track includes three straight pieces of track for each elevation, three curved pieces for each elevation, three inclines to go from the ground to each level... You get the picture. Basically what this does is restrict your building incredibly where a game like Roller Coaster Tycoon gives you a huge range of motion and design possibilities just through the building interface. And perhaps one of the most annoying things in the game is the inability to run your coaster through mountains. Sure, your track can go into the mountains, but you won't get a tunnel so your cars will run smack into the side of a rock. Great...    Once you managed to build your roller coaster, you can start adding in the extras. But don't worry that won't take very long because there aren't many extras and the ones that are there are boring as hell. All you have to stick in the background is a few trees and one kind of rock. All of these can be scaled differently. Once you placed some enormous Yucca plants and Pine trees in the mix you can place ground, mountain and sky textures which are really kinda sad. It looks as though the art team didn't even care about the scale of the textures. There is a ground texture made to look like the cracked earth found in hot and dry places like Death Valley. Unfortunately the texture makes the coasters look toys.  The one thing that is nice about the game is that once you have finished your coaster, you test it, get a score based on some nameless scale, and then you can actually take a seat in the coaster and ride the sucker around. It's always something I wished I could do on my coasters in RCT. Yeah, that's pretty much the only thing that I like about the game, if you can really call this a game. That's all there is to it  Conclusion: don't go buy this game. You could have a lot more fun by grabbing a game like Roller Coaster Tycoon that allows for a ton of roller coaster designs or if you like the ability to ride your coaster at the end, you can grab Theme Park which does that. The main point is that this game just doesn't have any character. At all. It's soulless. This game is worth up to five dollars at the most, and you'll be getting so much more bang for your buck if you go out and spend that extra ten dollars on the better game.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
