But for reasons unclear, Konami went back to the game to produce NHL Blades of Steel 2000. Maybe having the 2000 at the end of the title just looks cool  apart from the slightly quicker speed and updated rosters, this game is darn near identical to the Blades of Steel release from last year. And while that's certainly not a bad thing overall, it just means there's really no reason to pick up this game if you have last year's release. Features: NHL and NHLPA license Practice, Exhibition, and Season Modes Fights and Penalty Shot mini-games  Battery back-up Infra-red support to trade players Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Color   NHL Blades of Steel 2000 is based on last year's version of NHL Blades of Steel, which is tightly based on the NES version of Blades of Steel on the Nintendo Entertainment System in the mid-80s. Despite its five-on-five design, this is not a simulation. Realism has been thrown out the window to provide a maniacal ice hockey experience. There are no fouls other than an icing call, and even then it's very rare to have the play stop. The only real penalty is during fights  if you lose the fist brawl, you get sent to the box and the other team gets the powerplay. What a concept  being rewarded for fighting. I wonder if the NHL knows about this little feature...  Gameplay, like mentioned above, is extremely fast. It's so fast that forget about sitting back and setting up plays  your task is to simply get the puck down your end of the ice and pass or shoot it into the net. Since there's no penalties in trying to get the puck, you're allowed to slam the other guy down to the ice to steal it. Aiming the puck is a simple task of looking at the arrow bouncing up and down behind the goalie  just hit the A button to send the puck in that location. But the other player can maneuver the goalie to block the hole, so it's not that easy to score  but you can certainly exploit your buddy's incompetence if he's not working his goalie fast enough.  That's right, you can play against your buddy. Like last year's version, NHL Blades of Steel 2000 has link-cable support. Climax, the game's developer, has done an outstanding job on this feature  even though the game has to keep track of 10 players, two goalies, and a puck, Blades of Steel never slows down or gets out of sync. Unlike Konami's NBA In the Zone 2000, NHL Blades of Steel 2000 in link-up mode isn't a slower version of the one-player game. It's just as fast, and feels like your opponent is there on the same system. The only downside is that you can't play the Practice Mode in link-up, which means no fights or penalty shootouts outside of the regular game.  But the game isn't without its problems -- it doesn't look like the season mode was tested very well (or at least, our cartridge might have a glitch or two in it), because the interface gets all screwy when I tried getting into it. Points off her  I don't have a problem with the mode mucking up since I'm just a jump-in-and-play type person. But there are tons of you hockey fans that totally dig playing a full season -- and the features are here, if you can get through the glitchy programming. Is NHL Blades of Steel 2000 a good game? Yes. Is it better than the first one? Slightly. Is it worth buying if you've got last year's version? No way. As much as I like playing the faster version of Blades of Steel, I can't recommend this to people who already have NHL Blades of Steel 2000. It's faster in speed, but that's really it. A tweak in the graphics during a goal, and the addition of the Atlanta Thrashers. Anything else? Nope. Great stuff for a Game Boy Color game, but not enough to justify a whole new purchase.", "date": "Apr 29, 2000"}
