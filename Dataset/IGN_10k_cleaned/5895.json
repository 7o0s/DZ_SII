With all the ~Episode III~ madness, it's nice to see a return visit from the franchise's most woefully under-developed villain.   Star Wars Lightsaber Combat has a very limited scope. All you do is fight with Darth Maul. Considering that you must fight him at least twice in each of the eight levels, that means no fewer than sixteen brawls where only the backdrop and the difficulty changes. Move sets are stagnant. What you have from the beginning is all you're gonna get, so if you can't swing with your jumping strikes, foot-sweepers, or full-frontal attacks -- too bad.   (Nevermind the silliness that you chop Darth Maul up at the end of each victorious round, only to have the Sith Lord return all patched-up. At least in Street Fighter, enemies were just knocked out.)   Star Wars Lightsaber Combat maps all of its controls to the number pad. In order to access some attacks, like the jumping strike, you must fumble with three number keys -- move forward, then jump, then attack: 9, 5, then 3. Sometimes it feels like you're just mashing buttons to get the job done and any victory is accidental. That's not very fun. However, after several sessions with the game, I started to get the hang of things and was doing backflips to retreat, only to lunge forward and catch Maul off his guard with a flying strike. Little moments like that are kinda cool, especially when you see that developer Topgam was paying attention to the different Jedi stances.   I DL'd the game on a Sony Ericsson 710a, and it was interested to see that the game doesn't take up the whole screen. The action was relegated to the bottom half the screen with a ~Star Wars~ logo on the top. This is kind of a forced letterboxing, giving the action a wider field. The only drawback is that this relegates the sprites to a small size and strips out some detail. The animation is a little frame-y, too, but I did like the blood spurts when you make contact.   Oh, and the sound absolutely sucks. Man, is it bad.  There are better ~Star Wars~ games on the Cingular deck right now -- and you are better off downloading them before this sub-standard little fighter. Might I recommend the Revenge of the Sith game or Battle Above Coruscant? They have better music, better art, and much better game play. However, if you absolutely must play with a digital Darth Maul, this looks like your only option thus far. Sorry.", "date": "Jul 23, 2005"}
