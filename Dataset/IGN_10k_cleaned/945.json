Electronic Arts' FIFA series has captured the videogame soccer audience in such a way that all fussball games released must be measured by its standards. Along comes Striker Pro 2000 from Infogrames and Rage, the latest soccer title to challenge (ha!) FIFA's stronghold on the market. Will it supplant the title? No, not even if it was the second coming of Pele. Can it compete with the title on a basic gameplay level? Now that's a different story.   Carrying the UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) stamp and no nod (of course) from FIFA, Striker Pro 2000 does many things FIFA does, and does several of them better. The focus of the two games is decidedly different. Whereas FIFA runs the gamut, providing international, European club and now even MLS teams, UEFA specializes in European club teams. Is this a drawback? Only if you're expecting to play as Casey Keller or Kobe Jones. But it does provide for less recognition for an already uneducated US audience.   Gameplay Recognition ultimately may not be that important. If a game is challenging and fun, who cares (besides purists) if you're playing with Alexi Lalas or Jurgen Klinsman? That being said...is this game fun? Yes. Is it challenging? Yes.   Striker Pro 2000 benefits from a smooth, easily mastered control structure. On offense, X passes, square shoots, circle sends a through ball and triangle completes a cross. The most useful feature here is the through ball, excellent for setting up goals while attacking. This is a great button option, much better than designating the triangle to speed burst. Here, running faster is accomplished simply by holding R1. This is another great use of the controller. It feels a lot better to hold down a button (while still manipulating the others) than to tap repeatedly for a speed boost.   On defense, the controls are a bit clunkier. R1 still causes the player to sprint, but the other controls are less intuitive. X causes the player to implement a stand-up tackle in the direction of the ball. Circle is a stand-up tackle in the view direction, according to the instruction manual. The first button apparently causes the defender to lunge at the ball. The second causes him to lunge in the direction he is facing. Neither prove to be very effective. Square is your standard slide tackle, but the animation is slow and it often results in a foul. Luckily, the computer's defensive AI is pretty sharp, but more on that in a bit.   The biggest downfall to defensive control is the weird system Rage has designed to handle marking men. Instead of giving full control to the player on the X button (as it has been for practically every soccer, hockey, football and basketball game since the system's inception), SP2K switches the control of players for you. Oddly enough, the computer performs this function in a remarkably intuitive fashion.  Frequently, I found myself looking to press the button just as the marker switched.   However, there's just something a bit unsettling about not even being given a viable option to control a player cutting to the goal or a defender supporting the marking defender. There is an ultra-complicated way of switching players, but involves pressing and holding L1 while pushing the D-pad in the direction of the player you'd like to control. This is impossible to pull off, especially as a striker is streaking past you to goal.   If you can get over this detail, the game plays very smoothly. The flow of the game is similar to European soccer, and each club has its own personality and style of play. In fact, the attention to realism is apparent throughout the game. Players twist and dive for headers, flick the ball on, make runs.   For the American market, this game may be just a bit too realistic. I'm not knocking the die-hard soccer fans out there. I'm talking about the people who learned all that they know about the sport from playing the video game. Soccer is not an arcade-style sport. It is a sport of bursts and strategy, of lucky bounces and missed opportunities. And the nature of the game is reflected in the score. For those used to racking up dozens of goals, this isn't the game for you.   The reason? The AI in this game is quite good, and the goalies are stellar. Computer-managed players mark well, read passes, and are quite skilled at tackling. On your own team, you can lean on your defense if you get burned. For the most part, they are quite able to pick up the pieces. This is a decided improvement over FIFA 2000, whose same-side computer-operated defenders would do everything but mark a man in the box. It's a simple concept, and Rage gets it right.   However, if there is a fault across the board, it is that the AI defenses play too far up. This leads to chances for a single player to make it behind the defense, providing multiple breakaways per contest. Fortunately, the goaltenders in this game are up to their world-class billings. Fluid and dynamic, the goalie animations are realistic and well-duplicated. When a goalie makes an amazing save, it looks like an amazing save. He doesn't simply leap up in the air, then float horizontally to magically pluck the ball from the air. He's giving it everything he's got to get to the ball.   Graphics Across the board, player movement looks natural. In special situations (bicycle kicks and heel passes especially), the animations are sensational.   As for the rest of the graphics, they are passable but not spectacular. They certainly don't get in the way. The best way to describe them, in fact, is that they are very utilitarian. They get the job done.   One unique feature (and I still haven't decided if it is cool or not) is the replay, which mimics the controls on a VCR. Jog your winning goal back and forth, pause and rewind. When you do so, interference lines come across the screen as if you were actually viewing the replay on video. While this may look neat, there is no real way to see a clear shot of exactly what happened. Even the pause contains lines through it. Apparently Rage has not been exposed to anything above a two-head VCR.   Striker Pro 2000 allows you to play teams in an exhibition with Friendly match. Or, play a league season, knockout tournament or classic match. Compete for the Super Trophy with your favorite squad. In addition, use the training mode to unlock other contests, including National Team Quals, National Team Finals and the Territories Cup. Lots of modes make for generous helpings of competition and challenge.   The Training Mode enables you to practice your skills in many different kinds of situations. This is not only useful but fun. The training is structured like a mini-game, and is actually rewarding when you score high marks. Each training session can be taken as simply practice, or an attempt at a certificate. Accumulate certificates to unlock new game modes.   Further features include the Game Editor, which enables you to edit custom teams. Build a franchise from the ground up, designing your team all the way down to facial hair, shirt color and complexion. Or, just tweak a team that already exists, perhaps placing you among the ranks of the soccer elite. The Game Editor is a great feature, and keeps par with the same features in FIFA.All told, Striker Pro is probably an inferior game to FIFA. But it has its merits: 130 teams, mostly great gameplay and unmatched realism. Will it contend in the future? In some ways yes, in some ways, no. It's definitely worth your while.", "date": "May 23, 2000"}
