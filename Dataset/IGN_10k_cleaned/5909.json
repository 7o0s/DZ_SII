And to be honest, that was the development team's intention from the very beginning -- to meld the oddball humor of Laharl and company with the complex mechanics of Marona and her legion of inert objects. The end result is something a little less focused than the both of them, but its strategic and entertainment values are undeniable.   Produced once again by the modern-day masters of strategy, Nippon Ichi, Makai Kingdom is certainly aimed in the opposite direction of the casual gamer. If you've never played a tactical RPG before and are curious about what the genre has to offer, then perhaps this isn't the starter kit you're looking for (that honor still goes to the original Advance Wars on the GBA). Fans of the previous NIS games, however, will probably go bonkers over this new experience as Makai Kingdom offers the most personality and humor of the series since Disgaea first rebooted the genre with its absurdity in 2003.   In fact, in many ways it's the characters (and to a lesser extent, the storyline) of Makai Kingdom that steals the show. Following the adventures of Lord Zetta (the most powerful frickin' overlord in the universe), Chronicles of the Sacred Tome is all about redemption... or at least, about as much redemption as a demonized ruler of the Netherworld can expect. When our story begins, Zetta is actively seeking out an ancient book that his fellow overlord and prophetic oracle known as Pram predicted would end his existence (and his empire). Being the proactive guy that he is, Zetta finds the Tome before it can come to him and attempts to destroy it. Needless to say, the gung-ho scheme doesn't exactly work out as planned and Zetta's entire dimension is completely destroyed... but not before he confines his soul to the Tome in a last ditch effort to survive. From that point on, the game really gets going and follows Zetta in his attempt to get his kingdom back and once again become the premier power in all of creation.   Expect to see plenty of funny little scenes like this along the way. As I pointed out before, Zetta's trip is bursting with interesting and funny characters. My personal favorite is the Dark Lord Valvoga -- a super-powerful combination of three different entities that's stylistically reminiscent of Kefka from the end of Final Fantasy VI (it's even joked that he is commonly hired by game makers to star as the ~Final Boss~ in numerous projects). What makes Valvoga so intriguing, though, is that it's powered by two sadistic and bloodthirsty lesser parts and headed up by an effeminate and spineless weakling named Micky. Almost every line of Micky's dialogue ends up being hilarious too, as his interactions with other characters provides plenty of reasons to genuinely smile and laugh out loud.   The remaining players and their conversations are just as beguiling -- with Zetta himself, Pram, Overlord Seedle, and a host of other performers all doing their part towards making Makai Kingdom a humorous and enjoyable little experience. Even the created NPCs that populate your hub world make snide and amusing comments when you speak to them, and the voice-acting that supports the main characters is done extremely well (the English track exceeds all previous Nippon Ichi American dubs and the Japanese track kicks all ass). I do have to admit that I still prefer Disgaea's plot and cast just a little bit more to this one, but at least Chronicles of the Sacred Tome doesn't take itself too seriously like the last game from NIS did (Phantom Brave).   As referenced earlier, Makai Kingdom is very much the amalgam of Phantom Brave and Hour of Darkness -- borrowing the character creation setup and acerbic wit of Disgaea and combining it with the grid-devoid movement system and a variation on Phantom Brave's Confine mechanic. The ultimate result is something that's a lot more similar to traditional strategy RPGs than the more freeform games of Nippon Ichi's past. Fans of Ogre Battle and Final Fantasy Tactics: I'm looking at you.   What this means in more specific terms is that Phantom Brave's Phase Battle turn system has been replaced in favor of the classic turn-based mechanic that most SRPG players are used to. Items and accessories no longer need to be leveled up either, so whatever you buy from a merchant retains the same use no matter when you decide to equip it. Compulsive level grinding and heavy character customization isn't encouraged as heavily this time around either, as  Makai Kingdom is more about figuring out the strategy of a stage's design than powering your fighters up high enough to plow through a randomly-generated dungeon.    This straight-ahead approach doesn't mean that Makai Kingdom isn't without depth and its own specific line of gimmicks, though. The enemy AI, for example, is much more aggressive than any of Nippon Ichi's other PS2 tactics games, and the requirements for creating user-spawned environments by which to easy-level your character is a lot stricter than before. After all, hardcore players of both Phantom Brave and Disgaea can tell you that given enough time it was easy to abuse each game's many systems to create super-powerful boss-killers rather quickly. This meant that if you wanted to be insistent about it, you could easily hop into an Item World or a Random Dungeon and grind your way up high enough to breeze through the story-oriented levels.   This time around, however, you'll have to spend oodles of Mana points (a type of secondary currency earned by defeating various foes) in order to create new random dungeons that are also capped by the level of your highest character. When taken together, these two factors make abusing party advancements a difficult thing to do. Random Invite and Item limitations and the fact that user-created dungeons are difficult to escape and disappear after they've been traveled through further punishes would-be god-makers.   While this balancing fix may appeal to some, I actually miss the ability to construct ultra-powerful party members that deal 20,000 hit points of damage with every strike. For me, a lot of the fun in Nippon Ichi SRPGs has been spending a lot of my leisure time creating ber warriors that nobody ever wants to mess with. Of course, with incredibly high level character caps and plenty of secret dungeons to traverse, you can still accomplish that kind of feat if you really want to... but it takes a lot longer to get to level 100 now than it did before (which makes Makai Kingdom feel a little less outrageous than what I expected from a typical NIS experience. I don't know, maybe it's just me).   Vehicles add a lot of strategy (and fun) to Makai Kingdom's epic battles. Despite the slower level building, there is a silver lining to all this: Makai Kingdom actually forces you to use your brain and use honest to goodness strategy in order to defeat your opponents. Using the environment and carefully choosing which enemies to eliminate first is probably at its highest level of importance since Disgaea. If you leave Death Sabers unscathed in the early goings of a map, for example, you can forget about being around to complete it. Failing to kill an ~Invite~ enemy before it requests backup can seriously ruin your plans as well, and forgetting to position your characters in the proper places can often mean the difference between safety and long-range death.   Pram, a hottie overlord and oracle. Chronicles of the Sacred Tome also benefits from the Confine variation mentioned before (known as ~Invite~), which allows you to create new characters from inanimate objects. The cool thing about this is that it gives you an incentive to seek out new items to create better characters (and gives you a reason to keep going back to the stages other than to level grind... albeit slowly). But that's just scratching the surface of what the new Invite system is actually capable of, as the real meat of the mechanic is focused on the use of vehicles and structures. With vehicles, you'll earn the ability to cover more ground in a single turn, select from a higher number of high-powered attacks, and use its extra space to gain extra strikes before a turn is over by cleverly dispatching your characters. Don't worry about selection either, there are enough transports to go around -- with basic tanks like the Gear Metal Lex and Driller G to more complex and unusual machines such as the CX1 Hellpha and the TX5 Hopster.   The real fun, though, comes with the various structures that you can build and take with you into battle. In addition to basic bonuses to your attributes and various privileges earned outside of warfare, they're also the best way to cheat your eight character limit and get extra combatants on the map. They make for a great way of saving a near-dead character and replacing him with a fresher one, and also pump up your end-level results with score bonuses and extra experience. My favorite thing to do with a facility, however, is to attack one that belongs to an enemy so that it kills anything and everything housed inside it. If you can plan this correctly, it can bring an otherwise difficult stage to an abrupt end.    As cool as all these gameplay features are, there are a couple of things that really bug me. For one, the lack of a grid to move around poses the same problem in Makai Kingdom as it did in Phantom Brave... that is, targeting specific enemies (especially long-range ones) can prove difficult to do when they're grouped together with their guys or your own. The targeting cone also suffers because of this, since its three-dimensional effect radius is dependant on where you place your marker. This means that you can expect an awful lot of repositioning, map spinning, and other recurring movements when using several of the different characters.   Additional housekeeping gripes include a tendency for units to literally walk over each other for an unintentional stacking effect (you can forget about landing melee attacks properly when this happens) and a somewhat sloppy interface that makes equipping characters for battle more of a chore than a convenience. Honestly, though, these little nitpicks aren't so bad when taking in the grand scheme of things, but after hundreds of hours with Nippon Ichi's strategy / RPGs over the years, these bothersome moments become increasingly noticeable and less forgiving.   The same could be said for Makai Kingdom's visual presentation as well. On par with its other PS2 cousins, the graphics are still 2D sprites with low-res resolutions and uninspired backgrounds. It can be charming the first time and maybe even the second, but four games into the PlayStation 2's lifecycle with little change in quality is a signal to me that it's time for NIS to do what Capcom did for Street Fighter III... increase that onscreen pixel count. The character designs, however, are strong as ever.Longtime RPG fans will probably come to the same conclusion about Makai Kingdom: Chronicles of the Sacred Tome that I have: that as impressive as it may be, its lack of growth in certain areas (the visual presentation and targeting/navigational hitches specifically) are becoming less and less tolerable as time goes on. They're not the end of the world mind you, but they should definitely be addressed for the next inevitable installment to keep the momentum going.Makai Kingdom's colorful cast of characters.Despite those concerns, however, Makai Kingdom is probably the deepest and most giving RPG to hit the PlayStation 2 all year. With character customization that can only be eclipsed by its predecessor Phantom Brave, and a more balanced approach to strategy when compared to any of the NIS' prior games, Zedda's little adventure gives fans plenty to talk about. The humorous characters and their excellent voice-over work is worth a lot as well, and when you throw in a ton of replay goodies like Reincarnations, secret characters, hidden dungeons, multiple endings, and a New Game Plus feature, Makai Kingdom is a no-brainer for genre fans. Just don't expect anything too revolutionary.", "date": "Aug 5, 2005"}
