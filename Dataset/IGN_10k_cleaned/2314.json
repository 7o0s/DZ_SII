Tucked into a corner of Sony's kiosk for online games were four copies of the game, and a pair of headphones attached to each of them. There was nobody waiting to play the game, so I sauntered over, slipped on the headphones... and promptly lost three hours. I missed appointments, forgot about lunch; nothing existed outside that game. I still didn't realize I was hooked, though, until I did it the next day. And the next. This, my friends, is digital crack in the purest sense.  Gameplay Like any other addiction, the attraction starts out simply. There isn't a lost to Frequency on the surface. You fly down a tunnel that contains the major parts of a song (drums, bass, guitar, synth, vocals, etc.), and play the corresponding track by hitting indicators on the left, middle or right side. If you can nail every note in the sequence, you'll lock in that section of the song, and you're free to move on to other parts of the song. If you can get all the tracks in a section, you'll open up the freestyle scratch and axe tracks, which let you use the left analog stick to freestyle a little turntable scratchage or the astonishingly cool axe for custom synth notes. Higher difficulties obviously have more difficult patterns to play, but that's the gist of it.   Once you're spoon-fed a bit of the delicious music making stew for a while, you'll begin to notice that making the music sound good is completely up to you, so as you fly through the song, you can start building it as you like, say starting with the bass line, then moving on to guitar, then drums, then sliding in vocals. It's about that time when you toss the spoon to the ground and dive head first into the cauldron cooking all the stew. The addiction just spirals out of control from there. Once you start learning to chain together pieces of the song into combos, and learn how to strategically utilize the multiplier (just as it sounds, it boosts your score for 8 measures) and autocatcher (automatically grabs all the notes on a track, giving you the points), you're truly lost.   And then comes the realization that you can rip these songs apart and make something completely different with the remix mode. That's right, you can rearrange the music as you see fit, adding in different beats and layers according to what sounds right to your ears. Essentially the exact same as the game, you fly down the tunnel with each of the sections opened up, then you just freestyle, laying down a pattern. You can freestyle the whole length of one section (about 8 measures), or you can lay down a beat and then loop it until the end of the section. The game locks the rhythm down into place so everything glides around with the beat, and you're set. Once you have your pattern, you can apply a myriad of effects, from a stutter to echo to chorus, and each of them sounds remarkably good. Should you want your song to sound something like the original, you can activate the guides that'll give you an idea how the original went with placeholder images where you can lay down the beat.   It's hard to describe, but incredibly easy to pull off. Rather than try to explain, I'll just let you listen to something I did in about 15 minutes. It shows how easy it is to make the music, but how hard it is to actually make it sound GOOD.   It's also important to point out that the multiplayer modes rock. Up to 4 players at once can get their split screen on, trying to capture a measure of a track at a time. The autocatcher powerup that you'll find in the solo game is here, but added to it are the freestyler (turns the track into an axe or scratch track), crippler (disables an opponent's activator so they can't nail any notes), neutralizer (negates any work on that track that an opponent has done, along with their points) and bumper (shoves an opponent backward).   The powerups keep things heated, and it's just fun to hear a bunch of different parts of the song fleshing out at once as opposed to just your work.   Graphics If ever there was a game designed to reel in the candy ravers, this is it. Sure, Sega's Rez is a lock for the LSD crowd, but Frequency heaps on a look that's something like the computer world of Tron thrown into pastel color overdrive. Everything has that clean, precise, angular look that you'd imagine inside a computer, but there's an eruption of color all around. Each of the game's eight arenas don't change the music in any way, but they do offer some wild background visuals for anyone watching the game with you. (One of the downsides to the harder difficulties is that you don't really have time to enjoy anything visual outside the tracks you're working on.)  It's odd, but there's not much to say about the graphics. Sure, they're trippy and entertaining, but largely they're just filler to complement -- gasp -- the gameplay. Each of the areas offers some combination of a couple of things: a) The sensation that you're flying through space either incredibly fast or very slowly, b) Animated textures circling around the tunnel, c) Polygonal shapes floating in space alongside or around the tunnel. Of course, there's more, but for the first time I find myself at a lost to describe the look, and more primed to talk about the music. The apocalypse must be upon us.  Sound Good Lord, it's a good thing this game's music is so good. Sure, it's a given that music game without good music would suck, but beyond that, even getting good songs that didn't break down properly would have been odd. Luckily, each and every one of Frequency's songs easily sounds good in part, and amazing in whole, especially when you've layers all the different tracks yourself, and you're able to hear each part coming together. It's long been a trick of DJs - and primarily house or trance ones - to let the music drop out and then slowly rebuild the song piece by piece. When a human hears the different parts coming together along with a nice crescendo and a quickening bass drum, it makes it so much more emotional. Lucky you, you have the ability to do this yourself with the aforementioned remix mode.  Frequency knows no one genre. The music you'll hear in the game is, of course, tinged with some element of electronica, but not all of it is 4/4 beat house music. There's trace, drum n' bass, turntables, big and break beat and house, but you'll also find some hip-hop, electronic and even industrial rock. Let's put it this way, here's who's music you'll be bobbing or banging your head to: Paul Oakenfold, Orbital, The Crystal Method, DJ QBert, BT, Dub Pistols, Lo Fidelity Allstars, Ethan Eves, Freezepop, No Doubt, Fear Factory, Orbit, Akrobatik, Powerman 5000, Curve, Roni Size & Reprazent, Meat Beat Manifesto, Funkstar De Luke, Juno Reactor, Jungle Brothers, The Symbion Project, Toni Trippi, DJ HMX and Komput Kontroller.   I listed all the artists not to fill space, but to show exactly how wide a span the music genres actually cover. If you can stomach electronic music, you'll find something to like here. It's scary that groups like Fear Factory and No Doubt can be remixed into sounding absolutely, positively at home next to Oakenfold and Orbital or QBert and The Crystal Method. Not one of the songs in the game seems out of place. Even the stuff that was created by Harmonix sounds fantastic when put up against the big names in the biz.  When it comes down to it, this is just an amazingly good game. I haven't met anyone yet that hasn't been completely engrossed within five minutes of picking up the controller and going to town, especially when you factor in the multiplayer and remix modes. On the harder difficulty levels, it can take literally dozens of tries just to nail a particular part in a song, but the rewards of some of the later level music makes it all worth it. Techno and electronica nuts will absolutely eat this up, but it's simplistic enough that even casual or non-gamers will be able to get into the music with just a little practice.This also happens to be one of the best games to unleash on unsuspecting friends and family during a get-together because it is so easy to pick up and play. Pick up a copy and turn it loose on your loved ones this Christmas; I'm willing to bet even your anti-video game relatives will get sucked in. And that's what it all boils down to. Frequency is easy to play, incredibly fun, and appeals to a wide variety of musical tastes. Run out and get this game as soon as you can, you'll thank us later.", "date": "Nov 27, 2001"}
