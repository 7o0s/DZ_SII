{"name": "Mad Dash Racing", "name_review": "Mad Dash", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/11/21/mad-dash", "text": "Crystal Dynamic's sorta exploring, sorta running, sorta flying, all racing game is definitely a unique rethinking of a genre that's been driven into the grave by copycat syndrome. Technically it's a Cart racing game like Mario Kart or Crash Racing -- at least that's the closest comparison. The racing physics are incredibly light, the focus is on weapons and shortcuts, and the speed is kept crazy, and of the ~on the edge of your seat~ variety. Like most cart racers, your buttocks will never sit more than two inches into your seat in a race.  What makes Mad Dash different, though, is that you're racing on legs, instead of on wheels, so that you're free to jump, glide, bash and dash your way through levels that are much crazier, and more eclectic. You'll find yourself running up ropes, using catapults, sliding down giant tubes, and through gears and spikes in a matter of minutes, using your character's special abilities to open up special secret shortcuts along the way. Depending on what character you choose, you'll be able to glide across gaps, dash up steep slopes, and bash through breakable objects, each of which gives you the chance to gain a few crucial seconds on the competition -- not to mention, check out cool secret parts of the levels. You get to pick your skills, you get to choose your route, and it's up to you to make it happen. Mad Dash promises to give you your own custom racing experience, as well as introduce a new way to take on your friends in multiplayer. But does it deliver?  Gameplay  It's actually what you expect -- arcade, fast, frenetic, and fun. There are some rough spots in the way you play, like getting characters around corners, but most of your gripes will come with the fact that you're playing people with feet -- well at least paws and hooves anyway -- not carts with wheels. Because of that, there's a lot less technique involved in the game, and more of a focus on finding the shortcuts. It's the key to your success, and your main source of fun in the game. Unlike most racers, it's the levels that take the focus in this game, not the characters themselves. While this ultimately hurts the game in the end because of a lack of gameplay depth, it's also part of what gives it its unique charm. You're not just racing around tracks, you're not just using practiced techniques on new environments, you're learning new levels and figuring out their tricks and traps, similar to a platformer. The downside is that once you've figured out the best routes, the actual running through the levels, the actual racing of this racing game, loses a lot of its charm.  A couple of people around the office have criticized that the game's levels are a bit too large (they normally range from three to five minutes, and that's with no repetition), but personally I'm impressed with the mileage you put into each area of the game. Since you've got around 10 levels to explore, the fact that they've made them this large, and filled them with tons of shortcuts and secret routes for the different racing types gives them a larger scope than you'd expect. The gameplay's still kept simple, but at least you're rewarded for exploring the intricacies of each environment -- which will take you a while, considering how many variations there are on the already massive races. The variation also tends to keep things fresh, especially because the variety of tasks chances drastically, from grabbing some key rails to get you past some water, or jumping from swimming to running to hand over hand in a matter of moments. So maybe twirling the right stick to climb and swim isn't exactly the most fun thing to do in a game -- it's an homage to Track and Field, and you've gotta respect that. I'm not kidding! RESPECT IT!  It can be argued that while there isn't the wheel-based technique of racing, you've still got a lot to do with your characters, from firing off the weapons and attacking to using your special abilities. The thing is, rarely does pulling off some of the game's extra features translate into winning the game. While taking all available shortcuts is critical, doing tricks and power sliding correctly, hitting your foes and taking corners correctly rarely make the difference in the long run. Because of the arcade AI, and the competitive catch up that makes it so that your competition is always right at your toes, it always seems to be a race made in the last 10 seconds, no matter how well or poorly you've played. That's not to say that there isn't some strategy involved, because getting the meteor chunks will get you access to all the abilities, using weapons will give you the advantage during crucial moments, and so on.  It's just the curse of the arcade type game in general, and it's what keeps Mad Dash's extra features from holding more weight than they should.   Still, there's a lot of charm here, especially in the inventive use of the weapons, like a disco ball shield, or a light trail that, like the light bikes in Tron, gives you an energy trail that throws off your enemies. Having to punch in a button combo to get yourself out of an ice freeze is an awesome idea, and I think I speak for the entire world when I say that you can never have too many heat seeking chicken missiles. As for Multiplayer, it's a way to bring your friends into the levels of the game. The main gripe is that because of the huge levels you'll find yourself spread apart from other players, without any clue as to where they are in relation to you... but it's still fun, especially once you all get up to speed and learn your respective shortcuts. It's not as intimate as most racing games, but it's still a great time with your pals.  It's good clean fun, and works best when you're playing with a group of friends -- but in the end, you may wish that the multiple skills and the power slides, tricks, and other features of the game were made more use of in the final product. Is it wrong to wish that an arcade racer was a little less... arcadey? Then call me a sinner.  Graphics  Mad Dash manages to make a game that looks impressive and simple at the same time, the sort of looked pioneered by people like Naughty Dog back on the PlayStation. It's a cartoony world, but there are tons of details to keep you happy, especially considering how fast you fly by them most of the time. In Pipewerx you'll get a chance to see some nice reflective effects in the tubes, and fishies! Dino Oasis runs you by giant skeletal dinosaurs, through tubes, around tornadoes, and through cliffs. The ruins feature jungle leaves, an amazing water scramble through a set of three waterfalls, and jellyfish thingies that will make you want to kill all sea life. Bad jellyfish.  The game doesn't make use of the Xbox architecture in standard ways -- you're not going to see any insane specular mapping or bump mapping in this game to give textures added oomph, but what you will see are some incredible large, dense levels, filled with moving creatures, spinning parts, breakable edges and tons of animation. The levels are really alive, and give titles like Klonoa 2 a run for their money in terms of action on screen at once. Unfortunately, the price paid for all this is that framerates tend to chop down at times, and more regularly than you'd like -- it can get annoying, especially when you're trying to land your stylish moves. A locked 30 would have been nice, but when the game was originally supposed to be 60 frames per second and the final product can't even lock a good 30, it feels disappointing.  Sound You can't beat the lineup -- Moby , Fatboy Slim, MDFMK, the Propellerheads and other heavy hitters provide tracks to the game, giving perfect momentum to your adrenaline foot race. While the soundtrack's not huge, it's enough to keep you playing, and you can always turn off the songs you don't like in the menu system, or pick a specific song you want to listen to before you start a race. No soundtrack options, unfortunately, but the music's solid enough without becoming repetitive, so you'll never find yourself gritting teeth while listening. The voices, on the other hand...  There's something called being a little too witty, and it's called ~a show by the name of Dawson's Creek.~ In the gaming world, it's most easily identified as games like Fuzion Frenzy, and now Mad Dash, both games propagated by kooky characters. While it works, it'll also urk you at times, especially if you're just beginning to feel like you might just be a little above ~grabbing your joystick~ and fart humor. Or at least heavily handed versions of it, anyway. It won't kill you, but you'll start getting annoyed at cute catchphrases spouted as appoints knock you down again and again. Since there's a lot of falling in the game, be prepared for a lot of spouting to go with it. Sound effects are nice however, and everything fits together snugly, so even if you don't love the voices, they're still mixed in well with the overall package.  Mad Dash won't shock you or surprise you by being the arcade type game you expected it to be, despite talk of huge levels and multiple routes. If there's anything to get disappointed about, it's that once you've figured out your perfect routes, you'll have little interest in the actual act of running through the levels, unlike most racing titles, where it's usually the opposite experience. Unfortunately, what this creates is a racing game with the limited replayability of a platformer. You'll come back to this one, but mainly to play your friends.Mad Dash could use some more depth when it comes to the actual gameplay itself, but as arcade games go it delivers a fun, fast experience that's ultimately more fulfilling than other games of this type, like Cel Damage.", "date": "Nov 21, 2001"}
