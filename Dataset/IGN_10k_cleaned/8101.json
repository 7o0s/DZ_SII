We thought that Super Monkey Ball had taken the ball-rolling genre to its illogical extremes - but that was before we played Kororinpa, which manages to make the idea of monkeys trapped inside balls seem almost sensible.   Making the comparison between Kororinpa and Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz is certainly a logical place to start, mainly because on paper the two seem almost identical. Both feature a spherical object that must be rolled to the goal by tilting the level with the Wii Remote. However that's really where the similarities between the two end. Kororinpa rolls off in its own direction and ends up being a very different experience to Banana Blitz.    One of the major twists in the game is that the Wiimote gives total control over the playing field. Instead of just being able to tilt the level forwards, backwards, left or right, you're given 360 degrees of control over the stage. It can be held vertically to let a ball drop and even flipped upside down. By he later levels, the Wiimote is twisting and turning like a break-dancer. Yet, the basic concept remains throughout and, after a few levels to get to grips with the controls, it's possible to navigate through the most challenging remote-wrestling sections with relative ease.   This 360 degree control has enabled developer Hudson to craft some wonderfully ridiculous levels full of tunnels, narrow paths, moving platforms and winding roads. The aim of each level is to collect a certain amount of red crystals before venturing to the exit. On most stages, there's a obvious route to your goal, marked out by the crystals, and it's fairly difficult to get lost. Each new level provides a surprise or a different twist on the game's basic conceit and Hudson should be heralded as the king in this respect. Level design is definitely one of the highlights of the game and the epic scope of later stages easily eclipses Super Monkey Ball's offerings.    If all this level loveliness wasn't enough, then things are certainly helped along by Kororinpa's charm offensive. It's hard not to smile at almost every aspect of the game, including the differently-themed worlds you roll through. There are five in total, from a back garden to a bustling city. Depending upon the world, both the playing field and background change, so there's always something new to dazzle and delight - like the little Bomberman reference in the city levels.   Even the various balls at your dispoasl have their own unique personalities. Although only a marble is available at first it's soon possible to unlock more - like a planet, frog, UFO, cat or dog - each differing in weight, speed and responsiveness. Factor in the outrageously upbeat soundtrack and it's a recipe for happy happy joy joy. There's just something bizarrely appealing about watching a spherical cat meowing its way across a massive cake while bopping along to jolly jazz. Call us weird if you want.      Unfortunately, just as the game's visual charms and crafty level designs are pulling you in, it's all over. Kororinpa tragically feels like an unfinished game, never realising its full potential. There are only just over 40 levels, with a handful of secret ones to unlock. However, because many of the early stages feel like basic tutorials, teaching you how to effectively manipulate the environments, things only becoming challenging around level 20. It's possible to rocket through the main adventure in about three hours and then there's nothing much else to do beyond beating your best times or trying to unlock the remaining secret stages.   Adding to Kororinpa's rough-and-ready feel is the camera system. If you've played Super Monkey Ball - and for God's sake we'd hope you've at least played one by now - you know that ball rolling requires a precision camera system to help plot safe paths. Unfortunately, in Kororinpa, the camera is permanently fixed at the side of a stage, pointing inward. There's no way to spin the camera around or manually zoom out and in to give a different view. All too often, you'll find yourself blindly rolling the ball toward the camera, the angle making it impossible to see what's around the next bend. Which is far from ideal when you're hurtling straight toward a yawning chasm desperate to swallow your penguin.    For those with a multiplayer bent, Kororinpa also features a two-player split screen mode. Unfortunately, it's a fairly rudimentary race to see who can collect the required number of gems the quickest and make it to the goal. The only really interesting aspect is that you can play with either two Wiimotes or a Remote and Nunchuk attachment - thanks to the motion-sensing capabilities of both controllers. However, the two Wiimote route is definitely preferable - the bulbous shape of the nunchuck makes if difficult to judge when its back in its 'neutral' position, meaning you'll spend most of your time falling into space in frustrated anguish.Its hard not to warm to Kororinpa. The games cuter-than-cute visual style, jolly soundtrack and cunning level design are tough difficult to resist, assuming you're not a stone-hearted misery. However, simply too much of the game feels either half-finished or rough around the edges. There aren't enough levels, challenge is practically non-existant and the ill-conceived camera is an endless source of annoyance. It is possible to have fun with Kororinpa but thats more to do with its boundless charm than gameplay polish.", "date": "Feb 22, 2007"}
