The spineless war game, starring dueling teams of earthworms, charms with its silly sound effects and asinine arsenal, but endures because the gameplay is pure genius. Can a handset edition manage to capture and replicate the magic?   Features:   Based on PC/console series  Turn-based strategy  Multiple maps  Multiple weapons   Unfortunately, the answer to that last question is no. As we suspected, this go-go version of Worms falls far short of its namesake -- but, honestly, it seems the blame doesn't fall on the development team, Kiloo. Rather, handsets seem ill-equipped to host a game like Worms, or at least a version of Worms that fans would be happy playing.   Right from the get-go, two things torpedo Worms. One, movement is extremely limited. Jumping is not an option, and the movement-based gear like ninja ropes and jetpacks are nowhere to be found. Two, the amount of weapons available hasn't just been halved, it's been practically reduced to an eighth. Bazooka, grenades, cluster bombs, dynamite -- great weapons to use, but where are the shotguns, Uzis, banana bombs, and sheep? Where is my holy hand grenade?   Because the handset screen is so small, level maps have extremely reduced real estate. Most levels are simply a flat surface, like an island, with some sort of obstacle between the two warring teams, such as a tree or snowman. This reduces the game to something of a deadly volleyball game, launching weapons across the divide. Tit for tat goes until somebody loses -- usually it's whoever went second, or has really bad aim.   There are other factors that affect the level, such as wind strength. If the wind is blowing in your favor, you can launch a grenade with less strength and get the same amount of distance. Alternatively, if the wind is blowing in your direction, you can launch a bazooka over your enemy's head, then have the win blow it back down on them. And levels are ultimately destructible, with dynamite and grenades blowing open the landscape. Too bad, though, that the shockwaves and recoil from weapons are also missing. In the PC version, if was often better to blast somebody off a perch to their doom rather than go for a direct hit.   Worms supports two play modes -- either you play against another person and hand the phone back and forth, or you play against the computer. This is another area where Worms falls down. The computer is either a crack shot or is incredibly stupid. For example, on a winter level, the computer had been slowly destroying the snowman between us. Finally, there was just a sliver of snowman remaining (but nothing either of us could jump over!). The computer uses it's turn to destroy the rest of the snowman, allowing me to waltz over and finish the match with a well-placed stick of dynamite. Zzzz.Worms on the cellphone is a pale, pale shadow of the franchise that spawned it. The control, weapon selection, and level designs are far too simplistic to really approximate a good Worms experience. But that's coming from a hardcore fan. Perhaps player that have zero exposure to Worms and have no idea what the real deal plays like will enjoy this earthworm-starring take on Artillery Duel.
