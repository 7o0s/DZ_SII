While the game developers recently announced that they have hired the legendary Peter Gabriel to compose music for the Myst series of games, that's just the tip of their sonic iceberg. The company has scored a major coup with the soundtrack for their newest game XIII by enlisting the top notch turntable and post-millennial funk ambiance of Future Primitive Sound to create a totally immersive journey into the realms of deep seated, quasi-mystical groove.   Perhaps the coolest thing about The Thirteen Soundtrack is that it works outside of the game as an entertaining slab of mid-tempo futuro funk with tinges of '70s throwback and a decidedly hip-hop oriented undercurrent. That it's put together like a seamless mixtape is all the more impressive, giving the CD the feeling of a continuous score that shifts tempo and mood with sophisticated ease.    The soundtrack has been composed by several different musicians, all of whom are affiliated with San Francisco's renowned Future Primitive Sound art collective. Since it's put together like a continuous mix, there are no song titles, just 13 unidentified tracks that flow one into the other. To further add to the mystery, the CD booklet aligns each musician with a character from the game. DJs Faust and Shortee are linked to the title character XIII. DJ Zeph is connected to Carrington. J-Boogie's Dubtronic Science is tied to Mongoose. Romanowski is teamed up with Jones. Meat Beat Manifest's Jack Dangers is paired with Sheridan. And Bing Ji Ling is affiliated with Amos. But mysterious connections aside, the soundtrack is all about the music.   The album commences with some eerie, all most menacing piano tones (think Hitchcock) which are augmented by dialogue from the game in which an assassination attempt has been taken against the president. From this freaky intro the album slides into a shuffling funk jazz romp that is interspersed with further dialogue, punchy horns, and swift blitzes of scratchmatic wonderment. Finger poppin' and neck snappin' goodness, to be sure that rolls along to a seriously fat bassline.   Track #3 keeps the mood stuck in the groove, adding a zippy blitz of cowbells and some  tasty snare backbeats that bump underneath a stripped down rhythm guitar track. Slight James Brown ~Uhs!~ are tucked into the mix that eventually builds out to include soulful horns on a serious romp. This bleeds into Track #4, which goes from bumping drums that keep the break beat on full tilt while some back masked scratching and squirrelly horns fill the void before bluesy guitar scourge filters itself into the mix. Track #5 picks up the tempo, adding faux flute licks to give the musical vibe a somewhat island flavored repose. A tribalistic drum tilt only adds to the effect, which then turns somewhat ominous thanks to pulsing shifts of synth. It's like classic chase scene music mixed with spy/surveillance styled rhythms. Haunting voices eventually slip into the mix along with what can only be described as the sound of rolling bones.    Track #6 begins with the same ominous vibe as the previous track, but then dips into Stevie Wonder clavinet inspired boom offset by shuffling beats and pulsating faux horn blasts. At a mere 1:39 it's the shortest track on the album other than the 39 second intro. But thanks to the stellar mixing it slips right into Track #7, which pumps up the volume with the flute loops and undulating rhythm surges. The drums take center stage as all manner of soundsfrom video game blips, whirrs, and sundry noisewaft in and out of the sound collage.    Track #8 retreats to a loping bassline for its centerpiece over which nice scratches are dropped in. The bass bleeds out from time to time to allow nothing more than a muted drum break to pulse along, thus giving the whole affair a stripped down, minimalistic rhythm feel. Track #9 jumps back into hell blazing territory, as amped up drums propel this portion of the soundtrack into interstellar overdrive. What's super cool is that the rhythm tracking is in a constant state of flux, shifting time signatures and flipping the beat incessantly.    Track #10 returns to somewhat eerie terrain, coalescing churgling synth and Lost In Space haunting ambient noise over a standard break beat blast. The disembodied voices that flit in and out of the mix only add to the mysterious jazz tint. The track eventually disintegrates into bongos and scratching before the rhythm takes a shot in the ass and jacks itself up to a hyper kinetic level turning into Track #11, which is nothing short of a full on bongo blow out with snare speed, and wurgling synth cascading all over the place.    Track #12 slows things down a tad, with mellow bongo bump, nice organ fills, and intergalactic synth that wavers from channel to channel, giving off the effect of electronic water washing over the aural proceedings. Treated guitar wah-wahs into the sound spectrum, echoing with flanged reverberation while moans of passion are interjected at strategic moments. It's like a slice of blaxploitation soniference snatched from the '70s and remade for beyond 2003 player status.    The album concludes with Track #13, which is all rife with chiming bells and ping-ponged rhythm interplay. Spoken word snippets from the game come in and out of the mix, which is gradually injected with healthy shots of scratchmatic wonderment and an ever building bounce of drums and synthetic surge. It builds to a crescendo then starts to fade into stripped down rhythms and chicka-chicka guitar, then weird shuffling that bounces from channel to channel before a disembodied voice yells ~You can't run forever Number Thirteen!~   And then it's all over. The Thirteen Soundtrack is one of those albums you can put on and literally forget about as the music slowly engulfs you and your surroundings. It's an album that works expertly as a chill-out slice of background groove, yet it also doubles as a dance floor jolt of exuberance perfect for spinning at a small party. Call it jazzaphonic electronic tripped out funkuphoria, if you will.", "date": "Oct 20, 2003"}
