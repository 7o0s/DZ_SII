The character's transition from the last console generation to this one didn't go over so well when Vivendi Universal brought out Spyro the Dragon: Enter the Dragonfly last year, but his handheld adventures have always been solid and satisfying. This year's game, while still based around the previous two designs, changes things up a bit to put more focus on ~adventuring~ more than ~action.~ The end result is a familiar experience, but with plenty more variety in gameplay that extends this experience into an adventure that lasts a good long time. Features Massive new Spyro world New Agent 9 and Sgt Byrd. sublevels Cartridge save (three slots) Link cable support for two players Attack of the Rhynocs is what we in the industry like to call a ~collect-a-thon.~ The game design requires players, as the cute little purple dragon Spyro, to wander the different lands, not only collecting gems hidden in smashable jars and dropped by enemies, but also trying to acquire specific items hidden in each area. See, in the story, Spyro must travel to each different location in order to score the ~heart~ of that land. But the lead character in each land won't give it up without something in return, so players will have to play delivery boy by collecting the items that particular character needs in order to get the ultimate prize of each area.  Each of the different levels in Attack of the Rhynocs has its own set of challenges, and the prizes available are documented in the game's journal. Some items are a simple matter as platform-hopping and flying to a remote location on the map, and picking up the icon. Others are a little more difficult to acquire, locked away in colored chests that can only be opened by acquiring the key...another ~collection~ element since each key is broken into two pieces. Others still can be purchased from the Spyro-universe tightwad, Moneybags, using the collected gems to buy the item he has in his custody.  The gameplay and control of Attack of the Rhynocs is entirely based around what Digital Eclipse created for Season of Flame and Season of Ice. Just like last year's sequel, Digital Eclipse tightened up the control once again, and even bumped up the game's engine that allow for more graphical flash as well as new enhancements in level design and challenges. The biggest alteration is, of course, the unlimited lives element. If Spyro falls or takes one too many hits from enemy attacks, the game sends him back to the last place on the map that Spyro exited, with absolutely no penalty. It sounds like this element makes the game far easier than its predecessors, but considering the immense size of the game's world and the variety of challenges in each level, it's a great choice to go this way since ~death~ is no longer a massive and annoying set-back.  With no penalties attributed in death, Attack of the Rhynocs encourages players to take more chances. There will be plenty of opportunity to put the dragon's gliding abilities to use, and in this perspective it's not the easiest thing to find a safe landing spot. Fall into the deadly void? No worries, just give it another shot.  There are still areas where the controls and collision detection could use some additional tweaks, especially during any sort of challenge that requires Spyro to shove objects around in the angled perspective...this is where much of the game's frustration comes from, and there are several puzzles in the game that require precise control that the game engine just can't offer. And much of this loose control can be attributed to the fact that Spyro has to spin in place in order to face the other direction...perhaps the designers could have offered an easier way to get the dragon to turn without moving?  Even though the game's focus is more about adventuring in Attack of the Rhynocs, the designers worked in a lot of action for Spyro. Some levels feature Zaxxon-style shooting challenges, while others put the dragon in a footrace against three other characters. The designers definitely put the game engine to use, showing just how versatile it's come along since the last game's release last year.  Like the previous games in the series, Attack of the Rhynocs' design doesn't revolve solely around the dragon and his isometric viewpoint. There are two distinctly different game styles of several levels each that players must complete in order to score the aforementioned key pieces, and these separate challenges add to the variety already put in the main game's design. The better of these two challenges is Sgt. Byrd's Rescue, a cool combination of Choplifter, Joust, and Gravitar. Players flap around the side-scrolling level, rescuing lost party members and carrying them off to their safety tent. This challenge is actually decent enough that it's also outside of the adventure as Attack of the Rhynocs' link cable multiplayer mode in both cooperative and competitive modes.  The second, and weaker, challenge puts players once again in control of Agent 9 in a side-scrolling ~stealth~ game that melds Metal Gear Solid with Luigi's Mansion, sucking up enemies before they can yell out for help if they catch eyes with the monkey. These levels are much larger in size and challenge than the Sgt. Byrd's Rescue areas...and they go on longer than they really need to. The game's saving system doesn't record these missions in progress, either, which makes them a tough bunch of levels to play while on the go. The change from action to adventure gives players a lot more to do in this latest Spyro adventure. The collecting aspect is very blatant, though, and goes a little too far in artificially extending the game's length...in some cases it's a drag to continuously revisit the same level over and over to acquire a previously inaccessible item. And even with the new focus in adventuring, the game doesn't feel entirely new or unique since much has been recycled from past Spyro games. Still, even with all that said Spyro's third adventure is a fun and familiar treat on the Game Boy Advance that will last  a decent amount of play time...even for experienced gamers.", "date": "Nov 11, 2003"}
