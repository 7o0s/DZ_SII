Fearsome fiends from an ancient age, they walked the earth as tyrant kings. They lorded over all, their mastery of the planet unchallenged by any other beings  until a lowly plumber came and tamed them all for sport. Reduced to simple, saddled beasts of burden, the once mighty creatures nonetheless cooperated with their new, red-capped master, bearing him forth to victory in Super Mario World.   Shigeru Miyamoto wanted Mario to ride. But not a vehicle  that would come later. And not a horse, because that would go to Link. Miyamoto's mind was more imaginative for his mustached man. He conceived of, early on in the 8-bit days, the idea of mascot Mario riding astride a great green dinosaur. But the NES couldn't handle it. Nintendo's first console didn't have the power. So while Yoshi was born in the '80s, he lived for years only in the pages of Shiggy's many sketchbooks.   It wasn't until 1991 and the release of the 16-bit SNES that Miyamoto's vision of prehistoric equestrianism could be realized  Super Mario World was a launch title for Nintendo's second home console, and it featured the new signature gameplay mechanic of rideable dino pals. Mario encounters Yoshi early on in this adventure, the fourth major platforming game in the Super Mario series. He and his brethren have been trapped in eggs by Bowser's evil magic, and Mario's tasked with saving both them and the ever-kidnapped Princess from the clan of Koopa crooks.          Riding Yoshi gave the standard run-and-jump Mario series' playstyle a new twist  stomping on enemies to defeat them was now supported by a secondary offensive option, ingestion. Yoshi's long red tongue can be sent sailing out forward to grab and snatch hopeless Goombas, Koopas and Monty Moles, then doomed to a fate of slow and agonizing digestion in the pit of the creature's endless stomach. Yoshi is insatiable, and there are only very few of Bowser's many minions that the dino can't devour.   On foot and alone, Mario's own abilities became somewhat more focused in World. Super Mario Bros. 3 had equipped the hero with a long list of power-up abilities, including the rarely-seen Tanooki and Hammer Bros. suits. Here, though, the items are once again made few  the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and flight-enabling Cape Feather were the core trio of treasures. A new innovation was the item storage box, hovering in the top-center of the screen, where an extra power-up would rest in reserve until called upon with the Select Button, or until Mario took damage below.   Super Mario World contained those and several other fresh ideas for the franchise, making itself a winner among the Nintendo faithful and a game that ultimately sold in the millions. And today, the game's still a great play  the winding paths and hidden exits of Dinosaur Land are fun to revisit, the core of the experience still pure Nintendo joy. But truthfully, Super Mario World is a bit lacking. Miyamoto himself holds that opinion, feeling even today that he could have done more with the game to separate and distinguish it from being a graphically-upgraded continuation of Bros. 3.    History supports his instincts of the time, as Sega capitalized on the lack of true evolution in Mario's gameplay to push forward their own mascot and message. The Genesis took hold of the marketplace in the 16-bit era, using Sonic the Hedgehog's blazing-fast speed as a potently palatable alternative to the still-slow pace of Nintendo's plodding plumber. It was a war, friends. Both games, Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Mario World, were excellent in their own rights. Super Mario World was the deeper of the two, much more fully featured and possessed of some of Nintendo's best ever level design. But it didn't have Sonic's wow factor. Sonic was the speedy, fresh newcomer, and, as our own Peer Schneider has said, Mario was the old man.   This particular tangent of discourse is brought to you by the concept of irony. For all their fighting, for all their comparisons, the two major players in the game industry's most memorable console war are now available, for the first time ever, on the same piece of hardware. It's February 5, 2007, and true peace has been declared in the conflict that erupted over 15 years ago. Even now, Sonic the Hedgehog may be sitting in your Wii's array of channels, right next to its longtime rival. There's a moment of poetry in that.   And there's a moment of poetry in that Super Mario World finally gave Shigeru Miyamoto the opportunity to realize his vision of dinosaur-riding, long held in his mind as a wish to see brought to life. How many other ~new~ ideas do we see in today's Nintendo releases that first found their origins ages ago, in the penciled pages of a younger Miyamoto's paper pads? Mario was destined to subjugate the terrors of the Jurassic for years before he got the chance to do it  how long, then, has he been fated to fly through space?  Super Mario World could be argued to take the crown for greatest 2D Mario platformer, and as such earns almost immediate recommendation for download to your Wii. The recommendation is tentatively withheld, however, pending examination of your history of ownership with the game  its ported Game Boy Advance iteration, Super Mario Advance 2: Super Mario World, has become one of the best-selling games of all time on Nintendo's handheld systems since its release five years ago. The portable package is perfectly playable, meaning you should save your Points if you're one of the millions of gamers to own it there, in cartridge form. Otherwise, download away. Especially you, stalwart Sonic supporters  the white flag is waving, the war now at an end. Come experience Mario's adventures, and the debut of his dinosaur friend.", "date": "Feb 6, 2007"}
