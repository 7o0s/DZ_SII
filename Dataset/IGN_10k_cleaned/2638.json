Crash was Sony's answer to Mario.  A few years and a few games have passed and Crash has been cut free from its Sony ties.  Now able to pop up on any console, Vivendi Universal has ported Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex to Xbox.  It's been half a year since The Wrath of Cortex was released on PS2.  Those six months bought a graphical upgrade but little else for everyone's favorite orange bugger.  With nothing truly new to offer, Crash must stand on its own merits.   Features Everyone's favorite bandicoot! New 'fur shading' not seen on PS2 version.  Crash looks more real than ever 30 levels of platform action Drive a jeep, fly a plane, and die many times Improved framerate and textures over PS2 version Greatly improved load times over PS2 version 4-channel surround Supports HDTV 480i and 480p Gameplay Crash utilizes the new staple of platformers, the hub.  Like Maximo, the hub is where you save your game and access various levels.  It offers an easy barometer of your progress.  Each of the five areas has six levels, including a boss level.  You need to pass the five initial levels in an area to open the boss battle.  After beating a boss, the next area will open.  The first four bosses are based on the elements.  Crash can jump, do spin attacks, slide, and belly flop at the start of the game.  New moves are earned as you progress through the game.  Crash is easy to control and his moves are as simple as the press of a button.  Enemies require different moves to take down and some must simply be avoided altogether.  Levels are a mix of vehicle combat and standard platformer stunts.  You'll jump around, smashing boxes to earn peaches (which lead to extra lives), crash through enemies, and misjudge platform distances and fall and die.  The vehicle levels are a breath of fresh air from the standard platform elements, but they are either too easy or too frustrating to enjoy.  There's no balanced median.  For example, it's a lot of fun to fly around in a plane blasting balloons while enemy fighters zip past you.  However, if you ignore the fighters and just go after the tornado machines (you need to take out six of them), you'll pass the level quickly and with little interference from enemies.  There are a lot of elements in Crash that could have been cool but end up falling a little short.  Crash isn't alone in fighting the forces of evil.  He's assisted by Coco, a less powerful and less enjoyable playable character.  Coco pops into specific levels and must be used to pass that area.  She's just not fun the way crash is.  Crash is a silly creature to look at.  He's almost absurd, which works great with his various animations.  Coco isn't really silly at all.  The game isn't called Crash and Coco so why must I be forced to play her? Rather than add variety, Coco detracts from the only real selling point of the game -- Crash Bandicoot.  While the game is very fun in some areas, it has some shortcomings.  Primarily, the perspective isn't right in some areas and you just can't judge where objects (or lasers) are in relation to Crash.  Jumping can also get tricky with no real ability to properly judge the distance to the next platform.  You'll certainly find yourself jumping too far or too short from time to time.  Another problem with the game is with the out-of-control vibration.  Just because you can use vibration, doesn't mean you have to go full bore.  When you are in Crash's gerbil ball, the controller shakes so violently that it almost comes out of your hand.  And it's constant.  This happens in various areas so much that I had to turn off the vibration function.  If there's no dynamic range to the strength of vibration, then the sensation is pointless.  The last thing is level balance.  The regular levels are almost always too easy, but the boss battles are sometimes ridiculously tough.  With six months to tweak Crash, there's no excuse for such unbalanced gameplay.  Look at me, I'm Crash Bandicoot!  Graphics The graphics received the most attention in bringing Crash to Xbox.  The franchise has never looked so good.  The slowdown and stuttered animations that marred the PS2 version are all but gone.  Added is the new 'fur shading' which gives Crash some actual fur on his body.  The environments are well done, much better than I would ever have suspected.  Crash on PS2 never looked like a next-gen game, but here on Xbox it does.  This is some of the best use of color on Xbox.  The rich palette of colors brings the strange world of Crash to vivid life.  Crash offers plenty of humorous animations to enjoy, though the enemies are pretty bland and boring for the most part.  Ewww... wet fur smell!  Sound The sound effects and music in crash are good on their own, with plenty of zany little tunes that fit the mood perfectly.  However, when thrown in to surround sound, the mix is not good.  The center channel isn't used, so voices, and everything in front of Crash is split between the two front channels.  The music is also pumped through the front channels, leaving the rear speakers to handle peripheral sound effects from enemies Crash has passed.  Because almost all of the sounds are placed on the front speakers and the score is pumped so loudly, the sound effects, which are nice, are almost impossible to hear.  A sloppy job of implementing good sound.Crash is a fun game for the most part, and not a terrible pick up.  However, it fails in some areas, like proper game balance and correct use of surround sound.  Those who love the series will probably be more thrilled than others who haven't followed previous adventures of Crash.  While the game is attractive, there could have been more done to the game to fix the balancing problems.  The game is only a few hours long and only completists will go back to find everything in the game.  A good rental, but not likely to be a good purchase.", "date": "Apr 26, 2002"}
