Gone are the  value-priced products designed specifically for the European market.  Now  its lineup's devoted entirely to rally sims, off-road racers, and high  profile sports related properties.  And in a show of its newfound might, the  company's partnered with ex-Nintendo conspirator Mike Tyson as a quick way  to gain instant credibility in the boxing ring.  Unfortunately, this time King Hippo, Bald Bull, Glass Joe and the rest of the old gang won't be joining us.   Gameplay Arcade junkies will be disappointed.  Upon ripping off the plastic,  they'll be ogling a semi-realistic simulation instead of a shameless Punch  Out clone.  Not that this has been hyped as a Punch Out clone, mind you. But while observing the proceedings from a behind the back view, the feeling of being there has all but dried up.   Players control one of 16 world champions in their quest to become 'the man', aka the undisputed world heavyweight champion.  An arsenal of blows,  ranging from body shots to uppercuts, special blows and hooks, enable up-and- coming bruisers to put their money where their mouth is.   It's obvious that something's not right from the start. After sifting  through a mound of loading screens, weak intro sequences roll across the screen.  What you'd  hope for are slammin' tunes, blinding lights and boxers charging out of the  arena doors sweating and snarling like enraged bulls.  What you get in  actuality are zombies shuffling toward the ring while crowds cheer  unconvincingly and a sprinkle of colored rectangles doubles as a strobe  effect. Yawn.   Bouts continue this proud tradition and have a very flaccid feel.   Combatants steadily circle one another than lurch in to deliver a blow or  three in rapid succession.  Hold down a button to build up power and a  fighter just lifts his arm back like a gimp until the punch is executed.   Generally, there's little going down that's worth watching.  Although  suspense and anticipation accompany real world fights, none of this  excitement is accurately conveyed here.  Mostly you'll just dance  around an opponent, feel out their style, then dive in for the kill.  That's  true to form, perhaps, but fun, good gracious no.   Mercifully, if naught else can be said for the product, the concept is easy  to comprehend.  A blue and red meter at the top of the screen corresponds to  knockdowns.  Land blows and it shifts in your direction or take one too many  and watch it sway toward the opposite corner.  Once the bar touches either  the left or right corner, a boxer's headed for the canvas.  Smaller power  meters also represent how close fighters stand to being permanently knocked  out.  Meanwhile, all one has to do is keep an eye on these indicators and  turn up the heat.   However the title's played, entertainment is not much of an option.   The Practice mode is weak; you'll gain zero insight into the sport's intricacies  from pounding on an android-esque sparring partner.  The Showcase mode, or what's  commonly known as a knockout tournament, can be more fulfilling, as  contestants from around the world compete for respect.  A versus mode adds  very little to the experience, except for up to five additional warm bodies  who'll share in the misery.   World play, or career mode, is the headliner.  Under this setup, you start  out with a glass jawed rookie and attempt to run him up the international  circuit.  This involves booking fights, setting a training regiment, and  taking intermittent advice from a smiling rendition of Mike Tyson's crusty  mug.  While the strategic planning bits might've amounted to something  tangible, though, they're too oversimplified to serve a meaningful purpose.   Thus the on-screen entertainment consists of forcing weeks to go by,  observing other brawlers in action, and once in a while setting up and  conducting a match of your own.  Zzzzzzzzz...   Graphics Since little to no backgrounds exist and the ring's a basic construct, the  boxers have been well rendered.  Furthermore, great texture work gives them  a realistic, sweat-drenched appearance that's light years ahead of the rest  of the presentation.  But backdrops don't mean squat; whether you're in  Palermo, Sicily or Las Vegas, the environment is all but irrelevant.  The  Animation is also unreliable, as while pugilists move with surprising grace,  they fall like crippled yaks, staggering like drunk robots and coming to  rest in odd, stiff positions.  Overall, this titles visuals are a roller  coaster ride of ups and downs.   Sound Lots of crowd cheers.  And grunts, groans, moans, and thwacks when fists  connect with flesh.  The menu music's a strangely out of place club mix  that's more suited to a rave than a serious sporting event.  Other tunes  sound like weak heavy metal tracks a la Slayer on the day following a Jack  Daniels binge.  The announcer, whom much of the audio portion's impact  revolves around, speaks through a filter and has the charisma of a slab of  Swiss cheese.  This will not, I repeat not, get you in the mood for an ass  whuppin'.Granted, The Great White Hype was just a movie.  But who could forget the intros by Method Man, the flash and dazzle, the ring girls, and the fan frenzy which ensued?  Reality's much less flashy, as depicted by Mike Tyson's Boxing. Yet in the name of all that's holy, titles need SOME personality.  Look at Ready 2 Rumble, which takes a big fat tinkle on this disc, which is arguably the most comatose fighter ever invented.
