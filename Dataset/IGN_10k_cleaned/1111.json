It starts out slow and quickly becomes confusing to the point of senselessness. Soulbringer takes the brilliant concept of starting you out knowing nothing about the game itself and teaching you about the world and the story as you go. Unfortunately it doesn't make things clear soon enough for you to appreciate the good points of the game. The story isn't that great, the graphics aren't anything special, and the strengths of the rest of the game seem to fall by the wayside as a result. But having said that, a small amount of fun is there for anyone with the patience to see it through.  You can see therefore how playing the game is a combination of both frustrating and engaging design decisions. The things that are good are quite goodthe combat system and the feeling of character growth--are big plusses in my book. The story line and overall interface leave much to be desired. In part this is one of the sad things about Soulbringer; it's got so much promise that's wasted on account of the lack of direction in the game.  The first thing you notice is that the game doesn't look so hot. But, like the game as a whole, the visual side of Soulbringer has that irritating ~kind of good, kind of bad~ appearance that constantly keeps you wondering whether you should be impressed with the game or digging through the trash for the receipt. The game begins with a graphics test so you can set up your system to run the game as beautifully and smoothly as possible. The trouble is, there doesn't seem to be a button that says, ~be more pretty.~ The textures are far too square and blocky to be convincing at all unless they're viewed at a distance. But the character models are nice (if a little disjointed) and the animations are really top notch. The incredible snow effects would go a long way to making the game better if you didn't spend so much time indoors.  The architectural side of the game is commendable. The levels and towns are all very natural looking (at least in terms of layout) and the overall shape of the world is pretty convincing. Things are a tad on the restricted side though with the individual zones being pretty tiny. Your field of view is also regrettably small. The draw depth is shorter than the career of an arthritic gladiator. You can rarely see as far as you character ought and this causes you to become lost if you're not entirely sure where you're going. This makes the absence of an auto-mapping feature just plain rude. The black ring surrounding your character also makes it seem like you're adventuring in the land of eternal night. Coincidentally, all the shops in the town are closed at the beginning of the game because it's supposed to be nighttime. The shops open the next morning and never, ever close again. Suddenly we're supposed to believe that it's daytime all the time now? Even though we still can't see anything more than a few feet away?  But while you're worrying about that, you'll have the chance to notice some of the really positive things about Soulbringer. The combat system is intriguing and somewhat original. You take a much more active role in the real time combats here than you do in most games. The various weapons each have strengths and weaknesses (clubs and maces are good against skeletons, swords are better against opponents in leather armor, etc). Each weapon also has a unique set of moves. You begin the game with only the most basic combat abilitiesin this case this means just swinging your knife. As you allocate more experience to your combat skill, you'll get more sophisticated moves, each of which is selectable in combat by pressing a hotkey. Each move does a different amount of damage, takes a particular amount of time to execute, and attacks your opponent in a certain area. Figuring out that I had to use low attacks against spiders or opponents standing downhill from me was really cool. You can set up combat combos to save your finger some exercise, but I preferred to make up my combos on the fly rather than rely on a few specific formulae.  I guess it's far too late for gamers to begin complaining about how unrealistic it is to stop in the middle of a fight and eat an apple to recover some health. Still, in Soulbringer this device seemed much more artificial than in most other games. Running away from an army of gargoyles and zombies while I shoved ham down my throat to heal myself just seemed dumb to me. But since it is a standard of RPGs, I won't say anything about it...oops, too late.  I had hopes that the magic system would be equally inventive as the combat system. Shows how much I know. While the magic system as outlined in the manual sounded cool, in practice it was anything but. I found that I suddenly had acquired the ability to cast magic spells without any real understanding of how it had happened. I know it had something to do with a book I possessed and a special rune that I found that went with the book. It seemed simple enough and I was eager to reproduce the effect by purchasing other magic books for which I had already obtained the requisite runes. For some reason it just didn't work and I found myself a thousand gold pieces poorer as a result.  This just makes the magic system more confusing than it should be.  I usually complain of these games that the path of the story is too apparent and too rigid. Soulbringer takes it too far to the other extreme though. Half the time I was playing I wasn't even sure what I was supposed to be doing. It seemed far too often that I literally stumbled upon the main plot points of the story. Game designers have long since realized the importance of providing an in-game journal to help you keep track of your quests, but the journal in Soulbringer just doesn't provide enough information.  In just one example you'll be asked to destroy the corpse of a woman in order to...well, to be honest, I'm not really sure why you're supposed to destroy her body, but it seemed important at the time. Anyway, you're told at the beginning of the quest where to search for the body but your journal only records that you're supposed to destroy it. It doesn't mention anything about where to find it. This would be all right in a much more linear adventure, but when you've got six different quests you're working on simultaneously it's easy to loose track of the specifics.  It's even worse to stumble upon the solution to a quest totally by accident. Early on you'll have to free farmers from a mine. There's really no clue as to how to do this. All you know is that there are several mine carts resting on various tracks throughout the mine. There's also a giant stone altar somewhere in the mine that plays into the solution, but it seems to me that I only figured out the trick to it by accident. What's even more strange is that the events you have to set in motion to release the farmers are so time delayed that when you do set those events in motion, you're sure to be miles away when the payoff comes. Right in the middle of your exploration of the mines, the game is interrupted by a cutscene informing you that you somehow managed to blunder into success.  Hey look, I'm Jar-Jar Binks!  There are lots of other things I could complain about, but why bother?  By time it was over, I used a very advanced mathematical equation to determine that for every hour I played, I had had about twenty minutes of fun. There are some good points to this game but they're almost totally obscured or canceled out by the things that the game gets wrong. Like I said, you have to work at this one to make it worthwhile and if I hadn't had to write this review, I'd have given up long before I finally did.  -- Stephen Butts    Comment on this story", "date": "Jul 18, 2000"}
