Golf games are supposed to be for PC users who hate sports-crazy kids like me. Golf games are supposed to separate the hardcore, in-your-grill, slamma-touchdown-goooaaal! sports fanatic from your everyday goody-goody businessman executive who can't go anywhere for their lunch break. Now I know these statements spell ~gross generalization,~ but I'm trying to paint a picture here. VR Golf '97 is a golf game that everyone can love. What really impressed me the most was the amount of ~Play Styles~ to choose from. There is a practice mode which allows you to focus on your strokes and practice your overall game. The ~swing-o- meter~ is precise and really easy to use. But don't let all that practice go to waste. You and three other friends can participate in an AMA Tour, the objective of which is to achieve a zero handicap. From there, you can participate in the PRO Tour, where you can play against 48 different golfers in four rounds of 18 holes each. Believe it or not, the action doesn't stop there. VR Golf '97 has all the usuals: fade and draw, club selection, a ~mulligan~ and ~gimme~ option, and replay camera. It even has an announcer that gives credit when it's due and criticism when you're having an off day. Not only does the game play well, but it looks simply awesome. With eleven player views and 9 different ball cameras you can't miss a thing. With great graphics and great gameplay this one definitely shoots under par.  Lets face it, golf games have never been a success for console systems. They have simply been an incentive for PC owners. VR Golf '97 on the other hand beats the odds and successfully combines PC features and console gameplay.   PSX Staff", "date": "Jan 21, 1997"}
