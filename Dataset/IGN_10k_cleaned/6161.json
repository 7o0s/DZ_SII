It's a care-free action game starring a bunch of stick figures kicking the stuffing out of each other. Oh, and there is a bear in there, too. Dude, who doesn't love bears?   Stick Fighter Fury casts you as a lone, skinny warrior up against the Shadow Clan, a nefarious gang of stick figure nasties that have stolen your girlfriend. There's only one way to get her back, too. That's right -- you answer violence with violence, unleashing a series of goofball punches and kicks that are more charming than chilling. When coupled with some great slapfight effects, Stick Fighter Fury brand of beatdown is downright infectious.   In many ways, players will be reminded of the classic Prince of Persia games -- which is a favorable comparison. Rather than run from left to right, you must navigate a series of rooms that present individual tricks, traps, and stick figure ninjas to contend with before an exit presents itself. Usually, when you enter a room, the ninjas are not expecting you -- even though you just kicked the crap out of their compatriots one room over. As soon as your presence is detected, the enemies descend on you, leaving you with no choice but bust out a series of moves and defend yourself. As you encounter tougher bad guys, you'll see them change color. The color-coding system is actually helpful for determining the priority of targets. Red guys are stronger than blue guys, for example.   When you begin Stick Fighter Fury, you only have a few basic attacks under your tight belt. However, as you play, you earn new moves like a back kick which come in handy against the game's later enemies. You can also grab sticks (heh) to use against the enemy ninjas. As you slam evil, your energy meter slowly fills up. When it tops out, you can unleash special moves, such as fireballs and dragon punches. All of these attacks are easy to perform, thanks to the game's smart controls.   Stick Fighter Fury is not to be taken seriously, a point underlined by the game's production values. The enemy sprites are under-detailed and the backdrops are lacking in colorful textures. The game looks under-cooked, but that's entirely on purpose. And it helps keep the game moving quite smoothly -- which is important for action games.  Stick Fighter Fury is just fun to play. You sit down, bust through a few rooms, and then set the phone aside while you get on with your daily tasks. When you have a spare moment, you pick it back up, smack around some stick figures and the smile returns to your face. It's not a terribly deep game, but with so many rooms, it will last for some time if played in bite-sized sessions. Guppy Games made a smart pick-up with Stick Fighter Fury, and I hope it sees many, many downloads.", "date": "Oct 14, 2005"}
