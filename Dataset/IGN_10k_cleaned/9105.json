Amongst the more hardcore gamers, however, there's been only one soccer game worth playing since the turn of the century, and that's been Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer series. For FIFA 08 then, there are (once again) two important questions to be answered - is this year's FIFA better than its predecessor and does it do a better job recreating the beautiful game than Pro Evo?   That last question won't be answered until Pro Evo 2008 hits stores, but we can tell you right now that FIFA 08 is a definite improvement over last year's game. The most dramatic and noticeable changes in FIFA 08 are in the physics of the game, which combine with nicely tweaked controls. Chipping/lobbing was an element that felt - at times - like it came down to pure luck in FIFA 07, whereas it's far more fluid and controlled this time around. Tackling too has also been beefed up, a nice addition being when two players go for the ball, it will now spin away from you both, rather than sticking to your feet like glue. You'll then have to jostle and battle to gain a clear advantage in getting the ball back. There are other new additions, from step-overs to ball rolls and body feints which are all far easier to execute this time around. These new moves are more reflective of a genuine soccer match and a nice enhancement in this instalment.     Importantly, you now have far more control when it comes to shooting; using the analogue stick means that you can now pinpoint exactly where in the goal you want to place the ball. In the past, the shooting system simply wasn't as accurate as it is here, and as a result FIFA 08 instantly has more variation and longevity in terms of attacking the goal. That said, free kicks and corners have taken on a far more arcadey approach this time around - just point and power up, with elements like ball spin, making players run into certain positions or even adopting certain set pieces, seeming to have fallen largely by the wayside.   Another thing we should mention is the fact that you can now have control over goalkeepers for the first time. Previously it was a case of holding a button to call the keeper out and hoping they'll pull off a save. Full control, however, is both a great thing and quite a dangerous concept, all at the same time. It's by no means easy to control and will take more than a few attempts to master. Ultimately you're better off with leaving the keeper in automatic mode unless you seriously want to get hammered 20 nil.    A slightly more weighty new feature, however, and one that truly signals a new direction for the series, is the 'Be A Pro' challenge, where you take control of one player throughout a season and work within a team. It operates in much the same way as when you play in multiplayer, except this time it's the computer passing you the ball. It's an interesting approach and a new twist to the concept, but some fans may find it frustrating not being at the centre of the action (while others will no doubt love marking opposing players), and it can definitely be galling when you pass to the computer only for it to lose possession, or you make a run with a clear goal scoring opportunity, only for the AI to decide not to send the ball your way. On the flipside, there is nothing quite as satisfying as instigating a move with some quick one touch passing, then sitting back to watch the computer finish the run off in spectacular fashion. Just like the real thing then.   Another new feature exclusive to this release is the organic 'building block' system, where you can combine tricks and skill moves together to recreate signature moves from real-world superstars or simply to better define your own style of play. There's also the ability to capture a video of your best moves and goals in game and upload them to the FIFA 08 website to show off your style around the globe.     The AI now features a 35-point decision engine which process 1,000 potential options and reactions every second in real-time. Collectively that's more that 60,000 options every minute. That sheer figure will prevent you from seeing the same animations time and time again, and it also makes the gameplay far more varied; a move or a goal which worked once, might not work again for some time. No more of the 'cut in from the left and shoot in the keeper's blind spot' action.   The interface and menus are now more comprehensive than they've ever been. From detailed analysis of pitch possession and shot placement, right through to man of the match ratings and individual stats on how each player performed, it's both far-reaching and engaging. The various menus are transparent, slick and intuitive, and who wouldn't love being able to practice shooting using Ronaldinho while waiting for the game to load?   It's a polished product, no doubt, and this extends to the commentary by the legendary Martin Tyler. Detailed and accurate descriptions abound during games, discussing everything from specific information on certain players, through to wider talk of successful eras for your team, as well as dates, history and dramatic matches. And another nice touch that was absent from previous instalments is the fact that when a player scores, their name is read aloud over the stadium PA system. It's a small point but definitely helps make games feel true to life.   On the eye-candy side of the equation FIFA 08 doesn't disappoint. As you'd expect, an array of official stadiums have been authentically re-created complete with new pitch designs (horizontal stripes, large squares, small squares etc) and much more prominent weather effects. Old Trafford and Arsenal's new Emirates Stadium in particular look stunning.   Indeed, playing at Old Trafford at night in the rain is a mesmerising experience. Fog lights filter down onto the pitch and a dark gloom hovers around the sides of the ground. Compare that to FIFA 07 - where playing at night simply involves seeing the sky dark as it pans around the stadium - and you'll see how much effort the team has put in on the environments.     The players look better too, more closely resembling the physical appearance of their real life counterparts. Extra detail has been added to the hair and facial expression of players, although some leave a little to be desired. Guess that's what happens when you have more than 15,000 players in the game.   Speaking of which - great news for Australian fans is the inclusion of the A-League, so you can now pit Sydney FC's  Juninhio up against the likes of Petrovski from the Central Coast Mariners. Of course, this game is about far more than just the A-League - there's a tremendous amount of depth, from playing in official leagues from around the world, to official cups and up to 60 tournaments to compete in. And don't forget the online leagues and more interestingly the introduction of interactive leagues where weekly-podcasts are made available by the development team at EA.  Its been a long time coming, but it seems that EA has finally created, tweaked and bolstered the FIFA legacy into a lean, fluid and engaging game. With many of the best elements from previous FIFA titles, along with a few ideas from Pro Evolution Soccer, the FIFA series has been propelled to an entirely new level. With Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 just around the corner, EA are no doubt hoping that - just like Real Madrid and Manchester United did last season  FIFA will reclaim its crown as THE soccer series.", "date": "Sep 26, 2007"}
