Though the company no longer exists anymore, Atari Corp. produced a ton of extremely innovative and historically significant titles in its two decade lifespan...and Infogrames, the current rights-holder of Atari Corp. games (Midway retains the licenses for Atari Games), put Digital Eclipse to the task of reproducing six of Atari's arcade titles that shipped back in the late 70s and early 80s. As accurately as these games are represented on the Game Boy Advance (they are near-perfect versions), they're not quite as faithful in gameplay since many of these games utilized specialized controllers in their original designs. If you're willing to overlook the GBA's control shortcomings, though, you've got another six great classic games to toy around with on the handheld. Features Six classic arcade emulations Trivia challenge Single and two player modes (single system) Only for Game Boy Advance  Digital Eclipse is definitely not new to the classic gaming scene...in fact, this team pretty much pioneered the whole commercialization of emulated classic arcade titles on newer system hardware. On the Game Boy Advance, Digital Eclipse uses a technique called ~Meta-Emulation~ to get these six games to run faithfully on the handheld...the GBA hardware's emulating most of the code, but the development team definitely had to reprogram some bits in order to make the conversions come out 100%. All of these games are direct versions of the original games; nothing's been added or updated to their designs.  Asteroids is definitely one of the most recognizable of this half-dozen package. In this design, you're a ship trapped in the middle of an asteroid belt filled with a never-ending supply of space rocks. The challenge is to simply stay alive, blasting the huge boulders into stones, stones into pebbles, and pebbles into space dust. When all the rocks have been eliminated, another wave comes rolling in. Occasionally large and small UFO ships sail into range, causing more havoc on the rocks and, obviously, you. Simply rotate your ship and blast away...or, if you're feeling gutsy enough, thrust around the screen to go on the offensive or defensive. And if worst comes to worse, you can always use the hyperspace to pop up in a random location. The GBA conversion is extremely faithful because the developers accurately recreate the original game's black-and-white vector graphics on the handheld. Sure, it may look bland and boring without realistic colors, but this is the way the game appeared in arcades almost 25 years ago...and even with the Game Boy Advance's much lower resolution, Asteroids looks like Asteroids on the LCD screen.  Battlezone is a nice addition to the package, but it's admittedly the dullest game in the compilation. This classic arcade title puts you inside the cockpit of a tank on an open field of geometric shapes and opposing vehicles. It's a simple task of maneuvering your tank left, right, backwards and forwards, putting the bad guys in your sights and pulling the trigger to turn them into five easy pieces. You'll have to be quick, because they're out to do the same to you...and if a bullet fires out of their cannon, you're pretty much screwed. Like Asteroids, this game utilizes vector-based graphics...but the original arcade machine used color overlays to spruce up the image...and the GBA emulates this near perfectly on the lower resolution screen. This conversion simplifies the original arcade version's complex control scheme with something a bit more intuitive, which admittedly makes the game a lot easier to play. Hitting select at any time during the action will change the controls to something that mimics the arcade control yoke...but you better be prepared, it's pretty awkward without a learning session.  Centipede is here in fine form, and is arguably the most enjoyable game in the package because of its non-stop, fast-paced action. As a non-descript sprite moving around the bottom of the screen, you'll have to survive giant centipedes, spiders, scorpions and fleas by blasting them with your zapper. Hitting a centipede in a segment will separate it into two independently moving centipedes...and if these guys hit a poisoned mushroom left behind by a scorpion, they'll dive down to the bottom of the screen. It takes a zoned-out mind to keep control of the situation...and it only gets harder as the game goes on. The emulation here is spot-on, especially with the ability to change the screen orientation. The arcade version actually used a vertically-positioned monitor (a normal screen that's been rotated 90 degrees, making it taller than it is wide), and by hitting the Select button at any time during the action, you can actually play Centipede by rotating the Game Boy Advance 90 degrees as well. In fact, this is the preferable way of playing the game, since the pacing feels a bit off when in the default, squished ~widescreen~ mode. The programmers worked the original's trackball controls as tightly as they could on the GBA's D-pad...it's a cinch getting used to it because Centipede's been accurately moved to several non-trackball systems in the past two decades.  Missile Command is a great classic shooter, with no way to really win the game. It's the way it's been designed...one way or another, the cities you're protecting are eventually going to bite the big one. But you'll have to do your best, targeting incoming missiles with your own, destroying them as they descend into view. You've only got ten missiles per your three turrets, with the center turret firing faster than the two on either perimeter. Whatever you do, don't run out of firepower...or it's goodbye cityscape. The Game Boy Advance version is a decent translation, but it suffers from two problems: minor slowdown, and loose control. When the screen fills with detonating missile explosions, the action takes a bit of a hit as the program code tries to keep up its emulation. But that's the minor issue versus the game's control issues; the original arcade game used a huge trackball to precise control over the crosshair. On the GBA, this control's been moved to the D-pad...but the analog ~feel~ remains, and the crosshair drifts a bit after lifting off the D-pad. The drifting crosshair does make the conversion play a bit sloppier than previous conversions on older game systems...it takes a bit to get used to.  Super Breakout is a simple game with a simple challenge: keep a ball (or two or three) in play by hitting it with a paddle. Score points by knocking out bricks hovering above your paddle. Super Breakout features three gameplay modes: Double, Cavity, and Progressive, each offering its own twist to the same gameplay. Like Centipede, Super Breakout can be played in a vertical mode, the orientation that the original arcade game was designed. But this makes the paddle much thinner than the standard GBA widescreen mode, so your best bet is to play it in its defaulted orientation. The problem with Super Breakout is obvious: playing it with a digital pad is the pits. Really. This game absolutely needs to be played with a rotating, analog knob, the way it was designed to be played. Nothing else will do.  You just can't make Super Breakout fun with a digital pad, no matter how hard you try. It's nice to see this game in its original form, but I honestly won't play the GBA version willingly.  Tempest is a wild and crazy, colorful and demented non-stop 3D shooter, emulated in fine form on the Game Boy Advance. Controlling a stapler-remover-looking object, you have to rotate around a wireframe web, shooting incoming enemies before they touch you. If the action gets too rough, you can always pull out the Superzapper, eliminating all on-screen enemies in a single blast. The GBA version emulates the original's full color vector graphics accurately on the less-sharp LCD screen, both in a widescreen orientation and the original's vertical mode...but what the GBA can't do is simulate the game's knob controller. As good as this version is on the handheld, players can't spin around the web faster than the digital pad control's programmed to spin it. It's still a great game, but the knob control is definitely missed. Folks already practiced up with the Atari Jaguar's Tempest 2000, though, will pick this version up right way, since the digital controls for the GBA version are so close.  And if you're all gamed out, the design team put together a few dozen trivia questions for folks who think they're all that in the category of classic Atari games. The challenge is to answer a series of multiple choice questions in the shortest amount of time...if you get three questions wrong, the challenge is over. This is a great addition, though it would have been a bit more historically significant if answering the questions with the correct response elaborated on the information tidbits. As far as accurately representing the look and programming of the classic games, Digital Eclipse did a fantastic job on Atari Anniversary Advance. The games are a great diversion on the Game Boy Advance. The problem, though, is that most of these games utilized proprietary controls that the system can't emulate...so the original games' feel just can't be matched on the handheld. But this compilation does its darndest to make these games fun in portable form...and it's pretty successful for the most part.", "date": "Apr 4, 2002"}
