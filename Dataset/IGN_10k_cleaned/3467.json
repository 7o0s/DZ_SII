{"name": "The Jungle Book", "name_review": "The Jungle Book", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/03/03/the-jungle-book", "text": "Walt Disney's adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book isn't new to the videogame scene by any means, as several companies have brought renditions to game systems several years back. The game that Ubi Soft decided to produce for the Game Boy Advance, however, is nowhere near as interesting or fun as what past game designers have created in the past; granted, this game is obviously aimed at the younger crowd, but even that demographic needs something far more interesting than what was produced here. Features Dozens of puzzles Several mini-game boss battles Password save Only for Game Boy Advance Walt Disney's The Jungle Book is nothing more than a repackaging of the early Game Boy puzzle game Brain Drain, wrapping that design around a rather silly exploration and collection game and calling it an ~adventure.~ Brain Drain is a bit like a sliding tile game where players rotate groups of four icons at a time in a grid of different shapes, aligning the tiles in the same formation as the key at the top of the screen. Complete that specific pattern before time runs out and you'll move on.  The puzzle game itself wouldn't be so bad if the designers didn't show gamers how to solve each puzzle at the beginning of the challenge; that's right, when a new puzzle is booted up, the game visually shuffles the tiles in six moves, and any keen gamer that's paying attention can just reverse the order and slide them back. True, it's shuffled rather quickly, but kids are pretty bright these days. The puzzle design isn't terribly difficult even if you wanted to close your eyes during the shuffling phase, but at least they get tougher deeper into the game, with more shapes to deal with as well as ~gaps~ that make grouping four tiles together a bit more difficult.  These puzzle games are interspersed in a tedious wandering phase through a top-down environment, collecting fruits and idols in order to unlock still screens from the original film.  The rest of the game is comprised of simplistic challenges based around situations from the first movie. Players will meet up with Kaa the snake and break from his hypnotic gaze by rapidly hitting A and B, or riding down the river on Baloo's belly all the while jumping fish and ducking branches. But these challenges are few and far between, and the designs aren't exactly what one would consider ~creative~ or ~original.~ The puzzle game could barely stand on its own as a mini-game, but in The Jungle Book it takes up more than 90 percent of the game design.  The developers must have seen that some (most) people might not want to wander around the jungle collecting coconuts, so they offered a secondary option in the menu system: Puzzle Mode. Basically, this lets players solve all the puzzles without the mess of the exploration mode. This would have been a great addition had the designers remembered to offer a way to save their progress in the middle of this mode; every time players start this mode, it's from the beginning, at the most basic puzzles. Even if the players have already solved these puzzles and reached the more difficult challenges several dozen puzzles deeper, they have to start from Square One.  The game's graphics are clean and vibrant, and uses the art from the movie in good form. There are tiny FMV clips to collect and watch, but they don't last more than a couple of seconds apiece. The game's action is accompanied by a really catchy jazz soundtrack, but for some reason it doesn't look like the actual songs from the film have been put into this GBA title. The worst element, thoug: the game requires players to jot down an awful eight character password that consists of both uppercase and lowercase letters as well as numbers and odd shapes. The password doesn't show up until the end of a level, and in some cases that actually takes a long time to accomplish. For a children's game, that's just being a bit too unfair. This game is entirely misleading; it honestly should have been subtitled so as not to be confused with the past (and far better) Jungle Book action games previously released. There's nothing entirely wrong with this game if all you want is a simplistic puzzle game, but you're not going to get much more enjoyment out of it if you're looking for more ~meat~ in the presentation. And of all things, the password save is just awful -- developers need to keep these simple, especially when it comes to a younger-skewing GBA game like this one.", "date": "Mar 3, 2003"}
