Super C, the game that came out in-between those two, has never been as widely known  which is a bit odd, but also understandable. It did, after all, disconnect itself from the Contra name. And it didn't innovate a whole lot over the original. And it even weakened and altered the Konami Code, cutting the bonus you'd receive down to just 10 men instead of three times that amount.    So hindsight can give us a glimpse into why Super C isn't heralded as highly as its older and younger brothers  and an opportunity to right that wrong. The truth is that while Super C may not be as classic and memorable an experience as the other two old-school Nintendo Contras, it's still a solid and highly enjoyable run-and-gun experience. Especially with two players.   The story finds, as is often the case, that the devilish bad guy thought dead in the first adventure is really still alive and plotting revenge against our heroes. In Super C, that bad guy is the alien Red Falcon  and our heroes are Scorpion and Mad Dog. Or Bill and Lance. Or Jimbo and Sully. Whatever. They're two guys with guns. And the Falcon has possessed the minds of the world's most major militaries, meaning our duo of heat-packing heroes have to face off this time against a mix of both army-commanded mechanical men and Alien-inspired, egg-hatched foes.   Which is really about the same mix as Contra 1. Also alike, the arsenal  from rapid-fire machine guns to flamethrowers, spreaders to laser rifles. All of these act as they did in the first Contra, excepting the flamethrower  it fires out a spherical ball of combustion that explodes on impact, rather than a swirling shot of smaller flames.      So the enemies are styled the same, the heroes are the same, the guns  with one exception  are the same ... where does Super C find its own individuality? Perspective, design and challenge.   First, perspective  in its introduction of the birds-eye view. A couple of the stages in Contra III were presented from an overhead viewpoint, as you looked down upon the heroes from above and rotated the stage around using the L and R buttons. But the inspiration for those two levels there were two prior levels here  stages two and six in Super C were the first to introduce overhead Contra action. The stages play out a lot like Ikari Warriors or Jackal, as you're deprived of your ability to jump in favor of the increased power to move in any of eight directions. You also walk a bit slower than normal, so positioning yourself well is key  the enemies' ordnance comes in slowly, most times, so you should be able to preserve your stash of lives.   The second, design  though the other six, side-scrolling levels don't initially appear too dissimilar from what Contra 1 did first, each level is laid out with more depth and detail here. The big addition is inclined slopes. Every surface in the first Contra was flat, and every side-scrolling level was either a direct march to the right side of the screen with no change in altitude, or else a direct vertical climb straight up with no side-to-side. Super C's structure is more dynamic, with big jumps and long hills. The game even starts with a two-screen-long leap into action from a hovering helicopter.   Third and final, the challenge. Super C isn't as hard as Contra or Contra III. But it's also not as generous as its predecessor  the 10-men cheat code offered here won't give you near as much room for error as the 30-man Konami Code that came before it. It's probably balanced out, overall, but it is a bit disappointing not to have the option of getting two and a half dozen extra lives in reserve. You could have quite a bit of fun being frivolously dangerous with your avatar in Contra 1  here, you'll have to take more care to keep from seeing the Game Over screen.Super C is a suitable sequel to the superior shooter from which it spawned, with a handful of not-too-major innovations and changes being introduced to differentiate it from the first classic Contra. More could have been done in developing this title in the NES era to make it stand stronger on its own, but it's still a lot of fun to run and gun here with a friend  and this Virtual Console emulation of the NES cartridge is far superior to that mess of an arcade port released last month on Xbox Live. Shooter addicts should invest first in Contra III, Gunstar Heroes and the first Contra  when it becomes available  but should also feel confident that they've find a solid experience if they spend 500 Wii Points here.", "date": "Aug 29, 2007"}
