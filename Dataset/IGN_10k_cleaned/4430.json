And while there are bound to be some folks who absolutely adore this game, Jet Fighter V tries to mix realism with accessibility and we're left with a title that's not as approachable as Top Gun and not nearly as sophisticated as Falcon 4.0. You can either think of it as either a lighthearted sim or an overly complicated arcade game. Trying to reconcile those trends for this review kind of makes my brain hurt. The same can be true of playing the game, depending on your expectations.   The single-player campaign tells the story of an attack on the southern half of the West Coast. A giant super-carrier, Korean hostility and nuclear obliteration are all on tap here. Now that I live in San Francisco, I take this kind of thing very seriously. I mean, it was all fun and games when the Commies were trying to take over the Midwest. It's not like we don't have enough corn already, right? But now that they're moving into my house, I feel the need to wax indignant.   In order to save my country (and southern California, while I'm at it), I'll have to take to the skies in one of three planes -- the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the F/A-22 Raptor or the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. (Since these are all Lockheed planes, it's odd that there's no such branding anywhere in the game.) Since this last fighter isn't even in service yet, it's kind of a coup for Jet Fighter V to allow gamers to try it out. At least, it would be if the aerodynamics or systems modeling seemed terribly different from the other two planes. Here's where I first began to suspect that the simulation had been tempered with a touch of Afterburner.    The actual flight dynamics don't seem terribly different from one aircraft to another. Sure, the speeds are different -- that's instantly apparent. But things like rate of roll and control surface response seem far too generic to justify the different plane models. Even discounting the similarity of flight models, there are a few general aggravations with the flight modeling. For one thing, I was never able to get my throttle to drop below 60%, even with the throttle pulled all the way back. Similarly, the lack of any form of air brake keeps you from having as much freedom of movement as you ought to. Sure, turn-and-burn tactics aren't necessarily the order of the day here, but it would be nice to have more control of your speed during turns.   Other inconsistencies rankle, particularly some of the seemingly contradictory concepts behind the game. On the one hand you have hardcore features like blackouts and a one-shot, one-kill airframe. On the other hand you have nice little arrows that point you in the direction of your targeted enemy and a little pop-up on the HUD that says ~Shoot~ when you've got a good lock. And while the radar mode has been abstracted somewhat to improve its usefulness, the more sophisticated features, like functional LANTIRN and chaff systems, shouldn't be too much trouble as there's a solid tutorial that introduces most of the key concepts. What the tutorial doesn't explain is why your own electronic counter-measures would wipe out your own radar, forcing you to fly in a lowered state of awareness.    The weapons are relatively generic. For each of the planes featured here, you'll only get one of two load outs, one with an aerial focus, one with a ground focus. The basic bombs, AGMs and AAMs are functional enough but you won't get a chance to really customize your weapons systems like you might in some other flight sims. Managing the weapon profiles and such isn't much of a burden but it would be even less of one if you could actually rebind the control keys. I have a hundred-dollar flight stick on my desk and I can't even assign the basic controls to specific buttons.    If you've had your fill of the 30 or so campaign missions, you can jump into any of several instant action missions that put you right in the thick of things. There's a nice variety of mission types here and you're sure to find what you're looking for with just a little digging. Even if you don't, there's a relatively flexible mission generator that you can use to set up a number of custom engagements.    Though the team had promised internet-based multiplayer modes, no such features are present in the game. We've heard that the feature will be patched in later but, so far, nothing's been posted. You can play the game over a LAN in the meantime and hope that your human wingmates show greater skill (or at least greater animation and personality) than your AI wingmates. You have very little control over the AI wingmen and even their voiceovers are so tightly scripted that you'd need some axel grease and a crowbar to pry them loose.   Built on the Renderware engine, the graphics are probably the best thing about the game and the clouds are the best part of the graphics. They seem terribly substantial here and provide the same kind of concealment you'd find in real life. They're the biggest drain on system resources though, so you'll need a hefty system to get them to display in all their glory. Fortunately the system requirements are relatively light for a game like this.   The ground is built using over 90,000 miles of satellite-mapped terrain of California and Nevada. Up in the air, it all looks great. I even like how the texture is slightly different for Las Vegas, for instance. Sure, the city layouts seem a bit off but the large downtown skyscrapers here and there add a nice touch. But as impressive as the ground is from 10,000 feet, it wasn't meant to be viewed from below 1,000 feet. Drop down this low and you'll begin to notice some muddiness in the textures and an overall flatness to the water textures, as if someone had spilled blue paint on the ground. Flying over a city gives you the impression of sailing over so many non-descript cardboard boxes and, while it does a pretty good job of selling the sense of speed, you'll hardly care to take in the sights.    In terms of sound, we're once again securely in the realm of the average. I like some of the effects alright; afterburners, missiles and such sound fairly convincing if a tad wimpy. You may get a bit of a rush just listening to wind fly past your cockpit but you'll have to turn down the tiresome Top Gun-style music first.  Most games can't successfully straddle the fence between hardcore and arcade sensibilities. Those that try run the risk of alienating at least one of the camps of gamers and quite frequently alienates them both. In their never-ending quest to reach as broad a market as possible, developers are hedging their bets and delivering products that they know won't challenge those at the top of the gaming pyramid. But my criticisms of Jet Fighter V aren't necessarily that it's not hard enough. That's only half the story. The other half is that it includes some concessions to the hardcore crowd that are sure to irritate more casual gamers who might otherwise like the game.If you're new to sims and want to start at a higher level, or if you're an arcade flyer who wants to get his or her feet wet on a less forgiving title, then Jet Fighter V will serve -- at least until you get good enough to graduate to a more realistic sim or until you get frustrated enough to go back to a simpler title. There's just not a tremendous amount of room to please the few gamers who are currently caught between those two extremes.", "date": "Feb 5, 2004"}
