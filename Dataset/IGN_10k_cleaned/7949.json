Glu Mobile rectifies previous missteps with a new edition of Centipede that replicates the action as well as it can get without installing an actual trackball on your phone. And to up the ante, they've included a series of new game skins and power-ups that show the bug-busting classic in an entirely new light.   Control is of paramount importance with Centipede, so it is with mild relief that things play smoothly and surely on Glu's revision. With auto-fire turned on, you can glide around the bottom of the screen, taking shots as the centipede and other bugs as they weave around a field of fungus. Yes, there is a disconnect of sorts because some games can never be completely divorced from their original controls, but using the thumb pad works well enough to get the job done.   Centipede comes in an assortment of flavors, including the original black background with sound effects that sound reasonably close to the original game. As you play through the game and earn high scores, you unlock a series of themes that swap out the graphics. Contempo, for example, replaces the black field with a garden and the ship with a little warrior, not entirely unlike the side art on the cabinet. Fire turns the garden into a lava field. Robo adds pulsing TRON-like electricity to the background as a metallic centipede worms its way down the screen. These are smart additions that add value to the game.   The extra Power-Up mode tinkers with the established formula by adding new weapons. If Glu had only offered this without the original game, Centipede would have been a disappointment. But having it as a sideshow full of bombs, explosions, and lasers adds yet more play value to a game that fans would have likely already bought on sight.
