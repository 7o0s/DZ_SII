Years of first person shooters have taught us that the first shot is more of a warning than a threat, and if we can just get to a health pack, everything will be all right. All of that is about to change. With new games like Rainbow Six and the upcoming Thief, players are meeting enemies that are stronger, faster, and better armed than they are. Those hard-core warriors who were mowing down their Quake opponents with headlong rushes into combat are now being dropped by unseen foes armed with sniper rifles. Yes, there's a new element of fear in the air, and we here at IGN-PC like it a lot. So do the folks at Pyro Studios. With their latest game Commandos, Pyro is injecting new-life blood into the real-time strategy genre with a game that will have players on the edge of their seats, waiting for their chance to strike.  The premise is relatively simple. You are the commander of an elite Allied commando unit in World War II. Your squad consists of six men, each of whom has been selected for certain talents which only they possess. In your first mission, you have access only to a Green Beret who is adept at close quarters killing and feats of strength, a Marine who can use scuba gear to pass undetected beneath the water and kills quietly with his spear-gun, and a Driver who is expert both at piloting whatever vehicles you find and at mowing down enemies with his sub-machinegun. Later you get access to the rest of the crew, which includes a sapper who loves to set traps and blow things up, a sniper who can take the heads off your enemies at range, and a spy who infiltrates enemy camps and distracts the other side's soldiers. You begin the game in Norway during the early days of the war, and work your way through 20 missions that take you through North Africa, France, and finally into Germany itself. After each mission, you receive a score, and eventually, if you're good enough, get promoted through the ranks.  The gameplay itself is very cool. Using your mouse or the provided hot-keys, you move each one of your men through the levels with a point-and-click interface that isn't really all that different from games like StarCraft or Command and Conquer. As you move each character around the screen, their individual backpack shows up in the bottom corner of the screen and acts as a menu for the actions that are specific to that soldier. The idea behind most of the missions is to sneak into a heavily guarded enemy compound and to then destroy something inside. While killing the guards is always an option, it's usually a really bad one. Each of the guards has their own line of sight and movement patterns, and if they get a look at you, or if they spot a dead comrade, they come looking for you, usually screaming for their friends the whole time. Since the game plays out in real time, you really get some of the rush of lying in the dark, waiting for the right time to sneak up behind a patrolman and cut his throat. Each of the men you have with you on a mission are be there for a reason, so no one is expendable. Lose a man, and the mission's over.  While all of this is nice on a surface level, there's a lot going on beneath that's pretty amazing as well. Enemy soldiers feature fascinating AIs, and try to capture or shoot you based on their passivity level and whether or not they have seen you hurt any of their friends. If you select the eye icon at the top of the screen and then click on one of the soldiers, a two-toned green cone shows light in front of the trooper. The lighter green area closer to the soldier is the area in which he can see directly. Unless you're camouflaged, or an object blocks the soldier's view, you can be sure that he calls out an alert if you wander into this zone. The dark green zone is a semi-safe zone. If you are lying prone, the soldier walks by you without noticing, but if you are standing in this area, you are seen. Soldiers can also hear. If you fire a weapon that makes sound within earshot, they come running to investigate, and depending on whether or not they are a play-it-by-the-rules kind of soldier or not, they may raise the alarm before they come. The overall effect is human-like realism. You never know exactly what an enemy soldier will do in a given situation.  Commandos does have a few serious drawbacks. The first, and most serious, is that the game's about as linear as they come. Each mission has a very definite ~right way~ to finish it. While the very clever may find another way to tackle a given mission, most of them are set up to allow you only one very specific way of accomplishing your goal. Sometimes this can get pretty frustrating when you can't quite sort out what it is that you're expected to do next. Sometimes, the only real way to make forward progress is to save the game, and then send your men out into harm's way to find out how the enemy soldiers are going to react. Once you have everyone's pattern's down, you can formulate a plan and win the level. The next issue I had with the game was its relatively small number of missions. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately, depending on how you look at it) this is pretty much canceled out by my final problem with the title. Commandos is hard. I mean REALLY hard. Each mission took me hours (and in more than one case, days) to sort out, and even then, I often barely made it. This is not a game for people who give up quickly.  Action fans probably aren't going to like Commandos. Although the game is very fast paced, it doesn't satisfy the urge for wanton destruction, and there's an awful lot of sitting around waiting for the right moment to act. But if you're into strategy games, own an attention span, and are looking for something that's a lot different than anything we've seen since Cannon Fodder, you owe it to yourself to give this game a try.  -- Trent C.
