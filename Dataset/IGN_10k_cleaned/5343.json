It's actually pretty rare that we run across a game this bad ... I'd rather run over it, and I'd definitely back up just to make sure it was totally destroyed.  Extreme PaintBrawl is a glorified game of capture the flag with paint-loaded guns.  The object of PaintBrawl is to find the other group's flag without being shot.  You head an 8 person squad battling against a rival team in one of 5 arenas: an urban assault course, a space themed area, a forest, a castle, and a desert setting.  If one of your players gets shot, they become unusable for the rest of the game and you then switch to another player in your group.    There is no variety of game types in PaintBrawl whatsoever and this sorely hampers gameplay.  You can't even really practice in the Practice Mode.  Instead, you're thrown into one of the 5 battlefields with no friends, no opponents, and no targets.  I guess you can practice how much paint you can splatter on the wall, but that's about it.  To make matters worse, your computer opponents are dead-eye shots making a practice mode that much more necessary since you are out of the game after one shot.  You hardly have a chance to fire back before you get pegged.  There is quite a selection of guns (from pistols to sniper rifles) to choose from and Head Games has a patch available that offers you access to more, but even a wide variety of armament doesn't help PaintBrawl achieve respectability.  The biggest problem that I had with this game was it's incredibly poor Artificial Intelligence, and I would go as far to say that this game has Artificial Stupidity.  After outfitting my team with guns, extra ammo, and plenty of compressed air, we entered the urban assault arena to battle it out against a rival crew.  What did the rest of my guys do?  They all ran into the wall and got stuck in a corner . . . brilliant!!!  Figuring this game had definite problems with navigating angles, I decided to give it another try in the open forest.  OK, my team performed a bit better . . . instead of running into a wall they either vibrated wildly like they were having some kind of horrible epileptic fit or fell prone and crawled back and forth in the same place.  C'mon guys, what's up with that?  How am I supposed to take on 8 other ringers just by my lonesome?  It's like you're the fly going up against Mr. Miyagi.  There is one nice thing I can say about Extreme PaintBrawl: the soundtrack was clean, crisp, and heavy ... just how I like it in a high-action game, which means that it would have fit in really with a game with some excitement.  No such luck with Extreme PaintBrawl.  The tunes range from double bass pedal heavy metal fingertapping guitar riffs to wacky barnyard animal noise mixed with power chords to a hard rock rendition of Vivaldi's Spring.  It was by far the best thing about this game and certainly the only thing EXTREME about it.   If, for some reason, you do happen to end up with Extreme PaintBrawl, I suggest you put it in a brown paper bag, place it in front of your neighbor's door, set it on fire and run like hell . . . 'cause it's going to make one raucous stink.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Oct 30, 1998"}
