Let's just skip past the fact that regardless of the number of titles out there that pretty closely resemble each other, people still go out and buy the games like they're going out of style. So in comes another one. A sequel this time building off of a lackluster preformance form the first in the series. This second attempt is most certainly better than the first one, but interface problems, pacing, and lack of personality still bring the game down into a category that won't have me readily recommending this game to anyone but someone that considers tycoon games crack of the next generation.   Like the throngs of tycoon games already on the market, Industry Giant 2 challenges players to build an economic empire under certain types of conditions. You'll enter a scenario with a starting amount of capitol and be given a goal to reach in a certain amount of time. The goals range in size and scope, but usually have to do with making your company worth a certain amount or having so much cash in the bank and so on and so forth. IG2 is set across the 20th century and will challenge you to build an empire in different decades only opening up certain products, vehicles, and technologies as time reaches the right year for it to have been developed in real life.   When entering a game, you'll be dropped onto a map with several towns scattered across it, some roads, and some resources. These resources are shown via little icons sticking out of the ground. For oil, you'll see an oil barrel sticking out of the ground, for iron ore, you see an iron construction beam type dealy sticking from the ground, glass shows bottles sticking out of the ground... you get the picture. You'll have to collect the resources by placing buildings on top of them in the right place so that you collect as much as possible. Once that's done, you'll need to move into the production phase of your enterprise by constructing factories and plants to turn these raw materials into something useful. Once you've got useable materials ready, your factories take over to take one or more of these and put them together to form some sort of product from furniture to electronics to sunscreen. You'll then need to sell this to the public by placing shopping centers in the metropolitan areas of the map. Then, every month, the stores will sell as much as the city can support, giving you your hard earned money so that you can expand your commercial empire.    Sure, it sounds simple enough, but you have to worry about some other things as well, the biggest of which is shipping. The materials and finished products don't magically transport themselves from building to building. Your infrastructure will have to consist of a bunch of warehouse dumps for your products to sit that are in a certain range of your factories and transportation. Transport comes in the form of trucks, trains, boats and planes depending on the decade your game is in. For trains and trucks you'll have to have a starting and ending point for the route along with tracks or roads to travel across. Planning all of these things out can be interesting and more than a little expensive, so you'll want to make sure you have enough money in the bank to get the whole thing rolling. You'll probably spend a considerably longer amount of time planning out your transport routes than actually playing around with your business.   Planning is definitely the key to this game.  Making a small mistake can cost you the game early on. What's wrong with including an undo button? If there was an undo button, then I can't find it. Accidentally placing a building in the wrong place would cause me to have to reload half the time. Putting buildings in the wrong place can cause all sorts of problems and deleting them doesn't give you any money back at all, in fact it costs you money so you get doubly pumped.   The problem with setting buildings in the wrong places is that they may be out of range of storage, or if they are storage, out of range of transportation. The other problem of getting the twitch in your finger and accidentally placing a factory too near a building is that these industrial buildings give negative press to the city so people won't want to move there and expand it as much. The cities expand and grow themselves, you have nothing to do with the planning, and you want them to expand as much as they can so you can sell more products and make more money.   Unfortunately, you'll also be sitting around waiting. IG2's pace is not exactly exciting. You'll often end up sitting around waiting to make enough money to buy the next part of your industry. There were stretches when I seriously wouldn't be doing anything except for scrolling around the map for 10 minutes at a time. And I don't know about you, but when I don't have a whole lot to look at, I get bored.   Industry Giant 2 has certainly improved on the original game, but it seems that the Germans haven't yet figured out how to be fun. Stop being boring Germany! You're hurting the fun center in my brain and making me into a slug that only knows how to buy and trade washing machines... and this kind of thing really isn't going to turn the ladies on in a conversation and I need all the help I can get.   I know I'll get some flak for saying these kinds of things, but before everybody gets too riled up... well, as riled up as you can get about a game like this, it's not a bad little tycoon game. The workings and gameplay are actually fairly tight despite some glaring oversights in the interface. What the game really lacks is any kind of fun personality. With most of these tycoon/city building types of games, there's some distinct flavor and style that accompanies them. Industry Giant 2 is so bland it makes everything around it lack flavor as well. Where are all of the nice building animations? Pretty much all I can see are the trains, boats and cars moving around. There's some animals roaming the map, but my focus isn't there. It's on the buildings. Sure, some of the buildings do have animations, but they're choppy and framed making them unwelcoming. Unfortunately, for me, Industry Giant 2 is about as charming as a plain cake without any frosting. Sure it may taste all right and may be filling, but there's no fun on top.   The graphics engine itself isn't so bad. Resolution cranks to 1600x1200 and you can seamlessly and smoothly zoom in and out for nice close-ups and far back views for better placement planning. Maps can be absolutely gigantic! There were cases where my empire didn't even come close to reaching outside of the middle of the maps before I had completed the scenario.  If you're really into tycoon games, then you may want to pick this one up. If you're only into them for games like SimCity and Roller Coaster Tycoon, don't pick this game up, your friends will find you dead from drowning in pool of your own saliva. At its core, Industry Giant 2 is a decent management game, but there has to be more for regular folks like me to get into it. There has to be some personality and pizzazz. In fact the one thing I found incredibly funny and entertaining were the giant golden snails that would make their way down the screen when loading up a saved game after just starting up the program. Unfortunately trying to take a screen made the snails go away so I can't prove it. Industry Giant 2 is an average game in the tycoon genre but should be good for those that just can't get the itch to play a game like this out of their systems.", "date": "Sep 19, 2002"}
