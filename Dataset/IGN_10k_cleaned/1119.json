Come on folks, it's not like Tetris, Scrabble 2, or BeachHead 2000 push the technological envelope.  Long, long ago in a decade far, far away, it didn't take a gig's worth of art resources or multiplayer support files to captivate an audience.    Bad press preceding it or not, when first Gromada, an action-shooter imported from Russia, fell into my grubby paws, it went over well because the product appeared to have the trimmings of addictive retro gameplay scribbled all over it.  First impressions foretold that the titles's plot was superficial, its action mindless, and the resident special effects factor high.  What's more, attention span demands were minimal and the learning curve nonexistant.  For ditzy players like myself, who get all tingly thinking of how we'll be able to blow crap sky high while chatting on the phone, chewing gum, and rubbing our bellies at the same time, nothing could be better.  Or so I thought.  Had Interplay published the game, it would have sported the catch phrase ~by tank nuts for tank nuts.~  Gromada's crawling with 10-ton, wickedly treaded behemoths that bristle with lasers, machine guns, and rockets.  As an eccentric tinkerer who's been betrayed by his co-workers, you'll have to use your 'baby girl,' a futuristic prototype named Kassandra, to mow all of 'em down in cold blood.  Missions, accessed from the world map, amount to nothing so much as lengthy battles between Kassandra and (you guessed it) enemy tanks, turrets, production facilities, and airborne units.  Oh sure, from time to time you'll have to seek out keys, lay waste to enemy strongholds and locate weapon upgrades, but vehicular combat steals the show.  Keyboard and mouse control options are available, but if you choose to rely on the AI's pathfinding routine, be advised that the pathfinding routines couldn't relocate their way out of a paper bag.  And though that's an annoying bug in general, it's a lethal flaw when contending with tremendously difficult missions and enemy weaponry that kills with one hit. I don't care how much ammo you've got left or how speedy those wheeled chassis are, but neither does a damn bit of good if you're caught behind the root of some freaky alien tree while a mine casually drifts up your rear end.  And hold onto your seat for this one.. did we mention you can't save while in the middle of a level?  Hope you like restarting sixty bazillion times.  Taking stock of Gromada's shortcomings, it comes as something of a shock that the game looks just as good as it does on the back of the box.  Viewed from an overhead perspective, backgrounds are filled with fronds of alien vegetation and stalks of colored goo that bob in the wind while translucent spheres and rarer oddities hover overhead.  Dazzling explosions accompany the destruction of a foe, sending pieces of scrap metal rocketing off in random directions.  Mmmmmmmm... shrapnel.  Heck, it'll be three, maybe four hours before you're tired of seeing the same pyrotechnics and hearing a tedious reptition of gimpy, muted sound effects.    Hel-lo, Bethesda, where's the killer soundtrack, the goes from zero to ~holy frijole who dropped the nuclear bomb in here~ in 6 seconds weaponry, and the finely tuned gameplay we demand from this era's arcade games?  Gromada's not bad, it's true, but there's just no pep in its step, no sizzle in its deadly shenanigans.  Gaming's come a long way since the bygone days and without a catchy hook or jaw-dropping special effects to convince us otherwise, why should we bother revisiting the past?  -- Scott Steinberg", "date": "Jul 22, 2000"}
