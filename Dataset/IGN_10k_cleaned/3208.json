{"name": "Project Nomads", "name_review": "Project Nomads Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/15/project-nomads-review", "text": "What do you do when your world is an exploded, disjointed collection of giant rocks separated into three tiers and your friends get captured by a strange race of homicidal robots called Sentinels just before your plane plummets into one of these mysteriously hanging rocks, inadvertently freeing some floating blue guy named Basaltface?  Trust him and shoot things at his command.  Project Nomads seems original on the surface, and in some ways it is. But, just beneath its supple, smooth, glowing, buttery skin lies a monotonous soul draining game with no real flavor or draw. It's that piece of steak that looks good only because it's soaked in A1, when in actuality it's charred to a crisp. It's that Ferrari kit car, all pretty and red with no real substance. It's just like that time you looked at your friend's roof, put down your beer, and came to the brilliant conclusion that it'd be a great idea if you jumped off of it holding a big patio umbrella. You'll totally fly. It's just like a parachute.   The meat is poison. The car isn't real. Jumping off a roof with an umbrella results in a broken ass.   Because the world of Project Nomads, Aeres, is comprised of big giant rocks, players logically control one such rock through somewhere around 25 mind numbing and frustratingly tedious missions. Well, players sort of control one such rock.  Nomads is separated into several game types that can all be experienced at once. To its credit, the game features a seamless integration of these vastly differing control styles. Cooler still, the switch comes amidst a startlingly beautiful and stylized game world.   Nomads is the kind of pretty appreciated not only because of its technical excellence, but because of its artistic fineness. Bright and vivid colors saturate the land. Shadows drape. Textures are crisp and detailed. Particle effects are vivid and bright. Designs and artwork are original and appropriately outlandish but still always welcoming. It's a truly brilliantly crafted world complete with a moderately engaging fiction, admittedly partly due to the design itself, but also to the allure that gallivanting about in fighter planes, a jet pack, and a floating island that could have been used in some remarkable way carries with it. But where the aesthetics and idea excel, the game fails, miserably.     Every part of Project Nomads' play, in every mode at every time, is so riddled with problems and inconsistencies that the whole itself suffers. Throwing in an extra bit of cool is only a plus if it doesn't adversely affect the greater package. In this case it does.   On-rails shooting is tiresome. Controlling a turret means having to haphazardly shoot down a variety of stationary and mobile enemy forces.   Base building/pseudo strategy is forced and carries little of the positives and much of the negatives associated with traditional RTS titles (running around repairing and performing menial, tedious tasks). Building things and switching between them is very structured -- you don't just place what you want, where you want. Even though a number of structures can populate the island, and switching between some of the active ones is as easy as pressing tab, running around in a panic trying to repair things and not waste energy is what the game's sadly all about. The huge flames coming from your last level three cannon are a bad thing.   Through the watch tower, a structure you can't even look around in when you're using it (some goddamned watch tower), it is possible to move the island. Even though Project Nomads is presented in a glorious 3D world that begs for more exploration in, at the very least, a somewhat non-linear fashion, all island movement is restricted to waypoints. Sometimes there are multiple waypoints in a map, and you can even bring the island to a complete stop, but the end result is a big block that goes only where the game lets it go. Unfortunately, the game is designed in such a way that each mission is strung together right after the next, waypoint to waypoint to waypoint. If you haven't died by the end of it, then chances are you've completed it. It's one big long line.  Flying, in whatever form it takes, is the one true endearing characteristic of the game. Played out more like Red Ace Squadron than Crimson Skies, it too again bogged down by a complete lack of balancing. Shoot forever, fly away and let base die. Using your character's jetpack and planes, it's possible to move from your own island and explore neighboring ones, but then that only eventually leads to the walking component, which is in and of itself, broken.   Walking, clearly the most unworkable of the modes, is an awkward and unwelcome attempt at blending some kind of exploratory aspect into an otherwise completely linear and often times hard to figure out game. It's not even played with a classic mouse look when on the islands, but rather a restricted form of it. And there is no strafe. In fact, there are no control options at all, so what you got is what you got. It all feels rather clumsy. Floaty and plagued with some questionable collision detection, actually walking around other islands is the least enjoyable part of the game, overtly simplistic puzzles dot the path and enemies try and hurt you, but the real thrill is in the air.   After you get passed the initial, strictly on-rails segments, Nomads opens up a bit (a very small bit). More automation helps alleviate the burdens of managing a flying carrier (turrets can shoot by themselves and planes can fly by themselves), but questionable AI in each department prevent such computer controlled tasks from ever being trustworthy. Sending planes out on their own means losing them. Leaving your base to its own defenses means cleaning up the rubble when you return. And it just keeps getting harder and slower.  Salvation comes from foolish optimism. Because it's so pretty and such a good idea, that huge, nagging, naive part in all of us keeps hoping that something better will eventually come. And so we play on. With each passing mission we see cooler surroundings and even more beautiful artwork and graphics than before. Mr. Na?ve beckons for further play, comforting us with whispers of a better plane mission, a more exciting on-foot one, a fast and adrenaline pumping on-rails chore, and maybe even an eventual code that unlocks the ~good slider~ in a retooled options menu. It never happens. But suddenly we find ourselves staring at a completed game and wondering why we went through it all.      So even though we'd all like to envelop ourselves in any one of the gameplay modes, developing some kind of strategic attack plan, engaging in rousing dogfights like the ones we remember from Crimson Skies, exploring a wondrous world and meeting wondrous people, the game simply will not let us. It's one broken, if beautiful attempt at originality after another -- a giant napkin at a bar with a lot of good ideas on it that the sleepy drunk will never be able to perfect. But who needs invigorating, fresh, or even perfected, classic gameplay when you can quickly run back and forth while the whole mission progresses very, very slowly?  A whole lot of undelivered potential... Every aspect of the game is soaked with style and love, but not enough practical delivery.  It's truly a shame, too, because flying with a jetpack and plane are amazing additions to what could have been an awesome action title with a bit of base management. A different style of automation would have helped. The main character should have stayed at the base, where he could have moved where he pleased, launching remote controlled fighters and exploratory bots to check out the environments, leaving the player the ability to not only control the action at all times, but to also always snap back to the island and handle some enemies. In the way it is implemented, the effect of docking at a port and exploring the land is cool, but never truly enticing or deep, due again to the inherent problems associated with each mode of play.    Let's recap some of the exclamation point ridden play mechanics to make sure you fully understand them, shall we?  Battle spell those dastardly Skrits!  Translation: Shoot up the mindless alien bugs that infest the world by fighting a broken control scheme, bad collision detection and using magic that's not so magical.  Dart across the cloud covered skies in a jetpack or fighter plane!  Translation: Leave your base and actually enjoy one of the few genuinely cool aspects of the game while your automated defenses miserably fail at preventing any kind of an enemy attack. Oh, my base is destroyed. Well that's fantastic.  Control your own base and resources! Build, conquer, defend!  Translation: Build whatever you can wherever the game lets you and then upgrade it all with whatever you find. Later, you too can fail miserably as you attempt to manually control your own hellishly slow moving base all the while trying vainly to prevent an enemy attack from obliterating your hard earned level three artifacts.  Explore strange new worlds and discover mystical artifacts!  Translation: Very slowly drift around a very fixed path and then clumsily stumble about looking for little translucent representations of buildings and energy that you can use to prolong your own agony.   Meet fascinating people, both good and evil! Unravel an ancient plot of destruction! Translation: Watch wretchedly acted non-interactive sequences unfold whenever you meet someone and learn that the bugs are bad and that dude with the evil voice isn't all sunshine and rainbows.   What did you think of Project Nomads?  And then there's audio and multiplayer. The latter is the biggest load of crap in years. Again, it's massively failed delivery, potential thrown out the window, convention spat on. Some of the maps are cool or at least could be if I could connect with anyone outside my LAN without having to know their IP address by heart and randomly figure out what the hell's going on. The Instruction manual mentions LAN play, the readme also mentions Internet play. Whatever.  It's also great that I need two additional options outside of the game to start multiplayer. If there were some kind, any kind, of in-game indicators other than colored balls to help me along, that'd be great. And what would really be neato is if I could get some indication of anything. All that you hoped would be in the singleplayer, you'll foolishly hope will be in here and you'll be just as disappointed.  Voices are wretched, lifeless, and acted with no regard to the game or what it could be. The writing doesn't fare much better. There are no humorous Meccaryns, no dashing Nathan Zachary, no saucy Cate Archer. These are the standard, ~It's a video game so we don't have to try~ voices which come atop strange music that fits the bizarre feel of the world, but is perhaps sometimes misplaced (dramatic when it shouldn't be, mellow when it should be dramatic). Underdeveloped laser blasts and explosions top it off. In the end, Project Nomads amounts to a brilliantly stylized but bland, linear, tedious, and sometimes even broken action title with many boring tasks that apparently need to be completed in as unexciting a manner as humanly possible. With such a remarkable premise and design, Nomads has the uncanny ability to fail so much in so many different ways that it makes a gamer scream aloud in frustration at the often unworkable or direly needing basics. Play translates to random yelps. Neighbors will hear shouts of, ~Why didn't they do this? Why the heck did they do that? Why the hell do I have to do this? How in the - damn hell - come I can't do this?~ Then there's my personal favorite, ~Go faster, stupid!~ Each part of the game is messed up enough that even the brilliant design, inspired art, and ambitious attempt at originality can't save the whole. Notable for its try, Project Nomads is still a sorely lacking title that requires too much more work and polish to be honestly recommendable.", "date": "Nov 15, 2002"}
