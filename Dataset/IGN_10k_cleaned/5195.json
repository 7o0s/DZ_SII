{"name": "Hardwood Solitaire", "name_review": "Hardwood Solitaire", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/11/02/hardwood-solitaire", "text": "The sound of a solitaire game on Xbox likely makes your eyes roll into the back of your head. I know it was that way for myself at first, but you know what, Hardwood Solitaire is probably the best deal of the Live Arcade launch titles. Packed with more than 125 solitaire variations, including such favorites as Free Cell and Klondike, Hardwood Solitaire gives you plenty of opportunities to waste some time on Xbox, perhaps while waiting for friends to show up and play Halo 2.  Each game includes a rating for length, amount of luck involved, and difficulty. Instructions for each are also included, with animated demos to boot. While you could just buy a deck of cards for a buck and play these games on your coffee table, Hardwood Solitaire negates the annoying set-up and cleanup of real life cards.    While Hardwood Solitaire does not contain every variation of the card games you love to play by yourself, it does include all of the major ones and really all the best games. My personal favorite is now Zodiak, a game I'd never dabbled with in the past. Using two decks and a complex set-up, it's the type of game that takes just as long to deal out in real life as it does to play. That's not a problem using Hardwood Solitaire.  If you are looking for a solitaire game on your Xbox, this will do just fine. You can get the same titles on your PC, but the reasonable pricing and good offering of games makes for a nice investment if it interests you. The inclusion of custom soundtracks and some card customization are also nice bonuses.", "date": "Nov 2, 2004"}
