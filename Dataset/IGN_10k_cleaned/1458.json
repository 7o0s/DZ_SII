PlayStation, you ready?  Let's get it on!  Crave Entertainment's fighting monster is now available on both systems, and received an extremely high score on Sega's machine. Crave claims that both games are variably different, in gameplay mechanics, character creation, and more.  Whereas IGNDC ate its console-specific version up like ambrosia, I'm a little more skeptical about the PlayStation offering.  The gameplay stays true to the real Ultimate Fighting Championship for the most part, but the one-player match is a hassle.  If you buy this game, buy it for the multiplayer matches.   Gameplay The '90s brought us a generous cornucopia of good things to watch on TV.  Television's never had dirtier language, sex has never been advertised so heavily, and violence has been taken to new levels.  Although it's been popular since the days of Hulk Hogan, wrestling also is bigger than ever.  There's a big following for watching insane men punch and kick the crap out of each other.  Likewise, there's a following that denounces wrestling as a sport because it's ~fake~ -- that's where the Ultimate Fighting Championship comes in.  All styles of known human combat are incorporated.  Jiu-Jitsu, sumo, submission, kick-boxing, and more.  It's basically no-holds barred.  The only style I didn't see was drunken kung-fu.   Whether or not you're gung-ho for the television program, the game should suit your tastes just fine.  A plethora of moves and holds, such as punches, grabs, and kicks, are at your perusal, as well as almost two dozen fighters.  Playing the game is another matter altogether.  This is not a button masher like what you may be used to.  If you head into the Octagon without knowing any moves, you're as good as dead.  The UFC tournament is tough stuff, regardless of what difficulty level you set.  These matches can last mere seconds.  See, in the Ultimate Fighting Championship world, it's not all about beating your opponent around until his energy bar's at nothing.  You can literally win -- or lose -- a match within the first five seconds.  Things end so quickly that it's frustrating.  Even after having visited the training mode, I was still confused.   Match One.  You're pitted against a fairly weak fighter.  At least he seems weak.  If you try to get close to him, you'll probably land a few punches and a couple kicks.  The effect it has on his life bar is very slim.  After smacking him around several times, he grabs you and pins you to the floor. Now it's time to struggle and squirm in a last ditch effort to free yourself.  Too bad it doesn't do any good.  After he has his fun by socking you in the face once, twice, three times, he puts you into a hold, and you immediately tap out.  This results in you losing the game.  If you're lucky enough to put him into a hold and make him tap out, you'll face yet another fierce fighter.  Rinse and repeat. Needless to say, I had a hard time with it at first. If I learned anything it's that UFC has a steep learning curve, and that while it's a good game, it's also an eccentric one.   While the gameplay mechanics are realistic, the one-player game itself is lacking in variety.  From one round to the next, your opponents are pretty similar, one by one.  That's the downside to realistic fighting games.  In old-school Street Fighters or Virtua Fighters, each character has trademark moves that give him or her a specific personality.  When it comes to Ultimate Fighting Championship, it really doesn't make a difference who's picked to play. No matter which person you select to represent you in the ring, the strategy is minimal because the computer-controlled player knows what he's doing.  You don't.  If you're of a higher skill level, fending off your opponent will be easier, naturally.  At the beginning, it's hard to win your way to the top, and it's discouraging.   Upon completion of the Ultimate Fighting Championship tournament, the Road to the Championship mode will open.  Unlike the tournament, which is solely based upon winning a title belt, the Road to the Championship leaves you defending your status.  If you are able to fend off up to 19 other contenders, the true champion title will be yours.  In addition to this, you will be awarded bonus points, which you may use to boost the attributes of your own created players.  The Road to the Championship may only be engaged with fighters who have earned the belt through the UFC tournament.   The Create-A-Fighter mode is simple and effective. Like most realistic fighting games, you are able to design your own character.  You're able to choose from a selection of attributes, like stamina, life, speed, and power, which make your player unique to the Ultimate Fighting Championship world.  One thing I like is the many options available.  You can make a fighter who is good on the ground, a fighter who is good in submissions, a fighter who is good at kicking, a fighter who is good at punching, or whatever else you desire.  You can bend and shape your fighter into whatever type you'd like him to be.   Naturally, the multiplayer mode is Ultimate Fighting Championship's golden sheen.  Although it can be hard to make your computer-controlled foes eat your fists at first, the multiplayer tournament and exhibition mode give beginners an equal shot at competing.  Mindless arm and leg flailing is fun when you're fighting against someone who is just as clueless.  There's nothing better than beating a friend to hell and back, and this game provides a good opportunity to do just that.  In every single mode of play, you can use one of the characters you've saved to your memory card or pick from the normal 22.   You can choose:   Mark Coleman  Mikey Burnett Gary Goodridge Matt Hughes Eugene Jackson Kevin Randleman Tsuyoshi Kosaka Tim Lajcik Chuck Liddell Guy Mezger Tito Ortiz Pat Miletich Jermey Horn Marco Ruas Ron Waterman Pete Williams Frank Shamrock Andre Roberts Maurice Smith Evan Tanner Bas Rutten Pedro Rizzo  Crave definitely did some things different with the PlayStation version than from the Dreamcast version.  For one, there is no Career Mode, in which you could train your created characters and earn attribute points.  Although I haven't had the chance to play Crave's DC offering of Ultimate Fighting Championship, the idea that it recieved a 9.1 makes it seem like the clearly better game.  This, although loads of fun against other human players, isn't as hot in the tournament or Road to the Championship.  Nonetheless, it's realistic and entertaining.   Graphics Like its gameplay, Ultimate Fighting Championship's graphics suggest reality.  The character models are extremely detailed, and the textures are proper. Each fighter's face looks just like the real person's, as best the PlayStation can do.  For a game that's appearing near the end of this system's life cycle, it does itself justice.  The animation is smooth and almost flawless.  When the fighters punch their fists together and stretch during the introduction before rounds, it shows that the designers spent some time on making things look right.  I was really turned off by the crowd graphics, though.  The crowd is comprised of a two-frame animation that's pixelated and ugly.  Another big turn-off is how long the introductions are.  The announcer talks for eons about each contender, and then Big John McCarthy finally tells everyone to ~get it on.~ These long scenes are by-passable, but you have to press the start button five times before you can enter the match.   Sound The sound effects are good, like the constant cheer from the crowd, or the noises you and your opponents make when a fist is found in either face. Although the voice acting is good, it's a bit extensive.  The announcer talks in great detail before each match, and he hesitates too much in between some sentences.  Do we really need to hear about the character you've chosen before every single match?  Yeah, sure, we know he's 6'2 and 199 pounds.  Let it rest already.  The music that plays during the menus and other scenes isn't too bad.  Typical stuff for a ~bad boy~ fighting game: electrical guitar riffs set to a heavy beat in some situations and various electronica in others.UFC is good game. But just like so many games I've played, none of them have good single-player modes. Of the ones I've touched none have a deep, involving tournament.  But, Ultimate Fighting Championship is great with two players. There are plenty of folks out there who love punching and kicking repetitively, round after round, but I like a little color splashed into otherwise monotonous gameplay. Like I said before, this game definitely rocks with a friend.", "date": "Nov 10, 2000"}
