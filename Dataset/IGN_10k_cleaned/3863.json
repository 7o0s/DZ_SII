{"name": "Bombastic", "name_review": "Bombastic", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/08/26/bombastic", "text": "Most people believe that the puzzle genre begins and ends with Tetris; that every other puzzle game is nothing more than a clever variation on Alexey Pajitnov's brilliant mathematical invention. I'd hardly argue with the premise, but notable, even brilliant, puzzlers have come and gone since Tetris stole the world's attention in the 1980s, and Devil Dice is one of them. Capcom Entertainment acquired the rights to the sequel for the North American market and is now publishing it under the moniker Bombastic on PlayStation 2.   Published by THQ on PlayStation in 1998, the premise behind Devil Dice is to roll dice along a board, connecting same numbered die to create combinations on a fixed board, under a time limit and/or against opponents. It's interesting because it follows dice logic in a way neither related to gambling nor cards, but actual number logic. Bombastic adds a few flourishes to the already established formula including a Quest mode, explosive die, the ability to get off a die and push it, and a few extra flourishes, but it essentially delivers more of the same ~hot dice action~ to the table. Without a doubt, Capcom's pick-up was deft, and anybody interested in an absolutely knockout puzzle game should obtain Bombastic right away.   Gameplay  The concept behind Bombastic, exactly like the idea behind Devil Dice, is genius. Here, players take on the role of a nimble footed pixy, the Japanese equivalent of a Hoo (of The Grinch Who Stole Christmas fame), that scurries across the face of die in the attempt of connecting same numbers to eliminate them from the 49-square board. The object is to quickly recognize the numbers, roll the dice into place, igniting them, and then to try and create chain reactions, linking them to other sets of dice before they blow up. Players earn chain reaction points, they build up levels, and all the while they rid the grid of dice, more emerge from the ground to take their place. The gameplay is tense, electrifying and requires a certain amount of quick decision-making skills, much like Tetris, but in 3D and using die in an entirely different gameplay experience.     Once again, SCE has built the game with a few solid modes. Players get the chance to enter into Trial mode, which offers Standard mode (attempt to clear 100 levels without dying); Limited Mode (players get three minutes to achieve the highest score); and Attack mode (which requires a password permitting gamers to alter conditions). These are good modes to start in and they also serve the purpose of unlocking extras throughout the game.    While in any other game Quest (or Story) mode would be considered the core of the game, here it's just another good mode. It offers five main levels, played in linear succession, including a tutorial from a strangely penile looking man called Mr. Macho (who's wonderfully strange), and new additions to the basic gameplay. The story is essentially worthless, but it's adorable and gives you some minor reason why you're plowing through these levels. But even if the story didn't exist, it wouldn't matter. The gameplay is compelling and mesmerizing, giving players that need to replay a level again to move on.    On that same note, the Quest mode provides players some interesting new mechanical twists. Gamers can take their Aqui-chans (their names) and step off the dice in specific locations, they can push dice from the ground, and they have the ability to use items, such as speedy shoes, weights to slow them down, and detonators to instantly set off combinations. In Quest mode players fine themselves in a puzzle game that's far different than in the first iteration. The added elements reflect ideas borrowed from two other good games, Bomberman (linearly explosive squares and items of similar kinds) and No One Can Stop Mr. Domino (the addition of various planes, obstacles and oh-so-strange enemies). The end result is, fortunately, pure Bombastic (or Devil Dice 2, which I cannot get out of my head because Bombastic seems like such a broad, generic name).     The option to change ~Styles~ offers more comparisons to Bomberman, but they also enable players to play it exactly like in the first one. For instance, players can choose Sinking chains, Happy Ones, or Jumbo Style, meaning you'll jump! And then there is the ability to lift and throw a die, or to reserve, essentially doubling your chain points.      In fact, the puzzle depth is deeper and broader than before. Players must plow through Quest mode using a variety of skills, instead of simply having honed the arcade-style skill of connecting, running and connecting again. The level design provides numeric logic puzzles like those in adventure games. For instance, in the ice level players encounter an arena in which mounds of hard-packed snow must be blown up, and they must use the few dice available to explode the mounds without being destroyed themselves. In other situations, the player might make it through a narrow section but spare dice are left. Why? -- Because the levels require players to eliminate all the enemies for the highest possible points. Thus, players must think out each step before progressing.    There are even bosses at the end of each level. They too are strangely designed creatures, ranging from minimally drawn Japanese versions of the Pillsbury Dough Boy with giant butcher knives, giant cats that resembles animated sacks of potatoes and more. Needless to say, the game is just as interesting to look at from a character design stand-point as it is to play.    The Multiplayer mode is quite extensive, meaning that up to five humans can vie simultaneously using the PS2's Multitap. There aren't too many modes to choose from, however. Multiplayer is super intense. It's hectic, nerve-wracking, and sometimes simply a matter of luck if and when you win. Normally I would tell you that if you aren't good at this game don't bother playing Multiplayer, but because so much is happening at once, luck proves to be a huge part of one's survival.    The game's only weaknesses in gameplay are mostly a matter of preference. The game requires a certain knack -- a knack for quick decision making skills and a small knack for counting quickly. Just like most puzzle games. The dice logic is easy to get quickly, and the game even teaches you that on the opposite side of each dice is a number that adds to seven. So, if the top side of the die is a six, the opposite side is a one; if it's a three, the opposite side is a four, and so on.     Then there is the matter of control. It's not a problem that there is no analog control; it's only controllable via the Dpad. But the character's feet are so incredibly small, and there is no distinguishable shadow to identify where the character's feet are, it's hard to know -- or see -- exactly which square your little Aqui is standing on. Also, while the levels are usually designed with good forethought, there are numerous spots in which players cannot progress, having blown up the wrong dice, thus eliminating their only chance of progression. In that case, they must choose to lose a life and start the game over again. This gets frustrating especially in the final levels, which prove to give players a real run for their money.     Graphics  Never the kind of game to cast a spell on the jaded graphic tart, most puzzlers, including Bombastic, don't offer cutting edge graphics. Not only do the visuals in Capcom's game underwhelm, they're designed to instead relish in cute Japanese character designs, bask in simplistic flat shading, and with a happy little grin, indulge in having the very least graphic flourish possible. So, if you like your games barely textured, strangely Japanese and wildly undecorated -- with tiny little enemy bosses that resemble toasters, cats, and teardrops -- well, you'll be happy with this. In other words, falling directly into the old school sensibility of gameplay comes first (and that's it, pal), this game isn't meant to be judged by its looks.    Sound  Listing to this music makes me think that SCE went out of its way to create the ultimate Smoothie drink of Techno music merged with the score from the Teletubbies. It's bouncy, a little spacey, and filled with beeps and boops. I swear, that's the best way to describe it. In any case, the music is repetitive, catchy and shallow, the perfect videogame music to get a player into a zone and try to connect as many same sided dice as possible.    Technical fiends are sure to be disappointed: Your choices are mono or stereo, with no other options, though if you like to goof around with the BGM, you can do so here to your heart's delight. Bombastic is an excellent puzzle game that expands upon the first title (Devil Dice) with new level designs, expanded modes of play, the possibility of going for classic or new gameplay, and a genuine design that never swerves from its quirky Japanese core. If you like puzzle games, this is your bag. The only reason I would rent it first is because this game may be more of an acquired taste than a smooth, easy-to-pick-up-and-play game like Tetris. But for anybody with even a minor bit of gaming background, this is a highly addictive, incredibly brilliant puzzler that has enough depth, ingenuity and depth to keep you going for months.", "date": "Aug 26, 2003"}
