I've been pounding digits on a gamepad for over an hour, and while it's all fine and good to know you've saved the world from marauding metallic insects, I can't help but feel like all this pain and suffering was for nothing. Hasbro's line of classic arcade rehashes has been all over the board. Breakout became monotonous pretty quick, Pong was charmingly old school/new school, and Frogger 2 took hopping to new levels while Q*bert sunk it to new lows. Galaga may be one of the weaker titles to be released by the company, due to the repetitive nature of the game, and the short gameplay length. Even old school shooter fans may find themselves bored in the game, despite the variety of environments to defend.   Defend? Of course you're defending -- bugs are attacking the earth, for god's sake. They're technically robots, but the important thing to remember is that they've developed nanotechnology that could turn Earth into a playground for the beasts in almost no time at all. That's why it's your job to nip the evil in the bud by traveling to the far lengths of the solar system, and blasting everything you see. And we mean everything.  In terms of gameplay, Galaga's as simple as it gets. You fire at groups of bugs as they enter the screen and stand still in neat little patterns a la Space Invaders. Watch out for their fire, and pick up the powerups that allow you to grab one of the aliens and turn it into your partner in crime, doubling your firepower. Because we live in the magical word of 3D nowadays, the graphics have been updated to support three different views -- top down, side view, and a 3D view that has you going through canyons, dodging space wreckage, and spinning out of the way of sun flares while trying to tag the bugs flying in from all parts of the screen. Fortunately, you've got a couple of new tricks to compliment the new views. You can spin out of the way, thrust away from oncoming foes, and launch a super-bomb once a life to take out a huge chunk of aliens with one blast. Like we said, this isn't Starlancer, but it's a little more rounded than the original game.  The bugs are back, with a few different forms to deal with. You've got your classic grunts, but you'll also have to deal with special foes that launch mines and missile, bigger beasts that launch special guns to protect them while they head straight for your ship, and teardrop shaped enemies with butts strong enough to survive your mightiest laser blast. While I'd like to say that each has a different and subtle strategy in order to beat it, you can basically enjoy life by just pressing the button reaaaaaal fast and hoping things die that get in your way. The different creatures are a nice change of pace though, particularly when they get a bit more varied and aggressiveness on later planets.  What you do on a level-to-level basis, though, is anything but rounded. You'll fire a whole bunch, dodge some fire, and fire a whole bunch. You'll press that fire button so much that you may have to take a peek at your health plan to make sure you're covered for nerve damage. The different views may give you a different perspective on the environments, but the game itself does little to vary the action from the standard Galaga game. While you can argue that it's delivering what the audience payed for, I was definitely hoping for the ingenuity that I've seen come out of some of Hasbro's other arcade rehashes, particularly Frogger 2. There are moments when the game throws a curveball at you, such as a section of the game that mimics the circle motion of games like Tempest and Gyruss, and a few missions that have you shooting at special structures while dodging enemies and the terrain, as in the vector Star Wars game from years back, but even those repeat quickly over the course of the short stages, until the whole game begins to blur into a hallucinogenic twitch-fest. At one point I received a phone call while playing through the game, and completely forget it was even on while talking... not only did I not die, but I managed to get a perfect score on the bonus round, and move on to the next mission. It was at that point that I realized that if my life consisted of playing games involving shooting an infinite numbers of bugs, that I would have to either take a little vacation to the astral plane, or maybe just join a monastery that had no PCs, but good local radio stations.  The graphics are fairly solid, better than some of the other Hasbro titles, but still filled with enough texture seams and chunky letters to remind you that this is still a punched-out port that's not for the hardcore in any of us. Careening through canyons and asteroid fields was nice stuff, with rounded edges and some nice but simple lighting. Get to the Sun, however, and it's a whole different story. Bad texture edges and some really weird seams brought down the entire stage, reminding me once again why Galaga will never be invited to my next Christmas party. The sound fared much better though, with the classic Galaga theme mixed into a new modern form, and some epic keyboard tracks that reminded me of those charming, overly dramatized ~the earth needs saving~ midi songs on the last couple Final Fantasy titles.  Fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire... it'll have you smiling in nostalgic bliss... for about twenty minutes. Then you'll begin to feel a little tired, then sleepy, then a little hungry, then tired. Just about then you'll realize that you've just finished the game, which should translate into about two hours. Galaga: Destination Earth might have had some promise if it was filled with the variety given to some of Hasbro's other classic arcade titles. Instead, what you're left with is a repetitious, simplistic title that just isn't worth the effort for the end product. Keep your thumb safe and in a cool environment, and treat it to some Frogger 2 or Pong instead if you're looking for a trigger fix.   -- Vincent Lopez      Want to share your opinions with the world?
