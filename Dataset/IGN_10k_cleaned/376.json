Perhaps you recall wanting to tear your hair out in a state of acute frustration from not knowing that next link in the chain of Full Throttle or Sam and Max.  Or more recently, were you seen mindlessly roaming the streets of Westwood's Blade Runner?  Fans of these titles may feel right at home with Nightlong, but others may find its puzzle-solving nature of plot advancement a bit tedious, if not downright annoying.  Players take on the persona of Joshua Reev, a slick looking ex-military man of the late 21st century now in the garb of ~a private detective of the highest level.~  In the hover car-laden metropolis known as Union City, you are requisitioned by an old friend to repay a favor from your past.  Hugh Martens, now governor of the city, needs you to investigate a series of attacks on the city's industrial centers by what is thought to be a terrorist organization.  The nature of the attacks puts Mr. Martens' political future in the balance, which is one of the main reasons he feels the matter needs some extra attention from him.  Personally, a game in which the motivational center is assisting a politician to keep and advance his career doesn't sound all too exciting, but hey, you can't judge a book by its cover.  We move on.  The investigation begins with our hero being dropped off at the roof auto park of an apartment complex that he has been told to check out.  The environment is actually quite immersive, allowing virtually anything of interest to at least be manipulated, if not used directly for progression into the plot.  Some decent lighting effects and shadows also help bring the scene together, as does the rather fluid animation of the game's main character.  All in all, things look fairly good at the start, but standing around in the parking lot isn't going to help solve any mysteries, so let's get moving.  One thing I'll say for certain is that Team 17 doesn't beat around the bush when it comes to getting you into the style of play that will be necessary to complete Nightlong. As you may have guessed, the adventure consists of Josh going from place to place, picking up various items, and using them in conjunction with one another (or other, non-moveable items on the game screen) in order to advance further into Union City and ultimately bring down the terrorist organization that infects it. We'll use the first puzzle, which is encountered only moments after leaving the auto park, as an example. When you try to leave the roof, you find that the switch used to call the elevator is malfunctioning. Your character, Josh, decides to give it a good swift punch to rectify the problem. Not exactly the patience of a Zen monk, but hey, we all have our vices. Once you look into the mangled switch panel, you'll discover the source of your troubles - a broken fuse.  Josh takes the broken fuse and, after examining the rest of the room, finds nothing that looks like it might help out.  So, it's back out to the parking lot.  As you glide the cursor around the screen, text appears over objects that can be manipulated in some fashion.  This is a good thing too, as it would be virtually impossible to distinguish certain elements of the background from crucial puzzle pieces.  The most important items on the roof are a broken metal railing that will need some attention a bit further into the story, and a piece of aluminum foil that some careless citizen has left on the ground between two hover cars.  Apparently the future is still not without its litterbugs. This particular piece of trash is of some use, so for now we'll forgive the slob who left it there and get on to the solution. With the aluminum foil in our inventory, you right-click on it and then on the busted fuse to combine the two into a fresh, new Macgyver-style fuse. This new creation, when placed back in the switch panel brings the elevator to the roof and sends Josh on his merry way. This is but the first of many similar puzzles that you will be set against, but they get progressively more difficult from here. If you find yourself forgetting this advice, you'll be glad to know that the designers were kind enough to put the solution to this first cranium cracker in the instruction manual.  To be honest though, if you needed help doing this one, you might want to start looking for your receipt....  From a sound standpoint, Nightlong seems to run the wavelength from crest to trough as far as quality is concerned. The music in the futuristic Union City is sadly uninspired, featuring very little to make you sit up in your chair. Personally, I can't recall a single track from memory, and that's usually not a good sign.  Interestingly enough though, the sound effects and voice acting are on par with other games of this type, if not exceding them at several points.  Although it did take me a bit to get used to Josh's voice, and the dubbing needs some work, essentially the package was well presented and told the story well. Even the sound of a pen writing Josh's signature on a pad sounded convincing. It was the small attentions to detail such as this that stand out and allow for the dismissal of the aforementioned flaws.  Perhaps one of the greatest single limitations of this title and those that share in its play format is the relatively low amount of replayability. When going through the first time, solving puzzles, watching the plot unfold, and experiencing the sheer bliss of coming to the realization that you've just figured out what to do after 2 hours of brain-baking torture, the adventure can be quite appealing. Unfortunately, when all is said and done, you are essentially playing the role of a character in a futuristic motion picture. We all know that there are some movies that you can watch over and over again, and they only seem to get better with each viewing. Sadly, Nightlong is not representative of such an event. Completing each puzzle (and ultimately the game) grants more of a feeling of relief than a desire to do it all again.  However, it is a satisfying feeling of relief, and since this trait is shared amongst virtually all graphic adventures, it shouldn't count as much of a factor in this one.  In a nutshell, Team 17 seemed to have been going for a Blade Runner style universe with similar gameplay, just a different plot. When judging against those criteria, I would have to say that Nightlong is a success. However, not every gamer may think so. The fact remains that this type of game is suited to a specific type of adventure player and just can't stack up as well against other adventure games with nearly universal appeal. If you have around 30 to 40 hours of spare time, about 20 bucks, and a hankering for some genuinely challenging puzzle elements, this one might be just what you've been looking to pick up. Otherwise, leave it on the shelf.  -- Rich Rouse", "date": "Nov 5, 1999"}
