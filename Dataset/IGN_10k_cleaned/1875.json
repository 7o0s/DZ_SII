Although this is the first title from TimeGate Studios, the development team is comprised of veterans of such projects as Baldur's Gate, Lords of Chaos and Close Combat. The polish of those games is apparent here and is combined with a really innovative approach to the RTS genre that give us high expectations of TimeGate's future releases. Those of you who are interested in the backstory can find it in the preview. In the meantime, I'm just going to talk about how much fun the game is.  The best thing about the game is the company command system. Rather than relying on individual units, you'll need to group your forces together into effective fighting companies. This means basically that you can field a whole army composed of only a dozen or so groupings. This makes management a helluva lot easier. Beyond that obvious advantage, you can also customize your units. You get the chance to combine four frontline fighters with two different support units and a single commander. You really get a lot of flexibility here.  Let's say you want a fast force. You pick mounted scouts and fill one of the support slots with a ranger and the other with a cleric. The ranger eliminates the movement penalties based on terrain while the cleric can heal the scouts if they get into a fight. Top it all off with an offensive spellcaster for a commander and you've created a really unique unit that is ideally suited for particular purposes. And with like forty different units in the game, the possibilities are practically unlimited. Put a few engineers with your beast riders and you'll have a unit that can take out buildings with ease. A sorceress can freeze enemies in their tracks, keeping them from getting to close to the frontline archers. Like I said, the possibilities are virtually unlimited.  And if any of your units suffers damage or losses due to combat, they can be reconstituted at a nearby city. As long as a unit of yours is standing within the supply radius of one of your cities (or one of your allies' cities), they will slowly regenerate, even replacing slain members -- all except the heroes of course. You begin the game with a single hero, Darius, who's sort of a ~good at everything~ kind of guy. As the game progresses you'll gain heroes with more specific abilities -- like bonuses against certain other unit types, or special protection or combat spells.  The economic model is equally refreshing. Rather than paying flat out resource fees to purchase units and buildings, you instead pay an amount of gold up front. Then the building requires a resource upkeep. You have stone, iron, wood and mana. Each building and unit you have requires a certain amount of upkeep. If you can't meet the upkeep costs, you pay a penalty in gold. If you run out of gold, you're in real trouble.  Instead of building bases, you'll need to gain control of cities, settlements and outposts located across the map. Each city can build a certain number of buildings and each building can support only one of a list of upgrades. This approach not only simplifies the town management aspects of the game, it gives each city a really distinct character. Since building space is limited, you'll need to make some tough choices. If you build a blacksmith you can produce heavy cavalry. But if you build a blacksmith, you may not have enough room to construct a quarry -- which is what you need to build engineers.  The single campaign is extremely fun. Although it runs along a very linear path, you get the feeling that the story and your options are growing with every mission. You start out only having access to Council units, but as the campaign progresses, you gain a varied set of allies. Each ally has a unique set of units (although several are shared -- engineers, settlers, etc.) so you begin to feel like you're playing with several different sides. In addition to the basic Council units, you'll also be able to recruit Beastmen Berserkers or Haroun Windriders.  Kohan offers a lot on the multiplayer side, too. An in game matching service automatically qualifies Kohan for best multiplayer game ever (when will people learn?). Finding games is really easy. Setting them up is a little more difficult, but only because of all the options you're given. You can set specific victory conditions (conquer so many cities, amass so much gold, kick everybody's ass, etc) and even create custom maps. And if you don't have any friends to play with, Kohan offers a pretty flexible custom campaign mode.  Okay, enough raving. The simple truth is that Kohan is a great change of pace not only for the fantasy RTS, but for the strategy genre in general. It really goes to show what a new developer can do in terms of breaking the mold. While Kohan won't be for everyone, anyone's who lamented the ~me too~ mentality that seems to drive the development of strategy games will find something to love in Kohan. Its fresh approach and excellent implementation give us high hopes that TimeGate will continue surprising us with future titles.  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
