Even such sure-fire hit franchises as Road Rash and Nuclear Strike were farmed out to outside companies, most likely out of fear of the N64's considerable cartridge overhead and #2 position in the market. Beetle Adventure Racing is EA's way of saying: ~We haven't forgotten you.~Developed in conjunction with acclaimed Pilotwings 64 developer Paradigm Entertainment, Beetle Adventure Racing takes the exploration and no-holds-barred level design from games like Banjo-Kazooie and mixes everything with the true-life physics and super-fast racing action. Imagine it like being able to jump into your own car and race through Disney World -- without having to pay if anything breaks.Features Fully licensed Volkswagen Beetle ~2.0~ models, ranging from regular street types to lowriders and rally bugs. Six huge tracks, taking more than four minutes to drive from one end to the other. Animated roadside features, such as mills, waterfalls, and even a dragon. Four-point suspension system. Nine multiplayer tracks. Specular highlighting and particle effects. Two-player split-screen race mode. Four-player battle mode. Need for Speed style tachometer.GameplayThe gameplay in Beetle Racing looks pretty straightforward at first. Jump into your Beetle of choice and follow the road and beat out the pack of computer-controlled Beetles to the finishing line. But looks can be deceiving. Every track is loaded with shortcuts, some easy to find others cleverly hidden behind bushes, windows, or walls. Taking these shortcuts and finding nitro boxes for extra speed boosts is a key to beating out the opposition on the higher levels. Imagine the exploration elements of Midway's Rush series coupled with the racing elements of the Top Gear games. But while the competition's titles came up short either in the racing or the exploration department, Beetle Racing seems to have it all.First of all, the handling is divine. In the beginning, you will wonder how to make it around some of the tougher turns without bumping into walls -- then you discover the extremely satisfying powerslides and handbrake turns. Although the game has a ~relaxed~ physics model (like Rush) that allows for high and far jumps, the game's four-point suspension system and the appropriately heavy feel of the cars give it much more authenticity. That's despite the fact that some of the tracks are anything but believable... But more of that later.Beetle Racing's structure mirrors traditional racing games to a certain extent. You select either the Championship (one player only) or the Single mode (up to two players) and start to race. The Championship mode enables players to take on a pack of seven other beetles and race for the cup. As you progress through the seasons, you unlock new tracks as well as new beetles. The Single Mode, on the other hand, is divided into three different modes: Full Grid, Duel, and Time Attack.Although it doesn't have the cops and robbers theme, Beetle Racing can't deny its Need for Speed roots. Apart from visual similarities (and the hidden Police Beetle), this game is just as fast, if not faster than EA's NfS titles. But as good as the speed and handling are in BAR, they're not the real stars of the game. More than any other racer out there, Beetle Adventure Racing will definitely be remembered for track design.There are six racing tracks, all of which are highly detailed and beautiful to look at. We would have loved to see a few more courses, but considering the size and detail of the ones that are in the game, it's a wonder there are even this many. Here's a track list to give you some ideas of what to expect: Coventry Cave: This European looking stage lets you tear up the British countryside. Smash through haystacks and barns, drive past an old mill, giant waterfalls, mineshafts and even Stonehenge. Key points include a shortcut through a tunnel, a castle ruin and a glass window. Mount Mayhem: Imagine this one like the snow level of every major platform game. A tall mountain covered with snow and fog and plenty of hazardous drops and icy caves. Some of the highpoints of this track involve a ski slope, a crystal cave and a UFO. Inferno Isle: A dense jungle surrounded by a tall, electrical fence. If you've seen Spielberg's movie, you know what oversized lizard is being contained within. The designers also threw in a whole village, a seaside town and even an active volcano. Keep an eye out for a little hut in the burning village. Sunset Sands: The dunes of this Egyptian inspired stage deliver some cool jumps. Crash into a pyramid and drive through its mysterious tunnels and caves. Use your rearview mirror to find some shortcuts you may otherwise miss. Metro Madness: The game's largest level plays more like Blast Corps than a racing game. You can smash through several buildings y and drive through hallways inside. One of the highpoints of the track is a short race against a train. Wicked Woods: Looks like you took a wrong turn somewhere in Transylvania. After a long scary drive through a dark forest, you jump right into the first ~serious~ haunted house in a racing game. Try to jump throughIt's hard to sum up Adventure Racing's tracks in only a few sentences as they are absolutely, positively the most detailed tracks in a racing game. To call the hundreds of routes through the stages ~shortcuts~ would be an injustice. You will literally find new areas in the stages every time you play. Sometimes you come upon them by chance. For example, you don't have enough speed to make the jump over a chasm; Instead of plunging to your death, you start to fall and smash right through a rock wall into a new cave you've never even seen.The island level alone has two fully realized villages, a tropical jungle, and even a coastal region where a pirate ship is attacking a fortress. Not convinced? Wait till you drive through the haunted forest with its foreboding full moon looming in the cloudy sky. After you jump through the stained glass window of an old church and make your way into the dank caves of a fantasy mountain, you will see something like a giant red worm moving around on top of millions of gold doubloons. Had you taken a different route, you would have seen that this truck-sized worm is only the tail of a ferocious dragon guarding its hort.On the downside, one of the game's strongest salespoints is also its Achilles Heel. Make no mistake about it -- the Beetles are cool and deliver all the speed and handling you'd want, but what if EA had gone for a multi-car-license as with Need for Speed? We can only imagine how cool it would have been to compete for a Lotus or a Ferrari instead of another VW Bug. At the very least, EA could have included the classic Beetle model or a few other VW cars. The relatively limited number of tracks and cars is actually our only serious complaint. Luckily, EA and Paradigm came up with a great idea to lengthen the game's replay value.Each track features a total of 100 bonus points, divided into bonus boxes of differing value, and special ~flower boxes.~ After gamers have unlocked all cars and tracks and are looking for more, trying to find the hidden flower boxes that unlock game cheats and special features adds a new level, just like the keys in the Rush series. The bonus points, which have to be found during the Championship races, open up six hidden battle stages.Beetle BattleSure, the two-player racing mode is a cool feature, but unlike most other racing games, Beetle Racing doesn't stop here. Paradigm and EA took the time to come up with this interesting vehicle-based capture-the-flag mode called ~Beetle Battle.~ Up to four-players select a beetle (regular version only) and jump into nine different arenas, exclusively designed for the Battle Mode. Rather than racing, the objective is to find differently colored bug icons that are hidden throughout the levels. The catch, you need one of each color to win. The bigger catch, the icons are constantly changing color. Naturally, you have to prevent your opponents from collecting the icons before you, so you can pick up a number of different offensive and defensive power-ups: Mines: These are disguised as pick-ups and damage any beetle trying to pick them up. Including you. Mystery: This item will screw your opponents by either turning their screens upside down, distorting it, or by making their view really foggy. Rockets: Self-explanatory, but still very painful. Stealer: This magnet lets you snatch another beetle's pick-ups. Health/Poison: This item circles between health and poison. Time it right. Invincibility: Turns your beetle chrome and invincible. Smash your opponents.Once all the lady bug icons are obtained, racers will attempt to find the level exit while fending off opponents who use their pick-ups to steal their icons. There is nothing more infuriating than getting blasted by a missile as you are about to get to the exit -- or more satisfying, if you're the one firing the missile. Beetle Battle may lack the options of other ~deathmatch~ levels and it tends to be a bit long when playing with two players only, but it certainly delivers hours and hours of fun. Great fun.GraphicsIf you thought Pilot Wings 64 and F-1 World Grand Prix sported impressive visuals, you will love Paradigm's second generation graphics engine. The amount of track detail and the texture diversity is simply unmatched. On top of an excellent physics engine with decent (but not perfect) framerates, the game has all the graphical bells and whistles you would expect. Snowflakes fall to the ground, objects shatter into hundreds of pieces, the cars leave 1080-style tracks in the snow or even a realistic looking wake when driving through shallow water.Paradigm didn't cut any corners in the effects department. Sparks fly when you hit walls, the dragon blows fire into your face and more. In fact, the only disappointment is when your car plunges into a pond as it only produces that small Pilotwingsey splash. C'mon, Beetles float, as any Herbie fan will know. The best effect, on the other hand, is the reflection mapping. Yep, you heard right. Drive by a sign and it will actually reflect in your cars paint. It's an awesome trick (it's actually the full screen view mapped onto the car, much like the jumbotrons in many of the second generation sports games) that's sure to be copied by many upcoming racers.SoundThe sound effects are excellent all around. Unlike in most other racing games, BAR's vehicles all sound differently. Skidding on a street will sound different from skidding on sand, your opponents will honk at you when you get too close, your Beetle creaks when it lands and so on. Unfortunately, the music is limited to generic ~drum and bass~ tracks. It's not that it's bad, it just doesn't fit most of the tracks and there is hardly any bass to be heard... It would have been cool if EA could have gotten the licenses to some of the tunes played in the Beetle commercials, like Fluke's ~Absurd~ or Trio's ~Da Da Da~ -- but that may be asking a little too much.Peripheral SupportBoth Rumble Pak and Controller Pak are supported. The rumble works out great and BAR only uses 4 pages on your memory pak. No dedicated steering wheel support (c'mon folks, give us analog pedal control in your next game), but it still plays rather well with a wheel.Aside from Wave Race, this is definitely the best racer on N64 yet. I love this game -- and I have yet to meet anyone who didn't enjoy taking BAR's Bugs for a spin. Beetle Adventure Racing arrives as a breath of fresh air in a genre that hasn't moved forward in years. The tracks are unbelievable, physics are cool and the handling is dead-on. While other racers have problems maintaining a decent framerate while throwing a simple oval track with a few mountains in the background at you, BAR pulls it off with temples, helicopters, waterfalls, ghosts, dragons, and the ability to go anywhere, anytime. Even if you're not into racers, the multiplayer action and the thrill of exploration will grab you instantly. My top pick for Spring '99.", "date": "Mar 25, 1999"}
