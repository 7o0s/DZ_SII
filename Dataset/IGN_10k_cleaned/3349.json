You see, I have a soft spot for the little fellas. When I was a young lad my precious pet rodent Pumpkin was mauled to death by a 75 pound golden retriever who, following the travesty, I dubbed Satan. And so, it's not hard to imagine the pain and frustration I've had to endure the past few years while smiting, shooting, whacking and cursing my way through hordes of those fuzzy little runts in the early levels of nearly every MMORPG for the sake of earning a few extra experience points.    So when CDV and Reakktor announced Neocron, a first-person shooter MMORPG hybrid set in a dense, futuristic cyberpunk atmosphere (a single city to be exact), I rejoiced and celebrated the end of my hedonistic, rat killing ways. As an apprentice ~runner,~ carrying out deeds for one of nearly a dozen political factions competing for control over the post apocalyptic city, I would have undoubtedly have bigger fish to fry. So when I signed in, logged on to CityCom (the city's versatile intranet) and researched potential missions, I was infinitely disappointed to find a request entitled ~URGENT:  Runner needed to alleviate sewer rat problem.~  That's Neocron in a nutshell. Promising idea, lackluster execution. Different from the rest, but not really -- an enjoyable gaming experience, but nothing compared to what it coulda, woulda, shoulda been. On paper, it's three parts Blade Runner, two parts William Gibson novel, a pinch of The Matrix and a scoop of Deus Ex to boot. Compelling atmosphere, endless possibilities. Unfortunately, the game has a few shortcomings that keep it far from fulfilling its tremendous potential.  Upon first glance, Neocron is graphically on par with the competition.  Character models are sharp and detailed, the architecture is impressive, and animations are smooth. However, after only a few minutes of gameplay, one starts to notice that the game suffers from a lack of variation.  For instance, the strict visual limitations in the character creation process (you can choose from about a dozen different outfits and faces) result in a bland undifferentiated population. And while you can purchase different outfits or don distinctive armor, it's a real let down to see such an interesting atmosphere full of uninteresting looking people.    This limitation extends to the environment itself as well. Neocron takes place in a 28th century based city of the same name with a rich history and detailed political climate. Couple this with the game's primary influences (Blade Runner, Dark City, Gattaca, Deus Ex, etc.), and one would expect a lush sprawl of neon lights, off-beat shops and chaotic activity. Unfortunately, the city of Neocron is an uninspired collaboration of cluttered corridor streets and cookie cutter stores. In fact, the city's three main boroughs (the Plaza, Via Rosso, and Pepper Park), each with its own distinctive history and inhabitants, are primarily differentiated merely through different colored neon lights. The game does make up for its visual shortcomings with a solid ambient soundtrack and an omniscient voice announcing various happenings around the city, such as warnings about dangerous criminals and political ads.  Neocron makes its largest leap from the MMORPG pack not in its atmosphere or setting, but rather in its fusion of traditional roleplaying elements with first-person shooter gameplay. And while the game does pack in more action than your average massive multiplayer game, it also includes a surprising amount of depth and detail. As mentioned earlier, character creation is somewhat limited, incorporating few appearances, four main ~races~ (Private Eye, Spy, GenTank and PsiMonk), and a limited number of professions (which merely adjust your skill distributions). However, Neocron does excel in its vast political climate. The city is composed of about a dozen warring factions from the big brother like City Administration to the Tsunami Syndicate, an underground drug cartel and crime syndicate that isn't afraid to advertise its activities. After choosing a side, the player is assigned their own personal apartment, a handful of survival goodies and easy access to CityCom, a computer terminal from which one can access local news, player and clan information, and the mission bank.  As mentioned earlier, the first missions are unoriginal and monotonous. You'll be requested to perform tasks such as delivering important packages, cleaning the city of pesky vermin and researching blueprints in order to gain allegiance with your faction and earn a few credits. The boredom is somewhat softened by the Nav-Ray system (a series of arrows and holographic lines that will guide you to your requested destination) and the incorporation of Neocron's biggest selling point, action-based combat.  The tedium (and emotional exhaustion - sigh) of scouring the city's underground sewage system for roaches, rodents and mutants to axe is softened by standard, first-person, point and click combat. Nothing special here, just select your weapon, put the cursor over your intended target, and press the hell out of the mouse button. Don't get too excited though, Neocron's action shares more in common with the slow-paced tempo of Deus Ex (sans the whole open-ended, free form gameplay that made it so brilliant) than other popular button mashing titles such as Unreal Tournament or Quake III. Just imagine Anarchy Online, but rather than targeting an opponent and pressing attack, you get to manually shoot on command. Revolutionary? Hardly. But a welcomed change from the whole ~A~ key MMORPG trend.  Despite the new combat system, low level progression is still as dull as bricks. However, once gamers get over that initial hump, they are treated to new gameplay elements such as combat in the wastelands (an outer city hellhole), PvP combat (or not, depending on whether you want to remove your protective Law Enforcement implant) and clan-based missions. Whether this is enough to suffice the ravenous appetites of the hardcore MMORPG crowd is tough to tell. And although CDV claims that the city of Neocron's fate is in the hands of the players themselves, there is little evidence to support that one's actions carry any weight.  What did you think of Neocron?  However, before CDV can incorporate this facet into Neocron, it has to worry about tending to some hindering bugs and gameplay imbalances. For the most part, Neocron runs smoothly with few instances of lag, but suffers from a steep economy, NPC's that float in the air (preventing characters from entering certain rooms), and freeze-ups. I can't express the frustration I endured when I was booted from the game while trying to enter one of the game's red light strip clubs (which are hardly as noteworthy as we initially anticipated).  Despite minor issues, Neocron did manage an impressive launch and is showing signs of improvement with each and every pass. Is it enough to warrant hordes of gamers dropping their alternate lives in established titles such as Everquest or Anarchy Online?  No.  However, it may gain a nice cult following from those looking for a change of pace in atmosphere and gameplay from their current multiplayer playlists.", "date": "Dec 20, 2002"}
