I really liked the first two games. I liked pretty much everything about them even though they were a bit frustrating every now and then. Earthworm Jim had freshness and appeal to the weirdo in all of us that you just couldn't find in most games. Mix that with some great sound and graphics (for the time at least) and you had a winning combination that would keep the cows coming back for more and more.  Unfortunately, the when Jim transferred to 3D he forgot to pack the fun and playability in his suitcase for the trip. For the most part, the game really does make an effort to keep the style of strange humor in the first two games. But what Shiny made funny and entertaining in 2D, Vis just couldn't transfer over into this new format with the same level of success.  Why? That's a damn good question as the game is just as strange as its predecessors. Somehow I think that the development team got so wrapped up in the transition to 3D that they forgot the essence of the Earthworm. Instead of totally different random levels where you are required to make sure a little puppy that mutates into a beast and mauls you doesn't fall into a pit, or fly a balloon across the sky while being shot at, or any of the other crazy inventions of the first games, we are left with slightly creative levels that only give us the standard Mario platform experience. Maybe I was just expecting too much from this game in terms of weirdness and level originality, but there are more reasons for its downfall.  So the story goes that Jim has been smooshed by a cow and has consequently lost his marbles. In order to find his marbles, he must run through the different parts of his psyche, such as his happiness and fear, and find all of his marbles. Each of the levels has something strange going on in it -- like a chicken coop war for instance. There are several cow udders that you will also need to find in order to open new parts of Jim's subconscious. Completing tasks in each of the levels allows you to collect these. Strangely enough, all of this gives the game a continuous theme (as opposed to a random splattering of weird levels that seem to have nothing to do with anything), which is a new approach (and one that might have ruined the game). Along the way you'll fight disco zombies, militant cows, and robots as well as some of your favorite fiends such as Professor Monkey for a Head and Bob the Goldfish.  First off, this game is a port from the Nintendo 64, which we all know is just not as graphically robust as a PC can be. And while they have spruced up the graphics a tad by allowing for higher resolutions, the polygon count is the same. If you bring a game that runs on the N64's processor to the PC, you have got to spend a bit more time upgrading the graphics. If you don't want to, then don't port it. This isn't to say that it looks incredibly ugly or anything. It does have some bright cartoony colors and some decent textures.   Now the camera is a whole different matter. It just isn't good. The camera has trouble following Jim around the world in a helpful manner and at times really can cause some major problems for you, especially when playing the boss levels. There are controls that allow you to rotate the camera, but they are sluggish and mostly don't help too much when you're in a pinch.  Aside from the camera issues, the gameplay itself isn't terrible (with a couple of exceptions) but really isn't all that fun either. As I mentioned before, the levels are mainly jumping around in a chunky 3D platformy world shooting things and collecting Jim's lost marbles. It's pretty easy for the most part and won't really require you to exert yourself too much. The boss levels on the other hand are almost ridiculous. You are charged to ride around on the belly of a floating pig, which is a really strange idea that I like, and collect all 100 blue marbles in the level.  The trick is that the boss is collecting the marbles as well. So in order to collect the marbles, you need to steer a pig around that is exceedingly difficult to control, collect bullets to shoot at the boss, shoot bullets at the boss and collect the marbles that fall out of it's pockets, and try not to get shot yourself. If you do get shot, not only do you drop a bunch of marbles, but you also loose a bit of life. Once you lose your life then you have to start the whole thing over. Steve played it a little just to see if I was totally uncoordinated or something, but he had just as many problems as I did. Frustrating? Yes. Fun? No.  The sound is also another matter of content Jim 3D's developers. Now the first two had some musical scores that were rather strange but very satisfying. One level in particular I remember is a level that required Jim to swim through a level in the costume of a newt with Moonlight Sonata as the level music. It was great to hear the soothing and relaxing music as you floated through the level. And it really fit in with the rapid machinegun laser fire that you would burst out at enemies every now and again. This game doesn't have that. The music didn't catch my attention, and the rapid machinegun laser fire just is nowhere near as satisfying this time around. Earthworm Jim 3D really has nothing special to it when it comes to sound.  When it comes down to it, this game is just a really average attempt at a platform game that should never have been ported to the PC. Everything in this game seems splashed together in an attempt to get back the insanity of the other games, which is really funny considering Jim is trying to get back his sanity, but it just didn't let itself fall into the true depths of Jim's insanity. But at least you get to decapitate some cows. Groovy.  -- Dan Adams", "date": "Jun 15, 2000"}
