There are a lot of creative people out there who would like to express themselves in games, but don't have the technical know-how (or gigantic budget) to do it. I'm one of those people. In fact, you could go so far as to say I love creating things in games. I've been a creative person my entire life -- for which this job occasionally awards an opportunity -- and love it when I can express that. The great part is that tools for this kind of creativity are getting better. Look at titles like The Sims, RollerCoaster Tycoon, and the upcoming Spore for examples. Peter Molyneux and his development team at Lionhead obviously like a lot of the same things and can see the profit in them. Thus they started development on The Movies, a game that they hoped would be the next huge seller across the world. Not surprisingly, that game has a lot of the elements that made both The Sims and RollerCoaster Tycoon so successful. While some of these elements haven't turned out to be the most efficient (or fun, really), the core ideas are unique and create an experience much different than your average title. For players that appreciate different aspects of tycoon and creative gaming, The Movies is going to be hard to beat this holiday season.   At first glance, The Movies is a simple tycoon game that starts you off with next to nothing aside from an empty lot in Hollywood in the 1920s. From there, you'll have to hire staff, construct buildings, and hire stars to direct and act in films all the way up through the present. You'll face rudimentary money management and plenty of planning as far as placing buildings in your lot. But hiding underneath this well-groomed exterior is a pretty powerful system for creating some fairly complex movies.  The films use canned animations on a variety of sets with plenty of extra props to add flair. This certainly has limitations, but Lionhead has done a pretty commendable job creating a system that's pretty easy to figure out, even if it takes an anal nature to get things perfect. But I'll get into that more in a bit.     The Movies offers different ways to play which will appeal to various types of gamers, but playing the main campaign game will unlock all of the extra sets, props, and technologies. Once unlocked, each item can be used in sandbox mode as well, which offers the same tycoon style play, but with extra options to keep the difficulty down. There'll probably be cheats that will unlock most of these features at some point without having to play the campaign, but barring that occurrence, you'll actually need to play through the various decades  of technological knowledge to unlock secrets of good cinema.    How you play through the campaign is really up to you considering it's nearly impossible to actually lose, though it's not guaranteed that you'll actually win. You'll have a huge sum of money to play with and can basically move at your own pace, meaning you can have a huge stable of actors or simply a few that you really take care of (which is much more relaxing). The trick is not to care that your studio isn't at the top of the charts. Once you start caring, and you begin hiring more stars to pump out more movies, the game overwhelms with a swell of micromanagement that erodes some of the fun.   It's not really the core ideas that create problems (in fact the core ideas are where the game succeeds) -- it's the artificial limitations that Lionhead has imposed. The biggest of these impediments is on the number of employees that you can hire. While you really wouldn't want to hire more than 12 stars (they're a huge pain in the ass to manage), you do want to hire more maintenance workers, janitors, entourage, extras, script writers, scientists, and crew members to do the dirty work in your studio. The limit simply places an unwanted focus on employee management. So, when your studio gets big enough and your stars are demanding an entourage (which must be taken from available employees) the studio suffers. Buildings begin to degrade for the lack of maintenance workers, movies might not have enough extras or crew, and trash doesn't get picked up efficiently. It just doesn't make sense when there should be an unlimited supply of potential employees.    Compounding the issue is the inability to set zones of coverage for workers so they don't run from one side of the lot to the other to try to fix or clean things while an employee on the other side does the same. Eventually I was forced to start picking workers up and placing them on any set about to be used to make sure it was in top shape before shooting because set repair affects the movie rating. It's just not fun.   Of course, your biggest and most important employees are your stars. They're the ones that direct and act in the movies and will therefore play the largest role in the success of any movies released. They have all the needs of the privileged and will complain when worked too much or not pampered enough. They'll need to be up on their fashion, in the public eye, and happy as can be in order to get the best performance possible. This game inside the game means you'll have to plan how you use your stars and how you care for them, which can be fun when there are only a few of them.   Unfortunately, with too many, keeping stars happy becomes more of a chore than an interesting balance of responsibility. Even the calmest star will become stressed after working for a while and it seems that only eating or drinking can really relieve the stress efficiently. Once you have a full stable of stars, the game devolves into playing dress-up, putting them in either a restaurant or bar in between jobs, and improving their trailers. And while some of the animations show good personality, it's difficult to keep up with needs, leaving little time to watch the fun. You could potentially just let things happen and watch the show once again if you don't care about stars or studio rating. Not having to worry about losing definitely makes a difference to making the game fun, though anyone that hates being number two on the charts (like me) will quickly have problems with that philosophy.     Another difficult aspect of the game is star relationships, which don't build up like they should. After nearly 20 hours of playing the tycoon portion of The Movies, I have yet to have any relationships increase over the acquaintance level. As far as I can tell, the only thing you can do to increase early relationships is place stars next to each other to have a chat, which is not fun to do over and over again. Place them in a bar together and they'll be uncomfortable in such an intimate setting. Isn't a bar a place people go to meet people? Since when do you get uncomfortable having a drink with another person? That's the whole point! Why can't you have them play basketball together, work out together, or some other activity at least? I think they gain relationship when you have stars practice or perform in movies together, but it's negligible if it does.   Managing all of this stuff should be helped by an intelligent interface much like the one found in Black & White 2. But in The Movies the interface can just get in the way of what you're doing, with so many bubbles popping up around the screen (even when you don't want them), and it doesn't provide as many shortcuts as I would have liked. It's nice that you can pick up anyone in the studio no matter where you are, but then you'll need to move the camera to find the right building in order to drop them there, which can be annoying. It seems Lionhead could have solved this by creating a right click command interface that orders people to go certain places. For instance, being able to right click on a star and choose Go To - Makeover - Manual would have been nice rather than dragging and dropping.   It's a little sad that the game bogs down because of the employees as there's a lot to like underneath. The level of detail in sets and buildings is pretty incredible. Creating a wonderful studio is fun provided that you plan it out correctly. You'll have to choose between which sets you want in your lot and plan how much decoration they receive. By the end, my lot devolved to an unorganized mess because I liked having lots of different sets to make things interesting and many of the sets have gigantic or oddly shaped footprints. Planning a studio layout can also be pretty important to gameplay as you'll want sets, trailers, bars, and restaurants to be in the same vicinity to cut down on travel time.    Potential players should note that sandbox mode does give the option to have buildings instantly constructed, to turn building decay off, keep stars from misbehaving, set as much money as they want, and even start with a ready-built lot. Just remember that in order to get all the technology, you'll have to research it first if you haven't already, even if you select to start your game in the year 2000.    But all of this is just the face to what many people will consider the real meat of the game: the movie maker. Once all of the sets, props, costumes, and technology have been unlocked, there are unlimited possibilities for how many different movies you can make. It's really just a matter of how much time you're willing to put into the process. You can't do everything you'd want to do, but what's there is about as good as can be. Movies are made with a variety of scenes using canned animation, so creative gamers will have to figure out a way to work around that to create their scenes. But each scene can be changed using different lighting, weather, props, set dressings, backdrops, and costumes. Different camera techniques like cameras on tracks or cranes to go along with sliders affect how violent fights are, the different moods of scenes. With dozens of different sets, it's hard not not to have fun and  come up with something good if you're willing to put in the time.     And that's the kicker: this isn't really for the timid. While the interface is easy enough to understand and manipulate, getting things to work properly can be pretty tough. Scenes might not always be exactly what you want, or they won't match up well together because of those great canned animations. While there's a search function to help narrow down which scene you're looking for, you'll still spend a lot of time actually watching all of the scenes (of which there are a ton) in order to pick the one you really want.    After you ~write~ a script by placing props, scenes and actors together, you can shoot the film in the studio. During the campaign, you will have to wait until the movie has actually been produced, though you can watch the movie being made on the various sets across the studio. It's definitely fun to watch everything happen, but if you're just in it to make the movies, it can take a while. Thankfully, in sandbox mode you can have movies made instantly so you can make your sandbox game into a movie making machine. I find it strange that there isn't a custom scripting feature outside of the campaign or sandbox mode, but that's a very minor issue.   When a movie has been ~filmed~ by the cast and crew (or instantly finished by the game) the really funny parts come with the post production work. This is where you can add anything from fade ins and outs to voice-overs and subtitles. You can even add lip synching, with your own audio, for any character. Post-production is very easy to use, it will help to add a lot of personality and fun to your movies.   The Movies is founded on some terrific ideas. Lionhead could very well have struck gold with this title considering the level of creativity for players (as well as whole families) and the amount of detail involved. The movie-making tools themselves are enough to recommend the game to creative players, but those looking for a hard-core tycoon game should probably look elsewhere. While the studio lots themselves can become wonderful places given the right attention, and stars can be fun to screw with, too many limitations and confusion as to why some things work the way they do can create a tiresome management simulation. If you don't need it to be a great management game, The Movies is worth your time for its creativity and the sheer fun of making movies.", "date": "Nov 9, 2005"}
