As it's transformed over the years, from the great, bare-bones ISS to the disappointing ESPN MLS Extra Time (here in the US) to the brilliant Winning Eleven 8, Konami's series has brought the most realistic, deep and strategic soccer game to a home system, full stop. EA might have the licenses, but it still doesn't come close in gameplay.   This year proves to be a different one for Konami. Developer Konami TYO was always old-fashioned in presentation, yet the strength of its gameplay and graphics always won out. The endless layers of tactical play, smart AI and the unbeatable one-on-one matches outweighed the clunky menu systems and lack of official teams or players.   Alongside the top-notch gameplay highlighted in this year's superb Master League is a slew of improvements -- from the acquisition of official big-league licenses to a more operational front-end, to on-screen referees to the improved Training mode. This year, Winning Eleven 8 offers even deeper core gameplay, while broadening in scope, giving long-time fans the names, official leagues, the feature sets, and moves they've been clamoring for.   Core Gameplay  The Winning Eleven series' consistent accomplishment over the years has been the developer's ability to pay attention to the nature of the sport and deliver the game in its purest form. Whether you're a Brit in Bristol watching league play or a Yank in New York viewing Major League Soccer, Konami has masterfully incorporated realism and skill into its series like none other. This year's effort once again focuses on improving AI, adding and refining control and technique, and bettering all the little things, from free kicks and throw-ins to penalty kicks.   Even though I've been playing it for years, TYO's series continues to stun me with its incredible depth and variety. We're not talking about rocket science here, but somehow this soccer game feels simultaneously like high-tech science and masterful art. It's like every time I'm ready to evolve as a player, the game has more for me. Improving upon last year's well-polished title, WE8 adds in new moves, dribbling skills and techniques that, when used with proper timing and skill, will elate you and surprise your opponent. Old-time give-and-goes still function perfectly, varying pressure on the analog sticks initiates off-speed dribbles, and a full 360 spin on the right analog actuates the fancy Marseille Roulette, among other moves.   Goalies are more versatile than ever. Though I feel confident I can beat any of my American friends here at IGN, I still check out the Training Mode every season. This year's version is far more fleshed out, far more navigable than in previous games, giving seasoned players ideas for new moves to incorporate into play, but more importantly it offers new players a place to learn the ins and outs of soccer. Which, like any sport, can be complicated and confusing.   The replay function is sweet indeed. You can learn individual dribbles, a smattering of passes, shots, defensive techniques, advancing methods, and for your goalie, infinitely useful moves while in the box. The only minor quibbles I'll offer is that I wish there were ever more techniques offered, and the symbols used to indicate particular buttons are so small they're hard to read (and I have 20-20 vision and a large TV screen). In all, the training mode is deep, well organized, and well thought out.   Player speed has been once again improved, and so has versatility in player movement and athleticism. The first time you boot up the game you'll stand back in on awe as players run through amazing animations which seamlessly blend into one another. Last year's animations have been honed to an even higher level of precision in this version, while new animations appear again and again in little amazing situations. Whether it's an opponent shoving you out of the referee's sight, your midfielder schooling the opposition with off-speed dribbles, or players simply vying for control of the ball in a heated dash, the minutia of the sport is captured with delicacy, precision, and beauty.      On the one hand, the animation is amazing. On the other, it can also get in the way, delaying your reaction for just a split second, or continuing on while you're trying to pull off another one. This varies a tiny bit between the systems: The Xbox is a tiny bit faster, while the PS2 version is just a split-second slower in response time. It's almost unnoticeable. This is also the game's first appearance on Xbox, and the controls work well. It was easy to make the transition from the PS2's shoulder buttons to the Xbox's triggers, though I know many players will prefer to stick with the controls they know and love on the PS2.   Another impressive attribute of WE8's is how it enables you play the game in any style you want, and always with different outcomes. Each time I play through a career in the Master League, I'm impressed with how the different teams play. Some will attack you with speedier, more dribble-happy players, striking early and aggressively, while others sit back and adjust to your strategy. You can approach the game with long lob passes and crosses, or you can dive into controlling each strike with precise dribbles, moves, and through-passes. Controlling the goalie is even better than before, too, with more moves and subtle abilities.    I'm always surprised at how wild each game's outcome is too. Since soccer is always a low-scoring game, every minute accumulates into an incredibly passionate potential explosion. Basically, each goal is a potential soccer orgasm. You're sitting there biting your nails, and then wham! You finally penetrate the opponent defenses. Once, in a nil-nil game, the opposing goalie rolled the ball out to his center defender. My center forward was close by and I rushed him, stole the ball, and strode in for a perfect strike. I had never done that before. This is just once instance among hundreds that will surprise and delight you about the game.    Opponent AI has broadened out, too. Opposing AI is more skilled in deep corner conversions, it's better at attacking loose random balls, heads the ball better to opponents, and constantly uses positioning and formation to thwart your defenses.   Master League and More  With its multiple modes of play, soccer fans can dig deep into the single-player modes with verve. The game offers the standard suite of modes: Training, Match, Master League, League, and Cup. Unfortunately, the North American version does not offer online play; this isn't the end of the world, and I'd rather have a good, complete online experience than a bare-bones, slapped-together one, but it's really past time for this game to get online. Instead, Konami has stuck with one to two-player options. (For those who love to play games with keyboards, the PC version offers LAN play.)   Watch the excellent AI thwart your attempts to score. Players who've ground their teeth on previous versions will be happy to see the Edit Mode back, so they can create the teams and players from leagues not included in this year's edition. But if you follow the Italian, Spanish or Dutch leagues, you're in luck since Konami finally secured the official rights to these leagues players, teams, kits, and more, increasing the game's realism and authenticity.    Graphics to die for. Following this year's enhanced Training mode, Match offers players the ability to vie in an exhibition match or penalty shootout. Master League is the game's heart and soul. It offers a full season, complete with a healthy management system offering players the ability to tweak finances and team formation with greater ease, trade and acquire players, and, in a beautiful touch, the ability to train players, with improved stat pages to back them up. After each game, a tracking page displays the improvement each player has made in an impressive laundry list of attributes. What's cool, too, is that each player will improve in the areas you've used him most effectively in, whether its responsiveness, passing, defense, tackles, dribbling, or shooting.    After each match a helpful Topics page appears. It offers players a simple way to quickly manage their team, to see the opposition's strategy, its roster, and to adjust their team accordingly. The Topics page lists financial problems, retirements, players leaving and returning, ranking announcements, condition warnings, and more, making it quicker to address any aspect of management. Like everything Konami TYO has done in this year's iteration, it's honed previous functions, while adding new depth and versatility to the Master League's already stunning depth. The other modes include League (great for a multi-player round robin bout) and Cup (a 32-nation international cup in a traditional cup or a Konami Cup, in which you set the format).      This year's feature set is sweet. Along with new dribbling moves and animations, the free kicks and penalty kicks are slightly different than last year, offering more efficient and streamline techniques to strike. Overall, there are more stats to track your game in any mode, and the on-screen referee, while not actually affecting the core gameplay any, does add another layer of realism and completeness. You'll be able to play as one of 136 club teams, 57 national teams, and more than 4,500 international soccer players. And last but not least, the WE-Shop from last year gives players even more chances to earn cash to bolster their Master League teams with tons of mini-games and challenges.    Graphics  The first things you'll notice about WE8 is the clean motion of each player and the subtle seamless animations that underscore the game's continued brilliance. Each player moves with tons of motion captured moves, so that when they're simply walking from the locker rooms to the field, blinking, high-fiving each other, complaining to the ref, or kneeling in prayer after a goal, they look and move with stunning realism.   This year's added animations and honed previous animations push the game to a new level of graphic superiority. You can see the animations and movement at work in the wide camera mode, but by zooming in using any one of the eight-plus camera angles, you'll witness incredible textural work and character modeling too.    The fields are numerous and varied. Throughout a season, you'll encounter a handful of rainy matches, some with light, almost unnoticeable effect on the field, and others with heavier, sloggier conditions. The fans all look relatively good, though the crowds still look like simple animated cardboard cutouts repeatedly cycling through all of two frames of animation.    The replay camera is awesome. You have total control over every split-second of action, from changing the camera angle to slowing the action down entirely to zooming in or out of the situation. You can also save replays.   Great facial texture work. Sound  I'd say that if there was any area in need of repair or improvement in this year's version, it would have to be the sound. The standard generic guitar rock with synth keyboards that cheese out the middle of each theme song is hard on this journalist's ears. But it should also be hard on Konami's pride. There are so many ways to go now with music, be it licensed, original, heck, even techno or classical, but this music doesn't seem to really satisfy anybody. Its' not terrible butwait, that's a lie, it's awful. The crowd sounds, chants, screams and yells, however, are awesome. They create a fantastic aural atmosphere that charges each stadium differently in each game.    Nothing but love. After years of hearing Peter Brackley and Trevor Brooking commentate with their superb accents and official sounding comments, I've come to realize this year that the commentating in WE8 is weak. It's been weak for some time, actually. Brackley and Brooking have nothing substantive to say about the actual players' actions or the momentum of the game, and they certainly have no pertinent comments on goals, passes, or distinct events. Once, when asked what he thought of the first half, Trevor Brooking said at half-time, ~I think it was a great game, well worth watching.~ This struck me as odd because the game wasn't over, it was only half time. It's high time this aspect of Konami's game gets some attention.Konami's Winning Eleven series is a remarkable sports game. Year in and out the actual core gameplay, which has always been superb, inches along with new refinements, layers of play, and increased depth. This year's effort is no different than most for Konami in that Winning Eleven 8 offers the most realistic and mind-numbingly fun game of soccer on a videogame system. While the core has improved and changed, the surface has too. The game's graphics on both the Xbox and PS2, are excellent. Great attention to detail was paid in motion capture, animation, character models, and textural work, especially on player faces. It's disappointing the game isn't online, but it's not a deal breaker by any means. Winning Eleven 8's single-player Master League is enormously good fun, and with its expanded management tools and WE-Shop minigames, the game is easily worth $50. The one-on-one gameplay? Priceless. If you want to get in a serious grudge match with a friend, you have to play this game.", "date": "Feb 1, 2005"}
