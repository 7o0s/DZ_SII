Last year it featured a focus on the PGA mode, which the consoles lacked. Likewise, the gameplay mechanics have always differed. But this year its similarity to the console version is as close as it has ever been. It has many of the same features, the same courses and players. However, the presentation and controls make it feel like a completely different game.   Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 on PC is designed for the golf crowd that wants to feel the same way they do on fairways in real life; and, if you play like any of the IGN editors, this could be defined as frustrated and horrified. Of course, this gives you a great reason to seek out Tiger Woods 2004, where you have a much better shot at displaying any skill.   The Facts  Return of the mouse-controlled TrueSwing technology -- three-click is available, but not default  Create yourself with the detailed Game Face mode  Totally revamped World Tour mode sends you around the globe to compete for big earnings  Tournament Mode: a series of multi-round competitions against the PGA pros  Now includes a full-fledged Pro Shop with over a thousand items for sale  Get sponsored to earn gear and cash from big names like Callaway, Nike, and Ping  Brand-new play types including Battle Golf, Long Drive Shootout, Best Ball, Stableford, and Alternate Shot  New announcing team: Feherty returns, but Gary McCord provides new narration  Online play for tournaments and peer-to-peer play  Create your own course with the built-in architectGameplay  EA has used the last year of development time wisely. Since Tiger 2003 had set the foundation for basic gameplay firmly in place, the team took the opportunity to flesh out this year's features. There are, of course, new courses; Bethpage Black, one of the world's most difficult locales, is now on the slate. There are also fantasy EA courses like The Predator, which have made it into the PC version. You have access to all 18 courses via Simulation mode, so you won't need to unlock anything if you don't want to.    The Tiger Challenge, which was the core single-player experience for 2003 on consoles, has been revamped and is now in the PC version. Called the Would Tour mode, you conquer different areas of the globe one-by-one. World Tour is a really excellent mode for casual golfing. You're not locked into 12 months of serious gameplay where a few losses will damage your whole career. While it doesn't seem like a good fit with the simulation style of the PC, it actually works nicely as an arcade style mode that you can jump in and out of.     However, like most of the experience in the PC version, it's still catered towards the hardcore userbase and features an almost RPG-like setup. Before you even compete in a major tournament on a course, you must first pass through a regiment of scenarios and earn enough skill points. So, in a sense, you have to level-up your experience on the links before you take on bigger challenges. The whole Career mode is designed around this concept. Golf Lessons are required before you even start, in fact, and to learn new skills you have to earn cash so you can buy new instruction. It is extremely unique in its setup, but developer Headgate has been catering specifically to the PC crowd for years. It's a niche style of gameplay meant to challenge hardcore golfers and, trust us, you definitely will be. Tiger 2004 is very difficult on the PC if you're adhering to the TrueSwing method.     Of course, what you do in Career mode earns you money and you need more to spend it on more than just statistic upgrades, don't you? That's what the Pro Shop is for, and it's tied in quite intimately with the Career mode. Everything you do in Tiger Woods 2004 eventually leads you back to the Pro Shop. As you win in World Tour and as you play on the PGA circuit, and as you conquer Scenarios you will earn new goodies. The scope of items included is pretty huge. The number is easily over 1,000 and includes gear, apparel, and accessories from Ping, Cleveland, Taylor Made, and many others. All of this stuff costs lots of cash, which gives you a good deal more incentive to play well on the courses. Unlike the console versions, it does not have daily sales and featured items, nor a calendar that bases itself on a real-time clock. EA poured a lot of content into it and teamed up with some pretty excellent licensees. Taking full advantage of these relationships, EA has set things up so you will eventually earn sponsorships which leads to bonuses and, of course, more gear. No golf game to date has offered this much customization and it makes a world of difference. It's a feature we could not live without going forward. Our only complaint would be that surfing through all the items, previewing them, and the general look of it all is a bit messy. It's more utilitarian than anything else, so we really look forward to seeing how this is improved in the next version.    Then there is the king of all additions: Game Face. It's so in-depth and satisfying you'll want to take a cold shower after perusing it. We've successfully made characters that closely resemble a number of the IGN editors; yes, it's so powerful you can even make extremely ugly people. We've picked our jaws up off the floor repeatedly. EA wants you to play as you in this year's version, and with enough patience and skill you'll be doing just that. It only further supports the concept that Tiger Woods 2004 is a bit of a golf RPG for PC. You can tweak just about everything. Sure, it has the standard stuff -- hairstyles, facial hair, face types, skin color, etc. -- but it's the ability to tweak the size of individual bones, body mass, and so on that makes it really amazing. We're absolutely positive it will quickly find its way into other EA franchises like NBA Street -- it's just too good not to have around. Combined with the Pro Shop, it's just short of living digitally inside the world EA has created. It's the ultimate in newfangled-ness. For those that don't care much for it, you can randomize a character easily.     Indeed, Game Face is what really brings everything together this year, making the franchise as cohesive and complete as it has ever been. So, you can rest assured that all the new modes and features are great. But, how does it control, a huge part of the experience? If you've played the previous PC iterations of Tiger Woods you should know to expect a simulation of the real world. If you use the TrueSwing method, and you definitely should, you will find that your life in the tee box, the fairway, and the rough is always unpredictable. Your swing is rated on its tempo, its straightness, and any inconsistency is measured. This means it's very easy to duff the ball, to draw your shot when you don't want to, or to, say, send it flying into the water to its tragic end. This scenario plays out much like real sport; that's what makes the PC version spectacular in its own right. It has the all the glamour of Game Face, the stocked Pro Shop, online play, and tons of courses, but the gameplay mechanics are custom designed for simulation fans. Oh and don't worry, putting is still extremely realistic and trying. If you want to sink birdie shots and eagles, you'll need to know the weight of your putter and be able to read the greens without doubt. Simulation fans will love this. If this all sounds like an exercise in frustration to you, however, it probably will be. There's nothing forgiving about it. The developers have created Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 for the golfing videogamers out there that demand a serious challenge.     When you compile the depth of Game Face, the importance of Pro Shop, the new courses, the RPG-like setup, the hardcore simulation gameplay, and the replay value of online, this 2004 edition is easily the best yet. Get rid of last year's version and make the upgrade. It's well worth it and has more than enough to keep you occupied for many, many months to come.   Graphics  Headgate Studios, unsatisfied with last year's look, has given just about every element a boost. Textures are more detailed, there is a lot more foliage, modeling is better, and it takes advantage of nVidia pixel shaders for more detailed grass. We ran the game on a P4 2.6GHz machine with 1GB RAM and a GeForce 5200. At a resolution of 1024x768, it ran fairly well, but with framerate hitches occasionally and an overall inability to keep at 60, we preferred to bump the graphics settings down a bit. It has a built-in optimizer that will examine your system specs if you don't want to fiddle with it.   Over last year, it's a marked improvement. Textures could stand to be a bit more diverse, but there's no denying it's one of the best looking real-time 3D golf titles out there.   Sound  This year David Feherty returns, but Bill Macatee has not. Instead, Feherty's new partner in fairway rhyme is Gary McCord. Thanks to this new bond, a lot of the commentary is completely new and fresh. However, McCord's announcing seems a bit more pushed than Macatee's, especially compared to Feherty's, whose is still the best they come; thankfully, you here plenty from him.   Very unlike the console versions, all the music supplied for menu surfing is composed in-house and not EA Trax. Its style works just fine, but eventually you'll want to boot up your MP3 player in the background if your system can handle it.   Lastly, as for environmental sound effects, it supports fully 3D positional audio. Wherever the camera is placed, you are surrounded by effects. Whether it's the waves crashing against the rocks in the distance, or the rustling of tree leaves behind you, you can hear it well. They did an excellent job crafting a solid aural experience.I had played some of Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 on the PC, but because I didn't have a computer that could handle it, I ended up spending more time on the consoles, despite my desire to reap the benefits of the available PGA mode. Now that I've got a more satisfying taste of 2004, I can see that I've been missing out. I'm a simulation golf fan. I always have been. I enjoy golf in real life. And as much as I want to bend my driver around a tree, it's when some skill shines through that you feel good about your game.This is what I really like about Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004. It's made for golfers. You're going to duff it. You're going to find yourself in the rough more than enough times, but you're also going to find your way out. And when you get a hole in one (and I have already!), you become elated. This latest edition is also quite interesting in that it is home to a role-playing feel, where golf lessons are required, practice is mandatory, and using Game Face to create yourself tops it all off. There's just a ton of golf to experience here, and I highly recommend Tiger 2004. The online scene is sure to be crawling with activity, too, which is going to extend this replay value significantly. Plus, just imagine how sweet it will be to play as yourself against others online. That's very sweet -- you might even get recognized on one of your local courses. Or not, but you can dream about it.", "date": "Sep 24, 2003"}
