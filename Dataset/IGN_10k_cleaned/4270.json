The EAD-created title was -- with simple, but responsive control mechanics and then-gorgeous graphics -- as good as snowboarding games got. It was so good, in fact, that it took publishing giant Electronic Arts several years and a far more powerful console to give it solid competition -- of course we're referring to the birth of the SSX franchise on PlayStation 2.   Since then, though, a lot has changed. Nowadays, SSX is the reigning snowboarding king, not 1080, and the latest installment in Nintendo's franchise, 1080: Avalanche, does little to change that. The NST-developed sequel is a fun snowboarding game with an impressive sense of speed and entertaining avalanche elements, but it's also relatively shallow, not to mention decidedly less intuitive and less refined than efforts from the competition.  The Facts  Official sequel to the hit N64 racer 1080: Snowboarding Play as five different snowboarders including Ricky Winterborn and Rob Haywood Unlock new boards including a penguin Bust out a variety of different grabs, spins and flips for style and points In Match Race, shred down 15 standard tracks on novice, hard and expert modes. Then unlock Extreme Challenge and race seven additional courses Other modes include Gate Challenge, Trick Attack and Time Trial Features four-player split-screen multiplayer mode Four-player LAN Progressive scan support Dolby Pro Logic II support Requires three memory blocks for saves   Gameplay Avalanche doesn't aspire to be anything but the sequel to the original 1080 Snowboarding, a truth which becomes very clear from the moment you boot the title up. The interface, well designed but simple, is modeled around a 3D cabin and it's in this fitting locale that you can select from the different mode types and boarders and then begin the race. The menu system is perhaps less impressive than the one in the Nintendo 64 game, especially considering that it's little changed and five years more advanced -- the cabin is barren, seeming to be almost empty and lacks in both graphic geometry and texture clarity -- but it gets the job done.  This 1080 sequel is very much modeled after the winning formula that powered the original game. It's a snowboarder with a greater emphasis on speed -- on flat out racing -- than on tricks and air time and it's here that the game is a success. The developer has done a fine job of making Avalanche look and feel fast and as a result you will find yourself sucked into many of its race scenarios.   However, the real show stealer are the destructive avalanches in the game, which are extremely well done, occasionally huge and frantic, and extraordinarily entertaining. You'll outrace snow waves, dodge falling trees and rolling boulders, jump objects and take turns, and you'll do it all with the screen shaking and with a dangerous force chasing right behind. Indeed, if there were more avalanches in the game, we might have rated it higher because it's these elements that are most enjoyable. Actually, enjoyable is not the word. Insane, rather, is more descriptive. We highly recommend downloading this video to get an idea of what we mean. The problem, though, is that standard races -- still fun, but not nearly as compelling -- take up the majority of the game, and the full-blown avalanche levels, only a couple, seem more like bonuses.    The racer controls similarly to its predecessor -- adequately, but with some limitations. The analog stick steers boarders left and right and sharp turns can be introduced by pulling back. Meanwhile, the L button is used to duck and gain speed and tapped for smooth landings, while R button spins, A jumps, and B, Y and X all perform various grabs. The riders are heavier and more difficult to maneuver than the quick, agile pros in EA's game and this can be frustrating, especially when you have to turn on a dime. We don't mean to suggest that the mechanics are unintuitive because they're not -- just different. Correctly timing landings and zooming downhill at obnoxious speeds is very satisfying. That noted, we'd be lying if we wrote that we didn't prefer the lighter physics and quicker responsiveness in SSX.      There are some additions that we like. The balance meter is very well implemented. If you land poorly the meter will pop up, along with fittingly disorienting blur and slow down effects, and you'll have only a few sections to spin the analog stick wildly in order to balance your character or they will take a fall. We also like the enhanced grinding system, which now also utilizes a balance meter. Oppositely, though, we're still not believers in the clunky, underdeveloped trick system. It was the weakest aspect of the original 1080 and it remains exactly so in this sequel -- perhaps even worse, actually, because spinning for 1080s, which was once incredibly difficult, is now ultra-easy as all you have to do is hold the R button.   There is a healthy selection of four gameplay modes, all of them entertaining for different reasons. The main draw is Match Race, which features 15 standard tracks spread across novice, hard and expert modes. This -- the meat and potatoes of the game -- is fun while it lasts, but it doesn't last long. Once you beat one circuit, another is unlocked. If you're good enough -- which isn't difficult -- you'll eventually (see: within the hour) unlock Extreme Challenge, which includes a final mishmash of seven courses from the other circuits. You'll have fun with these, too, but because the tracks are so short -- many less than a minute -- the races are over soon after they've begun, which is a big disappointment, especially if you've just come from playing the gargantuan sized tracks in SSX 3.  Avalanche also features Time Trial, Trick Attack and Gate Challenge modes and these certainly extend replay value some. We had initially expected these offerings to be rather meaningless -- just afterthoughts -- but this couldn't be further from the truth. Each mode is fun and challenging and all of them offer unlockables like new snowboards, which can then be raced in any mode. We found ourselves very drawn into both the Time Trial and Gate Challenge modes in particular as they both revolve around speed, an element which Avalanche does very well. Trick Attack will satisfy, too, but it fails in comparison to the more robust system in SSX.  Finally, the multiplayer modes are welcomed. The four-player split-screen offering plays just as you would hope. You can race from a small selection of tracks which you have unlocked in the Match Race mode and the split-screen action -- yes, even in four-player mode -- runs very well. No major framerate drops. No huge, glaring loss in detail. It just works. And that makes us very happy. On top of this, the title features a four-player LAN mode. Yeah -- only four players, a disappointment given that you can go against just as many people in split-screen action. Still, if you're one of the lucky who can afford to setup at least two GameCubes, two copies of 1080, two televisions and a hub connection, you're in for a treat.  Graphics We took a look at the original 1080 to refresh our memories before we delved into Avalanche and there are a lot of similarities here. The deep snow effects, the wavering clothing on riders, and the style and presentation of the occasionally branching courses are all recognizable between the two. But NST's game is expectedly prettier, for the most part. Levels are just as varied. The title boasts locales engulfed in snowstorms, set to the backdrop of factories, during day and night, and with various weather effects like rain and sleet. The weather effects in place are gorgeous -- some of the best we've seen. There is more going in within each level. Objects animate in the background, there is wildlife like deer, people on skis and snowmobiles, and more, and all of these extras add a layer of realism to the environments.   The riders themselves aren't overly impressive. They are constructed using a moderate degree of polygons and as such lack roundness and detail. Meanwhile, textures -- acceptable -- aren't as crisp or defined as they could be. Boarders animate fluidly enough, but there's a certain stiffness to them that wasn't identifiable in the original game. We looked at the two closely to confirm. The boarders don't duck and angle as realistically as they did in the previous title -- a style we preferred. Still, the animation is better than most of what's out there in the snowboarding genre with the notable exception of EA's game, which is far superior in this regard.    The title runs in progressive scan, a plus for HDTV owners and the fluidity aspires to be 60 frames per second but fails. Well, it mostly fails. The title will run at 60 frames for brief spurts and then drop to 30 frames, and occasionally it'll dip further still. The fluidity as a result can feel inconsistent at times, which is a disappointment, but only a slight one. Most will probably not take issue with the motion.    Sound Very well done.  Avalanche runs in Dolby Pro Logic II for a full surround sound experience and it features crisp sound effects, from the rumble of avalanches to the swoosh of the wind as it ripples the clothing of riders. Some of the one-liners from riders are a bit goofy, but the quality is respectable. For once, in a welcomed move, Nintendo has opted to use licensed music from a variety of fairly cutting-edge rock and techno artists and as a result the game's music is usually worth listening to. The only downside is that some of the rock tunes run a bit on the slow side and don't at all mix with the action of the levels.1080: Avalanche is a fun snowboarding game that you'll probably like if you prefer speed over tricks in your downhill experience. That's basically what it boils down to, really, for this title's sense of speed is very satisfying and its avalanche elements make for absolute frenzied entertainment.I have to say that I'm disappointed that more advancements weren't introduced to the series. The sequel sometimes feels as if Nintendo handed NST a template to work with and didn't allow the developer any freedom to stray from the formula. You know, the original 1080 was great for its time -- one of my favorites -- but five years later games have advanced, trick systems have advanced, and to see such a similar, relatively shallow trick system in this sequel is a wee bit puzzling. And yet, my issues with a lack of innovation in certain areas noted, I still had fun with the title, its trick challenges and all, and so I can't knock it too much.What I can knock is the game's overall difficulty, or lack thereof. You can beat it in a couple of hours and it feels downright shallow compared to SSX 3, which serves up hours and hours and hours of entertainment. I also have some issues with the game's control mechanics and physics, which can feel too heavy and occasionally unresponsive.This is not a perfect snowboarder by any stretch of the imagination. But I would recommend that anyone and everybody rent it to see the few, but amazing avalanche stages in motion, if for nothing else. And if you liked the first game, I think you'll probably enjoy this sequel despite its shortcomings.", "date": "Dec 2, 2003"}
