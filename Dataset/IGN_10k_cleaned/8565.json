These games featured flawless construction (far superior to the plastic crap Tiger passes off today) and gloriously simple game play. Nintendo's Game & Watch Gallery is a game created with a singular purpose: to pay homage to Nintendo's LCD heritage. It does this stunningly.   Features  One player game. Super Game Boy enhanced. Battery backed save with Interrupt feature  Four distinct games, each with a Classic and Modern version and each of THOSE with a hard and easy version.  Difficulty level: Easy to Hard.   The Game Included in Gallery are four G&W classics: ~Octopus,~ ~Fire,~ ~Manhole,~ and ~Oil Panic.~ In ~Octopus~ you are a diver who must retrieve treasure while dodging the arms of an irritable octopus. In ~Fire~ you must rescue the victims of a skyscraper fire by using a net to bounce them into a waiting ambulance. In ~Manhole~ you must use a manhole lid to prevent pedestrians from falling into four open manholes. Finally, in ~Oil Panic,~ a multi-screen game, you are a gas station attendant who must collect drops of oil as they drip from the ceiling and then pass them to your partner waiting outside. Nintendo has included not only a perfect translation of each of these games (~Classic Mode~), but also updated versions of each game (~Modern Mode~) which feature cameos by the Nintendo gang (Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Donkey Kong Jr., Koopa, Toad, and Princess Toadstool) and enhanced graphics, control, and play options. For example, in the updated version of ~Octopus,~ the octopus' arms are more mobile, you slow down as you try to haul more treasure, and you can fend off the octopus by throwing treasure at it.   Each of the games has a hard or easy version for both Classic and Modern modes. So there are essentially four variations of each game. Game & Watch Gallery is battery backed, so all your scores are saved. It even offers an ~Interrupt Save~ feature which allows you to shut off the unit in the middle of a game and then resume play next time you power on. Suffice it to say, this is a feature never dreamed of by old school G&W fans, who would have been happy with a measly pause button (which Game & Watch Gallery also includes, of course).  Game & Watch Gallery gets its name from the fact that it actually includes a gallery of Game & Watches called ~Gallery Corner.~ As a reward for achieving a set high score on each of the four versions of each game, a Game & Watch is revealed in the gallery. This gallery contains 16 original Game & Watches, each title with a release date, series number, one sentence description, and an animation of the gameplay. For collectors and casual fans alike this is a great incentive to keep playing for that high score!    Graphically, Nintendo has done a beautiful job of providing faithful visual translations of the LCD originals in the Classic games. I was more impressed, though, with the way in which the Modern versions of the games added visual pizzazz while effectively preserving the original feel. There are dozens of nifty visual touches throughout the game, from Mario furiously playing his Game Boy on the title screen, to the bouncing, flipping, happy menu items, to the tears the octopus sheds when you tag the poor fella with a bit of treasure.    The music is varied and pleasant, but can be turned on or off in any game should you choose. The songs are extended compositions, meaning that they will not get annoyingly repetitive during long games. Sounds are abundant and effectively used. A good example of this is the way the ~clink~ of coins being tossed into your sack in the Modern version of ~Octopus~ deepens as the bag becomes fuller. This is important, as how full your bag is determines how quickly you will be able to return to your boat on the surface.  The object of this game is simple: achieve high scores. Therefore, if you're looking for a game that constantly reveals new aspects of gameplay, seek elsewhere. ~Gallery Corner~ adds a good bit of value for folks curious about these little handheld wonders and incentive to keep playing the game, beyond the inherent opportunity for fun that each game presents. If you are completely uninterested in Game & Watches, I imagine the game would have less draw for you. Still, switching between the 16 different game configurations available keeps the game fresh and entertaining. Also, I've seen this game new in bargain bins at WalMart for $15.  Whether you adore Game & Watches or could care less, Game & Watch Gallery is mindless button mashing at its best. It's up there with Tetris and Dr. Mario on my list of ~twitch~ games. Moreover, reverence for the original G&W line is evident in this pak, which fans will appreciate. It is interesting to note that a Color GB version of this game and a sequel are both on the way.
