Eric Idle, of Monty Python fame, supplied the voice for the lead character, the wizard Rincewind, and the game was genuinely funny. However, long load times and an excruciatingly slow pace of action marred the game.  Based on the works of best-selling British fantasy writer Terry Pratchett, Discworld II: Mortality Bytes! finds Rincewind filling in for the Grim Reaper after an exploding bomb sends Death reeling into retirement. Sorting souls isn't on Rincewind's list of career choices, so he sets out to bring the vacationing Death back into employment.  Idle is back again, and it's his clever witticisms that carry the game, more so than the puzzles, which are satisfactory at best. Getting through the game can be occasionally tedious. The point and click interface is never the best control mechanism on the PlayStation, and Discworld 2 is no exception.  Although the game is sometimes clever, in the end, it's the laughs that make this game even vaguely interesting. If you're a fan of Douglas Adams or Monty Python, you'll probably appreciate the humor and have fun. If you're not interested in page flipping point and click adventures then this is probably a game you'll want to pass on.", "date": "Sep 25, 1997"}
