The Tom Clancy series has had a lot to do with the general growth of squad-based first-person shooters, but let's just say that that fateful day in our history was the straw that broke the camel's back. Pandemic Studios, known for its earlier work with Activision on Battlezone II and Dark Reign and more recently, on games such as Army Men RTS and Star Wars: The Clone Wars, is now creating its unique insignia in the military arena with the ingenious and entirely original Full Spectrum Warrior (check the full video review here).    Full Spectrum Warrior is not a realtime strategy game, but it's like one. It's not a first- or third-person shooter, but it's like one, and it's not a straight action game, but it's certainly, well, very much like one. The fact is, Pandemic's original strategy-based, tactical military simulator comprises components of all these things and is genuinely a bird of a different color.   THQ's game is a rich, Oh-My-God experience thanks to its innovative game design, its beautiful graphics and excellent technology, and because it's one of those genre-bending games that does something few have imagined before. The team-based combat is incredibly engaging because it demands you to think strategically, to use your limited resources, and outthink the opponent. It's thoroughly deep when it comes to tactical strategy, and it's a demanding game, but it's not perfect.    While the combat is intense and the tactics are amazing by design, the multiplayer should include more than just a cooperative mode, and the game opens up many unanswered questions, such as, why can't I drive a tank, why isn't the replay better, why can't I snipe in more levels, or why am I always on the ground, instead of up in buildings? If the answer is, ~But this is a realistic military simulator,~ Or, ~It's designed to do one thing well.~ My answer is, then why am I playing it on my Xbox? It's a game, and as one, it satisfies many of my combat urges, but not all of them, and with the ones left unsatisfied, this amazing game known as Full Spectrum Warrior has left me hanging.    Presentation  The first and most important thing about Full Spectrum Warrior is you have to figure out what the hell you're doing. The game looks complex, and it is, but the smart guys at Pandemic have whittled down the game's mechanics to just a few buttons, and to educate you so that it all makes sense in terms of analog sticks and letter buttons, Pandemic's mandatory, long-ass tutorial puts things in perspective for you. It's essentially Full Spectrum Warrior boot camp, and you'd going to need the 45-minute training, soldier. Of course, if you think you've got the nards to jump right in, then you can connect to Xbox Live with a teammate without the training. But seriously, you're just going to piss people off because it will be clear right from the get-go you're clueless.      Once you've passed it, the game opens like a war movie, sort of. Introduced to you through narration are the members of Team Alpha and Bravo, who happen to not just be nameless, faceless guys with guns. They come from homes; they have backgrounds. They're as real as polygons get, quipping with one another, making side jokes, and in all, giving the game a huge dose of personality. This intro movie is absolutely brilliant, and what's more, unexpected. After so much time playing military sims and the like, who would have thought that the ultimate military simulator would have so much personality and color?    The replay system is a life-saver, and it's another big plus in the game's sophistication. If you die or want to replay a level, you can watch the entire set of missions using play, pause and fast-forward. The bitchin' part is that you can jump into the game at any point of the replay. The smart part is that you can watch your successes and mistakes, and you can then re-do them perfectly. The hilarious part is that the voices are sped up, so it sounds like Alvin the Chipmunks are fighting in the streets of Afghanistan. The bummer part is that the replay could have been more robust. You should be able, like in Madden, to stop the motion at any point, and then take a look at the scenario from any angle -- this is good for making the game look cool, but again, to learn from mistakes. Then you should also be able to rewind, and fast-fast forward, too. It's still damn good, just not perfect.   Gameplay  Originally commissioned by the U.S. Army to train light Infantry troops in urban combat situations, Full Spectrum Warrior gives you a real sense of what urban combat is like from a tactical standpoint without ever actually suiting up. Using an innovative camera system that follows two, sometimes three combat teams from a flexible third-person perspective, you thrust teams into combat issuing commands to find cover, use suppressing fire, and tactically eliminate the enemy. You don't actually shoot the trigger, you command your troops to do so. That's the thing about Full Spectrum Warrior, in many ways it functions like a realtime strategy game. The single-player game is moderately long, ranging from 11-14 hours (depending on your skill level) over 11 consuming levels, and there are two difficulty levels, plus a cooperative Xbox Live mode enabling players to play the same levels again.     Unlike a top-down RTS, like say, Warcraft III, the camera perspectives are on the ground level, right in the action. The game's mechanics are essentially flawless, starting with the dynamic camera. When controlling a team, the camera sits on the team leader's head, and you can manually swivel the camera around him, looking up, down and in any direction. He can see as far as an ordinary soldier would. Fog of war blurs out areas either not useable of too far in the distance. Making things more flexible is the ability to switch to any particular member of the squad using the Dpad, indicated by the symbol on screen (TL -- team leader, R -- rifleman, G - grenadier, AR -- automatic riflemen). The team works as a unit, always keeping formation, covering all sides, and lining up together to fight or what have you.      The entire game is all about finding the most strategic cover, outflanking, and defeating your enemy. By using a floating cursor comprising four connected circles (each representing a soldier), Pandemic gives players the ability to find cover, sometimes even beyond where they could actually see. A simple library of icons  show you what kind of cover you have selected, be it on a corner, bunched behind a vehicle, or lined up against a wall. When covered using a corner, the camera once again comes in beautifully, swiveling around the corner and providing you with ample view of the environment and/or enemies in it. If you mess up big time, you can always press B for cover, which commands your team to find cover ASAP.   If you've played Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3, then outflanking your enemies in Full Spectrum Warrior will be relatively old hat. You control both Alpha and Bravo teams and sometimes a third team, and alternate between them to clear out the streets of Zekistan, a fictitious Middle-Eastern city rife with terrorists. The game is designed for you to alternate between them (using Y) at any time, and by setting each up in smart locations, you can outflank, outsmart or surprise your enemy. Your two four-man teams are equipped each with a rifle, your grenadier with smoke grenades, frag grenades, an M203 grenade launcher, the ability to call in air strikes, and to call in your positioning; and your team leader handles the radio, communicating with HQ. Though players control the team itself always in a group, using the Dpad, you can call out any particular individual to aim at individual enemies.    The soldiers respond to you relatively quickly, but not as fast as I'd like. It's not like there is a technology delay, but they have to listen to your command, pause, and then react. This period of time gets you in a lot of trouble, and even if it's realistic, I wish the squads reacted faster. If I command cover, then they should hit the deck immediately. If I tell them to shoot, it feels like it takes too long. Also, the AI doesn't always follow the best or safest path to its destination.     The level design is excellent; it ranges from forcing you to slog through tough narrow areas, to wide-open freeform terrain. And peppering the many urban areas, be they sandstorm thrashed commercial streets, decadent palaces, or the charred remains of a burnout out plane, the AI enemy can be challenging. The majority of the time you fight little pockets of enemies, but every so often you'll face enemies with RPGs, snipers, mobile techs, and tanks. Sometimes the AI simply be forced to move by flanking into his territory, but most times, they are entrenched behind cover, and you'll have to figure out whether an RPG or a change of cover is best. Later on, when grenades come flying at you, and multiple snipers appear from nowhere, its gets incredibly fun. Then, you're more likely to bound (to shoot while moving), and pay attention to the direction of the wind when using a smoke grenade.      The Xbox Live function is kick-ass, even if it's somewhat limited. The Xbox Live function enables two players to play against the AI enemy online. When Hilary and I played it was fantastic. Just passing the first level we were like, Holy SH*T!, this is cool! And after you've finished the single-player game, playing through with a friend is without a doubt going to be riveting. But it's not enough.    The thing about Full Spectrum Warrior is that it's deep, thorough, and original; there is no question about that. Usually, that's all you could hope to ever ask for in a game. But here, once you get two-thirds or three-fourths into it, the dynamic doesn't fully bloom. You get deep into it and it stays right like that for the rest of the game. It doesn't evolve with little interesting hooks, or really go to that unbelievable next level. Coming away from it, I was left wanting more. I wanted to take on the role of the rangers, to snipe away at single enemies. To man a tank from inside or on top. Like in an RTS, I wanted to group my commands, so I could tell both teams to move simultaneously; and I wanted to stack my commands, so squads could move to point A, then B, then C from one command. After finishing it, I wanted to play through the game with randomly generated enemies, so even if the maps were the same, the enemies would be in different locations, essentially making the known maps brand new again. And I so desperately want adversarial co-op in Xbox Live. In short, after getting my fill of this game, I want more, and there just isn't that final whopping knockout punch that I was looking for. Don't make the mistake that I don't love this game, it's great. But there is lots of room for improvement.    Graphics  Pandemic has easily created its best looking game yet. Full Spectrum Warrior is an amazing blend of opposites. It's filled with beautiful skies with distinctive clouds, and brilliantly lit scenes, some with colorful light piercing through the dust from exploding cars and tanks, while in other scenarios you just see a shard of light coming through a grating, and it's awesome. The artists use pastel colors when they can, but it's the lighting techniques that really shine through, giving the game its gorgeous hues.     The environments generally are re-creations of poor, beat up Middle Eastern cities, but there are all sorts of levels that distinguish themselves. In the one level where a group of chickens happily pecked away, there was also a mass grave. Another distinctive level occurs when you've entered a palace, and the texture work all of sudden isn't torn up buildings and roads, its complex tile work, beautiful indigo blues and golds, and perfect palace architecture.      The particles system is awesome. Many cover spots are actually totally destructible, such as cars, crates, couches, and the like, and as you shoot them, you can see bits, panels, and shards fly off. Watching an RPG smash into a car is also a great sight to be seen. The game uses Havoc physics, but it's not as obvious here as it is in many other games. It's there, but it's just not so in your face. Lastly, the smoke, fire, and explosions are all great to watch. Oh yeah, and duh, the soldiers themselves are all distinctive, with believable movements, and all sorts of amazingly detailed animations and behaviors. Almost like they were alive.    Sound  Featuring in-game Dolby Digital sound, this game offers a sensational set of effects ranging from the smallest ones, such as a group of chickens found in an alleyway clucking away, to the slam of an RPG exploding a vehicle right next to your soldiers, and hearing the parts sprinkle down on the ground around you. The overall technical effects are solid, and they're backed up by a mixture of songs, which in all honesty, are far more interesting than almost all other military games. Being based on the fictitious Zekistan, you'll hear Middle Eastern influenced background songs, plus atmospheric military themes that have a slightly psychedelic bent. The song writers do little unusual things here with military-ish themes, like bending notes and holding them for long periods of time, or using slightly less popular chords, providing a more interesting take on the normally conservative taps.   Much of the game comprises the voices of your squadmates and the comments they make before, during, and after a conflict. You'll hear several lines repeated, an inevitably dull event, but many of them are still excellent ones. ~Man, what was he thinking? He's f*cking with the US army!~ Or, ~That's one less asshole to deal with.~ Or, in the beginning, one of the better conversations follows this line of thinking: ~'He's doing that cause I'm black.' 'You've got it all wrong, man, black is a state of mind.' 'Listen up soldiers,' the US color that matters right now is the color of the US army, Green.' 'Um, Brown. Sir, not that I would never correct you sir, but we're really more brown, sir.'~ The point is, listen carefully to what these guys say. They're a kick.   In the end, Full Spectrum Warrior is an amazing achievement in design, and really, it's an amazingly visionary and original piece of code, full stop. Sure, there is room for improvement, but the game is still top-notch at every level of development and execution, and Pandemic's final product is a beautiful thing to look at, to play, and to compare to anything else in the marketplace. As a game, it's thorough, deep, compelling, and it gives players something genuinely unique to play alone or with a friend. It could be longer, it could have more modes of play, and it could, nay, should, have an adversarial online ability, but I guess that's why they have sequels. Perhaps it's because Pandemic literally spent two years working on perfecting the camera system so that they couldn't spend more time on multiplayer modes, I don't know. What I do know is that if you own an Xbox and want a daring, awesome game to play this summer, you cannot go wrong with Full Spectrum Warrior.", "date": "Jun 1, 2004"}
