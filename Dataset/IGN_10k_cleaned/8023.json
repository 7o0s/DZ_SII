With the timing off and awareness sinking, it's an odd time for THQ Wireless to release the mobile edition of the game. However, this Universomo-developed game has a couple tricks up its sleeve that might ensnare a few humans like so many mind control rays. The biggest change: This sequel's turn-based strategy mechanics are a complete departure from the first game's total action-oriented game play. It's a quizzical choice, but with so many action games out there, catering to fans of the strategy genre might just work to THQ Wireless' benefit.   The wisecracking Cryptosporidium is back, scouring the surface of the planet for Furon DNA and a few good minds to bend to his will. He's armed with such goodies as a laser rifle, grenades, and anal probes -- but he cannot just use these willy-nilly to take out pesky people and harvest the necessary DNA. Crypto only has so many Action Points (AP) per turn, so you have to move, shoot, and manipulate objects like doors and computers with a certain degree of caution. During each mission, Crypto can use mind control to enslave a team of helpers, from medics to mercs. After a couple missions, Destroy All Humans! 2 reveals itself to be a strangely traditional turn-based strategy game.   What this means, of course, is that Destroy All Humans! 2 moves at a methodical pace. (This is a nice way of saying slow.) Every mission has a specific primary objective you must meet, plus a handful of secondary objectives that bump your score and give you access to increased weapons and whatnot. There is a degree of trial-and-error in the game as you strive for these objectives, especially due to the fact that Crypto and his minions can only see targets in their field of vision. If you're facing away from a hall when your turn ends, you might find yourself shot in the back repeatedly (and helplessly) during the computer-controlled characters' turns. It's maddening, but it's also just part of the genre.   The solution to situations like this is to use the minions as scouts and pointmen. Crypto may not be able to see around a corner, but he can peer through the eyes of an enslaved medic at the end of the hall who can. When everything clicks into place and you use your team like a well-oiled machine, spotting guards earlier than they see you, Destroy All Humans! 2 is actually kinda fun. Get out of sync and burn through your AP before one minions has a chance to save Crypto from a room full of guards, though, and Destroy All Humans! 2 will have you reaching for the ~end~ key.   Destroy All Humans! 2's sense of humor does its darnedest to save the game from its pokey pacing. The writing is strong. Crypto is still a complete SOB and it is fun to read his interactions with Pox, his handler in the mothership.   The visuals in Destroy All Humans! 2 are a mixed bag. The character portraits and weapon effects are good. The environments and sprites on the battlefield are very, very basic. The game does have good music, though, so you won't be reaching for your volume rocker.  Destroy All Humans! 2 is definitely not for everybody -- and that even includes fans of the action-oriented series of console games. This is a slow-paced strategy game with some degree of depth, but I'm concerned that fans that buy off the brand alone will be disappointed. The game does maintain the series' trademark sense of humor and has some good little touches that I enjoyed, but I found the pacing -- which is sometimes borderline glacial -- really undermining my enjoyment of the game.", "date": "Feb 8, 2007"}
