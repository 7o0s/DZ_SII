Hell, some of these elfs and orcs even fell in love and married over this cultural phenomenon.  And now it's found a way into your cellphone.  What will you forsake to spend more time with EverQuest?  Features: Traditional RPG gameplay 32 dungeons Item and weapon management Save your progress  First things first, despite residing on a telephone, this handheld EverQuest is not a MMORPG.  You do not join up with other adventurers to take on the evils of the world and steal items from dead characters in your party.  No, this EverQuest is a strictly one-player experience.  And it's a fairly traditional RPG to boot, featuring item, spell, and weapon management as you clear dungeon after dungeon of marauding foes.  Not that there's anything wrong with the change of pace.  In fact, it's rather nice to have a solid little RPG for on-the-go swordplay and spellcasting.  The first time you fire up EverQuest, you get to create a character from scratch, choosing between a magician or a warrior.  Name your character, and it's off to town, where a tavern serves as your homebase.  The barkeep serves as your impromptu dungeon master, keeping you abreast of available quests.  You'll enter the initial dungeon poorly prepared, wearing tattered armor and wielding a crappy little knife.  Thankfully, the monsters in this series of catacombs aren't terribly thick-skinned.  A few pokes with your rusty blade usually do the trick.  Clear it out a few times to gain a level or two of experience, earn gold to upgrade your weapon, and hopefully stumble upon some better gear.  Then it's back to to town to get your next mission--which usually consists of killing a specific beastie, or finding a hidden item.  Take your time, as building experience pays off in later dungeons.  These monsters don't remain a cakewalk for very long, and you never know what kind of goodies you'll find in the treasure chests to happen across.  EverQuest is more of an action RPG, as it's battles are handled by walking up to a creature and hitting the action button (~Select~ on the Motorola T720) as fast as you can.  Keep a close watch on your health bar at the bottom of the screen.  Should you get low, just find an empty alcove and wait, or use one of the provided shortcut keys to nosh on some health-giving fare like Wolf Steaks.  Dungeons are viewed from a slightly angled top down view, not unlike the old Ys games on the TurboGrafx-16 and Sega Master System.  The visuals are pleasant, with detailed and different foes wandering the hallways of this strange land's plentiful dungeons.  The dungeons also manage to look different, thanks to switched out textures, something that many of today's console games can't even manage.  (I'm looking at you, Evolution Worlds.)  Due to the quality of the visuals and the desire to keep EverQuest's memory footprint down, there is little audio, save for a stirring melody during the opening and on the menu screens. Unfortunately, EverQuest doesn't contain nearly level of customization of its PC uncle, but it's hard to pick on a game that not only fills a void in the cellphone game library, but does so quite well.  Perhaps a future edition of the title will go online, allowing you to partner up with other EverQuest players to trade items and battle boss creatures.  (Already counting that eBay money?)  In the meantime, though, players looking for a little RPG action can do no better than Hero's Call. Wait, I just got that.  Hero's Call.  It's on a cellphone.  You ~call~ on a cellphone.  Those zanies at Sony.", "date": "May 13, 2003"}
