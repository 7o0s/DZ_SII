Legend of the River King, Natsume's latest delightful adventure, is in stores everywhere and packs a tsunami of fun .  Hang a ~Gone Fishing~ sign on your door and kick back, because this quirky semi-RPG is one addiction you won't want to disappear. Features: Fishing RPG hybrid Battery save For Game Boy or Game Boy Color   What do you get when you mix the elements of a fishing game and a role-playing game together?  In this case, one of the most fun portable games out there!  Between two enchanting modes of play, it's difficult to decide where to begin.  ~Should I play the adventure, or should I raise a fish?~  No matter which you choose, you can't go wrong, because each offers a different and fun gameplay experience.  The Fish mode, obviously the bigger enchilada of the two, is where most things occur.  As the hero of the story, [insert your name here], it's up to you to help your sister pull through her illness.  The game starts off simply enough with a moan from your sick sibling.  ~Listen carefully.  To cure Teruyo's disease, we must catch the fish called Guardian~, says your mother.  She explains that no one knows of his whereabouts, and that only you can save the day.  Like most heroes, you utter no reply; instead, you simply head out in your village to find this ~Guardian~ fish.  Thus begins your journey.  One of the first things that is noticeable is the stream which runs through your village.  It's here where you can go either bait or lure fishing, and each has its advantages depending upon the setting. Bait fishing can be accomplished by casting your line out into the water.  Tugged by the current, your line will float downstream until a fish seems interested.  Once your tackle is pulled underwater by a fish, it's time for the real action to begin.  The fish will pull and pull on your line until it either gets away or tires.  When the fish is tired, it's time for you to rapidly press the  A or B button to reel him in.  If you continue to press the button when he tugs back, he'll likely get away with your hook and bait.  This takes quite a bit of practice to get used to.  Lure fishing is quite similar to bait fishing in that you cast your line out into the water.  But instead of having it pulled by the current, you gently reel it in with the A or B button, which attracts fish.  Once there's a bite on your hook, follow the same procedures for bait fishing, and you should have him on a plate in no time.  In addition to fishing, there's also the battle mode, where you encounter enemies of all kinds.  The battles are like most other RPGs in that you can either fight, use a healing item, or run, but there's a little extra feature that requires interaction from the player.  Instead of just pressing A to select the 'fight' command, you have to pay extra attention, because a miniature fist appears on the screen and moves rapidly from place to place.  Remember that old game show, ~Press Your Luck~?  Probably not, but I think of it like that.  The fist will randomly appear, and if you press A while its place happens to be on your victim, you will deal damage.  If not, too bad for you.  It's also advisable to hit your enemy in different locations, because some areas are more liable to sustain damage than others.  If you don't pick a place to hit your enemy after a little while, the fist will pick up enough speed that you will have trouble determining when to let it fly.  The damage you deal is also affected by your health; if your health is high, you'll hurt animals more.  Although you only receive gold from selling fish, the experience points you gain will be valuable in building up your character.  The other way to play Legend of the River King, Raise Mode, is also surprisingly entertaining.  When you begin, you are asked to input the settings for a fish tank, such as the water depth, whether or not there is a current, and what material is used to cover the bottom.  After this, you are started off with a small, 2cm-long runt.  From here on, your goal is to keep your fish stress-free, feed it well, and keep its HP high.  It's best to play the Raise Mode while you're busy with something else.  That way, you won't become completely bored while you wait for your little fish to grow.  Check in periodically by looking at its condition.  If your fish is hungry, you have plenty of food items to choose from.  Perhaps your pet has a taste for frog or worm?  Sprinkle some in your tank.  This will both increase his health and make him happy.  Stress, on the other hand, is something that needs more attention.  If your fish has a big frown by its stress, it's time to make some serious renovations.  Change the setting of your tank by adding different things you think your fish will like.  By putting in a fish resting place, water plants, and other things, stress will slowly reduce itself and your pet will be a happy camper.  Unless, of course, the water is dirty.  That can easily be remedied by the press of a button.  Be patient and your fish will grow slowly larger, one centimeter at a time.  If you keep an eye on it and do what it needs to survive, it should stay happy. Legend of the River King features pleasing and detailed graphics in the standard overhead view.  The adventure looks even more vivid when paired with Game Boy Color, and really stands out in comparison to some of the handheld's bland-looking games.  You could be travelling through the village to nearby territories or pulling on a hefty lunker with your fishing rod.  No matter the case, Natsume deserves a thumb's up for the visuals.  The tunes are also pleasant and quite fitting, and give off a very Japanese aura. If I have any minor complaint with this game, it's that the game is not exactly a real RPG.  There aren't dozens of territories and towns to visit, nor is there a big underlining plot.  Instead, there's a few excuses to toss in some role-playing elements now and then.  The battle mode adds to the feel, but overall it's more about catching the rarest fish out there than anything else.  Nonetheless, Natsume is responsible for this great game, and Legend of the River King is as easy to pick up and play as it is fun.  Pick up this one and you won't be disappointed.", "date": "Feb 3, 2000"}
