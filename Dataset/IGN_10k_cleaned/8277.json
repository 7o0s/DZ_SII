Based on the pod racing sequence featured so prominently in the movie, it's a racing game set in the Star Wars universe, pure and simple. But since millions of people have already piled in to see The Phantom Menace--probably the most eagerly-awaited movie of all time--this game is benefiting from the best product placement of any game, ever.  So it would certainly behoove LucasArts to make sure the game lives up to the movie, and by and large they've succeeded. It's not the greatest racing game ever made, and it is perhaps a little too short and too easy, but it captures the essence of the film's racing sequence and provides just enough challenge and variety and an exhilarating sense of speed to keep gamers--particularly those more into Star Wars than hardcore gaming--enthralled.  The pods themselves are perhaps the most unique part of the game. Consisting of two giant jet engines loosely banded together with an open-air cab for the pilot in tow, the things are fast but fragile. Control consists of acceleration and braking, with the additional twists of a slide, booster, and auto-repair mechanisms. The auto-repair lets you fix engine damage on the fly during the race, and the slide and twist keys let you maneuver around obstacles, but the most important skill to learn is handling the thrust. By tilting the control up and hitting accelerate, you'll run the indicator up to yellow, at which point you can engage the thruster and off you go. But be careful, if you leave the thrust on too long, your engines will overheat, even catch fire.   It is not necessary to learn how to use the thrusters early on in the game, and you can in fact finish the first couple of circuits without once firing them up. But if you want record times, or especially if you want to win in a multiplayer game, using the thrusters is a key bit of strategy.  Another crucial tactic is constantly repairing your pod. Six squares measure the health and temperature of your component parts, and by tapping the repair key while in flight, you can resuscitate your flagging vehicle. Of course if you smash into a rock or a wall or whatever, your pod shatters completely and you respawn in a brand new one, but generally you don't want to do that because you lose precious time waiting for your vehicle to repair. Much better to repair on the fly, and since repairing slows you down, and best of all is to repair on the turns, since that's when you want to slow down anyway.   Strategy also comes into play when you upgrade your pod between races. When you win or place in a race, you get a certain amount of money that can be used to buy upgrades to the different parts of your racer, and if you're a bit short on cash, you can buy damaged parts out of Watto's junk shop. Should you spring for a greater top speed or faster acceleration? Better auto-repair devices or perhaps a better turning ration? While this part of the game does offer some extra interest, frankly the menu-ing system could have been handled better, as it's not always very clear whether or not you just bought a new piece or not. And as far as money goes, it's important to change the payout for the races to ~Winner Takes All~, at least on the first circuit, so you can be assured of getting as much money as possible early in the game. This will pay off when you enter the much more difficult races in the later circuits.  Handling the pod is best done with a gamepad, and for the most part, the controls are smooth and responsive, and each of the twenty or so different pods handles differently. As you win more races and complete more circuits, you can unlock more pods, culminating in Sebulba's pod, the fastest, best pod in the game and the only one with any sort of serious weaponry to attack other players with.  The tracks themselves are fairly varied, some long, some short, with hairpin turns, loops, open areas and narrow windows where you're forced to thread the loop. Visually they are much more diverse, showing off some truly fantastic locations like underwater cities and the dunes of Tatooine. The most annoying tracks are the ones with zero gravity areas, where you're sort of whisked along various tubular tunnels without a lot of control of your vehicle, and a bit too much patience and luck is required in avoiding the tumbling boulders. But overall, the tracks are pretty solid and not overly dependent on finding shortcuts.  The game's graphics are superb with a good card and when you're hurtling past them at high speeds, any blemishes quickly vanish. The framerate maintains a good clip throughout--in short, the PC version of the game is heads and shoulders above the Nintendo 64 version, so if you've been put off by the N64 version's less than stellar performance, be assured that on a high-end PC, the game looks fine and runs fast.  As far as multiplayer games go, it's a pretty good game on a local area network (LAN), where latency is not much of an issue, but since there's no Internet option, if you don't have a LAN you're pretty much out of luck.  --Jason BatesStar Wars Episode I Racer isn't a bad game by any means. It's just not particularly exciting. The game has some neat surpises (just watch the introduction for an extremely slick five second video clip from the movie), but at the very core the game design is just too flat to be a ~great~ Game Boy Color racer. It'll just have to go on being ~better than average.~", "date": "May 28, 1999"}
