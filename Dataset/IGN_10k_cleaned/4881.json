{"name": "Sitting Ducks", "name_review": "Sitting Ducks", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/08/05/sitting-ducks", "text": "Sitting Ducks is a syndicated, CG-animated cartoon that's spun off from a clever painting by Michael Bedard from more than thirty years ago, titled, what else, ~Sitting Duck.~ Michael expanded his world of the Sitting Ducks in later artwork, which was then expanded further in the computer-animated series. After more than three decades after the origin's debut, we're getting the world of Sitting Ducks in a dry and uncreative Game Boy Advance game. Oh, it looks and sounds like a solid GBA title, but the actual game design -- a series of ~fetch quests~-- is incredibly redundant, bland, repetitive...just no fun at all. Features Three playable characters Adventure and racing modes 20 levels Password save Sitting Ducks is, basically, one incredibly boring game with very little to do. Nearly every level involves players wandering around the town collecting something before the time runs out. The intention is, apparently, to challenge gamers into collecting as many of the coins as possible to keep the clock running, but since the level designers lay out a path of coins from start to finish, it's more of a ~do it~ task than a ~see if you can do it~ challenge. Oh, the designers try and throw in a few hitches with manholes to accidentally fall through, or traffic to run into. Difficult, not really. Outright tedious? Absolutely. The variety comes from the different playable characters, but the action never seems to change when the player's controlling a duck or the enormous alligator: collect coins, keys, and other objects. Wash, rinse, repeat.  In an attempt to hide the tedium, the designers throw in a scooter race option in each of the game's levels. These challenges are clearly thrown in, because the vehicle controls are awkward due to the few frames of animation given to their rotation, and the quirky behavior of the opponents' AI routines. And without any link cable support in Sitting Ducks, these races become just as unexciting as the game's adventure mode.  The Game Boy Advance version of Sitting Ducks was handled by LSP in Europe. The studio has put together some decent GBA product in the past (most recently CT Special Forces 2: Back in the Trenches), but the studio must have put its ~B~ team on Sitting Ducks because this handheld game doesn't give us quite the same quality of gaming as what they've given us in portable product before. The game looks competent with better than average art and animation that's based on the CG cartoon, though the game definitely lacks any graphical flair. The music and sounds, also based on the 'toon, aren't nearly as charming to hear as the graphics are to see.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but games are supposed to be fun, right? To give you some enjoyment out of ~playing~ the game. That never seems to happen in Sitting Ducks.  Of all the things you have to collect in this game, what the designers really needed was a ~fun~ power-up. I definitely don't think this is what Michael Bedard had in mind for his characters when he first created the ~Sitting Duck~ portrait those many years ago.", "date": "Aug 5, 2004"}
