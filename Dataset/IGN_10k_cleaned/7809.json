Seems like a new hybrid is coming into its own-the combination FPS and RTS game. Machines is just such a game-with one important difference. Where games like Rainbow Six and Battlezone added RTS elements to a FPS, Machines takes the opposite approach, relying more heavily on the conventional RTS aspects of play and trying to integrate FPS ideas. The result is a pretty remarkable game about two computers fighting a war with machines.  Seems mankind finally got their act together in the 21st century. No more war, no more disease. We had it made. The only problem was overcrowding. War and disease do tend to drive down housing prices, don't they? Colonization of other planets seemed like the only solution. An FTL drive was invented, but FTL travel was fatal to cell-based organisms. Only machines could survive. It was decided to send machines on ahead to begin the process of terraforming new planets. Humans would follow later in special cryogenic, sleeper ships.  Each pod of machines was led by a Controller Unit. Since many pods were required for the terraforming of each planet a deferral system was created. Whenever two controllers have contradictory plans, the controller who has been on the planet longer is dominant. Time passes and mankind doesn't show up-no call, no letter, nothing! The machines continue to cultivate the planets until all the resources are used up.  On Eden 4, the Controller finished terraforming the planet. Since its directive forces it to seek out new land to cultivate, it begins to reach out to other planets to colonize. Five hundred years later, the pods of Eden 4 run into pods of another Controller from the planet Midian. Each Controller insisted on its own authority, accusing the other one of faulty logic. Eden 4 decided the best course of action was to create machines that would destroy the machines of the Midian Controller.  The war has raged for over 500 years now. You are a newly created, semi-autonomous AI subprocess. The faultless Controller on Eden 4 is banking everything on a last ditch offensive against the faulty Midian Controller itself. It's your job to lead it.  This game has the best view options I've seen in a while. There are three camera modes. The Zenith view is the one we're already familiar with. It's top down sort of at an angle. Since the whole world is rendered in 3D, you can also spin this view around and look at things from different angles. You can also zoom in and out, but not much. Being able to rotate the camera is a little confusing but it often adds a kind of strategic inspiration to see things from a new perspective.  You can also switch to a free floating camera that sits a few feet off the ground. This really puts you in the thick of the action. It was a little hard to control at first, but soon I was conducting whole battles from this unique perspective. In fact, by the time I got around to picking my screenshots for this review, they were almost exclusively from this camera. The camera is fully controllable and can be placed almost anywhere and even pitch up or down about 20 degrees.  The 1st person option is not hugely practical but it's definitely a ton of fun. Here you can jump into any one of your machines and control them from the cockpit. While this was immensely fun you have no control over any of your other units while in this view! Neither can you see them on the map. You do get a small, short ranged radar, but it's not enough really. 1st person view is really only best used when you know you won't be called upon to move large masses of troops in the near future.  Controls for the machines are basic. You can really only move and shoot. There are some specialized commands, but you'll rarely use them. You control the machine with the arrow keys and use the mouse to aim and fire. Some machines have independent turret facing too. It's so great to get down on the ground level and see everything from a new perspective. Plus, I think it's important to get out every now and then and walk amongst the troops. It shows that you're democratic.  The controls in the other modes are pretty standard. Simply point and click on the units to select them. Then you use the control panel to issue orders. You get about two dozen commands altogether so there is some flexibility and complexity to the game. Coolest of all of the special moves are the Treachery command, which allows you to gain permanent control over any enemy unit, and the Recycle command that allows to scrap outdated models and recover some of the costs of production. You can also set the autonomy level of each of your machines.  So...how do you win? There are three big points-buildings, troops and research.  The first thing you need is a steady supply of Building Material Units (BMUs). It's not apparent from the name, but these BMUs are used to build soldiers too. You mine resources from the surrounding territory. Before you can do that, you'll have to build a special Locator unit to find a suitable area. Once you find a stockpile, build a mine and a few transporters. Oh wait, then you've got to have a smelter to turn the raw materials into BMUs.  Other buildings are pretty straightforward. You have Factories and Labs (both civil and military versions of each). There are Radars and Turrets and such also. The most important structure is your Seeding Pod. This building houses the up-link connection to the Controller. Without it, you're lost. It also acts as a back up mine and smelter.   Once you have a steady supply of BMUs and a few factories, you're ready to construct your army. There are over 50 units in this game. Military machines come in several types and each type has four or five subtypes. You have your basic Grunts and Reapers, the building blocks of the army. The only difference here is one is strong and the other is fast. Heavy Assault units and Knights come next. Basically these two units are like the Grunts and the Reapers, just more powerful versions. Wasps are the standard flying units-from small interceptors to hulking bombers.  The best of the military units are the Commanders. They all have high firepower, excellent durability and unique weapons. The first few are not so impressive, but they're still head and shoulders above anything else you've got. As you discover more and more types, you will begin to dream of an all Commander army. Too bad they're so damn expensive. I wouldn't suggest that you neglect them, however. After all, the Midian controller has them too.  The civilian personnel are less impressive, but certainly no less necessary to your effort. I've already mentioned the Locators. Constructors are used to, get this, construct buildings. You also get spies. They are good for only two things. They can steal technology from your enemy or they can lay minefields. If your interested in going after your own research, make a few Technicians and put them to work in a Lab. You'll also need transporters, one of which deserves special mention. The Scavenger transport allows you to pick up debris around the battlefields and convert them directly to BMUs. In a long war, these guys are indispensable.  I would like to note that the designs for the accurate Eden 4 Controller and the faulty Midian Controller are exactly alike. Now, I don't want to get into a big thing about it, but, don't you think that after 1000 years of independent development and evolution, that these two guys might have come up with different designs? Whether it makes sense or not, it detracts from the game. A little variety would do a lot here. Still, there are over 50 units...hmmm, maybe I'll just shut my mouth and be glad there's as much variety here as there is.  The third area of the game is research. It is the way to win this game. You have two separate research areas-civilian and military. Civilian research is pretty linear and seems unimportant. It does contain all the advances for building a strong manufacturing infrastructure, however, so you can't neglect it. Otherwise, you'll have all these great war machine designs and no factories to build them. You simply can't ignore the more peaceful avenues of research.  Even so, this game is about beating the crap out of that faulty Midian Controller and military tech is where it's at. The technology here is split into two branches based on weapon types. The Light (or laser) Path develops pulse guns, plasma cannons and stuff like that. The Metal (or projectile) Path focuses on more conventional, kinetic guns. The bottom line is that, early on, Light has range while Metal has strength. Eventually this trend reverses itself. The Light Path has heavy, short-range weapons and the Metal Path has long range cannons.  The real debate here is whether you race toward the end of one path or pick and choose from each. Sticking to one path means you get the boss weapons sooner but less flexibility during the middle stages of the game. A lot depends on what the faulty Midian Controller is developing also.  The campaign is, unfortunately, given only from the Eden 4 side. There is no separate Midian campaign. You do get 20 linear missions spread across a few planetary environments. There is also a Skirmish mode where you can design your own battles against the computer. You don't have complete flexibility here, but there are several options. The Gaming Zone has a multiplayer Internet server but you can set up your own games over your modem.  So I'm sold on the different views in the game. That alone makes it stand out enough to be noticed. In addition to that however, Machines is a pretty solid strategy game. The integration of 1st person view could've been smoother, but you gotta cut 'em some slack for the idea alone. The lack of unique units and technologies for each side in the war is a shame, but the 50+ units and 25+ technologies mean that you will see some differences between the armies.  Long live the Controller!  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Apr 16, 1999"}
