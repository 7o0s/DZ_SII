{"name": "Clue SFX", "name_review": "Clue", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/02/clue", "text": "Professor Plum. Colonel Mustard. The candlestick. the library. These are all phrases part of the national vernacular, thanks to the original board game ~Clue.~ And now IFone has brought the classic game to mobile via a very capable, very competent translation that will entertain fans of the clever board game.   The game doesn't deviate too much from the source material. Players choose an identity from amongst the party guests present on that unfortunate night and then must roll the dice so they can set out in the mansion and snoop for clues. When you roll a high enough total to enter a new room, you can investigate for yourself and discover the current state of things, or speak to whomever else is in the room.   Talking to the other characters yields a lot of useful information that Clue mercifully keeps track of for you in a notebook. Players can tell you rumors they've heard about what happened that night, who was with who, and their own personal alibi. You have to compare these to the utterings of other character to determine who is lying.   After you assemble a rock solid case, you can go for the accusation. It happens just like in the original, with you choosing who did what with what and where. Professor Plum... did it in the study... with the lead pipe! If you were correct, the accused confesses and you leave the party feeling superbly smug. Or, in this case, you close your phone feeling smug.   Clue is a dead-on representation of the original. The board looks spot-on, with almost what appear to be scans of the art for the different rooms. The characters also feature lively art, although everybody has only a static portrait. The menus aren't exactly brimming with activity, but the simple black text on a white screen does make it easy to navigate around.  If you're something of a fan of the classic board game, IFone's Clue is a good download. You will miss seeing the faces of other players -- always a pertinent strategy while playing in the meatspace -- but the game offers up a lot of information to help you make an informed accusation if you do your homework. The board looks like it should, the character art is nice (if not stagnant), and accessing information is simple. While hardly revolutionary, Clue is still a good time.", "date": "Sep 2, 2005"}
