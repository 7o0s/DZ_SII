It seems like every other title released on the DS lately involves passively observing some animal or creature, skimping on gameplay with the assumption that the animal's personality will make the experience worthwhile. Majesco's Fish Tycoon is a game that succeeds as a virtual aquarium but fails at pretty much everything else.    As its intro explains, the game occurs on the mysterious island of Isola, where seven magic fish have gone missing, resulting in the land becoming desolate and empty. The player must locate all seven fish in order to restore Isola to its former glory. Then begins the actual game, which seems to have nothing to do with any of that. The player begins with a fish tank, some pocket change and a couple of young fish that must be grown and bred in order to earn money for more fish and accessories. Every so often a magical fish is hatched, bringing the player 1/7th closer to completing the game's overarching objective. Most of the game revolves around feeding and watching the fish, transferring them between tanks, buying accessories and pricing them for customers.    The game's biggest problem is that for such a casual idea, the gameplay mechanics are overly-complicated. Selling a fish requires catching it with the stylus, dragging it to the temporary tanks, clicking Menu, clicking Species, setting the price, exiting the menu, selecting the Sale Tank, releasing the fish, then accessing the Fish Store. Actually selling fish is incredibly boring, presumably like working at a real pet store. It involves sitting in the pet store for long periods of time, waiting for customers to drop in and purchase the available fish. There's nothing to do here but watch terribly-animated customers stumble around with their terrible AI. The player has camera control in this mode, although nothing can be done with it other than scanning around the store and panning up to the ceiling lights for no particular reason. The top screen displays info on one customer at a time, indicating which fish they liked and which they didn't. But this doesn't seem to relate too directly to sales, since a dozen customers can walk in and like a fish without any of them actually buying it.    In order to move fish on the market, the player must set a price for each species. This is where the game's shallow pool of strategy comes in. Setting the price too low means easy sales but low income, and setting it too high means potentially great income but less frequent sales. Like everything else in this game, pricing a fish is a confusing and lengthy process. First the player must capture it and put it in the temporary tank, then select the Menu and Species options to access a calculator. It would have been better to price all fish at once while in the main tank; I don't see real pet shop owners taking a gold fish out and dropping it into a separate tank every time a customer asks how much it costs. Setting the price is also pretty unintuitive. As the player hits numbers, they add to the current price instead of setting a new one. So like an annoying TV remote, the player must cancel the previous price by either backspacing or hitting the number zero twice first.   There's a contrast between the 3D fish and the 2D customers. Fish are bred by depositing two same-species fish in the temporary tank, waiting for the ~kissing sound~ and then releasing them. However, once this is done it takes ages for the ~pregnant~ fish to give birth, and there's really not much to do in this game other than breed, wait, sell and wait. Adding to the wait is the fact that it also takes ages for fish to mature to breeding age; before that, they're pretty useless.    The player can speed things through the Options menu, but even at the top speed the game moves at a sea snail's pace. According to the game, fish will mature and give birth in between play sessions. It's obvious that the developers designed this game to be played in bite-sized chunks over a long period of time, but there isn't enough game here to warrant playing it for more than a day or two. If the game had been a bit faster-paced, so that most or all species of fish could be bred in a few hours, it might have been a fun experience. But no kid is going to play this yawnfest long enough to actually find all 700+ species of fish.    Fish regularly need food and occasionally get sick, at which point the player needs to purchase some medicine and disburse it in the tank. Feeding the fish is enjoyable as they zip up to the drifting orange flakes and take turns nibbling at them. Oddly disturbing is that when fish die, either from illness or lack of care, they float dead in the tank until the player uses the stylus to drag them to a little trash can icon at the bottom of the screen. That might be a little too real for some young gamers. Stranger still, the magical fish that the game's story revolves around can also die, just like any other fish. Their discovery still counts toward the salvation of the island, but it makes no sense that they're so important yet completely expendable.    There's a trophy room where the player can look at the seven magical fish they've caught, as well as the general statistics of those fish. A Screen Saver mode rounds out the game, where the player can display their aquarium on the top screen and just observe fish swimming around to synthy music. The camera moves a bit jarringly, sometimes following a fish, sometimes focusing on nothing. It would have been nice to have some settings available to either direct the camera or zoom out so that the entire aquarium is visible at once.    Graphics are a real mixed bag. The game as a whole is pretty sparse with very little going on visually. Fish are displayed pretty small onscreen and although their AI moves them around realistically, they routinely clip through 3D objects in the tank. 2D art in the game is amateur, and effects such as bubbles look fake. The flat, billboard people that can be seen in the fish store are laughably bad, and usually animate walking in a direction other than where they're headed. Even the store owner seems to be walking behind the counter. Fonts are also terrible in this game: blurry, tiny and often anti-aliased to white when on a dark background. On the other hand, most 3D art in the game looks good with smooth edges untypical of low-poly art and detailed, realistic textures.    Music is the soothing, saxophone-led variation you'd associate with an aquatic setting. There isn't a large variety of songs, but they match the game well. There are some issues with the music cutting out during certain menu selections, and none of the tunes loop properly; there's usually a two-second gap of dead air before each song repeats. There are almost no sound effects in this game, just some bubbling and menu selection blips, although that's all that a game like this really needs.Fish Tycoon isnt bad, its just boring. The 3D fish and aquariums are well done, but the gameplay is dull, overly-complicated and everywhere outside of the tank lacks polish. The magical fish story aspect is regularly forgotten and selling a fish is probably more work than it would be in real life. Any aquarium lovers out there that just want to see fish floating around on their DS might get their twenty dollars worth out of this game. Everyone else should avoid it.", "date": "Nov 6, 2007"}
