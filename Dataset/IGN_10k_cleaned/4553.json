Fighting fans know the company well, as they have produced two classic brawler franchises that swallowed many a quarter in the last ten years: King of Fighters and Samurai Showdown. Well, thanks to developer Digital Bridges, you can save those two-bits for the overpriced laundry machines in your apartment complex. King of Fighters has come to cellphones.  Features:  Four fighters Tag-team fighting mode Unleash ~supers~  The fighting genre has been woefully under-represented on cellphones. Mforma gave it a go a while back with X2, a moderately engaging fisticuffs game, featuring your favorite Mavel mutants. Control issues hampered the game somewhat, but the problem is less Mforma's programming than the limitations of most handsets. Fighting games require solid joysicks and an evenly-spaced six button panel. Does your handset have either?  Regardless of the potential pitfalls, Digital bridges has done a fairly admirable job bringing King of Fighters to cellphones. Surely, nobody expects a game on par with the arcade titles -- and King of Fighters benefits from these slightly lowered expectations. What Digital bridges does to bridge the gap is include plenty of hallmarks from the series -- popular characters, special moves -- that fans will not be disappointed by this to-go portion of their cherished series.  Control is handled decently well. Here's the lay-out:  ~2~ -- jump ~8~ -- block ~4~ and ~6~ -- move left/right ~5~ -- punch  Because handsets cannot recognize multiple same-time button inputs, combos are really a moot point. (God luck trying to move in a quarter-circle, fella.) But should you manage to fill your ~super~ meter by dishing out enough of a beatdown, you can quickly punch in a button combo to unleash a spectacular attack. And each character has their own specific maneuvers, too, which look pretty cool.  You likely do not expect King of Fighters to contain the entire cast of the franchise. In lieu of quantity, developer Nuvostudios went for quality -- hiring on the four most popular fighters in the series: Terry, Mai, Athena, and Kyo. You begin the game with Athena and Kyo -- but once you beat the game with those two, you open up Mai. Beat the game with Mai, and you unlock Terry. But the game with Terry, and you get another gameplay mode -- two-on-two fighting.  Nuvostudios, however, did a very nice job on the visuals. King of Fighters is no carbon copy, but the essence is right -- the characters are instantly recognizable (to fans). The moves look good, especially the fireball attacks. There is a variety of backdrops, too, that help elevate the game above many other handset fighters. King of Fighters is almost a year old, and it has aged quite well. Better than Barnyard Bouncin', at least. Sure, there are some control issues, but now enough people have played handset games to understand the shortcomings of the platform. Nuvostudios and Digital bridges should be pleased about faithfully recreating the King of Fighters universe, and offering hardcore fans of the franchise (is there any other kind of King of Fighters fan?) a nice to-go portion of the classic series.", "date": "Mar 16, 2004"}
