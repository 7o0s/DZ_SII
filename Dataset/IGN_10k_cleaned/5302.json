Certifiable, even.   Which, of course, is the essence of his charm and the reason why millions of kids (of all ages) tune into the popular Nickelodeon cartoon every day and this week's feature film is likely to score enormous bank. THQ has enjoyed a very healthy and profitable relationship with Nick for years, and this arrangement continues into the wireless space with the latest SpongeBob-licensed cell game, based on the new movie.   Features:   Four mini-games  Three gameplay modes   This is THQ Wireless' third SpongeBob game. We truly enjoyed SpongeBob Squarepants Bowling and Darts, so it was with great interest that we picked up The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie game. And, to be perfectly honest, while it certainly has plenty of goofball charm and personality -- it lacks the replayability of those previous titles.   The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie is just too simplistic for its own good. Take the eating mini-game, for example. SpongeBob loves him some ice cream, so the porous protagonist finds himself seated at the counter of an ice cream shoppe. SpongeBob is fickle, so you must only gobble up specific kinds of ice cream, noted by a hungry thought balloon above SB's head. The problem? There are only two kinds of ice cream: sundae and banana split. The ice cream may shoot by at various speeds, but at no point is it ever remotely a challenge.   The driving mini-game fares better. You must guide the Pattywagon through a slalom-type course along the seabed. Now, this isn't the deeper racer we've ever played on handsets, but it's just a good, silly distraction as you guide SB through the ~gates~ on a race for the finish line.   The two other mini-games include a bubble popping contest starring the not-too-bright Patrick, one of the best TV sidekicks since George Costanza, and a King Triton ~shooting~ game where you must use a trident to nail watery folk as they walk through the lobby of Mr. Krabb's burger barn. Neither are bad, but they're just so simple.   This leads us to believe that The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie is really a kids game, the kind of app you keep around to entertain little ones. Even hardcore SB fans will find this game just too easy-breezy. They're far better served with Bowling and Darts.   Now, The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie certainly gets the look right. The visuals are straight out of the cartoon and feature fantastic animation. SB and Patrick are a hoot just to watch; even if you don't stick with The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie for very long, you'll at least get some smiles this way.  The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie is something of a let-down, especially after playing the pretty fun console version of the game, also released by THQ. The mini-games are just too simplistic for most gamers to enjoy for very long, even if they are monster SB fans. In fact, after playing The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie for a while, I was prompted to pick up my LG VX7000, which still has SpongeBob Squarepants Darts on it. You may even find me playing it while I stand in line Friday to see the movie.", "date": "Nov 18, 2004"}
