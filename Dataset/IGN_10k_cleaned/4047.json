We've had some classic games of our own, with the Heroes of Might and Magic and Age of Wonders games, but a man needs more variety. Massive Assault comes from another angle, with a science-fiction background and a decidedly combat-oriented focus. There are no heroes, resource management, research trees, or buildings to construct. If you want the traditional 4X strategy game, you won't find it here, but Massive Assualt has a lot to offer.   The game begins with an almost comicly long-winded backstory explaining why everyone is running around blowing each other up. It's pretty circuitous and covers drastic technological developments over the course of about 75 years. Unfortunately, it doesn't really have an effect on gameplay, and there's nothing really dramatic about the story to pull you in. But you can skip through it with the press of the key and head straight to killin.   And boy, is there a lot of killin to do. You have 5 tutorials, 24 standalone missions, 6 World War mission sets and 4 campaigns. All of these can be played in any order, and you can choose to play either side in the standalone missions, though for the most part you will be fighting against the revolutionaries. Some missions are short, almost perfunctory. Others will have you battling bitterly back and forth, with the winner determined through attrition and a little luck (more on that later).   While Massive Assault lacks customizable difficulty modes, being able to choose missions in any order softens this drawback a bit, and the luck factor means that you can play it again and possibly have a much better chance. You'll never be confused about your objectives, though, because everything is cleanly and clearly laid out in a pre-game sequence that overlays big arrows and zooms in on where you need to go or what location you need to defend. If you forget what you need to do, the Mission Briefing is accessible at any time.   Ya see, each map is divided into territories identified by color-coded dotted lines. At the center of this territory is a single building that produces units and acts as headquarters. You'll usually have 6-12 of these territories in each mission, and some of them will start out as yours, a few other as the enemy's, but most of them are neutral. The point is that there is some randomization. You might find yourself in the center, facing off against two adjacent enemy territories (good luck), or protected by landmasses.   While this randomization makes for some appreciable replayability, it comes at the cost of preventing full use of player skill. Some might find this ~game of chance~ aspect strategically interesting, but more often than not, you just want to play and have a good chance every time.   Unfortunately, good chances are hard to come by. You'll almost always start out either outnumbered or fighting on multiple fronts with barely enough troops and resources to go around. This combat style creates a subtle and long learning curve that you might never get right, because although the tutorials show you how to play the game, they don't show you how to play the game well. A tip here and there would have been helpful. Since this is hex-based gaming, unit stats can be underestimated...    For a while, I didn't use the basic, cheap unit because it was slow and weakly armed. However, it has good armor. Plus, the hex style means you can block units, even though you can't do much damage. Most of the units can't fire more than one or two hexes away, so you can create a wall of cannon fodder relatively easy. But the game doesn't mention any of this, nor does it talk about how you can't occupy the hex of a destroyed enemy until the next round.   There are other details, like how you can't use a unit until after the round in which you deployed it, and how an enemy in many situations won't produce a second wave of units until you've crossed into its territory, at which time it will surround you ambush-style. When a game has no resource management, research, or construction, you don't want to go digging through the manual to unearth nuggets of wisdom.    You'll need every nugget you can get, too, because the enemy never makes mistakes. In fact, usually the best way to fight is to follow its lead. While this is educational, there shouldn't be such a narrow path towards success, complicated by the randomization. Consider yourself lucky if you beat a mission the first time through.   To the game's credit, there is a lot of strategic variety, with 26 units to choose from. Your headquarters will produce a small amount of money each round, and you can spend it right away or let it accrue. The flow is not indefinite, however, so you must choose wisely. Each unit is graded on armor, damage, range of fire and range of movement, so you'll need a specific mix of vehicles for both offense and defense. There are no foot soldiers in this game, but you do have transporters that can move a few small vehicles pretty far.   But since the transporters have no weapons of their own and have little armor, and you can't deploy a unit and attack in the same round, it's not an incredibly useful vehicle. You can also build gun towers which have long range and lots of armor. Some units can fire over others across several hexes, but most of them can only attack immediately adjacent spots, which makes for a very chess-like battlefield. Yet with so many units available, it makes it that much more difficult to divine a successful combination of units for that map. Perhaps if your pool of units was limited for each map, things would be easier.   There's also a lot of graphical variety. You'll get a surprising amount of performance flexibility considering this isn't a triple-A title. You can adjust texture quality, shadows, shader effects, gamma, and even customize monitor refresh rate. Massive Assault also scales up to 1600x1200, or you can play it in a window. This is good when you have an LCD monitor with a native refresh above your computer's performance for that game, but you don't want to deal with the ugly dithering effects of non-native resolutions. Massive Assault looks pretty nice when you have everything cranked up. Sound was pretty average, and the music was stirring but a little repetitive.   Massive Assault is more frustrating than challenging and could have greatly benefited from adjustable difficulty levels. Taking away the research, resource and construction management makes the game a lot more accessible for people who want to get straight to combat, but it makes the negatives in the combat experience that much more glaring. It's a visually pleasing game that has the tweakability to scale down to relatively slow computers, but you'll need a large block of time to figure out the subtleties of the battlefield and the unit combination for particular environments and situations. However, hotseat and other multiplayer should make the game much less aggravating.", "date": "Oct 21, 2003"}
