{"name": "Kaze no Klonoa: Moonlight Museum", "name_review": "Klonoa: Moonlight Museum (Import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/04/14/klonoa-moonlight-museum-import", "text": "Despite the WonderSwan's incredible Japanese following and blockbusting sales figures, the selection of quality titles is actually pretty lame. Apart from the slightly enjoyable puzzler GunPey and an above-average port of Densha de Go! 2, no single game stands out as a true ~killer app~ for Bandai's dirt-cheap, black-and-white handheld. But when I spotted Klonoa: Moonlight Museum on the shelf, I assumed that Namco had pulled out all the stops to produce a top-notch platformer  but is it a brilliant port, or a quick rush-job?  At its heart, Klonoa: Moonlight Museum is a scaled-down version of the Playstation's Klonoa: Gateway to Phantomile -- a game that combined above-average 2D platforming with seamless 3D backdrops. Obviously, the third dimension has gotten the boot in the translation to the WonderSwan, and the game is forced to rely on the raw quality of the platforming as opposed to audiovisual trickery.  You play Klonoa, a freakish squirrel-hamster-gerbil-hedgehog hybrid with an annoyingly cutesy voice. Klonoa's job is to pound his way through a series of ~Visions~ (don't call them levels!), hopping and bopping baddies to his heart's content. The game's gimmick is that Kolonoa himself can't jump worth a darn, and has to bounce off objects to reach higher ground. After shooting enemies and picking them up, you can double-tap the jump button to ricochet off their heads. You can also chuck your enemies to the left or right, knocking down adjacent baddies like bowling pins. There are crates to stack, floating balloons to latch onto, and more moving platforms than you can shake a stick at.  Most levels are non-linear, and you're required to obtain a certain number of stars before you can open the exit door. Stars are typically blocked off by locked doors, and you'll need to acquire the X, O, Square, or Triangle keys (shades of the Playstation controller, perhaps?) before proceeding. Collecting stars isn't nearly as mind-numbing as the banana-grabbing in Digital Eclipse's Tarzan for the Game Boy Color, and you only have to snag three before gaining access to the next vision. Thankfully, all progress is saved via battery backup  no clumsy passwords here.  But is it fun? Sorta. There's more strategy involved with the bordering-on-overused crate-shuffling aspect, and most of your time is spent setting yourself up for a high jump. Level design is decent (if not a little dull) across the board. What's interesting is how the game takes advantage of the WonderSwan display  you can play the game either horizontally or vertically, and most of the levels play surprisingly well in either mode.  There are a handful of WonderSwan games that attempt to push the grayscale display to its limits, and this is not one of them. The backgrounds could use more definition, since they dissolve into a blur of mush while scrolling. Parallaxing is used to good effect, though  the foreground moves separately from the backgrounds, making things look more three-dimensional.  On the other hand, the audio content is decidedly above-average. The digitized instruments and voice samples sound good through headphones (don't even think about playing through the system's pitiful speaker), though there's only one music track per six levels  the repetition is slightly nerve-wracking.  All in all, while Klonoa plays well, it's definitely lacking a spark of originality  the whole package seems a bit blah, especially when you look at the recent installments of the Wario Land or Metal Slug series. Hopefully, some gutsy developer will take the reins with a sure-selling WonderSwan platformer -- this scaled down version of Klonoa sure isn't one of them. All that glitters is not gold, and all things Namco are not Soul Calibur. While Klonoa is one of the better titles on the WonderSwan, that's not saying much  and if Bandai is serious about taking the system to the States, the 2D platforming lineup will have to be a lot better than this.", "date": "Apr 14, 2000"}
