Simply choose one of four spaceships, pull down colored blocks from the oncoming rows and shoot them back up in order to connect four blocks of the same color. Then blow up said blocks. Along the way, you'll find steel blocks to crack. You'll find evil infection blocks that, if you don't destroy them, will infect surrounding blocks. You'll find helpful nuclear blocks and lightning blocks and rocket blocks that destroy other blocks in a variety of interesting ways. All the while, the stacks of blocks are mercilessly falling down on your little ship, attempting to crush you and your dreams. At the last possible second, unleash your special attack: a giant plasma cannon or a radioactive super-bomb. Then, level up, and do it all over again.   The fate of the entire galaxy - no, universe - is in your hands. There are two game modes: normal and survival. Normal is what you've come to know and love from puzzle games. Blow up a set number of blocks and move on to a faster, more difficult round. Thankfully, there are checkpoint rounds so you don't have to start from the beginning of the game if you die, although you always have that option. You can unlock two additional pilots to complement the opening pair of pilots. In Survival round, you blow up blocks until you can go no further and the entire game usually lasts around five minutes in total.", "date": "Apr 26, 2006"}
