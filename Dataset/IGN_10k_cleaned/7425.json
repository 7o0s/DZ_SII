We know they're coming. And finally, after the PR staffs send the review copies after the game has been on store shelves for well over a week, our suspicions are confirmed. They're crappy games, and they're here to stay. Eidos has had a decent run lately with Just Cause and the engaging Tomb Raider, but it's returned to its older ways with this stinker, Ford Bold Moves Racing. Bold Moves is a game that's so unoriginal, so boring, so incredibly sleep-inducing and so dull through and through that even Ford fans will balk at it. There is obviously nothing bold about Bold Moves, except for fact that Eidos published it at all. Even the low-budget arm of 2K Games, Goldstar, which still publishes Army Men games even after 3D0 killed the series, didn't want to publish this series anymore.   If videogames had souls, Bold Moves would be soul-less. If they had heart, it would be heart-less, and yes, if it only had a brain, it would be as dumb as a doorknob. This low-brow, generic, bottom-feeding ~racing~ game serves only one purpose: to sell for cheap in a drifting wire bin at a Wal-Mart somewhere in mid-America. Eidos presumably believes someone will want a racing game that's cheap, that is unassuming, that has a cool looking car on it, and that, well, might be good for little Johnny at Christmas. Fact is, Ford Bold Moves Racing is a cheaply made, generic piece of mediocrity with a Ford license on it. It sucks. It's a waste of time and money, and if you buy it and like it, well, may whatever lord you believe in have mercy on your soul. This is the blandest of the bland, the dreariest of the dreary, the lamest of the lame, the cheesiest of the cheese.   Don't be deceived, this great car isn't fun to drive in Bold Moves. You can tell right away Bold Moves stinks without even playing it. The manual is thin and doesn't explain the things that need explaining. The back of the box shows it stinks with awful screenshots. Even the text is hard to read. Finally, the marketing is so shameful it uses the phrase ~need for speed~ on it. EA 1, Eidos 0. I had to play this game so you wouldn't. Yes, yes, I took one for the team.    For being so bland and generic, Eidos and Empire's long-running Ford series has distinguished characteristics. The cars drive like tug boats plowing through the Le Brea Tar pits. Like a Zamboni in glue. Like a sea slug steering a John Deer tractor in slow motion on the moon in bullet time underwater through peanut butter in stop motion in reverse with the e-brake on at 1 frame per second while getting hit in the face with a frying pan while falling through the seven circles of Hell for eternity on acid while slamming jagermeister shots from a beer bong after you've barfed. If you can imagine this, then you'll know how much fun I had playing Ford Bold Moves Racing. I really did take one for the team.   The big feature in Ford Bold Moves Racing is its licensed cars. Seems like Ford doesn't give a crap about its license, but cares enough to sign off on these dullard car models, the cheaply recorded engine sounds, and the horrific handling each one offers. The cars you'll find here include: 1968 Mustang GT, 1969 Mustang Boss 302, 1970 Capri Mk I RS2600, 1970 Mustang Boss 429, 1973 Escort RS2000, 1975 Torino Sport, 1985 RS200, 1987 Sierra RS500, 1992 Escort RS Cosworth, 1995 GT90 Concept, 2000 Ford SVT Cobra R, 2002 Focus RS, 2004 Fiesta ST, 2004 Mustang GT-R Concept, 2004 SVT F-150 Lightning, 2006 Ford GT, 2006 Mustang GT, 2007 Shelby Ford GT500. There are some real lookers in there. But unfortunately, wanting to commit suicide seems like an excellent alternative to driving these Pacer-like farce-mobiles.   Dull Moves. These might very well be the exact specs and car models from real life. So why does it feel like all the cars are less attractive than real life? Aren't videogames supposed to take you way from all that with exciting virtual worlds that enable escape, fantasy, and exotica in ways you couldn't experience in real life? Perhaps, but being neither an arcade game (it's not fun enough and doesn't have enough pick-up-and-play appeal) nor a sim (simulations are about control and real-life functionality), Bold Moves finds itself deep in the heart of a treacherous fog bank of monotony.   Sure, I'm being hard. But I love racing games. Somebody has to make a pretty awful game to make me feel sick to my stomach. I used all my will to turn this review in late, and I was just on the brink of lighting them all in a bonfire. If it weren't for this Puritan ethic residing in my guts, I would have sacrificed ~Bold Moves~ to the videogame gods.    If the list of cars remains attractive to you and the price is still alluring, let me give you some other reasonable explanations behind my dislike of Eidos' latest dud. The artificial intelligence cheats. You'll watch the exact same car you're driving pull around a turn without skidding or sliding, without slowing down. Then you'll watch in amazement as it pulls away. After 10 minutes with this game, you'll realize your car isn't capable of those things. You'll watch as the AI consecutively comes in the same place each race so that, while in a championship, you'll almost always have to start over. You'll experience an incredibly dumb championship scoring system. Championships usually work by racers accumulating points over a series of races and by winning with the highest point total. You earn a certain amount of points per placement, like 10 points for first place, eight for second place, etc., and win by earning the highest score. Thus, even if you get a second or third place in one race, you'll have a chance to make it up by attaining first in the next race. Not so in Bold Moves. Here, if you lose one race you drop a ranking, you'll get silver or bronze, rendering the point system worthless. Why give points if they don't actually function?    Bold Moves didn't only steal EA's racing game name, it thieved its NASCAR team moves too. You'll have the chance to swap team mates, block and draft. These techniques work adequately. But you won't actually need them. What's more, what's the use of drafting if your team mate isn't even in a good enough position to draft from? Why can't you drift from any other car in the race? That makes more sense. Finally, the game offers an empty single-player set-up. Win single-race games, solo or team championships and have a sleepy good time in the process. Sleep! Sleep! I am Ford Racing Bold Moves -- you are under my spell! Leave this terrestrial world and enter into the land of Morpheus!   There is no online gameplay, by the way, though I seriously doubt you'd actually want to play this with anyone else. You can, however, play with another person in multiplayer. It might be the single most spectacularly boring moment of your life, but you can play two-player games. Still, by owning this game and showing it to your friends, it's like admitting you married a bearded dwarf with five nipples. Not a boasting matter. Finally, if you were a graphics tart, the bland car textures, dreary backgrounds, and unimaginative tracks will quickly douse your fire. This game, whether it's on the PC, PlayStation 2, or Xbox, is as insipid looking as they come.Yes, yes, I am being incredibly hard on this mediocre game. But it's worthless, and Eidos knows it. The game design is so transparent, the goal behind the game is so obvious, the lack of any morsel of fun is so far from the car and tracks and the playing of itit's just exasperating. This is pure bargain bin trash. Don't get it. Don't rent it. Don't even think about it.", "date": "Oct 24, 2006"}
