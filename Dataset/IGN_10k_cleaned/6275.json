Unlike football and baseball, which is played out in quick bursts, basketball is a game of constant motion. Players pound the boards between baskets and rebounds, swatting away shots and attempting fast breaks. To try and squeeze ten tiny dudes on the already suffocated real estate of a mobile screen and you often have a recipe for difficult and ultimately unsatisfying game play. Such is the case with THQ Wireless' NBA Basketball 2006, which does several things right, but is undercut by reaching beyond what the current gen of handsets is capable of.   NBA Basketball 2006 makes a solid stab at real five-on-five game play, leaving the arcade experience to games like THQ Wireless' own NBA Slam. It employs a full NBA license, which does help translate the emotional attachment viewers develop with the favorite teams to the smallest screen. The game has a roster update feature that keeps teams fresh and accurate, and an on-screen ticker reveals the performance stats of each team.   It offers several play modes, such as the Quick Game option that randomly chooses two teams for you. Playoffs mode is for basketball fans that don't pay attention until April, letting them take their team from the first round of the playoffs to (they hope) the finals. Missing is a Season mode, but considering that I can count the number of mobile sports game with season modes that I willingly played through the entirety of said season on the one hand of shop teacher.   The action is viewed from a north-south perspective, which is something I grew to dislike the more I played. It does give the appearance of 3D, but when players crowd into the paint, the action can become difficult to follow. This happens partly because the player models are so large -- which would normally be a benefit, but in this case, the cluster of sprites can get too unwieldy. The game attempts to make sense of the mess by labeling active players, but even those seem to add to the confusion. (I did like the ~fast break~ icon that appears if one of your players bounds up the court with the ball, but it is necessitated by the under-the-basket madness that blocks the view.) There is no option to switch the camera to an east-west view.   NBA Basketball 2006 does employ a nicely simplified control scheme, which I did enjoy. The majority of action is handled with the thumbpad, and the inclusion of some hold buttons to keep your player moving in the same direction is useful. This keeps you from laying on the thumbpad for the entire length of the court. Action are assigned to the ~OK~ key. If you are on offense, tapping ~OK~ passes the ball to an open player while holding it shoots the ball. On D, holding the button switches players and tapping initiates a steal. You can juke from time to time, noted by a ~Juke~ icon above your player's head. You juke by pressing the thumbpad to the left or right quickly.   If there was a little more space on the screen (granted by ditching a couple players) to follow the action, I think I would have enjoyed NBA Basketball 2006 much more. The control scheme works well for an arcade-style game, but the on-screen glut of sprites makes it difficult to use the clever scheme to its full potential.   There is a lot happening under the hood in NBA Basketball 2006. The game does use some nifty tricks -- for example, if you have the ball, the longer you hold on to it the more likely you will lose it. It's better to keep passing the ball than sit on it and risk the steal. You can also pick to get around accomplished defenders. But again, it's hard to appreciate all of this.   NBA Basketball 2006 puts up a solid broadcast-style HUD over the action. The score is easy to read in the upper-right corner and the name of the active player is displayed on the bottom with his team logo. You will also see player statistics next to the name during play. Use these to keep tabs on your best players and try to feed them the ball as much as possible.  NBA Basketball 2006 is an interesting effort, as it wants to be more than is seemingly possible on most handsets. I like that THQ wanted big player sprites and to anchor the camera behind the basket so the action beneath it looked as larger-than-life as it does if you ever do get a chance to sit under the basket in real life. But when the screen is crowded with no fewer than ten dudes, things get a little difficult to follow. You lose track of defenders in the heat of the moment, for example.I must make another mention of the simple control scheme. It's a winner and I hope THQ uses it in a 2007 edition of the game. But I also hope that they either scale back the number or size of the players. I appreciate the desire for five-on-five realism, but the NBA license already helps lend the game authenticity.", "date": "Nov 4, 2005"}
