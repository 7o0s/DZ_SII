With play-calling, strategy, and fast decision-making important to a successful footballer, is any handset up to the challenege?  Is Sorrent?  Features: Hot football action Play offense and defense First-person view Play against human opponents! 38 offensive plays, 5 defense sets  FOX Sports Football is best described as an entirely competent, able alternative for footbal nuts that can't manage to take NFL2K3 or Madden with them wherever they go.  It's a welcome respite from those non-football minutes, such a corporate meetings or bathroom breaks, and allows fans to take their fave sports with them, no matter how far flung the locale.  And best of all, they can now see just how they stack up against other football freaks, thanks to Sorrent's Mobile Persona program.  Once you point your phone's browser to Sorrent's MP page, you can create an online avatar to represent you in the digital ether arena.  With each sack or touchdown, earn valuable points to max out your character.  FOX Sports Football is played, like FOX Sports Basketball, in two parts.  offesne and defense.  You start out with the ball, working your way down the field in that eternal quest for the goal line.  Al Pacino screamed about football being a game of inches, and FOX Sports Football manages to convey that sentiment with every grueling journey down the astroturf.  First, pick a play from your book, such as Slant Screen or Sweep R, and fool your competition into a boneheaded play that allows you to advance the ball.  Your receivers are assigned numbers (1-3), and as they hoof it down the field, you can see their respective numbers over their heads.  When you see the number, press it on the keypad to send the ball in their direction.  Hopefully, the D will blow it and the pass will be completed.  Now, you cannot wait forever.  Wait too long, and those numbers will be replaced by X's.  Once all three receivers are out of range or covered, you better at least hurl an incomplete pass or risk being sacked and losing precious yards.  Switch over to defense, and it's a pretty similar set up.  Pick plays from the book, then wait for your players to get into position.  Use the number pad to activate players and stop that ball.  Visually, FOX Sports Football looks decent.  While not up to Basketball's impressive standards, FOX Sports Football certainly gets it done.  (Or as some of football most fervent fans might say, ~That dog'll hunt.~)  The action on the field is a little harder to keep track of, especially when players converge onvthe same point in the field.  The animations are slightly choppy, but perhaps that's just due to the online play feature -- not unlike lag in a console game.Are you ready for some football?  Fox Sports Football is a good, rowdy distraction that should satisfy pigskin fans that simply cannot wait for Monday Night Football.  It delivers solid action, even if the rules and play are not exactly kosher.  It's the spirit of the game that Sorrent nails, which should be lauded.  As should the online play feature, which heralds the future of cellphone gaming.  These devices are already online, you know.", "date": "Jul 15, 2003"}
