First, it's called Varmint Hunter. Second, it's made out of plastic. Please, allow me a moment of your time so that I can properly elaborate as eloquently as is possible... This game freaking sucks.   Let's go over the two good parts of Varmint Hunter in a bit more detail, shall we? In this context, varmint refers to any of many undesirable critters: those pesky animals in dire need of shooting. Hunter would of course then be you: that drunken hillbilly more than happy to oblige the prior's need to catch speedily moving bullets. Now, as we all know, plastic is a compound produced by polymerization. It comes from the Greek word plastikos because of its inherent capability to be molded to form. Plastic is truly a marvelous thing. Varmint Hunter is not.  It's really quite refreshing in this day and age when so many games try so readily to needlessly clutter the screen with superficial things such as color, activity, and quality, that we can find a game like Varmint Hunter, happily forsaking all of that in favor of the drab, mundane and poorly implemented drably mundane. Obviously I'd never actually be so misguided to attempt to strike a direct and blatantly unfair comparison between Varmint Hunter and the latest in Unreal technology (as if Epic ever had a chance), but I will say that when you put nothing into a game, you're going to get nothing out.   Artistic zeal is for the weak! All I need are flat landscapes, uninspired meadows (that surprisingly come without either the mead or the ows), poor or no animation (the latter of the two being my personal favorite), crappy effects, and oft glitchy behavior. The least they could have done was make the terrible, infectious crap they did have run well. But even on a high-end Pentium 4 matched with a GeForce 3 Ti 500, the title still ran choppy. Why? What is it? The seventeen colors being thrown about bringing the engine to its knees? The big stretch of nothing that plagues every level too much of a burden to bear? No? Well maybe it's all of the entities in the game, that, when not clipping into the ground, are floating above it?  Whatever the answer may be, the result is ugly, ugly, ugly. Texture work, especially that on the ground, is horrifying. And when in first-person view, there is no animation. None. The rest is the rest, and retains the same substantially lacking amount of quality across the board -- a kind of merit vacant work that barely earns a passing mention. This is all of course assuming you can ~appreciate~ it without the plaguing bugs of blazing white lighting and the world unceremoniously clipping out from underneath you, dropping you into the endless void that is poor programming.  But graphics don't make a game, silly. The game makes a game. I know that, you know that, but nobody told Varmint Hunter that. Whee! The game sucks.  They call it hunting, but it's not. This trash is no more of an authentic representation of hunting than Oregon Trail's food gathering mini-game was thirteen years ago. After choosing one of five places to ~hunt,~ in one of four seasons, and at any time throughout the day (nighttime fog still manages to be bright), you begin your quest. Sadly, that quest involves aimlessly walking about by your lonesome until you spot a creature off in the distance and then shoot at it.  Baits, calls and scents are provided for, but ultimately serve little purpose. It's just as easy and in fact preferable that you merely scurry up and down the map looking for trouble. Don't even bother creeping up on something, though the option to do so renders you almost invisible to all of the apparently daft animals that infest the continental United States. Even though hunting necessitates waiting, patience, and slow movement, anyone who has played a lick of an FPS should have no problem tagging moving targets while running up and down the barren wastelands. They try and escape, just not very well. I was picking off frantic rabbits in one or two shots with little trouble. Just choose the gun you like (out of eight), whatever color clothes you want (out of four), any other crap, and then be sure to enjoy all that running around in big ugly circles has to offer.  Varmint Hunter plays like a third/first person shooter, and offers absolutely nothing that can be construed as actual hunting. The design amounts to point accumulation dependant on how accurate you are and from what ranges you manage to nail what targets. You'll be awarded points that all pile into the user you created at the onset of play, or you'll be deducted points if you manage to kill yourself or another human along the way.   Make no mistake, you still get to shoot plenty of animals (and even explode them with the right guns). And why not? God made guns, so therefore thou must shoot and explode his critters with them. Amazingly enough, even this simple pleasure has no allure.       Some of the animals do express behavior akin to their kind. You'll be attacked by coyotes from time to time, coyotes will chase hares, hares will hide behind bushes, and foxes have no problem swimming straight through a stream, but it's all very rudimentary and doesn't change the fact that success relies on simple and slow running and shooting.  You wouldn't think it possible, but Varmint Hunter manages to be as big of an aural disaster as it is in any other department. The game has no music, none aside from the pride-instilling, adrenaline-rushing epic western stuff in the menu system, that is. Even though no music is always better than bad music, in this case it just means you'll have to endure the sound more. Your hunter is an idiot. He's constantly repeating the same five lines and comes off as being borderline lame and definitely drunk. A couple of memorable quips are testament to that: ~Easy there, Patrick Swayze.~  ~I love the smell of varmit.~  Oh my. Any game that implies Patrick Swayze is some kind of gun toting action hero and then goes on to praise the odor of varmint is not welcome in my home.  Gunshot noises (the one thing in the game you'd figure they'd get right) are equally poor, washed out, and flat. They have the right realistic feel, but don't come off well or polished. The only satisfying bit of noise in the whole bleeding thing is when you shoot yourself in the ass, as Cletus so often warns you'll do whenever you run with gun drawn.  What did you think of Varmit Hunter?   Moving on to no multiplayer. On the bright side, I don't have to write much, and you don't have to subject your friends to any of the torment this game offers. I'm sure plenty of that already comes from the depths of your own personal hells as is. There are certain things a game must do to be an acceptable, passable game. There are certain things a hunting game must do to be an acceptable, passable hunting game. Varmint Hunter not only fails miserably at meeting any and all of the above criteria required for decency in our industry, it actually lowers the bar for everyone else. Varmint Hunter is mystically bad at everything. It's as if someone studied the foul art and then put serious effort into sucking.I would not buy it from a cat. I would not store it in a hat. I would not play it in a spire.I would not use it to douse a fire.I would not play for fear of tainting the land.I would not play to keep someone from severing my hand.Varmint Hunter should not have been.It's very creation must be a sin.Truly, I enjoy arbitrarily murdering animals with a shotgun or magnum for no damn reason just as much as the next guy does, but even my insatiable blood lust isn't a bit aroused by Varmint Hunter. The game has ZERO appeal.No hunting, no action, no fun, no good. Varmint Hunter is one of those things that archaeologists will find ten thousand years from now and use to gauge and gawk at the stupidity and zaniness of 21st century society.", "date": "Mar 5, 2002"}
