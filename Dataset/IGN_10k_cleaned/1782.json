I suppose some of you might classify yourself as indifferent but, in my opinion, that's just your excuse for not getting involved in the debate. The point is that the creak of timber, the smell of tar and the snapping of canvas elicit yawns from many gamers. But there are a lot of us out there that get all goosey over the prospect of fitting out an 80-ton converted India Merchantman and plundering shipping along the English coast. The Age of Fighting Sail is, like the American Old West, one of the most romanticized periods in our history. It's been thrown over a bit in favor of its predecessor, the Age of Piracy. Leave it TalonSoft to bring the focus back to a more military context.  Age of Sail II is a tactical naval war game set in the, well, the Age of Sail. Covering the period from the Seven Year's War through the Napoleonic Wars, it allows gamers to refight the classic naval engagements of the period, including those of the American War for Independence and the War of 1812. All of the action is run through a fantastic 3D engine, developed by Akella (also the makers of the much more pirate focused Sea Dogs). David Farragut and Horatio Nelson wannabes can command dozens of ships in literally hundreds of individual historical engagements. There are also six campaigns that offer maybe another 60 or 70 scenarios, ranging from the Battle of the Nile to the Battle off Flamborough Head. Okay that might not mean much to most of you, but ask an old salt and they'll be impressed. And when I say ~ask an old salt~ I don't mean to find some salt and ask it. Grow up.  So, maybe it's about time I got to my opinion of the game (we include those first two paragraphs of exposition to weed out the weak-minded). My overall impression of Age of Sail II is much like my impression of the original game -- it's fun and a little obtuse. But the good thing is that Age of Sail II is more fun and less studious than its predecessor. Not that the game has been dumbed down at all, but it's much more approachable. And maybe that's why I thought it was more fun. I mean, I don't mind games that require a little thought and study. Heck, I'm probably the only person here who wants to review Silent Hunter 2 or Europa Universalis.  But Age of Sail II relies on a much more straightforward interface than the earlier game. I don't love the interface necessarily and there are still some important things that it's missing, but overall I'm quite pleased with it. There are several collapsible, moveable windows so you can pretty much set up the interface the way you'd like it. Luckily a system of hotkeys keeps the interface as unobtrusive as possible. The only thing that's really missing here are hotkeys for pausing and adjusting the game speed. To activate these commands you've got to hit ESC and select pause or the new speed from a drop down menu. It's a small thing, but it makes it a little more frustrating each time you have to do it. Other than that, it's remarkably easy to set sail states, gunnery priorities and all the other piddley crap that you have deal with as captain. Sadly the crew management and fleet formation screens fill up the entire game window, so you'll be unable to stay focused on the action while adjusting your crew or formation orders.  The windows also tend to obscure the fantastic graphics in the game. The details on the ships are remarkable. Even though the game doesn't allow for the extreme close ups or low angle shots, you can still get close enough to see the planks in the deck and the seams in the sails. And the little guys running around on the decks are a big plus. And the visual damage modeling is superb. Little holes appear in hulls and sails alike. And once you've damaged an enemy enough, you might even be rewarded by seeing their masts topple over into the drink. Drink is navy talk for the ocean. The drink in this game is kind of weak and flat, especially when compared to the effects in Sea Dogs but the landmasses and sky effects are particularly nice.  Age of Sail II comes with a few campaigns depicting the war of 1812 -- one from the British side and two from the American. You can also take part in a four-mission campaign that recreates the battles of Lord Nelson. A British campaign set in the American War of Independence is a nice addition, but it's the inclusion of a Black Sea campaign that really spices things up. The conflict between the Turkish and Russian fleets is a nice change of pace. The missions can go pretty quickly if you're sharp, but don't expect to spend more than ten or fifteen minutes on any particular mission. This is due, in part, to the handy time compression feature, but also to the lack of challenge from the AI. I lost plenty of engagements to be sure, but it was almost always because I was outnumbered.  The hundred or so single scenarios allow you to jump right in to the game without having to worry about the context of the battle. Those of you who dig getting background hinkfo can find it in the form of a little introductory essay that prefaces each mission. It's not fabulous, but given the amount of battles that the team had to cover, that's hardly a serious criticism. I would have liked a little more information on the campaigns, but once again, this isn't that big of a deal. I've been more than a little confused that the game sometimes allows you to go to a fitting out screen and sometimes it doesn't.  But the game has worse faults -- not by a long shot. First and foremost, this is an unstable game. Not so much that it seriously affects your enjoyment, but bad enough as it is. Lots of gamers (including yours truly) have been having problems getting the game to run properly on Voodoo 3 cards. I realize the Voodoo 3 isn't necessarily industry standard or anything, but why should we suffer alone? There have also been some C++ runtime errors here and there but I'm not sure yet if this is connected to the 3D support problems or the fact that the short cut the game installed on my desktop doesn't work right. As an added plus, launching the game from the CD autorun causes some problems too. TalonSoft have already released a patch that smoothes things out a lot, but there's still some instability here and there. Still, if you run from the Start Menu, things run a lot better.  The next problem, which is something we pointed out in the preview, is that the fleet formation interface is...what's the word... broken? Busted? Whatever you call it, the thing doesn't work as it should. While I found that it could easily handle a half-dozen ships at a time without relying on the formation interface, once my fleets got larger than that, I was screwed. Ships sometime respond to orders and sometimes not. And occasionally the game will select multiple formations for a single group of ships. Don't ask me how they do it. And even if you can get the ships in formation, giving them movement orders isn't always as easy as it should be.  So is this a big problem? Definitely. While the small-scale actions are rewarding, the main focus of this game (and what many of us consider to be the foremost feature of the Age of Sail) is large fleet actions. Many of the scenarios require you to command up to 20 or more vessels at a time. This problem is made worse by the fact that the manual spends about two paragraphs explaining what the formation interface does but not how it's supposed to work. That can even be expanded into a criticism of the entire manual in general. I didn't expect an F-22 size manual here, but the ~book~ included with the game seems kind of scant. Where's the ship list? Where's the historical appreciation? Where are the Fighting Instructions? TalonSoft's usually pretty committed to this sort of thing so the exclusion here is doubly frustrating.  The only other thing that really bothers me is the lack of continuity within the campaigns. I mean, they all have a linear connection but the sense that you're a captain moving from one engagement to the next is really absent here. In one mission, you're captain of the Constitution, in the next you're the captain of a tiny schooner. This is progress? Other than a collection of newspaper clippings (which you can't even read) or inscribed ceremonial swords, the only thing tying the scenarios together are your prestige points. I wanted a little more of a sense of connection between the missions.  But like I said at the start (well, maybe not at the start, but it's somewhere up there), this is the only game in town as far as Fighting Sail games go. Sea Dogs is fantastic, but it's got much more of an individual piracy focus. But I don't want to make this like your grandpa tells you, ~You're my favorite grandchild,~ and then you're all like, ~But I'm your only grandchild.~ It's more than that. Age of Sail II isn't just a good game because of the dearth of competitors; it's a good game in it's own right. There are plenty of problems with it, but it still delivers a reasonably accurate simulation of the Wooden World with a little bit of fun thrown in for good measure.  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
