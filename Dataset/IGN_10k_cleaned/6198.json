We here at IGN have been playing the game almost non-stop since we got our first playable versions. The first time we laid hands on the game we felt that Firaxis was doing something special with the series. As newer, more complete builds came our way, our expectations for the game only grew. After having spent a lot of time playing through the final version, we can safely say that Civilization IV is the best version of Civilization yet.  The first thing you need to understand is that Civilization IV is a fundamental reinvention of the franchise. Fans should be assured that all the basic concepts from Civilization are still here, but many of the more obnoxious or troublesome elements have been greatly improved upon. City production, combat, and culture have all been tweaked to allow for more intuitive application within the game. Concepts like civil disorder, predictable tech paths, pollution and the creeping pace of the late game have all benefited from substantial revisions that make them more manageable and enjoyable aspects of your strategy.    On top of these revisions, Civilization IV finally offers up a presentation worthy of the gameplay. A new graphics engine adds life and charm to the world, making the experience really come alive. The interface elements have all been refined to ease access and readability. A wealth of fantastic music highlights the entire experience with a pitch-perfect voiceover assist from Leonard Nimoy.   I'm still amazed at the way information is presented in this game. While all versions of Civilization have allowed players to dig down into the numbers behind the game mechanics, Civilization IV offers such ready access to these figures that you'll get a really good sense of how the game is working. Mousing over terrain tiles tells you what the defense bonus is, the resource yield, any special resources (and the improvement needed to utilize them), as well as the ownership of the tile. What's more, it will even list all the units in the square, their strength, movement, identity and any promotions they have.  The game map also shows off a lot of information. Since there are many more types of terrain improvements this time around, you'll be able to tell just by looking at the map whether a given tile is generating food, commerce or production. There are options you can turn on to highlight certain resources. This makes it much easier to pick out where the key deposits are. Similar options let you see military units, resource yields, cultural ownership and other factors. Since there are many more terrain improvements this time around (and since you'll need to build them before you can access strategic resources or luxuries), having this information handy makes strategic planning much more convenient.  Though the new interface is wonderful, there are a few areas where more could be done. The announcements that your rivals have completed a wonder or founded a new religion should be put right in your face, not off to the side in the smallest font the game has available. While some players might find pop-ups more obnoxious, it would certainly help me stay oriented to what's going on during the game. The comprehensive Civilopedia offers all kinds of information, but there should be cross-linking for civic types and terrain improvements. While it's not a big deal while you're just browsing, it's kind of limiting when you're selecting a new technology and can't access the other entries.      The health and happiness of your cities is handled differently than in previous versions of the game. The health of a city drops as population and pollution increase. To offset the decline, you'll need to build health-producing improvements like aqueducts and hospitals. Any extra unhealthiness is basically bought off with surplus food. If you have a big food surplus (or access to health-giving resources like cows, rice, etc.) your cities will survive unhealthy conditions, but they won't grow. While we're on the subject of growth, settlers and workers don't consume population when they're built. Instead, cities will simply convert all excess food into production while settlers and workers are being built. This makes it much easier to get these units out of smaller, less prosperous towns, but it also makes it impossible to grow your population in cities that have substantial food surplus.   The changes to happiness are among the most welcome changes in the game. Rather than sending your cities into disorder, excess unhappy people simply refuse to work. This means that your cities will definitely feel the burden of unhappiness but they won't be completely shut down like they have been in previous versions of the game.  Corruption has also been tweaked a bit. Rather than reducing the proportion of resources you can use in distant cities, you'll now find that the overall maintenance cost of your empire increases based on the number of cities you control. This eliminates the aggravating problem of having large cities that are good for nothing simply because they're located far away from your capital.  In all, the emphasis seems to be on creating fewer cities but tailoring them to specific needs. So rather than focusing on your cumulative research potential, you'll tend to rely on a handful of cities to provide the majority of your research. You can establish roles for each of your cities through the production of regular buildings, but the real work will be done through the establishment of national wonders and the creation of specialists. National wonders are like small mini-wonders that increase culture, research or productivity. Since only two can be built in each city, you're forced to focus each city on a specific type of output.  Civilization IV has done away with separate attack and defend values for each unit in favor of a single power rating. While that simplifies the combat system a bit, there are plenty of other specializations that come into play that add a lot of variety to the system. Spearman, for instance, gain a substantial bonus against mounted units. Archers gain bonuses when defending hills or cities. Archers also get the First Strike power, giving them a chance to take out enemy units before they take any damage themselves. Mounted units typically have a chance to withdraw from combats if they find themselves on the losing end of the combat.  Each unit that wins a fight earns experience points that can be used to buy promotions. These run the gamut from simple power bonuses against certain types of units, or in certain types of terrain, to more sophisticated bonuses like the ability to heal nearby units or perform amphibious attacks. This system not only encourages greater specialization of your units but also makes you feel more invested in them. Believe me, you'll think twice before you send your amphibious assaulting cavalry who have a 25% bonus against melee units against an enemy's island stronghold. Still, they're the best unit for the job, so...  One of the consequences of this system of unit promotion is that it makes it harder to take cities with a handful of units. Each failed attack just gives the defenders more experience points to spend on promotions. In a strange way, the longer it takes you to capture a city, the harder it can become. The game offers up a few ways to work around this problem, however. First, the experience system rewards attackers more than defenders, so holding off an enemy won't earn you as many promotions as taking the offensive will. Artillery will also help out, not by damaging the defenders inside a city (which it can't do) but by diminishing a city's defense bonus.      Artillery can damage units outside of cities however, and, depending on the right promotions, can even hurt enemies in adjacent squares. The cool thing about catapults this time around is that they attack every single unit in a stack. This discourages players from simply putting all their units right on top of one another and maneuvering en masse. Since artillery can be so devastating to grouped units, you'll find that it makes more sense to spread your forces out.  While we're on the subject of combat, I have to admit that the game still suffers from the spearman-defeats-tank combats. I honestly don't have as big a problem with this as most other players, but it's been a controversial design decision since day one. Admittedly, the disparity between primitive and advanced units isn't quite as wide as it would be in the ~real word,~ but I'm willing to accept the abstractions used in the game. I mean, even the Ewoks were able to take out an AT-AT every once in a while. But even if you accept that a substantially weaker unit could win these combats, it just seems wrong that knights can defeat helicopters.   Culture is another feature that was sort of controversial in the previous game. This time around, it's much more refined. To begin with, the borders are much more significant now. Unless you've agreed to open your borders to a neighbor, they're not allowed to enter your cultural borders without declaring war. Rather than simply relying on city improvements to extend your borders, you can now adjust your commerce slider to build culture across your empire. Since trade is an important vehicle for the spread of a culture, this makes a lot of sense. You can also get a one-time culture boost in a city by using a Great Artist to create a great work. In addition to swaying nearby neighbors to join your empire, a city with a high culture will also be harder for a rival to take by force.  Though culture and religion are tied closely together, religion is a separate concept in Civilization. Sidestepping any possible controversy, all seven religions in Civilization IV are completely interchangeable. You won't, for instance, find that one religion is more tolerant or puts a higher priority on missionary activity than any others. The missionaries, temples and holy cities of each religion are going to function exactly the same; only the names are different.  Since there are seven religions in the game, it's relatively easy for players to found one. Owning a holy city and having a state religion can make a big difference in your strategy. Trying to spread the religion around the world is particularly challenging, but well worth it if you can actually sway an entire empire to adopt your religion.  Though the spread of religion can boost the information and income you get, its real value lies in your ability to take advantage of certain civic options and city improvements. Certain civic options will give you bonuses for having a single state religion -- either by giving new units extra experience points or by giving you a bonus to production. Cities with a religious affiliation have access to a variety of buildings (temples, monasteries, etc.) that can boost that city's happiness, culture or research.  Religion also plays a big role in your relations with other civs. Each civilization remembers your past actions and will react to you based on (among other things) whether or not you've refused to help them in the past, are currently trading with their enemies, or have closed your borders to them. But in the face of all these adjustments, the single biggest gripe a rival will hold against you is that you've fallen under the sway of a ~heathen religion.~      You gain access to new religions and new civics by researching the appropriate technology. Fans of the previous games will find that the technology tree is much more open-ended here. The 80 or so techs that you can research are still arrayed in a vast tree with certain key technologies opening up new research paths but, unlike the previous games, there are some soft pre-requisites here. Instead of getting all the techs that lead to a given advance, you can sometimes make do with just getting one of the technologies that leads to the advance you want. This new approach means that technology is much more fluid here.  There are still some basic lines of research for civs focused on military or commercial advancement -- warmongers are still going to want to get Iron Working, Military Tradition, Gunpowder and so forth -- but there's much more variety this time around about how you reach each of those goals and what you stop to pick up along the way. Since there's so much more room for selection, you'll find that trading technologies with your neighbors is a much more lucrative business. Even civs that fall far behind others are going to have a few technologies that more advanced civs have overlooked.   New technologies also give you access to the components of government, Civics. Civics are spread across five areas: government, religion, labor, law and economy. Each area has five separate civic options associated with it, and you're free to pick and choose from among them to create your own style of government. In general, you'll find that the later civic options are the ones to stick with for maximum efficiency, but there are compelling reasons for warmongers and theocrats to stick with more ~primitive~ civics because of the bonuses they offer. You may, for instance, stick with Vassalage and Theocracy for the extra experience it gives your new units. You could add in Police State for the extra military production and the decrease in war weariness. If you're going more for research, you might take Mercantilism and Caste System for the extra specialists you get and then throw in Representation for the research boost you get from all specialists.  There are a number of different ways to play the game, and the winning conditions are pretty much the same this time around, as they were in the previous versions.  Domination and elimination are unchanged. Just grab enough of the world or take out everyone you see and you'll have earned your place in history. Civilization IV's culture victory moves past the single city requirement of the previous game and now requires you to build up three cities to a legendary culture level.  The space race merely requires you to construct the pieces needed for the ship. Once it's complete, you're declared the winner. I kind of miss the old system of requiring you to wait until the ship reached Alpha Centauri. That mad rush that other civs made to take your capital was always a great part of the game.  The diplomatic victory works pretty much the same as well but the UN is a much more potent force this time around. Once the Wonder is built, elections are held to determine who gets to be Secretary General. The Secretary General then gets the chance to propose new resolutions each turn. These resolutions would open up new trade, ban nuclear units, or force all the civs in the game to adopt certain civic options. If enough civs vote in favor of the proposal, it becomes a global rule. The final proposal basically asks the other civs to vote you a diplomatic victory. Assuming you've made some close friends among the larger civs, you should have it sewn up.  Even so, winning isn't easy. The AI presents a wide range of challenges, depending on your difficulty level. Regardless of whether you're a Chieftain or an Emperor, you'll notice that each AI comes with its own strengths. Some will be better at building Wonders, others will get free promotions for new units. The personality of each AI comes into play as well. Some will be predisposed towards certain types of governments and may even start to strong arm you to come around to their way of thinking. The AI is much more active in terms of making trades this time around, as well, and will frequently offer up exchanges all on their own.      There are lots of different difficulty levels in this game. At a basic level, the higher difficultly levels tend to give discounts for research and production to your rivals. But there are other factors at work here, too. You'll find that higher difficulty levels lower the ~freebies~ you get in terms of unit support and the health and happiness of your cities.  Previous versions of Civilization haven't been ideally suited to online play. The turn-based format and the slow pace of the late game make for lots of down time. Happily, Civilization IV retains the simultaneous turn-based format of Play the World. You'll still find yourself waiting for your friends to move all their units every now and then, but you'll still be able to tinker with your cities while they're putting the final touches on their turns. If you opt to play on the smaller worlds with accelerated research and production, you can easily run through a complete game in less than three hours. Playing on a larger world without the speed boost is going to take considerably longer.   The front-end interface for the multiplayer games is relatively convenient, but I'd still love to see an option to save my username and password so I don't have to enter it every single time I want to play. In any case, creating, finding and joining a game is just about as easy as it could be here, and the GameSpy technology seems reliable enough.   I've been having router problems lately that have bumped me out of some multiplayer games. Lucky for me, when this happens in Civilization IV, the game informs the rest of the players that I've dropped and prompts them to wait for me to rejoin or to let an AI opponent take over my empire. You can even save a multiplayer game and jump back into it later. Dan and I already have about four games that we still need to finish. (To keep players from getting a look at your empire during a break, you can password protect your civilization so that only you can take charge of them when the game loads.)  Previous versions of Civilization have thrived despite having relatively unexciting graphics. While the visuals were always clear enough to serve the action, they hardly could have stood on their own. Happily, that's not the case with Civilization IV. The game's move to 3D allows the artists to include visuals that match the appeal of the gameplay. The new engine allows for lots of life and animation on the game map.   From elephants walking around in their terrain tiles to spearmen jabbing at lions and wolves, the animations are fantastic. You'll see plenty of unique combat animations as you play through the game. The graphics also give you a good sense of what's going on. Blue glows announce available unit promotions, black and yellow clouds show a lack of health in a city, and fire and smoke show disorder in a city. Most units are composed of three models. As they get damaged, they'll go down to two and then one before they're finally destroyed. Being able to read the map at a glance like this really keeps you up to speed on what's going on.  I still like the Wonder movies from the second game more than the ones here. The ones from Civ 2 used footage of the real world Wonders; here they just show a CG model of the building in question. While it's a nice touch, it just feels a little boring.  Though the individual unit sounds in the game are pretty good, the music really steals the show. From the opening choral piece to the subtle nation-specific diplomacy music, the entire score of the game lends a strong sense of culture and feeling to the game. The orchestral music from Bach, Beethoven, Brahms and company is very well chosen and supports the action very well.  Finally, hats off to Leonard Nimoy for his amazing voiceover work reading a short quotation as each new technology is discovered. The quotations are well chosen and really help to connect the progress you're making in the game to our own history. Leonard Nimoy's readings are so good with these quotations that we wish he'd been used for every other aspect of the game.The original Civilization is among the most enjoyable, influential games of all time.  Its sequels have sought to build upon the basic model by adding greater levels of complexity and streamlining the interface. And though the sequels were definitely great games, they were still rooted in an interface and gameplay style that had changed very little since the original was released in 1991.That's not the case with Civilization IV. It reenergizes the core concepts of the series, staying faithful to what fans expect while also creating a wholly original game. While the game hasn't lost any depth or detail, every aspect of the design has been streamlined to make it easier for new players to jump in and less monotonous for veterans. Die-hard fans will definitely find that the game offers up so much more variety this time around. The shape of each game is quite different, from the ways you build up your empire to the ways you tear down the empires of others.Sadly, even the most comprehensive reviews of Civilization IV can't discuss every aspect of the game. There's just so much to experience in this game that you can't possibly hope to cover every topic. While I'd love to tell you all about the other joys and secrets here, Dan and I have to go and teach the Greeks a lesson.", "date": "Oct 21, 2005"}
