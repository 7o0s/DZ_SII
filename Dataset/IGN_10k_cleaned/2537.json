Despite our repeated assertions that the massively multiplayer market has sprung forth in full flower over the last few years, it's important to realize that these games have their roots in the MUDs and online flight sims of the late eighties and early nineties. Titles like WarBirds, AirWarrior and Fighter Ace presaged the upsurge and popularity of the massively multiplayer online market that exists today.  And now, the team at VR1 has updated their title, Fighter Ace, with a third iteration. Fighter Ace III, although finished, is not yet available in stores. Instead, the team at VR1 has given you the option of downloading the game and trying it for free for the next few weeks. (Information on how to do this can be found at the end of this article.) We've spent a bit of time with it already and are anxious to see more people in the skies VR1's opened up for us.  For me, online games like this live and die by their front end. That's one of the reasons I played Tribes more than, say, Rainbow Six. A simple but sophisticated set of community and connectivity tools is crucial to my enjoyment of an online game and, on that score, Fighter Ace doesn't disappoint. The interface is extremely straightforward and makes a lot of sense right away. A news page, a chatroom and a squadron creation and management tool are all instantly accessible. The arena rooms are just as easy to navigate.  On the subject of community, the Fighter Ace folks seem pretty mature (at least by online community standards). There are a few jerks who camp the airfields and strafe you during takeoff but, for the most part, the players are more interested in playing than bitching. In fact, I've almost never seen anyone in the chat room (as I breeze by it on the way to the arena rooms).  The level of competition in Fighter Ace can be pretty stiff. Combat in the advanced rooms is unforgiving (although most players are willing to sit and chat with you for a while as you fly around the arena). Luckily there are a wide variety of rooms you can choose from. If you're particularly clueless, you can log on to any of the training arenas to get oriented to the game. Practice rooms can let you play without affecting your global ranking. (Your stats are tracked and you're ranked according to how well you've done.)  Most of the folks seem to gravitate towards the intermediate and arcade arenas. The relaxed realism is much more inviting for a greater number of people and it's where the most people are that you'll have the most fun. The one-on-one duels in the advanced rooms are fun as well, but it's the big furballs that really bring the game to life. Although there's some slight warping from time to time, the network code is remarkably stable and more than capable of rendering lots of flyers in a single arena with little slowdown (granted, I'm playing on an industrial strength, Mr. T class connection).  Each arena (representing the Pacific, European and African theaters) is designed so that your time to target is pretty short. At least short by flight sim standards. There's rarely more than four or five minutes towards all but the most distant targets and, if you pick your airfield correctly, you can be in the thick of the action in just a minute or two. Once you get shot down, land or bail out, you'll have the chance to change your plane, your airfield. If you back out of the interface far enough, you can even change sides.  The Fighter Ace team and the Fighter Ace Volunteer Group host tournaments and other events from time to time as well. There've been just a couple of these this week including Wednesday Warnight. Like I said, the last one had a maximum of 180 people in the arena while I was playing and, even with that many flyers in the air, the framerate was pretty good.  If I remember correctly, the last game had something like 50 different planes. This one has over 70 with some impressive additions. All the classic planes are here: Hellcats, Mustangs, and Dauntlesses can square off against Spitfires, Tempests and Hurricanes (there are no ~allies~ in many of these games) while Russian Ratas and Sturmoviks go head to head with German FW-190s, Bf-109s and Stukas or Japanese Zekes, Georges and Vals. You can check out the full list of planes at the Fighter Ace website.  As impressive as the roster is, there are still a few notable planes missing (I know: bitch, bitch). I appreciate the fact that the game models two versions of the Wildcat, but do we really need the slight redundancy provided by these duplicates when some of us might like to try out the Helldiver? Okay, okay, maybe the Helldiver is stretching it a bit but I find it hard to believe that VR1 couldn't have done away with at least one of the five Bf-109s in the game in favor of the Me 110. And while the Mosquito's a nice bomber, where's the Skua? Given the naval nature of the Pacific theaters, it also seems strange that the Jill has been omitted.      Each plane performs uniquely across all difficulty levels. The characteristics are reduced somewhat on the arcade settings but, even so, you may be able to notice the Corsair's high torque or the way the Avenger tends to nose down. I don't much feel like test flying the planes and testing the limits of each (I was usually busy being shot at), but I still noticed things like the gentle stall of the Seafire or the excellent visibility of the Mustang. In all, the modeling is distinct enough to make the choice of plane more than a matter or raw speed or firepower.  The planes all have specific locations that can be damaged in various ways. Each area has a unique damage model and impacts the look of your plane as well as the performance. I've seen planes with just the tips of the wings shot off and, in one tragic encounter, even seen the entire back of a plane get shot off. You look pretty dumb flying around with your ass hanging out of the back of your plane. Small changes to the responsiveness or effectiveness of the various control surfaces give you a real sense that something specific was blown off your plane. Check the outside view and you can probably even see a hole where something important used to be.  When things aren't blown off, you'll see most of the control surfaces functioning. When you take off, you'll see the canopy close. Once airborne you can watch as you raise the landing gear, retract the flaps and move each of the other control surfaces. The outer view is easy controlled with the mouse so you can see your plane from any angle you choose. From within the 3D cockpit, you can use the mouse to view the sky around you. You can also opt to play with the cockpit details off and the customizable HUD will let you set up the readouts in whatever way is most comfortable.  In each arena screen you'll choose a side (from those available) and an airfield or carrier to launch from. Next you'll choose from the available plane models. Fortunately the plane selection menu rates each plane in terms of durability, maneuverability, firepower, speed, climb rate and ground attack strength. Specs on the plane and its weapon are also included along with a short essay on the historical importance of each plane.  A handy drop-down menu lets you select the armament for your plane and you can even set the convergence of your guns. (Since many guns are mounted so far apart on the wings, the barrels are angled in so that the fire is concentrated on a single point ahead of the plane.) This is an awesome feature as it allows you to set your guns for maximum effectiveness at the distances you typically prefer to fight. You can also set the number of bombs dropped in a particular salvo and the interval between drops.  The plane models themselves aren't as beautiful as most of the other offline flight sims of the past years or so. You won't see the same level of detail here as you see in CFS2 or Sturmovik. The models are good (and animated well) and the textures are okay but it's definitely a generation behind the current titles even though it's a significant improvement over Fighter Ace II. Since the slightly lower graphical quality is a concession to the performance of the game online, I can look past the slightly muddy textures and just enjoy the framerate. The smoke and tracer effects are much more credible now and the environments are believable enough.  What did you think of Fighter Ace III?  As I said before, this game is free until April 1. That ought to be enough to get most of you excited about it already. Between now and April 1 you can download and play Fighter Ace III for free. Just head to the website, download the software, create an account and you should be set to play for the next three weeks. As of April 1, VR1 will start charging $10 a month for subscription or $50 for a whole six months.  The boxed copy of the game will ship sometime in April and, at that point, all of us who've been freeloading will have to go out and buy a copy. There's no definite release date and no definite price yet (at least not according to the VR1 representative we spoke to today) but it should be a price comparable to the titles already on the market. VR1's told us that there will be only the smallest of changes between the currently available version and the final boxed copy. Except that the current one is free, of course. Cheapskates. I really liked Fighter Ace II and the new version is a big improvement. The technology is impressive in terms of its details, stability and ease of use. It's one of those games that's great to play whether you've got twenty minutes or three hours. Online games like these are completely dependent on community and it's heartening to see so many people already on the servers. If the game has one inherent flaw, it's that you have to go along with the crowds. There is plenty of opportunity to enjoy flying by yourself but, in order for the game to be exciting you need to play on the populated servers. This is sort of out of your hands but there's usually a lot of action on the arcade server and at least one of the intermediate servers. Advanced rooms are pretty thin by comparison but the competition is much more ferocious.In all, I'm really impressed with the game right now. As more and more people learn about it, there are bound to be more opportunities to jump in and see the kind of action you're looking for. Unless you're looking for the kind of action you can only get by yourself. Fighter Ace can't help you there. In the meantime, I'm going to get back to playing.", "date": "Mar 7, 2002"}
