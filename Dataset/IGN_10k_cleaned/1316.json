There's just no other way to explain away three uniformly derivative titles being issued under the same brand name; Battleship to be specific.  Cynics may recall the original, mediocre computer conversion of the classic board game issued in 1996, which was quickly joined the following year by Battleship Classic, a virtually identical recreation of the first product, save with movies in place of 3D background art.  Still, even if you, as a member of Generation I (short for ~I don't give a crap~) don't remember these waterlogged disasters, jaded reviewers do, making Battleship: Surface Thunder's preponderance of redeeming values more of a shocker than one would imagine.  For starters, consider that this is a two-in-one package.  Although Surface Thunder retreads old ground yet again, packing ANOTHER port of classic Battleship in, it's not the main attraction this season.  Despite the simple, yet wholly satisfying fun and great graphics of this mini-game, it's the all-new action shooter that's loosely based around the product's naval theme which'll be captivating your attention.  Essentially, what owners are buying into is a family oriented diversion that offers something for mom and pop as well as the pizza-faced, hyperactive, Limp Bizkit worshipping fruit of their loins.  Honestly, anyone that can, in good conscience, refer to themself as a lifelong gamer has played this game before, albeit under a gajillion different names and costumes.  As the captain of a lone battleship stuck deep within the boundaries of hostile waters, you've got to blast your way out.  On the bright side, the little steel juggernaut can spit cannonfire from its portside and starboard bows, as well as from the front and rear.  That said, you'll have to deftly pilot your way through the nooks and crannies of several missions' maps, working four fire buttons as fast as humanly possible to wipe out an onslaught of enemy carriers, PT boats, subs, biplanes, zeppelins, and sea serpents before the day is won.  Floating TNT and flame barrels add to the fun, as do powerups ranging from depth charges to turbos, top speed boosters, surface to air rockets, mines and more.  This sweet little Shipwreckers style of entertainment's as spiritually fulfilling  as a trip to Sin City, but strangely addictive once you get into it.  Mission goals stay within the bounds of reason, relying on a body count or number of transport rescues for their foundation, which is about all the experience really called for.  Hasbro hasn't set out to redefine people's expectations here, merely to cater to an audience that loves cheap thrills, and those who were weaned on console systems way back in the day should appreciate the gesture. As a PC game goes, Surface Thunder could've used some more meat on its bones, although the suave classic mode should, by all rights, soothe the savage critic.  Still, the game would've tanked were it not for a snazzy presentation.  Aside from water textures that are filled with visible cracks, the environment looks gorgeous in its colorful, polygon intensive majesty.  Riverside structures, including depots, gun turrets, and lighthouses give the settings some depth, as they'd otherwise be little more than hilly areas interspersed by heavily trafficked waterways.  Excellent smoke, flame and particle effects jazz up the decor, backed up by horn-heavy battle tunes and the title screen's seemingly out of place funk ditty.  Oh well... a little bit of George Clinton's just fine with this journalist.  And voila - there you have it.  Battleship: Surface Thunder isn't rubbing shoulders with the PC greats, though it deserves to find a good home with proponents of casual entertainment.  The trite design mentality glorified by this product will preclude stuffier members of the public from appreciating its finer virtues, but screw the tightwads.  Given the pair of traditional and new wave choices on offer, age and preference shouldn't be a boundary to player appreciation, meaning that whether the game's meant for a friend, loved one, or family in need, it's bound for smooth sailing.  -- Scott Steinberg Want to share your opinions with the world?

Battleship is a great two-player game, but I don't really like playing the computer -- it's just unnatural to play this game without having your opponent to mock. And besides, the AI just works a bit too conveniently sometimes. As a two-player game, it's very good. It may be a bit slow for most people expecting a lot of action, but it's a great alternative to strategy games like chess. And it's a lot more violent, too!", "date": "Oct 6, 2000"}
