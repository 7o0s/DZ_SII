In many ways this game laid the foundations for modern real-time strategy. Following the success of Dune II, Westwood unleashed Command & Conquer in 1995 and it too was a monstrous hit. Unfortunately the series ran into a speed bump with the release of Command & Conquer 2: Tiberium Sun in 1999. It wasn't so much that the game was particularly bad, more a case of it looking a tad dowdy next to some insanely good competition. Let's not forget that between 1995 and 1999 players gorged themselves on a glut of superb RTS offerings which included the likes of Warcraft II, Starcraft, Total Annihilation and Age of Empires II. By comparison Tiberium Sun seemed a little archaic, or, to borrow a line from my review at that time: ~a bit like a heavily made up grandma dressed in hotpants and bikini top.~   In the ensuing years Command & Conquer's creators (Westwood Studios) were put out to corporate pasture, but EA weren't about to let one of the biggest names in RTS fizzle out. After all, number one on the list of corporate deadly sins is ~Thou shalt not risk megabucks on something fresh and original when thou canst knock out a quick sequel,~ but we digress. All cynicism aside, we're glad EA decided to resurrect this classic RTS series because the latest instalment, Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars, kicks buttock on a grand scale!    See what the US guys thought of C&C3 in their video review.   Like its predecessors, Tiberium Wars centres on the conflict between the Global Defence Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod. This time around there's also a third party involved but we'll get to them later. As the game begins The Brotherhood of Nod has just nuked the GDI's orbital military command centre. Naturally this makes the folks at GDI a little tetchy and provides ample justification for the two old foes to go at it hammer and tongs once more.   The player's first task is to pick a faction - either the GDI or the Brotherhood of Nod. Once you've made your choice you're free to wade into the corresponding single player campaign. Like previous games in the series, players select missions from a map-based menu system called the Theatre of War. Single player missions span the globe and there are even some set in Australia, which makes a nice change for those of us living at the arse-end of the world (and what a lovely arse it is just quietly). The game's single player campaigns feature an incredibly diverse assortment of mission types, including everything from search and rescue, to Commando raids and tense timed objectives (i.e. destroy enemy power stations before they hit you with their super weapon).   There goes the neighbourhood. Or is that some kind of futuristic construction crew? I can't tell.  The underlying gameplay mechanics of C&C3 are 'old school' RTS, where players construct a base, harvest resources (in this case the alien substance known as Tiberium) and then use the proceeds to build up an army. This RTS formula is pretty antiquated by today's standards but Command & Conquer 3 pulls it off with such style and panache we're willing to overlook it.   Fans of the series will instantly recognise many of the game's structures and units, largely because most of them have been lifted straight out of the previous two instalments. On the GDI side you have infantry units like the Engineer, Commando and Sniper, along with vehicles like the APC, Pitbull and Mammoth Tank. GDI aircraft include the Orca helicopter and Firehawk jet. The Nod side features infantry units like the Saboteur, Fanatic and Militant Rocket Squad, along with trademark vehicles like the Stealth Tank, Beam Cannon and Flame Tank. Nod also gets the Venom Patrol Craft helicopter and the Vertigo Bomber. While each side is skewed towards a different style of warfare (the GDI are more conventional while Nod rely on guerrilla tactics and exotic weaponry), ultimately it can all be reduced to paper-rock-scissors where every unit has its counter-unit.   The strange mating ritual of the Robo-Snail. Beautiful in its way.  Now we come to the most interesting element in Command & Conquer 3 - the new Scrin race. Without wanting to spoil the storyline, the Scrin are an alien race who appear late in the single player campaigns. They seem to thrive on Tiberium and are overtly hostile, but aside from that their true motives remain unknown. From the get-go we feel obliged to point out that the Scrin bear an uncanny resemblance to the Protos race from Starcraft. For starters Scrin units warp in (much like the Protos buildings did in Starcraft) and some of them can even be upgraded with very Protos-like force fields. But the icing on the cake has to be the Scrin Planetary Assault Carrier, which is virtually identical to the Protos Carrier from Starcraft. Suspicious similarities aside, the Scrin make a refreshing change from GDI or Nod and they are damned fun to play.    Any game is only as good as the interface used to control it and in this area C&C3 excels. The game uses a sidebar system which incorporates a series of tabbed menus. Players can use these tabs to control everything from base construction to unit production queues. There's also a control bar at the bottom left of the screen where players can adjust the AI states of their units and assign them waypoints. Players can even assign hotkeys to camera bookmarks making it dead simple to jump to points of interest on the map. In general we found the interface to be unobtrusive and extremely intuitive.   Speaking of AI, the game features four difficulty levels ranging from Easy to Brutal. For the most part we found AI opponents in single player missions and Skirmish games to be more than a handful. Players even have the option of customising the AI tactics of computer-controlled opponents in Skirmish games (i.e. Rusher, Turtle and so on). This feature comes in very handy when you're trying to devise strategies for human opponents who favour a certain style of play.   I'd wager that   As a game progresses players can gain periodic access to support powers by building the relevant structure. For example building a GDI Space Command Uplink will give players access to Shockwave Artillery strikes (which destroys enemy units and temporarily disables mechanical units), or building a Scrin Stasis Chamber will give players access to a Stasis Shield (which bestows temporary invulnerability on units within the target area). Needless to say the judicious use of these support powers can turn the tide of battle.   One of the game's best features is the range of unit customisation options available through tech upgrades. For example GDI players can provide their Orcas with sensor pods for recon duties, change the missile load-out on their Firehawks (to suit land or air targets) or upgrade their Zone Troopers into stealth detecting super soldiers. And this is just the tip of the iceberg.   Other nice touches include the 'Reverse Move' which allows units like tanks to keep their thickest armour facing enemy fire at all times, along with the ability of certain infantry units (i.e. Engineers, Saboteurs, Assimilators) to commandeer the wrecked husks of heavy artillery units (i.e. Avatar Warmechs, Juggernauts, Annihilator Tripods) and the way game maps display nav point markers which point to individual mission goals.   Defcon eat your heart out.  While Command & Conquer 3's multiplayer component allows up to eight players to slug it out over a network or online, there's only one basic game type on offer (not including ranked and unranked variants). Players can only tweak a meagre assortment of options like starting credits, the presence of random crates and player handicaps. That said the game does feature Battlecast mode which allows players to broadcast their matches online, complete with a designated commentator. There's also full VOIP support, but that's par for the course these days.   Back in 1995 full motion video sequences were all the rage and the original Command & Conquer was chock full of them. While FMV has been out of vogue for the last 10 years or so, that hasn't stopped EA from inserting a veritable wad of retro FMV goodness into the latest instalment of Command & Conquer. To this end Tiberium Wars features lots of blue-screen video with performances by game veterans like Michael Ironside (also the voice of Sam Fisher in Splinter Cell) and Billy Dee Williams (who has been milking his Empire Strikes Back fame for some 24 years now). The acting in these sequences is pleasingly hammy and Billy Dee Williams appears to be either slightly drunk or really enjoying himself, or possibly a combination of the two. Another notable inclusion is the always excellent Joe Kucan, who reprises his role as Kane - the sinister leader of Nod.   Billy Dee Williams, one of the coolest guys ever, second only to Carl Weathers. Put those together and baby, you got a stew going.  In terms of in-game visuals, Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars strikes a perfect balance between quality and performance. On our review system (an Athlon 3800+, 2GB RAM with a 256MB GeForce 7800GTX) we maxed out all of the visual detail levels (including anti-aliasing) and maintained a silky smooth frame-rate, even when there were a bazillion units onscreen at the same time. As you can see from the screenshots the game looks superb with a myriad of subtle visual details (like the dust wakes of helicopters) and a dazzling array of lighting effects.  Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars is one of the finest examples of traditional real-time strategy weve seen to date. Sure, the game lacks the innovation and complexity of some other contemporary RTS offerings, but what it does, it does superbly well. Command & Conquer is back baby!Want to talk about it?
