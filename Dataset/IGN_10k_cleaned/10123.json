Kids from the NES and the Atari 2600's Kool-Aid Man comes M&M's Kart Racing, an all-new racing game adventure for Wii that offers about as much fun as a half-eaten bag of Peanut style. This game is bad. Not as bad as some of the other pieces of shoddy shovelware that have hit Nintendo's newest console in recent months, but still very disappointing  it's a game that'll frustrate you so much that you may very well make a permanent shift in your personal candy preference for the future, and decide to become a Reese's Pieces fan instead.   M&M's Kart Racing is yet another Mario Kart clone, as it presents cartoonish racing competition headlined by colorful mascot characters  here, the personified Red, Green, Yellow, Orange and Blue chocolate candies most recognized from their series of television commercials from the past several years. The moderate star power of the candy characters is the most impressive thing to be found in this package, which is a sad reality that sets you up well to be disappointed in every other area of the game.    The racing is boring. You'd think that the playful personalities of the M&M's characters might be reflected in some engaging way in the gameplay, but they're not. It's just straightforward racing around non-interactive tracks, with nothing to do but drive. There are no items to use to attack your opponents. There are no shortcuts to find to get ahead of the pack. There are no advanced techniques to achieve in controlling your kart, like power sliding or boosting. It's just you and an open course, and you tilt the Wii Remote left and right while holding down the 2 Button to accelerate. That's it.   Only 997 to go.  Except the courses aren't really that open  most of the tracks in M&M's Kart Racing are claustrophobically constructed and walled in, composed of uninteresting interior areas that are difficult to navigate and often cause bottlenecks as multiple racers try to pass through the same too-tight doorways. This is one of the worst elements of design in bad Mario Kart clones, as the level designs have absolutely no ~flow~ to them at all. It's a common occurrence that you'll get stuck in a corner or run straight into a wall and have to back up, pull around and start driving again from a dead stop  because the courses are just put together that poorly.   One thing that M&M's Kart Racing does to try to distract you from the mindlessness of the core gameplay is pepper the tracks with floating, collectible chocolate coins. These pick-ups do nothing to affect your kart  there's no increased acceleration to be gained by gathering them, or anything like that. They're simply there as a collectible currency to be used back in the game's Garage, where you can end up earning unlockable vehicles like a hovercraft and an SUV. That's all pointless in the end, too, though  the unlockable vehicles actually handle more poorly than the standard, default karts. You'll ignore the fact that you've earned them before long.   If you tire of the tedium of racing by yourself, M&M's does offer a multiplayer option  but with a maximum of two players. There's no four-player mode, and no battle mode. Really, if you're going to clone Mario Kart, you've got to at least offer as many options as Mario does. But M&M's doesn't, and its split-screen two-player head-to-head offers an only mildly interesting competition between you and friend. It also reveals a further failing of the game, in the area of graphics  the framerate, while already poor in single-player modes, drops to a preposterously low amount when the screen is split. You can see the refresh lines washing over the backgrounds, and pop-up plagues any element placed in the distance. Ridiculous.    ...and if that's all not enough for you, M&M's Kart Racing also features interminably long loading screens between each race and menu. It's such a major part of the experience that the official website for the game actually put out a promotional screenshot of the loading screen. Seriously.It might be tough for die-hard fans of Mario Kart to continue to wait for that series' imminent arrival on Wii, especially now that we know that we gamers here in the States will be the last to get it. But don't despair to the point that you turn to any of these poor man's clones for a racing fix  they're not worth your time, and certainly not worth your money. M&M's Kart Racing is particularly poor, and, sadly, is actually not as appealing a product as Data Design Interactive's Myth Makers: Super Kart GP. At least that game has items, shortcuts and four-player support, even if it is plagued by its own set of problems.", "date": "Mar 3, 2008"}
