Developed by the annoyingly-named A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. (love typing that one out, fellas) and published by Capcom, Rocketmen is a top-down arcade-style shooter based on a license for a kids' constructible strategy game.   What's a constructible strategy game, you ask? Don't worry your pretty little head about it. There's no strategy in Rocketmen: Axis of Evil and nothing is constructible. The core gameplay involves moving your character around linear levels, shooting with the right analog stick and moving with the left. It's a mechanic as age-old as Robotron: 2084 and it largely works well.   Behind the action is a paper-thin sci-fi story involving Martians, Venusians and superweapons, all told through odd comic book-like cutscenes that include dialog bubbles, captions and static but colorful characters.    Baddies galore. Unlike most shoot-em-ups, Rocketmen begins with a character creation screen, and I was able to make mine appear nude completely by accident. I picked a preposterously busty female warrior, and her outfit defaulted to a flesh-toned bodysuit that made more than one IGN editor blush. Sure, she was completely covered by her skin-colored war leotard, but at a glance, she looked like she was preparing to do battle in her birthday suit.     The first thing I noticed about Rocketmen after I created my boldly nude space warrioress was that the cutscenes are extremely primitive for a presentation on an HD console. They look like Flash animations -- the characters' lips don't move, they gesture woodenly and the text in dialog bubbles is sometimes out of whack. To add insult to injury, the writing in Rocketmen is painfully corny in parts, and most attempts at kooky humor fall flat.    But once I made my way out of the painfully long intro and into the game itself, I was encouraged. The environments look sharp, and the developers did a good job of adding a look of depth to the levels. Fighting the Martians and other foes that came my way was fairly rewarding, especially once I started picking up lasers, shotguns, razors (guns that shoot sawblades) and other weapons along the way.   Beware explosions. Weapon pickups are plentiful in Rocketmen, and each gun you grab up will deplete over time (with unlimited ammo). After getting a shotgun, for example, you'll have about 30 seconds to use it as much as you can before it disappears. There are also secondary weapons such as rockets, grenades, proximity mines and turrets throughout each level. Each time you pick them up, they'll be placed in your inventory for use at your discretion.   Rocketmen gets some core shmup stuff right, but it also gets some of it horribly wrong. For starters, there's the camera, which is even more aggressive than the Scorch Dragons you'll encounter about halfway through the game. Rather than centering on your character wherever she goes, the camera fixes itself in predetermined ways, often resulting in cut-off pathways and maddening missed opportunities.   One of the things A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. did right was to include secondary objectives in Rocketmen aside from the standard grinding through levels. By hitting the action button at certain key points in each level (think Lego Star Wars) you can uncover secondary weapons; gather the elements titanium, newtonium and carbon for later use in the shop; or even free political prisoners aboard an enemy ship (long story).      Unfortunately the camera system is so unpredictable and unforgiving that I ended up missing several of these secondary objectives in every level I played. That's because there's no backtracking in Rocketmen, not even an inch. Even if you can see an objective, weapon or power-up winking behind you, it's usually irretrievable. This wouldn't be so bad if the camera tracked in a predictable way, but it doesn't. It moves vertiginously around corners, shifts oddly and makes it impossible to plan ahead.    These issues are especially frustrating because, at the end of each level you're awarded medals (gold silver and bronze) depending on, among other things, how many secondary objectives you completed. So basically I'm given a task, forced to fight the camera to complete it, then told how poorly a job I did of it at the end of each level. It's almost more than my fragile ego can take.   Shootin' to kill. Rocketmen features four-player co-op, and it's actually a nice feature. Playing through the levels with friends makes the camera problems a bit more bearable, as you can each spread out to cover all the angles.    Jumping online with the PS3 version can be temperamental, and while it worked most of the time, I had several issues connecting properly. Lag also popped up on occasion, but the majority of my matches went off without a hitch.     You might see Rocketmen described as having RPG elements. That may be technically true, but it's really only a nominal addition to the game. After each level, you'll be able to spend your experience points (gained from killin') to upgrade your character's stats, which include speed, damage, demolition, engineering, evasion and life. Although I spent liberally on all of the above, I didn't see much of a change in my character's abilities along the way. If there were changes, they didn't seem to matter much in my everyday Martian killing business.   As far as I could tell, the only penalty for death in Rocketmen is a loss of experience points. So if you don't care about increasing your character's stats all that much, dying probably won't prove an insurmountable obstacle to finishing the game.   This looks dangerous. I was underwhelmed by the skill leveling in Rocketmen, but I was impressed by the weapon upgrade system. Gather elements dropped from consoles, destructible items and fallen enemies, and you can spend them on upgrades in the shop between levels. Each weapon type has four slots, many of which are specific to that weapon. If you're partial to the razor gun, put some points into the bounciness of its sawblades. If lasers are your thing, bump up their damage level for maximum lasering.   Despite its basic arcade-style gameplay, there's a lot I don't understand about Rocketmen: Axis of Evil. Why the Axis of Evil subtitle? Are Wiz Kidz and A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. intentionally implying the regimes of North Korea, Iran and Iraq in an attempt to make an allegorical statement via a shmupped kids' strategy tabletop game? If so, it was lost on me. Why use this license at all, and one so random at that? Were the assets, such as they are, already available and thus an easy upload between levels? Why is there a talking security camera that quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson? I could go on.   Rocketmen's problems are unfortunate because it had a lot of potential. The actual gameplay is basically fun, the weapons are fine, the enemies are interesting enough, and the developers seem to have a feel for pacing. Just when I was tiring of the indoor levels at the beginning of the game, they threw an outdoor level my way. But the positives get bogged down in the frustration of the camera, the inexplicable cutscenes and the general schizophrenic feel of the whole package.Rocketmen is a game in search of a center. The half-hearted RPG nods, quixotic story treatment and frustrating camera detract from a core of solid gameplay. The basics are there, but Rocketmen's problems overshadow the basic shoot-em-up beneath. If you're dying for a Smash TV wannabe right this minute, give this one a try. Otherwise, wait for something that gets it all right.", "date": "Mar 7, 2008"}
