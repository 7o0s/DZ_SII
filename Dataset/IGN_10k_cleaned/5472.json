Tetris. Pac-Man. And JAMDAT Bowling. Spend a few minutes if JAMDAT Bowling and you'll see why -- it's because you can't spend only a few minutes with it. The easy to pick up game play and the solid physics make it an irresistible game for not only stolen leisure moments, but any time you have a hankering for a good game.   This kind of addictive game play makes JAMDAT Bowling 3D a natural fit for Verizon Wireless' new V CAST service. And a necessary fit. Because as much as we're into the 3D revolution in cellphone games, even we have to admit that some of these newer titles aren't that great. They may look good, but some of them either don't advance the ball whatsoever, or are downright dull.   This is most certaibnly not the case with JAMDAT Bowling 3D. Now, you could argue that JAMDAT Bowling 3D doesn't necessarily ~advance the ball~ either, but JAMDAT's bowling game is one of those exceptions where you're not exactly wanting to see the game play -- as perfectly balanced as it is -- be tweaked with for the sake of attempted innovation. Instead, JAMDAT Bowling 3D is more like a homecooked meal. It's always there, just the way you remember it.   The basic elements of JAMDAT Bowling 3D are the same. You line up your ball on the lane and then use a system of meters to determine the power and spin of the roll. Basic, but it really covers the essence of the sport. Anybody can roll a decent game with JAMDAT's system -- but only with significant practice can you start racking up turkeys on the way to the perfect 300 game.   JAMDAT Bowling 3D features a pass-the-phone multiplayer option, but we were really holding out for an online multiplayer mode. After all, V CAST is broadband, so it really shouldn't be much of an issue to set up the online service.   JAMDAT Bowling 3D does add some nice visual flourishes to the sport. The big one is the dynamic camera angles that you can switch on the fly while playing. The camera remains anchored behind the lane when you line up a shot, but once you let it go, try cycling through the angles to watch the ball's path as it hurls toward the pins. This is purely a cosmetic enhancement, it doesn't affect game play one bit, but it's cool nonetheless.   JAMDAT Bowling 3D also features other graphic enhancements, such as the front-end, which has been redesigned as a JAMDAT TV. There are disco- and street-themed lanes, as well as different colored bowling balls. The in-game graphics, while you line up your shot, have also been improved.   JAMDAT has added some nice audio, too. While playing, you hear the ambient noise of a bowling alley, such as games happening on other lanes. There are also cheers and jeers depending on your performance. Roll a strike, and not only do you get the satisfying tumble of the pins, but also a nice round of applause.JAMDAT Bowling 3D is one of the best of the V CAST launch title, despite its very casual appeal. Rather than gut the game, JAMDAT wisely put a useful (and attractive) 3D dressing on their bestseller and leave the core play alone. This is one of the V CAST games you might as well purchase outright rather than subscribe to, as it's a game you'll come back to again and again. I wish the game offered online mutliplayer, but the pass-the-phone stuff is a decent substitute. Perhaps next time, JAMDAT?", "date": "Feb 5, 2005"}
