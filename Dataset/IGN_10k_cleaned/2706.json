In Dark Vengeance players get to do what they usually do, run around a massive dungeon hacking enemies to bits with fantastic weaponry and magic. While the came embraces the usual dungeon crawling play mechanics, it does have a few unique twists that attempt to set it apart from its fantasy brethren while succumbing to many of the genre's worst flaws.   One thing that can be said for Dark Vengeance is that it offers the player radically different experiences based on an initial character choice.You can play through the game as a spell casting warlock, a weapon swinging gladiator and a trickster, which is perhaps the most unique character in the game. Each one has its own fighting style, strength and weakness. The spell caster does better at a distance, the gladiator in hand to hand, and the Trickster, well, he can do well at long range and hand to hand. Picking different characters doesn't get you a different dungeon, but it will radically change the way you play through the dungeon. The character differences come out most, though, in the multiplayer game. Multiplay in any game is all about individual style, and in that Dark Vengeance delivers. All the characters are good for multiplay, but it's likely that only one will really suit you. The multiplayer levels are large arenas that suit themselves to the strengths and weaknesses of all the characters, none having any clear advantages.    On the visual side, Dark Vengeance looks fantastic. Character renders are highly detailed and articulated as are your opponents. The environments have a slightly creepy feel, but suffer from the all to common texture seeming flaw. The rooms themselves also tend to be repetitively designed, resulting in an unwanted feeling of dj vu as you go through the same hall over and over and over.   While the physical enemies are always a problem, the biggest opponent in the game is the poor camera. Dark Vengeance is a third person perspective game, so you're stuck looking at the world from right behind your character. While that view may show off the models nicely, it makes seeing around corners or close up fighting really difficult. In fact, if you move up close to a corner or wall, chances are the camera will go wacky on you. The camera is worst, though, for the gladiator, as he is easily the largest of the characters, obscuring even more of your view of the game world. Direct player camera control would have done a lot to alleviate the issue.   Dark Vengeance's one two combo is the poor camera and difficult control. You can use the mouse to look around, but somehow, it just doesn't work right, in part because of the third person view. You can also only control the character with the keyboard, a flaw which long time Quake mouse players will find irritating. Combat, although well done, suffers from an odd control design. Attacking is accomplished by pressing both an attack and a direction key, making movement and attacking mutually exclusive. Dark Vengeance also doesn't offer key assignments or strafing.   The one area where Dark Vengeance is truly outstanding, though, is multiplayer. The game supports up to 32 players over a network making for a truly massive deathmatch.    If you can overlook the poor control and wacky camera, Dark Vengeance is an average single player game and an outstanding multiplayer title.", "date": "Jun 7, 2002"}
