Rather than helping the rest of the hive, be they harmlessly collecting pollen for a delicious stash of honey, or mercilessly attacking all humans who even dare bring food into their presence (though this could just be my problem), they are on a mission to rescue their fellow insects from certain doom at the hands of the evil spiders, the arachnids plan to ransom them for the honey vats. Whilst other developers might use this framework to create yet another derivative platformer, however, Crawfish Interactive has taken a slightly different approach... [Ed. Note: Acclaim released this game as The New Adventures of Mary Kate and Ashley at the beginning of this year, and used the engine again in Mary-Kate and Ashley Get a Clue released a month ago. Most of the levels in this game are identical to the ones used in the first Mary-Kate and Ashley game.] Features: Over 120 levels Play as three different insects Many puzzles, requiring teamwork Password Save For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  If you've ever played the classic The Lost Vikings, released on numerous formats, you'll feel right at home with this game, since if follows the same, basic formula. Each of the many levels includes a number of tricky puzzles that must be solved before you can rescue one of your insect-friends, trapped behind a spider's web. Three insects are under your control, each possessing different abilities: Maya, for example, is the only character able to pull switches; and Willy's springy head allows his friends to leap to places that would be otherwise unreachable.  Success can be achieved only through combining these talents in order to destroy the webs imprisoning the captive bees - teamwork is the name of the game. By pressing select, you can flip quickly from one character to another, manoeuvring one to where it's needed before swapping to another and using its own abilities to overcome the obstacles. As well as the puzzles, there are the standard enemies to avoid and gaps to jump across. The levels also hold bonus objects that can be collected, both to increase the score and to provide a challenge beyond that of simply getting to the next stage.  Whilst this is a truly original concept, on the GBC at least, it hasn't been as executed as brilliantly as it could have been. Despite my love of The Lost Vikings, I found the first levels incredibly slow and dull, too simplistic to really grab my attention; and rather than being long and sprawling, they are small and confined, some occupying a mere single screen, making the solutions rather obvious and hosting none of the intricate design-work found in the older title. The characters, too, have none of the charm or appeal of our Norse friends: the sprites are simple and twee in a way that makes them sickeningly cute, childish rather than loveable.  This game can be played on either a regular Game Boy or a Game Boy Color, and, frankly, it shows. Though the backgrounds themselves are fairly detailed, the colour schemes are not, lacking the vivid appearance that could have made this game feel more exciting: each object seems to be coloured using just two or three shades, making the visuals drab and uninteresting, hardly enticing you to play. The music is tolerable, though inane enough to make the weak-willed reach for the volume control, desperate to escape the derivatively cheerful, happy soundtrack. A bigger complaint is that the same tune is used for every level, producing a considerable risk to the sanity of the player.  What this game isn't, by any means, is bad. The later levels are somewhat more complex, requiring a great deal of thought and teamwork - and there are plenty of them, so if this sort of game is your thing, Maya definitely offers good value for money, the passwords relieving the boredom of replaying earlier stages. It just isn't always particularly fun. Maya is a good, original game that could benefit from being slightly more, well, interesting. Whilst it's pretty basic in the technical department, the game is well put together and fairly enjoyable - and, more importantly, there's nothing else like it on the console. If you love The Lost Vikings, then certainly give this a shot - but be forewarned: as far as I'm concerned, it isn't even in the same league.Note: Maya the Bee and her Friends is currently only available in Europe  Acclaim has no plans on bringing this game to the US  if this game interests you, you might want to look into importing the game, or better yet, grab The Adventures of Mary-Kate and Ashley. It's the same thing.", "date": "Jul 26, 2000"}
