Remember all the good quality games we used to get from this company? Well, Konami is trying to get back into shape, and Suikoden, the year's best RPG, is a step in the right direction.The story is simple. You are the son of the General Teo, one of the emperor's most powerful generals. Immediately, your father leaves to fight a battle up north leaving a few of his trusted friends to watch over of you. Soon after, you come to realize that you and your father been serving on the wrong side. The Emperor and his generals' minds have been brainwashed. The result is unhappy subjects and an enslaved country. Knowing this you join the Liberation Army and when their heroic leader is assassinated by the baddies, you are chosen as leader. Your job now is to recruit thousands of men to join the Liberation Army and restore peace to the country.Suikoden is full of beautiful backgrounds (especially your castle which you can name), not to mention outstanding effects for magic spells. The music is incredible, rivaling the soundtrack of Square's Final Fantasy 3! Some of the sound effects used in spells are reminiscent of those taken off old He-Man episodes, which oddly enough sounds terrific. All this plus intricate plot twists and an inspiring storyline constantly push this game forward.Suikoden is undeniably one of the best RPGs ever made. Not only that, but Suikoden isn't a game that can be finished in a few days either. Suikoden is long (about 25+ hours) and it doesn't get boring... ever.Jeff Chen", "date": "Jan 23, 1997"}
