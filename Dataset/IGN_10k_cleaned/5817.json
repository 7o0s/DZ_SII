{"name": "Fantastic 4", "name_review": "Fantastic Four", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/06/15/fantastic-four-3", "text": "The Marvel movie money train continues with Fantastic Four, and thanks to their partnership with the comics juggernaught, MFORMA has released a side-scrolling action game based on the upcoming movie franchise. You play as all four of the superheroes -- Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and The Thing -- in a series of uneventful missions that involve lots of side-to-side movement and destruction of robots, etc.   But the gameplay itself is actually not the star of Fantastic Four. Rather, you will likely find yourself equal parts mesmerized and puzzled by the visual techniques employed by the game. The game uses primitives, just basic shapes, to compose the fantastic family forms. Because the game is constantly zooming in and out, it is about to scale the primitives without taking a hit in frame rate. We downloaded the game on a Sanyo 8200 -- like many undoubtedly will -- and can indeed testify that the game runs at a smooth clip.   The use of primitives is incredibly striking. While the characters lack detail you might expect, they are still immediately recognizable. The Thing is a collection of orange blocks assembled into a brickhouse human form. The Human Torch is a collection of red shapes that form a gaunt human outline.   Each team member is granted extra powers beyond basic attacks, such as The Thing's rage which makes him an unstoppable force or the Human Torch's explosion, which incinerates everything around him (displayed by a primitive orange circle erupting from the center of his form). These special powers are gained by picking up blue crystals (sometimes hard to see), and then mapped to one of the handset's soft keys.   Considering the excellent visuals and nice menagerie of superpowers, it's disappointing that the gameplay itself is so average. Most of the game is spent performing basic tasks like beating back robots or collecting items/tokens.    Control is difficult to get used to, as it is incredibly floaty. This actually fits the visual style quite well, since the whole game looks like a keyhole view into some alternate reality, but it takes some getting used to. Sure, Mrs. Richards is acrobatic, but we doubt she can jump four times her height and extend a leg that levels everything in its path.   There are bonuses for the family to obtain. The completion of levels results in a ~4~ token. Collect four of those (notice a theme?) and you get bonuses like a score multiplier and extra lives.  Fantastic Four is one of the most visually impressive games I've seen for mobile -- even if it technically isn't the most advanced, it's certainly one of the most interesting to look at. The manipulation of the primitives is fun to watch. Too bad the game beyond the primitives is, well, primitive. Collect this token. Kick that enemy. Zzz. If you have a few spare bucks and you want to see a visually arresting game, by all means, DL Fantastic Four. But just scale back your gameplay expectations.", "date": "Jun 15, 2005"}
