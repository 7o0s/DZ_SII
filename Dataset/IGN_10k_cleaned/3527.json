While that's the kind of pace usually reserved for titles that put up permanent residence at the top of the sales charts, 3DO's built a large enough following (apparently) to justify two expansions for the core game which shipped last spring. And while I've been a big fan of the series, I'm at a loss to discover a compelling reason to head out and pick up this latest expansion.Imagine the following scenario: You head out to the store and drop thirty dollars to pick up the latest Heroes of Might and Magic expansion, The Winds of War. Getting home, you install the game, unplug the phone and grab a 2-liter of Diet Shasta and settle in for some serious playing. Here's where the disappointment starts.You'll find that this expansion preserves everything you love about the series. The stories are a little stale and  clichd, but fans of turn-based fantasy strategy would be hard pressed to find a game that offers as much tactical depth as the Heroes series. The sense of adventure and the range of character advancement are also still high points for the genre. So what's not to like?You see, the problem is that there's very little that's new in this expansion. While The Gathering Storm offered only minor additions, the fact that it included the multiplayer functionality missing in Heroes IV eased us in to accepting the small number of new features. The Winds of War sadly offers nothing that's all that compelling -- the few new creatures and new maps are welcome to be sure, but unless you're a die-hard Heroes fan, it's hardly worth the $30 selling price.The Winds of War grants players the chance to try out any of five new campaigns all tied together by an assault on the land of Channon. By themselves, the missions are a bit harder than those in The Gathering Storm with enemies that are a bit more active. As a means of balancing the difficulty and maintaining narrative focus, the campaigns are quite short. Once you finish the fifteen or so missions in these five campaigns, you'll unlock a final mission where you take on four other heroes in competition for control of the Five Kingdoms.It's a nice attempt to fashion a single story out of five separate campaigns, and one that was used to decent effect in The Gathering Storm. But while the developers have made considerable efforts to involve you in the story, having heroes with names like Spazz and Mysterio the Magnificent tends to keep your interest from developing fully. I'm not sure if Mongo the barbarian is an homage to Mel Brooks or Mongo Santamaria.One of my bigger gripes against the previous expansion was its lack of single scenarios. Things have improved considerably on this score with the addition of 25 new one-shot maps. These are, for the most part, quite engaging and usually offer up a nice little gimmick, either in mission or map design. But even though they're simply gimmicks, the weirdly-shaped maps (one is shaped like a Genie's lamp) do a lot to add variety and interest to the game.The only real complaint I can level against the maps are that so many of them have been created by fans of the game. I have no problem with user-created content appearing in expansions; I think it's an excellent way to offer a fresh new perspective, particularly so in a series as long and popular as this one. But what irritates me is that these types of additions are freely available right now in the form of downloads. It seems strange to ask us to pay for new maps when we could easily download ones that are comparable in terms of quality and inventiveness. Gathering Storm has a map-editor, after all.The game's three new creatures are pleasant enough (as long as you're not facing them in battle) but I wanted more and different additions. When you're only offering three new creatures, you'd better make damn sure that they're conveniently available and fill a hole in the game. Neither applies here. First, none of the new creatures can be built by players; they must all be purchased from pre-determined locations on the map. (There are some new vendors for existing creatures as well.) Beyond that, the new creatures are all fourth level so you won't be able to use them in any great numbers. Not being able to build these new creatures in your town obviously is a concession to story-telling and play balance. Still, their relative absence from the game makes it tough to count them among the reasons to play The Winds of War. Additionally, I'd still like to see a bit more range among the new creatures. Some schools still seem a bit light when it comes to high-level creatures, particularly so with the addition of more heavy-hitters among the Might and Chaos schools.    By themselves, the creatures are useful and help to open up a few new tactical options. The catapult now grants you the ability to strike at hidden units, making things a bit tougher for the enemy archers in the rear ranks. The new Frenzied Gnasher is a real brute that's completely immune to all magic. As a berserk unit it moves and attacks according to the AI rather than your own orders. Finally, the Megadragon now takes the throne as the strongest creature in the series. Its rarity is a mixed blessing, sparing the players from having to fight it on the one hand and punishing them by making it virtually unknown in their own armies.While I'm sure that such features are being planned for Heroes of Might and Magic V, I'd still love to have seen at least one new school of magic and one new skill category for characters. I realize, of course, that these additions have an exponential effect and that adding just one primary skill set would entail the creation of eight new hybrids. Still, it would go a long way to sustaining my interest to see new disciplines like mentalism or engineering among the existing skill sets like tactics, scouting or the magic schools. By adding a whole new magic school you could even create a brand new town type to help add a bit of variety to the game. Graphically, the game hasn't changed at all. It still lags behind titles like Disciples and Age of Wonders in terms of pure visual appeal. Nevertheless it still has its own charms, making an effort to display nearly every conceivable creature or location you'd associate with a traditional fantasy world. From elves to vampires, from imps to titans, you'll find a sprite for just about any creature you can think off. The animations are still a bit stiff and slightly awkward but the range of units is a real victory for the art team of Heroes IV. Those new additions made for the expansion fit well with the overall style. What did you think of Heroes IV: Winds of War The feature list for the game indicates that there's new music but, by and large, it seems pretty much the same as the music from the last two games. While it certainly sets the mood for short sessions, it tends to get much too repetitive much too quickly. As such, it doesn't take long before I shut the music off completely and start running my own Erich Korngold or Felix Mendelssohn MP3s in the background. Sound effects are still quite good with small ambient sounds helping to draw you further in to the game world.In brief, I'd expect a lot more for thirty bucks. While the Heroes of Might and Magic model is undoubtedly engaging and a very welcome change of pace, more has to be done with the title in order to convince me to buy a second expansion. As it is, the core game and the first expansion offer more than enough gameplay to make this extra expansion somewhat redundant.Three new creatures, largely unused, plus five new campaigns hardly makes for a compelling second expansion. This is the same amount of stuff we were offered with The Gathering Storm and at least that came with the much-needed multiplayer update. Tragically short of some fundamental or at least far-reaching updates, this title will only be of any real interest to the hardest of hardcore Heroes fans -- but then, those are the kind of players who would buy it anyway without any regard for review scores.", "date": "Mar 25, 2003"}
