Each heist has to be grander and more dangerous and there's always at least one vivacious dame to trip up the operation. Such is the life of one Arsene Lupin III. Though the madcap adventures of Japan's favorite crook have been around since the late '60s, it's only recently that the master of disguise has made an impression on American pop culture. You can thank Cartoon Network's Adult Swim for that little feat, as they've been airing the old Lupin anime with English dub the past year.   Though games based on Lupin have been released previously in Japan, this is the first major push in the US (with the exception of the early '80s arcade game Cliff Hanger). There's just a tad bit of pressure on developer Banpresto's shoulders -- if they can deliver even a mild hit, they've got a new game franchise that could last a decade. Enter Lupin the 3rd: Treasure of the Sorcerer King, a stealth adventure game that perfectly embodies the spirit of the anime, even if the gameplay is sometimes a little lacking.  FeaturesLupin and company fully realized on the PS2 Dubbed by the voice talent from the American anime Slip into clever disguises as crafty Lupin III to fool the cops and the dimwitted Inspector Zenigata Play as Lupin's cohorts Jigen and Goemon Stereo Sound  Gameplay I'll warn you now, Lupin the 3rd: Treasure of the Sorcerer King has got some noticeable gameplay flaws, but before digging into those, major props have to be served to Banpresto for doing an amazing job of capturing the essence of Lupin. Any fan will instantly recognize the (sometimes) suave bandit and his two cohorts, Jigen and Goemon, along with temptress Fujiko Mine and bumbling Inspector Zenigata (who is always two steps behind Lupin III). From visuals to vocals (provided by the anime's American voice talent), this is Lupin. The toughest thing about a license, especially one with a cult following, is doing the property justice. Banpresto has certainly done that.  If you love puzzles, we've got the thief for you.  While I'm in the kudo-tossing mood, Banpresto's other major feat was having the sense to make Treasure of the Sorcerer King a stealth adventure game. Another developer might have gone for a platformer, but that would likely have been a total disaster. As Lupin you get to sneak through several different large areas (including a train, a castle, and some ruins), hiding behind statues (you literally mimic the statue as you hide behind it), wearing disguises, and slinking past enemies.   Banpresto raided Konami's idea cabinet and turned Lupin into a cartoon version of Metal Gear Solid (minus the control and gorgeous graphics). Enemies who hear or see something pop a large ~?~ over their noggin and should you appear fishy in disguise a giant ~!~ pops up. You need to react quickly and use your special disguise action to fool the target before the exclamation point fills red. This mentally taxes Lupin, as it's not easy to stay in character forever, but at the same time a fooled enemy is susceptible to a pick pocket if you can hit the action button when the ~Pick~ meter is full. It may sound a bit complicated, but in practice it's quite simple and swiping goodies (including trading cards and health kits) from the enemy is a lot of fun.      There are over a half dozen disguises Lupin can don, each with a special action meant to fool the target. What's more interesting is that each disguise earns a slightly different response from enemies and even some different cut-scenes. In an early part of the game you are attempting to gain some key info from a hot damsel. Knock on her door as Lupin and she shouts your name in surprise, alerting the guards. Come as a copper and she'll refuse to let you in, as she was told only to open the door for Inspector Zenigata. Finding the Zenigata disguise is your way into her room (and into her heart, of course). You even earn rewards for making mistakes, like shooting off your grapnel at the wrong location and swinging into a wall for a comic splat. Good stuff.  Problems arise, however, when Lupin is caught in the act. When the guards are fully aware of Lupin and you're forced to fight (or flee), the game mechanics crumple. Controlling Lupin while trying to be stealthy is no hassle at all, but the combat is incredibly clunky. Aiming is difficult and the enemy AI is horrendous. Enemies will rarely chase you past one room before giving up and will quickly return to their simple patrol patterns. It's too basic. At any time you can give the big middle finger to the stealth element and run through each room, easily outrunning the guards as they become aware of you. The only rooms you need free of guards are those with any sort of puzzle elements. Otherwise, you can make the stealth pointless and that couldn't possibly have been the Banpresto's intention.   If only the AI wasn't so excessively flawed, this would be a good game, but far too often I found myself rolling my eyes at how easy it was to break the game's design by acting recklessly. Couple this with level design that is too basic for its own good and you have the makings of a good idea gone sour. However, Lupin's saving grace is the Resident Evil-like puzzles.   It's like Metal Gear Solid without the Metal, Gear, or Solid gameplay.  There are a slew of access codes you'll need to uncover throughout the game. One comes subtly, as a code hidden as the date on a painting hanging inconspicuously in a castle, while another is a clever riddle scribbled on a discarded piece of paper. The more RE or Tomb Raider-ish puzzles come less often, but involve figuring out which valves to turn in a room, or moving a series of statue pieces to disarm a security system. It's a bit old school, but a bit of old school that I love. It's the puzzles that kept me playing, made me ignore the flaws, and made this one worthy of a few smiles.  As a capper, gamers will be able to take control of Jigen and Goemen for short moments. They don't do puzzles or stealth, they just get to kick ass. It's cool to be able to take control of the surly Jigen and wield his lucky pistol, but sadly, he is involved in combat-heavy levels and the combat in Lupin sucks. A nice idea foiled by a flawed game engine.    Graphics Lupin won't drop or even crack jaws. The long levels involve areas where almost every room looks the same. With the exception of the end of Chapter 2, which sees Jigen (or Goemon) searching through some orange-lit ruins, the lighting and color never pops off the screen. There's more shimmer than Janet Jackson's nipple ring and enough jaggies to cause a paper cut. That said, Banpresto has done a fantastic job with the characters. Sure, every cop looks the same, but Lupin, Fujiko Mine, and the rest of the crew could not look any better. This is a perfect visual translation of the characters.   The animations which are there are wonderfully comical, but it would have been nice to see a few more sight gags and cartoonish gyrations. While a lot of effort was put into making Lupin look like a spitting image of his anime self, little mind was paid to any of the nameless extras in the background, so you get few facial experessions and far too few memorable NPCs. But dammit if Fujiko Mine doesn't look perfect, down to the last curve. Va-va-va-voom!  Sound With voice acting provided by the talent who dub the cartoon, it's hard to fault the high-pitch hijinks of Lupin and crew. What's lacking here is any real variety or cleverness in the dialogue. You'll hear NPCs and Lupin jabber the same lines again and again, none of them matching the wit of the manga that inspired it all. Weakest, though, are the sound effects which aren't comical enough at some points and are often too sparse and too generic. However, the score easily wipes away sound gripes. The simple orchestral music (some straight from the anime) is gorgeous and a perfect fit to the game's stealth atmosphere. Hard to believe, but (especially in the later chapters) this is one of the better scores you'll find in a video game. Solid job. Lupin the Third: Treasure of the Sorcerer King will likely both please and frustrate fans. If it weren't for the game mechanic issues and the incredibly short length (5-8 hours total), Lupin would be a solid game. But simplicity in a stealth game, coupled with some Forrest Gump AI, hits the game in the breadbox. Those who love Lupin will (and perhaps should) probably buy this no matter what I say. If you enjoy the anime or manga, give it at least a rental. It can be finished in a weekend and the ~Lupin~ elements are impressive. Those who have never experienced Lupin but have always been curious might find this to be a good gateway into the anime. In the end, there were more moments where I went ~ugh~ than ~ooh,~ but I was compelled enough to play Treasure of the Sorcerer King to its conclusion.", "date": "Feb 4, 2004"}
