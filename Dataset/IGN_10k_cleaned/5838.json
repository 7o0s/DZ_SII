Thankfully, the guys at Frontier seem to have put their collective nose to the grindstone to knock out most of the problems. With the addition of the first expansion, named RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Soaked!, the RCT series moves into new territory by allowing players to craft their own water parks. Not only can pools and waterslides complete a park, but new additions like tunnels, laser shows, and whale shows make for some interesting new park designs.   At the heart of things, RCT3 remains the same, even with the addition of Soaked!. It's still about creating a park that the peeps (simulated park guests) will enjoy, hopefully losening their grips on their wallets and fattening yours. What Soaked! does is simply increase the number of things you can do, especially when dealing with water.   Water parks are one of the last vestiges of park bound entertainment that had managed to escape the eyes of Chris Sawyer and Frontier up until now. The implementation of water parks is pretty good here. Pool complexes make up the basis for a water park section. One or more entrances (called locker rooms) can be placed around the edges of the pool complex and will allow peeps to come in and out whenever they wish. These locker rooms also house the pool cleaning agent, which your repairmen will have to refill from time to time. Honestly though, it takes a long damn time for the pool to get dirty, even when setting the inspection time to never. Along with that, a lot of the park guests didn't really seem to care how dirty the pool was. They just kept on frolicking in water the game itself describes as ~disgusting.~   Each complex has a singular charge to use all of the facilities included. Spas, diving boards, water slides, lazy rivers, and everything else will be included in that charge. So, as you would expect, the more cool things you place in a pool area for the peeps to enjoy, the more they'll be willing to pay to get in. Having peeps pay to get in at 20 dollars a head (assuming the complex is nice enough) generates cash pretty quickly considering a good pool will have at least a hundred peeps in it at all times.   Eventually they'll need to grab some food or use the bathroom so they'll need to leave the pool complex, opening it up to charge them again to get back in. On that note though, it is a little strange that food stands or merchandise stands like sunscreen can't be added onto the pool complexes. It makes sense that these bathing suit clad peeps would be able to purchase pool toys, sunscreen, and bathing suits inside of the pool complex, especially considering once peeps are in a pool complex, they aren't spending money.     In fact, nothing but those things specifically tied to a pool complex (things like loungers, umbrellas, diving boards, and pool lights) can't be placed inside. This unfortunately includes things like lamps, benches, scenery, and so on. There has to be some serious planning to accommodate statues and whatnot that you want to perk up your park. It's also a wonder that the surface of the pool complex can't be changed at all. Pathways and terrain have options to look different, so why is there no option to color cement or replace it with wood, tile, or rubber flooring. Instead, we're left with plain gray cement which is a little disappointing.   It's especially surprising given the degree that these pool complexes can be modified otherwise. Creating multi-level pools with walkways between them, spiral staircases to help conserve space and get peeps from level to level faster, and four different options for pool shape pieces allowing for some good variety even in basic pools is easy as pie. You can create some wonderfully bizarre pool structures that will have your peeps exploring for a while. Combining the pools with crazy waterslides is even more fun. The only problem with creating water slides is that you must connect the end to a pool. If the end point is too high so that peeps drop too far into a pool, the park inspector will close down the slide. Likewise, if you create a slide that launches your peeps across the park and into a pool hundreds of feet away, he'll shut it down. I really want to fire that guy because the peeps sure seem like they're having fun flying across the map to land in some far away pool.    Aside from the pools, there are several other additions dealing with the wide world of water. These include aquariums (which basically act as rides, though don't expect to use the coaster cam to see what they see because it doesn't really work), whale and dolphin shows, water shooters, water shows, those jumping water thingies everyone loved so much from the first RCT, waterfalls (very easy to create), and new rides and coasters including one that dumps water on peeps as it goes. All of the additions to the game are obviously welcome. It's always great to have new things to play with in order to fill the park out.   Those people that are really into building up show areas for fireworks and the like will have a lot of great new tools to play with. Firework shows can now be teamed up with laser shows and water shows to create a large spectacle of entertaining devices. Each of these shows can be completely customized including direction and timing and all three events can be placed in the same mixmaster string to time events perfectly. Lastly, whale and dolphin shows can also be tied into mixmaster strings so that whale jumps, dips and dives can be accompanied by firework, water, or lasers. Those willing to spend the time can have some pretty fantastic additions to their parks.   Thankfully, Frontier also took the time to add tunnels into the game. This is something that those of us that played the original RCT really missed. They're thankfully back and now players can have their zig zagging mine cart coasters coming in and out of the side of a mountain. The only unfortunate thing is that tunnels still require a vertically flat surface in the landscape to create a tunnel. It's not the worst thing in the world, but eventually it would be great to have tunnels be able to go directly into whatever slope is there. Until then, this will do nicely.   The other unfortunate thing, which I had thought was going to be included, are the underwater tunnels for coasters. I was hoping to have a coaster surrounded by some sort of clear tunnel dip into the water for further underwater adventures, but that's not the case. Players will be able to create underwater walkways, but no coasters.      Graphically, the game looks pretty much the same. Water effects are nice, though there are some real problems with lighting in the game, especially on underwater lights. You can see each square tile under the water when the lights turn on at night. It's pretty ugly and mars an otherwise lovely nighttime festival of lights. Along the same lines, disgusting water doesn't really look disgusting. At most it looks a shade dirtier, but I can't decide whether I'm just fooling myself into thinking that. Otherwise the game still looks very good. Those with lower grade machines are still going to have a hard time getting the game to run at top detail however. RCT3 can be a serious resource hog.RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Soaked! is a nice addition to the franchise. Creating water parks is easy and fun, though I would have liked a few more options for decor. Tunnels are thankfully included for those that like to truly intertwine their coasters with the landscape as well. There are some things I would have like to have seen done differently, but the additions there are mostly solid and there are a lot of them. Frontier has done a good job with this expansion and fans of the series will want to look into adding it to their collection.", "date": "Jun 21, 2005"}
