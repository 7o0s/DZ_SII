Anyone over 20 years old will usually get excited at games remade or emulated from arcade games of the 80s probably because they somehow remind us how days at the theme park used to seem to last forever. It's a relatively simple formula: Take a favorite toy from our past and computerize it, and we're in heaven.  This can, however, be a well-concealed trap. Previous 3DO Army Men games have tried to capture that feeling by giving us a bucket of army guys to fight wars with. Sadly, while these games may have struck a twangy chord of nostalgia, they seemed to fail at actually being fun. Appeal to nostalgia all you want, but if the game itself isn't fun, then you might as well have not wasted our time and yours.  But undaunted by past games, 3DO plowed on and created Army Men RTS, and luckily for both of us, they got it right this time. They made a fun game throwing together the engrossing nature of an RTS and the backyard, kitchen table army men games one would play as a child. With engrossing art (and a movable camera that allows you to get close up to some more bizarre obstacles -- like a rotting apple outside or a rubber ducky in the bathroom) and a solid RTS, Army Men is sure to amuse and engross you.  If you compare this Army Men game with previous Army Men attempts, it's very clear which one comes out on top. However, if you compare Army Men RTS with other RTS games, hardcore strategy gamers might find it a bit lacking. The game goes back to a simpler time in the world of real-time strategy, as your green platoon has only two resources to gather: plastic and electricity. Your units also have a limited movement command, with move and attack being the only actions most of your units can handle. When my base would be attacked with my guys standing just out of view, I sorely missed the ~patrol~ command, and when they would charge into battle where they were horribly outnumbered, I could have used a good old ~stand ground~ command that would keep them safe. But even though it's simpler than current RTS games, there is little fun lost because of it.  The game is based on a simple premise: your green army men fight the tan army men. Your overall goal is to eliminate a former green solider that has gone mad and procured a bucket of paint and gone tan. Methinks the designers were a little into Heart of Darkness and the picture of the tan soldier sitting on a throne with a lollipop as a scepter is priceless. There's not much more plot than that but not much more is needed, honestly. When we staged elaborate battles on our lawns, in our childhood bedrooms, and even on our bathroom counters, we needed no more reason than that. The Greens were good. The Tans were bad -- even Tans that were formerly Greens.  The art design guys had a blast with this game, that's for sure. The detail in the messy house is a refreshing change from RTS games that give us trees, rocks and hills to maneuver around. Heavily detailed flying disks, watches, toothpaste tubes, potato chips, furniture and a massive scary spider all add to the feeling that you are crouched on the ground, trying to lead your army men into battle in unfamiliar territory. The thrill of running across a water gun or a dog's chew toy or measuring cups in the kitchen, and realizing you can gather resources from it, is testament that the art is doing what it's supposed to. The dichotomy of acknowledging the seriousness of war while running your squads underneath a skateboard, hiding them behind rotting apple and gathering resources from a dog's bowl makes for amusing play. The details in creating the world, from your headquarters being a buried soda can to the resource depot strongly resembling a blender are very well thought out. I especially liked the barbed wire posts made of little pencils.    Like other RTS games, the generic units and the heroes have a variety of things to say as you're commanding them. The heroes' personalities come out with their comments (the minesweeper, Hoover, is a nervous wimp while the guy named ~Thick~ is about as smart as you'd expect). Unit and vehicle sound is realistic enough for plastic war buffs, and the music, while not standing out, makes for good background as you plan your attack.  What did you think of Army Men RTS?  The resource management is refreshingly unique. The common way to gather resources is siphoning plastic and electricity from discarded toys, flying discs, batteries and watches, even poor Killer's food bowl. But that isn't the cool part. The designers remembered that these weren't people to be reduced to a red smear on the battlefield. They're plastic. When animated plastic dies, it stays plastic, it just doesn't animate anymore. You can recover the little blobs of plastic left by dead soldiers and destroyed building. As a furious micro-manager, I was thrilled with the efficiency of the system. You can also melt down your useless buildings (say a resource depot near depleted resources) for more plastic. I will have to add here that I would have preferred my dump trucks to not wander into the battlefield gathering plastic when the measuring cups are depleted. These strangely suicidal tendencies worry me. Still, their heads are made of plastic...  The different levels have a good amount of variety within them. While the classic ~gather resources, build base, build units, upgrade units, kill enemy~ game style is there, they also give you a handful of heroes and require them to do a mission alone, fighting Tans as well as pests like ants and cockroaches. Each level has medal objectives. If you finish the level, then you get a bronze medal. However, there are voluntary goals to accomplish for better medals, things such as finishing within a time limit, killing all Tans or bugs, keeping your heroes alive, or finding all of the power-ups. Power-ups such as Full Heath and Weapons Upgrade are hidden around the map, and almost always worth the finding.  The previous Army Men games seemed to have missed the mark but with Army Men RTS, 3DO caught a winner. Army Men RTS has hit on something -- it's serious, it's primal, it's wacky and it's fun, all at once. You get all the fun of RTS fundamentals combined with the kitsch appeal of plastic soldiers.", "date": "May 9, 2002"}
