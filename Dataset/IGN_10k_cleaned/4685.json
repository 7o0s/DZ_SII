However, the brand that swallowed millions of hours of free time (and likely productivity, too) has had a harder time snaring a console audience. Can a mobile game bearing the franchise's name overcome those hurdles?   Probably, since it vaguely resembles any EverQuest game you've seen.   Features:   Sequel to Hero's Call  Hundreds of unique items  New weapons  Use magic when force won't do   The original Hero's Call was actually a pretty solid little RPG for the handset. It certainly didn't look the part of an EverQuest game, nor did it have any online play -- you know, the hallmark feature of the franchise -- but it had enough hooks to be included in the EQ oeuvre. It took place in Norrath and the monsters were of the same breeds.   Hero's Call 2 follows in the footsteps of its original. Probably a little too much for its own good. There seems to be little evolution between the two chapters. The game screen looks roughly the same, the dungeons look similar, and the monsters seem to be cut from the same cloth.   So, what are the changes? Well, technically, the dungeons are laid out differently. But the major changes are in the weapon and magic departments. You have access to new weapons and spells -- powerful magic that strikes fear, blindness, and confusion into your enemies.   But other than that, we were reeling from a bad case of deja vu. Other than new weapon names (because it's not like you can really see your little avatar carrying them all that well) and spells, this game has little aspirations to advance the ball. And if you've already played Hero's Call, then defending Norrath with a different axe might not be the best way to fatten your phone bill.   However, for newcomers, Hero's Call 2 is a decent adventure. You wander mazes and dungeons, slaying little monsters by walking up to them and pressing an ~action~ button. Beating a dungeon usually gives you enough gold to head aboveground and buy new items, making future dungeons a little easier to survive -- and you'll need the help because the beasts are no push-overs. Fortunately, you can access sub-screens that detail monsters -- their names, their powers, and personal stats. Should you get roughed up, just find a quiet corner and allow your health to regenerate.   Between action elements, the game's story plays out through dialogue screens that have a touch of irreverence. Chances are, you'll just skip these get back into the hacking and slashing parts.   As we mentioned, Hero's Call 2 looks quite similar to the original. There does seem to be a few improvements here and there, such as some additional detail to your character and some monsters -- but for the most part, the games obviously share the same tech. This isn't to say the game looks bad. It doesn't. But considering what's available on phones now, Hero's Call 2's average-ness just doesn't play that well. You know that Sony can do more. Come on, they're Sony.Hero's Call 2 is by no means a bad game -- it just doesn't advance the ball, at all. If you have zero exposure to the original, though, this is a good download. The action/RPG elements play out solidly and you can easily find a good dozen hours of enjoyment. But if you are looking for a serious EverQuest game, you're in for some disappointment. Hero's Call 2 is EQ in spirit only.", "date": "May 1, 2004"}
