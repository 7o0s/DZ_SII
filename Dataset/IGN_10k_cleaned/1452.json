If it's a complete revision with absolutely none of the joy gone, not even a drop, then it's a success. Change too much, though, and you're dead. Except for Monkey Island. Fans of Monkey Island could see the game in old pixilated form forever, and never squeak a word of complaint towards their sacred (monkey) idol. Even the last Monkey Island island game, while providing great dialogue and some fine-tuned animation, still had some surly fans complaining that the long n' tall Guybrush wasn't ~Monkey Island~ enough, when compared to earlier versions. Whatever. The point here is that LucasArts has traditionally kept the Monkey Island series intact in terms of style and flavor while making minor updates, and you'll be happy to know that the latest game does just that.  That being said, you may not be overjoyed at the fact that the engine has been revamped to chuck out the mouse interface altogether, replacing it with a gamepad/keyboard control scheme similar to Grim Fandango. By walking around the environment, Guybrush's eyes will peek at different areas on the screen, and options will appear at the bottom. Different keys will have him interact with the objects in various ways, with one default button providing the recommended action. In other words, Guybrush will cruise by a window, and the default option will be ~look through window,~ but you can also use the window, or open your inventory and use the window with one of your items. Simple stuff. Of course, it does make it annoying at times, especially when you have to turn Guybrush back and forth to get a specific option to pop back up. Just think of it as the modern equivalent of a mouseover in adventure games, and you'll be fine.  Of course, control is nothing when it comes to Monkey Island -- this is an adventure game at its heart, which means it's really all about the story. I'm not going to ruin anything for you (but if you're interested, you can check out the first impressions for a lil' more info), only to say that the mixture of incredibly modern humor in the Pirate setting is just as funny as ever. Family oriented theme restaurants replacing pirate towns, corporate takeovers, and bureaucratic idiocy are the themes of Escape From Monkey Island, and they're just as funny as earlier adventures in the game. It's even more surprising, given the fact that the game is being crafted by a new team (the key members, anyway).  Along with the humor though, you'll have the puzzles. Insult attacks, bizarre code references so obscure that you'll be groaning with their solution, they're all here. The game is right on par with the other adventures in terms of obscure puzzle problems, but there are some times where even the best adventure gamer will have himself smacking his head in disbelief at the leaps in logic the development team has you making in order to progress through the game. Basically, if you were frustrated with some of the more obscure puzzles in Grim Fandango, you'll be frustrated here. If you can deal with that, then you'll find yourself with a fun adventure, peppered with a few skull-cracking moments. Of course, any adventure gamer worth their salt will be familiar with this *cough* use candlestick with the rug on door *cough* type of gameplay.  Of course, the biggest gripe that any fan's going to have is with the move to 3D. Yes, this means that the more bizarre characters don't translate nearly as well in 3D as they 2D, but on the other hand, animations and voice-sync are much, much better than previous versions of the game. While Guybrush may not look as vibrant as you're used to, he moves and talks with enough charm to make you forget that he used to be created in Photoshop instead of a 3D modeler. The backgrounds do a great job of mimicking the 2D backdrops of earlier versions as well, though things do get confusing at times trying to figure out how sections of the map meet, or getting your character turned in the right direction when you head out too far in the distance. Again, it goes back to control. 2D limited how much space you had to interact with in the environment, but 3D puts you in the horrible Resident Evil camera bracket, meaning that there are times when a camera won't zoom in when you want it to, or will zoom in to a chunky angle when you weren't even near the building. You'll get used to it, but at times it will make you twinge for something a little more old school.  The voice acting is as tight as ever, with Monkey Island reclaiming the throne for best voices in a game. LucasArts obviously spends some good time and money on their voices, and it shows. Listen to the bank teller talk about her pop career, and you'll realize just how great the caricatures are in the game, from main heroes to cameos. The music is nearly identical to the last game, with the steel drum and jazzy backbeats providing a light hearted background to the special events and key moments in the game. It's definitely in the ~if it ain't broke don't fix it~ vein, but then again, if it ain't broke...  So the game's great, the story's funny, and it's another monkey-themed adventure. End of story. Well, except for the bugs... and there are bugs, let me tell you. A few of us here at work have been playing the game, and have encountered a variety of problems, from simple hard crashes to annoying subtitle errors, where you'll be in a conversation tree with a character, but not able to actually see your options. I also had similar problems when it came to objects -- there were times when I knew I could interact with objects near me, and Guybrush's head would veer over towards the object... but nothing would appear at the bottom of the screen. I'd come back later, and the options would be back, and ready for business. At times this would keep me from solving important puzzles, which made for some frustrating gameplay. Also, the game tends to run choppy at times, which is odd given that the backgrounds are pretty much static. Characters will speed up and slow down for moments when going through in-game cutscenes, or through complicated animations, and while it's far from horrible, it can definitely get annoying. While the glitches aren't as major as some games, it's still sad to see the game rushed out the door with problems that might've been fixed easily with just a little more time.  What EFMI ends up feeling like is a highly honed episode of your favorite show. Old characters reappear, relationships are fleshed out in even more humorous detail, and old locations are brought back for your joy and giggles. While the glitches are definitely frustrating, and the polish is lacking at times, overall this is a welcome return to the eeps and oops of your childhood.   -- Vincent Lopez      Want to share your opinions with the world?
