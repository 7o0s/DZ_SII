Below average, sub-par, sure, we can accept that -- nobody's perfect. But when you take the developer responsible for Tomb Raider, one the biggest phenoms in videogame history, and pair it with the most powerful console currently available and still can't produce a redeemable product, you have yourself some problems. Fighting Force 2 is that problem.   Granted, the first game for Nintendo 64 and PlayStation wasn't that good either. A mindless, button-mashing rental at best, the original Fighting Force left me thoroughly unimpressed. What's worse is that I secretly wished it to be one the better games of 1997. A longtime fan of legendary beat 'em ups like Final Fight, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, I was looking forward to Fighting Force. After all, with a distinct lack of games in the genre, I had hoped it could recapture my imagination. Unfortunately, my wish didn't come true.   So here it is just over two years later, and Core and Eidos once again take their stab at the ~lone bad-ass with fists~ genus. On the plus side, there have been some big improvements in console titles over the last two years, which left me to hope that this sequel would easily overshadow the original -- besides, how could it not? Sadly, I was wrong.   Even a group huddle can't save this replay. There are so many uninspiring aspects of Fighting Force 2 that I don't know where to start. I suppose it should be with the main character, Hawk Manson. Apparently borrowing his look from Duke Nukem, Hawk fits the part of vigilante pretty well. Unfortunately, his ability set consists of only a handful of moves. Yes, martial arts fans, you can jump, punch, and kick with little variation and that's about it. Of course you can pick up various weapons throughout the game (axes, guns, and the like), but for the most part they aren't any more effective you're your fists. Talk about disappointing.   Also disappointing are the enemies. Pretty much the same couple of guys in different colored clothes, you run into the same idiotic bastards throughout the ~adventure.~ What's worse is that they all have the constitution of a Bad Dudes crony. Nail a guy two or three times with your mighty foot 'o destruction and he's a pretty much goner. It doesn't matter what level you're on or how many enemies there are, If it moves, you can abolish it in seconds. Not really fun.   The only time I had actually difficulty pummeling a foe, was when I was trying to put him in my line of sight. Using a modification of the popular Tomb Raider engine and its overhead view, the game's camera is an exercise in frustration. No matter which pad you use (analog or digital) turning around to look at something behind you without your point of view drifting off in one direction or another is almost guaranteed.   Speaking of the camera, it clips like a hairdresser. Constantly trying to adjust itself so that you can see the onscreen action, it commonly creeps into a nearby wall to produce that all too familiar ~through the dirty looking glass~ view we grew accustomed to in the early PlayStation days. At least what you can see is fairly attractive. The graphics are by far the only saving grace I found here (and even those are occasionally marred by shadows so dark, finding your way through a stage can be trying).   Also to the game's credit, most of the surrounding objects are interactive, and can be examined or destroyed. Strangely though, whenever you hit something it blows up Die Hard style. Huh? I don't know about you, but I haven't run into too many exploding air vents in my time... but that's just me.I walk away from Fighting Force 2 thinking about what it could have been, instead of what it is. Flawed, unentertaining, and a step backward for fans looking to recapture Final Fight's magical gameplay -- you can definitely find much better than this.", "date": "Jan 12, 2000"}
