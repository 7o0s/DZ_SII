Its latest arcade game, Radar Scope, was a flop. It was boring and derivative. It was sinking NOA's ship -- almost literally. It was 1981, and thousands of Radar Scope upright cabinets were being delivered by sea, traveling to the then-headquarters of Nintendo's American arm in New York.   As they made the journey to and through the Panama Canal, the company was in a quandary. It needed a new game, and it needed it quickly. Its bank accounts draining, there wasn't enough time to come up with an all-new product, pack and ship it from Japan. The company would have to use what it had -- thousands of machines of Radar Scope. It'd have to improve the stinker.   A young man named Shigeru Miyamoto had been working at Nintendo in Japan. He hadn't been there long, and hadn't had much chance yet to show his quality. He got it with Radar Scope. Called into the office of President Hiroshi Yamauchi, the young Shigeru was tasked with improving the game. He accepted, looked at what he had to work with, and promptly threw it out.   Shigeru started from scratch, designing an all-new game that could be installed as a retrofit on the Radar Scope board. Popeye was his inspiration, as he sought to create a game starring the spinach-swallowing sailor saving his sweetheart Olive Oil from the brutish bully Bluto. The license, though, was unavailable. Nintendo was unproven. Miyamoto changed his cast -- Olive Oil became Pauline, the damsel in distress. Popeye became a short and squatty hero in a red cap, called Jumpman. And Bluto he changed into an ape -- consulting an English Japanese dictionary to find the right way to say ~stubborn monkey,~ he ended up with the name Donkey Kong.   Donkey Kong created an all-new genre -- the platformer. Arcades of the day were filled with space shooters or maze chases, but this game was different. Here, players ran, climbed, and jumped. It was a totally fresh experience, guiding the hero along fractured girders and broken ladders, jumping over barrels and wielding a giant mallet to eliminate enemies. Some of the environments even had moving parts -- elevators and conveyor belts that added further novelty to the experience.   It was like no game to ever come before and the rest is history. Though NOA's employees were skeptical of the game, it installed and modified the Radar Scope cabinets into Donkey Kong machines and the game became a hit. Second in popularity only to Pac-Man at its height, Donkey Kong went on to inspire merchandising, sequels and even a cartoon show. The character Jumpman was later renamed and is better known today as Mario, a mascot who has gone on to have some moderate level of success for Nintendo himself.   Donkey Kong was Nintendo's first big hit. It established the company's name and provided its foundation. It introduced the company's most important mascot character, without whom it would never have achieved the success and longevity enjoyed in the ensuing 25 years. And its design still holds up today. Playing DK on a great, nostalgic experience -- it controls well and you can see the excellence of Miyamoto's early work shining through in the smallest details.   There's a lot of fun still to be had with this grand gorilla. And looking back on the company's history, Donkey Kong is arguably Nintendo's most important game.   But be warned.   Be warned because this isn't the true Donkey Kong. The NES version of the arcade classic isn't quite as good as what inspired it. Whereas the coin-op original had four full levels of play, the NES conversion only has three -- it's only 75% complete. On top of that, the opening cutscene -- where DK climbs the first stage and stomps the girders into place -- is removed. The interstitial animations between stages -- removed. The final scene, with Jumpman rescuing Pauline and DK crashing to the ground below, is there at least, but nothing else is. That's kind of a big deal; since Donkey Kong was the first ever game to contain a full narrative, telling a story with a beginning, middle and end. Books have been written on this subject, I kid you not. The original, true Donkey Kong is the better game. The game that saved Nintendo from bankruptcy is the same game that kept the company from drowning in thousands of unmarketable arcade cabinets. Give us the real Donkey Kong, Nintendo, not an incomplete port, that while inspired, just isn't the same.", "date": "Dec 1, 2006"}
