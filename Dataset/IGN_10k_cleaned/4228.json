It wasn't exactly the deepest gameplay experience that has ever been released to stores, but it certainly had its moments. Nearly a year and half later, getting back into Dungeon Siege and it's hands-off style of gameplay wasn't nearly as magical, moody, or fun as I may have hoped it would be back in the day. This is partly because the wonder of the engine and the immersive trance Dungeon Siege cast over me has faded. But it's mostly because this expansion pack, Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna, is plainly average and tends to bring the faults of the parent game to the forefront without being able to hide them under slick layers of production and ambiance.   Dungeon Siege was an interesting title. It provided a very detailed environment full of monsters and action that used an engine that never had to load a new map throughout the entire experience. But at the same time it took away most of the gameplay and control from the player and put it in the hands of the friendly AI so that players were left watching the action more than playing it. I know that I gave more commands to smash the millions of boxes and barrels found sitting out in the wilderness and the dank corners of rotting dungeons than I did in actual combat. For while strategy can play a part in some encounters, there's often very little need for it, aside from deciding when to use certain spells and potions. I suppose there was enough action happening on screen that it could end up fooling players into thinking that they were doing more than they actually were.   And Legends of Aranna has really done nothing to change any of this. At its core, it's the exact same game that was released a year and a half ago, only with a new (yet somehow predictably old) story, some new monsters, new spells, new items, and new friendly races. Along with this new content there have been numerous additions to the interface to make some bits of gameplay easier to deal with, such as being able to redistribute potions among all players, sort inventory easily, and assign setups to your units including spells that aren't currently active in the spell book. All of these additions really are nice, but they also all strike me as things that should have been addressed in patches.     Instead of opting for a high level campaign that might have challenged veteran players' characters a bit, a new campaign and story has been developed for characters that are just taking their first steps and beginning to think about making the move away from training diapers. It's almost a bit strange considering the package actually comes with the original Dungeon Siege as well (which I always like to see), but also understandable for those that would want another adventure but didn't bother to keep their old characters.   No one will be surprised to hear that the story involves a big bad evil that has escaped the clutches of its jail keepers in order to get revenge and then bring his thousands of years of pent up frustration to the world at large. It's a story that's been done so many times with so many faces it's beginning to resemble some kind of fantastic Joan Rivers. The ~story~ is told through pieces of history and plot picked up from NPCs, books, and journals found throughout the game. The history you find is an interesting one. The Utraeans were a very scientific race that believed themselves to be just about best things ever to set foot on the planet. And being the humble servants of nature that they were, they decided that manual labor was a bit below their stature. Therefore, the Utraeans used their magic and science to turn some of the natural fauna into their own bigger and more intelligent household help. Turns out the Utraeans created their creatures with a few more brains than they intended. The beasties rose up in defiance, destroying both their masters' beloved cities and the civilization that kept them in chains. D'oh. But that's the way of things when you play God. In any case, the game takes place on the island where this whole mess went down. It's a nice tropical place for much of the journey, but comes complete with mountains, swamps, and more just to make sure there's some variety, even though the variety is of the same sort that was already in the original Dungeon Siege.   Once again, your own character has about as little an identity as there can be while still being an actual character and not a faceless NPC. There's almost zero connection to you and your party of characters. The only interaction you ever get on a personal basis is the conversation that takes place before they join. I never felt bad about replacing one of them with a new character that was more advanced (which they always seemed to be) because I never got attached. Who cares if they die? I don't. Actually, scratch that, I didn't ever replace my stalwart pack animal (considered one of the group), and I did care if it died simply because it was so cute. It had more personality in its run than the rest of the characters with their mediocre voiceovers combined.    Your job in the story will be to find the big bad evil known as the Shadowjumper in order to give him a good throttling and help any people you find on the way with their quests, which will all happen to fall right in line with your main objective. This creates an extraordinarily linear experience and eliminates the need for pesky exploration, which is usually the hallmark of a good RPG, even an action oriented one like Dungeon Siege. This is definitely one of the reasons that the game lacks any kind of oomph that RPGs can usually deliver story-wise. Part of the plot is discovering what happened to the main hero's long departed parents, who also happened to be adventurers. This seems like a great opportunity for a bit of clue hunting and exploration (maybe even some problem solving?) and a great opportunity to make the character more fleshed out and believable, but it's never taken advantage of. Instead, you'll just happen along bits of info about the parents along the way, making the whole idea more an offhand interest than anything important.   Substituting for story and exploration is the opportunity to drown the world in a sea of blood. Thousands of monsters, including a few new ones (though not as many as I would have like to have seen after a year and a half), will block your every step. But once again, the combat in is less than spectacular as it moves players from the better position of coach and strategist to general manager in charge of inventory.    Dungeon Siege's friendly AI is good enough now that there is very little need to direct characters around on the screen. They'll pick targets, attack them, and kill them, all quick enough and chaotic enough that it's incredibly hard to really figure out what you should be doing differently. Better yet, once you have a group that's big enough and powerful enough, there's hardly any reason to think about it as they'll wade through throngs of seemingly ravenous enemies without hesitation. The fact that there is a pause feature in the game makes it seem like you should be pausing and giving orders, but I didn't use the feature once during this recent experience and only one of my characters managed to die.      All I had to do was set my characters into motion and watch them do everything while managing use of health and mana potions and sometimes switch between spells. Every now and again, I'd tell them to attack a specific enemy just for kicks (actually there was at least one instance where attacking certain enemies first was important), but for the most part, most of my pointing and clicking revolve around destroying boxes, opening chests, and deciding what loot (which is mostly too much and too similar to care) to pick up. I think that's boring. I know there are some of you out there that live for picking through a bunch of crap to find a sword that does 856 damage instead of 850, but I do not.   Legends of Aranna also hands out a few new spells and items to keep the treasure hunters happy and satiated, but they're few enough and unspectacular when they are there. After so long, you would figure on something bigger and better than what's in this package hoping to get people back into the experience. Instead we have decidedly average additions.Dungeon Siege fans that are just looking for another land to run through in order to slaughter masses of maddened monsters will find exactly what they're looking for. Legends of Aranna doesn't add enough new content or new ideas to mark it as a good expansion, but doesn't skimp enough to really call foul and give the developers the finger either.The game still looks good (though not as good compared to other titles nowadays), but that's just not enough to vault it past being an average gameplay experience. The story and voicework in the game don't really help the situation either. The problem is, you can see the potential just sitting there, but somehow it seems hopelessly beyond reach, behind some indestructible bars. Hopefully Gas Powered Games will be able to break the lock with Dungeon Siege II.", "date": "Nov 19, 2003"}
