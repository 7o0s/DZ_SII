If you have even the measliest of imaginations, Starsky and Hutch easily lends itself to the medium. It's got all the ingredients: really, heavy American muscle cars, a buddy cop team, one blond, one brunette, and a filthy underworld of urban drug dealers and corrupt people trying to get ahead in the harsh, darkened post '60s landscape.    Only thing is, despite my sentimentality for it, even I hardly remember Starsky and Hutch, and I watched the original showings when I was a like 10 (yes, I'm older than you). I loved that show. I'll never forget the cool orange '76 Ford Gran Torino with that white bolt slicing down its side, the screeching powerslides across the empty urban streets of wherever the hell it was, and of course, the mellow cat we all know as Huggy Bear. But, two questions come to my mind when I recall the series: Is it really worth bringing them back? And, what exactly has developer Mind's Eye done with this game?    Gameplay, Graphics, Sound, and Huggy Bear too  Let's look at answering these questions. Created in the same vein as Driver, Midnight Club and to a certain extent Grand Theft Auto, Starsky and Hutch is a cops-and-robbers game that gives players four large urban areas in which to drive. Players find themselves engaging in either Story or Free Roam mode, and once opened up, TV Special mini games. There is an excellent two-player mode, but more on that later.   The Story mode is the heart of the game, leading players down a made-for-TV formula that isn't worth repeating here. Free Roam is a timeless, exploratory romp, enabling players to drive around at their leisure in the fully inhabited landscape of Bay City. Unfortunately in Story mode, the open city isn't used well, and given the game's TV ratings structure, Starsky and Hutch never comes close to mimicking any of the aforementioned games.   The hooks here, however few there may be, are unique. In Story mode players follow a set of criminal activities that lead to something much bigger, but mostly gamers shoot and drive, shoot and drive. The driving-shooting mechanism isn't half bad. The left analog steers the Torino (or should I say Starsky steers) while the right trigger accelerates and the A button enables players to shoot (that would be Hutch leaning out the window and slinging lead). Players can shoot at anything, but the screen is filled with icons onto which the gun reticule is auto-locked. The range of stuff is quite ferocious. There are car health items, such as tires, 2X icons, the enemies themselves, upgradeable weapons (shotguns, etc.), and specialty items for unlocking cool extra footage, interviews, still shots and more.    Once an enemy is targeted, the icon narrows in size and turns from yellow to red, indicating a causal hit (yellow) or a direct hit (red). It takes time for the aiming icon to turn red, and given the relatively large quantity of stuff to shoot at (oh yeah, I forgot a few, street lights, crates, barrels, standing enemies, etc.), a frenetic gameplay formula is formed.      There's one big interesting hitch, which is the TV rating. In the upper left-hand screen, a meter measures how well the show, Starsky and Hutch, is doing on...TV. To stay on the air, which is the goal, mind you, players must stick close to their targets, refrain from damaging city property, and blow up the enemies before they reach their target. Players earn rating points by performing numerous stunts such as jumps, triggered events (many of which are set in slow-motion cutscenes), pulling off huge powerslides or by nailing icons. Keep the ratings up high to score big with the fans and you'll stay on air. Drive a dull, boring mission and you get the boot. Once players get into it, there is a certain rhythm, a kind of subconscious lock-on arcade play here that's quite engaging, quite endearing.   Of course, the game ultimately descends into repetition and simplicity, twitchy blasting and annoying enemies. It's also cramped by a dull, witless story and the dialog is so cheesy it kinda stabs at you. The game suffers from all sorts of maladies, to be honest. For instance, it offers an inconsistent framerate, which sometimes runs at a crisp 30, but then sometimes acts like a bad drug trip, slowing down to 10 or 15 and chugging like an old locomotive running on spoiled plantains or a blue wheatgrass and seaweed milkshake. Even the cutscenes have slowdown.   The cityscape pops in on a regular basis and sometimes the game just crashes. In one episode (I'm not sure what this was, a bug or just plain craziness), I got slammed on top of a moving train. The car was upside down on the train, and it just sat there. When your car does this, the default mechanism is to turn it right side up again, and the player just waits for it to happen. Here, the car just sat on its roof and took a train ride for about 10 seconds until, thankfully, it finally slid off on its own accord. In an in-game cutscene, players can see square see-through polygons around the wheels of a car that were never cut out. It's pretty amazing this game got through rigorous testing.    On can argue this point back and forth, but the aiming system, since it's automatic, doesn't give players the ability to quickly select the icons they want. Instead they have to aim the car to that icon. It's a little messy, a little simplistic and at best, it just makes one glad this game isn't being sold at full price. The enemy AI isn't necessarily hard to kill, but it's definitely wily, and oftentimes it seems like that last little stretch of its health lasts way too long. In Season 3 (there are three seasons, each with six episodes, i.e. missions) the enemy AI is just hair-raisingly annoying.   Visually and aurally, Starsky and Hutch is sub-par. It's sub-par for the PS2 and GameCube, and it's definitely sub-par for the Xbox. The game engine isn't all that great, and despite the average textures, simple graphics and whatnot, the game still manages to look old and weary. The Xbox version looks best, with smoother, rounder, less hard-edged. There is more aliasing and better coloring as well. Still, there is nothing visually special about this game. In fact, it kinda looks like the engine was created in the '70s. And though the cutscenes seemed novel at first, the still-framed, '70s-styled scenes end up being more tragic then stylistic. Once you've seen them a few times, they grow old fast.   The audio is a gas for likethree minutes. You'll hear Starsky and Hutch talking during the game, saying things like how badly one wants to east pizza or burgers, and then yelling at each other and more often than not saying something real old like ~Put the pedal to the metal~ or ~That's right, Kimosabe!~ or some such stuff. Sheesh. Basically, it's just blather. And if you liked the theme song, you're going to hear it as much as you like by playing this game.  Starsky and Hutch is an average driving-shooting game at best. It's got a little hook, the TV ratings concept, which works well and gives the game some lift. But after two or three missions, you'll find the range of missions is incredibly small, the gameplay is overly simplistic, and the style of graphics and dialog to be more of an annoyance than a cult bonus. I suggest you find those old Starsky and Hutch TV episodes and watch them again to jog your memory, cause though they were cool back in the day, they didn't age too well. This game is clearly dedicated to the most diehard Starsky and Hutch fans on the planet, and only them. Rent it if you must, but you'd be better off playing World's Scariest Police Chases, it's about as good.", "date": "Sep 28, 2004"}
