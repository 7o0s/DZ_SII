While this may not upset all that many folks, after a couple of weeks with Wilco's Hangsim, I've actually gotten pretty attached to these personal flying machines. Although they're not as powerful or fast as standard aircraft, hang-gliders, parachutes, gliders and ultralights all offer flying challenges a great deal different than the mighty jets portrayed in most high concept sims. Hangsim does a pretty good job of not only introducing players to these nimble little wings, but also giving them a chance to show off once they have the basics down.  There are four different modes available in Hangsim, each of which will appeal to a different type of pilot. First up is the Free Flight mode. Here freedom-loving pilots can grab any one of the available craft and take off into several different areas with no goals but their own entertainment. Those who are looking for a little more structure will enjoy the Challenge Mode. Here players are assigned a specific aircraft, which they must use to accomplish preset goals. Most of these goals are along the lines of, ~fly along this ridge and land here,~ or, ~make it to this point.~ Some pilots aren't happy unless they're beating someone else to a finish line. Hangsim tips their hat to this crowd in the Competition Mode. Like Challenge Mode, Competition Mode assigns players a craft and a task (or tasks), but this time around they have to do it faster than the several other (computer-controlled) fliers that are in the air at the same time do. Finally there's Fun Flight Mode, a fantasy mode that's my personal favorite. In Fun Flight, your hang-glider or ultralight is equipped with missile launchers and you're launched into the air along with a handful of other craft. I think the rest is obvious.  So what about these different craft I keep mentioning? There are a load of 'em in the game, and I've got to tell you, they all feel extremely lifelike (okay, I haven't actually been parachuting before, so I'm imagining what one feels like in real life). The biggest of the bunch is the ultralight, which due to its airplane-like wings and a handy engine, is the easiest craft in the game to take off and land. Next up are the hang-gliders. These take a lot of getting used to, but once you get the hang of 'em, you'll find that they allow you to do stunts and maneuvers that would be impossible in any other type of aircraft. With that said, I must warn you that I ran into the ground a whole lot while attempting to learn all of those tricks and maneuvers. The game has three different types of hang-gliders, each of which is geared towards a different pilot skill level. The basic Storm is excellent for beginners, offering a lot of stability and glide; the Seagull is fantastic for those who want to try a few new moves but want the assurance that the glider's two engines over; the Sensor's high maneuverability makes it great for advanced pilots (read: it'll spin really tightly when you tell it to). Hangsim also has two paragliders, the Eagle and the Spider that are also designed to appeal to different pilots, but to be honest I never really enjoyed flying either one all that much. It's not that the physics were bad, I think the model is probably quite accurate, but I would rather be performing cool loops and rolls rather than slowly floating towards the ground. I'm sure that there's quite a few of you out there who don't agree with me. Don't write me any letters. The last craft in the game is a standard Glider. This craft (called the Hawk) was one of the hardest to get the hang of, but it was a heck of a lot of fun to fly once I got the basics down. One word of warning to those of you who are going to try and land one of these powerless beauties - slow down... You're going faster than you think you are.  While I was really pleased with Hangsim's actual performance (I mean, what are you really going to compare it with?), its look and overall presentation wasn't all that great. While the models of all the different aircraft were pretty solid, the ground textures and objects were pretty bad. The effect was fine as long as you stayed away from the ground, but unlike traditional flight sims which can usually get away with this kind of cheating, pilots in Hangsim will almost always end up somewhere close to the Earth eventually. The sound was also a mixed bag, offering up sparse wind effects and a nearly constant G warning beep that made me want to kill someone after about ten seconds. I eventually turned my sound off and started enjoying the game a little bit more. The manual was pretty skimpy, but offered up a few very nice physics lessons on what makes all of these different flying machines stay in the air. I'll feel a lot better the next time someone takes me up in a paraglider.  In the end, Hangsim is a well made flight sim that seems about a year behind the flight sim development curve. That being said, it's modeling a set of aircraft that you can't get access to anywhere else. I had a great time playing through the game's various Challenge and Competition missions, but I kind of wish there had been more available in the free flight mode to keep me entertained once I had exhausted these options. If you're a real flight sim fan, and you're looking for something a little bit different, I think you should go pick up a copy of Hangsim. Its pretty cheap (EBWorld is selling it for $34.99) and it will give you a whole new set of flight tricks to sort out. With its great physics and good selection of hard to find flight models, Hangsim is really the only game in town.  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Dec 9, 1999"}
