If the game was released, say, back in the SNES days, Davis Cup Tennis for the Game Boy Advance would be a solid, basic effort in the genre. But this isn't the SNES days, and the fact that this design barely offers anything more than an average tennis engine is more than a bit disappointing. Features 142 nations Singles and doubles options Clay, carpet, and grass courts Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridge) Cartridge save Only for Game Boy Advance Davis Cup Tennis barely meets the standards for what's expected in a tennis design. In this game you've got a Tournament Mode for players who want to take a country all the way through the ranks to earn the coveted Davis Cup. For those that just want to jump in and play a few rounds, Quick Play mode offers just that...a simple one-on-one game against a computer opponent of one of three difficulty levels. And, of course, the game supports link cable for players with their own copy of the game who want to challenge their friends. But because this title hardly reaches the tennis standards established by other games in the genre, there's not really any huge reason for this game to be a cartridge in a typical GBA owner's library.  The actual tennis engine does feature an impressive use of GBA effects, from the scalable tennis players rendered at several frames of animation, to the Mode 7-style court that moves in perspective as the action moves from the left to the right. To compliment the 3D look of the engine, the designers implement accurate shadows for every sprite on the screen...right down to the benches and bushes on the sidelines. Accurate speech samples are supplied for the line judges calling the ball out-of-bounds, really giving the atmosphere a sense of realism.  Unfortunately, that's about all the positive things that can be said about Davis Cup Tennis. The gameplay is actually incredibly stale, with physics that make the ball feel like it's made out of hard plastic. The shot controls are very similar to Virtua Tennis in that timing isn't absolutely critical...as long as you're in the proper spot on a return shot, you can hold down the shot button and aim before the ball hits your racket. You have the ability to lob and stroke the ball...but you can't even pull off the standard, powerful overhead smash after rushing the net. The Davis Cup Tournament mode interface is extremely basic as well, even though the designers seemed to have focused on this mode most of all.  And it's not exactly portable friendly, either; yes, real tennis matches can go on for several minutes since a match only ends when a player wins a messload of games. This design isn't exactly handheld-friendly, and despite the game featuring a cartridge save option, Davis Cup Tennis requires players to play through a full match before they can save their progress in the tournament. There's not a whole lot that can be said about Davis Cup Tennis...it doesn't have a whole lot of gameplay options beyond the Davis Cup tournament. The actual gameplay is really just an average tennis experience; games like Mario Tennis and Virtua Tennis have risen the expectations of what should be included in a video tennis title, and the developers of Davis Cup Tennis didn't seem to do anything to keep up with the rest. With THQ's and Sega's Virtua Tennis already on the market, there really isn't a good reason to choose this one.", "date": "Oct 24, 2002"}
