While there were plenty of interesting titles at the show, there was a strong sense that we had seen nearly everything there before in one form or another. And while it's not surprising that Warlords Battlecry 3 is a lot like Warlords Battlecry 2 (that is, after all, the point of a sequel), we find ourselves impressed with the few changes that have been made but we're still left wishing that the developers had taken a few more chances or added a few state-of-the-genre updates, primarily in terms of graphics.  The series has always been known for presenting lots and lots of playable races. There are five new races in this sequel, bringing the combined total up to a billion playable races. The humans of old have been split into two distinct political factions this time, the cavalry-heavy Knights and the more generalist-minded Empire. The disease-laden Plaguelords are entirely new, as are the dinosaur-like Ssrathi and the numerous Swarm.  In addition to the interesting philosophical identities, resource requirements, tech trees and unit focus of each race, most also have some unique powers. The new insectoid Swarm are able to drain resources from the mines of other players while the Ssrathi have a giant Sun Temple that defends the area around with massive spells. Add them to the various types of dwarves, elves, orcs, and so forth in the game and you've got a fantasy setting with tremendous variety and richness.  And you can play as any of these races in the game, not just as the units you'll lead but also as the hero who represents you in the game. Creating and developing a hero is definitely one of the driving forces behind the game. There are as many classes for your hero as there are races (but not, unfortunately, as much documentation) so you can build exactly the right hero for your needs. Through the game, they'll be responsible for gaining control of resource nodes and picking up magic items. Heroes can now buy and sell magic items at new shops at certain areas and can even gather a retinue of high-level troops around them to carry with them from mission to mission.  The campaign game has a lot more direction to it this time around. While I like the Risk-style approach of the last game, the developers have jettisoned that idea in favor of a more story-driven experience that still allows the player to set their own path through the world. There are various nodes around the map and each is linked to one or more other nodes. There are story missions at most of these nodes but there are also lots of random, incidental missions you can undertake to build up your forces. Some missions will even grant you an alliance with one of the other races, allowing you to lead them into future combats if you desire.   As with the previous game it can take a while to get things rolling in terms of production. Building up even a modest force will require more than a few minutes as you locate resources and build the appropriate structures. Sadly, weak units get outclassed a bit too soon (unless you're playing one of the rush races like the Swarm). Late units take a bit too long to build as well. To actually field the largest units in the game, you may find yourself holding back from delivering the killing blow. Thankfully, the units in the middle range are fun and varied enough to provide an interesting challenge.   But there are still some definite tactical shortcomings here. For one thing, the enemy AI still seems committed to the idea that a slow and steady trickle of attackers will eventually wear down your defenses. They simply don't. I have found rare moments where the AI has run around me, trying to undercut my economic basis and there have been a few occasions where the enemy took advantage of my attention being diverted elsewhere to seize or destroy key objectives. Still, spending the first half of each game watching the enemy send individual units to take on your large guard towers is plenty annoying.      The other real gripe I have with the game is the shoddy pathfinding. Previous versions of the game have suffered from the same weakness but that makes it no less excusable here. Friendly units will split from their groups and take the long way around to particular objectives. Given the narrowness of some of the areas on the maps, making sure all of your units are where they're supposed to be becomes a challenge in itself. Luckily there's an option now to have units who are grouped together move at a single speed.  Though serviceable, the graphics for the game are just too dated to win any admirers. In fact, the graphics were dated when the previous game was released two years ago. Apart from some simple texture upgrades, it's hard to tell that anything's changed. Sure, some of the spell effects are nice and the tremendous range of structures are all rendered according to consistent styles, but the animations still leave a lot to be desired. Like queens on a chessboard, the units can only move in eight directions, making sharp turns as they move from diagonal to horizontal or vertical movement. It's a small detail but one that contributes to an overall sense of stiffness.  Things are much better in terms of sound. Though they tend to get repetitive, the unit acknowledgements are humorous and lively and the music score, though somewhat limited in scope, nevertheless accomplishes the mission of giving you something interesting to listen to without forcing you to pay too much attention to it.  Enlight provides a relatively stable multiplayer experience. We've heard some stories of various problems with the service but we haven't experienced any of them ourselves. The range of options are considerable so you ought to be able to set up just about any type of experience you'd like. Things might be a bit more convenient with dedicated lobbies for certain level ranges, but you can easily seek out opponents of similar experience with a little patience.   Let's get the d'uh factor out of the way now: Fans of the first two games will find much to love in this sequel. They'll also find that some of the shortcomings the series has been known for persist here. The pathfinding and one-man assault woes are still present and the title's graphics still leave a lot to be desired. We always say that graphics aren't as important as gameplay but they are still important.The depth of races and units in Warlords Battlecry 3 is enough to fill three other lesser RTS games. This type of detail and breadth is usually only found in historical games like Age of Empires and its spiritual descendants Rise of Nations and Empire Earth. I'm quite satisfied with the current game but next time I'd like it to be a little smarter and quite a bit prettier.", "date": "May 26, 2004"}
