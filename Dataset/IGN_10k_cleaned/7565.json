Lode Runner, a tile-based 2D puzzler of sorts, hit the home gaming market and quickly carved a niche for itself as one of the most addictive and fun titles of the time. More than a decade later Lode Runner is considered a classic -- and like many of the greats, it's been remade over and over again. While some of the past updates were pretty good, the franchise started to stray further away from what really defined the original: simple controls and mind-bending puzzles.Luckily, the latest version of the series, Lode Runner 3D does the original justice for the most part. Created by Seattle-based Big Bang Software under the watchful eye of Lode Runner creator Doug Smith, the N64 Lode Runner plays much in the same way the original did, only now the game takes place in pseudo-3D and the ladders have been eliminated.Features 8MB (64 megabit) cartridge. 3D Polygonal engine with 2D-style gameplay. Real-time tessellation of paths. Five unique game worlds, each with 20 challenging levels. Access to previously played levels. Dynamic, automatic camera controls. EEPROM saving -- no need for Memory Pak.The StoryThe rich Out-Sector Colonies are being raided by the mad Emperor Monk of Pandora. Staging from secret bases scattered throughout his home system, the Emperor has been hijacking the gold shipments that are vital to the free systems. As their economies deteriorate and massive recession threatens, the Federated Hegemonies turn to the Lode Runners.Faced with this crisis, Lode Runners Special Intelligence is soon able to recover vital access codes and navigational information from a wrecked raid ship of the Emperor's. Because of strong conventional defenses, a full fleet action would result in massive casualties, so a bold and daring plan is hatched.A lone combat cargo shuttle will enter the Emperor's system. Disguised as a rogue trade ship, it will use the captured information to infiltrate the Outer Defense Grid. Once at the enemy base, the heroic volunteer manning the ship is to enter, search for and seize the information needed to proceed deeper into the Emperor's realm. Every opportunity will be used to recover the missing gold. And if he can be found, the mad Emperor himself is to be cornered and destroyed. Thus, the adventure begins.GameplayInstead of going for the same 2D viewpoint and gameplay as the original Lode Runner, Big Bang upgraded the series with 3D graphics and a fully polygonal hero. You won't find ~go anywhere~ 3D worlds like in Super Mario 64, but rather path-based 3D environments that rotate and scroll as the player progresses the game. Players guide Lode Runner through five worlds, each with five sub-stages, containing four levels each (as well as a hidden bonus stage). The idea behind each area is to collect enough gold to reach the next. Preventing Lode Runner from achieving his goals are a number of various obstructions including objects and enemies, all of which must be dealt with in a puzzle-like manner in order to proceed.For example, supposing Lode Runner finds himself running from an enemy, one solution might be to shoot a hole through the flooring so that his assailant falls through. From there, Lode Runner can make his way beyond the enemy and to the next goal. More commonly, Lode Runner may need to place bombs precisely on the right tiles in order to make his way through before they reappear, trapping him (which results in death).Helping him on his quest are a commendable selection of handy items that perform various operations. Instead of the franchise's trademark ladders, players fill for example find the Helix Lift. Once activated, it acts as an elevator between levels; the Shuttle Disk allows Lode Runner to fly through the air; the Snow Maker creates new tiles so that Lode Runner can continue along blank passages -- and so on. Here is rundown of the most important gadgets and items found in the game: Bomb: These timed quantum imploders are capable of destroying nearby destructible tiles. Helix Lift: Using phased-helical energies, these hover lifts can elevate anyone to new heights. Jump off any time. Shuttle Disk: Moving platforms that allow you to fly through the air. Bit Launcher/Drill Bit: This robotic drill will bore through the less stable areas of the pathways. Once set in motion, it can only be destroyed by another drill bit. Cable Disk: Essentially a shuttle lift on rails. Capped Well: Vent off the magmic energy caused by the Monk's mining efforts. Don't burn your feet. Steam Lift: Exhaust gases are used for elevation power. Ice Slide: Another strange Monk transport device. Snow Maker: Create ice blocks to repair broken pathways. Ice Lift: An ice making device that can be used as an elevator. It creates a solid pillar of ice that self-destructs after a few seconds. Tele Freezer: Molecular transceivers that move around. Attack Bridge: A creature used to guard storage zones. Attacks any offending creature -- but can also be misused as a bridge. Remote Switch: Toggles some of the more nasty devices found in the storage zones. Brunswick: This crude machine drops rocks on people. Not nice. Plasma Launcher: A nuclear waste-powered booby trap.The way Lode Runner 3-D is designed, players will be introduced to these items one by one. The first levels in the game are super-easy and action fans will probably get bored of the gameplay before long. However, if you enjoy puzzle games that require you to think your way through a level, this is it. Some of the later stages are so tough to solve, you will literally jump up and shake your fist at the TV once you have come up with the solution. We don't want to give too much away, but the game effectively uses the Lode Runner-typical world mechanics (such as the timing of certain blocks ~growing back~) to test your problem solving abilities. Brilliant.On the downside, the controls feel a bit clumsy and the game's graphical presentation dates it as a first-generation title.GraphicsConsidering the fact that it's essentially a beefed-up puzzle game, Lode Runner's graphics aren't bad. Levels, which consist of series of tiles and paths formed into clever puzzles for Lode Runner to manipulate, are laid out over static backgrounds. Unfortunately, the game's engine doesn't manage to keep up with the amount of polygons that are being pushed and things slow down quite frequently. The fantasy backgrounds are imaginative, but sadly, the whole look of this game just doesn't click. As a matter of fact, had Big Bang managed to create a game with more unique graphics and a smooth game engine, Lode Runner 3-D could have been a more exciting game overall.SoundLode Runner's audio designers actually came up with a pleasant ~new age~ soundtrack and good sound effects. Like the game's graphics, the sound and music don't manage to stand out or incite excitement in the player. It's only after prolonged play that you will eventually come to appreciate the restrained soundscape as it really lets you concentrate on the game's puzzles.Peripheral SupportThe Rumble Pak is supported, but Lode Runner doesn't require the use of a Controller Pak. All data is stored internally on the built-in EEPROM. No RAM Expansion support.Although it may look like a platformer, Lode Runner 3-D is really a puzzle game. The title's gameplay mechanics -- as far as control and action go -- are fairly weak. Luckily, that's not what this game is about. Like its predecessors, LR 3-D is all about puzzles and problem solving. If you're looking for a game that will truly make you think, Lode Runner delivers. I love the fact that instead of just using the 3D graphics to make the game look better, Big Bang actually created its puzzles with 3D space in mind. On the downside, the 3D engine could have used some more work and the game's presentation is average at best (even the level select screens are slow). I would have prefered smooth 2D graphics with a multiplayer mode and a level editor over the more fancy, but slower 3D view. Overall, Lode Runner is a fun puzzle game. Unfortunately, the game's graphics date it as a first-generation title and will keep those spoiled with Nintendo and Rare-developed games from enjoying Lode Runner 3-D to its fullest. Puzzle fans should definitely take a look.", "date": "Apr 1, 1999"}
