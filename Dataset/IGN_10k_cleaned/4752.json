You were there for many a snowday back in 1985, where I spent hours upon hours cycling through the action on the Atari 7800. You were the reason I leapt onto that system, after spending large amounts of my paperroute earnings on the arcade version so many years before. And now, I have you again, in portable form. And you haven't missed a beat in the decade and a half absence.  Namco's Xevious is, by far, my all-time favorite shooter, and it's clear why: the game required a bit of thought in its action, forcing players to work on two independent planes of action to survive. Enemies swarm towards the ship in the air, and all can be taken out with a single shot from the forward blaster. But enemy forces also moved on the ground as well, and required a bit of aim and timing to nail them with a powerful torpedo. The game also used a bit of mental capacity to survive; some ground targets remained stationary, others moved, and some were just for scenery...sitting there defenseless. And in that gaming zone players would have to decide which ground targets needed to be wiped out in order to stay alive; if one target was left standing, it could let off a stray bullet that could easily take out the player's one-shot-weak ship.  Like most arcade games of the early eighties, there wasn't an ultimate goal in Xevious; it was simply a ~how high can you go~ type of action game. But that doesn't mean there wasn't any payoff deeper into the game; between areas, players face off with gigantic motherships that literally fill the screen and throw out an insane amount of firepower that'll take a lot of reflex to avoid.  The NES version, released in Japan very close to the original Atari 7800 edition, is a very, very accurate version of the classic arcade game, even in its ~widescreen~ format (the original stand-up version used a vertical screen). Graphics are as accurate as the hardware could handle, and there's nary a bit of flicker or slowdown when the screen fills up with sprites. The Classic NES Series version of Xevious perfectly emulated on the Game Boy Advance, adding a high score save to cartridge as well as link cable and Wireless Adapter support for two players...though the multiplayer is simply an alternating mode that can also be handled on one system.  The only real issue is in its automatic fire setting; by simply holding down the fire button players can simply let loose a constant stream of bombs, essentially ruining a lot of the game's challenge. And, of course, there's that Xevious element of throwing out randomly appearing bullets at the ship that are next to impossible to avoid. It was in the arcade game that's retained here, and it's simply just an unfair design element. Xevious was definitely one of my favorite games on the ill-fated Atari 7800 because it recreated the arcade incredibly well. The NES game is produced just as well, though either my reflexes have slowed down a tad or the game's just better played with a joystick due to all the wild direction changes that are required. The auto-fire element does suck and takes away the game's fun and challenge, so if you pick up this game...just don't hold the button down. You'll have a lot more fun with it.", "date": "Jun 4, 2004"}
