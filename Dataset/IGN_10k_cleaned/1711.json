It's so addictive that  once you start playing, you won't put    your controller down. Normally, the office    gets together for a Bomberman session after    work, but not anymore.     Set in seven different 3D environments    strewn with throwable objects, the game    challenges you to a match against three    other opponents armed with logs, rocks, ice    blocks, and atomic bombs. If you run out    of stuff to throw, you can toss your    opponents around too. Each hit drops your    life meter, so be careful who you pick a    fight with.      Poy Poy really becomes fun when you drag    out the multi-tap. With room for four    players on the screen at the same time,    there's a whole lot of game here. Characters    differ in size, strength, and speed, so    remember to try and pick someone that will    compliment your strategy.     In addition to multiple power-ups and    animated obstacles, you can choose from a    variety of Power Gloves. Some gloves give    the item you are tossing a higher arc, others    make stuff explode in the air causing    damage to multiple targets, and one glove in    particular turns ordinary objects into    heat-seeking projectiles. So watch out for    flaming logs!  The flat-shaded polygonal graphic style of Poy Poy may seem simple at first, but there's a method to this madness. The point here isn't to concentrate on flashy effects and textures, it's to kick the crap out of your friends! And at this, Poy Poy excels.", "date": "Sep 19, 1997"}
