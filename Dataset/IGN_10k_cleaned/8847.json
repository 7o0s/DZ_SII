You never quite know if you'll get cleated in the face. Sort of like picking up a rugby game. Console-based encounters tend to suffer in translation and accessibility. American audiences -- for the most part unfamiliar with the sport - are often thrown straight into solidly built ruggers without any means of achieving a base level of enjoyment. For the few wise enough to wear scrum caps, rugby games often gloss over nuances with clunky controls.    In preparation for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, EA Sports put forth a good effort with Rugby 08. Although it is the only option for rugby fans looking to psych themselves up for the tournament or to play as licensed teams, Rugby 08 is solid, fun, and easy.   Men in blackwill always destroy men in yellow. These burly men aren't pushovers. Quite the contrary. They have a knack for impossibly scoring with drop kicks, quickly adapting to the touted on-the-fly defensive formations, and forming solid walls on the goal line that force you to perform some creative maneuvers (or to simply bully your way to a try).    Rather, Rugby 08 offers ease of use. Its controls allow for both variety in skill and familiarity with the sport. For ruggers seeking depth, EA included a light playbook, wheeling scrums and mauls, and an arsenal of grubbers and up and unders. If you don't know what this means, don't fret. A painless tutorial preps you for jumping into the action with simple, arcade-like control. It's fast. With a few touches, you'll be scoring tries. If you're still at a loss, a practice pitch will help settle newcomers.    The tutorial does skip the finer points of how one actually plays Rugby, so those wholly unfamiliar with the sport best sit down with a rulebook.   For the most part, running the field is pure joy as your forwards stiff-arm defenders prior to face planting for a try. This is particularly true playing at club or pro difficulty - you'll dominate possession and often end up with lopsided scores against weaker teams. A few well-timed passes will send players rocketing through the opposing team's defense. Solo runs are easy to execute at mid-field where the defense is usually spread thin. But if you manage to recycle the ball after a tackle in enemy territory, you'll often face a solid wall and a likely turnover. The closer to the goal line, the harder it is to gain any ground. The elite competition is brutal.    Go for the goal. When not worried about a computer-controlled threat, you'll occasionally wrestle with controls. The triggers sensibly swing the ball to the left or right. But like most sports games, over eager tapping - due to delays recycling the ball - queues commands. Coupled with a shifting orientation (depending on your goal line), several passes will inadvertently wind up in touch. Similar problems occur with buttons that play double duty. Hammering on X to bind players to a ruck will occasionally punt away your possession.   Players can choose between simplified and advanced line out controls. The basic set up requires a mere button press to send the ball to the right rugger. Advanced controls require you to control the thrower and the jumpers independently. It's an elaborate timing exercise. It forces skill into an otherwise simple exercise, but beyond creating more opportunities for incomplete passes, it has little impact on your overall execution.    What's most likely to mess up your game is the need to anticipate tackles. Oftentimes when confronted by an oncoming defender, the ball carrier suddenly roots to the spot and is unable to pass the ball to a nearby teammate. Instead you'll have to rely on a quick action dump as the player is brought to the ground. This saps all your momentum and results in little gain. Evasive maneuvers also require an abnormally large distance between you and the defense. Shoulder charges and side steps need to be planned well in advance of impact, or you'll wind up on the grass.    This is particularly vexing since you have a limited field of awareness. Rugby 08 offers a bevy of camera options, but none provide an acceptable compromise between wide vantage point and being able to tell what's going on. You'll have to consult the radar to learn essential defense placement. Without it, there is no way of knowing whether there is someone between you and a try, or if you will punt straight into enemy hands.    Get rid of it before you die. As you'd expect, a game carrying the World Cup license allows you to take your favored team through the tournament ladders. While team management options are fairly simple - allowing you to dictate various plays and make substitutions -- there is an interesting morale component to the proceedings. Each player is assigned a morale and form statistic. These increase with individual playtime, performance, and wins. They decrease when players commit errors, ride the pine, and lose games. It forces you to rotate weaker players into early matches. If you don't, you risk losing crucial games due to injury. If an inexperienced player takes the field, team morale will plummet because no one has confidence in his abilities. It's an interesting mechanism, but its minimal implementation seems like its real purpose is to encourage active team management.   When weary of your quest for the World Cup, challenge mode makes for a nice distraction. Borrowed from 2006 FIFA World Cup, challenge mode offers a number of World Cup scenarios that will test your mettle against over-powering teams, huge score deficits, and a ticking clock.   Wrestling skills apply. Learning rugby is sink or swim. New recruits, who barely grasp the fundamentals, are often thrown straight into a match. Aimlessly running after the ball is often the fastest way to understand the game. Thats really the best way to step into Rugby 2008  learn the basics and then start playing. The various control options allow you to naturally acquire advanced techniques once youve mastered the basics. I still have a few niggling problems with the controls and the ever insufferable moments of omnipresent AI. But at the very least, Rugby 2008 will certainly tide you over until the World Cup.", "date": "Aug 1, 2007"}
