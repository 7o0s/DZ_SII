Currently 17 years-old and counting, Rampart is likely the most straightforward tactical game of all time and probably always will be. Playing it is only a matter of building a stronghold on an island shoreline, placing cannons in calculated positions, and firing on a throng of enemy ships at the start of a round. Once that round is over, players must fill in fortress gaps created by hostile cannon balls and repeat so that eventually somebody wins.   With the proper equipment (that is, a trackball and a time machine), Rampart's simple setup is borderline fun. Back in the day, the race against the clock to properly place new walls before the start of a new round was novel and dramatic, but on the PlayStation 3 it doesn't hold up at all. The culprit is the absolutely terrible control.   Don't rebuild -- steal a ship and escape while you can instead. As any series veteran can tell you, the key to success in Rampart is giving players the ability to place their citadel blocks quickly and accurately -- but without the original trackball attachment and zero adjustments made to account for the PS3's Sixaxis controller, doing what you want is nigh impossible. Why? Because the default speed of the cursor is way too fast (even more so if you use R1 to speed it up) and there's no option to slow it down for more precise placement. Because of this sloppiness, missing your intended move is commonplace and, with only a few seconds to rebuild a fort before the time runs out, it'll cost you the game over and over again.   There is nothing more frustrating in videogames than controls that won't do what you want them to.   To Rampart's credit, it does offer support for three people at a time in both offline and online arenas, but if you disliked the gamepad's response in single-player games, you're going to dislike it here as well -- it's just as bad. It doesn't help that the game's aural presentation is loaded with curiosities either. Things like buggy sound anomalies (menu screens shatter eardrums on audio settings that are normal for most other games, while the gameplay effects are whisper quiet with the same configuration) get annoying fast.With its shoddy Sixaxis support, Sony Online's version of Rampart doesn't do much for the game's memory. Even with online versus play, Leaderboards, and support for resolutions all the way up to 1080p, the overall lack of control seals this classic's fate.", "date": "May 21, 2007"}
