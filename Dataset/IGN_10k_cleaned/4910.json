What a surprise, though, that one of its first PlayStation games is another car combat game.  Rogue Trip could be considered Twisted Metal Again. But instead of just plopping you in the middle of an arena, there's now a point to the mayhem. The idea is simple: you drive tourists around various vacation spots, and earn money as they see the sights. Problem is, there's a load of other mercenaries that want the tourist, too, and will spare no expense in getting him (or her). Which means you'll need to have a heavily armored, heavily-equipped vehicle to defend yourself and your fare.  Each of the different characters in the game has his own car and special weapons, but standard weapons can be obtained by picking up icons along the battlefield. The game starts with the tourist stuck in the middle of the fight, and you'll need to pick him up before one of the others does. He'll stay with you until A) he panics, or B) someone hits you with an ejector button. When he leaves your vehicle, he's ripe for the picking, so you better work quickly in getting him back. Otherwise you won't be able to earn cash for repairs or weapon upgrades. The round ends when you've taken out all your opponents, but you won't earn money unless you take the tourist to all the photo opportunity points in the level.  To please fans of the Twisted Metal series, there's also an option where you don't need to worry about the tourist. It's simply a kill or be killed round that can be played single player, split-screen two player, or split-screen four players between two PlayStations via the link cable. I won't kid you  I never liked the Twisted Metal series. It was too hectic, too maniacal, and there wasn't enough to do except drive around and shoot the other cars. But  while Rogue Trip feels a heck of a lot like Twisted Metal, the inclusion of a ~tourist~ is a welcome element that adds more than you'd think to the gameplay. Now, you have to find a way to keep the guy in your car and locate all the photo opportunities. And if he somehow leaves your car, you have to go hunt him down. There's a lot more to do than just driving and shooting.The graphics certainly don't measure up to what we've seen of Twisted Metal 3 (developed by a different developer this time around), but the 3D engine in the game does its job, albeit unspectacularly. And the Bosstones soundtrack, while fine the first time you sit through it, really gets on your nerves, since missions can last five times longer than the CD track. So you'll play through the same tune at least five times. Thankfully there's some generic tunes in later missions, but I don't know how much more ska I can take.The two-player mode is enough to get the game, since you can play cooperatively and competitively. And what a blast if you can link up two systems.The new gameplay elements improve a somewhat dull (in my opinion) gaming genre. I still like Vigilante 8 better, but Rogue Trip's not a bad trip.", "date": "Oct 8, 1998"}
