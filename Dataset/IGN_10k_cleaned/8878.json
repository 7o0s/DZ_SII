Mario jumps, spins and stomps better than any other. Sonic runs at super speed. Kirby can fly, and even absorbs the abilities of others. All impressive skills, and all impressive heroes. Lolo does none of those things.The short, round, allover blue mascot of Adventures of Lolo can't fly or run fast. He can't steal his enemies' powers, and he can't even jump. Lolo's lackluster  except, however, for one trait that proves invaluable to him. Lolo has an extraordinarily high IQ.It's a useful gift when you're the star of a puzzle game, as Adventures of Lolo is a quest through a maze. Its series of sequentially presented single-screen brainteasers makes it unlike any other game currently available on the Virtual Console, and makes it a title that's certainly worth checking out  even if its hero is a bit untraditional.The story finds the peaceful kingdom of Eden Land invaded, by the neighboring, villainous Eggerland. King Egger, a.k.a. the Great Devil, kidnaps Princess Lala and imprisons her in his ten-level fortress  a labyrinthine structure composed of, overall, 50 different puzzle-based rooms. Lolo, brave and bold even without the traditional build of a hero, heads swiftly inside to conquer the puzzles one by one.Each room is laid out differently, but all have one element in common  Heart Framers. Little heart-shaped icons in white boxes, Lolo's task is to collect each and every one, in order to make the room's treasure chest open, or to activate the appearance of a staircase that will take him higher in the castle. Some of the Heart Framers are easy to collect, as they're out in the open and can simply be walked to and claimed. Most, though, take a bit of ingenuity to reach.You'll have to push blocks to clear a path. Or build a bridge to cross a waterway. Or activate Lolo's limited egg-shooting ability to encase an enemy in a circular shell and either eliminate it altogether, or shove it around the level  and those are the real key. The enemies. Because dealing with each different type is usually the basis for each room.There are Snakeys, who just get it the way but won't hurt you. There are Skulls, who are similarly dormant, but who come to life and chase you after you collect the last Heart Framer. There are Rockys who push you around, Almas who roll after you like bowling balls with brains, Leepers who fall asleep upon your touch. There are lots of enemies.The most challenging to deal with, though, are the ones who attack with projectiles  like the Medusas. If you ever cross into the line of sight of a Medusa, Lolo's immediately frozen in place and then run through with an instant-kill dagger. Harsh. So getting through any room containing them is a careful dance of movement and block placement, as you rearrange emerald boxes and egg-encased enemies to block off the Medusa's deadly gaze, then sneak by to grab the hidden Hearts.There's an addictive, engaging, ~just one more room~ quality to the Adventures of Lolo that will really keep you intrigued as you play  it's the kind of game that you can finish a session of, look at the clock beside you, and be amazed that it's so much later in the day than you thought it was. It's especially satisfying when you think you've got a room all figured out, and then, as your triumphantly stroll to the treasure chest to move on to the next challenge, an angle of attack you forgot to consider allows a Medusa to zap you and defeat all your progress. It really is a head-scratcher on several occasions, and that's high praise for any puzzler.Puzzle action and maze game fans will be intrigued by Adventures of Lolo. This particular style of hero-based, maze-clearing game is one that's really been lost over the years  the closest comparison you'll find on the VC would be Solomon's Key, or Milon's Secret Castle, but Lolo is far superior to both of those games. This title went on to great success on the NES, two decades ago, and ultimately had two 8-bit sequels, both of which will likely also come to the Console in the future. And all three get our recommendation right up front. Here in this new age of Nintendo, where the company is focused more on mass appeal, expanded audience games like Brain Age and Big Brain Academy, a thoughtful, funny, engaging maze adventure is a perfect fit. It would be a great time, now, for Lolo's Adventures to continue, perhaps on the Nintendo DS, so let the Big N know by investing 500 Wii Points here.", "date": "Aug 11, 2007"}
