The kind of licenses that will make gamers finally cast off the disparaging press that Nokia once rightly earned with the botched original N-Gage launch, and embrace what the Finnish company's determination to make the QD the gaming rig they imagined in the first place. A major deal, like a Halo could do that. We're not exactly convinced that SSX has the selling power to bring the masses, but the best snowboarding franchise on the market certainly carries some weight -- and this N-Gage edition of the third edition of the series stands to bring a few more gamers into the N-Gage fold while pleasing loyalists.   As mentioned SSX: Out of Bounds is a port of the third game in Electronic Arts' bestselling snowboard series -- arguably the most polished edition of the trio. It's a wise jumping off point, as gamers would whole-heartedly reject playing a port of a four-year-old game at this point.   What might surprise skeptics most about SSX: Out of Bounds is just how much is crammed into the game. Very little of the console game got the hatchet on the way to N-gage. The three peaks, there are eleven tracks, all ten of the stars (Elise, Psymon, etc.) -- they've all in this game. Sure, some of the track layouts have been tweaked -- but that's to make the game run more efficiently on both the N-Gage's guts as well as the portrait-style screen. (However, even some course tweaking is not enough to overcome some problems that do affect game play, as is discussed later in this review.)   Even the soundtrack, which you would imagine would be near-impossible to squeeze on an MMC chip, is front and center. Sure, the sound quality isn't exactly tops (it's not so bad you can't make out lyrics or anything, but there is some very obvious compression), but it's hard not to be impressed that you get full tracks from artists like Red Hot Chili Peppers, Thrice, and the Chemical Brothers. SSX: Out of Bounds even includes an exclusive bonus track: ~Too Hot~ by the Swollen Members. (Ho ho.)   There are a number of ways to play SSX: Out of Bounds, from the Conquer the Mountain single-player mode where you chart the career of a rider, earning both respect and costume/board upgrades. There is Bluetooth multiplayer for up to four boarders. Shadow Racing allows you to record you top runs and race against ghost images to improve your performance. SSX also supports N-Gage Arena, which allows you to upload ghost files and download other best times to see how you stack up against the global competition. Nokia also has some exclusive Arena content in the works, such as new outfits and boards.   SSX: Out of Bounds has three peaks, one for each skill level. If you are new to the N-Gage, it's likely best to take the easy course at first, even if you are a pro at the console version. It takes a few runs to get used to the N-Gage control. You can map the face buttons to your liking, making it easy to pull off some of the harder tricks by a simple button press. In a nice addition, you now hear an audio flourish when you successfully pull of a trick. This is nice for those moments that the camera has pulled out fairly far and it's hard to see what position your wildly contorting boarder is currently in.   All of the tricks from the console version have made it into SSX: Out of Bounds, including the eight Super-Uber tricks for each rider. In order to pull off these tricks, you must fill your trick meter by pulling off midair stunts. Of course, you can always draw from your trick meter to boost down the slope, should you need to put a little distance between yourself and the rest of the pack. Which is often a good thing, because SSX: Out of Bounds includes the punching feature.   Now, as pleased as we are that so much content was stuffed into SSX: Out of Bounds, sometimes bursting at the seams can hurt a game. And that is occasionally the case with this one. The N-Gage has some trouble when the screen gets too crowded with geometry, which is especially evident in the Metro level. The skyscrapers may have been trimmed back a little to help out, but when you have buildings, rails, and riders on screen, the game starts to stutter. And unlike a shooter, SSX: Out of Bounds is not a game that benefits from the occasional slowdown.   Also of note is a problem that has plagued previous N-Gage racing games -- it is often difficult to see an upcoming turn. In the case of SSX, it's because a blocky polygon suddenly juts in the way or the alignment of the screen keeps a curve just out of sight until it's almost too late.   One more thing that bears mentioning is that EA has definitely tried to position SSX as more than just a snowboard racer/trick game. They have really attempted to infuse some personality into the game, such as giving the riders distinct phrasing and voices, as well as some facial animation. Even though all of the riders are accounted for in the N-Gage edition, due to the small screen and the lack of the voice work, much of the personality has faded. That's not a deal breaker, but for fans of the series, it will be noticably absent while playing.   However, as it stands, SSX: Out of Bounds is easily one of the best-looking N-Gage games available right now. The tracks and frame rate may get a little wonky, but you have to appreciate the craftsmanship that went into squeezing the SSX look into such a small compartment. True, SSX: Out of Bounds does suffer from some of the N-Gage's pitfalls, such as ugly textures when viewed close up, but when you are on a smooth slope and the frame rate is solid, SSX: Out of Bounds is a slick little game.SSX: Out of Bounds is a game I wish had been out a long time ago -- it's the sort of game that may have hushed detractors in a way that a 2-D Sonic never could. For $30, you get a remarkable facsimile of the console game, absolutely bursting with content. But just like it's hard for a writer to lose a favorite passage, the developer should have shown a little less mercy. The Metro track should have been cut, for example, because it sets a bad tone. Some of the songs probably could have been excised to make room for better quality of the remaining tracks. But make no mistake, this is a very playable game -- and a very playable version of SSX -- that shames the sorry Game Boy Advance edition released some time ago. If you want a go-go snowboarding game, there really is no better option than SSX: Out of Bounds.", "date": "Jan 23, 2005"}
