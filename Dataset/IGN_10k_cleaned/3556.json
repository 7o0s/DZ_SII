Actually, I would assume that it doesn't float a lot of people's boats. But like other niche sports, horse racing does have a loyal and enthusiastic audience that couldn't be more excited about a game series such as Gallop Racer, and it's playing a game like Gallop Racer 2003: A New Breed that makes one realize how much depth and detail is involved in horse horsing.  If you're one of those folks who does follow the horse circuit and are looking for a game to help you experience it firsthand, there's no better solution on the PS2 than Gallop Racer 2003: A New Breed. Even those not desperately hot-blooded for some Equus callabus racing competition, but are more intrigued by the breeding side of things will find something to like here. For everyone else, well, how much do you like horses?   Gameplay Gallop Racer 2003: A New Breed is a relatively halcyon game that will not require you to mash buttons, kill aliens, or save the world from terrorists. What is required is patience, and perhaps a love of horses and micromanagement. As the name implies, Gallop Racer 2003 focuses around, you guessed it, racing horses. But the term ~racing~ might imply something it shouldn't. This game is not about high speed races, nor is the pace in any way similar to a more traditional racing game.  Though this is a racing game, consider it more of a racing simulation. Rather than pushing a button to accelerate, more (well, actually all) emphasis is put on getting off to a good start, maintaining horse position and stamina, and how well the last stretch is played out. To be honest, half of the race is automated -- the horse will run forward and turn corners with no assistance from the player at all -- with user interaction involving minor adjustments to the areas previously mentioned. While some players may expect or want a larger part of the actual racing, it would defeat the purpose of the game. Being a good jockey requires that you play to the horses strengths and preferences, which is exactly what you'll be doing in Gallop Racer 2003.     The races are easily the most exciting moments in Gallop Racer 2003, but they will only take up half of your gameplay time. The other half will be spent buying, managing, and breeding your personal horse collection. With literally three thousand(!) horses in the game, completists may have to look elsewhere if they hope to maintain a social life. What's even more amazing than the wide selection of horses is the fact that each and every horse has a unique name that could double as a seventies rock band or a codename in Metal Gear Solid. Frugal Lark? Perfect Minister? Captain Fame? You know you love it.      Know nothing about horse racing? That's ok because Gallop Racer 2003 forces gamers to complete a tutorial that covers the basics of racing your horse. Unfortunately, it cannot be bypassed, even after you've learned to play the game. Still, the presence of any tutorial is better than none. Also, a few more tutorials on the finer aspects of horse statistics and racing would have been helpful. Of course, I'm sure someone more skilled in the way of horses will have a much easier time settling into the game, but a little extra guidance couldn't hurt.   My biggest complaint about Gallop Racer 2003 is the menu navigation. With so man stats to worry about, you can be sure that there are more than a few menus to work through. The problem is that the hierarchy of screens seems to be slightly disorganized making for an almost trial-and-error experience when looking for a particular screen. Still, this is a minor peeve in an otherwise fine horse racing simulation.  Graphics Gallop Racer 2003: A New Breed is certainly a better looking game than its predecessor, but what exactly that amounts to is purely up to the player. This is a horse racing simulation, after all. Though the horse models look only a hair better (they were always good to begin with), everything else from the riders to the tracks themselves have had a significant upgrade in visual quality; smoother lines, finer textures, and much less of an aliasing problem make Gallop Racer 2003 stand a good head taller than the previous game.  Another area where Gallop Racer has improved the visual quality is in the interface design, though some would argue differently. Gallop Racer 2001's interface was neutral in color, sleek and stylish in design, and there was a sexy CG girl guiding you through the necessary steps. The game, right down to the loading screens, had a twenty first century aesthetic. Rather than improve on this style, Gallop Racer 2003 has taken a completely different path and made the game more, for lack of a better word, kiddy. Menus are rounder, bolder, and infinitely more colorful. And the girl? Gone. In her place? A super-deformed horse that's only slighter cuter than IGN Codes' Chris Carle. The new ~look~ goes a long way in making Gallop Racer 2003's interface much easier to navigate and analyze.   Sound Just as a reminder, this is game is based around horse racing. Now that we've got that out of the way, know that sound and music play a somewhat minimal role in Gallop Racer 2003. That's not to say the game is silent (it isn't), but don't expect moving scores or explosive sounds. Instead, prepare yourself for light, almost elevator music-like tunes that could double as the theme song for early 80s show, Hart to Hart.  What else is there? Horses gallop, nicker and neigh, and the crowd cheers. That about covers it. In terms of quality, it's about as good as it should be. What more could you ask for.   David Cronenberg's Spider was a slow, almost inaccessible movie. My first impression was, ~What is this movie about? Get to the point.~ But over the its two-hour runtime, the movie grew on me as it began to show its complexity and layering in an all too subtle way. I left the theatre feeling satisfied in a way that's hard to put on paper, but easily felt. But Spider isn't for everyone. In fact, it may not be for the majority of the populace, but those seeking out its unique idiosyncrasies would be hard-pressed to find a better way to spend their leisure time. Gallop Racer 2003: A New Breed also falls in this ~good if you like that sort of thing~ category. It's got plenty of depth and, believe it or not, there is skill involved. Considering the lack of horse racing games on the PS2, this is truly as good as it gets.", "date": "Apr 1, 2003"}
