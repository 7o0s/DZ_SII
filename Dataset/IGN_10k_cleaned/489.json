You can't swing your Grandma's cat around a K-Mart without hitting at least five for the PlayStation alone. I've given in to the fact that it's a popular game formula, but a game would have to be really good to make me sit up and take notice. Disruptor, say, what's this? (Cue sound of PSXPower editor sitting up.)   Disruptor exists within the confines of the first-person shooter, this is true, but it makes the most of its existence. To begin with, the control is superb, yet simple. Opting for a 'less is more' approach, Insomniac have kept the actions to a minimum, confining them to shoot, jump, open, and strafe, which lets you concentrate on the task at hand. Disruptor runs at 30fps, so movement is fast and smooth. Getting around tight corners is a breeze, and there's none of that 'stickiness' you get in some Doom-clones.   Universal were determined to keep Disruptor fresh throughout the course of its 13 levels, so each stage is totally unique in look and feel. Levels range in style from the standard corridors and tunnels to snow and open terrain. There's even a surreal dream level that takes place inside your head! The levels grow more challenging as you go, with enemy AI and firepower increasing accordingly. To say it was challenging would be an understatement.   No first-person shooter would be complete without great guns, and Disruptor's got them. The arsenal includes standard bullet-based pistols, and plenty of alien weapons. In addition, psychic warfare plays a large part in your attack strategy, so each level gives you a new 'psionic,' or psychic power, such as electrical shock or heal, which can be used in conjunction with your regular weapon. It's an interesting feature that adds a whole new level to the gameplay.   Disruptor probably won't win any Doom-haters over, but for gamers who like a good shooter, you can't do much better than this.", "date": "Jan 14, 1997"}
