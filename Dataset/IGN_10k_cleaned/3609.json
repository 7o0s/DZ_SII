Midway's seminal classic shooter, Defender, gets super-shrunk for some go-go space blasting, but does this version manage to recreate the manic fun of the original?FEATURES: High score tableDefender is considered one of the best side-scrolling shooters, as well as one of the best arcade games ever made.  That's a tall order for this wireless edition of the game to fill, and it's sad to report that it comes up way short.  In fact, you might even question if anybody even tried, as the game looks bland, has zero sound, and doesn't even come close to playing as fast and furious as the original. The essence of the game play is there, though.  You pilot the good ship Defender and zip across the landscape, blasting aliens before they can nab decidedly unintelligent humans on the ground.  If they manage to take their quarry to the top of the screen, a severe mutation takes place, and you then have to deal with a new, aggressive foe.  Just the plight of saving the humans was enough to get your heart racing in the arcade--you felt like a total schmuck if you lost a single one. None of this emotional attachment happens in cellphone Defender.  Probably because it only resembles Defender in passing.  The horizon is even blander than the original game, the ship is a single-tone pointy block, the aliens are made of just a few pixels, and the humans are itty-bitty sticks.  Yeah, this is a cellphone game, so of course it can't look that superduper--but c'mon.  These new phones can actually handle some serious color and decent sized sprites. You might think the visuals were sacrificed for speed.  You might be incorrect, as Defender really doesn't get a move on like it should.  You used to be able to zip over the landscape, madly blasting aliens.  Now, your spacefighter feels like it's on a Sunday drive.  Disappointing. Control is difficult.  Getting a bead on the aliens is tough stuff, because everything feels so inaccurate.  We had two aliens lined up right next to each other, fired a shot, and destroyed neither.  And before we could turn around, we ran straight into them.  I suppose that's what the smart bomb (assigned to ~4~) is for, to destory aliens that your guns obviously cannot.  Hyperspace (assigned to ~7~) still works, but we all know the risks of randomly warping to another area of the board.  Chances are, there's a bad guy waiting just a few pixel spaces away. Space is supposed to be silent, but this isn't a screening of ~2001.~  Arcade Defender was a fun, noisy game -- and the cellphone version has absolutely nothing.  Unexplainable, as there are several cellphone games out there that support musical themes and plenty of tones. I thought I'd try a three-shot of space-themed games this month, in hopes one would be a decent investment for cellphone gamers.  Boy, did I crap out.  Defender, like Stitch and Galaxian Mini, is just a boring, frustrating affair that is hardly worth the few bucks you pay for the download.  Bad visuals, bad control, bad sound.  Bad game makers, bad.", "date": "Apr 21, 2003"}
