But thanks to the GBA's upgraded hardware capabilities ,we're given a cool first attempt at an isometric platformer on the handheld  in Spyro the Dragon: Season of Ice. The game is definitely a good one, but it's not without flaws...and with a few additions and a bit of tweaks it could have gone from good to great. But being good ain't that bad, you know? Features More than 20 levels Unlockable minigames Battery Save (one save slot) Only for Game Boy Advance  Seems all the fairies in the land have been encased in ice, and it up to our pal purple dragon Spyro to save the day (again) by freeing them out of their frigid prison. The Game Boy Advance version of Spyro's adventure attempts to mirror the structured gameplay of the PlayStation trilogy -- Season of Ice is more of an exploration/collection game than a platformer. Oh, sure, you'll bound from ledge to ledge in certain places, but it's more about galloping around the area and locating gems and items, and the occasional crystalized fairy. These fairies aren't always out in the open, as in many instances in all of the game's levels, you have to perform tasks to get some characters to cough up a fairy of their own; in one level, for example, you'll have to ignite four lighthouses that are located in different areas of the beach level, or in another, headbutt a superfast thief in the merchant world. The tasks aren't incredibly tough to perform or figure out, it's just that you have to make sure that you've gone to every inch of the level to find everything that's necessary in completing them.  To give the game a better feeling of 3D, Digital Eclipse designed an isometric scrolling engine so that Spyro can move freely in every direction. The look is something similar to what Vicarious Visions did in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 on the GBA, and the same awkwardness that's in the skater is here in Spyro's adventure...players will have to adjust their eyes to understand the differing heights of all the surrounding ledges, because, other than Spyro's shadow, there isn't a good reference point to show which platforms are up high, and which ledges are separated by empty void. A lot of practice is necessary in order to learn the game's perspective, since players will have to use their jumping and gliding powers a lot in later levels.  The game doesn't use a 3D engine, so Spyro can't really ~look ahead~ in all directions like he can in the PlayStation designs to see gems, items, and areas a good distance away.  The developers try to alleviate this downside with a simple command: hold down L and you can scroll the screen a short distance in each direction. But this isn't enough, unfortunately...and I never found a reason to use this function. Instead, what the developers could and should have done was to offer a full map of each level that could be pulled up at any time, showing where your dragon is in relation to the rest of the level. A lot of time is spent backtracking over certain parts of a world trying to find that one place you haven't traversed yet, and it's a little unfair to the gamer to ~hide~ level areas from view because the screen doesn't scroll far enough to see. This could have been addressed by implementing a ~fog of war~ type element on the non-existent level map, only revealing areas that have actually been explored.  But despite this overall design fault, the game itself is very well put together -- Digital Eclipse worked like the dickens creating different things to do in the same isometric engine, and there's plenty here to keep players going to the end. And it's good that the developers saw that there's only so much you can do in this perspective, as there are minigames to unlock that add a bit more to the variety. The overhead Sparx levels isn't much more than a version of Gauntlet, but it's a lot of fun and a good surprise for those not knowing about these challenges. And though the Spyro flying levels are a nice addition, the designers didn't pounce on the opportunity to push the GBA's abilities...instead of an ambitious flight game like Pilotwings, we get a really, really basic version of Space Harrier. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed in seeing and playing this minigame...it's okay, just nothing special.    I really do like Spyro the Dragon. I think it's one of the better action games on the handheld...and with its cartridge battery saving everything in progress, it makes for a portable-friendly game as well. But the more I play the game, the more I see stuff that could have been improved on, and I'm hopeful that if and when it's time to create Spyro's portable sequel, the development team can fix and alter the game's obvious omissions and slight design compromises. As is, though, it's a good game with a lengthy quest and a decent challenge.", "date": "Nov 17, 2001"}
