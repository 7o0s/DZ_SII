No question. That image certainly tarnished the hot killer of the undead, at least in videogame form, but it's a curse she's apparently carrying more than three years later. Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Wrath of the Darkhul King is an original GBA design handled by a much more competent developer than her Game Boy Color outing, but the game is entirely dull and repetitive that captures almost none of the magic of the show. Even if you're a fan of the now-ended WB/UPN television series, you're only going to like it for the digitized stills of the cast. Features Sixteen levels Customizable weapons Cartridge save Only for Game Boy Advance  Japanese developer Natsume's worked with THQ several times in the past on Game Boy development, most notably the never-ending Power Rangers handheld series. The development studio was put to task on recreating the look and feel of the television show in a playable Game Boy Advance production, but the end result is a mishmash of design ideas that never gel into a fun game. There are a few solid elements of gameplay in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but in the end it's an incredibly repetitive design that's very unrewarding in its short time through the adventure.  The game's plot is based around the arrival of an evil beast known as the Darkhul King. Hundreds of years ago he was banished as a prisoner of a hidden dimension, but he's escaped; and he's putting his dead-raising powers to use all over Sunnydale. While the rest of her friends hide back in the coziness of their homes trying to figure out who this Darkhul King is and how to rid Sunnydale of him, Buffy has to head out into the streets and other locations to kick some undead booty in a side-scrolling action design. Buffy's the only playable character in this adventure; the other television players are represented through still screens digitized from the series...which admittedly are the only graphics that look good in this lacking action title.  While the developers try to make it look like Buffy has a whole lot of ass-kicking skills and technique, all that's really required is a rapid thumb on the A and B buttons to knock out the enemies, followed by a stab in the chest with a wooden stake that's collected all over the environments. Sure, players can collect weapons and combine them to create even more powerful weapons, but the action is bland since the designers never implemented any encouragement to use anything beyond the fist-foot-stake combination. Sure, you'll find places to use the crossbow or axe, but it's actually a chore to bring them out of your inventory and into combat that it's almost not worth the effort. Occasionally players will be able to do more than just kick and punch; locate door switches, for example, or shove crates to access higher levels. But these are extremely rudimentary gameplay elements that have been done better a zillion times before in other games.  The game just doesn't feel like it was handled by a competent Game Boy Advance design team; the collision detection in the combat engine is a bit wonky since some punches connect but others don't...and it's not exactly fun to miss stabbing someone in the chest by only a pixel or two when they're down on the ground. The in-game graphic style, full of awkward angles and poorly-drawn sprites, does nothing to ~wow~ gamers with special effects, and the scrolling perspective is actually hard to follow since due to the designers creating platforms that move deeper into the background for no real reason.", "date": "Aug 5, 2003"}
