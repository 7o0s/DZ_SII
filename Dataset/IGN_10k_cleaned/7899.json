Can you remember where you were when you first saw Super Mario 64 in action? Many of you can. Because for many of you, it was a magical moment  you'd grown up with the plumber's 2D sidescrollers, were accustomed to the simple graphics of the NES. You were taken aback at the leap he'd made into 16-bit, and the colorful upgrade the Super NES offered. But even that didn't prepare you  you were still shocked and amazed like never before at seeing true 3D worlds for the first time. Getting that first glance at Super Mario 64 was a defining moment for many loyal Nintendo fans, now over 10 full years ago. But even after a decade, Mario's 3D debut still inspires that same sense of wonder.   Super Mario 64 was the flagship launch title for the Nintendo 64, arriving on store shelves back in September of 1996. It was one of the most highly anticipated video games ever, fueled by the hype that its full 3D gameplay was supposed to be the most immersive play experience ever made, and refueled by the fact that it was. Super Mario 64 was a revolution  games had been presented with 3D graphics before, but never with the open-ended, go-anywhere, free-roaming worlds found within the freshly constructed Peach's Castle.   It's inside the Princess's Palace that our plucky plumber is put through his paces by several peculiar paintings. Mario must enter a variety of explorable environments by jumping through the canvases of these hanging portraits, each one a portal to a different set of star-catching challenges. Power Stars are the measure of progress in Super Mario 64  there are 120 in all, and gathering increasing quotas of them opens up more levels, and eventually boss encounters with Bowser himself.   The fun of the game lies in how Mario handles. There's a sense of simple joy to running around these worlds, making Mario jump, kick, climb trees and even fly. The Nintendo 64's controller was designed specifically for this game, to be the perfect interface for controlling Mario's vastly expanded repertoire of moves. It innovated beyond the established SNES pad by adding an analog stick, a Z trigger, and a set of four camera-control buttons. Now on the Virtual Console, things look a little different  Super Mario 64 can be played either with a Classic Controller or a GameCube pad.   The Classic Controller handles well, mapping the C-Button camera functions to the second analog stick on the right, and feeling natural enough that the game's fun factor isn't harmed in the transition. A better fit, though, is a normal GameCube Controller, or a Wavebird. Almost every current Nintendo fan got a chance to play 2002's GameCube release, Super Mario Sunshine, and the comfort level of controlling our main mustachioed man with a Cube pad still feels natural from that adventure.   And Super Mario 64 has never looked this good before. Heralding a bright future full of graphically enhanced N64 titles, the Virtual Console version of Super Mario 64 features visuals vastly improved over its original cartridge release. This Mario runs in 480p, and is vibrant, crisp and totally smooth. The muddiness that plagued the N64 for years is gone now  it's almost worth downloading the game just to see how much better it looks now than 10 years ago.   Editor's Note: Super Mario 64 was first reviewed by IGN on September 25, 1996. The verdicts established by past reviews still stand, as they are critiques of the products during the years that they were originally released. Our Virtual Console reviews are, in contrast, designed to provide readers with assessments of the re-released games in today's marketplace, answering whether the classic play styles are still fun and, ultimately, if the offerings are worth your hard-earned Wii Points. You can read the full archived review of Super Mario 64 by clicking here.  Super Mario 64 is the one and only Nintendo 64 game available on the Virtual Console so far  but it makes a statement all by itself.  The game is a true classic. A masterpiece of design that revolutionized the industry and set the standard by which all 3D games would be judged. It's still a blast to play today, handles well with the transition to different controller styles, and looks better than ever through the power of running on the Wii. It's well worth its asking price in Wii Points, and should be a part of every Wii owner's lineup of Virtual Console titles. Mario amazed the world 10 years ago, and marked a moment in the lives of many faithful Nintendo fans. Now those fans can experience the sense of wonder all over again, and a new generation can appreciate this adventure for the very first time.Another Takefrom Matt CasamassinaNintendo 64's early flagship title demonstrates the power of the hardware as well as the creative genius of Miyamoto and team. Not only does the game obliterate every platformer before it in terms of visual finesse, it plays just as well if not infinitely better than previous 2D incarnations of the Mario franchise. 3D worlds are huge and cleverly laid-out so that there's never a dull moment. Secrets play a huge part of the experience, recapturing the classic gameplay style of the series. In fact, this game is exactly as one might hope it would be: Mario in 3D. More freedom, more space, more options, better graphics, improved and elaborated control schemes  it's all there. Possibly the greatest video game achievement ever.", "date": "Jan 10, 2007"}
