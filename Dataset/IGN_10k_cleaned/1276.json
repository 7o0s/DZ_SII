In fact it was with that title that they re-established the NHL franchise as a serious contender, going up against PowerPlay '98, BreakAway '98 and FaceOff '98 all in the same year.  Those were tough times for EA, as its previous Madden no-show and lackluster NHL '97 had EA loyalists in quite a panic.   Then, as the 1998 and 1999 versions emerged, EA Sports dominated the ice once more. Truth is, they had no choice.  With the Sega Genesis versions still holding their own with 16-bit gamers, it was simply a matter of time before EA was forced to make the transition into 32-bit gaming with its heritage intact.  The end results were hockey games of epic proportions--games that took the presentation (an EA hallmark) to even higher production levels of value.  Once again, EA has scored a hit--this time with NHL 2001.  Does the ~Puck~ stop here?  Let's take a look!  Presentation Without taking away any of the [literal] thunder from other aspects of this review, I will say that every facet of this game lends to its presentation that's in many ways without equal.  From the opening introduction, to the music, announcers, menu screens, interface and just about any other thing you can imagine, EA Sports has rounded this title out with a level of production that is simply splendid.  With all the years it has been producing the EA NHL franchise anything less than this type of effort would be unacceptable.  Foregoing the usual full-motion video clips, EA chose to use a rendered introduction and it is quite effective stuff indeed.  The cuts are snappy, the animations are crisp and the whole package does a nice job of heightening the excitement of playing the game...well, at least for the first few times, anyway.  The game offers up all 30 National Hockey League teams, including the expansion teams the Minnesota Wild and the Columbus Blue Jackets.  There are also 20 International teams.  This time around EA has added Latvia and the Ukraine, just incase someone was missing their presence.  How's that for added value?  Gameplay The number one aspect, in my humble opinion, that plays the most critical role in making or breaking a videogame based on hockey is proper pacing. This pacing must be truly relative to the on-screen action and the timings of the periods as played in the videogame.  Sounds like a simple thing to address, but I assure you it is not.  EA has done a great job of making this game seem properly paced as the more mature difficulty settings.   If you play the game on the Beginner setting, you will (of course) find that there are many more goals to be had-which would make one think that the pacing of this game is not as all accurate as I am indicating.  However, the game was never designed with Beginner play in mind, at least as a standard. Familiarize oneself with the game and pump the difficulty up to Pro, however, and things really seem to gel much mo' better.  Hockey should seem frantic and EA has gotten frantic down better than Harrison Ford in a sequel of his 1987 flop of the same name.  Again, as stated earlier, pace is the key.  It is what makes hockey so appealing to those who know little about the game and are experiencing it as a videogame for the first time.  The frenetic pace and the urge to score are the core elements of excitement.  If you make a hockey game, and playing it is not exciting, you have failed.  Simple as that.  In this case, EA has scored.  Whipping around the ice, courtesy of the splendid Dual Shock Analog Pad is a breeze.  And the speed is so hip, that you can almost hear a breeze whistling in your own ears as you navigate the puck bearer through the serpentine of defenders.  Control is intuitive navigable -- both of which are critical components when having to make snap decisions, on-the-fly at high speeds.  Having to fuss with sticky or non-responsive controls would spell disaster for a hockey game.  Just ask anyone who has ever played...never mind...I am going to be good this time around.  I made my point.  Nonetheless, the control scheme in this year's offering is well implemented and not over-complicated.  In fact, I would say the controls in NHL 2001 are not complicated at all.  Besides passing and shooting with relative ease of execution, players can Deke, Speed Burst, Spin, Check, Slide Block Poke Check and throw some Big Hits with all but a cursory knowledge of the default control layout.  Not bad at all, and certainly something that has emerged as the result of many years of trial, error and revision.  This scheme strikes affirm balance between playability and player ability.  Fighting, an integral element of any ice contest that is not figure skating, is included in a simple ~Beat yo' @ss~ formula.  A rather simplified set of buttons is all you need tug and slug your way to the penalty box and a news smile.  Fights happen sort of randomly, although there are some situations that will almost guarantee that a ~fight trigger~ will come your way.  How you ask?  Find out for yourself...I ain't spoilin' the fun.  EA alleges that there is new mo-cap in this game, and I will give them the benefit of the doubt.  I am not being snippy here at all.  I just can't seem to discern some of the newer moves, because I can't keep from getting completely wrapped up in playing the game, so as to allow me time for actually sitting back to watch for and identify the new animations.  Hence, I yield to their integrity on this one. [Actually, I just made all that up to illustrate to you how engrossing the game really is.  There are some new moves in there, and the integration with the old code is seamless.]  But it is terribly engrossing nevertheless.  And that ain't no fib!  Shot speeds vary based upon length of time the button is depressed, and the type of shot executed.  You have the Slapshot, Wrist Shot, One-footed Wristers, Cannon Shots, One-Timers and the ability to place the shot high, low, left or right without much thumb-numbing overkill.  In playing the game, it was easy to discern the difference between the various shots.  The reaction time of the goalies is also clearly discernable, from team-to-team, whenever there are moderate to large variances in the skill levels of the men charged with stopping the puck.  However, varying goalie styles makes developing strategy against these hot-handed hoofers a tactical task-not a haphazard exploitation. You will not find goalies freezing the puck just for the hell of it.  With all rules in effect (the only way to properly evaluate the AI) I found the game really did a nice job with player positioning, line management and offensive/defensive formation adjustments.  Teammates were rarely out of position on plays, and hustled well to reposition on rapid turnovers and misdirected plays.  This made getting of the one-timer and finding an open man to bail the puck to easier than in years past.  This proved a welcome change and one that made the game seem that much more like the real thing.  For those who thought Madden Challenge was neat-o-rific stuff, EA has answered the call and included a similar feature into NHL 2001 as well.  NHL Challenge is the stuff dreams are made of.  After a rather lengthy set-up, you can begin to have your User log track your achievements.  Doing so earns points within a three level tier structure that can later be used to boost attributes Created Players.  It is a game within a game, and one that is certainly worth the set-up time and effort to deploy.  Playing through a Season offers up the standard results.  You move onto Playoffs, Post Season Awards, and eventually the Stanley Cup Championship match.  You can also try the Tournament Mode in addition to breaking ties with the Shootout.  And if that were not enough, players can find tons of flexibility when using the game's extensive Career Mode.  NHL 2001 is a behemoth of an offering, with something for everyone. Graphics Graphically this game has slacked up a bit, but for a good reason.  The framerate has gotten a much needed boost, and is likely that CPU muscle was gleaned by de-emphasizing looks to compensate for rendering speed and smoothness.  Whatever the alchemy used to achieve the result, we can say for sure that while the game not as juicy in the eye-candy department as last year's game, it is certainly improved in the animation and control departments.  Polygon count has certainly been reduced, or perhaps it is texture quality. On PlayStation, especially at this late stage in its life cycle, it can sometimes be hard to tell.  But nothing you will notice about the graphics will change how much you will like the new life given to the players as they animate and you control them across the ice.  So NHL 2001 won't win any beauty contests.  At this point, now that many gamers have seen and played Dreamcast games, and have been gawking at PS2 previews, it is all moot at this point anyway.  So why not shift focus to the gameplay on PlayStation? Shouldn't it always be that way in the first place?  New animations, well modeled arenas, visible behavioral reactions and the ability to keep up with the puck in the thick of the game are all reasons to give NHL 2001 a nod for having the visual aspects in tact.  There is some occasional slowdown to be found and there is some dithering as well, but the game is sound and comes off looking very nice on PlayStation.  EA Canada has done a nice job with fine tuning this game for maximum playability and visual balance.  Sound Here is another area where EA has done great things and with NHL 2001 there is no change in status.  The game sounds great and lends to the overall production value and presentation of the sport.  Excellent crowd samples, terrific commentary and hard-hitting sound FX make NHL 2001 a tour de force for audiophiles.  Sure Jim Hughson and Bill Clement can get a bit behind the play at times, but that happens while trying to cover the real thing as well.  Hockey is fast folks!  SO give the guys a break.  Seriously though, the music, the menu sounds and the in-game audio package is quality stuff, through and through.I love a good hockey game and this one is quite a player.  The mark of anygood hockey game, for me, has been whether or not my palms sweat when I amplaying.  This one passes my very non-scientific test with flying colors.  Iwas a clam monster from the first period through the last.  This bodes quitewell for this game.I never tired of the commentary, my eyes stayed glued to the screen whileplaying, it was hard to put down and actually found myself having toremember to breath at times.  That is how intense the competition was andhow much I was immersed in the experience.  After playing, I could track mystats via a very deep statistical database, and that simply made the package[that much more] complete.EA has done it again, by coming up with yet another improved version ofclassic franchise, one that we know will do well on the new system comeOctober 26th.  Until then however, if you want a great playing game ofhockey, this one is a sure winner for almost anyone who enjoys playing thegame.", "date": "Sep 26, 2000"}
