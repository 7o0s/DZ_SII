Let us pay homage to the land of the free, home of the brave, and nation where any idiot with too much free time on his hands can dream up a new sport that's an instant hit. So clumsy you'd never cut it at freestyle walking? Too much of a wussy to join the street luge crowd?  Not enough of a drinker to finish a beer so you can play Beer Pen (aka Inkaholics)?  Today's your lucky day! Say ~hasta la vista~ to normality, kick the Ultimate Frisbee geeks in the nads, and set yourself up as a disc golfer...they get all the chicks. Innova Disc Golf is the freshest branded beast to be cranked out of WizardWorks' sweatshops.  And no, I'm not being harsh when I describe their software labs as such. Observe the product. Behind the cheery facade of some sunglass-wearing twerp throwing a Frisbee at a basket lurks a game whose budget would make proper development houses cringe. A bold claim, it's true, but what else can you infer when a piece of software created in this millennium that contains absolutely zero lines of code devoted to AI routines? Thank your lucky stars that LAN and TCP/IP play is included, else you'd have to round up three or four friends every time a tournament was called for.  However if you decide to tackle the game, whether in a single round of 9-18 holes or a pro season, you'll be going at it alone. Since the greens are going to be quiet, it won't matter which of the four courses you choose to play on. Creekside and Wooden Bridge are set against pleasant natural backdrops, while Gator Glade offers a palm-treed view of the landscape and Pine Mountain lifts you up into rugged terrain.  Courses differ in the placement of holes and obstacles, but suffer from an alarming lack of detail. Overall, the environments blend together into one big, indiscernible mush that doesn't mean squat in terms of short term memory.  Though it does wonders for many other products, the third dimension holds little in store for disc golf players. Adopting a similar style of presentation to Pete Jacobsen's Golden Tee Golf, you're provided with a grainy, cardboard cutout view of a portion of the green. It's possible to change the viewing angle, but doing so requires the game to load and initialize the new scenery, which is a frequent bite in the butt. An overhead map displays your current position, points being aimed for, and the location of the basket (substituted for the hole). Sadly, while Sundial Interactive filched Innova Disc Golf's look from Pete Jacobsen's baby, they didn't pilfer the interface convention that allowed you to plot throws directly on the map.  Joy. This means that you'll have to work the mouse to position a pole at random points to delineate distance and direction while using the overhead view as a compass. Selecting a suitable target is only the beginning though, because you'll also have to pick the proper disc type for each throw.  Eleven Frisbee variations, ranging from the agile Aviar to the powerful line-drive hitter known as the Cheetah, are at your fingertips. All Frisbee models have their uses, so you're entitled to the pleasure of becoming intimately familiar with the tools on hand. Finally, to launch the disc, a dual-click meter is used to set the throw angle and check for power and accuracy. Because throws have a way of going where least desired even when the wind isn't blowing, it's a real ball buster to get the hang of the interface. Hence the reason for a Mulligan, or the ~retry with no penalty because I suck~ button.  Alone, with no computer opponents to play with, it's inherent that the only competition is your score. Trying to perfect one's technique is a lofty, but downright boring goal. Multiplayer competitions allow you the comfort of human interaction and trash talking, though the chances of finding a buddy that owns the game, let alone wants to play it, are slim to none. Short of a Playboy endorsement of the sport, I can't see anything in the near future that will cause a surge in the number of viable competitors you're likely to encounter.  On the same note, short of a full frontal lobotomy, I can't see any reason that would make you want to purchase this title. Comatose gameplay, hand-me-down graphics and annoying player commentary delivered without a shred of emotion aren't signs of a keeper. The moral of the story is that if it's disc golf you want to play, stand on the roof of a nearby building, pull back on the CD, and let 'er rip. Watching someone get beaned is the only way you're going to recoup twenty dollar's worth of entertainment out of this binger. -- Scott Steinberg", "date": "Jun 20, 2000"}
