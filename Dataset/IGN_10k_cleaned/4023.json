Three years later the boom has long since popped, the PS2 is well established and that fantastic cinematic experience has finally landed on your gaming system. I wish I could say it was worth the wait. That would be assuming that anyone was actually waiting and the game was even remotely good.   It must have sounded great on paper. Take a beautiful kung fu movie with lyrical flair to spare and translate that experience to gamers. There were so many sets to work with: the restaurant, the bamboo forest, the desert, and many, many more. There were so many characters to work with as well: the guy with the half-shaved head, the feisty girl-thief, and that woman from that Bond movie, Tomorrow Never Dies.   Put those pieces together and you think, ~damn, if you just have some hot kung fu action with those people and those places and some tasty morsels to flesh out a meal, you got yourselves a GAME!~ Yeah, well, almost, but not quite. It sure looks like the movie but plays like a stale Double Dragon wannabe.   Gameplay  The game is broken up into three parts, one for each character of the movie. You play each character all the way through the game in order to get to the next character. The characters are, in order of play, Jen (the girl), Yu Shu Lien (the woman), and Li Mu Bai (the swordsman). The story lines mimic each characters role in the movie, leading up to a climactic battle between Li Mu Bai and Jade Fox, the evil old woman swordsman.    Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is filled with kung fu brawls. You might even say the whole game is one long brawl. So I will. This game is basically one long brawl. The general situation is this: you enter a new space and five guys run at you. As you dispatch them, they get replaced by more people running in until they run out and you can move on. Lather, rinse, repeat.   Initially, you have your trusty sword your bare hands to fight with. If you dispatch a baddie you can grab his weapon from the floor and run with it. One battle scene features a room filled with a variety of weapons to pick up and fight with.   You have two skills, Weapon and Unarmed. Finish off a bad guy using a weapon or without and you will get more Special Attacks in the skill you used. Use a sword all the time and you acquire a new sword attack trick. To pull off a Special Attack, you need to stun an enemy, grab him, and tap in a series of buttons. This makes your character do anything from impaling people to juggling them with kicks. The rest of the fighting, however, is pretty standard stuff with a few basic attack combos. The only new addition is the blocking.   Instead of just blocking attacks and taking a little damage, you can do a Blocking Combo which uses a series of dodges, jumps, and swerves to avoid being hit at all. If you have a weapon, you can use it to deflect any sword or axe attacks. The end result is watching a cool series of choreographed moves and there are plenty of variations. One has you jumping backwards, landing on your hands, and springing forward again as you evade a pole-axe.   To pull off a Blocking Combo, you need to tap the L1 button in time with the attacks when a blocking icon starts flashing. This happens when a bad guy is about to lay into you with an attack combo. Now, in theory you are supposed to tap the L1 button in time with the attacks in order to block successfully. In reality, you just need to tap at a quick and steady pace and everything's copasetic.    Once the novelty wears off the game turns into one long slugfest. Tons of simpletons run up to fight and the main difference in enemies is the weapon they hold. Only the main enemies, and there are only four, have a significantly different fighting style.   Occasionally there are a few new elements to mix up the gameplay, but they are few, far between, and often so poorly executed you wish the developers hadn't even bothered. The worst offense is a Tomb Raider style jumping session toward the end of the game, featuring big jumps from stalagmite to stalagmite.   Graphics  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is visually faithful to the movie, but very sloppy. All of the action scenes are recreated from the movie, even if not incredibly detailed. The rest of the fights and locations are all pretty basic: mostly streets, forests, and castles. Despite the simplicity, a lot of locations get recycled throughout the game. Each character has a couple distinctive areas, but for the most part, it's the same streets, the same forests, and the same castles for all three missions.   The camera is practically a character in itself that you will learn to swear at. Like a lazy roommate, it never does what you want it to do. In the middle of a fight, you can often lose sight of enemies as the camera needs to be guided by you to cover the action. A few scenes involve platform style jumping from ledge to ledge and it's easy to lose sight of where you're going, often leading to a quick trip down into a bottomless chasm. One scene is called ~Leap of Faith~ where the camera refuses to budge at all to show you where you want to jump to.   Tying all this together is a sloppy and quick interface. Small white text zips up the screen to display story information. To make up for the lack of time spent on visuals, big chunks of movie footage get slapped between scenes. Fight loads of dudes, watch a clip, fight, watch a clip, etc.   Sound  The voices sound like an actor spent ten minutes in the sound booth to hash out. Some silly sounding grunts and groans are the majority of the sound effects. The music is generally much better as they were able to use the soundtrack from the movie. Still, it feels like it was rushed out the door without much thought.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon tries to create a novel martial arts fighting system, but quickly buries it in repetitive gameplay. All the bad guys are the same, the same environments get used over and over, and the large majority of the game is about squaring off with five guys at a time. Combine this with some sloppy design and a useless camera and you get a six hour mind-numbing experience.If you really want to relive the movie, buy the DVD and watch it again. You'll save money and get a quality experience.", "date": "Oct 16, 2003"}
