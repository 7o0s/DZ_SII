Since the day when we first discovered how to power slide in Mario Kart, it would be fine if the large number of kart racing games were just as good as Mario Kart.  That's when reality slaps us back in the face to show us how many bad kart racing games there are.  Whether they lack the solid gameplay, appealing characters, or challenging AI, the greatest flaw mediocre racing games can have is a lack of fun.  This week, the Dreamcast received a new kart racing game to join the rather average Pen Pen Tri-Icelon and the above average Wacky Racers.  So, just how good is  Looney Tunes: Space Race for the Dreamcast?  Before we get to the question, let's talk about the game for a bit.  Developed by those programming prodigies responsible for the lovely Editors' Choice Award winning Test Drive Le Mans, Melbourne House, Looney Tunes: Space Race just wouldn't look right if the characters, tracks, and backgrounds in it didn't look like a cartoon.  Melbourne House flexed its cell shading skills, a visual technique seen in games like Jet Grind Radio and Wacky Racers.  The results?  Even Tex Avery would be amazed at the cartoon nature this 3D game displays.  The characters animate with such fluidity, the only way to make the animation better would be to hire a hundred artists and hand draw each frame.  And yes, all the characters have their well-know mannerisms and sayings (in the case of Wile E. Coyote, he lifts up signs).  Then there are the wonderful backgrounds; every environment is filled with zany props, energetic colors, and a lot of ~visual noise~.  It's easy to get distracted from the actual racing because you want to see all the little details and things going on in the background.  Finally, we've got a pretty solid frame rate (30 fps) only dropping a few frames when the action on screen gets chaotic.  Basically, Space Race is an eyeful of wondrous images that are stuffed within the borders of your TV.  So the game looks sweet, but you're wondering if it suffers from the ~looks great, plays awful~ syndrome.  I mean, it would be easy to rely on the excellent visuals and the Looney Tunes license to sell this game, correct?  Well, worry not... Space Race may not have a lot of depth, but it certain has good control, challenging AI, and a great number of extra options.  You can select from a number of characters from the Looney Tunes universe (and yes, lots of extra characters to unlock), jump on your modified rocket racer, and blast off against 5 other opponents, all vying for a lifetime supply of ACME products.  Of course, you can pick up hilarious power-ups including a remote anvil dropper, a laser gun, a portable ~bottomless hole~, and my personal favorite, a device that drops a pink elephant on opponents.  Along with power-ups you can also pick up green canisters. Collect five and you'll be able to engage a limited turbo boost.  Of course, it's wise to use this on straight portions of the track, and believe me, those will appear less often than you like.  The track designs are very good and contain some crazy turns, killer climbs, and stomach-wrenching dips.  As the game's name suggests, you're in space -- so getting off the track means you'll lose a lot of time and drop in position ranking.  Obviously, each character has different characteristics in top speed, acceleration, and handling and while they're subtle, you can tell the differences between characters after you've played the game a few times over.  I think what ultimately won me over on this game was the challenging AI.  The computer opponents can be down right cheap at times; often it will seem like they will deliberately tag-team you.  For example, at one point in a race, Yosemite Sam blasted me with a pair of rockets and my character was thrown into the air momentarily, Elmer Fudd passed me and placed a ~portable~ bottomless hole RIGHT in my path, before I had control of my vehicle.  Sounds pretty unfair?  Well, as I found out, it goes both ways as I learned that the spring-loaded boxing glove is one of the most deadliest power-ups, as it can knock an opponent off the track with one well-timed hit.  You'll learn that there is a proper time and place for using all the power-ups, and sometimes it's better to hold on to a power-up instead of using it immediately.  And with this challenging AI, you'll quickly learn to remember the best places to use power-ups and turbo boosts.  Unlike other kart racing games where your success is based on how well you know the track and how perfectly you can time a power slide, Space Race is more tactical in its gameplay, where a properly aimed blast from the laser gun can mean the difference between first and fourth place.  The number of play options this game has is quite astounding.  Up to four human players can participate in a race and while the visuals suffer from some loss in detail, the framerate remains relatively solid.  Time Trial and Challenge mode not only give you racing practice, but also allow you to gain ACME tokens.  You can use these tokens to participate in Special Events that unlock new tracks, new characters, and artwork.  These definitely add to the longevity of this title and from the tune of this review, you already know the answer to the question I posed above.  Looney Tunes: Space Race renews my faith in the kart racing genre with its slick visuals, awesome theme, and solid gameplay.  But most of all, the game is a whole lot of looney fun.  --Anthony Chau ~Le Peu~, IGNDC Not a bad game by any means, Looney Tunes Space Race is one of those types of games that could be great fun for about half an hour: until you observe all its limitations. Packed full of features and modes, it's only a matter of time before the realization of doing the same thing over and over again hits you. Presented without any flaws, we could see how fans of the old school cartoons and young children alike could really dig it.But for those of us who are looking for something beyond a hearty rental, Space Race falls a little short. Dated not at all in a visual sense but more so in terms of the depth of gameplay, Melbourne House and Infogrames has a solid performer here, but not enough to keep us playing in the long run.", "date": "Nov 30, 2000"}
