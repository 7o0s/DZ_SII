And despite publisher's slavering hunger for innovative titles to emulate, no one's really built on the intriguing design of the original. Well, fans of Perimeter's unorthodox gameplay can finally extend their land-flattening, core-building, troop-morphing joy courtesy of a stand alone expansion pack, Perimeter: Emperor's Testament.  Perimeter falls squarely in the real-time strategy genre but it completely ignore many of the conventions that the genre embraces. Armed conflict is definitely present in the game, but it's almost incidental to the main action. Missions often place you in opposition with another force but your goal almost never requires you to destroy them. Rather than focusing on specific resource spots, Perimeter rewards players who grab as much real estate as possible. Though it takes a bit of getting used to, Perimeter's new concepts are definitely a nice change of pace for RTS vets.    Like the first game, Emperor's Testament suffers from a real mess of a story. I definitely like the abstract and bizarre concepts found in the game's narrative but it makes it difficult to actually grab hold of the story and get a sense of the point of it all. On the off chance that anyone who's interested in the expansion isn't already familiar with the original game, the basic premise is that descendants of humanity are on a massive exodus through a strange dimension. Three different factions arise, each of which tries to promote their own agenda: the Harkbacks want to return to their original world, the Empire want to set up shop in the new dimension, and the Exodus want to escape to establish themselves on a new homeworld.  When the expansion starts, the Empire are hard at work trying to carve out a new life for themselves in this strange dimension. I don't want to spoil the rest of the story (not that I really understand much of what's going on anyway) but the basic challenge for the player will be in overcoming the obstacles presented by an entirely new group that shares many of the characteristics of the three human factions.   The basic concepts are maintained here. Your basic core building is the Frame. It's the city where your people live. You'll plop your Frame down on a flat piece of land and then send your brigadiers and builders out to level the land and construct new buildings. Land leveling is very important in this game as your nanotech can only extract energy from flat ground. Energy cores act as the hubs for energy collection and also serve to power nearby buildings. The cores are all linked to each other and your Frame forming a large network that powers your entire base.  The coolest and most fundamental of strategies in Perimeter is to cut off a portion of your enemy's infrastructure by breaking a part of the network. If you can get your own energy cores and transmitters close enough, you can lay claim to any enemy installations that he can't get power to. This back and forth action as you capture and lose buildings is just as interesting as it was in Perimeter but the expansion doesn't really add anything new to the mix.  Emperor's Testament also falls prey to some of the balancing problems found in Perimeter. Some missions are ridiculously easy; you see the solution right at the start and then it's just a matter of going through the motions for the ten minutes it takes to reach your goals. Some missions are insanely hard, requiring you to try and fail numerous times before you hit on a winning solution. While I love the idea of having some missions be harder or easier than others, the gulf between the easy missions and hard missions here is much too vast for my tastes.      Like the original game, Emperor's Testament allows players to build three different basic unit types and then nanomorph them into more sophisticated units. Combining the soldiers, technicians and officers in the right numbers is still a huge pain, however, in that the game requires you to count out the right numbers yourself. Rather than forcing players to spend time recruiting 3 soldiers, 21 officers and 39 technicians in order to build a Piercer unit, why not just let players click on the Piercer icon and have the game automatically queue up the production of the troops required to create the Piercer?  On the plus side, the wide variety of units definitely gives you a lot of options in terms of creating your squads. Each unit type requires the construction of and upgrades for one or more types of laboratories. Build a first level Empire Laboratory and you can nanomorph your basic units into Leeches that siphon power from enemy energy cores. Upgrade that Empire Lab to level two and add a level 2 Antigravity Laboratory and you can create Disintegrators that can essentially devolve nanomorphed units into their basic components.   While the nanomorph concept is a lot of fun and the units all allow for some very inventive strategies, you'll still find yourself wasting resources to produce extra basic unit types. Given that there are only five available squad slots in the game, each of which can only be filled by one type of nanomorphed unit, having extra technicians or soldiers in a slot is an inevitable and unfortunate waste.  As you might have guessed, the learning curve in Perimeter is pretty high and even though this is a stand-alone expansion, it's clearly for fans of the original game. The absence of a tutorial will certainly turn off loads of new players. The manual certainly spells out most of what is required to build your base and your squads but it neglects to provide a clear overview of the significant, but not readily apparent, need to capture rather than destroy enemy buildings. Players of the original won't have a problem with this of course but it's a shortcoming that limits the audience of Emperor's Testament.   The graphics have definitely aged since the game was released over two years ago. Though the engine can handle complex geometries with ease, it seems that most of that power is spent on the highly deformable terrain. For many players, myself included, that's enough of a visual treat that we're willing to forgive the blocky unit design or the lack of a clear visual distinction among the buildings. The weapon effects still hold up reasonably well but the star of the show, effect-wise, is still the massive Perimeter shield that blocks out your enemies attacks.There's still no game quite like Perimeter so fans of puzzle-oriented strategy games should definitely consider Emperor's Testament. The concepts of energy management, unit morphing and land leveling definitely set Emperor's Testament apart from the rest of the RTS titles on the market. When you consider the twenty-dollar price tag, it's hard to pass this one up.On the negative side, the unit morphing feature requires far too much micromanagement for it to be completely enjoyable. Moreover, the story is just confusing and the missions are a bit unbalanced. Sure, I like that the missions aren't always focused on eliminating your enemy but some are much too easy and others are much too hard.", "date": "Sep 5, 2006"}
