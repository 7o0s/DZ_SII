{"name": "The Office Games", "name_review": "The Office Games", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/07/28/the-office-games", "text": "Before the breakout second season of NBC's The Office, Indiagames was assembling a small collection of cubicle-themed mini-games called simply Office Games. However, knowing that a license definitely focuses a little more heat and light on a mobile game in the crowded decks (or the cutthroat competition to get on them in the first place), the mobile developer/publisher quickly jumped on the television show ascension. Shrewd, smart marketing move, Indiagames -- kudos.   Sadly, having played both the before- and after-license editions of the games, the addition of the Office crew does very little to boost the concept above the level of mediocre. The only things that connect the game to the television show are some renaming conventions, the constant appearance of tiny character portraits quoting appropriate dialogue, and the redesign of the ~goalie~ in the paper football game to look like Pam, the receptionist. Otherwise, the game is still an uneven assembly of a few good games and some downright dull ones.   The better efforts are the desktop mini-golf game where water hazards and windmills are replaced with staples and bookkeeping materials and an office chair race. Instead of karts or pimped out rides, you control a corporate drone doing laps in a Herman Miller -- you can even see the guy's legs stick out and pull himself forward as he dodges desks and potted plants on a circuit of floor plans. Very clever, especially when you factor in the need to track your worker bee's heart rate to maximize effectiveness.   Not so good? Paper War, for starters. This boring mini-game has you flinging wadded up balls of paper at fellow office employees. You score points by hitting the co-worker that is about to throw at you first. They raise their arms up for a brief moment before the toss, giving you a quick chance to launch a pre-emptive strike. You can totally exploit this game by leaving the crosshair on the middle worker of the three and just clicking from side to side when necessary. Also too easy for its own good is a balancing act mini-game where a lowly intern walks down a hallway as employees toss stacks of paper into the ever-growing pile in his arms.   Wastebasket basketball and paper football (the little game where you fold a sheet of paper up into a ~taco~ and flick it through finger goal posts) are somewhere in the middle, offering up a little challenge, but not enough to keep you coming back over and over. Which, incidentally enough, is the core problem with The Office Games -- there are just not enough good mini-games to warrant sticking around for long, much less for me to recommend a download.  Simply put, this is not how an entertainment license should be handled. Applying a new paint job with some character portraits and a new title screen doesn't make the game any better. Licenses, to be effective, need to be implemented from the get-go, such as I-play's 24 or even some of Indiagames' previous Hollywood-based games, such as Predator or Buffy. Too few of the mini-games are fun enough to demand purchase, so if you have a hankering to play wastebasket basketball or paper football, it might be cheaper (and more entertaining) just to do it in the real world.", "date": "Jul 28, 2006"}
