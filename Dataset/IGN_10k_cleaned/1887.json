As one of the casualties of the great Saturday morning cartoon quality crash, they must live out life (in the US) on the Cartoon Network while crap such as Los Luchadores is ~entertaining~ the kids of today.   After testing their legs in numerous platformers, including one on the PS one, the little blue guys are now starring in their very own cart racing game. It's just too bad that it's not that great of a game.   Gameplay As a kart racer on a system with some really good games in this genre, Smurf Racer has a lot to live up to. While it is better than some of the racers on the PlayStation, it still can't hold a candle to likes of games like Crash Team Racing, Speed Punks, or Looney Tunes Racer.   When starting up the game you see the normal Single Race and Championship modes, as well as a new thing called a Flag Race. In this mode, you are not racing along a track, but rather you are in a large battle arena against one opponent where you must collect all the flags in the level before the other guy does. That mode can also be used as a ~Battle Mode~ of sorts when playing against another human.  The actual racing is pretty mediocre. You have eight different Smurfs to choose from (and then you can unlock four others), and each one has two different attacks as well as nine tracks with one secret race that is unlocked for the final level. Everyone can use Mushroom Rockets to fire ahead of them, and they all have a unique weapon that fires behind them to cause a tailing opponent to spin out. For example, Papa Smurf drops magic vials behind him while Handy Smurf releases nails.   That two-item weapon system is one of the problems with the game, there simply isn't enough variety. Most kart racing games allow you to use different weapons to spice up the levels and make them less boring. Here you can only use two different attacks and that makes the races seem a lot longer than they actually are simply because you stop having fun halfway through the track. Also, the game is rather short and quite easy, which cuts down on the replay value a bit.  Thankfully the tracks do have a bit of variety in them. You go through the Smurf's happy little forest, to a frozen mountain and castle, all the way to the evil and dark forbidden zone. Some of the more interesting tracks include a race through a treetop village that would make even the Ewoks happy, to a speedy competition through a murky swamp.   Controlling your chosen Smurf through those levels is surprisingly easy to do. Steering is very responsive (especially if you use the analog stick), and each cart handles well. The ease of control is another thing that makes the game very easy, as you'll rarely be slamming against the track walls or slowing down because you messed up in a turn.  Graphics One of the things that the PlayStation has done pretty well is create good ~cartoony~ looking environments for games based off of animated series or movies. Most of the Disney games did this well, and the same technique is used to some extent here.  The track graphics themselves are decent. Flat, with an almost animated look, they fit into the Smuf theme well. The framerate is decent for a PlayStation kart game, and the game moves quick enough to give a good sense of speed. Unfortunately, the racer and cart graphics are just plain bad. They are flat-shaded, with no textures at all, and they look to be comprised out of fewer polygons than some old Saturn games.   Sound Happy, boppy, little tunes populate each track and rarely get annoying enough for you to turn the sound off. Each kart sounds as if it was a little wind up toy, and there are even some sound effects taken right from the animated series. Thankfully, there aren't any annoying voice clips coming from the various racers.Being a big fan of the Smurfs, I look forward to playing any game based on the series, as they are kind of rare over here in the US. Unfortunately Smurf Racer simply doesn't offer the same sort of variety or lasting appeal that other PlayStation kart racers have in the past. For ten bucks, it's a decent addition to your collection if you are a die-hard Smurfs fan, but other people would probably want steer clear and go for something such as Crash Team Racing.", "date": "Apr 6, 2001"}
