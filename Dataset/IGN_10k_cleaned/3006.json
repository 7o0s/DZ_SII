{"name": "The Sims: Unleashed", "name_review": "The Sims Unleashed Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/10/03/the-sims-unleashed-review", "text": "There's a classic scene in The Simpsons where Reverend Lovejoy is out walking his dog and they stop on Ned Flanders' lawn. ~C'mon boy, this is the spot right here,~ the Reverend tells his dog. ~Good boy. Do your dirty sinful business. Don't stop the music,~ he says as the dog does his business all over Neddie's lawn.  The reason I bring that up is because it neatly encapsulates my experience with Sims Unleashed. I felt like a whole lot of Reverend Lovejoy's dogs came and did their dirty business all over my lawn.  Yes, The Sims Unleashed brings pets into the world of The Sims, but it does so in such a stubbornly rigid fashion that the end result is a bit disappointing. There are good things with this expansion pack, and there are bad things, and when added together they come up on the plus side, but in the end you can't help but wonder, why isn't there more? How many more expansions that dole out one tiny little slice of suburban life can there be? Sim Grammar School? Sim Honeymoon? Sim Workplace? Sim In-Laws? Sim Traffic Court? Sim Grocery Store? At what point do we just give up on the incrementalism and move on to The Sims 2?   Of Cats and Dogs First, the good.  Not surprisingly, Sims Unleashed is packed with pets and that really is the theme of this expansion. Generally pets come in two classes. One class might as well be objects, since they don't really do anything and are more like decorations than living things to interact with. These are the turtles, iguanas, goldfish, and parrots that pretty much stay in place. You'll have to feed them and clean them occasionally, and with the parrots you can go over and 'talk' to them (which works like a mirror, improving your personality score), but all in all, they're boring and static.  Far more involved and entertaining are the cats and dogs. These two species of pets are handled nearly identically (the main difference being that cats can hunt vermin), and in terms of interactivity and involvement with your family, they're probably halfway between babies and kids.   What's nice is that each cat or dog is considered a member of your family and has their own portrait, their own personality, and their own set of relationships with all the other people in your family, be they cat or dog or human. They will even form relationships with people outside of your family, of any of the three species. It's really funny to see the cat or dog first turn up on your family screen, and to click through and find out their personalities and skills and all the rest of it. The bad news is that they do count as a full member of the family, and you still can't have more than eight people per lot, including cats and dogs -- but that's okay, that's about all one lot and one player can handle at a time anyway.  The flip side is that dogs and cats are completely independent. Unlike children, whom you can control and tell to study or go to school or otherwise treat as pretty much any other adult, you as the player can't really directly tell dogs or cats to do anything except ~go there~ -- and that's presumably to avoid congestion in narrow halls and the like. For the most part, cats and dogs have a mind of their own and go about and do their own thing. And that's actually a great design decision, because half the fun of pets is that they're fairly unpredictable and you're forced to clean up after them a lot, whereas if you actually had control of them, and you yourself had to make them go to the bathroom, and eat, and climb on a scratching post to fight boredom, well, you'd be pretty bored yourself -- particularly since pets never go to work or school and are pretty much always at home getting into things, being the lazy unemployed scalawags that they are.  Anyway, each cat or dog also has their own personality and skills too, which is a clever touch. Some pets are sociable, some are active, some are smart, some are dumb, and this affects their behavior: it's easier to train smart animals to do tricks, whereas sociable creatures need much more attention, and are more friendly with strangers. And unlike people, whose personalities you can dictate when you first create them, with cats and dogs it's kind of buyer beware. You can't make a pet at the family creation screen. Instead, in order to add a cat or dog to your family, you have to do downtown to the Pet Adoption Agency, and there you can choose to adopt a new pet.   There are about ten or twelve different graphics of cat and dog representing the different breeds (most of the popular ones seem to be represented: bulldogs, cocker spaniels, Persians, etc.), although you'll quickly notice that all the animals are roughly the same size and use roughly the same character model...they all seem to be youthful-looking adult specimens, albeit on the smallish side. After you choose a pet, you'll pick its gender and then name it, and then you go home. Only after you've adopted it do you find out what its personality is like, so if you're stuck with a stupid dog and you were hoping to win all the pet show contests with your amazing tricks, you're out $400 and there's nothing you can do...except shower the poor thing with love, you heartless brute!      Pets and their owners can interact in many interesting and meaningful ways. Of course you can play fetch with your dog, pet them, wrestle with them, and do all the other things you'd expect. You also have to buy them dog food and give them baths, and there are lots of toys, scratching posts, and objects like catnip for them to play with. You can even teach them tricks, and take them with you on Vacations (if you have that expansion pack) and to the new ~Old Town~ areas the Unleashed expansion creates (more on that later).  But for all these activities you can do with your pets, what's surprising is that you can't take your dog for a walk. Although if you think about it, you can't simply take your Sim and have him or her stroll around the neighborhood either, so it makes sense that you can't walk the dog (even though ~dog-walker~ is part of one of the five new career tracks). You can take your dog to a park somewhere, where plenty of other people and their pets will be running about (apparently there are no leash laws in Sim City), but that's not quite the same thing as actually walking around the neighborhood with a dog tugging you around on a leash, sniffing at every bush and fire hydrant. I guess we'll have to wait and hope that Sims 2 will have interconnected lots and an overhead map that actually corresponds with the individual lots.  Still, that inability to stroll about with man's best friend is not the most annoying thing about The Sims Unleashed. Instead, what I found baffling was how the expansion pack transforms previously quiet and pleasant neighborhoods into wild suburban jungles where bands of roving mutts wander willy-nilly through the streets, eating other people's pet food, running through strange yards at will, and urinating all over everything.   These stray pets left little blue puddles up and down the street everywhere, which of course meant anytime any of my Sims went outside their ~Room Score~ would plummet, deleteriously affecting their mood, and ultimately their schoolwork and their career. They've also attached the ~Uh-oh, it's a burglar sound!~ to the act of a strange dog urinating on your property, which is sort of like overkill. A burglar coming in stealing all your stuff, that's trouble. A little doo-doo on the sidewalk, come on now, no need to get so upset.  If you really, really don't like pets and the prospect of constantly cleaning up after them, you might want to think twice about installing Sims Unleashed. However you can cut down on the nuisance factor significantly by going into your neighborhood and evicting all of the pre-made families with pets. A few stray animals with no real home will still wander onto your property, but the overall incidence of pet-related vandalism will decrease.  Unfortunately some other bugs remain in the game too. Some items (like showers and dishwashers) when they break, can now cause puddles to form under the object, which is insane, because there's no way your Sim's mop can reach under there, and so you have to go into Build Mode, manually move the counters and things out of the way, and then go back into Live mode, direct your Sim to mop, then go back into Build, put everything back the way it was, and then finally you can play again. Obvious bug that needs to be patched. I also was getting tired of my Sims ~sticking~ to certain planet boxes, both on their own lots and in some of the Downtown areas.   Green Acres Less hyped within Unleashed but also fun to play with is a more robust farming /gardening mode. You know how in the current game, you can have a bunch of plants outside your house that, if you don't water fairly regularly, will get old and yellow and die? Watering plants gets boring though and so most of the time you'll either keep the flowering plants to a minimum or hire a gardener to take care of them for you. Or leave tons and tons of dead plants outside the double-wide for that lived-in, down-home look. (I'm still waiting for someone to make a ~cars-on-blocks~ object to make my white trash beer-can lawn complete, though).  Anyway, gardening now has meaning again, since you're now able to eke out a little profit and even some food for your troubles. Certain lots now have patches of dirt where seeds can be planted which, if properly cared for, will turn into carrots, lettuce, tomatoes, and other growing things. Your Sims can then go harvest these vegetables and either take them down to the Farmer's Market and sell them for a few Simoleans, or take them indoors and store them in a new object called a Pantry, which is sort of like a low-tech refrigerator for vegetables. Occasionally you'll even get a bumper crop with $150 reward (and I can imagine that the object editing people out there will be happy to come up with some more profitable cash crops in the future).  This is neat because it does provide a new way for Sims to keep themselves alive without working on one of the demanding and time-sucking career tracks, and will be very welcome indeed for those who like to play with low-tech families (it's hard to make medieval, homeless, hippie, pioneer, barbarian, etc. villages under the current consumer-oriented game mechanic). Gardening though seems to be less profitable than the old Garden Gnome manufactory, and it's a shame that there's no Agriculture skill involved, but overall it is still a very cool thing.      Somewhat less enthralling is the presence of rabbits that come and eat your crops. I tried and tried in vain to keep the rabbits away with fences and dogs and scarecrows and anything else I could think of, but to no avail, and of course there's no shotgun or poison for you to use. Apparently only cats with their hunting skills will fend off gophers and rabbits. Sure, sure. I've seen my cats catch mice but a rabbit? Our cats were more likely to lick their paws then even acknowledge the presence of a rabbit. On the other hand, we used to have a Brittany Spaniel that would chase rabbits for miles and miles, never tiring. No varmint ever got past her. [Ed's note: I used to have a cat that caught and ate all kinds of things, bunnies included.]  Anyway, between cats and dogs, scarecrows and garden patches, you have about everything you need to play Green Acres Sims. Now if only someone could hack together some cows to milk and horses to ride...   The World at Large For me, the most pleasant surprise in The Sims Unleashed was the sudden inclusion of thirty brand new lots in each and every one of my neighborhoods. I don't know about you, but I always manage to fill up all my neighborhoods with families, even creating dense apartment blocks packed with eight Sims apiece, just to give my main Sims more people to interact with. And when that failed, I then used third-party editors to edit all the ~Townies~ into people who fit better into the themes of my various neighborhoods. So suddenly having thirty new lots is really going to broaden your horizons and expand your virtual small towns into quite the little thriving community.  Now not every new lot is a residential lot -- five of them are dedicated as ~Old Town~ areas, meaning you can build shops, parks, and other public places there. The nice thing though is that you can rezone any of these new lots into either residential or commercial, so your hands aren't tied that way either.   So what is ~Old Town?~ It's kind of like the Downtown area from Hot Date, except that it's interspersed amidst all your Residential Lots. So now when you call a Cab, you're taken to the main residential lot screen, and those places designated as public/commercial spaces are highlighted, making them easier for you to find. Since this expansion is called Sims Unleashed a disproportionate amount of these new Old Town businesses are related to pets and gardening, but presumably in time you can do enough editing and rezoning to create your own Old Town areas consisting of restaurants, resorts, bars, nightclubs, or whatever the heck you want.  As much as I enjoyed this expansion of the old Sims neighborhood, in the end I couldn't help but wishing there was more user modification-friendly stuff like that, and less nonsense like the guy with the dancing monkey, who is basically a re-skinned entertainer from the older expansions. I want zoning! I want to be able to control the number and size of my lots in my virtual city, and I want to control the background graphics of the town too, and the behavior and placement and appearance of every NPC too.   What did you think of Unleashed?  Not every neighborhood should be some gleaming suburban paradise; I want urban sprawl, rural squalor, and the rugged frontier too. I want trailer parks and medieval townships. I want colony domes on Mars. That to me is what a complete expansion pack should be: a whole new world, not just some dogs that come over and crap on my lawn.   But at the rate they're doling out the tools and new themes once every six months, it'll be twenty years before we can completely re-skin the Sims into anything. Oh well. In the end, if you love pets and have been dying to have cats and dogs in your game, you're going to love Unleashed and will want to rush out and buy it right away. In terms of bringing pets into the world of The Sims, they did a great job. Likewise, if your eyes go wide at the thought of having neighborhoods with a ton of brand new lots to play with, you're going to love this pack too. But by now, the only people still playing The Sims (besides those people who just bought a computer and with it their first game) are serious, hardcore Sims players who are going to buy every expansion pack regardless. And we've already downloaded hundreds if not thousands of new skins and objects, so that part of the expansion isn't very impressive. So once the novelty of cleaning up after cats and dogs wears off, we're left with a $30 utility that makes bigger, mixed use neighborhoods, but not much more.", "date": "Oct 3, 2002"}
