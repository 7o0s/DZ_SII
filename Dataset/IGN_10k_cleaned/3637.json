A year later, Konami continued the series with Harmony of Dissonance, upping the visuals and gameplay mechanics but reducing the difficulty and audio quality from the previous game. Even with that compromise, the sequel was a fantastic follow-up that continued the series faithfully and impressively.  Only eight months after the release of Harmony of Dissonance, Konami unleashes a third game in the franchise. Aria of Sorrow takes what the development team built for Harmony of Dissonance, improves on the audio quality and bumps up the difficulty. The game may feature a drastic departure in storyline from previous games in the series, both on the GBA and on past consoles, but it's still Castlevania at its heart; and the game features some excellent, new ideas in gameplay that move the Castlevania franchise forward. The only real issue is in the game's length; just like the previous Castlevania adventures on the GBA, players can get the most basic ending in a single day. But the inclusion of new play mechanics, more specifically soul absorbing, increase the replay value significantly and keep the coveted 100% ending at a much further distance. Features More than 100 souls to collect Link cable support to trade extra souls between players Cartridge save (three save slots, each with one ~instant save~ slot) Only for Game Boy Advance Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow is the first game whose main quest doesn't revolve around either A) A Belmont in the lead, or B) the destruction of Dracula...at least from the start. The adventure actually takes place in Dracula's castle which had been banished to a solar eclipse in 1999. Thirty years later another solar eclipse has appeared, which whisks our hero, Soma Cruz through a portal into Dracula's castle where evil continues to flourish. To get home, Soma needs to make his way through the castle to the Master's Chamber. Of course, on the way, Soma will meet up with other people who have been trapped inside the castle, and the plot of Dracula's legacy unfolds. The game's story takes place in the future, but that's only for plot purposes; don't expect any references to advancing technology in this game. Aria of Sorrow is firmly rooted in the established Castlevania universe.  Since Soma isn't officially a vampire slayer, he doesn't wield the familiar Castlevania whip to take out the seemingly endless supply of beasties in the castle. Instead, players can equip Soma with one of several different types of weapons that are collected deep in the levels. A large variety of swords, hammers, and axes are hidden in the game to grab, each with their pros and cons that can increase Soma's attack strength. But just because a weapon is powerful to Soma doesn't mean it's the right tool for the job; some of the strategy in the game is discovering which weapon works best against specific creatures and boss characters. An extremely powerful hammer, for example, can be much slower to swing than a weaker blade. And there's even a 9mm pistol hidden out there; it's cool to use since it feels so different in a Castlevania game, but it's pretty weak compared to the other weapons you can slash around.  The biggest addition to the Castlevania gameplay in Aria of Sorrow is its soul collection mechanic. As players work their way through the castle and take out the different enemies, occasionally a soul will split from the enemy for Soma to absorb. These souls give Soma additional abilities to utilize during the gameplay. It may seem like a rip-off to what Metroid Fusion brought to its series, but aside from the ~absorption~ effect the soul collection has been handled much differently than the fusion mechanic. And it's this Soul Absorption gameplay element that gives the game a lot more strategy than previous games in the series, and it also increases its replay value since some creatures or areas that aren't needed to minimally cannot be seen or accessed without specific abilities...but if you want to finish the game 100% you'll need to discover the way to grab that specific soul. And some souls just don't want to conveniently separate from their hosts...     There are three different types of souls in the game, and players can have one of each working at the same time. One type is always mapped to the Up and Attack command, much like the secondary weapon used in past Castlevania games; these souls mirror the specific monster's attacks, so if you've scored the soul of a skeleton, for example, you'll be able to lob bones at enemies. Or, you can throw daggers if you grabbed the soul of an Evil Butcher. Another type is activated by the R trigger, giving players the ability to use defensive attacks or activate a power that can transform players into a bat to access higher, out of reach platforms. The third kind enhances Soma's overall abilities, from giving him the ability to walk on or under water, to simply upping his specific stats.  Of course, just like in Harmony of Dissonance, players will also have to do their best to collect armor, accessories, and potions, and utilize them to get further into the castle. The shops aren't hidden in Aria of Sorrow; actually, there's only one shop in the game that unlocks after finding a specific character, and this guy will come in handy to acquire specific items that you weren't able to score by slashing at candles and enemies. But since he's readily available to anyone at a specific part of the game, his appearance actually makes the game a lot easier to beat since players can simply stock up on potions, a tactic that players will stumble upon when battling those one or two bosses that become troublesome.  Yes, Aria of Sorrow's boss battles are generally (and a little disappointingly) a cakewalk; there's only a couple that will really give players any real trouble...and even the absolute final boss has an incredibly simple pattern that can be easily read and defeated. But where boss battles aren't troublesome, the standard array of enemies can certainly cause problems. Though the beginning of the adventure's a bit on the easy side, there are places deep in the game that are tough and challenging due to very, very aggressive standard enemies.  Though the gameplay is distinctly different from Harmony of Dissonance, Aria of Sorrow utilizes a similar (if not the exact same) game engine that HOD put to use. That's not to say it's a bad thing, as the engine pushes a lot of very impressive special effects, from huge animated sprites that fill the screen, to background scaling to give a feeling of vertigo. Aria of Sorrow will definitely feel very familiar for players who have made it through the last game in the Castlevania series. And in terms of level design, the Castlevania developers obviously shot their wad in the last game; other than the clever Walk-on-or-underwater idea used in a portion of the game, there aren't a whole lot of new room layout ideas in Aria of Sorrow. It's a well-balanced and impressive world, absolutely...just don't expect any new ways of jumping from one place to the next.  But even though the game engine in Aria is derived from HOD, what has improved significantly in the new Castlevania is the soundtrack; the music quality and soundtrack composition is definitely a few notches higher than what the Harmony of Dissonance team put together for their game. There's also a lot more digitized samples and speech in Aria, though the US version still has some Japanese phrases spoken by characters and monsters.  And yes, the game can be completed in a single day, five hours of game time usually calculates to about 10-12 total when it includes deaths, viewing the map, or manipulating the items screen. The basic ending is incredibly unfulfilling and disappointing, but it opens up an additional, playable character. And the obvious gaps in the soul stats, as well as the percentage status on the map will drive players to finish the game with Soma to its fullest. And to do this, players might want to consult with other owners of Aria of Sorrow, snagging a couple of souls in the link cable mode. So, while getting through most of the castle and defeating the final boss is a short journey, it's not over until you've finished other things. And that might take you a much longer time. Castlevania: Circle of the Moon was a fantastic intro to the series on the Game Boy Advance, and an excellent launch title. But Konami one-upped the game with Harmony of Dissonance at least in terms of wow-factor. But the game was a little on the easy side to beat; and Aria of Sorrow brings back that challenge. The majority of boss battles are a little too easy and predictable, but there are those two or three that will cause a few restarts in your adventure. The gameplay is a significant step forward above Harmony of Dissonance. The soul collection element is very clever and adds so much to the gameplay, but there's very little in the way of level design innovation; you've seen many of the ooh-neat things in the last game in the series. And though it's a satisfying quest, it ends surprisingly quick. But luckily that's when the bare minimum is accomplished -- the developers put in a whole bunch that will keep players wandering the castle to get that ultimate finish.Harmony of Dissonance was, and still is fantastic. Aria of Sorrow is better.", "date": "May 5, 2003"}
