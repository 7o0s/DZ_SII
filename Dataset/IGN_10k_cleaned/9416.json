Many of those millions are children, and, further, many of those are very young children. It's not uncommon to see kids even under the age of five owning their own dual-screened system, and playing quite happily, and with great skill, games that were originally intended for players several years older than they are.  Chances are you know a player just like that: your niece, nephew, or even your own kids.   So recognizing that the age of entry for video games is lower now than it's ever been before, UFO Interactive has decided to publish the Smart Kids series  games aimed at kids who are very young, starting at the age of three. Smart Boy's Gameroom is the title for young boys, and, for little women, it's Smart Girl's Playhouse. The latter is what we'll focus on here, and its collection of accessible, cute, and very, very simple mini-games.    There are twelve of them, altogether, and the first positive point to address is that each of these games looks great. Visually, the simple cartoon style that is applied to each design is very accessible, and completely inoffensive  on the same level as what you'd see in a children's book meant for the same young age range. The elements that players interact with, too, are always clear and usually very large, making them easy to see.   Several games are based on sound, like Match Sounds (left) and Play Piano (right).  And easy to touch with little fingers, which is an important point that developers Starfish must have recognized  the youngest DS players don't quite care for the stylus, and often prefer to poke the screen themselves with their index fingers or thumbs. The piano playing mini-game is most encouraging for that, as it transforms the touch screen into a small subset of a keyboard and lets players create their own music. You can save your creations and play them back, and change the sound to mimic the tones of an organ instead, or even the screeches of a cat.   The cat option is a bit abrasive, and there's at least one other occasion when this Playhouse will emit some less-than-satisfying sounds. In the Match Sounds game (pictured above, on the left) for example, players are asked to remember the correct order in which the animals cry out, and then repeat that sequence. Just like the classic game Simon. Except, in between touching the animals in the order you're trying to remember, a congratulatory bell will ring every time you get one right. That could, potentially, break up the flow of a child's memory  having to wait after every correct input for a few seconds before you're allowed to touch the next right animal in sequence.   Luckily, that occurrence is isolated, and the remaining games in this Playhouse package play out with few, if any, additional concerns. There's a card-matching memory game. There's a counting game, and simple jigsaw puzzler with only five or so pieces per puzzle. There's a design that lets you play instruments along with four different background songs, a Dress Up mode to put together outfits for a little girl character to wear, a Whac-a-Mole clone that's called Feed the Hamsters, and replaces the violent aspect of the original with a nurturing, care-giving hook instead, and more. Each of these designs is very straightforward and easy to play  though they might lack depth for some of the girls who'd try them, and they could get bored after a while.   The deeper designs are the piano mode, mentioned earlier, and probably also the Drawing and Coloring mini-games. Drawing offers a blank canvas to scribble across, with a small set of different colors and stamps to use in creating your masterpiece. Coloring offers the same array of shades, but provides the picture for you. Touching an empty region will instantly fill it completely with color, so no scribbling to fill it in yourself. Both modes will also save your creations while you play other games, so you can revisit them later  but they will be lost if you turn off the power to the system.   Finally, from the out-of-nowhere inclusion category, is Lunch Box. This is the game that will remind you that Smart Girl's Playhouse was developed in Japan, not America, because it gives girls the chance to pack a virtual lunch for themselves. But none of the food choices look like anything commonly eaten in the States. There are rice balls, and sushi, and those little red squid-looking things you might've seen in an anime show  but no American foods at all. That's more than a little odd, and something you'd think could have been simply swapped for the Stateside release. But hey, I guess little girls playing this game will develop a knowledge of another culture's culinary preferences.The youngest DS players out there are all probably playing the very same games as older gamers, even twice or three times their age. And they're likely loving every minute of it, playing Mario Kart and the like with a skill level well beyond their years. But it's encouraging, now, that a publisher has recognized the potential need for titles more appropriate for the very young. Three-year-olds should certainly be encouraged to engage themselves in activities other than video games, but if they're going to be playing anyway, or if they're already seeing their older brothers, sisters and cousins playing and they don't want to be left out, the Smart Kids titles are a safe bet for introducing them into the pastime. Smart Girl's Playhouse for girls, in particular, is a game that I'd feel safe in giving as a gift to my own niece, who will be turning three next summer. And as it's offered at a budget price, I'd recommend it to other parents, aunts or uncles who also have little women in their lives in the same age range.", "date": "Nov 3, 2007"}
