You no like drag racing, you away now and be much happier person, yes? Yes. You even remotely on the fence about drag racing, you still go far, far away from IHRA Drag Racing 2005 for it is one of the worst ideas for a racing title to hit the PlayStation 2 and it makes little to no effort to make this sport accessible to anyone. It's ugly, clunky, and it'll go nicely sitting right next to Lowrider.    Focusing on the niche of drag racingIHRA focuses on buying drag racers, modifying them, and racing them. Since the actual races only take a few seconds to finish the real question is what the game does to flesh out the world and it's not all that much. In the actual race there only a few different things to do and that is to warm up the tires by revving up the engine, moving the car up to the starting line, and then punching the gas when the green light comes on. That's really the majority of the game right there and it's about as fun as it sounds.   Sure, there are other features such as modifications for the cars that can be purchased and the cars can be tweaked for superior performance. With some of the options like the gear ratios this is pretty obvious, but then there are other options such as tire pressure which is something that's left to the imagination since there is barely any documentation in the manual and the game itself barely bothers to tell you what's going on.   If this game was going to be a virtual ambassador for the sport and bring in some new fans, it would help if the game was more user-friendly with a good tutorial. Instead, there is a clunky Racing License mode that slowly and sloppily explains the few aspects of what can be called skill in such a barebones game of hitting the gas pedal hard. It would be better if the game was at least put together in a decent way, but that's just not the case.    With many budget titles, the first thing to take a hit is usually the graphics and that's true here as well, but the big problem is really the presentation. For one thing, nearly every button press initiates a load in the game. Navigating the menu system involves load times which just goes to show how poorly developed this title is. Even when in the game, hitting start will make the game load up the pause menu. Hitting start again will cause another load for over 10 seconds to get back in the game. Keep in mind that most, and by most I mean almost all, games can pause the game instantly and go right back. How this basic function was mishandled is beyond comprehension.   This sloppy approach is all over the game and makes the whole experience one that can only be enjoyed by the incredibly determined and the poor testers who were stuck on this project. After finishing a race, there are the options to just restart the race or go to the Main Menu. Instead of just keeping the races coming, the game chops up the action into little bits so that the few seconds of racing start to feel somewhat exhilarating just because nothing else happens here that's even remotely interesting.   There is also a mini-game, but since it's just a reaction timer it can hardly be called a game of any sort unless you think that tapping your fingers on a table is also a game. Here there are lights that are like the countdown lights in the race and as soon as they turn green, tap the button! Yeah, that's it. After setting a time of .008 seconds and feeling kind of proud for another .125 seconds we moved on and made a pact to never look back.If you really want to get this game, we applaud you. You are so devoted to the sport of drag racing that you are willing to overlook any and all problems that are included with IHRA Professional Drag Racing 2005 and that is an inspiration to someone. That someone isn't us, but we respect that in a way. Sort of. Just take comfort that since there is no reason that this game will appeal to anyone else this is your own private playground so enjoy it.", "date": "Nov 20, 2004"}
