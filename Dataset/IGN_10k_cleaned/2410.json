Konami's Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams for the Xbox will make you unhappy, but in this case it's because the designers are so successful at creeping you out and exposing gamers to the darker side of the human spirit. The Xbox SH2 doesn't stray very far from the version that appeared on the PlayStation 2, but the Restless Dreams bonus mission and graphical upgrades make it the ultimate Silent Hill experience to date.   Few genres rely on presentation as heavily as survival horror games. Capcom set the standard with the Resident Evil series years ago, and Silent Hill has risen to success above all the other RE clones by sticking to the script. And that script says keep the gamers spooked from beginning to end with a combination of creepy audio and visual elements.   Features    Return to Silent Hill and explore parts of the town that were closed off in the original.  Incredible graphics and true-to-life CG visuals leave you on the edge of your seat.  Real-time weather effects, morphing and shadows will confuse your senses.  Atmospheric lighting and ambient surround sound makes every moment suspenseful.  Dynamic camera effects and beautifully rendered environments deliver a cinematic horror experience.  Xbox-exclusive sub scenario ~Born From a Wish~ offers 4-6 hours of gameplay in addition to main storyline.  Cinematic Noise Filter can be turned off to remove the ~grainy effect.~   Without Noise Filter and With Noise Filter The Story If you're not already familiar with the storyline from the original Silent Hill 2, we'll give you a brief summary before moving onto the Xbox exclusive sub-mission: Born from a Wish. In the main game, our hero, James Sunderland gets a letter from his wife Mary asking him to meet her in their special place in the town of Silent Hill. That may not sound very creepy to you, but Mary's been dead for three years. Our man, Jimmy hasn't had much of a life since Mary died, so he ends up risking it while making his way through the suddenly deserted and zombie-infested town of Silent Hill.  In Born from a Wish you get to play as Maria, one of the characters James meets in his travels through the town. Her adventure in Silent Hill is very much a side story in that it feels like something that would have been left on the cutting room floor of a movie. It's too interesting to peacefully coexist alongside the main story and not interesting enough to make a full game. It's a nice bit of extra survival horror that you're getting for free if you make Silent Hill 2 on Xbox your first Silent Hill 2 experience.   Gameplay They're called survival horror games but the truth is you spend more time solving puzzles than Columbo in games like Silent Hill 2. You'd think the only problems to be solved would be all of the monsters roaming around town, but in Silent Hill 2, finding items you need and unlocking doors is the order of the day. The good part is that it ends up as a very linear game even though the town is huge and you have to walk everywhere. When you don't know what you're supposed to do next, SH2 can be very frustrating but then again, if you're playing Restless Dreams you're probably familiar with survival horror games and a bit of frustration comes with the territory.   The variety of puzzles is what keeps you involved. One time it maybe placing plaques in the right order on a statue, another time it's simply a matter of recognizing an item that you've had in your inventory for the last half hour. The puzzles serve as an additional stimulus so that you're not just creeped out all of the time in Silent Hill.  The Xbox controller has plenty of buttons, making all of James' or Maria's actions nice and accessible. Ease of use is always important, but there isn't much emphasis on speed in Silent Hill 2 because none of the threats in the game are very quick. It is nice to access some functions like maps of the area without first having to go to an item menu. Tapping the yellow Y button once is a lot nicer than having to hit the Back button to bring up the item menu and then searching for the map. This means you can concentrate on killing enemies with the variety of range and melee weapons. Born from a Wish gets props for letting you use a meat clever early and often.  You end up doing a lot of running through the buildings and streets of Silent Hill. In fact you do more running than anything in SH2 because you're either looking for clues, backtracking to use some key or special item you just found, or simply trying to figure out where you're supposed to go next.  But the running around is how you experience the game's most important element: the creepiness. You're running around dark and dingy hallways and thick layers of fog that seems to cling to the ground all around Silent Hill. It's when you're shuttling back and forth that you'll hear all of the scary sounds of creatures far off in the distance. And this is when you realize that you're not just running in circles for no good reason. Silent Hill relentlessly messes with your sense of well being.  Graphics Volumetric fog was the hot ticket item of next generation vidoegame systems for about 15 minutes until realistic water physics took over. Nonetheless, the fog in Silent Hill is so well done and so prevalent that it actually seems like an additional character in the game. It does for Silent Hill 2 what the three hurricanes did for the blockbuster film ~The Perfect Storm.~  But beyond that you get exquisitely detailed characters and environments that will fool many grandparents and other non-hardcore gaming types into thinking you're watching a big time Hollywood movie. But Kevin Costner couldn't hang in Silent Hill the way James Sunderland does with you at the controls. The animation isn't very elaborate or very quick for any characters in the game, but they look damn good standing still. And smaller movements like mouths opening and eyes blinking all work very well.   The monsters are extremely original and do an excellent job continuing the creepiness. Most of the early enemies looked like shiny haunted mannequins with anatomically incorrect physiques. Take a look for yourself and see what they remind you of. More often than not, it's their appearance that creeps you out, not their random flailing animations, but that's the way things are in Silent Hill.   One of the key additions to this Xbox version is the option to turn off the grainy Noise Filter implemented in the PS2 game that almost made the game look like WWII  newsreel. If you do turn the filter off, you'll be able to appreciate all of the visual elements that much more, plus it's a great way to feel like you're getting something the PS2 gamers missed.  Sound There are some very disturbing sounds coming out of the Xbox version of Silent Hill 2 and we highly recommend turning off the lights and cranking up your surround sound system if you really want to immerse yourself in this game. From the static on the radio that serves as a sort of ~monster sonar~ to the demented background music, there are a lot of cool sounds in Silent Hill 2 that will keep you nice and unsettled.   It's the level of audio detail that drives home the spookiness. You're doing a lot of running around, but on a variety of surfaces like hardwood floors, concrete, linoleum and each makes a different sound. You'll notice the difference between walking on concrete and running on hardwood instantly. All of the sound effects, including echoes in appropriate places and background noises suitable for different areas make Silent Hill believable surreal.  The question with Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams is whether or not it's worth a purchase if you've already picked up the PS2 version. The short answer is no, because the Born from a Wish mission isn't long enough to stand on its own as a game and the new gameplay options like the Noise Filter switch were simply omissions from the PS2 game. However, SH2:RD is definitely worth a look if you want to appreciate the audio and video capabilities of the Xbox and impress your techno-snob friends. There's no additional fun hidden in the Xbox SH2, but the overall gloom of the franchise has never been so vivid.", "date": "Jan 5, 2002"}
