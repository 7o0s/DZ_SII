No, it wasn't against PGA golfers, nor was it on a licensed PGA course like Sawgrass or Scottsdale. It was on a fake, ugly course against fake, ugly golfers, and it was a real good time.   Real World Golf is not like any golf videogame you've played before. Instead of using an old-school button system or the new, hip right analog stick, you use your rickety golf swing, the same swing you use on the local course and forces you to spend large sums of cash on new golf balls to replace those you hit in the drink. So how does RWG pull this off without stealing Nintendo Revolution technology? The Mad Catz Gametrak controller.   RWG is not playable without the Gametrak, but that's the point. Using a pair of gloves, a pair of wires and a sophisticated motion capture sensor, the Gametrak effectively replicates your golf swing on screen. Grab the plastic mini-club included with RWG and move your wrists around and watch the avatar open and close the club face. Bring the club back a bit and watch your golfer bring the club back. There's no delay; your golfer will instantly mimic your movements. Then simply take a golf swing and witness the ensuing glory/despair. Be careful with the Gametrak when you hole it from distance; try not to tangle the wires with your victorious fist-pump.   Too bad the Gametrak can only re-create your swing. As a videogame, RWG is not much to shake a stick at. Compare it to any other golf title and, in terms of graphics, sound, courses and golfers, RWG pales in comparison to the likes of Tiger Woods PGA Tour. But as a golf simulation, a golf tool and swing coach, RWG is closer to the pin than anything on the console market. Tiger takes you as far as you can possibly go with a right analog stick. But RWG isn't trying to be a cool videogame for ADD-riddled teenagers; it's trying to be the coolest Fathers' Day gift since a fresh three-pack of tighty-whities.   It would be something to see Phil Mil strap himself into the Gametrak and take a few hacks. Forget the image of the Gametrak's wires stretching around Hefty Lefty's gut. It would be a great test to see how accurate the Gametrak measure's the swing of the Masters champ. We tested the unit out last month at the Presidio Golf Course in San Francisco, bumped the difficulty level up to pro, and gave the game to one of the golf instructors there. Here's what he had to say:   Some fuzzy graphics that get the job done in the end. ~There are many different elements to a golf swing, but a few elements this game is measuring are posture movement and getting the club face square and the speed of the club at impact. These can be big problems for people, moving up and down as you swing, changing your posture during the swing. The game gives you a repeatable exercise that helps you with your posture and keeping the club face square.   I was very impressed. You're actually swinging a club instead of just pushing buttons. Of the few swings I made that felt good to me, they were good in the game. There weren't any bad swings I made that were good in the game, and there weren't any good swings I made that went bad. The feedback is very realistic.~     So yeah, it worked for the golf pro. But how will RWG work for the average golfer? The first thing you have to realize about this game is that it is not Tiger Woods and you will not be breaking course records unless you really are Tiger Woods. You are going to be playing your golf game. If that means shooting 100 and picking balls out of the lake in real life, that's what you'll do in the game. At least your feet will keep dry. There are three difficulty levels that alter how forgiving the Gametrak is. On amateur, you'll sink long putts and only grievous hooks and slices will soar out of bounds. Amateur is a good learning tool. After a while, you'll continually trigger the ~Perfect Swing~ animation, and you'll want to bump up the difficulty. Pro is downright hard unless, of course, you are a pro. The variable difficulty levels really add a lot to the replay value as your skills as a golfer increase.    There are 10 unlicensed courses based on real-life European courses, and there's traditional stroke and match play as well as a number of tournaments you can enter. There's also a driving range, putting green and a chipping green where you work on approach shots, as well as a number of forgettable party games. There is no online play and that's a shame since this game was meant to be played online. Imagine a foursome with your buddies on a rainy day or a real-time tournament with a shotgun start. Sadly, we'll have to wait for a sequel for online play.   The crazy contraption makes it all possible. Four player multiplayer is included. Basically, you create four different profiles and each player calibrates his personal swing. Instead of switching off every stroke, each player goes through the entire hole before taking off the gloves and handing them over to the next person -- a good idea that really speeds up the game. I played with a bunch of friends over a few beers while we heckled each other in the middle of our backswings. In short, it was just like a real round, and it was fun.   Visually, RWG is not what anyone would call eye-candy. The textures are a bit rough and pixilated, but none of this takes away from the gameplay experience. The sound is also mediocre with basic swing effects, crowd cheers and ambient noises and a soundtrack you could find in the elevator of your local mall. The announcer is more of a caddy than a broadcaster, giving you personal feedback rather than TV-style coverage.        Real World Golf is not a golf videogame; it's a simulator. Yes, it retails for a hefty $69.99, which includes both the game and the Gametrak controller. Still, that's little more than the cost of the new Tiger game, comparable to the price of a green fee at a good course, and cheaper than a lesson with a golf-pro. You get feedback after every swing. No, the graphics and sound are nothing special but graphics and sound do not a game make. On a rainy day when the muni-course is closed, Real World Golf is an affordable and fun golf experience by yourself or with your golfing buddies. With ten courses and variable difficulty levels, you'll have hours of golfing ahead of you and your shoes will never get dirty. Yes, you may snap your putter in two after a bad putt, but that's golf. That's Real World Golf.", "date": "Apr 10, 2006"}
