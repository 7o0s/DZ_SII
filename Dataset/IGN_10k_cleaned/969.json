You wrote your congressman asking him to sign the bill so that it might be so. And now, just five years late of its motion picture counterpart, Capser the Friendly Ghost is on the Game Boy Color!   Features Based on the cartoon favorite and hit motion picture Morph into one of more than four different ghostal manifestations Face Casper's nefarious uncles Stretch, Stinkie, and Fatso Only for Game Boy Color    I could jest forever about the existence of this game so far outside of 1995's Caspermania or even the cartoon resurgence days when Capser was a phenomenon, way back when 70's girls wore Beefy-Ts with the red collar and sleeve trim while they stood in line for Jaws tickets (I watch a lot of the E! channel). The fact remains, however, that plenty of much more stupid licenses and nancy-boy patsy heroes have netted their own videogame, and they've been done much worse than this amiable Interplay creation.  For one, any game that doesn't have the lead hero strutting from left to right and disposing of foes by bouncing on their heads with his butt deserves credit. Casper isn't exactly an original game, but it does make good use of the license in a clever, nonviolent puzzle challenge.  The problem, of course, is than a nonviolent puzzler can be as dull as slick snot, and combining that with a nonlinear quest that just lets the player roam around the playfield for hours on end without doing anything fun, completely lost and without a clue for where to go next... That's murder on the attention span, and this game is unfortunately that and much more.  Casper roams around the mansion setting of the movie, hiding from the unhappy haunts made of his uncles. Early on, two new humans move into the house, and as Casper falls for the daughter Kat (the Christina Ricci role in the film), players will guide the Friendly Ghost as he tries to woo his living love. Collect roses, perfumes, and other objects for the object of your affection, all the while battling your wicked uncles for pieces of a machine that might just unite Casper and his love in an earthly embrace.  It's a swell idea, and the game works well for the first twenty minutes or so. But the mansion maze that Casper must solve is so convoluted and without landmarks that getting through any more is terribly confusing and difficult. The game isn't too tough for its young target audience, but it will surely test their patience and frustration level. For instance, Casper morphs into different forms to get through challenges -- a puff of smoke to ride vents, a saw blade to cut through barricades -- but using each form takes off of Casper's life, meaning that just generally exploring and solving a puzzle with your mind works against you. Casper gets killed just for playing his game!  Its just little things like that, combined with a grueling game layout that's wholly illogical, that kills this game. The map is complete trash, so getting around will be a test of memory for the thousands of vents, switches, and obstacles players will have to traverse. The graphics aren't much kinder, as the look of each floor is just barely different from the last. Also kicking the graphic engine is the loadtime on the hint screen that pops up every time Casper picks up an item -- when a floor is full or coins, it may take minutes to collect them all. And all the while, you'll be lost in this huge abode with a single music track to brighten your play. Yes, it's a very well done song, but there's only one!     Casper is a well-conceived game that just can't get out of its own mire. Puzzle maze challenges need some variety, some exciting events, some graphic touches, and some new challenges to entice gamers, and Casper unfortunately has little of that. Even battles with bosses are dull and remote. This is the mirror image of Casper -- you know the ghost there, but you can't see or touch it.", "date": "May 31, 2000"}
