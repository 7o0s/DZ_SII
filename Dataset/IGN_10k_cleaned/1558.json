It seems like there's no end in sight to the tsunami of great games we're being offered, many of them from Square.    But what about the other companies, the ones that tend to make games like we remember them from back in the old days?  Capcom's Breath of Fire IV is just around the bend, and Working Designs' re-release of Lunar 2:  Eternal Blue Complete is finally here. Lunar 2 isn't all about characters who're anti-social and generally difficult to deal with, like Cloud Strife and Squall Lionheart of Final Fantasy fame.  In fact, the plot is about as basic as you could get.  Throw in a goddess, dump in a villain, toss in a handful of main characters, and that's your game.  There's nothing brutally deep like Cloud attempting to discover who he is in relation to Sephiroth.  It's just plain simple, and that's the fun of it.   Love it or hate it, the Lunar series is different from today's mind-numbingly deep RPGs.  Simplicity is a key element in Lunar's charm. Whereas the villain is your typical bastard who will stop at nothing to have his way with the world, and the story has minor, if not predictable plot twists, the game just shines as a token of our past.  Back in the days of Super NES and Sega CD, gamers didn't need plots that would shake and stir them. They just needed an excuse to have a good time. Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete gives you the perfect opportunity to revisit your old selves and admit that games with terribly outdated graphics can prove to be just as entertaining as our modern gems.   Gameplay Unless you're one of the few hardcore gamers who picked up a Sega CD years ago, or a die-hard Sega fan who went out on a limb to purchase one, this game is completely new to you.  Those of you familiar with Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete, which was re-released on PlayStation last year,  will find several similarities between that and this. For instance, unlike the Final Fantasy series, the plots mesh together somewhat.  There are subtle allusions here and there to 1,000 years ago, when the first Lunar took place.   As you may have guessed, a lot can happen within a millennium. For one, Alex is long gone.  The main character of this Lunar is named Hiro, who is accompanied by Ruby, a flying cat who claims to be a red dragon.  The game opens with a very long introduction, which is intricately detailed and leaves many mysteries in its wake.  After the video scene comes to a close, Hiro is shown in a dungeon, trying to break loose a gem from a stone dragon's eye socket.  As he works, a trap goes off, and he hurries to finish.  Directly after he collects the jewel, his rope breaks, thus sending Hiro and Ruby plummeting to the ground far below.  When he regains consciousness, he flees the dungeon and hurries to his grandfather's (Gwyn's) house, where he learns about the ~Destroyer,~ who is rumored to appear at the nearby Blue Spire.  Hiro and Gwyn are just in time to witness a peculiar beam of light strike the Blue Spire.  Thinking this to be the arrival of the Destroyer, they enter the tower and explore until they reach its highest floor.  Hiro accidentally is swept off by magic to a special place where Lucia, a young female from the Blue Star, appears from a crystal and asks for his help. Could this be the Destroyer?  She seems so innocent and beautiful; surely this creature could be nothing but sweetness.  However, she insists that she must find the goddess, Althena, and that the fate of the planet depends upon it.  Thus begins the journey, and a long one at that.   As its graphics may suggest, Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete is pretty basic, as far as battles and menus are concerned.  Fights are turn-based, but there are a couple twists that you won't find in the Final Fantasy serieis.  Instead of being able to select the ~attack~ command and then choosing which foe you want to hit, you have to judge distance and think a little more carefully.  When you or your party members attack, they first have to move close to the enemy you've chosen.  If Gwyn, for example, is far away from an enemy, chances are that he won't be able to do any damage this round.  Hiro, on the other hand, has a long moving range, and can attack most enemies on the field.  Another difference in battling is that some characters can attack multiple times per round.  Hiro is able to attack twice at the beginning of the game, if he has a light weapon, such as a dagger equipped.  Equipping something like a short sword, however, will reduce his number of attacks per round.   Finally, the magic system is just like I remember it from my early gaming days.  Instead of having to buy and equip magic kinds, you earn them by gaining levels.  That was one of the factors which made building up your levels worthwhile.  Sure, it's nice to gain more hit points and power, but it was always the magic spells that drove me to sit down for hours and make my characters stronger.   Like Earthbound, Chrono Trigger, or much of Lufia 2: Rise of the Sinistrals, battles are not randomly chosen.  There are sprites on screen, which depict the type of monsters you'll have to fight, should you be so unlucky to run into a confrontation. Unlike most other RPGs, it seems like you are unable to be attacked from behind or get a pre-emptive chance to strike. One thing that can be both a blessing and a curse in Lunar 2 is its 'memory.' When in battle, the game remembers the last action to took, and will immediately select that choice for you the next time you have an attack. For instance, if Hiro casts ~Poe Sword~ one round, that spell will automatically be selected the next one.   Graphics Although the 16-bit years are completely over, the past is back for another go-around.  This being a port of one of Sega CD's finest games, little can be expected in visual improvements.  The amount of colors used is increased and the animations are better to an extent, but when compared to the beauty of today's RPGs, this is the black sheep of the PlayStation family.  The animation looks like it's missing some frames in a few instances.  Take the walking animations, for examples. They just look wonky.  Everything looks fine when you're moving up and down, but the feet don't match up when walking from side to side.   Some of you may complain about this next part.  I've heard your whines and whimpers about modern Final Fantasy games, trust me.  ~Games are meant to be played, not watched.~  Cry me a river.  The Lunar series is so enjoyable because it's like playing an anime.  One second you're exploring a dungeon, and then the next you're watching an awesome mesh of computer graphics and hand-drawn art.  Although Square may be notorious for making some of the best cutscenes ever seen in videogames, Lunar 2 is refreshingly different, and yet on a level of its own.  The blend of CG with 2D animation mixes flawlessly and is very captivating, especially in key sequences when the story unfolds. The reason that Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete spans three disks is because there is a lot of video to watch. If for some reason you're uninterested in watching it, you can skip it and move on.   Sound The music and sound effects are a big plus for Lunar 2. The music, whether in a dungeon, battle, or village, is moody and well composed.  I wouldn't be stretching the truth if I said that this was some of the best music I've heard in a role-playing game.  The sound effects and voice acting, during cutscenes especially, is cinema-quality.  On occasion, characters will speak with actual words during dialogues, but it's impossible to tell exactly when someone will have something to say. When they do talk, their voices are crystal-clear and acted professionally.  This is exactly what the PlayStation needs.  The problem with many RPGs these days is that they take themselves way too seriously.  Why does the world have to seem like such a dark place in so many games?  Lunar 2 has a reversed mentality from exactly that.  Instead of hiding behind a cloak of seriousness, it extracts qualities from simple themes that redeem it as a charming, fun game. So what if it was made years ago and it looks like crap now?  It has many incentives for you to pick it up.  In addition to the long, entertaining game, you get a music CD and a ~Making of Lunar 2~ CD.  The game, itself, should be reason enough to run out and buy, buy, buy.", "date": "Nov 30, 2000"}
