Dark Fall: The Journal, definitely does this.  Although its not the most technologically advanced of games, it has a gripping story coupled with subtle nuances that add a dimension of fear to the experience.  Add in some puzzles and a lot of investigating and what you have is a pretty decent game.   The story begins with a phone call from your brother.  He is an architect who is working on a project on an old train station.  He asks you to come to the station to meet him, as he needs help.  He also sounds a little afraid.  So, out you go to the station and you arrive to find it completely abandoned.  Or is it?  A small child's voice greets you and gives you an introduction to Dowerton Station.  He turns out to be 11 year old Timothy Pike who disappeared years before and he tells you that your brother is with them and they need help.   As you explore the train station and later, the hotel attached to the station, you will uncover details on several mysterious disappearances throughout the years all leading back to the release of an unspeakable evil decades ago.  Through reading newspaper clippings, journals and uncovering hidden clues, the truth will be revealed.   The story itself is intriguing and you will definitely want to finish this game to discover the answers.  Little nuances in Dark Fall add an element of suspense and even fear at times.  This is a game where you may want to explore its rooms when the sun is high, or at least with the lights fully on.  Often, when you enter a new location, you'll hear a ghostly voice or see an unexplainable, but brief, event.  For example, in one bathroom, when you back away from the toilet, a shadow of a man flashes in the dark briefly.  The way the developers incorporate these types of events is very well done and gives the game an overall edge of your seat feeling.   The puzzles are understandable, although pretty complex at times.  There are even cryptograms that if you discover the codes and decipher them, will help you solve the game.  The end of the game is entirely puzzles, which you will be able to solve if you have discovered all the clues - and there are a ton of them - that the developers have put into the story.     The game employs a simple point and click interface.  If something can be stored in your inventory and later used, it will automatically go there.  Very few items will be needed though.  The majority of the game will be spent collecting tidbits of information, which you will need to write down.  The one thing it is missing is an in-game journal you can use to log clues and important pieces of the overall puzzle.  Save and load is done simply and the game can be saved at any time.   The graphics are simply done, but suitable for the game.  The artwork is detailed and very dark.  You can tell something is definitely amiss just from the first glance.   There aren't really any cutscenes, but where animations exist, they enhance the gameplay.  The sounds are very well done, with whispers that put a little fear in your heart and single notes that make you wonder when something is going to jump out at you.This is not an overly complex or time consuming adventure game.  It is a simply done ghost story, but there is something to be said for simple.  The focus is on collecting information and discovering the truth behind these disappearances.  If there is one thing the game is lacking, besides a journal, it's that you never truly care about the characters.  Despite that, you will care about the story and that will drive you through to the end.  It is a very enjoyable point and click adventure and I would suggest anyone who likes a good spook tale or a fairly well put together game definitely check this one out.", "date": "Aug 20, 2003"}
