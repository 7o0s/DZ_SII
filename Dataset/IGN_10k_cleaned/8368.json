Partnering with EA for the publisher's first Xbox Live Arcade game, Bizarre gives us a happy little fireworks show with an addictive twist in Boom Boom Rocket.   Using the Simon Says concept behind Parappa the Rapper and Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) as its central design, Bizarre takes a game that sounds like a Japanese title (Chu Chu Rocket, anyone?), that looks reminiscent of the PS2 tech demo/game, Fantavision, and is technically playable with your Guitar Hero 2 360 guitar, and manufactures something somehow original and yet not at all original. The final product is good but not great, likeable but not loveable, somewhat but not terribly addictive, and doesn't drive home that memorable soundtrack to keep you around for weeks. Boom Boom Rocket is worth your while, but not too much of your while.    A music rhythm game designed with the Xbox 360 controller in mind rather than a dance pad or guitar, Boom Boom Rocket (BBR) plays like DDR and Fantavision fused together. Or looking at it another way, BBR is a musical take on Geometry Wars. Multi-colored fireworks shoot up from the ground into an anonymous city at nighttime topped with a horizontal bar. Your job is to time button presses when the fireworks cross the line to earn the highest points possible. When you time it right, the rockets explode into bright colorful 3D fireworks. Miss the bar and the rocket fizzles out.  Miss too many and the game quickly ends. BBR rates your performance on timing, hit and miss ratios, consistency and bonuses, providing descriptors and different points for each firework that's timed right (OK, good, awesome, perfect, etc.). The fun part comes when you finally memorize the location of each face button and can start playing the game at higher speeds, getting into a rhythm and feeling the music tie into the game design.    BBR offers an acceptable level of modes. It offers a 10-track single-player campaign, an endurance mode, a two-player vertical split-screen and online versus mode (which is hairy and tough and really fun all in one big messy ball), leaderboards, a quick help menu and the option to download new stuff. Hopefully the new downloadable stuff equates to more and preferably licensed tracks. But as of now, there is nothing to download.    As the game progresses in each difficulty mode, the songs grow more complex and challenging. For instance, the normally straight-shooting fireworks change speeds in mid-stream, starting off slowly and then speeding up at the crossing bar -- or vice versa. Sometimes they wiggle like little pollywogs as they make their way to the top. They also arc across the sky at different and low angles in slow trajectories while others simultaneously jet across the sky straight up the screen to force you into tough situations. BBR gets pretty wild in the higher levels, and in many ways the simple yet addictive quality of Geometry Wars can be seen influencing this game design.    Part of the problem, however, is the lack of great songs and the simplicity of the song design. These tunes are decent takes on familiar songs, but they don't grab you the way songs in Guitar Hero do. The addictive quality inherent in BBR quickly rubs off, then, because as a music game it's short on the quality and quantity of songs. For instance, Guitar Hero provides an excellent set of mechanics and the kick-ass peripheral and memorable songs. Geometry Wars was a shooter that absolutely demanded your attention. The random and complex ways in which the enemy AI behaved in Geometry Wars was riveting, whereas in BBR, the fireworks are timed to the music so that you're often ~playing~ the game like an instrument. While this is where the game ultimately succeeds, unfortunately the fireworks design is the same for each song, which plays the same each time. With better songs and greater variety of gameplay, BBR feels nice and light, but also like a game that hasn't reached its potential depth or complexity.   BBR has all the good looks and some of the geometrical likeness of Bizarre's other XBLA game, but it's really a big visual fireworks tech demo. By racking up points the bonus meter (top left) gives players a quick multiplier, which amplifies the visual effects, too. The fireworks grow bigger, broader, and wilder. As you beat new levels, you'll earn new visual icons, too, which then appear randomly. Unfortunately, the game's backgrounds -- a city or cities at night -- are completely generic. They're supposed to be good backdrops to the main show, the fireworks, and you hardly see them while you're playing, but their generic presence is still made quite obvious.    There are few options in BBR. The game offers three levels of difficulty, and three visual options for the fireworks themselves. You'll need the various difficulty levels because there is no real middle ground. You'll want to start off in easy mode. Upgrading to the medium level difficulty is a big leap, and with this move, it's become quite clear again to us that Bizarre likes its games tough. Medium difficulty here is pretty hard. I always play games on medium, whether it's music or racing games, and BBR delivers a tough-ass medium level that will make you work -- perhaps too hard. The hard level is just plain ridiculous.    One way to handle the harder difficulty levels is to use both the face buttons and the d-pad in conjunction with one another. While you can't customize the button configuration (which would have been really helpful), you can change the visual representation of the fireworks icon from plain to colored letters to arrows. Mastering double button presses is another way to go. If you try to hook up a Guitar Hero guitar, it technically works, enabling the frets to be used. But the lack of trigger equivalents on the guitar prevent bonuses to be enacted and the rigid button configuration prevent further prevents it. Oh well.   In the end, BBR is a neat semi-original endeavor that's a worthy addition to the empty musical annals of XBLA. It's ultimately a pretty shallow endeavor, but it's still worthy of your time, even if it's overpriced at $10. I know that sounds cheap, but honestly, we're not talking about Castlevania here. We're talking 10 songs. If there are only 10 songs here and there is the potential for more songs, will EA charge us for them? I cringe to think about it.", "date": "Apr 12, 2007"}
