Let's face it, the number of movie sequels that actually approached the quality of their predecessors is fleetingly small compared to the amount of uninspired cash cows that don't quite understand what the originals were about. In the world of games, however, sequels may lack the same sense of novelty and originality than the predecessors, but they almost always carry with them major improvements in previous key problem areas, new features, and most of the time, a more balanced gameplay experience. Other games follow the ~why fix it if it ain't broke~ mantra and simply offer more of the same, changing the level graphics and adding a few weapons, cars, tracks, what have you. Finally, there are those rare misfits that add a ~2~ to the title, but just aren't worthy to be carrying the same name as the forerunner.Unfortunately, Extreme-G 2 seems to be stuck somewhere in the middle. Developed in the UK by Probe and licensed by Storm and Diesel, Extreme-G 2 has better graphics, better sound, more tracks and a large selection of sleek cyber bikes -- but when you add everything up, XG2 is not a better game than the first one. As a matter of fact, thanks to over-ambitious track design and the addition of more lighting effects the N64 can handle, Extreme-G 2 teeters somewhere between insanely fast and fun -- and almost unplayable.GameplayFor those who haven't played Extreme-G, up to four players take control of futuristic, magnetic bikes and race against one another on a variety of planets. While racing is at the heart of the game, there are so many weapons and power-ups that shooting and destruction also become a major part of the gameplay experience.Let's first talk about the good stuff: Control has been greatly improved. The bikes handle better and you don't smash into tracksides as much. Fogging has been reduced to give a deeper viewing distance. There are 12 different tracks, each with 3 variations. Wider tracks make for better navigation and better races. New weapons, like Rear-Fire Rockets and rail guns. Improved camera (switch with D-Pad) Characters. Four-player head-to-head mode. Ghost racers Improved Battle Mode with slow-moving tanks. Multiplayer Cup (up to 16 players compete in two-player split-screen competitions). Contest mode with three cups, three difficulties, plus an added Duel Challenge. Time Trial Mode Practice Arcade Mode (shoot targets)Probe really invested a lot of time to add plenty of features, improve the Battle Mode, and up the top-speed of bikes to Wipeout proportions. You can even break the sound barrier and hear a sonic boom that then drowns out all other audio until you slow down below Mach 1. Everything looks to be bigger and better. Sounds good so far, right? So why do we sound disappointed with this sequel? We believe that there are two all-important factors in a fast-paced action racer that can make or break the game: control and speed. While XG2 theoretically pumps out speeds in excess of Mach 1, the framerate is often so choppy that the sense of speed the game is trying to accomplish is almost completely lost. In turn, control -- which is generally improved over the first game -- becomes guessing work when the screen stutter makes it impossible to judge your bike's exact position. While the Time Trials mode offers a relatively smooth experience, the heart of the game, the Contest (GP) Mode frequently slows down to a crawl when the other computer drivers are on screen. To make things worse, how much fun is it to blow someone up when the explosion causes such slowdown that you lose control of your bike? We would have gladly accepted some pop-up and less lighting and alpha-channeling effects for a more steady framerate.It's almost ironic that XG2 is exactly the opposite of F-Zero X. Lots of track detail, chicanes, moving sky textures, lens-flares on every lightsource, real-time lighting effects, detailed bike models, motion trails, big explosions, multiple audio sources... But it just comes to the point where even launching a mine slows down the action on screen, despite the fact that all other AI drivers are behind you.Like the original, XG2 also has a slew of multiplayer modes, but the inability to see where you're going on the smaller screens and the often much too low framerate put a severe damper on the gameplay fun. The new and improved Battle Mode featuring tanks is a lot better than last year's incarnation, and it speaks for Probe that it put an effort into improving it. Unfortunately, even the tank battles aren't as good as they should be. The floaty controls make it hard to aim and the arrows/radar system is confusing.It's sad that a racer designed to deliver high speeds and intense weapons-based competition is best when playing alone or with the weapons switched off. Last year, Extreme-G ruled supreme as the fastest racer on N64 without any competition and although the idea behind the game was derivative, it excelled at delivering a feel and style of its own. This year, Extreme-G 2 has to compete with F-Zero X and Wipeout 64 -- and it scores significantly lower in our test. Even with all its cool features, tons of tracks and graphics effects, it just can't keep up. That said, XG2 is definitely worth a rental and will make a decent buy for racing fans looking for a little variety.GraphicsThe 12 lavishly decorated tracks and newly-designed vehicles beat both Wipeout's and F-Zero X's, and the new animated menu system is so well conceived artistically, it's easy to get stuck just messing around with the different options. Every element is presented on colorful disk menus that can be rotated and zoomed in and out and even the volume options and name entry screens are in the shape of dials. If you lose a race, you will be treated to an animation of your character kicking his/her bike off a disk-shaped platform, which then becomes unbalanced and throws the loser off as well. The menu designers really deserve a raise.The overall graphics are improved with better textures and more visibility, but there still is a fair share of fogging and the game is as blurry as the original (do we really need filtering on such a fast game?). The bikes are much more detailed, with a better feel for suspension, and the exotic tracks range from dirt tracks in an alien forest to a glass tunnel going over a maze of futuristic roadways. Not only will you see wildlife such as birds and giant dragonflies, but Probe also uses tons of realtime lighting effects to douse the tracks with colored light. Some of the courses are designed for maximum speed (to showcase the super-bikes), and there are a few excellent track elements. That last track, however, is a little too cheap. What starts off with an innovative cul-de-sac that sends you racing into the opposite direction finally ends up to be a frustrating right-left of zig-zag turns that just aren't fun. The weapons effects and explosions are also much improved, but it's just too much for the engine. Because of all the effects, there are only very few instances in the game when the framerate is smooth and steady.SoundInstead of going for even louder techno, XG2 features Phillip Glass inspired tunes that stay in the background most of the time. The sound effects are excellent. Each bike now has a different engine sound, the turbo and sonic boom effects reverberate with a lasting thunder, dynamic audio sources swoosh by (such as water or ringing bells), and Probe even included Doppler effects to increase the sense of speed. A French chick announces what weapons you pick up. Good sound design.It's evident that Probe put a lot of work into making Extreme-G 2 a good game. Unfortunately, with all the glitz and fancy lighting, the developers seem to have forgotten that all that means nothing if it screws up the gameplay. A racing game that's all about speed can't afford to be bogged down to an extent where the low framerate jeopardizes the control and ability to judge the track ahead of you -- especially when your bike has a habit of flipping around when hitting banked track barriers. If Acclaim is already planning a sequel for next year, here's hoping that the design process starts with making the Contest Mode more playable. I'll take draw-in, pop-up, or letterboxing over screen stutter anytime. Definitely rent XG2 first before buying. If you can live with the problems, then the wealth of tracks and modes could make it a recommended buy for you.", "date": "Nov 18, 1998"}
