When the system launched in late 2004, Activision and Vicarious Visions were right there from the start with a traditional action design that seemed to focus more on the 3D aspects of the Nintendo DS than its touch-screen. But when Ultimate Spider-Man hit the portable several months later, the developer pushed more ambitious stylus control for nearly half the product. Spider-Man 3 is the third Spidey DS game from Vicarious Visions (last year's Spider-Man: Battle for New York was a Torus production), and the team went all-out with a 100% stylus controlled action game. It's a drastic move that might seem a little too out there, but ultimately the move works; controlling Spider-Man using touch-screen swipes and scribbles opens up some unique ideas for traditional gameplay and turns ~yet another Spider-Man game for DS~ into something truly special.   The foundation of Spider-Man 3 is the same core gameplay of Vicarious Visions' previous Spider-Man outings on the Nintendo DS: 3D visuals but 2D action mechanics. The exploration is still ~on rails~ as the levels keep Spider-Man on a strict side-scrolling path, so it's ultimately a much more restrictive experience than the open-world designs produced on the consoles. Its restrictiveness isn't a negative, and in many respects, keeping Spider-Man in a side-scrolling environment removes a lot of gameplay wonkiness that 3D Spider-Man games have yet to shake.    What makes Spider-Man 3 much different than its DS predecessors -- and, let's face it, other games on the Nintendo DS -- is its all-stylus control for combat and special moves. In Ultimate Spider-Man you swapped the stylus in and out as the game jumped from Spider-Man to Venom. But in Spider-Man 3, the stylus will be in your hand 100%. Running left to right, jumping and ducking, and, of course, webswinging through the environments are handled by the D-pad. Punches, kicks and web attacks are handled by taps and swipes on the touch-screen -- a swipe towards the character executes a punch, or a swipe angled downwards will sweep the leg. Double tapping the touch screen in a specific location will shoot webbing in that direction. Lefties and righties are on equal footing in this game since the D-pad controls are mapped to the A, B, X, and Y action buttons.   All this may sound awkward and disconnecting, especially since the upper screen's displaying what you're doing on the lower screen. And like anything new it can certainly be that way from the start of the experience...but five minutes after the initial learning curve and you'll be pulling off some spectacular combinations. It's easy, intuitive and incredibly satisfying to, say, knock an enemy down with a tripping foot-sweep, uppercut his fallen body into the air, leap up after him to throw his arching body back down to the pavement below, only to wrap him up in webbing to swing him over your head and use him as a projectile against any bad guys in the distance...all the while a combo counter nestles subtly on the side of the screen keeping track of how many successive hits you've managed to get in.      This combo system isn't perfect, and there will be times when what you've swiped on-screen isn't what Spidey performs. The enemy animation and collision detection isn't handled as tightly as it could have been, too. The designers try to encourage players to mix up the moves instead of simply scribbling by having certain enemies immune to specific attacks, but the lack of feedback or old-school exaggerated motions make it difficult to ~feel~ when an enemy's blocking or when your character's taking hits. After a few times through the levels you'll get it, but it definitely takes a bit of practice (and patience) to understand why an uppercut didn't connect. But it's a good start to a clever new way of playing Double Dragon-style brawlers -- imagining these controls and combo system attached to TMNT GBA's collision engine makes us salivate.      Spider-Man 3 follows the basic outline of the film for its level progression -- New Goblin, Sandman, and Venom are all within the mission structure, but much of the levels follow a character named Dewolfe as she sends Spider-Man into the criminal underworld. The ~black suit~ isn't a huge focus in the gameplay as it is in the console version -- in the DS version, it's just a special power that's automatically activated as Spider-Man punches and kicks through a level. There's no penalty in using it, and in fact its upgraded powers make hammering down on enemies a lot easier to do. The designers did have fun with some of Black Suit Spidey's animations, too -- some of the finishing moves are quite cool to watch.   Like Vicarious Visions previous DS games like Ultimate Spider-Man and Tony Hawk, Spider-Man 3 uses the team's limited animation, voiced-over cutscene engine to drive the story. But in this case, the team went for a ~newspaper~ visual style. Its muted and undersaturated look might've seemed like a good idea at the time, but the lack of color comes off not anywhere near as impressive and fun as the rest of the game's feel.   But other than the bland cutscenes, this game looks fantastic. Previous Spider-Man games on the DS have had great visuals. This, too has evolved in Spider-Man 3. Though the framerate had to be brought down from the peppy and smooth 60 frames per second to a much more stable 30, the compromise was worth it -- environments are absolutely massive this time around, texture work is a lot more detailed, and the camera system is a lot more dynamic to give players a greater scope of Spidey's surroundings.      One of our complaints in the team's Ultimate Spider-Man production has been addressed in Spider-Man 3: more replay value. Even though this game can be completed from start to finish in just under five hours, there's still plenty of challenge within. Players can complete ~Crime Watches,~ essentially cleaning out each territory of bad guys. They can also take part in viciously difficult ~races,~ where players must webswing through each level grabbing floating orbs with very few seconds to do it. There are tons of unlockables, including some pretty cool special moves, which can be purchased with ~money~ earned completing challenges. There are even some hidden tokens to collect. And once a mission's completed, an ~Ultimate Challenge~ is unlocked for players to complete in the shortest amount of time. There's also a series of wireless multiplayer challenges, but we only had one copy of the game at the time of review so we couldn't test this feature. So, you can certainly see the end of the story in a day, but there's still a good amount of play in Spider-Man 3.It's pretty clear that Vicarious Visions needed to do something truly unique for the Spider-Man franchise on the DS -- it's a little hard to expect a user base to blindly snag yet another Spider-Man game after three have already been released in just two years time. It was a risk to make an all-stylus action game in a design that's usually been a more traditional-controlling experience, but the team pretty much nailed it. The combat system's collision could be tighter and just a little more ~fluid,~ but it's a hell of a lot of fun kicking bad guys' butts with quick flicks of the wrist. Stylus combat works. If anything, this touch screen focus could spawn a new wave of brawler design, and I can't wait to see how this control system evolves in future DS games.", "date": "May 4, 2007"}
