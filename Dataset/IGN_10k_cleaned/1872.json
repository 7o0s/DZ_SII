SpongeBob SquarePants, Nickelodeon's hit cartoon series, has finally come to the Game Boy Color in a platformer that's enjoyable for kids and captures the show's off-center humor. Parents be warned, though: if you pick this one up, you may be required to help your child navigate its awkward menus and occasionally muddled level design. Developed by Vicarious Visions, SpongeBob SquarePants: Legend of the Lost Spatula is a significant improvement from the company's earlier Nickelodeon titles like Rugrats in Paris. It may not win any awards, but Legend of the Lost Spatula has enough to satisfy young fans of the series. Features 11 areas with 4 bosses 6 utility belt items plus other bonus items Password save  Only for Game Boy Color  SpongeBob's quest begins when he finds a statue that marks the entrance to the Flying Dutchman's Underworld, a lost land where a legendary fry cook once ruled. If SpongeBob can collect the missing pieces of the statue, he'll be able to unlock the Underworld and obtain the Golden Spatula that lies within. With it, SpongeBob can become the greatest fry cook ever!  Legend of the Lost Spatula is a straightforward platformer that most young kids should enjoy. Plenty of running, jumping, falling and swimming for SpongeBob to do, and the creative use of items really adds to the gameplay. As SpongeBob explores the ocean floor, he collects various item/weapons that can be used on enemies, including a Jellyfish Net to capture smaller bad guys like scallops and urchins. But SpongeBob also picks up a Spatula which can be used to temporarily neutralize your enemies by stuffing their faces with delicious burgers. For larger bosses, SpongeBob has to combine his items to bring his enemies to their knees. SpongeBob's 'damage' is measured (amusingly enough) by the seat of his pants; as enemies strike him he loses a pair of his pants, eventually getting stripped down to his undies before becoming so embarrassed that players are forced to restart the section of the game. For the most part its a fun romp through the wacky world of SpongeBob and his friends that's well suited for its young audience.   Unfortunately, Legend of the Lost Spatula has its problems, too. To begin with, the game uses passwords, which can prove frustrating for younger and older players alike. Add to that the fact that the game's save points are few, far-between, and unmarked. The levels themselves can often be confusing, with unclear designs that lead to a lot of backtracking. Another major frustration involves the item/weapon system. Switching between items to defeat enemies and solve puzzles is an integral part of the gameplay; but THQ has buried the item-swapping screen in its multiple menus, making for tedious and repetitive trips through the menus. A game so clearly aimed at younger players should have found a simpler method to change items.  Although THQ has used a muted, washed-out visual style that can sometimes strain your eyes, the main characters of the game are expressive and amusing. All of SpongeBob's friends like Patrick Star, Squidward Tentacles, and Mr. Krabs make appearances, and SpongeBob himself squishes and contorts himself into comical shapes throughout the game. The opening sequence of still cartoons that set the story up bring you right into the cartoon, and more sequences like this later in the game might have helped move the story along. Although SpongeBob SquarePants: Legend of the Lost Spatula has its problems, its a decent platformer that young fans will enjoy. Older players will want to skip this one, but the large levels, multiple objectives, and amusing characters make this worth buying if you've got a child that really loves SpongeBob.", "date": "Mar 31, 2001"}
