Using the touch screen, players directed Phoneix's courtroom behavior, submitted evidence, and called out a screen-filling ~Objection!~ when they had the inkling that something was as rotten as five-day-old fish. It was good, goofy fun -- and now a new audience has a chance to discover the charms of Capcom's ~ace attorney.~   But how does a Nintendo DS (and Game Boy Advance in Japan) game make a successful move to mobile? The platforms have very different feature sets, such as only one screen or no touch functionality. Can the game make it on quirk and charm?   Phoenix Wright really fudges the rules of being a lawyer. Not only is the general protocol of a court completely unlike most Western courtrooms, but you dabble in detective work and CSI-style forensics. Arguably blurring these features together makes the game eminently more playable, but it's important to note for any gamer that thinks they are about download a true blue legal sim. (Which could be quite interesting in its own Wright... er, right.)   Cases take some time to work. Between court scenes, you must pay attention to story sequences, such as meeting new characters or dealing with the fallout of your courtroom antics. These sequences are not short. The give-and-take in the courtroom is also pretty lengthy, and with a definite amount of scripted plot points, you'll invest some serious time in this game. This is the one area where I have to wonder about the fate of Phoenix on mobile. Gamers used to jumping into to a cell game for a five-minute burst of fun won't get a quick payoff from Phoenix. Cases can take around 30-40 minutes or so to complete, and there are no easy points of entry or exit when you need to get back to work or school.   I really don't want to spoil any of the twists and turns of the cases here -- that's not fair to gamers eager to try Phoenix out for themselves -- but I'll use the general flow of the first case as an example of the game works. You meet your buddy Mr. Butz, who has been accused of murdering a young woman he harbored quite a crush on. During the case, it will appear you are about to score an easy win, then things look sour, then you discover new evidence, and then a witness' testimony charges (yet without any talk of perjury!). You finish things up with a few new discoveries (that a detective or CSI would look for, not a lawyer) that backs the suspect into a corner.   Gameloft's Special Crimes Unit (which was seemingly inspired by Phoneix) tackled this issue by building the game in easily digestible blocks. You could work part of a case -- complete with set-up, task, and information discovery -- within just three or four minutes. However, SCU was also quite a bit shorter than Phoenix. There are several cases in here you can download. (Note: Phoenix Wright accesses the network, so keep that in mind and consider your data plan.)   For just a moment, though, let's set aside the question of whether a lengthy, dialogue-driven game like Phoenix Wright is appropriate for mobile and discuss it on game play merits alone. If you have played the original game on the Nintendo DS (a sequel was recently launched), you know how well it worked. It felt fresh and unique in the gaming landscape. The writing was silly (but clever) and it was fun to unravel the case and correctly point out the perpetrators of the crimes. And Phoenix retains all of this in its mobile incarnation; save for the touch screen functionality, this is a pretty spot-on facsimile.    And what of losing touch screen functionality? You now just choose dialogue from a menu instead of touching it. Manipulating case files and looking at evidence is now handled via the softkeys. There is no significant impact on game play.   I tested the game on a RAZR this week. The larger screen shows off the game's excellent art work. The copious amounts of text are easy to read. Navigating menus is also quite easy and intuitive. The game also includes quite a bit of audio -- all of it sounds good.  Phoenix Wright is definitely not a game for everybody. Some people will find the dialogue scenes interminably long; even if they can save and rejoin later, the flow of the plot is not made for this kind of in-and-out player. However, if you are looking for something decidedly different and appreciate clever writing, Phoenix Wright is a good alternative to puzzle and poker games. It's fun to call ~Objection!~ and see Phoenix tap papers against his hands as he turns the screws on a fibbing witness. There is a lot of game in this download, too, making it an exceptional value. I do wish Capcom had insisted on some mobile-specific features, such as providing easy points to jump out of the game, but as far as DS-to-mobile ports go, this is a solid game. I recommend it to anybody wanting to try something offbeat and new.", "date": "Feb 3, 2007"}
