At least, that's the lesson you'd have to take away from the new Black & White 2 expansion Battle of the Gods. After securing Eden and making everything nice and peaceful (or nice and burning depending on your temperament), you thought you could settle back for your day of rest. Not so. The pesky Aztecs have managed to call forth a new god to challenge your supremacy on the islands of Eden. Now you'll have to face off against him and his undead army.  The original Black & White 2 never really made you feel like you were competing with another deity. In the absence of any sort of rivalry between two opposing gods, victory in the last game was sort of inevitable, no matter how poorly you managed your people. That's not exactly the case in Battle of the Gods. Here you'll find yourself presented with an immediately hostile adversary. To be fair, the challenge still isn't terribly overwhelming but it does provide a little more excitement and personality than was found in the previous game.   For one thing, the evil guy you're up against is a Chatty Kathy. He comments on the fight pretty often throughout the game. Hearing his rumbling, totally evil voice call out to his creature to bring in more villagers to sacrifice definitely helps you get caught up in the action. And when you see his hand roaming around your buildings or tossing rocks at your armies, well, then it's just downright personal.  Still, he's not as formidable an opponent as you might expect. Though having him tossing stuff at you definitely creates a distraction, he seems more content to solidify his own position and let you take over the neutral towns at your leisure. He's no more aggressive in his use of his armies or his creature. Rather than trying to overwhelm you at once, he prefers instead to send out his armies in bits and pieces that are easily destroyed by all but the least attentive players.  But he does have a few new tricks up his sleeve. Since he's got this whole death fetish, his armies are made up of undead warriors. They fight and die just like regular soldiers but their appearance is at least visually unsettling. It's not nearly as unsettling as his own creatures; the undead monkey from the first island is pretty chilling. In any case, the big bad one doesn't present much of a threat to you either in terms of military might or development of impressiveness.  A handful of new buildings add a few more tactical options this time around. A blacksmith can upgrade your soldiers for instance, making them more effective on the battlefield. Hospitals heal damaged units, letting you save the mana you normally spent on healing for other miracles. While the new buildings are nice, none of them really alter the game in any significant way. They merely serve as small supplements to your existing strategies.  I'd like to have seen a little more sophistication in the military side of the game. Sure, you have a few extra spells (one of which even allows you to form your own undead soldiers) but Battle of the Gods is still basically just a numbers game. Get enough troops together, point them in the direction of the enemy and sit back and watch the action. While there's definitely a compelling challenge to creating a good army, leading it into battle is still a little too hands-off for my tastes.  Those players (like me) who don't happen to have their original Black & White 2 saved games need not worry. The new expansion lets old and new players hit the ground running. To begin with, you can select one of two starting packages -- one good and one evil -- that give you a variety of miracles and bonuses to give you a leg up. You can also elect to start off as neutral and fine tune your own starting package. You'll basically be given a ton of tribute to spend how you see fit. Since you get so much tribute to start with, you'll find yourself springing for that lava wonder fairly quickly.      You can also import your existing creatures into the game. If you don't have him anymore, the game lets you pick a brand new creature and start training him right away. Happily, I didn't find that your rival's creatures were so powerful that your brand new creature couldn't hold their own. Shellback lovers out there will be happy to see the new turtle creature in the expansion. Seeing him grow spikes on his back as he takes on a more evil aspect is a real blast.  The interface hasn't changed at all. Not surprisingly, the expansion pack does away with the incredibly long tutorial that we had to suffer through in the core game. Assuming you remember how to control the original game, you'll have no trouble at all jumping right into Black & White 2: Battle of the Gods. Considering everything you have to do, I'm still very impressed that the whole game is mouse driven. The throwing interface is still a little awkward and it can be tough picking up your villagers sometimes but, for the most part, the hand of god is remarkably intuitive and convenient.   There are only a few islands here but they're so much larger than those in Black & White 2 that you'll get at least a few hours of gameplay from each one. (You'll get even more if, like me, you have frequent crashes towards the end of the second island.) I criticized Black & White 2 for not offering more scripted interaction between you and your villagers. The scroll challenges offered here are just as disconnected from the main action as ever. You'll still have the massive variety of goals that you had in the previous game but there's been no attempt to offer the human perspectives we saw in the original Black & White.  Apart from the regular development goals, you'll have the silver scroll minigames. Some are purely based on reactions and reflexes -- there's a Missile Command segment where you have to zap skeletons who are chasing villagers. There are some logic challenges as well, most of which can be solved by simple trial and error. The few that required more creative thinking were much more satisfying but also took up quite a bit more time.  Those of you who were hoping for multiplayer this time around can just keep on hoping. While the new opponent is a bit more active in the expansion, he just doesn't put the pressure on you the way a human player would.For only twenty bucks, the new expansion is a pretty good deal for fans of the original game. It doesn't really add any new toys to play with and the few that it does add are pretty much superfluous. The only real addition worth mentioning (beyond just having more missions) is the inclusion of an enemy with a definite personality and agenda. Sure, the military game is still just about pumping out enough soldiers to overwhelm your enemy, but the fact that the enemy is even there at all gives the expansion a focus that was missing from the original game. The fact that the game started crashing on me towards the end of the second island definitely hampered my enjoyment. It may have been caused by the five or six volcanoes I plopped down around my enemy. Still, this is a god game -- what did they expect?", "date": "Apr 25, 2006"}
