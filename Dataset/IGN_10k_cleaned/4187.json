The port was a perfect one, actually better than the original thanks to additional multiplayer modes not in the original game. But the actual game design, regardless of the fanbase who loved it back in the day, was just so...blah. But the port was successful enough for Capcom to move forth on its own for the sequel, Disney's Magical Quest 2. Again, the conversion from SNES to GBA went smoothly, but the game itself, while tweaked tighter than the original, is extremely bland and easy to beat. This sequel doesn't even have anything extra beyond a two player cooperative mode that requires link cable. It will at least make kids feel like they're accomplishing something, but the better-than-casual gamer crowd need not bother with this one. Features Two playable characters Six worlds Link cable support for two players (multiple cartridge) Cartridge save Magical Quest 2 builds off the game formula created for the original, with players controlling Mickey or Minnie in a traditional, platform-hopping side-scrolling environment. Each of the levels are segmented between platform action and boss battles, with each area featuring two distinct boss challenges to complete. The game's adventure takes players through an overworld of six different locations, and all of these levels can either be played solo or with a friend via link cable...but considering the challenge isn't very high, there's no advantage in having a second person in the action beyond giving someone something to do.  The gameplay hook in Magical Quest 2 is the same as what the original Magical Quest offered: special suits that give Mickey or Minnie special abilities. In Magical Quest 2, there are three different outfits to wear: a vacuum cleaner that can suck up enemies a la Luigi's Mansion, mountain gear that lets the characters climb sides of cliffs or trees and dangle from strategically positioned hooks, and a Cowboy hobby horse that makes pouncing and shooting enemies a piece of cake. These suits are awarded after the first, second, and third levels, but once they're in the inventory they can be swapped at anytime during the game. These suits and their abilities expand on Mickey or Minnie's standard enemy-bouncing buttstomp and throw moves.  Though these outfits offer a lot of gameplay promise, Capcom kept the game design as simple as can be...and it's not really necessary to continuously jump from one outfit to another apart from one or two different and specific spots. In fact, that's the big problem with Magical Quest 2: it's just too darn basic. It puts forth a lot of gameplay elements, but it honestly doesn't really require much to beat...many of the unique elements can be skipped altogether to beat the game. The developers made sure that the game plays more tightly than the original Magical Quest, but now the game is far too easy to finish, with very little incentive to play it again. There are a couple of ~ooh, neat~ factors to watch for, like the maze of rooms that rotate 90 degrees using the Game Boy Advance's hardware...an element that's only been used once or twice before on the handheld. But in Magical Quest 2's case, it's not used for anything but a simple task that requires nothing more than following the path that it lays out.   The one saving grace of the original Magical Quest was its inclusion of some multiplayer challenges that anyone with a second system could join in...without the need for a second cartridge. For whatever reason, Magical Quest 2 forgoes this element and depends solely on its main adventure for its entire gameplay. And since the game can be completed in a couple of hours with little to no challenge for the average gamer, the package just doesn't feel very complete. There's a good chance that anyone who wants a game starring Mickey Mouse is of the younger demographic, and this is the only thing that makes sense why Magical Quest 2 is so easy and simple to play. But it's misleading too, since the original game offered a lot more of a challenge...and anyone who actually enjoyed that game will come into Magical Quest 2 wondering when the difficulty level will start to increase. It doesn't. It's over too quickly. It's a game to get if you love the sense of accomplishment in beating videogames...but that's all that this game offers.", "date": "Nov 14, 2003"}
