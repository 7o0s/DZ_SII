The game expanded on what the team originally did for the superhero back in the Game Boy Color days, and the experience showed in a very solid GBA Spidey adventure. The team's latest comic book hero project is the GBA version of X2: Wolverine's Revenge, a game based upon characters from the upcoming X-Men film sequel, as well as the console action game of the same name. Again, the development team creates a really solid, well-designed action game that builds some great ideas around Wolverine's unique superhuman abilities. The game isn't super long or deep, but it's definitely a fun romp all the way through.Features Eight levels Unlockable Danger Rooms Cartridge save (four slots) Only for Game Boy AdvanceThe Game Boy Advance version of X2: Wolverine's Revenge is a strange amalgamation of styles; the game utilizes a blend of the Wolverine character from the Bryan Singer movie series, but drawn and portrayed in a comic book environment. The game is actually an original 2D design, but it's based upon the storyline and gameplay elements established by the Activision console game released day and date as this one. Players assume the role of the adamantium claw-wielding Canadian, Logan AKA Wolverine and work their way through eight different levels that span all over the world, uncovering a plot headed up by Magneto and his clan of evil mutants.To defeat the bad guys and stop their evil ways, players must put Wolverine's unique abilities to use. Early in the game, Wolverine's only got a few techniques at his disposal, and most of his more powerful and elaborate moves will be acquired from picking up specific power-ups scattered across the different levels. He can unsheathe and utilize his claws at any time during the action, and the designers do a great job balancing the gameplay to make it necessary to play with claws both retracted and extended. with the claws in, players can sneak up to enemies and attack in a ~stealth~ punch; Wolverine's self-healing mutant powers will also continuously regenerate his health bar when players keep his claws sheathed. When they're out, players can pull off more powerful attacks and combos against the onslaught of enemies, as well as utilize the earned ability of climbing the sides of walls by jamming his claws into the surface. Slashing frequently will build up Wolverine's ~rage~ meter, and when maxed out, players will go into a fury mode where attacks are doubled. But in this mode, players won't be able to use the wall climb ability, nor will they be able to pull their claws back in to regenerate or sneak around. And after rage mode ends, Logan will stumble around for a few seconds unable to attack. It's a good balance that really shows the designers were thinking when creating the game design around the character abilities.Several comic book action brawlers have come out for the Game Boy Advance, and most of them have had the same problem: wonky collision detection. It's frustrating to hack and slash at enemies with superhuman abilities without putting a dent in certain enemies; games like Daredevil on the GBA are prime suspects to this issue. X2: Wolverine's Revenge on the other hand, gets it right; the sprite interaction in this game is incredibly tight and responsive...players can (and will) juggle opponents in three hit attacks with rapid-fire pace.Even though X2: Wolverine Revenge is, at its core, an action brawler, there are some areas where players are encouraged to ~sneak around~ in places...sort of a side-scrolling Metal Gear Solid; alert the guards to your presence and you'll have to fend off a lot more opponents until they forget about you. And while these elements are a good idea, they're not implemented as well as they could have been; it's tough trying to portray ~stealth~ when there's only two directions for line-of-site. Enemies have a limited distance to ~see~ Wolverine, so players will have to do a little trial and error to gauge ~safe~ distances from the enemy; it does, admittedly, look a little stupid to have a character walk a few feet from him and turn the other direction as if Wolvie's not there.The GBA version of X2: Wolverine's Revenge is actually based upon Vicarious Vision's previous (and as yet unreleased) Bruce Lee game engine, which had more stealth elements in its design...even giving players areas to duck into so as not to alert the enemies. The only place players can ~hide~ in this game's stealth levels is behind indestructible crates (which, I guess, are laced with adamantium if Logan can't slash 'em open), so the ~strategy~ of stealth just isn't as prominent as it could (and should) have been. The game does a very rare special effect of pulling the camera back so players can see more of the area, but it never seems to pull back far enough to be worthwhile in these stealth missions.Since the game records progress as players complete the eight different levels, it also keeps track of how many lives and continues players have at their disposal. So, yes, it's possible to run out of continues on your way through the adventure. There are hidden treats in the game, and a little exploration around the levels will net extra guys and continues that will be helpful within the eight-level adventure. Players can also unlock Danger Rooms that they can slash through safely, and these rooms will award players an extra continue when completed.The game's not incredibly deep or difficult, but it is a good challenge for a comic book action game. It's also a great looking GBA title; characters have been rendered with several frames of animation per move, and the engine even uses the GBA's hardware capabilities to zoom in and out of the action. The stealth areas could have used a little more work, but overall the designers knew what they were doing when bringing Wolverine back to the small screen of the GBA system.", "date": "Apr 16, 2003"}
