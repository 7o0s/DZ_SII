Rival gangs now refuse to solve their turf disputes with simple knife and gun fights. Instead, a more civil approach has developed in the form of Freestyle Street Soccer.  This new breed of soccer returns futbol to the people. Games are held in warehouses, skate parks, and playgrounds. There aren't referees or rules. Style matters as much as the score. And, there's plenty of room for attitude, fighting, and showing off.    Freestyle Street Soccer takes bits of NBA Jam and pieces of NBA Street to form an urban soccer game. With all these games attempting to capitalize off Electronic Arts' Street formula, does Freestyle bring enough skill to the court or will it hang its head in defeat? Read on to find out.   The Facts  4 on 4 arcade soccer  Play as one of ten different gangs  Five game modes  Licensed soundtrack   Gameplay  Following the Street mentality, Freestyle Street Soccer presents futbol the way it would be played if you didn't have to worry about referees or common sense. The setting is a city torn apart by rival gangs like the BMX Crew, Skater Boys, Taggin' Crew and Street-Kai. Developer Silicon Dreams has incorporated every conceivable city faction and employed behavioral stereo types to give Freestyle authenticity, including gangsters, convicts, low rider gangs, and a Jamaican posse.    Helping infuse the sense of rivalry between gangs, Freestyle is filled with cut scenes depicting shoving, taunting, foul language, and celebration. You'll witness cheering, flips, break dancing, and somersaults. These are only a handful of the scenes, which are shown before every face off, so there's plenty of time to get sick of them.     These gangs are constantly fighting for each other's territory, which is the basis for Freestyle's primary game mode Turf Wars. Turf Wars is essentially a franchise mode where you have to defeat rival gangs (ten) to become the king of the land. With each successful win, you'll be awarded points that can be dispersed among your team's attributes (speed, power, skill, and shot). Once you've claimed all the turf, you'll unlock a new Home Turf mode. This is a reversal of roles -- you're the one being attacked. You'll have to win ten games in a row to avoid losing it all. Street Challenge is unlocked once you finish Home and Turf Wars. This acts as a normal franchise mode where you play an extended home and away season. There's also the option for a quick start, versus mode, and freestyle exhibition. These last three modes can all be played with one to four players (two per team). Freestyle is a bit different from the other modes because the winner is determined by style points instead of goals.   While the whole idea behind Street Soccer is rather absurd, it did have the potential to be an amusing title considering the popularity of NBA Street and NFL Street. Although Silicon Dream is adopting a successful idea into its game design, it doesn't improve upon the Street formula nor does it admirably employ it. Not only are there problems with the street-styled gameplay, but there are also flaws with Freestyle's basic functionality as a soccer title.   Since this is street soccer, players are able to flip, somersault, and hop with the ball, jumps off walls, juggle, cartwheel, break dance, and bicycle kick. It is rather rewarding to avoid a tackle by juggling the ball and then dropping the pass for a teammate sprinting up behind you who slams the ball into the net. But, the likelihood of such a play occurring is relatively slim.    You don't have full control of your character's actions. There are five stock skill moves your player can perform. All other showboating is automatic. Most of the crazy kicks or juggles that are performed before taking a shot are triggered by a one timer instead of your command. This isn't a problem if you only had to watch the game's repetitive animations. Unfortunately, even though your character is busy performing an automated juggle, you're still open to slide tackles and shoves. The net's wide open? Your character stops, performs a complicated trick, and right as he's about to shoot the ball is stolen.   The only good thing about this forced skill use is that it fills your skill meter. This gives you the opportunity to perform a Netbuster (similar to Street's GameBreaker). Once triggered, you'll need to dribble the ball into a glowing circle and press a combination of buttons to perform an uber powerful shot. But, this doesn't always work.  Half the time you run into the circle and press the requisite buttons nothing happens. You might run through three or four times before you actually set it off, which leaves you open to losing the ball and running out of time (you only have the ability for 20 seconds). The Netbusters themselves are far from impressive and, as with most things in Freestyle, you'll see the same animation far too often. The best part of it all is that your team will stand around watching this display of skill while holding their heads and shouting ~No!~ instead of rushing in to tackle the shooter.     It's sad that the ~street~ elements just aren't fun, but what's worse is that the actual soccer playing is abominable. Your teammates have no clue how to play the game. If you're chasing down an opponent and manage to knock the ball loose, your teammates will just gawk at the ball instead of grabbing it. In fact, your teammates are far from aggressive -- it's up to you to switch to the character closest to the ball or else lose possession. What's worse is your goalie makes the stupidest decisions. He often doesn't even make an attempt to stop shots. When you aren't actually able to control what he does with the ball (which is often), your goalie tends to pass the ball directly to the opposite team or to a player standing right in front of him instead of passing up the field.    The camera is incredibly close to the field, which means you can only see a small section of the action at any given time. You'll rarely be able to see markers pointing out where your teammates are located, which results in many blind passes. While this works in some games by passing to the nearest person, Street Soccer will often pass the ball to no one. Even with all these factors working against you, it's still easy to beat the computer by eight points in a given match on medium difficulty.    Graphics  Freestyle Street Soccer looks like someone ran a painting through the wash. While the backdrops are diverse, everything looks like it's based off the same model. Textures are muddled. There's very little detail. The rain effects even resemble rain from the Streets of Rage days.    Character models hold up decently when you're playing, but when they're zoomed in for the several ~attitude~ building elements they look incredibly basic and angular. These flaws are pointed out every time you're at a face off.    There's also the problem of the magna-ball. The soccer ball stays magnetized to the dribbler's feet -- moving unnaturally with the way a character is running (akin to Sega Soccer Slam). It's distracting to see the ball bouncing out in front of the character, seemingly held at a given distance to the player's feet. This causes several problems with possession because you'll think you have the ball when you actually don't.     Sound  The one thing Freestyle has going for it is a decent soundtrack. Saliva, Method Man, Feeder, TLC, Queens of the Stone Age, Oxide and Neutrino, Kid Frost, and Buju Banton all make appearances. While having recognizable songs is a big plus, the track you listen to is dependent on stadium you're playing in. So, you'll hear ~Come Back Around~ endlessly looped while playing in the skate park. A little more variety would have really helped out.   There aren't many noticeable sound effects besides for the sound of your feet hitting rubber, but you will be treated to a lot of cheesy dialogue. Whether it's taunts between teams or teammates, the clips are frequently recycled and add little enjoyment to the game. ~Hey man, why's your a** getting beat?~ and ~I'm not gonna take that s***!~ is some of the more noticeable dialogue.   I'm an avid fan of soccer and soccer games (primarily Winning Eleven). After the success of NBA Street I thought that Freestyle Street Soccer might offer a good diversion when I wasn't looking for serious international competition. Unfortunately, not only does Freestyle not improve upon the Street formula, it doesn't even attempt to emulate it. The single player is more a trial of frustration than anything else. Players don't behave the way they should. Ball physics are ridiculous. The whole gang turf war theme is absurd -- and in many ways insulting. Rounding out this stellar package is the horrid attitude displays that you see at least twenty times during a game (and the same animations are used in every game). It's not fun -- just boring. Multiplayer doesn't even spark much life into Freestyle. Freestyle Street Soccer might hold your attention for an hour or so, but once you've gotten over the novelty of performing tricks, you'll realize that this just the discarded skin of a soccer game.
