The ones that go on for pages and pages about what could have been, what should have been, and how terrible it was for die-hard Star Wars fans to be let down by Jedi Power Battles. And though its release came on the RAM-biased PlayStation, even the folks here at IGNDC couldn't figure out how so many things could go so terribly wrong.  After all, the list of problems were immense; Horribly dark graphics, murky color palettes, unforgivable control issues, and a score that sounded like it was synthesized through a soda can is as generous a description that we can muster. Harsh as that may be, it only begins to describe what a mess Jedi Power Battles truly was.  Unfortunate really. As a genuinely kick-ass idea (take the cast from the latest Star Wars flick and throw them into a tribute to the old 16-bit SNES platformers with updated visuals), had apparently been impaled with its own lightsaber. Dead and buried alongside other such licensed disasters as The Flintstones and every other Batman offering, we had thought we'd seen the last of our nightmare. We could all now crawl into our beds and dream of the fluffy white clouds of Bespin, hoping that the better Star Wars games would come zooming into our lives once again... And then the news of a Dreamcast version of Power Battles came down the pipeline, and everybody held their breath.  But to our biggest, most jaw-dropping surprise... It was actually kind of all right.  Easily one of the best clean up jobs I have seen for a title in a long time, Jedi Power Battles has fixed a whole slew of the aforementioned problems, and then some. Graphically, audibly, and even mechanically, this is a far superior product to the one we saw on our PlayStations a few months ago. In fact, the difference is so dramatic that a betting man may argue that the game was completely remade from the ground up entirely (The environments and characters were remodeled from scratch, so it's pretty close).  The most noticeable improvement comes with the visuals. A hundred times cleaner than its 32-Bit counterpart, the high-resolution, 60 Frames Per Second cornea massage appears to be rather impressive. More detailed textures and bright well-blended colors add to the package too, and if you sit the two versions of the game next to each other, the difference is quality is so great it's startling.  Additional visual tweaks have been made in other areas too; Camera angles, lighting effects, and force powers have each been given the upgrade, and the queasy badly-adjusted camera from the lesser version has been canned as well. Even the levels themselves have been slightly redesigned, and sport more realistic object placement than previously. Instead of running into that random computer hub in the middle of the hallway like we use to do, we can now easily walk around it with its position on the side where it belongs. Finally, the user interface has been streamlined for good measure and clutters the screen a lot less than before.  Not to say that it still doesn't have its graphical gripe or two. Like the bizarre cloud of a polygon strobe ghost that finds its way into the strangest of places (like on level one, where that odd mass of spasm seemingly floats over the hydraulic press machines for no apparent reason). Or the way certain larger structures will pop in and out of the screen in a ~now you see me, now you don't~ sort of a way (example: The Monster tank chasing you and Jar Jar through the swamps of Naboo). And while these kind of problems only seem to occur once or twice per level, they're still big enough to make you wonder if the game was completely finished before roll out.  Luckily, the ear food isn't quite as washy. Flawless in all categories (speech, ambiance, blaster noise... you name it), the tired-sounding mono heap that was on the PlayStation disc is now a distant memory. Whether it's Duel of the Fates that you're hearing, or just a common lightsaber ~swish~ cutting through your opponent, the soundtrack is definitely Star Wars.  The largest area of complaint in the first game however, had to be the piss-poor area of control. I mean let's face it, on the PlayStation it literally feasted on an all you can eat buffet of frog ass. Especially when it came to successfully jumping from platform to platform without falling to your death a thousand times. If this Dreamcast revision had any hope of gaining back the fans it lost after the last fiasco, then this issue would have to be addressed before the final run.  The good news is that it was. Much easier to control than before, and no longer a total frustration workout, the quest to leap from place to place is a much more comfortable proposition. The bad news is, that it wasn't tweaked enough.  Still too difficult when it comes to adjusting to the proper direction to attack an approaching opponent (even with the auto-aim button pressed), overwhelmed with far too many controller motions to do your desired move quickly, and plagued by collision issues, the game still has a quite a number of mechanical faults. An improvement over its older cousin yes, but still a troublesome conclave of curse words nonetheless. Forgivable perhaps if these problems only come to pass now and again while immersed in the game, but not so if they continue to hound you throughout... which they do.  Which is truly an unfortunate fact about Jedi Power Battles, it just wasn't meant to be great. Sure it's a cleaner, faster, and deeper product than it once was, but it doesn't have the right gameplay elements to truly put it over the top. Despite a boastful collection of Extra characters, modes, and secrets, the biggest element of them all: a great sense of fun, is just a bit on the low side.  Not a terrible title by any means, LucasArts has improved on their past mistakes admirably in their attempt to make a better game. They just haven't quite figured out how do it all the way yet. A good one the first couple of sessions but an eventual disappointment, Power Battles is probably best described by our wise and powerful Master Yoda. Who once said, ~Do or do not. There is no try.~ Too true little green guy, too true.  -- Jeremy Dunham, IGNDC This is the third time I've played through this game (once on PlayStation, once more with the GBC game Obi-Wan, which was sort of a simplified version of this with some puzzles added, and now on GBA). All the versions have one deadly flaw - the Jedi are as agile as carp out of water. Too bad that the designers didn't fix the flaws for the GBA game -- it could have been a thrill. Yet, in the end, the dark side remains.", "date": "Oct 5, 2000"}
