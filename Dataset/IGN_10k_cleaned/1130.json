Are you at least ready to sorta roll? OK then, let's get started. You'll be doing neither in Third Law's shooter, KISS Psycho Circus. While you may sway at times, and possibly even tilt forward and backward a little, there's definitely no rockin' and/or rollin' to be had within the pixels of this game. First off, if you didn't have a chance to read my first impressions, give them a peek -- it will give you some info on my initial feelings about the game. After a full day of playing, I was worried that the game would keep the same solid but uninventive momentum, and I was more than a little annoyed by some of the funkier glitches in the final version of the game. While a new patch has been released, fixing most of the problems I had with KISS Psycho Circus, some of you with TNT cards will freak out about the in-game menu problems and keyboard glitches that plague the pre-patch version of the game. That being said, once you get past some technical problems, it's time to get into the meat of the matter -- is this going to entertain you all night long, or not?  You'll put yourself in the shoes of four different characters, each slowly gaining armor and weapons to become one of four different super-powerful entities who look remarkably similar to your favorite four KISS rockers. The armor gives you access to new areas in each level (such as boots that allow you to jump higher), or adds to your overall strength and total health. Get all the armor, including the mask, and you'll be a fighting machine with a special unique power to pummel your foes with. Each character also has their own unique melee weapon, which I've described in my first impressions. You can play the game out of order, but if you follow the storyline, you'll start with Paul Stanley, er, the Starbearer as you enter the water realm. While each character infiltrates their own separate realm, the general gameplay and enemies you'll encounter will feel very similar, although there are a few unique monsters and tricks for each realm. And that's it -- run in, destroy the spawners as quickly as possible, do a lot of backpedaling, curse at the interminably slow shotgun, and move your way to the next map.  KISS Psycho Circus is not Half-Life, nor does it try to be. This is a straightforward fragfest with an emphasis on ammo-pumping. You'll see more enemies on screen in Psycho Circus than any other shooter, sometimes in ridiculously entertaining amounts. Spawners, organic versions of a hostess cupcake factory, keep weak enemies coming a la' Gauntlet until you destroy them, and on top of the spawned enemies, the game will also plain toss enemies in front of you at times just to keep things stressful. There are some great moments, when you'll walk into a warehouse to find dozens of enemies crashing through the glass ceiling, or a cavalcade of fire-emblazoned headless creatures surrounding you in frightening numbers. Psycho Circus' other contribution to the shooter market are the health bars, which give you the health of nearby enemies, a fantastic feature that gives you the room to run in blazing, or hold back and take some potshots, depending on the strength of the enemy. Like any shooter, there are some key/door puzzles, but they're kept simple and easy to wrangle, with more work spent trying to get to the key (usually clearly visible) than actually trying to find it on a large map. Thank god. It looks as if the Third Law team has definitely learned a few things from working on the bloated and downright confusing layout of Daikatana. Where Daikatana tried to ~innovate~ through the use of such things as pointless new weapon types and horrible jumping puzzles, Psycho Circus gives you slight variants on old weapon favorites and levels which look new but feel familiar. Unfortunately, while this definitely works better than Daikatana's fumblings steps, it falls under its own trap. While there are some small new features in Psycho Circus, overall the game feels like a lot of shooters you've played before, which in our bloated shooter market is about as dangerous as making a platormer was at the end of the SNES's life.  Because the game focuses on action almost solely, you'll definitely be kept busy -- but sometimes the game design does this at the expense of everything else. While it's a great concept to put spawners in a shooter to keep a stream of enemies coming at you, I'm not such a fan of the ~let's drop twenty beasts behind his head when he thinks the room is empty~ philosophy, especially when it's really hard to tell where you're being attacked from. Sometimes the monster poppin' technique works, but later in the game it can be absolutely fist-pounding, especially when you can't help but think that the game is just playing cheap by having monsters just appear, or even re-appear when you past certain points, without any clues. Just trying working through some of the later levels, and you'll see where this trick can really suck the joy out of levels, to the point where you'll be quicksaving like someone with obsessive compulsive disorder just to move to the next level.  The weapons don't help matters much, either. You'll feel Quake in each and every new weapon you get in the game, from the railgun/rope pinpoint punch of the whip to the standard shotgun/plama gun variants. Unfortunately, weapon switching is incredibly slow, and items like the shotgun take way too long to reload, especially when quicker weapons are laughably weak against most enemies in the game. And Psycho Circus' variant on the grenade is a messy affair that isn't powerful enough to cause critical damage to important enemies, but is bouncy and annoying enough to cause you death and misery. Most confusing is the spray of weapons like the shotgun and the game's take on the rocket launcher -- one minute nearby enemies are taking major damage from spray, the next it seems as if you need pinpoint accuracy to cause any damage to your targeted foe. All of this sounds finicky, but we're reaching critical mass when it comes to shooters on the PC, so you tend to get particular about what feels right and what doesn't in a game like this.   The look is clean, with a different color palette reflecting each realm, including the colors of some of the common creatures. Third Law has done a lot of nice things with the LithTech engine, and it's definitely impressive to see just how many creatures they can throw on a screen at one time, without bringing your computer to a halt. While outdoor environments aren't as impressive as the indoor structures, they aren't an eyesore, and overall the art staff has done a great job of keeping the KISS references coming, and the look of the game gothic but much more colorful and vibrant than the competition.  Unfortunately, while the graphics are entertaining, the music is a big, big disappointment. While I can swallow not using the real-life personalities of the band, since this is based on the comic, I can't deal with a game based on musicians that features sub-par in-game music. You'd think that a KISS game would use hour after hour of hot KISS tunes, but you'd think wrong. While you'll hear a variety of KISS music through your travels, it's always connected to a stereo or jukebox within the game, used as a special addition rather than an integral part of the game itself, which frankly it should be. Instead, what you get is bad MIDI guitar tracks that aren't just forgettable, but actually take away from the overall quality of game. There were times when I actually wanted to hold back and stand by a jukebox for a while, just so I could get my KISS fix and avoid having to listen to more of the tedious in-game tunes. Couldn't you have at least used real guitars and instruments for the tracks? Making sound the lowest on the totem pole for a game based on a band just doesn't seem like a good idea.  Last but not least, let's talk a lil' multiplayer. The weapons don't lend themselves very well to multiplayer (try smacking someone with a whip), and while you can setup 16 players online, there isn't a matching service -- read, full support of the multiplayer game. The single player game is fairly long however, so you can count the multiplayer features of Psycho Circus more as a mark on the checklist of bullet points for the back of the box than as a full-featured addition to the game as a whole.  KISS Psycho Circus has moments of fun, but it never quite breaks away from the path set by the umpteen shooters that have come before it. Spawners and health meters are great touches, but if there isn't a foundation of inventive gameplay, and a good story to back it up, you quickly lose interest. For a game based on such vibrant characters, the designers have managed to make KISS Psycho Circus feel more like a VH1 documentary than a big, loud rock spectacle. Hopefully the KISS Alive game will fare better.  -- Vincent Lopez    Comment on this story", "date": "Jul 28, 2000"}
