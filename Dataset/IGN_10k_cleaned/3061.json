An evil wizard named Hexis is using the magic of nature and death to wreak terrible destruction across the land. Earthquakes, floods and direct mail marketing campaigns are sweeping across the land and (big surprise) it's up to you to stop it.   I played through a lot of the recent Heroes IV when it first came out. While I liked the game a great deal, I criticized it for the curious lack of multiplayer. Still, the single player component was robust enough that the criticism didn't amount to much. Now 3DO and New World have finally made an expansion that not only adds multiplay options (previously available as an upgrade for Heroes IV), but also includes a series of campaigns nearly as rich as those in Heroes IV.   The are six new campaigns in The Gathering Storm Are all much more tied together than the fairly independent stories of the basic game. Where the first game simply included a few minor and incidental ties between the campaigns, this time around they're all part of a much larger story. At least, they all come together as part of a single story once you reach the final campaign. It begins with Agraynel the Bard. She's on a quest to locate three legendary artifacts owned by an even greater, deader bard. As she seeks these artifacts out, strange forces begin to block her path.   The same is true for the hero of the second campaign, Bohb the archmage. Bohb's on a search for five artifacts, all of which were owned by a greater, deader mage named Nevar.  Each artifact is in the possession of a particular wizard, each of whom takes full advantage of their power to thwart old Bohb. Then there's the wizard Kozuss. He's on the trail of three artifacts that will grant him mastery of the magic of Order and Chaos.   Fourth in the list is the dark priestess Alita Eventide. She's trying to make off with two diametrically opposed artifacts, the Ring of Light and the Cloak of Darkness, which will give her powers over life and death. Finally, the warrior Dogwoggle seeks the Armor of the Tiger, which is held in various parts by three mad brothers who each rule a small kingdom.   Each of these groups of artifacts the heroes discover are meant to be used together. The Armor of the Tiger grants, in addition to the several various benefits of the items, the added benefits of Regeneration and Dragon Strength. The Ring of Light and Cloak of Darkness give the owning hero a Guardian Angel at the start of each combat. The heroes themselves, now in possession of these artifacts, are meant to work together as well, this time in the final campaign. The five heroes all meet up together for this final massive fight against Hexis. As I said, along with the multiplayer options, the extended campaign is the big attraction for the expansion.  It offers a chance to get acquainted with and attached to a wide group of heroes in a wide array of settings.    Now, the multiplayer game is played via Gamespy, and as a rule I dislike third-party matchmaking services. It's not that I have anything against Gamespy necessarily -- it's just that I hate having to jump between programs to find games. The benefits of having something like Gamespy include their extensive community features but these are less critical to the game's success and enjoyment than a convenient way to get in to a game. Here you have to launch the Gamespy browser to find the rooms and then launch the game to start the match. The aggravations of third-party matchmaking can be avoided with direct IP connections, but you have to know the addresses beforehand.    There aren't too terribly many people playing the game currently but there's usually someone on who's willing to play. Now that the expansion's out in stores, more people will start showing up on the servers. You won't have much luck in finding games for four or more players, but I rarely had to wait for more than a few minutes to find at least one person to play with. Since you can assign other roles to the computer, you can even play on the larger maps with just two players. Sadly, the number of maps you can play in multiplayer are pretty limited.   Game saves are allowed so you needn't finish a game all at once. I've seen a few dropouts during multiplayer matches but you can always assign dropped player slots to be taken over by the PC. The manual doesn't explain how to tell if the drops I've seen have been bugs or uninterested players. In fact, the manual doesn't really mention multiplayer at all which seems kind of puzzling to me.   But as glad as I am for those two big additions in the area of single and multiplayer scenarios, there are a few things I'd like to see. While the multi-class hero system was one of the best features of the last game, I wish more effort had been placed in adding a few more classes to it. In the current system, your heroes gain special abilities based on their two highest skill sets. You could specialize a particular hero by focusing on life magic and lordship and this would give him a different set of bonuses than a hero who focuses on life magic and tactics. While a new skill group is probably not needed, it would be cool neat to see at least some expansion of the hero classes. At least the expansion includes conservatories, new map locations that let you buy spells for your heroes, and coliseums, new locations that let your heroes level faster.    What did you think of Heroes of Might and Magic IV: The Gathering Storm? If I can see why the team didn't offer new heroes, I'm less willing to accept the lack of new creatures. Four new units are far too few for me, particularly since they're all high-level units that are used by Hexis. Id' have loved to see some more units spread around a bit (or perhaps even bolstering the meager list of Order creatures fromHeroes IV). As it is, you need some remedy from the things like the Gargantuan and Dark Champions Hexis uses and some cool, more generally available units would've been nice.   Other than that, the expansion preserves all of the wonderful features of Heroes IV. Cool battles are still the focus, with a hefty dose of roleplaying character development adding a bit of continuity to it all. A wide range of units and a fable-like atmosphere throughout let armies of griffins and archers wage war against ice demons and skeleton warriors.  There's little better than a beefy expansion for a game you love. With this one you're not only getting the much needed multiplayer code, but you're getting a very well-developed series of campaigns that, by themselves, are plenty of entertainment. You can get quite a bit of mileage out of this one and, since the campaigns are so tied together, there's more incentive to play them all.I'm a bit irritated by the inconvenience of the multiplayer front-end but I'll take what I can get. The lack of players is something we can't do anything about but we assume numbers will swell the longer the game's been out. Perhaps it would help if there were more multiplayer maps to begin with.Call me ungrateful, but after those two big additions, I still want more. The game disappoints with a lack of new heroes and new units. I still give this one a recommendation to fans of turn-based fantasy strategy games. Disciples II has better graphics and Age of Wonders has better empire elements but Heroes has them both beat on tactics and adventure.", "date": "Oct 14, 2002"}
