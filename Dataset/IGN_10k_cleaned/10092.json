Patapon takes the visual style of a game like Loco Roco and combines it with a Pikmin or Lemmings-like hands-off strategy mentality, fused with a Dance Dance Revolution or Rez-style focus on layered rhythms and timing. That's a really roundabout way of saying that Patapon takes a lot of cues from many excellent games, creating something almost as fun and original as developer Interlink's PaRappa the Rapper.   The Patapon, a species of war-fuelling, monocular tribesmen, look to you as their Almighty  their ultimate deity and provider of food and creature comforts. The game actually begins with you 'signing' an agreement to look after them. They, in turn, worship and adore you, sacrificing the heads of the foes they smite on a (presumably blood-drenched) altar to you. Sounds like a fair trade to us. The other side of the game's story is the Patapon's continued search for the mysterious, shining 'IT' which lies at Earthend  and they want you to guide them to this Mecca of sorts.   Progression, exploration and combat are almost entirely out of your direct control. After being gifted with sacred drums, you command your Patapon followers by tapping out short rhythms on the PSP's face buttons. These beats must be landed precisely in time with a flashing single line border around the screen. As you complete each rhythm, the Patapon echo it back to you in their squeaky, sing-songy voices, and they proceed with whatever you've just instructed them to do. In practice, it ends up following this kind of pattern: Pata-pata-pata-pon. (Pata-pata-pata-pon!) Pon-pon-pata-pon. (Pon-pon-pata-pon!) Chakka-chakka-pata-pon. (Chakka-chakka-pata-pon!) And so on.     The timing of this core mechanic takes a little getting used to  there is a learning curve involved, but it's gradual enough that you're never going to be completely overwhelmed by any split-second decisions or incoming swarm of evil tribesmen until you're some way into the adventure. The difficulty does eventually ramp up, requiring better management of your Patapon soldiers and a little bit of backtracking too.   Patapon's structure is interesting. On the surface, this is literally a linear adventure; you urge the Patapon forward at all times under the almost hypnotic rhythms you tap out. Along the way, they must knock down walls, kill wild birds and giant boars, take out the enemy Zigoton tribe, summon monsoonal rainstorms, take out guard towers and generally press onwards towards 'IT'. Backtracking to find new beats and weapons becomes essential six or seven stages in; taking cues from the strategy genre, it's also essential to manage your squad of troops.   This squad management is governed by Ka-ching, an experience-points system that allows you to unlock extra troops to bulk out the ranks, which are divided into four positions  - distance attackers like bowmen and spearmen stay towards the back with the flag bearer, while axemen and your hardcore warriors lead the charge. Surprisingly, there's a deep RPG-like item and stat management system built into the gameplay. It determines everything from your standard attack and defence levels as well as things like individual troop HP and the effects of equipping new armour, weapons, helmets, shields and more.    The whole world is alive with animation and the heavy emphasis on contrast makes for a very alien and surreal landscape.  In some ways, this level of depth is almost moot to many players  and we think the developer realised this, since there's the option to automatically outfit your squad with the most appropriate gear with a touch of the Triangle button on the pre-mission screen. Honestly, unless you get a kick out of fine-tuning every aspect of each Patapon, this is the option to go for; it virtually eliminates human error and imbalance.    Patapolis is the hubworld  a few screen-lengths of totems, altars, monoliths and a strange musical minigame that has you mimicking the warbling tones of a giant, itchy tree in order to obtain tree branches. It's strange, but that's Patapon; it's endearing and quirky, but at least it never deviates from this offbeat formula. By the end of the game, you'll think nothing of combining sticks, stones, meat, cabbages and other odds and ends to create tiny eyeball-drum people with weapons and a love for the groove.   Fever Mode, the frenzied state of attack and movement, is triggered by repeatedly inputting the perfect rhythm. After five chains, the sound effects start to layer, adding new beats and effects to the mix. After ten combos, Frenzy Mode is activated and will continue until you mess up or lose the beat. This mechanic is actually one of the only real frustrations we have with Patapon's rhythm input mechanic.    Once you start a combo streak, you're stuck playing non-stop  potentially for the rest of the level, which can take ten minutes or more on some stages. This makes the lack of a true pause function a really weird design decision; you cannot pause and hold the rhythm, so if you need to step away from your PSP to answer the phone or put out a fire in the kitchen, you're going to lose your combo and leave yourself entirely vulnerable to attack. A very strange and occasionally very frustrating design decision.    Reaching ten combos is easy  but strangely, the game itself actually throws you off the rhythm by mixing in an out-of-sync cheer into the melody. It's a little unforgiving to expect players to retain the beat when the background beat suddenly gets drowned out. At times, the best way to play the game is to look away from the screen and block out any other distractions around you.   Because of this, the PSP is almost fundamentally the wrong platform for a game like Patapon. My rationale behind a comment like that is this; for a system with tinny-sounding, fairly average sound, the default beats get drowned out. This makes a pair of quality headphones essential. Also, by the nature of the portable itself, really getting into the rhythm can be tricky just using your thumbs. A game like this almost demands a Rock Band-style drum pad where you can take advantage of a full range of movement, rather than just feeding your RSI-plagued thumbs.   Yeah, uh, so this is this tree that, uh, sings to you because it's, erm... itchy.  Those quirks and issues barely register in the overall scheme of things. Patapon is inventive and charming visually, even if it can be derivative at times from a rhythm-game perspective. The landscape is rendered in slick, high contrast colour schemes, rendered with thick lines that give the whole game a flash-animation effect, most reminiscent of Loco Roco. The Patapon people themselves, while little more than circles of black and white, are hugely expressive thanks to their cyclopean appearance. They fall over, talk to you with pop-up speech bubbles and trek across the lands with fluid animation and personality. As the game progresses and you start tackling the larger Patapon-devouring bosses or you begin to acquire weapons with neat magical effects, the subtlety of the gorgeous 2D effects shines through. This is a striking looking game and more proof (if it were really needed) that 3D isn't the be-all and end-all.   A quirky orchestral score sets the mood of the game nicely during Patapolis interludes, but the real star of the game is the rhythm layering applied during Fever Mode moments, where the game kicks in with all sorts of amazing looping effects and beats. Awesome stuff. However, again we strongly recommend that you either play this game in peace and quiet somewhere, or you invest in a decent pair of over-ear headphones. You'll be thankful you did.   Patapon takes its cues from a heritage of music and rhythm games, but develops a charming and compelling hands-off strategy-music-RPG. It's one of the few games on the PSP that really stands out on shelves, mainly because it isn't a port and it's just so darned unique on the platform. It's not for everyone; it's a shame that Australians didn't have direct access to the demo that the US market did through some retail chains. Of course, if you like any of the gameplay elements that comprise Patapon, then chances are, the rhythm's gonna get under your skin. Pata-pata-pata-pon!", "date": "Feb 28, 2008"}
