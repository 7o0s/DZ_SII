MTV Music Generator 3: This is the Remix does just that and it does it so well that it makes the whole thing look easy. That's no accident since this title has some fresh, clean design that makes you wonder why it hasn't been done before.   With plenty of tools that are easily accessible for newcomers and plenty of tricks up its sleeve for those who are willing to spend the time and dig a little deeper. MTVMG3 provides plenty of audio thrills and offers several different areas for users to stretch out their creative side and get funky. If you want to show the world that you have a bumping masterpiece in you, then this is an excellent way to begin.   Gameplay?  There is no gameplay here whatsoever; it's all about the music. The previous MTVMG games had a jam session where multiple users could play around with sound sets together and make a racket, but that's been dropped. Personally, I'll never miss that ~feature~ since it was more hassle than it was worth. Another missing function is the music video arrangement. Since it was really more about sequencing different screensavers in time to the changes in the music, it was a vestigial tail that this latest phase of evolution has thankfully shed.    Is it too bad that these are gone and people are getting less value for their money? Not at all. Coinciding with this extra clutter, the previous versions had a lot of features, but the user interface was a colossal failure. The approach before was in trying to mimic a PC program, all the way down to using the left analog stick to control a cursor like a mouse. The learning curve was steep and not entirely worth it. It was a mess and MTVMG3 has fixed all that, so now let's make some music.   Slanted BeatBox What It Is  MTVMG3 comes with 10 different songs to mess with from artists such as Sean Paul, Outkast, Snoop Dogg, Carl Cox, and six others. The styles of music represent a variety of beat-based club-style music. There is no rock or funk or punk or anything guitar-based, it's really about looping and getting some solid rhythms together to build a song. There's some hip-hop and some dancehall, but there's also the strong club contingent with house, trance, drum'n'bass, and breakbeat as well.    By jumping into the Remixer mode, users can look at the 10 included songs and do some basic changes like tweaking the sound levels or the styles of drums, but the real game is in the Studio. Here is where the magic happens. All the songs get 24 different tracks to lay down music and all of the elements of the song are represented by squares or rectangles that sit on the different tracks. These shapes represent a length of audio that's one to four bars long on the timeline. By choosing the different audio clips and placing them down, a song is formed, piece by piece.    By loading up one of the songs in the Studio, users can see the song in a visual way and start to tweak the elements or rip it apart completely. Since each song has hundreds of associated samples that fit in the same key and style, each one is also a launching pad for creating other songs in the same genre. It may look simple to begin with, but the whole thing becomes more powerful with more practice. With the previous titles, this has been done before, but what makes this title stand out is that it's so easy to pull off.   That Awesome Interface  The overall look of the user interface here is so clean and easy to read and navigate that getting around is a no-brainer. Most importantly, the Studio is also easy to navigate. Samples are broken up into four categories (Drums, Bass, Riffs, and Vocals) and each category has a box on the side of the Studio. Pulling in elements requires only a couple button taps to choose a sample and then a couple more to drop it in. The timeline can be easily navigated and even cut and pasted to repeat multi-track chunks. The whole process ceases to be a process at all and really just an intuitive experience.   This theme spreads into the other areas where users can create their own sounds. Drum loops and melodies can be quickly created and tested and tweaked and warped pretty much endlessly. In the process of making a track, I found myself getting lost in the process of making multiple drum loops and forgot that I was working on a song at all. The melody maker is a little more difficult for those who aren't as familiar with that crazy musical notation stuff, but it's still a breeze to play with.    The most intricate aspect of the audio clip creation is the ripping of samples from CDs. Of all the process, I found this to be the most problematic at first. There were occasions where the program would rip an eight-second sample incorrectly and put in short silences in the middle. By re-ripping it, I was able to get a clean sample, but it was a curious thing. After that, it takes some finesse to get the samples in correctly so they come out clean.   This is a place where the tutorials came in extremely handy. There is a slick tutorial that runs through the whole program and breaks down the major features, but it's the always available help that makes this title rule. For every function, there is help that can be immediately accessed and it darkens half the screen to provide info about every aspect from creating a sample from a song to figuring out what the filters do. If anything, this title deserves a medal for making this whole experience accessible for everyone who picks it up.   Even after learning the basics and mastering the sampling technique, the timeline still has some cool effects to play with. Filters, reverb, and delay can all be thrown in for some more extensive tweaking. It's all thrown in and even these are as fluid as the rest. They'll be more used by the more devoted users, but it's great to see that even these haven't been forgotten about.    It may sound vague, but the overall feeling that MTVMG3 provides is that of something that is welcoming and helpful, but also provides so many kick-ass elements that it's hard to really find fault with it. Aside from many limitations that are really inherent to the consoles themselves, such as unlimited memory or storage or a larger screen to see more tracks, it almost seems pointless to start picking faults. But, since that's our job, we'll do it anyway.   Green Channel Menus What's Missing?  There are a few drawbacks, it's true. It would be better if the drum loops and melodies could be two bars long or more so that longer builds could be created. It's also curious as to why there's no sequencer for creating bass lines either. Both of these can be sidetracked by creating pairs of one-bar loops or creating melodies with bassy instruments, but these would have been welcome additions. There could also have been more samples and more music and more genres and, well, the more you play, the more you want so let's hope that these guys make a sequel.   Still, it's a damn shame that there's no online component, but with all the samples I can imagine that that would become a massive legal nightmare within the first day of release. After making a song, the only way to share it with others is to load it up or record it out to another device via the audio cables. It would have been amazing to download remixes or new creations from around the world. Maybe next time.There may be more powerful tools that are available for making music on a PC, but these start at around $100 and move on up to at least $300 for a copy of Reason. That's not even including the cost of the PC itself. To be able to pick up MTVMG3 for a console and have a system that is cleanly designed and easy to make music on is pretty much amazing. Sure, the music styles may favor the more electronic music sounds and if that doesn't appeal to you then this could be a problem, but other than that, it's hard to find much that really went wrong here aside from some small issues.
