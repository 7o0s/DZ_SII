Its sophisticated yet decadent brutally religiously filled the seats at Madison Square Garden in New York City. This decade, things have taken a turn for the worse. Whether it's dearth of in-ring action, controversial decisions, washed-up competitors or the very personable Mike Tyson, audiences across America shell out more money for wrestling PPVs than WBA title fights. A sad commentary to say the least. On the bright side, when you're down in the gutter, there's nowhere to go but up.   This theory also applies to the world of videogames. EA Sports released its first boxing game last year, and while the original Knockout Kings finally brought this illustrious sport to the PS console, it had its share of problems. Before writing this review, I decided to play the original again for comparative purposes. Within minutes, I remembered why it was hidden way under my bed. The graphics were below average at best, and the gameplay was awful. Boxers responded poorly to user control, displayed awkward footwork and had few in-ring maneuvers -- bad signs for any boxing simulator. You could create a fighter, battle against 20 competitors and literally win the championship in one sitting. Although the original was a best seller, developers have made every effort this time around to create a better overall product.  Gameplay Options in this game are similar to its predecessor, including exhibitions, slugfests and career mode. There's also a new category, appropriately titled ~classic fights.~ Relive famous rivalries, like Ali-Frazier, Holmes-Norton and Duran-Camacho. Try to change the outcome of history's greatest fights, and in case you don't remember what happened during these bouts, peruse the pre-match info. It's very informative.   During exhibitions, remember that you can only fight within your weight class. If you pick a heavyweight, your hand is forced into battling another heavyweight. It's good practice, but if you want to throw practicality out the window, try the slugfest. No refs, no rules -- just pure mayhem. Test your boxer's limits by pairing lightweights against bigger opponents or vice-versa. I recommend Butterbean versus Pernell ~Sweet Pea~ Whitaker in an all-out battle to determine the greatest legume on earth. (Bad joke, I know.)   Slugfest represents the arcade portion of Knockout Kings 2000 -- much different from the exhibition and career modes, which are pure boxing simulators. Your objective in the slugfest is to batter an opponent until he's out for the 10-count. Every successful punch landed raises your power meter, found directly under the health bar. When the meter is full, you'll see a flashing glove, which means you're ready to deliver a knockout blow. Press the triangle and square buttons simultaneously, and your boxer will throw the unblockable punch, usually an uppercut. Seeing the other guy flip over before hitting the mat is not only a cool effect, but also rewarding.   No matter how you dissect this game, career mode is inevitably its most memorable feature. Compared to last year's version, this one has loads of options. For instance, before creating a boxer, you must select one gym from the U.S., Japan or Europe for your training. In between fights, the boxer will fortify his skills, gaining points in non-interactive and interactive training. The latter enables you to learn more boxing techniques first-hand on a punching bag. If you have a good workout, you'll earn more points and increase your fighter's chances of moving up the rankings.   As far as creating custom players, the options have improved slightly from last year. It's still not as good as wrestling games like WWF Attitude, which lets you personalize brawlers all the way down to their shades and tattoos, but it's getting there. Unique face wrap technology lets you get up close and personal with your fighter, whether you want a conservative Joe or a wild, multi-colored afro pumpkin-freak.   When distributing skill points, try to spread the wealth in every category. In last year's version, you could essentially ignore factors like speed, chin and heart, concentrating solely on power. There was no need to block your opponent's punches. If you were stronger, you could take him out and absorb his punishment at the same time. Out-slugging your opponent was a cheap yet effective way to win. That isn't the case with KK 2000. The AI gets better and smarter while your boxer moves up the ranks. If you haven't learned to block by the time you fight the tenth best guy in your weight class, say goodnight papi. The computer will knock you out in the first round. Learn to stick and move. Avoid a straight-up slugfest in career mode. Since its simulation, you must learn the art of boxing to be successful -- a refreshing and necessary change from KK 99.   For those dying to know exactly who's in the game, here's the full list of boxers:  Muhammad Ali  Alexis Arguello  Frank Bruno Hector Camacho Oba Carr Julio Cesar Chavez  Oscar De La Hoya Jack Dempsey  Roberto Duran Eric ~Butterbean~ Esch Joe Frazier  Michael Grant  Marvin ~Marvelous~ Hagler  Larry Holmes  Evander Holyfield Ingemar Johanson Mark ~Too Sharp~ Johnson  Kevin Kelley  Jake Lamotta Sugar Ray Leonard Lennox Lewis Sonny Liston Danny ~Little Red~ Lopez Joe Louis  Ray ~Boom Boom~ Mancini Angel Manfredy Rocky Marciano Floyd Mayweather Barry McGuigan Bronco McKart Archie Moore  Erik Morales  ~Sugar~ Shane Mosley Carlos Navarro  Ken Norton Sean O'Grady Floyd Patterson Pedro Pena Aaron Pryor Ike ~Bazooka~ Quartey David Reid Sugar Ray Robinson Danny Romero Earnie Shavers Leon Spinks David Tua Fernando Vargas Pernell ~Sweet Pea~ Whitaker   Controls Controls in this game are good, though the flurries and combos could use a little work. There are times when your fighter throws a flurry, but is unable to follow it up with another punch, series of punches, or even get out of the way. At that juncture, you're vulnerable to attack. Then again, maybe that's how the developers wanted it. They could be teaching us not to rely on flurries until you have an opponent on the ropes. As a rule of thumb, just stick and move. Other than that, button-response is fairly accurate. When I want to deliver two consecutive jabs to the gut or avoid a string of punches, I usually have no trouble doing it.   While Knockout Kings 2000 has an array of punches and signature moves in its arsenal, it could do a better job teaching combos in the interactive training session. It would help to learn more complicated attack and defense strategies within the game as your fighter is building up his unblemished record... Well, there's always next year.  Graphics and Sound EA Sports has been known to drop the ball on the graphics side of things, but not here. Before each fight, we're given detailed fighter introductions. This includes the boxer walking toward the ring, with his theme song ringing in the background. Once both guys are introduced to the crowd by Jimmy Lennon, Jr., they exchange glares, walk over to the ref for instructions and touch gloves. It's even better than the real thing. You do have the option of pressing start to skip the entire pre-fight spiel, but it's definitely worth the extra few seconds.   The venues are well designed, from the meat-packing warehouse all the way to Caesar's Palace. Even the card-holding girls in between rounds look pretty real in their thong bikinis. Boxers have authentic faces, and unlike most sports titles for the PS, the crowd does not stick out like a sore thumb. Action is focused in and around the ring, so the spotlight is centered on the fighters. The crowd is enveloped by shadows and hardly seen, especially from the TV camera angle. That leads me to my next point -- various camera angles and instant replays give us a true-to-life presentation. You have the option of picking cameras, from ring to overhead to side, but the TV angle is probably the most realistic.   If you're a fan of hip-hop, you'll love the music in Knockout Kings 2000. Up-and-coming rapper ~O~ takes the reigns, putting together an original soundtrack, including each fighter's entrance theme. His track ~In the Game~ is featured in the opening montage and can also be heard during some training sequences. Other artists include Mix Master Mike, Nyt Owl and Simon Say's.   Finally, there's in-game commentary. You have the same announcing tandem from last year -- Al Albert and Sean O'Grady. They're often late to call important hits, and sometimes, they miss the call all together. This was a problem in the original, and while they've added more words to their repertoire, the end results are average at best. I personally enjoy listening to referee Mills Lane, who also makes his second franchise appearance. Lane actually worked with EA Sports to enhance the AI and was even motion-captured for the game's official. His virtual form spews the same verbal barrage on fighters as the real Mills Lane. ~Let's get it on!~In a way, it would be unfair to compare this game to the original Knockout Kings. Why? Because if that was the best-selling boxing game ever for the PS, I'm sure this one will surpass it in no time. Sure, it has a few minor holes in gameplay, but nothing's perfect -- not even the vivacious Catherine Zeta Jones, though she appears flawless every time I see her. There aren't too many new boxers in this year's lineup, but as long as Michael Grant's one of the new guys in the Heavyweight division, I'm happy. (For those who haven't seen Grant fight, he is the future of boxing.) These virtual boxers even look like their real-life counterparts. It's kinda scary. Like a good teacher, I don't want to be too magnanimous or lenient with my grades. I want to be fair yet reasonable. With that in mind, I must say that Knockout Kings 2000 is the best boxing game I've played for the PS, but it also has a long way to go. It's only the second year for this franchise, but keep in mind that it's made great strides. I can only imagine what's in store for 2001. Until then, I'll work on my left hook and body shots to get my created player to the Mecca of boxing. Go get it and see for yourself.", "date": "Nov 3, 1999"}
