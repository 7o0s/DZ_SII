{"name": "Darkstone", "name_review": "Darkstone", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/02/14/darkstone", "text": "Many games, since the release of Blizzard's ridiculously successful dungeon crawl, have been described as ~Diablo clones,~ Delphine's Darkstone among them, and I suppose, in some way, that's what they are.  Diablo is what started the renaissance of the last few years in randomly-generated dungeon-hack games, and it's Diablo's success that games like Darkstone are specifically trying to emulate.  What I dislike about the term ~Diablo clone,~ though, is that it seems to imply that Diablo was an original concept to begin with, and not a clone itself, which is a fraud on its face and very annoying to a fan of Nethack such as I.  Yes, Nethack, the most evolved descendant of Hack, Rogue, and the rest of the great tradition of multiplatform ASCII dungeon games, which have eaten such vast quantities of college mainframe CPU time over the years.  It's from these games, in turn, that Diablo descends.  Blizzard took the random dungeons, the heaps of items and monsters, and addictive hack-slash-and-hoard-treasure gameplay as the basis for their game.  Add nifty graphics and multiplayer components, and bingo, a million-seller.  Personally, I'd still rather play Nethack, and I have a similar opinion of Darkstone.  This is not a knock against Darkstone, exactly -- more the influence of my own peculiar taste in games -- because this is, honestly, a pretty decent port of a game that was very good on the PC to begin with.  It's hardly original, but it's certainly addictive, and even if you don't like it very much, you probably won't regret the loss of ten dollars for very long.  Gameplay  This is, as I said, Diablo (or Nethack or Rogue or whatever, but most of you probably recognize Diablo more easily).  You choose a character from four basic classes, each with a male or female variation, pick up a few odds and ends in town, and then head off into the wide world to seek your fortune.  There's a sort of overarching quest involving the evil dragon Draak and the shattered Time Orb (stop me if you've heard this one), but for the most part, your time will be occupied with a smaller scale of pursuits.  Head out into the field and kill things.  Go down into the dungeon and kill things.  Find stuff that enables you to kill things more effectively.  Head back to town every so often to buy more skills and spells and killing-stuff gear.  Et cetera.  Darkstone offers you plenty of different ways to kill stuff, though, and a wide variety of support skills and spells that make the business of killing more pleasant.  Any character can use skills and magic with the requisite attributes, and you can tune those up easily as you gain experience levels -- the basic spells are pretty weak, but further in you can pull off fun stuff like the Berserker upgrade and the Lycanthropy skill.  Special items are available in fairly ridiculous abundance, although I do wonder why giant wasps carry swords and gold pieces.  Quests are fairly simple, seeming to correspond to progressively larger slices of the game's dungeon, entrances to which are found in the ~lands,~ or outdoor areas, that radiate outward from the main town.  Exploring overland thus leads you to shortcuts deeper in the dungeon, although you have to brave increasingly dangerous opposition (f'n Amazons...) if you want to go that seemingly easier route.  If you head too deep in the dungeon too quickly, you're also liable to miss out on valuable quests.  Combat is as Diablo, with a lock-on feature and repeated presses of the X button replacing the PC's violent mouse-clicking.  The lock is fairly straightforward, always targeting the nearest enemy you face, but the automatic aiming of your attacks is reasonably smart, especially if you have a missile weapon, making combat no more difficult than something like Gauntlet.  Spells are mapped to the upper shoulder buttons, letting you have two ready to go at any time, and fiddling them around in the inventory screen isn't too difficult.  The same goes for re-ordering your items and equipment -- the menus and icon-based equipment system aren't all that pretty, but they get the job done.  Graphics  Darkstone's one claim to originality is its 3D presentation -- it's all polygons, as opposed to the 2D Diablo.  This has its downside, mainly a loss of graphical detail (the character and monster models are pretty primitive), but the rotatable camera and realtime lighting effects make it a pretty fair tradeoff.  The lighting in particular is very nice, with varying colors and intensities depending on what sort of light source you use (spells, torches, and so on) and good animating shadows.  It becomes clear, however, during moments of tension, that the PlayStation version is overtaxing its 3D engine.  Too many orcs and spiders dogging your heels will result in distinct episodes of framerate failure, especially if you've got some lighting effects going on in the same area, which is exactly what you don't want to happen when there's a horde of monsters bearing down on you.  There are also some frequent and rather bizarre errors that see enemies disappear and then reappear some short distance away, with no warning.  If these were teleporting wizards or djinn, I would be willing to go along with the phenomenon, but when ordinary goblins possess such abilities, I get a little suspicious.  Elsewhere in the realm of glitchdom, the load times are brutal, forcing you to wait around a minute in between areas that look almost exactly alike -- the random generation feature takes the time that reloading new textures doesn't, I suppose.  When you swap into a differently-themed dungeon level (they change every five or eight levels, give or take), expect an even longer wait.  Sound  One of the most vital pieces of advice offered by PC reviewers applies here as well: do NOT, under ANY circumstances, give money to the bard in the town square.  Horrible pain can be the only result.  The rest of the game's music, though, isn't that bad.  Dungeon and field exploration sequences have a surprising pleasant ambient soundtrack, light on melody but with a nice ebb and flow to it.  The sound effects and voices are a mixed bag, comparatively, depending on your taste.  Goofball that I am, I dig the dopey character voices, but they'll probably be nails on a blackboard to straighter sorts. Darkstone is ten bucks, and there's an awful lot of game here -- it's a far better deal than something like the shallow Ball Breakers or the unplayable Spec Ops.  Anybody who liked Diablo or anything else in the realm of dungeon-hack RPGs should be able to get their pocket-change's worth out of it.  Fans of traditional console RPGs are warned that they'll probably detest the presentation and near-lack of story, though.But even if ten bucks is cheap, free is even better, and Nethack is free for darn near every operating system ever devised by man -- as are Hack, Rogue, Adom, Omega, Moria, Angband, and God knows how many other ASCII roguelike games.  Give one of those a shot too, why don't you?  They may look simple, but you never have to worry about accidentally setting off the bard.", "date": "Feb 14, 2001"}
