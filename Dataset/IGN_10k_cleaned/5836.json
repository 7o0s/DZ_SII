You're enlisted as a one-man wrecking crew with some serious 80s-style machismo, sent forth into the 8-bit jungle to clear out the nasty rebel army Citizens Against Society -- perhaps one of the more goofy bad guy coalition names since ~Dragnet's~ PAGAN -- People Against Good and Normalcy.   The game is basically Metal Slug-lite. You run from left to right, unloading your boom-boom on a multitude of like-designed bad guys. When not blasting or platforming, you must rescue hostages for bonuses. You have both a gun and grenades, both of which have enough power to take out bad guys with relative ease. In fact, too much ease. The boys that summer at CAS training camps spent too much time making s'mores and not enough at tactical training. They run, then stand, then shoot. You can easily drop and blast them one at a time without too much concern for your health.   Max Trigger: Insurgence does offer multiple paths, which adds a minor bit of depth to a game that desperately needs it. Instead of always running on the main ground, you can jump on higher ledges or look for underground passages. You'll find extra health and ammo in these areas. Max Trigger: Insurgence also comes equipped with boss encounters.   We DL'd Max Trigger: Insurgence on a LG VX8000. The game's controls were fine -- fairly responsive, as is needed in this genre. Jumps are pretty easy to gauge. The game itself looked okay, with decently drawn sprites for all enemies, such as troops and tanks. Backgrounds are a little underwhelming. There is a looping wartime jingle to boost your adrenaline. Whether or not it was effective is open for debate -- but at least it was kinda catchy.   (Maybe it's just us, but the name ~Insurgence~ brings up a host of bad vibes that we'd rather not associate with entertainment. This isn't to say the phrase has been permanently hijacked, but there are certainly plenty of alternates that don't leave such an ugly taste in your mouth.)  Max Trigger: Insurgence is an average game to the core. It doesn't necessarily underachieve in any one category, but it sure doesn't inspire either. If you like Metal Slug-type actioners, Max Trigger: Insurgence might be a tempting download. However, I found it just too cookie-cutter and sorta, well, ~there.~ You know, it just sorta lays ~there.~ Pass.", "date": "Jun 21, 2005"}
