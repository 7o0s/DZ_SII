{"name": "Breakneck", "name_review": "Breakneck", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/07/20/breakneck", "text": "BMWs, Mercedes...both shining examples of German engineering.  Have a N.I.C.E. Day 2, or should I say Breakneck, hrmph..well.. it's not as sleek or aerodynamic, but it ain't too far down the totem pole either.  Oh well, SouthPeak's imports haven't come off looking so swell as of late (*cough* Blaze & Blade *cough*), so it's lucky for them that Breakneck's revved up to speed in time to salvage their good name.  Although Synetic's reality-be-damned racer comes in one box on one disc, it's actually two games in one.  Knuckleheads fiending for instant gratification will gravitate towards the Arcade mode, while the detail freaks'll live it up under the Expert settings. Confusing, eh?  Stay with me here.    Pure rally type action is the Arcade edition's claim to fame, since it ponies up traditional placement award and time trial competitions.  About the most complicated things get this way is deciding whether to use a sports car or monster truck.    Expert (career) mode opens up a whole new can of worms.  Here you'll be overwhelmed with sponsorship deals, race calendars, tire/engine/body upgrades, and a mile-high stack of options.  Flip-flopping setup screens, let alone styles of competition such as Fox Hunts or NRA-friendly Shoot-Outs, means having to wade through a mountain of menus so deep you'll need a road map to cruise past 'em.  A compartively heavy manual (50 oversize pages for a racing rehash?!) provides valuable insight into what's going on under the hood, though an interactive tutorial would have made a world of difference.  As it stands, hat's off to you if you can figure out how to work up a wad of cash within the first hour of shredding the plastic seal.  While it pretty much sucks that the design team went overboard on the interface, it's understandable considering how everything is adjustable according to custom specifications.  User-defined car models and paint jobs are where most titles pull the plug, but Breakneck lets you juggle advanced 3D card support functions, race conditions & parameters, display/backdrop quality, event schedules and the scope of championships.  An extensive upgrade system accounts for vehicle accoutrements like oil slicks, tire slashers, mortars, rocket launchers, turbo boosters, ultra-horsepower engines, suspension and braking. Those who can't fully appreciate this aspect of the game should try asking the local car dealer for personalized treatment and see how far it gets them.  Kudos to the government!  If Breakneck's any indication, lemon laws extend overseas. The driving model can be summed up in one word: fan-f'ing-tastic.  Bonzai class vehicles handle marvelously, but differently from say a classic auto, passenger bus, Formula 1 car or superkart.  Across the board this rule holds firm.  Half the fun comes from trying to keep these babies on the road, while the other half revolves around grinding an opponent into the wall or launching a projectile up their tushie.  Floaty moments in which you're sailing on the pavement surface now and again, though they can't fade the feeling of speed that permeates each and every bout.  Whipped up into a frenzy by the rhythm of a race, it's far-fetched to assume that anyone would notice the scenery blazing by.  Stomp on the pedal and you'll kick the frame rate into high gear, but flaws in the presentation show up clearly whether you're going 8 or 80 MPH.  Tree, brush, pyramid and structure sprites are perky and easy to spot, though they can't stand up to strict scrutiny.  An optical illusion causes 2D sideline objects to appear as if they were 3D models while your roadster is chugging along.  Hands down, the weirdest contrast is that while terrain elevation is present, several objects (trees, streams, etc.) don't cause a collision when bumped into.  And how could we forget Eddi, the friendly tip and insult slinging mechanic whose personality is an ungodly cross between Dennis Leary and George Costanza.  Surprise hits are always welcome around these parts - I'm the IGN sponsored Head Games & WizardWorks poster boy, you know [Editor's Note: except for the Extreme games that is...those are MINE!].  Straddling the fence between casual time killer and detailed simulation isn't a course of action that we'd recommend to fledling developers. Breakneck pulls it off, albeit just by the skin of its teeth.  Stick to the Arcade game for maximum thrills or be committed to spending hours sorting through menu screens to get to the good stuff.  Stumble into the gameplay one way or another and you'll wonder why an airbag wasn't included on the list of minimum requirements.  -- Scott Steinberg    Comment on this story", "date": "Jul 20, 2000"}
