{"name": "JAMDAT Sudoku", "name_review": "JAMDAT Sudoku", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/03/31/jamdat-sudoku", "text": "The puzzle phenom continues its invasion of the mobile scene with JAMDAT Sudoku from EA Mobile. (The JAMDAT brand will soon be sunsetted, just give it time.) Therer are already a few Sudoku games out for handsets, and admittedly, they all don't really differ from each other that much -- JAMDAT Sudoku included. EA Mobile's game uses the same official rules, a few difficulty levels, and the ability to ~import~ games from newspapers by planting seed numbers on a blank grid.   So, how does JAMDAT Sudoku differ? Well, for one thing, it's the ~cleanest~ of the Sudoku games, in my opinion. I really liked the zen approach of MFORMA's Sudoku Garden, but I think a lot of gamers will appreciate the stark white background on the JAMDAT title and the ability to choose the ink colors. You can go with green, red, blue, purple, etc. The number font in JAMDAT Sudoku is incredibly easy to read, too, which also makes it easier to look at a screen full of digits for an extended period of time.   JAMDAT Sudoku offers the option to track errors and see hints, which will really help beginners get the hang of the game. I know how to play Sudoku myself (Sudoku Garden taught me how), but I think the tutorial and hints included in this edition will also be just as effective in helping newcomers into fold.  JAMDAT Sudoku is a solid mobile Sudoku game. If you're into the puzzle, it's a good download. If you're curious about trying out sudoku, any of the mobile games -- JAMDAT Sudoku included -- are a nice place to start. Should you already have Sudoku on your handset, though, I don't see a reason to download another one.", "date": "Mar 31, 2006"}
