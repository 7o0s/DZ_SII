This top-down snowmobile racing game is a very clean, slick, and speedy production, but it lacks a certain flair in the frills department  frills that are somewhat needed in a racing game, especially to keep the replay value high. Features 10 courses Password save Rumble cartridge Link cable support Only for Game Boy Color  Polaris Snocross really is an impressive Game Boy Color product. The game takes a journey through three different difficulty Tournament cups and ten different courses in an overhead perspective. You race against two other computer opponents for first place  when you do, you move onto the next race, adding a notch to your vehicle  (top speed, acceleration, or traction). Go through all three cups and you're deemed the winner.  There are three different course designs, from a very bobsled-slope like track to a race through the wilderness, and the later levels throw in tons of jumps in the way  they may be fun to bump over, but they slow down your vehicle a lot.  Controls, animation, and sense of speed all stand out as excellent in Polaris Snocross. Like most top-down racers, you maneuver your vehicle by pushing left or right on the pad corresponding to clockwise or counterclockwise directions.  And even though you're on the snow, the tight controls never seem to be a problem  except when you find yourself wedged against a wall or tree. But even then, you can easily get yourself out of a jam.  Vehicles have been rendered at many different angles  not only do they look good and flow smoothly, the extra animation of the turning snowmobiles also adds to the tight controls. And when you get further into the game with the faster vehicles, you'll see a scrolling engine move so fast it'll make Sonic the Hedgehog do a double-take. And the programming for the two-player link mode is well-done, too. Granted, you'll only race the other player on the other Game Boy system (no computer opponent), but there's not a glitch to be found  it's like the other player's right there on the same system. Vicarious Visions makes it look so easy to provide link-cable support, so shame on other racing games for not implementing something similar.  While the game programming is extremely tight, there could have been a lot more. Nowhere is there a lap timer to record how fast you went through the course.  One thing the designers could have done was to record the top fastest laps for each of the courses to give players something more to shoot for. Also, the game could have benefitted from a map of the more complex courses, especially the ones that traverse the wilderness  the only way you're going to know which way to go is to blow a couple races to learn the layout of the land. And unless you've been keeping up with the other two racers, you'll never know what place you're in  nowhere does it tell you who's in first, second, or third during the race.  Finally, the game does only have one mode of play for single players, and only ten tracks, so the challenge is over pretty quickly.    After the lacking effort with Vigilante 8, Vicarious Visions redeems itself with a much better designed top-down racer. There could have been more to increase the replay value, but I had a good time playing it while the action lasted. If you enjoy racing games like RC Pro-Am or Micro Machines, Polaris Snocross is a decent, albeit short-lasting alternative.", "date": "Mar 3, 2000"}
