So, instead, Disney Internet Group came up with a quickie ship battle sim, light on the ~sim,~ with a little swordplay thrown in for good measure.  Features:  ~Based~ on the hit Disney summer flick Play as creepy-cool Jack Sparrow Ship battles and swordfighting  The concept behind the celly Pirates is that you must command a ship across the Caribbean seas, searching for map pieces. Of course, those maps aren't just bobbing along the blue in a bottle. They're kept in the holds of fierce fighting vessels, and in order to discover whether or not ~X~ truly marks the spot, you must clear out several sections of the seas.   Raging ship battles, complete with ramming and cannon fire? Sounds like fun.  Too bad it isn't. For one thing, Pirates is completely torpedoed by its lousy control. I understand that turning a full-scale ship isn't easy, but I can't imagine it being tougher than taking control of this pixel pirate pontoon. Use the keys on the numberber pad to slowly turn the ship - imagine the number pad is a ship's wheel, you have to rotate it to negotiate turns. Pressing ~2~ will straighten you out, while pressing ~4~ is a hard right. But you cannot keep pressing four to continue turning past that degree.  In order to fire your cannon, press ~5.~ You can only shoot a single cannonball at a time - never mind that a typical pirate ship was loaded to the gills with cannons, ready to send Imperial ships to the bottom of the drink. Aiming is a monster pain, you have to be right alongside of the other ships to get off a successful shot. At least the game is bright enough to automatically lob the ball on the side facing the ship.  The swordplay sequences work a little better. The control is still incredibly rudimentary -- as expected -- but not unweildy like the ship sequence.  There is little connection to the movie that spawned this game. No movie screens, no shots of the actors, no nothing. The visuals are merely passable, but much of the blame at this point can be laid at the handsets themselves. This current gen of cellphones is already starting to look tired, and it takes some serious innovation and commitment to get a solid, interesting game on them. (Sorrent comes to mind they manage to put the sweat into all their endeavors.)While not quite Hulk bad, Pirates manages to disappoint on many counts, from its lackluster game play to its unfortunate disconnect from the source material. If you are an abolute maniac for all things Pirates right now, feel free to put a few more bucks to your addiction. Just know that there aint no Jack Sparrow here.", "date": "Aug 18, 2003"}
