Humanity trembles before evil marauding creatures known as Boardriods. There is only one hope for the good people in the world, and that hope is professional snowboarders. Armed with baseball bats, 360 nose grabs, and the latest boarding gear from Burton, the World's top snowboarders vow to save the planet from evil (and maybe even score with a snow bunny or two). We're guessing the developers fell headfirst off their snowboards one too many times before cooking this one up because concept included, through and through Evolution Snowboarding is a craptacular game to behold.  The Facts    Save the World on a snowboard Pick up and wield nail studded bats, and chain whips Eight levels, each with 10 missions Punch, kick, and throw enemy snowboarders from the slopes Perform standard boarding tricks while kicking ass Fight bosses and join forces with real snow boarding legends Video clips of nu metal bands Collect name brand boarding gear in each level, and peruse the in-game catalog Two-player simultaneous play Requires two free memory blocks   Gameplay Evolution Snowboarding sports a game design, almost as jumbled and ludicrous as its storyline. Each level follows the same pattern; four missions are available from the start, and the remaining six are unlocked upon successful completion. Mission objectives are bland and repetitive. Objectives strictly adhere to the following categories: reach the goal within a specified time limit, collect x many items, do tricks for x many points, kill x many enemies, and defeat the level boss. Do not be fooled if it sounds like variety. The player basically has to punch, jump, run over shiny stuff, and occasionally use a boost to complete each and every mission.   Controls are sloppy and frustrating. If the player sees an interesting pipe to grind on, they will most likely find it difficult to sharply change course to connect with it. The character careens through the snow without the ability to sharply change direction. The lack of agility sucks the fun out of some potentially cool rails to slide on, and makes collecting certain items laborious. The player may also find his or her self falling out of the course enough times to make them want to put the controller down.  Fighting enemies is a button mashers wet dream. The creators of Evolution Snowboarding must have thought snowboarding had lost its edge as an extreme pastime and opted spice it up with mindless violence. Mindless is a very accurate description of how it feels to go up against the simple AI of the enemies.  One after another the Boardroids zero in on the main character without relenting, serving to annoy more than add any sense of danger. The AI of the enemies is so lame that the player could swing randomly to clear the level. There isn't much more to the level bosses either, save it takes a few more bat swings to destroy them.  A welcome addition to the game is a few multiple path areas and short cuts. Although the depth of these additions is pale in comparison to games like SSX it does add a little interest to the mostly bland tracks. As silly as the game's premise may sound, the mixed genre approach to snowboarding isn't its downfall (it worked with Road Rash). An attempt to tighten controls, refine the mindless fighting, and add more variety to mission tasks would make Evolution Snowboarding much more enjoyable. As it stands, though, the experience is a significantly flawed.  Graphics Some games will excel in graphics when they lack in gameplay, Evolution Snowboarding is not one of those games. Low polygon character models and ugly textures dominate this already tedious game. 10 missions per level do not enjoyably extend the game when the player tires of the environment after the third area. The framerate is usually solid but slowdown does creep into certain levels when four or more characters are on screen at once. It's hard to imagine why the fluidity would take a hit with near N64 quality character models. Beating down enemies might have been a little more interesting if they didn't explode in a cheesy smudge of pixels. Evolution Snowboarding was graphically outdated when it was released on the PS2, and it certainly does not take advantage of the power of the GameCube.  Sound Slipknot fans will surely appreciate the musical selection on Evolution Snowboarding. The game features about eight songs by bands in a similar heavy style. A cool addition of a music video theater is also well done for those Nu Metal fans, where they can watch videos from the likes of Killswitch Engage, 36 Crazyfists, Murderdolls, and of course Slipknot (to name a few). The choice of grinding guitar and scream driven music is fitting for the games post apocalyptic feel, but starts to sound monotonous very quickly. The in-game voices and cut scene voice acting (yes there is voice acting) are quite poor.   Evolution Snowboarding on GCN  The mechanized chicken cluck death screams of destroyed enemies are enough to educe a puzzled smile from the most jaded gamer. And if one is after bad game quotes, Evolution Snowboarding does the trick. One battle begins with the intimidating speech of a busty female boss: ~Why have you entered my mountainous region?~ The sound design of the game is neither good or terribly bad, it just does the job.From its wacky premise to its problematic gameplay, Evolution Snowboarding remains unimpressive. Although the game's combination of snowboarding and brutal violence probably appeals to a few gamers out there, I cannot recommend this incarnation. Instead, I would recommend deriving your own wacky videogame crossover, like full contact wheelchair racing, or martial arts mountain climbing.", "date": "Mar 19, 2003"}
