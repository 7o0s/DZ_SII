It's basically a platformer, but yet it encompasses most gameplay genres known to man. It's also great at points, but deeply flawed at others.   Haven: Call of the King is a story about a young lad named Haven, appropriately enough, who's out to find out a few things about himself, and save the world while he's at it. The evil overlord Vetch has enslaved Haven's people by infecting them with a virus. As the populous needs to be given a steady supply of antidote to stay alive, they're either forced to become Vetch's slaves, or perish. Haven has also been affected, and he still needs the antidote on a regular basis, but he's broken free of slavery and begins a journey to learn about some dreams that haunt him, and to possibly save the world.   While it's a platformer at its most basic points, Haven is ambitious in the fact that it attempts to brings multiple gameplay genres into the story and tie them together in a seamless fashion. Players take Haven over land, through the skies, into caverns and castles, deep into space, and more. Throughout these areas, the game brings with it bits of racing, flying, puzzle solving, shooting, and elements of just about every other action-based genre that you can think of.   Gameplay  Although Haven encompasses many gameplay genres, it's the game's platform elements that tie everything together. Most of the levels that you'll venture to have a series of goals that must be completed, much like most platform games. Many levels have a section where you'll need to collect four gears, five feathers, or perform some other standard platformer goal. The game works on a decent, if not overdone, level here, but where the game is best is when it strays from these basic collection elements and switches gears to a different genre.   The game includes a few races, which range from offroad vehicles to boats, some puzzle solving, some space action, rail shooting, and even some timed button pressing sequences are thrown in. The races are very arcade-like in nature, and if you've played a decent share of racing games before, they're pretty easy to beat. While nothing spectacular, the variety is what this game's all about, and it's quite welcome. A couple of the button pressing sequences seem a little gratuitous, though, and only seem to be there to add even more game genres. They're short-lived and simple, though, so even you DDR haters need not worry.   The best parts of the game are some of its puzzle sequences. One of the nicest areas of the game is the Egyptian themed area, and it's replete with puzzles. One section is a maze of sorts, where flat tiles cover a large gap between two ends of the room. Each tile has an arrow, and stepping on an arrow will drop all of the tiles in the direction that it's pointed. You have to work to the other side without dropping any tiles that you'll need to stand on later. It's quite a neat idea for a maze. Another section was over a pool, where you have to take out the four Guardians of the Pool, which are spider-like in nature, and somewhat resemble crabs. This area starts with a few floating platforms, and jumping on one will bring a few others around it to the surface, or sink any tiles around it that were already floating. The idea here is to basically play a game of timing and strategy against the Guardians in order to sink the tile they're standing on.   One minor complaint about nearly every goal is that it often doesn't make any sense why you're doing what you're doing. Sure, it makes sense that you need to go to a certain area, and maybe rescue a certain person, but some goals are of a much more specific nature, and the game doesn't explain why you would know to do that. For instance, you might have just entered a castle that you know nothing about, and the game will give you a couple goals like ~Go to the main ventilation area~ and ~Find five feathers.~ There never was an explanation of why you knew there was a main ventilation area, or what the feathers do once you happen to collect them. It would have made more sense to say something like ~Find the switch to open this large door in front of you,~ and then had you wonder up to the ventilation room to find the switch.    Not all of the goals that you need to complete in the game are great, though, and some are downright annoying. During one sequence where you're taking a boat on long journey to an island, you're attacked by a group of pirates. You'll have to man two separate gun turrets and take the pirates out. Their boats will fire some sort of missile or cannon from one section at a time, so you'll have to take out that section while being careful not to let too many of their attacks pass. You fight quite a number of boats, but the last ship is a good 15 or 20-minute battle. This entire sequence gets boring pretty quickly, so by the time you get to the last fight you'll just want it to end as soon as possible. Unfortunately, that last part will really test your patience.   There's another mission where you are looking for an island in a plane. In order to refill your fuel along the way, you need to take out a set of blimps. The blimps are protected by a series of SAM sites, which will shoot down intruders, and they also power the blimp's shield. So in order to take out a blimp, you'll have to take out its accompanying SAM sites as well. This sounds fine on paper, until you have to do the same thing six or seven times in a row, with practically no difference between them. To make matters worse, there are enemy planes buzzing around that will attempt to shoot you down. The problem with these is that they'll suicide dive into you, killing you instantly without any real way to avoid them. Luckily, what you've destroyed stays destroyed even if you die, and since you have unlimited lives, you just have to keep blowing stuff up until the mission finally ends.   The volcano level that you reach after this section pales in comparison to the Egyptian-themed level from earlier in the game. It's pretty much just running around collecting cogs, and the environment isn't nearly as finely stylized as some of the other areas, even if most of the game isn't exactly groundbreaking in its environmental originality. The less-than-impressive levels aren't exactly bad, per-se, but they don't match up to the level of quality of some of the others, and most of the goals have become completely repetitive by then.   The game's controls, like the levels and goals, are a mixed bag. Navigating Haven during the game's main platform areas is pretty easy and feels quite natural. He has a jump and double-jump which work well enough, but he sometimes has problems when trying to grab the edge of a platform. You might find yourself having to leap up at a ledge a few times before he'll grab on, and occasionally the game may cause a bit of frustration when he won't grab the edge of a platform that you just barely missed, and are then left to fall to your bottomless grave. One great thing about the controls, though, is they're easy to pick up for most of the game. Haven himself has a reasonable list of moves, but when you enter a race or pilot a plane, the controls are set up exactly like you'd expect them to be.   Haven's main weapon is his mag ball, which is basically a yo-yo that he'll sling at people to attack them. This doesn't work as well as it should, as it's hard to line up enemies for a nice shot. Sometimes you'll swear that the mag ball is going right through something without touching it, and it doesn't help that it's a close-range weapon, since a missed attack on an enemy usually leads to pain. Another problem is that Haven will usually take a step forward when attacking, so if you're too close and you miss an enemy that you easily should have hit, you might just end up running into it.   There's also a control problem when dealing with one of the barrel types in the game. Scattered throughout many areas are colored barrels. Hitting most of them will give you a charge to your mag ball, which then can be fired like a gun for a short period of time. There are blue barrels, though, which you can hop in to charge your shield, and optionally use them to launch out of to reach high platforms. Getting into these barrels can be a bit tricky, because you'll slide off the side if you don't land right in the center of it.    The game's camera is generally decent, but it has a few hiccups from time to time. The right analog stick pans the camera around, and it usually does a good job of tracking Haven on its own. It'll sometimes get stuck though, and you'll occasionally wind up in an area where you'll be unable to position the camera in a proper angle. There's a section or two of the game where you'll be doing a decent bit of platform jumping, and for some reason the camera will want to swing around in front of you, preventing you from seeing where you're going. These areas can be a little annoying, but they're not too difficult if they're taken slow and carefully. For the most part, though, the camera works fine and normally shouldn't present any problems.   A very nice feature of this game is that you'll only notice it load whenever you first start playing. After that, the game either streams the areas as you play, or it loads them during some quick transition scenes, which cover any signs of loading. As you move from one area to another, there might be a quick scene of Haven jumping aboard a train, which you'll then control him on, or similarly boarding a boat or some other transport, but the game will never stop to tell you it's loading. You'll also never see it pause to save. Once you select a saved game slot, the game will auto-save every time you complete a goal, and it does so while you continue to play. An icon appears on screen to let you know that it's saving, but you might not even notice sometimes. As you progress through the game, you never feel like you have to sit back and wait, other than to watch a quick cutscene or transition. The entire game is presented in a very seamless fashion, and it's pretty amazing once you realize that you've played through three or four levels without ever really stopping.   One problem with mixing many gameplay styles is that there's the risk of having some gamers get stuck on sections that they're not used to playing. For instance, if you're not really into racing games, then some random racing sections in other games may present a problem for you. The designers took this into account, and have designed the game so that the difficulty level will change depending on how you perform. For example, if you have problems on some of the shooter sections, the game will lessen the difficulty in order to let you pass that area easier.   Graphics  The graphics in Haven range from decent to great. For the most part, and upon first glance, the game has fairly standard quality graphics for a platformer. It has a pretty decent draw distance, nicely detailed towns that you'll sometimes travel to, plenty of trees and random scenery filler, and other things of this nature. There are a lot of little things that fill up the screen, and generally make things feel alive. Butterflies flutter about while outside, trees, grass and flowers sway in the wind, dust swirls around in some areas, along with many other tiny details that add to the liveliness of each scene. If you come across a wooden bridge, you'll notice the ropes that hold it up will move with the wind, and the bridge will teeter to the side if you stand near the edge.   Where the game stands out graphically is in its use of effects. Fire looks really nice in the game, but it also causes heat waves that blur your view of anything above it. There are some nice environmental effects, like rain, which will randomly poor down, but the day/night cycle and its effect on the surrounding area is awesome. Hues of pink and blue will highlight the horizon and bounce of the hills during dusk. When it turns to night, lanterns and torches will light up their surrounding area.   At points in the game, you'll be able to acquire a mirror shield pickup. When this happens, Haven turns transparent and he'll distort objects behind him. He's not exactly reflective like you'd expect a mirror shield to cause him to be, but the effect is excellent nonetheless. The particle effects are also very good. Various shots from your powered-up mag ball look pretty nice, as do enemies when they explode. The aforementioned swirling dust looks great also. There are a few places in the Egyptian themed area where scarabs will come scattering out of the floor, and the sheer number of them and the way they look as they swarm is pretty amazing.   The character animation is generally pretty good. Haven is a bit cartoonish in his run and overall style, but he also looks natural within the scope of the game's art direction. He has plenty of little motions and whatnot that keep him from ever really being motionless. When simply standing around, he'll almost immediately begin playing with his mag ball like a yo-yo. If the rain starts coming down, he'll put his hood up if you stop for a second. Likewise, he'll pull it back down when the rain stops. It's all these little things that make his character design what it is, rather than its overall look or style.    The small cutscenes that progress the story or tie together areas are nicely done for the most part. They aren't great, but it's stuff that works better than in most games. The voice acting is OK for the most part, and it works well to progress things, but the amount of character put into to the characters' facial movements is great. Lip synching is pretty dead-on for the most part, but it's the eye and eyebrow movements that really bring life to these scenes. That's not to say that they're always entirely realistic or natural looking, but it's pretty impressive and keeps things lively.   Sound  The game's sound effects are fairly decent, though they aren't groundbreaking by any means. There are plenty of environmental objects that cause numerous sounds throughout the levels, like steam vents or electrical currents, along with plenty of natural sounds like the rain or wind. As mentioned before the voice acting is OK and moves the story along reasonably well. It isn't great, but it gets the job done, and most of the characters aren't overly annoying.   The standout element among the game's sound is its music. Some of the musical tracks are just decent and aren't very memorable, but some areas contain bits of music that is near perfection. The Egyptian level and a few of the towns are perfect examples. If this soundtrack ever finds its way to a separate CD, I'll likely be picking it up.  Haven: Call of the King is quite an ambitious title. At certain points it's great, but at others it can be either frustrating or very boring. The game ties in most of the different genres in a pretty smooth manner. Nothing seems entirely out of place, and for the most part, it makes sense why you're playing the game in a certain way at any given point. Most of the racing sections are done well, and they play quite nice, even if it's about as basic as you can get.Some of the puzzle solving is where the game is best, though, and I think that's because the designers had their way with a little more freedom in design, rather than attempting to pop in things that most people would be accustomed to. It makes sense that they have to stick to design basics for most of the genres they hit, since otherwise the game would either be too disjointed or impossible to play for most people. But some sections, especially the rail shooting areas, are completely void of any excitement.Overall, though, the game is worth playing through. You'll have to tough it out through some aggravatingly boring sections, but when the game strays from the basics a bit, it can get to be quite fun.", "date": "Nov 19, 2002"}
