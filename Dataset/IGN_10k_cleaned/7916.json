One minute you're controlling Link in what appears to be the opening screens of The Legend of Zelda, only to be whisked away moments later to a jumping monkey or nose-picking challenge?  After its initial release it became apparent that not only did fans realize Nintendo just struck some of the most obscure, head-scratching gold the industry has seen, but the Big N realized it as well.  Since the original WarioWare back in 2003 there have been three additional titles featuring the loveable tyrant, with WarioWare Twisted! (again on GBA) being the definite favorite with its tilt functionality, though the series itself has evolved a bit from its original intent.  Since the DS ~Touched!~ compilation WarioWare has been looked at more as an introductory game, acting as a get-to-know-you game, introducing elements such as touch control, mic input, dual screens, or in this case, full motion control.     The concept of the WarioWare franchise is amazingly simplistic.  Players will start on an overworld map, choose an available mission, are treated to a intentionally tacky intro skit, and then are thrown into mini-game after mini-game.  For Smooth Moves, all the action centers around the Wii-mote, as you'll be using the controller in over 15 different positions to perform quick actions, finesse challenges, and all-around obscure tasks.  Each mini-game takes only a few seconds to either pass or fail, and should you fail four before getting to the epic ~Boss Battle~ section, Mr. Wario boots you out of the challenge.     You'd better listen to the man... What really makes WarioWare: Smooth Moves a great introductory title is the sheer amount of style that went into the game.  WarioWare games have always been known for their off-the-wall antics and astonishingly - but intentionally - cheesy art direction, and Smooth Moves takes it to a whole new level.  Skits are beautifully done (if that can be said about dancing clip art made up of unparalleled randomness), Miis are used around every corner, and while the game doesn't make use of a 16:9 display it is available for 480p, and the crisp look of Smooth Moves leaves the GameCube version in the dust.     If Mario Party is Nintendo's ~Gamer Olympics~, WarioWare: Smooth Moves is the Saturday night variety show, as players will find themselves having just as much fun watching intro/outro segments, playing multiplayer mini-games and full unlockable single player games as they will with the actual challenges.  Don't get us wrong though, as the new microgames are still definitely the start of the show.  Where Smooth Moves sets itself apart from previous versions - Touched! (DS) and Mega Party (GCN) specifically - is that this version wraps the games up in a more entertaining, stylized, and polished way.     But enough about the style, what matters most is the execution.  Since Smooth Moves takes the similar path as Touched! -  acting as an introductory game to a new system and new concepts - we were worried it would feel closed off from challenge to challenge.  In Touched!, players would do an entire challenge filled with only two-screen games or just touch tasks.  If an apple game up and you were in the touch challenge, you'd touch it.  The game was basically a no-brainer until the final mixes at the end of the game.  In Smooth Moves, the games offer far more variety not just in how you play them, but when they appear as well.  Every time a new action is introduced the game cuts away for a brief moment, goes into a melodramatic explanation (with voiceover reminiscent of the old ~Deep Thoughts~ skit on Saturday Night Live), and delivers a brief - but humorous - explanation of what this new pose is called, and how you'll use it.  Once that motion is learned, you'll never need to watch the explanation for it again, and it'll be added into the mix.  No character challenges making use of only one motion set, and because of it no gimmicky feel.      As for the microgames themselves, they aren't quite as solid of a compilation as Twisted was on GBA, but they're above both Touched! (DS) and Mega Party Game$ (GCN) as a whole.  Games include new updated versions of classic challenges such as a 3D nose-picking game, but also add in a ton of new tasks that can only be done with the Wii remote.  Players will use the controller in a ton of different ways, such as navigating a ball maze, beating unsuspecting bystanders with a stick (Why? We don't know), pulling tablecloths out from under glasses and plates, and bouncing a tennis ball with a virtual racket.     As always, 9-Volt's collection of tasks is our favorite, as his character features mini-games based entirely around classic Nintendo franchises.  In Smooth Moves this collection is as strong as ever, including tasks such as shaking hands with the Nintendogs cast, catching fish in Animal Crossing, knocking over barrels in Morph Ball mode in Metroid Prime, using the remote to control Mario as the referee from Punch Out (counting out Glass Joe is priceless), as well as playing through a three-level tilt-controlled version of the original Star Fox as one of the game's boss battles.  Legendary.     In fact, many of the game's boss fights are where we had the most fun, as they offer a ton of variety and make great use of the Wii's controller.  There's even a motion controlled sword fight that - while still a bit rough - gets the feeling of melee combat down using basic 1:1 Wii-mote tracking (Red Steel 2 please?).  As always the WarioWare franchise not only entertains and challenges us, but also shows off some inspiring technical ideas for future game designs.  Solid.   If Nintendogs for Wii looks this bad, Miyamoto is fired. That being said, Smooth Moves still has a few downsides that up the learning curve substantially.  For starters, the amount of motion control in the game is huge, so learning all of the intricacies of the Wii-mote can be a daunting task, especially for newcomers.  In addition, most of the tasks in the game will make use of the Wii's IR sensor, so while pushing a vacuum cleaner or controlling a virtual elephant snout seems easy enough it can be a hassle to have a mini-game failed because the Wii-mote wasn't technically pointing at the TV like it should have been.  Throw in the necessity of holding the controller on your head, in front of your face, or in other obscure ways and it can be easy to lose your bearing with the pointer if you aren't making a conscious effort to stay locked in place; something that's sure to kill newcomers more than a few times.     Along those same lines, some of the actions in the game are just a bit difficult to pull off or unclear in the game's intended action.  All this means is that you'll spend a bit more time doing trial and error with a few of the more peculiar mini-games, though the majority of the tasks are still petty intuitive and easy to perform.  The difficulty definitely doesn't kill the experience, but it is worth mentioning, as WarioWare: Smooth Moves is meant to be an inviting, mainstream game.  Since the release of WarioWare Touched! for Nintendo DS fans have seen the game go through a bit of a design evolution.  The franchise got its start on GBA as a fast, furious, and fearless mini-game challenge, and has since moved to being one of the expected titles released alongside a systems launch.  The guts of the game havent changed, as its still just as stylized, fast-paced, and intense as it always has been, but amidst WarioWares roots lies a package designed for newcomers to the Wii, and for players eager to see exactly what the system can do.  We saw it in Touched!, and were seeing it again in Smooth Moves.  The game may be a bit on the short side, taking most gamers around three hours to rip through initially, but its packed with a ton of entertaining challenges and crisp, clean, animated shorts.  Smooth Moves is as much about the experience as it is about the game, though in the midst of a fun-loving atmosphere it still manages to give hardcore gamers a challenge, loyal Nintendo fans a dose of nostalgia, and newcomers a chance to see what it is Nintendo is all about this generation.  Its not perfect, it isnt the best in the series, but WarioWare: Smooth Moves is an essential piece of the Wii collection, as its as much fun ripping through it in single player adventures as it is to shove the controller off on unsuspecting houseguests or non-gamers months and years down the road.", "date": "Jan 13, 2007"}
