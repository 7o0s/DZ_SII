For NCAA March Madness 06 the development team at EA has thrown in some features that are making this feel like a true college basketball game and not a stripped down NBA Live. But several years into the experiment, we're seeing considerable progress in MM capturing the spirit of college basketball. The ebb and flow of emotion, intensity and composure is something rarely seen in the NBA outside of the playoffs. In college hoops it's what motivates 6,000 students to go out on a snowy night and gather in smelly little gyms where they played volleyball earlier that day to watch a team with a 5-12 record go to battle like they're playing for a championship.    To capture this, March Madness introduces the Lockdown Stick and Senior Leadership for the 06 edition. The Lockdown Stick lets you tighten up on your defense and play a ballhandler so close you can smell the flavor of his chewing gum, as Gene Hackman said in Hoosiers. Being able to D-up on the other team's point guard let's you slow the game down, force the action to one side of the court or the other and, when guarding a player without the ball, pressure them into starting their offense further from the basket. These are all little things coaches are trying to teach their players in preseason practices right now. In MM06 you simply move your player close to the ballhandler and pull down on the right analog stick. You'll get an icon under your feet to indicate you're locking him down but really it's sold by the animation that shows your guy bodying up on his man. It becomes a game within a game as the ballhandler tries to get around you by zigzagging his way up the court and you have to keep your man close to him while maintaining the lockdown on the right analog stick. Going for the steal feels good on the shoulder button/triggers as does executing a full or half court trap with one of your teammates. The Lockdown Stick and all of the associated functions that come with it work very well and it's a college basketball-specific innovation that shouldn't be overlooked.    There are varying levels of talent in college hoops and so what the players lack in ability they often make up for with heart and determination. This is how you get so many corn-fed Big XII behemoths on All-American lists but so few in the NBA. Big Country Reeves anybody? But player who somehow turn it on in the middle of a game and show ability where before there was none is what college ball and the new Senior Leadership feature is all about. Each team has a senior-most member who can fire up his teammates and inspire them to play above themselves in key moments. It's kind of a combination impact player and team chemistry feature that can turn the tide of a close game. John Wallace carrying Syracuse to the finals in '96 or Tyus Edney taking UCLA's title hopes coast to coast the year before are the inspiration for this system and it works well. Your senior leader doesn't have to be a senior necessarily but he's the one who will be blocking shots (which feels better in this game than it does in NBA Live 06), getting steals, hitting runners, three-pointers and hook-shots like he's in the zone once you've got him heated up. His passes will be more accurate now that his teammates will be cutting to the basket with a sense of urgency. The system could've easily degenerated into cheesiness but he's not entirely unstoppable and the effects don't last forever. The senior leader's ability will be more reliable than going to an impact player in NCAA Football, put it that way.    The Dynasty mode is still robust and easily accessible. The main new feature here is the gameplan mode which lets you spend points to learn a bunch of information about an upcoming opponent. You're graded on the accuracy of your scouting report but we'd prefer some more insightful information. I don't  need to know Duke's SG#4 (JJ Redick) is an amazing All-American. I need to know what to do stop him; what's worked in the past, what other teams have done against him. That's a scouting report.    Many of the same gameplay problems that plague NBA Live 06 pop up in March Madness 06. We said steals and blocks definitely feel better in MM06 and not as ~phantom-like~ due to shoddy collision, but there are still those inexplicable behind the basket layup attempts and horrible out of bounds/backcourt calls. Hitting a shoot button as you charge down the lane, even if you're a little close to the basket should never carry you behind the backboard, let alone force you take a shot from back there. Doctor J and Larry Bird did it, but they're superhuman. In a basketball videogame, pressing the shoot button should always take a shot from the inbounds side of the backboard. Call us crazy. Sure it can cause animation skips where players auto-zip to the appropriate location to get a shot off, but it's not like EA Canada has gotten rid of this anyway. If you steal a sideline inbounds pass, try not to do it while straddling the halfcourt line because the CPU will process that as a backcourt violation. Even a bad high school referee knows you have to establish three points of possession (two feet and the ball) in the front court before the invisible iron curtain of a possible backcourt violation comes up. March Madness 06 sometimes does not.     Graphics   The new animation sequences for the Lockdown Stick feature lead the way of graphical improvements. Finally being able to seriously ~D~ up a ballhandler is sold so well because you see the player pressed up against the offensive player with his feet planted wide and his arms outstretched. When the duo start moving back and forth across the court, you see the risk/reward of this tactic playing out. The ballhandler looks like he can roll off of the defender at any second if the defender doesn't keep his feet moving and his center of gravity low. Hours of defensive shuffles in practice seem to have paid for players in March Madness and the developers at EA Canada.    With 300+ teams in the game it's certainly difficult to make every arena unique, but it seems like after Cameron Indoor Stadium, the efforts to customize the gyms of smaller schools just stopped. Some schools play in high school-sized buildings but this doesn't mean you can't have the randomness and even inconsistencies of smaller arenas. Fans standing too close to the court and more differentiation in the cheering section (boosters vs student section) would help March Madness differentiate itself from EA's NBA Live franchise.   The player faces look decent even though we're talking about thousands of players who cannot really look like they're real life counterparts anyway. After especially rough fouls or big baskets at crucial moments, the cutscenes really show off the emotion of otherwise anonymous basketball giants.   Sound   The crowd noise is very well done and adds a tremendous amount of authenticity to March Madness. Even on crappy television speakers, you can hear as the crowd gets progressively louder and quieter by degrees. Pumping up the crowd on defense will make them louder, but keep it up and they'll get louder. If you make a big play after this, in response to their wild cheers guess what? They get even louder. The team at EA Canada has nailed the dynamic volume of a hoop environment splendidly. We thought it was good in FIFA06 with the chanting and what not, but it's translated very well to an simulated ~indoor~ environment.     Dick Vitale and Brad Nessler call the action and a few new lines of commentary here and there can't make up for the fact that you'll have them repeating themselves soon enough. Even when Vitale gives good advice on what you should do (call a timeout, etc.), if you keep ignoring, you'd think there'd be some reaction to your hardheadedness. How great would it be if Dicky V kept going at you and calling you names for your unorthodox, bullheaded hoop strategies? The digital Vitale would be a better announcer than the overly-enthusiastic real one, that's what.   This year's March Madness is better than last year's effort and the franchise is definitely moving in the right direction where it's truly a college basketball title and not a re-skinned, stripped down NBA title. The Lockdown Stick is a feature that doesn't seem like a big deal at first, but adds whole new dimension of authenticity to the game, especially when playing head to head. Nobody plays defense in the NBA so you wouldn't need a Lockdown Stick in Live, but that and the Senior Leadership feature make this more of a college hoops game than it has been in the past. Even with the same shortcoming as it's pro hoops big brother, MM06 is worth a look for diehard fans of college sports.", "date": "Oct 18, 2005"}
