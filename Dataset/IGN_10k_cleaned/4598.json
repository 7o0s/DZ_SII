Playing this makes you wonder what the big deal was about. Toshinden has some true 3D moves, and the magic and fantasy elemnst of the game will appeal to some players, but the depth of the game is no where no that of Virtua Fighter 2 or Fighting Vipers.That said, this is an OK game, and it's fun to play just to spite PlayStation owners who said it couldn't be done, but unless you must have every 3D fighter out there, or you're somehow brain damaged and don't like Virtua Fighter, there is really no compelling reason to own this. In the end, like most PlayStation exclusive software, this is all flash and no depth.", "date": "Nov 15, 1996"}
