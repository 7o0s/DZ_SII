These guys are legends in the Japanese RPG scene, and their resumes sparkle like pure gold. From Uematsu's work on the soundtracks for Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VII, Toriyama's character and monster designs for Dragon Quest VIII (not to mention Dragon Ball Z), and Sakaguchi's untouchable status as creator of the Final Fantasy series, you would think that combining their superpowers could not only crank out a killer RPG, but solve global warming, end the war on terror and even successfully launch another 3DO console.   Yet, it's hard to find these great masters' fingerprints on Blue Dragon. Either they sat around and blew the budget on beer and noodles, or they're at the point in their careers where they've just lost touch. Sting recording R&B dross with Craig David springs to mind.   Punch Giant Robo!  Okay, it's not all doom and gloom. It could be that Blue Dragon is an RPG aimed firmly at young kids and casual gaming newbies. It has a generic accessibility, combined with a tried and true old-school RPG formula and anime cartoon appeal. What bothers us is that it just doesn't have any meat on its bones for gamers who burn through more detailed and complex games such as Final Fantasy XII. There's just nothing here to get excited about.   Off the bat, Blue Dragon won't fail to impress you with its gorgeous, polished visuals. The elaborate cutscenes have the glossy sheen of an expensive animated feature film, and the characters all look good and move beautifully. But the attraction is very much on a surface level. The actual designs of the characters are generally bland and unmemorable. Many of the large, open locations have very little going on in them except for obviously placed treasure chests and wandering monsters.   Basically, Blue Dragon has a decided lack of atmosphere, and its ho-hum story does little to make up for it. Even after your first twenty hours (the game comes on three discs), when you should be deeply engaged in the adventure, you'll be falling asleep at the controls. That's if the annoyingly bratty voice actors don't wake you out of your fine slumber.   Combat in Blue Dragon is very similar to the earlier Final Fantasy games. Your party's attacks are queued up in a turn-based system, allowing you to sit back and contemplate your next move before launching a physical attack, casting a spell or using an item. The Final Fantasy comparisons even stretch as far as the actual items you acquire, such as resurrecting a fallen foe with a ~Phoenix Talon~ instead of a Phoenix Down. Is this laziness or a lack of imagination? More likely, it's just so gamers can get to grips with the game without having to trawl through an item list, but it still rankles.   Whoops, this gameplay screen must have slipped into the press kit by mistake!  Likewise, there's a class and skill set-up that's not too far removed from Final Fantasy's Jobs system. For instance, you can set characters to focus on Black (offensive) magic or White (healing) magic, make them a Monk to improve their physical attacks, or play them as an Assassin so they can steal items from the enemy and perform surprise attacks, and so on. It's nothing really new, but it's a good system that allows you to configure your small party exactly how you want it.   The only real difference in Blue Dragon is that it's not really the characters that you're equipping with skills, but their shadows. The three main characters, Shu, Kluke and Jiro swallow mysterious light spheres and their shadows transform into giant guardians. Shu acquires the titular Blue Dragon, Kluke gains a Phoenix and Jiro a muscle-bound bull. You'll also pick up other characters along the way with this ability, from the annoyingly tantrum-prone MaruMaro and his tiger shadow, to the sexy mercenary Zola and her vampire bat.    Blue Dragon tries to offer something different by incorporating a couple of different elements into combat initiation and the turn system. Because you can see where wandering monsters are on the world map, the game allows you to draw more than one creature into combat by ensuring they're within a certain radius of your party. If the monsters are natural enemies, it will trigger a fight between them, making your job a tad easier.    So many captioning options... it's hard to know which way to go. I think I'll run with... bestiality.  Characters' attacks can be made more effective if you charge them up, although this pushes your turn back in the combat queue. The benefits are in critical attacks and spells draining less mana, although against certain monsters you'll be reluctant to leave yourself vulnerable for any longer than you need to. It makes the battles a tad more interesting, but it's only a subtle twist on what is a very tried and true combat system. Other than the monster designs, such as the awesome Poo Snakes, there's really nothing here you haven't played many times before.   As you wander about Blue Dragon's expansive landscape, you'll begin to wonder if the entire game is going to be about examining tree stumps and small rocks for money. That's because even the most innocuous objects in the game seem to spew forth cash and items. This gives you the bug to start ~clicking~ on everything you see in case you find some useful stuff, which really bogs the exploration down. Instead of marvelling at the environment or engaging interesting NPCs, you'll be checking the flowerpots and signposts for money. But hey, you're not really missing much, because most of the dialogue from NPCs in the game is depressingly predictable. There are virtually no sub-plots to unravel or pursue through chatting to villagers, whilst trading becomes a mechanical process of grabbing the next tier of stat boosting accessories as soon as cash permits.  Blue Dragon is hardly Microsofts answer to Final Fantasy. Its a decent game and one that certainly fills a gap in the 360 software library, but its not the RPG that you would expect from such an experienced team. Hopefully, Mistwalkers next Xbox 360 RPG, Lost Odyssey, will offer an experience thats a lot more innovative, imaginative and original.", "date": "Aug 26, 2007"}
