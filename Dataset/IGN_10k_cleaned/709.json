Though series founder Namco Entertainment is not the developer behind the 64-bit title, it really doesn't matter as newcomer NST (Nintendo Software Technology Corporation) has worked overtime to deliver one hell of an impressive take on the brand complete with an overwhelming sense of speed and incalculable polish. Nintendo 64 owners, this is the racing game you've been waiting for.  The Facts  ~Nine tracks~ (three tracks with three variations each) 25 cars Classic and improved RR driving formula equipped with powerslides Four different gameplay modes Multiple drift modes Four-player support Save to cartridge   Gameplay The Ridge Racer franchise is known for serving up a perfect blend of speedy pick-up-and-play mechanics and a skill-driven powersliding system. Developer NST (Nintendo of America's internal studios) has not strayed from the winning formula. RR64 is all about speed, ease of play, and of course, powersliding -- all taken to the next level.  The game features options to race with title-specific drift and collision detection sets. So, if you liked the way Revolution played, you can select to race in RR64 with the exact same drift and collision detection style and believe us when we tell you that no details have been spared. Even better, NST has also designed its own unique drift and collision detection system that is employed as the standard -- and wow, is it polished. Not only does it improve upon the bouncy feeling of past RR titles, but it enables racers to pull off thrilling 360 powerslides that actually work to harness more speed when executed correctly. This addition alone is enough to change the way you think RR64. It's a huge extra that'll have your friends asking, ~How in the hell did you do that?~   This game is blazing fast from the beginning on. RR64 has a decidedly arcade feel about it that enables players to jump right into it. While there are only four vehicles unlocked (out of a possible 25) to start with, they are already pretty zippy and cars only get faster from there. There is no tedious slow period that forces gamers to squeak by the first-wave of slow-moving turtles in order to acquire better vehicles later on. The cars are so fast that you want to pull back on the analog stick to make them fly. And once you've battled through the fist nine tracks and are a half-dozen vehicles through the game, the sensation of speed jumps to F-Zero X levels.   Control, which varies from vehicle to vehicle, is generally very tight. It's easy to round a soft corner and a few taps of the B button will execute a worthy powerslide that'll handle just about any sharp turn presented without any problems. And once your skill level rises, you'll be able to dazzle buddies with 360 spins to your heart's delight. You'll find yourself devising new ways to 360 powerslides past opponents and yes, you'll actually need to use it once you've advanced far enough.  Our biggest complaint is not a surprising one. Though Nintendo would love nothing more than boast that RR64 features nine unique courses, the fact of the matter is that there are really only three -- two from previous RR games and one original. Sure, there are three significant variations for each track (which is how we get that marketable 'nine' figure), and there are reverse courses to deal with after you've beaten the primary game, but even with all of that RR64 fails to deliver the amount of track variety that other racers do. We've had the game for three days and we're done. We've gone all the way through it. We've raced all the courses and we've acquired all the cars. The truth is, dedicated racers will probably be able to zip through RR64 in a day or two. Of course, the same could be said for Ridge Racer and Revolution for PlayStation, but that hasn't stopped either game from gaining classic status.   The truth is that the game is so fast, so polished and so much fun that you'll come back to it time and again even after you've beaten all the tracks and obtained all the cars. You'll come back to show your friends how you can take a sharp corner at 150mph with a speedy 360 powerslide. You'll plug in a few extra controllers and marvel at the framerate and play consistency. You'll master the tight controls and you'll take on the Time Attack mode to beat high scores previously set by yourself. And you'll love every minute of it.  Multiplayer Up to four players can go head-to-head in a split-screen race in RR64. The two-player mode is spot-on with the single-player, delivering a brilliant framerate with drones on-screen, only slightly reduced detail and even options for different screen views. The three- and four-player modes are a notch lower on the playability scale thanks to a noticeably more sluggish framerate, but it's still never too bad and it's certainly never unplayable. The only gripe we have is that in three- and four-player mode, the engine noises are dropped out while the music continues to play.   Graphics Let us just borrow a phrase Keanu Reeves made popular and say, ~Whoa.~ That sums up the look of Ridge Racer 64. Perhaps the most amazing thing about this game is its blistering fast framerate, only upped in performance by F-Zero X on Nintendo 64 -- really. You won't believe your eyes as this game roars along with a smooth fluidity with a pretty environment scaling by, three polygonal cars up front and two in your rear view mirror. This game has virtually no framerate issues excluding minor slow-down in the replay mode with multiple cars displayed on-screen.  It seems NST has ensured a quality framerate above all else by making sacrifices in the overall polygon count of vehicles and environments. As a result, cars appear a bit on the blocky side (while they look spectacular in the selection screens) and environments, while beautiful, are still decidedly edgy. Also, for some odd reason, vehicles have this shaky, jittery, PlayStation-esque appearance in third-person mode that takes some getting used to. Texture design, obviously not in high-resolution mode (NST was going to use the 4BM Expansion Pak for an optional 640x480 mode, but decided against it as the standard resolution looked nearly as good), is slightly grainy in areas, but never bad. In fact, everything generally looks stunning, with added polish from motion blurs on headlights and taillights to dazzling reflections and pre-sourced shadows and lighting effects. In the end, we've got a game that looks spectacular and runs with a framerate only bettered by F-Zero X. Hats off NST. Brilliant work.  Sound An opening intro shows a compilation of racing footage complete with vrooms and skids accompanied by a booming techno soundtrack in full stereo sound -- and it's the perfect indication of things to come. The soundtrack, composed entirely by an outside source, is all techno all the time and it's actually very well done (not quite Neil Voss caliber, mind you, but not bad all the same). Otherwise, we've got loads of engine noise, crash bangs, and occasional commentary like, ~It's a new lap record!~ You know, the standard RR mix. Overall, it all works well, though a full surround sound mode would have been nice. Also, we're a bit baffled by NST's decision to push music over sound effects in the three- and four-player modes. Having played all the way through Ridge Racer 64, I can recommend it as the most polished racer on Nintendo 64. This game really has it all: an undeniable, incomparable sense of lightning fast speed; 25 cars (which are acquired through a fun dueling system); a top two-player mode and a decent four-player one; the classic RR drifts plus an amazing new one that enables full 360 spins and more! It's got an amazing framerate that never hitches and an overall clean, tweaked feel and look as well.  The only problem I've got is that with only three main tracks (including major variations of each and reverse courses too), the overall experience is decidedly short -- so short, in fact, that dedicated racers will probably be able to zip through it in a day or two. However, RR64 is no shorter than Ridge Racer or Revolution for PlayStation, and we all love those games, so...If you're an arcade racing fan, you'd be an idiot not to run out right now and slap down the $50 for Ridge Racer 64. But if you're a simulation junkie expecting weeks and weeks of extended customization options and gameplay, this isn't the game you're looking for.NST has firmly established itself in my mind as one of the top developers in the industry and I simply cannot wait to see what it's got planned for Dolphin. Amazing work guys.", "date": "Feb 15, 2000"}
