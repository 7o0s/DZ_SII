It was 1994, and Nintendo's second home console had been on the market for three years. Three years marked by competition, heated rivalries against opposing companies on a scale that the Big N had never experienced before. Nintendo needed a hit. With its audience drained first by SEGA's Genesis and, then, by Sony's brand-new PlayStation, Nintendo needed a blockbuster game to grab gamers' attention again. Donkey Kong Country was it. Donkey Kong Country saved the system.   It was the graphics. Like nothing gamers in 1994 had ever seen before, Donkey Kong Country's visuals were spectacular. Rendered 3D models, detailed character animations, lush backgrounds and a verdant jungle setting were what it was all about. If you were around and gaming in '94, you know -- DKC blew everyone away, and it did it on a 16-bit system.   The game went on to revitalize sales of the 16-bit Super Nintendo, extending its life cycle by reactivating thousands of lapsed fans and creating a new install base of thousands more. With so many players fondly remembering it in the past, it's understandable that Donkey Kong Country has been one of the most-wanted games for the Wii's Virtual Console. And now, it's here.           The game is still a barrel of fun. As Donkey Kong, you set out on a side-scrolling adventure across the tropical DK Island to recover your stolen hoard of bananas from the villainous King K. Rool. But you're not alone  -- your simian sidekick Diddy Kong tags along for tag-team action. You control one character at a time, the inactive ape following behind, and each has his own unique strengths. Donkey Kong is stronger and heavier, giving him the power to take out bigger baddies with a single bounce. Diddy is faster, more mobile. His cartwheels spin him along the ground and can roll through multiple enemies at the same time.   The two heroes also take a page out of Mario's Yoshi-riding book by finding rideable animal friends along the way. Rambi the Rhino, Winky the Frog, Enguarde the Swordfish and more can be saddled up in several of the game's levels, and you'll often need them and their unique skills to access hidden bonus rooms. Secret rooms are one of the core elements of Donkey Kong Country -- finding the hidden doors and blast barrels that serve as entrances to the secret chambers is the key to maximizing your completion percentage.   And you'll want to make that percentage climb as high as you can, because doing so means seeing more of the game. More of the environments, more of the characters. You'll want to see more, even though Donkey Kong Country's graphics aren't as explosive today.    It's been the folly of many video games to focus too much on their visuals, sacrificing gameplay for the sake of a short-run attention grab and quick impulse sales. Donkey Kong Country has been accused of exactly that in the past, even by such legends as Shigeru Miyamoto, who's claimed that the DKC series is proof that American gamers will buy anything so long as it just looks pretty. But Shiggy's being a bit too harsh on the game there. The truth is that, yes, Donkey Kong Country isn't as deep or polished as some of Miyamoto's own gameplay designs. But it's still a great play experience. It's still a unique and fun take on the character of Kong, fleshed out with lots of fun supporting characters, an outstanding overall presentation and a soundtrack that's of such remarkable quality that it was released on its own standalone CD.Donkey Kong Country is a solid addition to anyone's collection and it has been revisited a handful of times over the years. Its visual style and gameplay design were first adapted to the Game Boy as Donkey Kong Land in 1995, and then the original game itself was ported to the Game Boy Color in 2000. In 2003, it went portable again, ported to the Game Boy Advance before finally hitting the Virtual Console in 2007. Keep in mind, though, that some of your nostalgic feelings may take a hit, as its revolutionary-in-1994 visuals aren't as spectacular any more, now in 2007. But DKC's gameplay is still a lot of fun, and it's still easy to see why this was the game that saved the Super NES.", "date": "Feb 20, 2007"}
