Essentially a Diablo clone in 3D, the game has all the aspects that made Blizzard's two games entertaining. You get five character classes to choose from, each with three skill trees and lots of varying abilities. There are plenty of items to collect, including special rare ones. Encounters with gigantic bosses are in place, there's a good camera system that lets you keep the action in view. Despite all that, we were generally bored with the experience.   The playable cast of Janos the Dwarf, Tal the Elf, Kithana the Nightblade, Sarus the Draconum, or Chela the Amazon, are all Oathsworn. They've pledged allegiance to a Solonavi named Sylvathis who eventually charges them with the task of recovering five Aspects of Apocalypse scattered around the world. Getting all five in one place will foil the Landshatter Prophecies whereby a giant Landshatter Dragon breaks apart the Earth with the help of an evil power-crazed magician called Katalkus.    To get to each Aspect, you'll need to kill a whole lot of baddies. Each dungeon map in the game has an very linear layout. Moving from start to finish will require the slaying of all the enemies standing around, which are all apparently waiting for you. Occasionally there are extremely light puzzle elements, like the energy spire power-downs near the start and end of the game, or the switches when recovering an Atlantean Skiff. Instead of giving you experience for kills, actions level up a character's individual statistics. For instance, using a lot of magic spells seemed to give us more Wisdom (more mana) and Intelligence (faster mana regen). Entering melee combat will instead level up Strength (stronger attacks) and Stamina (more health).   Skills function in somewhat the same way. As each is used, it accumulates individual experience. Eventually it levels up. Depending on what your statistics are, a new skill in one of three trees may be unlocked. By mousing over the icons of still-locked skills you can see what you need to do to make them available. During one single-player playthrough we were able to reach the end of only one skill tree. This means there's plenty of room to further expand your character's abilities by either playing through the single-player campaign again or going online and playing cooperatively.   Sounds pretty good, right? Unfortunately the rest of Mage Knight doesn't manage to remain interesting enough to warrant more playthroughs. To begin, the storyline isn't executed very well. The frequent cut scenes never deliver any kind of engaging dialogue and are further hampered by voice acting that sways from average to terrible. Chela the Amazon, for instance, sounds like she's reading a lecture for an English as a foreign language class. Janos isn't much better. Kithana, on the other hand, has a natural flow to her speech, but amongst such awful co-stars it doesn't really matter. While the storyline could have been passably interesting, poorly structured dialogue and bad voice acting prevent it from excelling.    Regardless of which character you picked to start the game, they'll all end up in the party by the end. Though you'll be the only one directly controllable, there are some limited party control commands like attack, follow, and stop. You'll quickly come to realize how useless these commands are. Party members in this game get lost constantly. Over the course of a stage, your squad will get split up or stuck behind a wall, a pillar, or their own clumsy feet, leaving you to fight alone. We tried on numerous occasions to go back and retrieve our allies to little effect. Many times, even as we were standing directly with no obstacles between us and slamming the follow button, they wouldn't budge.   As a more roundabout solution, if you can get your allies killed they can be revived at any of the game's numerous save points. When you die you'll also automatically respawn at the save point. This initially proves to be convenient but later reveals itself as a device that removes nearly all the challenge from the game. Let's say you're at a boss encounter or a fight with a particularly nasty group of monsters. They kill you. You respawn at a nearby save point with any squadmates that happened to go down and all your armor, weapons, and statistics intact, then run back to the conflict. As it turns out, absolutely nothing has been reset, so you just continue the fight. Rinse and repeat until you win. Another strange design element is that bosses seem to regenerate their health extremely slowly, so death is in no way detrimental to your battle. Just run back to them after you die, then keep hammering away. Only on the end boss (who has a super-cheap instant-kill blast) did we have an issue with this, since he regenerated rather quickly. By drawing him near a save point, we solved the problem.     Another feature that drains challenge from the game is incredibly overpowered character abilities. Combining Kithana's Mindreave and Miasma skills (channeled spells that restore mana and health, respectively) renders her pretty much invincible. It doesn't help that magical abilities can be shot through obstacles, meaning casters can eliminate enemies allegedly protected by doors or rocky walls. Though it was infrequent, some groups of enemies wouldn't react to getting hit, content to getting pelted by spells and swords until they went down.   Between each of the six dungeon areas (except the last) are towns which are extremely limited in terms of who you can interact with and can be returned to through a convenient warp feature activated by clicking on a save point. Unfortunately warping out of town to sell off excess inventory respawns all the monsters in a dungeon. It doesn't help that your backpack is far too small to accommodate everything worth picking up, so you'll be warping back pretty frequently if you want to buff up your bank account. Incidentally, it's incredibly easy to make money in Mage Knight. Seemingly ordinary pieces of armor and accessories found in the field sell for gigantic sums, meaning anything available at a vendor will be more than affordable after a few inventory unloads.    On the positive side, Mage Knight gives players some cool customization options, even if we've seen them before. Weapons and armor can be fitted with magestones, which serve as damage or resistance bonuses based on what color elemental combinations are entered. The stones drop pretty frequently off of named characters, so they're never in short supply. Having three of the same quality can, like in Diablo, be squashed together through a Forge menu to create one higher level gem. You'll even have the ability to remove them once set. There's also an extensive potion creation system where players learn recipes and mash together herbs all over the world.   In terms of replay there are a bunch of options. You can head back to any completed area and beat up monsters there. The single player campaign can be replayed after you beat it with the same character you were using before. On top of those, there's a rather extensive multiplayer mode where you can pick certain chapters or the entire game to play through. A game can be joined mid-session, allows for trade between players, and can be set to loop back on itself to continue playing the same area. Enemies scale to player levels, and a server creator can specify what power levels players need to be in order to join up.   Graphically, Mage Knight is alright. Some environments look pretty and have attractive glowing effects floating across their surfaces.  Enemy models are interesting, and the animations are enjoyable to watch, though a lot of the characters look stiff in the knees. At the same time, the game doesn't provide much that hasn't been seen before. There are ice and fire levels, for instance. Also dragons, elves in shining armor, dwarves tossing bombs, evil wizards, and women wearing skimpy yet somehow protective armor.   The game's sound is less enjoyable. Some of the monster screams are really annoying and they shout quite freqeuntly. Spell effects can be grating on your ears as well. Some of the soundtrack is pretty good, though standard orchestral fantasy fare.    We should also point out a few bugs we found while playing. The game wouldn't seem to work on a system using a Radeon X1900 graphics card. Everything loaded fine, but the camera would rotate wildly around the screen, making it impossible to play. Also, once we beat the game, one of our save files became corrupted forcing us to start a few areas back. Apparently these issues are being worked on, but for now, that's what to expect.As a Diablo-style click-fest dungeon crawler, Mage Knight never aspires to be particularly complicated, which is fine. It's got a good statistical progression system, lots of skills for players to choose from, plenty of items to chase after, and diversions like forging and potion creation. Unfortunately, the game suffers from all around poor AI, several bugs like being able to blast spells through doors, and an all too beneficial save-respawn system that make it incredibly easy to beat. The derivative storyline and awful voice acting don't help either. Despite the numerous multiplayer and single-player features built in to extend the game's replay, you won't really want to utilize them. Mage Knight is a mediocre game that gets old after a few hours.", "date": "Oct 6, 2006"}
