Ask any loyal baseball fan, and they'll blindly assure you that baseball is still the heart and soul of America.  Ask a die hard Raiders fan and you may get a very different answer (and a whiff of their breath... P + U).  With all this dissention, it's nice to know there's one thing every sports enthusiast will agree on this summer: Inside Pitch 2003 is nobody's favorite pastime.  In fact, Inside Pitch has the dubious honor of easily being the worst baseball game on Xbox this year.  With no franchise mode, mediocre graphics, forgettable sound, and ugly gameplay, Inside Pitch puts Microsoft sports on the same level as 989 Studios.  In short: This game sucks, don't buy it.  Features: Every big league team and all the real players Commentary by Joe Buck and Tim McCarver Custom soundtracks Downloadable content Online head-to-head play  Gameplay Inside Pitch 2003 has been hidden, for the most part, by Microsoft and with good reason.  Pitch is a poorly assembled mass of bad design and limited creative vision.  At first I thought Pitch was merely a rushed project, one that could have been better with a longer development time, but after spending some serious time with the game, I've come to realize that the game simply isn't on the right track.  No amount of extra tweaking and not even the inclusion of a franchise mode could put Pitch into the same category as EA's MVP or Sega's World Series.    Control Inside Pitch has some curious control choices.  While much of the control is set up to match the majority of baseball titles on the market, Pitch chooses to switch things up in some of the more tried-and-true areas.    The default control has base throwing on the right thumbstick as opposed to the face buttons.  This means you must push down on the thumbstick to throw home, right to throw to first, etc.  But the thumbstick isn't the most accurate thing in the world and there are plenty of times where a throw will go to the wrong base simply because you weren't pressing strictly left on the right thumbstick.  Fortunately, you can change the throwing option to the face buttons.  But even using the face buttons, there's another, more significant problem with throwing out runners.  Inside Pitch doesn't preload throws.  So you can't press the B button as you're about to scoop up a grounder so that it can be instantly slung to first.  Instead, you have to wait for the ~pick up the ball~ animation to finish before you can press the button and throw to the base.  This results in some stilted looking plays and, sometimes, runners being safe when they should have been thrown out.    The other curious control change comes with power swings.  When batting, the Y button bunts, A button gives a normal swing, and the triggers serve to control baserunners.  That leaves the B and X buttons available.  Instead, the makers of Pitch decided to put the power swing on the black button.  Who thought that was a smart choice?  What play testers were saying ~Yeah, that's the perfect button to use... don't sweat the X and B buttons, those are for chumps.~  On the field The batting and pitching operate somewhat like High Heat.  You select your pitch (each pitcher has up to four of the nine pitches available in the game) and then choose a general location and whether you want to throw a ball or a strike.  However, the lack of randomness in the pitches makes this less organic than in High Heat.  In fact, unless your pitcher is getting tired (which takes a good while), he'll almost always hit the exact spots.  Batting requires both timing and aiming in the right location.  The strike zone is broken up into the nine-square grid standard.  Hitting a long ball simply requires choosing the same location as the pitcher and then not swinging too early or late.  Inside Pitch dissolves most of the ~hey, $#^& happens~ aspects of baseball with pitching and hitting that feels more like a test of rock/paper/scissors than actual baseball physics.      Fielding follows the trend of most baseball games in that it really doesn't matter who's on the field.  Ben Grieves can make a great play just as often as Ichiro.  However, Pitch takes fielding to an even lower level with some physically impossible throws and some terrible cameras.  Once the ball is thrown, the camera does a weird spin into a cinematic mode.  Occasionally this offers a cool visual, like when Nomar snaps up a grounder and flings it to first and the camera flips 180 degrees just as the ball reaches its apex.  But in other instances it's terrible.  For instance, if the right fielder throws a ball home, the camera switches to a low-perspective view of the catcher waiting for the ball, which sometimes can take 20 seconds to get home.    The ball itself has some wonky physics.  Grounders will often die rolling towards the outfield and throws home will often end in you watching the ball slowly trickle towards the plate.  The animations hang up the game when it comes to double plays and there's never a sense that the game is flowing well.  This would have been a killer game in the 16-bit era, but this is 2003 and Inside Pitch is way behind the times.  My other big annoyance on fielding is the dive button.  A player will be making a slow jaunt after a ball, but hit the A button to dive and they will launch forward, sometimes a good 10 feet.  Infielders will shoot across the ground as if they were Rayman leaping across a chasm.  And often the dive is so dramatic it will shoot you past the ball.  If only the crowd could boo the bad gameplay mechanics.  The crowd doesn't boo this, though, because they're too busy jeering the bad baserunning AI.  Here's the situation: Ichiro is on third base with one out.  A ground ball is hit and fielded deep in the infield by the second baseman.  The second baseman barely gets out the runner at first.  Ichiro scored, though, right?  No.  Despite his speed and the fact that it was a ground ball deep in the infield, Ichiro didn't even take a step off third base.  There are many more similar situations like this.  Inside Pitch is simply minor leagues compared to today's baseball games.  The last thing I'll mention on the ~General Grievances~ list, is that there are no replays.  That's right -- No manual replays and no in-game automatic replays.  So when you smoke the ball down the line, you can't go back and check if it was really foul.  You can't see if you actually reached base before being tagged.  You can't watch your bomber smash that home run.  How basic are replays?      Game modes Inside Pitch's gameplay may not be anything to write home about (unless you like writing about bad experiences), but there are some nice extra features that help redeem the game to some degree.  There's no franchise mode -- which instantly puts Inside Pitch on the outside looking in among the baseball games of 2003 -- but there are some other modes that offer hope for next season.  Of course, there are the standards like single game, season (just one), playoffs, and Home Run Derby, but Pitch also comes to the mound with Championship Challenges, Training mode, and online play.  Championship Challenges are almost exactly like the challenges found in All-Star Baseball 2004.  There are less than a dozen, but each one takes an instance from the 2002 baseball season and has you attempt to duplicate the feat.  It's a lot of fun and earns you extra development points for your created players.  It would have been nice to see more than just the handful included, but a little is more than none.  The create/train mode lets you create a character with a decent level of customization.  Then, using points, you can increase specific stat areas.  Buying an upgrade in an area, let's say Arm Strength, earns you a roll of some random dice to see how great the stat increases (from 1-50).  Performing different drills earns you extra points, as well.  All this is pretty cool, but it's also sort of worthless.  After all, there's no franchise mode.  You're creating a player who's stats will never last more than 162 games, who will grow as you train him but not as you play through a succession of seasons.  Riiiiiight.    Inside Pitch 2003 has one big advantage over all other Xbox baseball games -- Online play.  Online, things are very simple.  It's just one-on-one head-to-head play.  Gameplay is relatively smooth, with some games having serious slowdown and others coming through as if you were playing with your buddy sitting right next to you on the couch.  Certainly the game's a bit more fun against someone else and not the questionable AI, and online is certainly a big step, but Inside Pitch needs to have everything every other Xbox baseball game has before adding in new features.  Franchise mode and replays, please.  Graphics Inside Pitch is a tale of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.  The Good: Stadiums.  All of them look very accurate, including color and even signs (IP actually has the John Hancock sign in Fenway) and the lighting at night is fantastic.  The Bad: Character models.  There are different model types, but some of them are a bit too anemic and others not bulky enough.  The faces aren't bad for some of the high profile players. At least they don't look like plastic dolls anymore.  The Ugly: Animations.  Though Nomar's batting stance has been recreated to perfection, just about everyone else looks generic.  The animations are stiff and sometimes the throwing animations are completely wrong (like Roberto Alomar underhanding a ball from second base to first).  From stuttery animations to funky animations, Inside Pitch has them all!  Sound Inside Pitch includes the use of custom soundtracks, so you can have various songs from your own ripped music play in menus and when players step to the plate.  However, you can't assign a specific song to a player, so it ends up just being a hodge-podge of songs.  A good thought, at least.  The nice thing about pumping your own soundtrack is that it drowns out much of the sound effects, which are all quite bad.  The crack of the bat sounds like someone popping their finger against the inside of their cheek, the crowd cheers are minimal but sound canned.  There's no heckling and nothing that sets one stadium apart from the next.  The commentary, though, is Pitch's one saving audio grace.  I'm not a big fan of Joe Buck and Tim McCarver, but they do a fine job offering the play-by-play and color commentary.  McCarver offers some good insight into both teams and stadiums and Buck's play-by-play is usually accurate to the situation.  A decent choice of broadcasters and good in-game implementation.    Inside Pitch 2003 can be fun in small spurts, but it's just not that great of a game.  It's got a lot of weak points and only a handful of strengths. Yes, it features downloadable content, custom soundtracks, and online head-to-head play, but what good are these things if the game itself isn't good?  This is a game that should not have been released.  It's the first taste of MS baseball for gamers, and that taste is poison, tainting next year's version before it's ever been seen.  All I can do is play the game, shake my head, and ask: ~Wha' happened??!~", "date": "May 22, 2003"}
