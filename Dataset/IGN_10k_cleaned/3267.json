The place is packed, and Flipside is putting on one of their best shows ever. That is, until each member is sucked away and captured by an evil mad scientist. It's up to Flipside's trusty roadie, Wasa B., to track down his friends and save them from the evil doctor.   Whirl Tour is an extreme sports game set on powered scooters, with a slight hint of a platformer game. The game borrows much from the Tony Hawk Pro Skater series and its kin, such as its control scheme, level and goal layout, and general play style.   Gameplay  For the most part, the game's control works fairly well. It follows the standard Tony Hawk control scheme, so if you've played any extreme sports games in the past couple of years, you'll feel right at home. X is your jump button, Square and Circle are the trick buttons, and Triangle grinds. Tapping up once or twice before jumping will perform either a Fastplant or Nosehop, and will bag you a bit more air than normal.    Along with earning you the ability to perform ~Sick Tricks,~ pulling off nice combos will earn you adrenaline. Pressing L2 will use your adrenaline in return for a nice speed boost. Your player also has a health meter in the game, and crashing or generally getting injured too often will end your run.    Throughout the game you'll notice a few circular pickups that you can grab. Aside from health pickups, there are a few that drastically affect your scooting ability. A jump icon will cause you to jump higher and farther than normal, while the balance icon will reset your balance meter to assist with extra long grinds. The spin icon will cause your player to spin ultra-fast, enabling you to pull 3000+ degree spins with no problem. Eat your heart out, Tony Hawk.   One of the best things about the game is how some of its lines are laid out. They're not all great, mind you, but they're generally laid out fairly well. It's possible to grind from end to end on most levels, and reaching some of the scooter icons will require grinding a fairly long and nicely-connected set of rails. Stringing sections of the level together for some nice combos is also generally easy.   Unfortunately, the level goals usually leave a bit to be desired and can get a bit repetitive. Each level has the standard score goal, where you have to accumulate a certain amount of points in one session. The point goals are pretty easy to obtain simply by performing a lengthy string of manuals and quickly become a joke. Most levels also have some sort of goal where you need to knock an object over. All of these goals simply require grinding one easily reachable rail, and these goals are also a joke. The game also has a few other goal types, like grinding over a certain number of objects or on a certain rail, but since you're given three minutes for each session, they're all easy to get to and grind in one turn.  Buddha  In trying to bring a bit of a platformer feel over to the game, Whirl Tour has a few bosses that must be defeated on each level. Defeating each of the level's bosses will earn you keys that open a secret area which contain the mad scientist's transmitters. Breaking the three transmitter switches will open up the racing stage for each level. Unfortunately, the boss fights didn't turn out to be as exciting as they probably had hoped. Bosses are simply defeated by performing a few tricks into them and avoiding their attacks. There are only three attack types that the bosses can use, and once you learn how to deal with each one, none of the bosses offer anything new and become fairly easy and boring to beat.   After destroying the transmitter on each stage, you'll unlock the race mode for that level. The races actually take place in an entirely new downhill level, which aren't playable in any other mode. You'll be racing against the mutated form of one of the band members, and beating them will turn them back to normal, and allow you to select them to race with. The races require performing tricks along the way in order to earn boost, and then using the boost while grinding as much as possible. The races can be a bit tricky at first, but once you learn a proper race line they aren't too difficult. The race levels are a decent idea at first, but the levels are all too similar to offer anything new once you've done it a couple times.    Getting back to the normal levels, the ramps in the game are an odd bunch. It seems that some ramps vary in how high they'll let you launch off of them, and others make it nearly impossible to perform a Fastplant or Nosehop to catch more air. These ramps are almost always set up around goals or areas that the designers would rather have you use another way to reach. For instance, there may be one of the transmitter switches that you should be able to reach by launching from a ramp, but the designers practically force you to use an intended rail to reach it. Until you realize that the ramps are sometimes limiting, it can be a bit frustrating trying to Nosehop off a certain ramp, only to catch just a few feet of air time and time again.    Grinding can be a little unforgiving at times, as it's sometimes tricky to get your player to grind the correct ledge or rail. In many areas, there are two ledges that run right next to each other but split off at a point and lead to two entirely different areas, both of which you're likely to need to get to. There are also a few spots in the game that are hard to get your rider to grind on. There'll be an oddly shaped object that you may need to grind, but your rider will sometimes either grind another rail close by, or just fail to hop up on the intended object at all. As most of the goals are fairly easy and you have a fair amount of time per session, these problems don't impede your run through the game much, but they can cause a bit of frustration from time to time.   Grinding is a bit unrealistic in a few ways that can help boost your score, for better or for worse. For starters, gravity has no effect on you once you begin grinding. Grinding up a slanted rail will have no effect on speed, as well as grinding down a rail won't speed you up, either. It's also easy to keep your balance going for extremely long periods of time. The meter starts moving pretty fast after a while, but it's still easy to keep from falling for quite a while. That, combined with the balance pickups, help to make 30 second or so grinds a reality.   Each level has 20 scooter icons that you can collect to earn new scooters. You'll get a new scooter for every 20 icons you collect, regardless of which levels they were earned on. So for instance, you can collect 10 on each of the first two levels, and a new ride is yours. Some of the scooters offer a nice boost in stats and may be much better than what you might be used to riding, but the order that you receive the scooters in doesn't really make any sense. For instance, the third and sixth scooters are probably the two best in the game. The fourth scooter has practically the same stats as the scooter you start with, and the fifth is only slightly better than the fourth. So after you get the third, you basically need to collect 60 icons until you've gotten another scooter worth switching to.  Impossible  After completing the accompanying race for each level and saving one of the band members, you're awarded with some character stat boosts. You don't have any control over what's given to you, but it's generally a nice boost to a few categories. One disappointing thing is that every character that you unlock has exactly the same stats, and every time you finish a race, every character is given the exact same stat boosts. The band members that you unlock don't offer any new styles of play; they're essentially just an alternate set of costumes to choose from. Oddly enough, you can also switch back to previous stat levels. So for instance, you might have earned yourself stat level five, but if you wanted to set the stats back to their original values, you can. There doesn't seem to be an apparent reason that anyone would want to do this, though you can always set them back up again if you move them down.   Aside from the bit about the unforgiving grinding, there are a few hints that the game wasn't quite polished before release. A perfect example is the game's story, as there are quite a few discrepancies between the intro movie and what's written in the instruction booklet. Both stories set up the same premise, with the six band members being captured by the mad scientist and Wasa B. grabbing his scooter to head off to save them. The instruction booklet, however, describes that Flipside is playing in a large, open aired stadium when the band members are struck by bursts of electrical energy, pulling them upward into the source of the energy. It also describes a sequence where Wasa B. uses the band's video recording equipment to track down the scientist and follow him. The introduction movie, however, is of a much lesser scale. The band is playing in what looks like a small club, each band member is sucked into portals that form behind them as opposed to being pulled into a large electrical field in the sky, and Wasa B. never uses the band's video equipment. It seems that the instruction booklet was the intended story, but that it wasn't changed when the intro movie didn't quite match up to spec. It's a relatively small detail in the scheme of things, but it's a pretty noticeable difference that could have been fixed in no time, and you can't help but feel that the game was a little rushed to market.    Graphics  Whirl Tour has its ups and downs graphically. The characters are about as basic and uninspired as you can get. They all have a cartoon-like look about them, and there's enough detail in them to get their design across, but their actual design is fairly boring. A few of the characters are very similar also, which doesn't help that at all. There are a number of costumes that you can unlock for each character, and while those are decent, they don't really help give the characters back any of the life they're sorely missing.   The levels themselves are designed reasonably decent. There's plenty of detail in the environment, but the texture work is a little spotty at times. Unlike some of the characters, all of the levels are designed in a unique fashion, and bring about a certain unique style to them. The goals are what make the levels fairly boring, however. Had some of the environments had better stuff to do in them, they would have been much more exciting.   The game does have some nice volumetric lighting in a few areas. You'll see light streaking down through windows, and those areas look pretty nice. The draw distance in each of the levels is pretty good, and you won't really ever notice any slowdown.   Sound  The game's soundtrack feels a bit odd here. It's a nice mix of techno, punk, hip-hop and other styles, though most of it seems a little out of place with the lighthearted feel of the rest of the game. It's odd to be scooting along with a colorful character to some chaotic punk rock. If your brain can separate the two, though, the soundtrack works fine. There are also hidden CDs in each level that unlock new tunes, which is a nice touch and adds a bit to the replay factor.   As for the rest of the sound effects, they work fine but aren't anything worth writing home about. Most of what you'll hear besides the music and simple crashing sounds are basic quips from each of the characters. Some of the character voices bring out a little more personality than the actual character designs do, but that's not saying much. None of the voices are entirely annoying, and they don't talk often enough to seem repetitive, though there isn't really anything they say that's really worth listening to.   All in all, Whirl Tour is about as basic as an extreme sports game as you can get. Of course, once you realize that everyone is riding a scooter, what would you expect? For the most part, the control handles well, and some of the level design is fairly decent, but the goals aren't unique or challenging enough to really bring any excitement into the game. There are a few decent two-player modes, and there's a fair amount of stuff to unlock, so the game should provide for a reasonable amount of playing time if you don't find yourself bored after a while, which is pretty likely.", "date": "Nov 25, 2002"}
