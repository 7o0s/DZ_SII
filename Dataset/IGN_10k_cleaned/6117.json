Several companies we're showing up urban-themed fare -- even Disney! -- and the main hall was dominated by signage proclaiming the arrival of ~Barrio Mobile~ and ~BlingTones.~ How apropos that Hudson's D12 Pro Wrestling show up on my LG VX8000 on the same week I stood agog beneath a ten-foot tall crunk goblet.   Now, at this point in the game, I never download a mobile wrestler expecting an experience akin to some of THQ's fine console title, but the general shallowness of D12 Pro Wrestling somewhat surprised me. If you're going to lay down the change required for such a license (Eminem is not in the game, mind you), why not go all the way and actually create a good fighting engine to go with it? Within minutes, after goofing off with the members of D12 and seeing their special attacks, D12 Pro Wrestling loses its charms.   The fighting system is simple -- perhaps unfortunately simple. Moves are assigned to up, down, and right. There is no actual moving your fighter around the ring. Pressing left blocks, and holding down ~OK~ charges your juice meter. Juice is required to pull of some of the stronger attacks, as well as unlock a ~savage~ move. Savage moves are not unlike signature moves, where each D12 member gets to put a little groove on the screen. Bizarre, for example, belches green smoke at his opponent with a relatively harmless name. As if it was some sort of secret what the green smoke really was.   I can appreciate easy-to-pick-up controls, but D12 Pro Wrestling's refusal to give you control over the basic placement of the fighter reduces the game to little more than a slap fight, with you trying to get in a move before your opponent can. He charges, you strike. You block and hope the opponent tries to strike. There are some combos you can pull off, and each fighter has their own individual moves.   D12 Pro Wrestling features a solid character line-up for fans of D12. Proof, Kon Artis, Bizarre -- the gang's all here. There are also some extra characters, such as Groupie, and a surprise appearance by Hudson's very own Bomberman. Trust me, Bomberman is way out of place here and I couldn't help wishing they hadn't included him. The character models are detailed enough that you will recognize each member of the group. There are several different backgrounds, too, such as a garage and a circus. Since the game is called D12 Pro Wrestling, there are beep-boop versions of D12 songs in the game.  D12 Pro Wrestling is what it is -- but that wasn't enough for me. Granted, I'm not exactly a fan of D12 (I like Em's solo work instead) but that doesn't mean I cannot spot D12 Pro Wrestling's glaring weaknesses. I like simple mobile games, but only when they should be simple. Something like Zuma and Skipping Stone -- appropriately simple. If you are going to create a wrestling game, there should be a little more meat on the bones.", "date": "Oct 4, 2005"}
