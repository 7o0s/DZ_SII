Originally released as a casual PC download from powerhouse PlayFirst, Oasis is a deft combination of Civilization-esque strategy -- building infrastructure, researching technology, deploying units -- and engaging puzzle play.   You control a burgeoning Egyptian empire seeking out the wealth of the twelve Glyphs, an ancient source of power. You begin each campaign on a blank screen, the horizon obscured by the fog of war. As you move square by square around the map, you scout out the immediate surroundings. Sometimes you uncover cities that you offer human resources, sometimes you just cross the burning sands, earning only a pittance of followers with each step. Exploration of the environment is hardly easy-breezy, though. Within a specific number of turns, an army of barbarians will storm your new lands, eager to sack and pillage. If you play it smart, you can assemble a solid empire to repel the encroachers. Otherwise, you are practically helpless to watch your cities burn.   There is a surprising amount of strategy in Oasis. On the first play-through -- you must collect twelve Glyphs to win -- you're likely to miss out on most elements, especially if you play the easiest setting. But once you goose up the difficulty, you must start employing tricks and smarts to beat back the barbarians. Example: As you cross the deserts, look for grasslands to indicate that a city is nearby. Or scour the outer squares to uncover the cairn, the origin point of the barbarian attack. If you find the cairn, you're at a huge advantage because you'll know then which city the thugs will attack first and can adequate set up a defense. The trade off, of course, is that you've expended turns to seek out the cairn, turns that you could have used to maybe find another city or build more roads. Building roads between the cities is incredibly important, as you can only transfer forces between linked metropolises.   Technology features heavily in the game, too. On each stage, you can see certain tech icons hanging on the right side of the screen. Spearheads offer greater resistance to the barbarians. An idol represents an individual of talent, like a scout or general. After uncovering a city, you can use a turn to click on the city again and see if these techs can be applied. If you find a talent, they will often have some requirement to earn their skills, such as finishing a level with a certain number of cities intact. You can also assign followers to work mines you discover. It takes 10 followers to start progress, but every turn after the assignment, they inch closer to burrowing out new tech, such as a helmet that indicates improved defenses.   And then there's the titular oasis. Somewhere on each map is a lake that holds both the obelisk with the glyph and scarab power, which is kind of like points. You must complete the stage with the glyph intact to bank it. If the barbarians sack enough cities, they will go to the glyph and try to destroy it. The glyph automatically destroys 50 barbarians, so it's like a last ditch defense. But even if the glyph polishes off the thugs, you still lose it for that stage.   All of this adds up to a solid game for strategy fans. Action gamers won't necessarily dig the pacing of the game, but if you are itching for a briskly clever resource management game, Oasis can deliver. The easy setting is just too easy, so consider just trying it out for a few stages just to get the hang of the mechanics before moving on to the upper settings. Over time, you will develop your own way of attacking each campaign. Maybe you'll seek the cairn first. Or you'll immediately assign resources to the mines, and then just comb the desert to pick up extra followers. But you'll always have you eyes open for farmland, because discovering and linking the cities is the best way to win.   My biggest knocks against Oasis are the production values and the ease of unraveling the game's secrets. I tested the game on an LG VX8600 -- hardly a slouching handset. But the game is pretty barebones without many effects or detailed sprites. If Konami and PlayFirst create a sequel -- and I hope they do with even more tech to discover (maybe even the ability to select what you want to dig for in the mines, or assign the first city you discover to research tech?) -- they need to give this game a solid visual upgrade. Even though game play is king, Oasis deserves to look as good as possible.   As for the longevity, I felt after a few hardcore days with the game, I squeezed pretty much all I could out of it. They were fun sessions to be sure, but once I nailed down my strategy, the game never had any more surprises: Same tech, same individuals, same tactics. And then my interest started to wane.  I am a huge Civilization nut, so Oasis was exactly my type of game. So, consider your own preferences when checking my enthusiasm for Oasis. I'm sorry the game doesn't look better, because a good title always deserves to put its best foot forward. Otherwise, I was immediately addicted to Oasis and keep at it until I beat the bottom three difficulty settings. But then I was done. While it lasts, though, Oasis offers smart strategy game play.", "date": "Jan 2, 2007"}
