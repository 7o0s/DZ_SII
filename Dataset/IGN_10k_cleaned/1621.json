Through games such as Twisted Metal and Warhawk the talented development team helped define the system in the early years of its life.   While most of the people responsible for those classics have since gone on to other things, the name SingleTrac does have a legacy behind it. Imagine my surprise when I saw the SingleTrac logo on the box for Animorphs.  Animorphs is a series of children's books and a weekend TV show about a group of kids who can morph into different animals. Naturally, that would lead to a good idea for a video game, if only it was done right. That isn't the case here.  Gameplay  Animorphs as a game is a platformer, and a below average one at that. The levels alternate between standard side scrolling levels and areas where you can move in and out of the background in a very limited way. The problem is, the game is just so boring your main challenge will be to stay awake throughout each level.  While playing as one of the kids, you can only run and jump  you cannot attack. The only time you are able to defend yourself is at specific points throughout each level where you are morphed into an animal and forced to fight off one or two bug-like enemies. The pattern of each level includes jumping on some platforms, fight two enemies, jump some more, fight, and repeat. A slight bit of variety comes in one level where you are a dolphin swimming down a canal, which instantly sparks some Ecco flashbacks (only this time, you can slam into a tuna net).   Throughout each level you collect ~A~ tokens, and after one hundred you get an extra life. That would be useful if the ~1Up~ items weren't as common as the life power ups, which means the game becomes pretty easy after a while, but since it is targeted towards kids you cannot really fault it for that.  Graphics Surprisingly, the game has some environments better than what you may expect. The textures are pretty smooth and look almost high res in some points, and there is very little (almost none) clipping or visible seams. Some textures, such as the bark on rolling logs, are very good.  It's too bad the same thing can't be said about the character and enemy models. Each of the characters looks as if only five or six polygons were used, and they have about four frames of animation. Worse yet, it almost looks as if the same polygonal model was used for all four characters, with the only difference being the textures. Enemies don't fare any better, with low poly models with few frames of animation being the standard.  Sound There isn't much to say about the sound. Each character has extremely annoying one-liners, but you can thankfully turn them off in the options menu. The music ranges from very forgettable ska riffs, and other than that, the game is relatively quiet. I'm a big platformer fan, be it 2D or 3D, I'll play it. This is one of the first platformers in a long time that I did not enjoy playing at all. A game hasn't bored me this much since Blasto. The only thing that was any fun was the dolphin sequence, I could slam into that tuna net all day!", "date": "Dec 9, 2000"}
