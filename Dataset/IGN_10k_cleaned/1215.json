While this design philosophy has carried over into most titles in the add-on's thin lineup, one game doesn't quite seem to fit into the 64DD software library. Developed by Media Factory and Seta, Japan Pro-Golf Tour 64 appears like a desperate attempt to attract older gamers to buy into the ill-fated disk drive subscription plan. With the exception of being able to compete in online tournaments, this golf sim could have easily been done on cartridge. Is the online component really strong enough to waste this game on the limited 64DD audience? The resounding answer is ~no.~ Seta has previously released a cartridge based Shogi game aimed at older players that included a modem and Golf Tour virtually includes the same online features. We wouldn't really care if Pro-Golf Tour 64 was just another sub-par golf game like St. Andrews -- but it's actually the best golf sim on the system.  Although Pro-Golf Tour 64 doesn't really break any new ground when it comes to golf games, it's one of the most complete golf packages we've seen on any console. For starters, the game comes with a full roster of officially licensed Nihon Pro-Golf Tour players and their '98 data, including the following: Masashi Ozaki, Hidemichi, Tanaka, Shigeki Maruyama, Hajime Meshiai, Naomichi Ozaki, Nobumitsu Yuhara, Satoshi Higashi, Tateo Ozaki, David Ishii, Tsukasa Watanabe, Hideki Kase, Ryoken Kawagishi, Tsuneyuki Nakajima, Yoshinori Kaneko, Nobuo Serizawa, Katsunari Takahashi, Masahiro Kuramoto, Hisayuki Sasaki, Isao Aoki and even veteran player Teruo Sugihara. If only US-made console golf games could offer an equivalent lineup of international players...   In addition to a simple player editor, there are six gameplay modes all in all. One or two players can compete in the Match Play mode while up to four can compete for the best score in the 18-hole Stroke Player mode. The game also features a Grand Opening Mode (compete with the world's best Japan Pro-Golfers,), a Career Mode, Qualifying Tournament (you create your own player and start with a handicap of 0) and Network Opening. The latter lets you connect to Randnet and compete in an All-Japan tournament.  But it doesn't stop there, unlike the one-course Waialae wonder published in the US by Nintendo, Japan Pro-Golf packs 10 officially licensed courses from all across Japan. Both courses and players are brought to life with smooth, polygonal graphics. The courses are as detailed as they get on the N64 (even though trees and spectators still turn into a blurry mess if you get too course) and the players sport convincing swing, putt and ~color~ animations (such as victoriously raising their fists when they score a ~nice shot~ or covering their eyes after landing in a bunker).  The swing mechanics take some getting used to, especially after playing the other N64 golf outings, but it eventually works out nicely. Instead of having to hit your button to activate the swing, you simply pull the analog stick to fill the power meter. The further you pull, the higher your power indicator goes -- like in real life there is no timing involved in deciding how hard you will hit the ball. The actual timing part comes in when you swing. You need to release the analog stick right when the pulse meter (located in the lower right corner of the screen) is at its smallest. The trick is of course that the pulse speed increases depending on the difficulty of the shot and the force behind your swing.   On the audio side, the game is less impressive. While the classical opening music is nice, the rest of the game is accompanied by cheesy Casio synth pop. But the biggest disappointment is that the game lacks voice commentary. With all the space they've got on a 64DD disk they could have easily had a TV Tokyo announcer do some play-by-play.  It's a shame Media Factory got suckered into making this title for 64DD. Japan Pro-Golf Tour 64 is a well-rounded golf sim for players who can't get themselves to try the arcade-style Mario Golf. While I appreciate the inclusion of a network mode, this game should have been released on cartridge a long time ago (the title has been delayed numerous times solely to fill a gaping hole in the 64DD's release calendar).", "date": "Sep 2, 2000"}
