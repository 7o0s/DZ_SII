On the original release of Road Rash back in the early 90s, I really tried liking the game, but ultimately it was slow, chunky, redundant...and a mystery why so many of my peers loved the game. Even updates to the series on the Genesis and 3DO failed to kindle affection for the series, no matter how hard the developers tried. But the legend of Road Rash has lived on throughout the years, showing up in sequels across the PlayStation and Nintendo 64, even appearing as a really bland Game Boy Color game a good three years back.  Which is why it's surprising that I actually enjoyed playing DSI Games' rendition of the series on the Game Boy Advance. Road Rash: Jailbreak for the GBA handheld is fast and furious, and actually poses a challenge throughout its six tracks and two sets of difficulty levels, and offers a nice variety of gameplay options for such a simplistic game concept. It's over a little too quickly, but it's a heck of a ride while it lasts. Features Four different racers Six locations, two different difficulty levels Cop Patrol Mode Link cable support for two players  Password save Road Rash: Jailbreak borrows its namesake from the last game released on the PSOne system a couple years ago, but other than lifting a few assets from that development, the GBA game is really its own design. Development on the game was handled by European developer Magic Pockets, who obviously used its knowledge and technology acquired the visually impressive F1 2003 GBA title for Electronic Arts and DSI Games. Road Rash: Jailbreak builds its game design upon the formula established in past Road Rash games, but constructs its own creation with the speed, intensity and gameplay elements expected in today's gaming day and age.   This combat racer puts players in charge of their choice of four distinctly different racers in an all-out race from start to finish, trying to stay upright on a bike while getting whaled on by the opposition. Luckily, the character the player chooses is also armed with his or her own weapon that can do equal damage. The only way to move onto the next track is to cross the finish line first, and the only way players will be able to do that is to be both aggressive in their racing and combat skills...trying to unseat the opposition to gain that extra distance while avoiding on-street and trackside obstacles, as well as aggressive attacks from their weaponry. Players can also pick up scattered, random power-ups, such as invincibility, oil slicks, and a napalm-like substance that sets the road behind them on fire. These rear attacks are actually well-implemented because the developers put to use an icon arrow that grows and shrinks behind the player, the size and location showing just how close the opponent is. Money icons are scattered in rows across the road, and collecting them builds up the player's bank account, making bike upgrades much quicker than just using the earnings after coming in first.  To make gameplay a little more challenging, there's also a bunch of motorcycle cops set out to put a premature end to the brutal racing; if these guys manage to knock the player off their saddle, regardless if they've still got the strength to get back on to continue, the race ends. These guys are just as vulnerable as the actual racers...so players are encouraged to wail on them to knock 'em out of the picture. But they're a bit more aggressive, and tend to focus on one particular rider regardless of who's in first. Nothing's as satisfying as clobbering a highway patrolman with a gigantic shovel, watching the poor guy fly off the bike onto the pavement below. Damn that feels good.  What drives this game is Magic Pocket's ambitious pseudo-3D engine that pushes a fast speed and a smooth framerate, even as it draws detailed flowing hills with a lot of on-screen objects like traffic, cones, and innocent bystanders along the side of the road. Road Rash is no longer the chunky, chuggy game that came out on the Genesis...it's now incredibly fast and intense thanks to the GBA game's impressive engine. The developers might've gotten a little too ambitious, though, since there's a few patches of choppiness when the screen gets a little cluttered with obstacles and enemies. Which is probably why the team scaled back the amount of opponents during a race; most Road Rash games feature races against more than a dozen bikers. In Road Rash: Jailbreak for the Game Boy Advance, there are only three other racers. Which means far less competition...and far fewer opponents to bash during the race. Road Rash: Jailbreak is a bit light in tracks, and the racing's over after two runs through six different locations...so don't expect to get a whole lot out of Road Rash: Jailbreak's main mode. But the inclusion of a fun ~Cop Patrol~ mode adds another layer to the game; here, players assume the role as one of the motorcycle cops, and the only task is to head on down each of the six tracks and take out all four of the racers before they cross the finish line. Of course, if they manage to take out the cop, the challenge is over and it's back to the start. Players can also unlock a Survival challenge after completing the main game, and they even have the ability to take on a buddy in a two-player link up mode. There's even a Hang On style time-trial, but since the racing isn't quite as technical as Hang On, this gameplay mode feels like a slight afterthought.  The lack of save RAM means that the game can't save specific data to cartridge; all the money collected on the tracks has to be spent within that game session or it's lost forever, since the password isn't extensive enough to remember that extra cash. But as annoying and unwelcome as password saving is on the GBA, at least Magic Pockets did it right with Road Rash Jailbreak...the codes to move on are simple, English words, and the system remembers the last password earned so it can be pulled up outside of the gameplay. And there are two different passwords; one to record which tracks have been completed, and one that remembers the different levels of each of the four racers. Road Rash: Jailbreak is an impressive production on the Game Boy Advance that's made a hater of the series (that would be me) into a believer that someone can make the idea work as a fun videogame. Even though the game needs more stuff across the board (tracks, opponents, gameplay options), it's impressive and definitely enjoyable enough to warrant a purchase...especially if you've had a blast with past games in the Road Rash series.", "date": "Sep 23, 2003"}
