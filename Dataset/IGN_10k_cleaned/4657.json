{"name": "Planet Zero", "name_review": "Planet Zero", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/04/20/planet-zero", "text": "Around this office, Gameloft's name is synonymous with ~quality.~ Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow and Prince of Persia: Sands of Time cemented the developer/publisher's place amongst the leading wireless companies -- it holds the crown when it comes to action games. But goes Gameloft's luck run out when it tackles a more fickle genre, the shooter?   Features:   Multiple levels  Auto-fire option  Big boss battles  Weapon power-ups   Planet Zero is Gameloft's stab at the shooter, and its slices most of the competition in two. The side-scrolling blaster employs all the great tricks of the 16-bit era shooters, such as R-Type and Gradius, but refines them for the handset experience -- you know, adding auto-fire and making concessions for the vertical nature of the screen.   Like any good shooter, the plot is pointless. All that matters is the frenzied nature of the game -- how many enemy ships can you blast out of the cosmos, how cool are the power-ups, and are the boss battles even remotely memorable? Planet Zero succeeds on all of these counts.   You have two shooting modes to choose from, each with five levels of powering up. The burst most will eventually fill the screen with bullets while the wave blast fires multiple ~balls~ of energy across the screen. Either one is equally deadly -- it's just a matter of preference. (Incidentally, we prefer the burst attack, as it's something of a screen-sweeper.) Other power-ups include shields and bombs.    Planet Zero includes an auto-fire feature, which we certainly recommend activating before heading into the fray. It help clear the heavens of space rocks, enemy ships, as well as rapidly dismantle bosses. Enemy placement is well thought-out, as Gameloft kept both auto-fire and screen orientation in mind while designing the game. No sudden surprises -- you always have a chance to kill an enemy before it reaches your side of the screen, even if it is a small chance.   The game looks fantastic, easily using every color in the rainbow. The seven levels are well-detailed, from the asteroid belt to the tunnel level. Enemy ships are surprisingly varied, and the mammoth bosses are very cool. Between missions, you watch tiny dialogue exchanges between floating heads. The game opens with a great little theme, then settles into some fine sound effects.  Planet Zero is yet another slamdunk for Gameloft. A shooter on the same level as Upstart Game's excellent Gradius, Planet Zero makes necessary concessions for the limitation of the tech -- enemy placement and whatnot -- but doesn't skimp on production values. This is the kind of shooter you would have expected Renovation to release on the Genesis... and that's a huge compliment.", "date": "Apr 20, 2004"}
