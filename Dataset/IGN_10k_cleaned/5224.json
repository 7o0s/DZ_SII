Capsule Monster Coliseum. So put your Yammi Yugi action figure away, turn off the cartoon, stash your deck, and pay attention: because its time for some turn-based strategy involving the usual crew of Yu-Gi-Oh characters and monsters.    Now of course, this isn't entirely new ground for the series, Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist of the Roses which debuted on the PS2 last year had a somewhat similar style of gameplay. As per every Yu-Gi-Oh! game there's a rock/paper/scissors order of attributes. In Capsule Monsters, there are two sets of four attributes and when symbols from different sets face each other, there is no effect. Each monster in the game has an attribute, as well as terrain on the map screen. This means that a successful duelist will study both his opponent and the arena before choosing which monsters to bring into battle.    Fans of the series may be expecting the monsters to spawn from cards, but this time the creatures are in a limited number of capsules that are set at the beginning of the battle. The number of monsters allowed on a map screen depends on the rules of the map and how many action points a player has. Action points also allow players to move their pieces, and once depleted, the turn is over. AP will replenish at the beginning of the next turn based on the monsters that have been summoned and a player's level. There are separate categories of HP and defense for the capsule form of a monster, but they are always significantly worse than the summoned monster. This means that there is no benefit to leaving capsules on the screen and players should summon monsters as quickly as possible.    Click For More Images Once the two sides have removed their army from the capsules, they then must navigate them across the map screen and into battle. Monsters can only move in certain patterns, such as diagonal lines, straight lines, or stepping-stone square patterns. Attack patterns are different from movement capabilities, so you'll end up checking both for every piece when the enemy gets close. These patterns seem simple but can be incredibly limiting, and players will often find themselves in close quarters with the enemy, but unable to position themselves for an attack.    When a player does manage to land an attack, figuring out what happens next is a snap. Take the monster's attack and subtract its victim's defense and the resulting number is the amount of damage dealt. Vanquishing an opponent's piece seems to always take two or three attacks, sometimes more against especially strong creatures.    As monsters rack up the kills and win battles, they will gain experience points, which lead to higher levels. At a certain level, some of them will even evolve into new creatures. Monsters can also learn abilities like healing spells that when used, take the place of moving and attacking. These abilities also cost the player action points, or can only be used a set number of times. Some monsters can also be fused together to form a new super monster. Players are able to select two monsters from a defeated foe after a battle and peruse the store on the map screen to make new creature purchases. The ability to evolve and fuse monsters, gives some meaning to these choices other than pure statistical superiority.     The battlefields start out very small, taking only a few moves to come head to head with your rival's forces. They grow slightly as the game progresses, leaving more chances to arrange the monsters. As stated earlier, the battlefields have attributes that will give the advantage to pieces of a certain alignment. One example of this is an early stage with an area contaminated with spores that will take 15 HP from all pieces except for those aligned with the wood attribute. Some of the maps will change halfway through a battle, usually offering more extreme attribute boosts.    With so many variables, it seems like the battles would be dynamic and unpredictable. However, the poor enemy AI allows the same tactic to be used in every battle that easily destroys the competition. For an easy win, simply summon as many monsters as allowable on a map and wait for the enemy to stupidly string out its pieces as it attempts to force a confrontation as early as possible. Sometimes sacrificing a piece is necessary to encourage this type of behavior, but more often than not, the enemy will offer up one piece at a time and allow it to be outnumbered. When all of the monsters have been defeated the battle ends.    Another way to win is to attack an opponent's symbol. These pieces cannot attack and reside at the corners of the map screen. They have HP just like a normal game piece and theoretically, going after an enemy's symbol can be a quick route to victory. However, until you develop some super powerful pieces with abnormal movement abilities, this isn't going to happen. Moving any piece away from the pack is a sure death sentence.     One problem I have with the map screen information is that an enemy's movement info is only available by selecting the monster and scrolling through their capabilities. Because the entire game is based on correctly positioning your pieces, this needs to be done rather often. It would be less frustrating if the movement data simply showed up on the map when a monster is selected with the cursor. Or, movement data for all monsters could be shown when the start button is pressed, instead of the useless grid.   Once maps are beaten in the campaign mode they are unlocked for use in the free battle mode at the main menu. There is also a multiplayer mode, which takes care of the mindless AI, but requires a friend. Luckily I was able to pay someone to be my friend for a couple of hours. Variables like monster points, max AP, and the number of monsters that are allowed on the map can be adjusted. Players can also wager a monster from their deck which will be lost if they lose the duel. This is a welcome addition to the game, now if only the game were more fun in the first place.    While the monsters appear on the map screen as small sculptures resembling chess pieces, each battle is animated in full 3D. Watching the classic Yu-Gi-Oh! cast duke it out after every move is fun at first but quickly loses its appeal and battles cannot be skipped mid-scene by pressing a button. Luckily, they can be toggled on and off at any time during a battle. After an hour or so, gamers will find themselves only viewing battles when an especially interesting monster makes its debut.It is always interesting to see a series like Yu-Gi-Oh! expand into different styles of game play. However, just because this is an original concept, doesnt mean that it is any fun. In fact, I prefer the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game to this monster chess game. If you are hurting for some turn-based strategy there are better places to turn on the PS2 like the excellent Disgaea or La Pucelle Tactics. As for Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monster Coliseum, save this one for a rental, if that.", "date": "Nov 5, 2004"}
