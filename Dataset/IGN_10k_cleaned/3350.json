So when publisher Jaleco announced the return of Jazz Jackrabbit to the gaming scene earlier this year, fans of the bunny superhero from nearly a decade ago were no doubt thrilled.  To get a brief history of this furry 2D action title, check out our earlier write-up on the game.  The short version is this: Jazz has two previous PC titles under his belt, and both were cherished back in the day.  Now in 2002, the GBA is, of course, the system of choice for such 2D revivals, thus there's no surprise that Jaleco is siccing the hare on the handheld market and just in time for the holiday season.  While it's hard to recommend the little Jazz furball over some of the more impressive GBA hits landing on retail counters right now, this straightforward platformer offers just enough visual style and gameplay diversity to keep it out of the bargain bin before New Year's.  Features  24 single-player levels scattered across various intergalactic environments Both single and multi-PAK gameplay for up to four players, featuring deathmatch and capture the flag modes Up to 11 unlockable multiplayer levels Customizable options include brightness adjustment and four different control styles Three cartridge save slots Only for Game Boy Advance  Our continuing story finds the protagonist, Jazz Jackrabbit, on his final mission to save the galaxy from evil before retiring to a tropical paradise.  Reluctant to accept this farewell tour of duty, Jazz is reassured by his commanding officer that his days of collecting tons of useless items are over.  Instead, he'll now follow in the footsteps of that other beloved rodent and grab as much cold, hard cash as possible as he scampers through the levels.  Fortunately for us, buckets of the green stuff are just hanging out in plain sight throughout all of the 24 alien environments you encounter.  Jazz must grab the dough and run, jump, and blast his way to the end of each level in standard platforming style.  Level design is, for the most part, very straightforward.  You'll run your way to the right, jump across floating platforms, grab the occasional keys to unlock doors, and repeat.  All the way, Jazz must blast down nicely drawn and stereotypically mindless enemy creatures opposing his path.  Despite his being a rabbit, Jazz doesn't do that tired ~jump on their heads~ routine.  Instead, Jazz takes a more subtle approach: excessive firepower.  Players will have a selection of up to 6 different firearms, ranging from the default Star Wars-esque blaster to Uzi's, rocket launchers, and even flamethrowers.  Not bad for a varmint on the bottom of the food chain.  At the end of each level, players can spend their cash on other weapons, ammo, and extra lives; thus snagging that dinero is a good thing.  Taking control of Jazz is quite simple and sufficiently responsive.  Once you master the basic jump, shoot, and duck concepts, there's really only the floating helicopter ears left to learn.  By holding the jump button as Jazz falls, players can squeeze out roughly five seconds of a controlled decent before falling to the ground again.  Since a tall, vertical drop will flatten the rabbit like fresh roadkill, your timing on this maneuver is critical.  But alas, it's an extremely simple move to grasp, and once you do, you're left with the realization that the thrill of controlling Jazz is disappointingly shallow.  While we respect the fact that this latest sequel is in keeping with its old-school roots, it would have been nice to see Jazz evolve with his entry into the 21st century -- perhaps grab onto narrowly missed ledges, or even kick up his heels for some kind of a double-jump ability.  With today's more flexible platforming stars already on the system, it's tough to get terribly excited over the tame moves sported by Jazz.      While these ho-hum controls are aided by the assortment of weapons at your disposal, using them to fight the onslaught of gun-toting baddies is equally shallow.  Most enemies sport a firearm of some sort, and most will fire sporadic bullets just as quickly as Jazz himself.  There's often little a player can do to avoid such shots, as jumping is too cumbersome to be effective and ducking will only result in an enemy doing the same.  Thus, when Jazz isn't jumping about between platforms collecting money, he's squatting and shooting bullets as quickly as possible across the screen and taking a few in the face himself.  The key to survival simply becomes pumping out the lead faster than your enemy, and keeping a sharp eye out for the generously placed health packs throughout each level.  Bullet spraying action is always good fun (especially when rabbits are involved), but the fact that there's little room for player skill to sway the outcome of such action is a serious detriment to the fun that this title has to offer. Other eyesores include the occasional framerate slowdown, repetitive '80s-style drum machine pop tracks, and a typically frustrating camera system that often keeps nearby ledges and moving platforms slightly out of visual range and hinders the player from even using the helicopter ear technique effectively.  But on a positive note, Jazz Jackrabbit is a fairly pretty title to look at.  The development team at Game Titan has created a nice collection of well-designed characters, including an improved version of Jazz himself.  The visual style is best described as two parts Looney Tunes and one part Don Bluth, and it creates a fun cast of characters that gamers will enjoy watching.  The animations are also well done, although a few more frames here and there would have helped to smooth them out.  Still, it's obvious that talented artists put some love into this project, with great colors, detailed scrolling backgrounds, and large, cartoony bosses seen throughout the relatively short quest.  Right on par with the simplistic fun offered by the single-player gameplay, Jazz Jackrabbit also includes both single and multi-PAK modes, allowing gamers to each control a Jackrabbit themselves and blast each other into tiny rabbit bits via either deathmatch or capture the flag modes.  While the single-PAK route is much more limited (e.g. no capture the flag), our hats go off to the development team for going the extra mile to include it.  Sadly, the same excessively simplistic gameplay that hampered the single-player portion is also a problem when shooting it out with a few friends via the link cable.  If you're hooked by what Jazz Jackrabbit has to offer when you play alone, then these extra multiplayer modes will be a worthwhile diversion -- but the rest of us will probably loose interest long before we can get our money's worth.You could do a lot worse for your platforming dollars than Jazz Jackrabbit.  It's a quality product that plays smoothly and even sports a few multiplayer modes on the side to help keep the replay value alive.  But while Jazz is a nice title to watch, it's much less entertaining to actually play.  The extremely basic controls and simplistic level design combine to produce a standard and quick-lived platforming action title that some gamers are sure to enjoy, while others will surely loose interest.  Unless you're a hardcore Jazz fan or haven't yet invested in other killer platformers such as Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3, then keep your expectations in check as you check this one out.", "date": "Dec 23, 2002"}
