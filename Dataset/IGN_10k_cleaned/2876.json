Basically a distilled version of the old SNES or Genesis version of the popular series, GBA Madden is a simplified version of its larger, more complex console brethren. Is it inferior to those titles? Of course it is. Is it fun? Of course it is. Whether you play it out of nostalgia or convenience (it's hard dragging an Xbox on the plane, after all), play it. Madden NFL 2003 is the best handheld football game around period (all respect to the Mattel's Classic Football).  Features All 32 NFL teams and players, and new divisions 150 offensive and defensive plays Create-a-player, exhibition, and season modes Link cable support for four players Cartridge save Only for Game Boy Advance   Last year was the first time Madden made an appearance on the GBA, and that game was reminiscent of  the old 16-bit football games in terms of look and gameplay. This year's outing is a similar experience. The game has been updated with new rosters, the Houston Texans and the realignment of divisions. In addition, there's been some stuff added to the Season mode, including trades and the ability to create a player.  The new Create-a-Player feature is excellent. Once you set up your player's physical particulars, you must enter the athlete into a scouting combine, where his skills are tested. Do well on the combine, and you player will be loaded in the stats department. Do a sub-par job in the mini-games, and you'll have an unskilled player. I like the mini-game approach to setting player stats, because it gives you a stake in how your athlete is going to turn out. In addition, the mini-games are varied enough to provide a fun diversion from the main game.  The addition of player trades is also nice. It's the most rudimentary of trading models, but the fact that it's in the game is great. Of course, none of this stuff was in last year's game, so it's a serious step up in terms of depth and longevity.  Let's face it. A handheld football game is not going to fool you into thinking it's deep. It's basically arcade-style football, with game scores typically in the 60-50 range. If you played last year's version of the game, very little has been changed in the gameplay department.  The controls are still simple, but great. Everything that's good about the console controls has been boiled down for use on the GBA. Everything is intuitive and responsive. This year, the passing has been reduced to a single button press for the snap (hike the ball and you're ready to pass, unlike last year's two-press passing call-up). This is a good tweak, as it allows for a faster passing attack.  The passing sytem works a lot better than running. On such a small format, it's tough to capture the complex line mechanics, cutting, etc. It's basically four yards in a cloud of dust, hoping to hit a hole and lurch forward for a few yards. The fact that the passing game is so dominant makes for high scores and some lack of depth in the gameplay realm.  The passing game is easy to exploit for long gains, as the defensive backs seem to hover pretty close to the line of scrimmage. Even in deep coverage situations, your receivers will routinely burn the defensive backfield for big gains. One thing that would seriously help the passing game is the ability to catch/pick off tipped balls. Currently, whenever a ball is tipped, it will flutter incomplete no matter who is the area. Simply adding the ability to pull down a tipped ball would make for a much better passing game.  The play books are really extensive, although they haven't changed much from last year's effort. There is a lot to choose from here, almost as many plays that exist in the console game. However, there isn't the diversity between teams that you might expect to see. Still, the playbooks offer a lot, from halfback passes to short yardage HB blasts, to hail marys.   All of its problems considered, Madden is still a ton of fun to play. Schooling the NFL on the go is great, and this one allows you to take on a buddy with link play as well. That, added to the fact that the season and create-a-player has been more fleshed out, adds up to pure handheld football goodness.    Like the 16-bit games, this Madden adopts a slightly tilted top-down view. The camera is positioned above the line and the action moves from south to north. For the most part, this system works well. Since the field is angled, player models have to change sizes as they get closer and further from the camera. For the most part, there is a smooth transition between the sizes. The game tends to chop up a bit when there's a lot of stuff happening on the screen, but that's almost to be expected.   The player models themselves look decent, considering the limitations. The animations are pretty bare bones, but the ones that are there look good. Bottom line, it would difficult to get truly realistic-looking football on the GBA, but this looks super for what it is.  This year's edition features the vocal stylings of John Madden and Al Michaels, the Monday Night Football crew. Madden's main contributions are the ~ouch~ and ~boom~ sound effects that accompany touchdowns. Michaels voices things like ~first down,~ ~touchdown,~ etc. They aren't used a whole lot, but the samples add a little more realism to the experience.  As for ambient noise, the crowds sound good for a handheld game, and so do the sounds of gameplay. You can actually hear the grunt of the line and the clash of pads. The whistle is the only thing that can get a bit grating (and cause the person next to you on the plane to ~turn that down~).  One last thing: every time you're at the menu, you can hear Andrew W.K.'s anthem ~Party Hard.~ The music is pretty distorted and compressed, but if you absolutely, positively need a nu-metal/hair metal/butt rock fix in the middle of the day, you can just turn on your GBA with the Madden cartridge loaded, and you'll be set.This is simply the best football offering available on a handheld. If you know and love the old SNES or Genny Madden, this is the game for you. The expanded season mode and link-up play will keep you busy on a plane, in the hotel room, at the dinner table, etc. It's simple, arcade-style football, but it's fun.", "date": "Aug 26, 2002"}
