A sit-down arcade game with a heavy-duty cockpit linked up to a second, Sega's fast-paced action game pitted specialized mechs against each other in a fight-to-the-finish duel. It featured twin sticks to pilot your Virtuaroids (~VRs~), and the mixture of close and long-distance combat blended into a far heavier strategy-action experience than most people initially realized.   In terms of game design, it basically added a third dimension to the reigning king at the time, Cyber Sled, plus cool ~Virtuaroids~ with Saturns Strapped to their backs. But that's just too simplistic a comparison, though it was often made at the time. A small but loud passionate group of diehard fans have fallen in love with the game's authenticity, mech design and overall finish, but the game in its various North American versions has generally failed to gain a larger audience. Which is why Virtual-on Marz, in concept, makes perfect sense. In reality, I'm still scratching my head over what happened to this disappointment of a title.   Gameplay  Virtual-on Marz is more or less the third North American version in the Sega series, depending on which systems you're counting (arcade or home system), following the first Virtual-On (arcade, Saturn), and the second, Virtual On: Oratorio Tangram (arcade, Dreamcast). In 2001, Sega AM3 handed the responsibilities of the VO series to Hitmaker, a more than competent developer (Sega Sports Tennis, Crazy Taxi) that's essentially taken a pure two-player game and has tried, methinks mostly in vain, to give it a single-player element.   The story is neither terribly interesting nor compelling, but somehow garners enough interest -- the lowest possible amounts -- to keep players' eyes on screen. The story, in brief, follows the Limited War, an industrialized combat performance that takes place on Mars, which has become the battleground theater for VR combat for the masses. The battles have drawn incredible attention, both good and bad: Corporate crime has sprung up like wildfire on the red planet as a result of the widespread popularity, and a specialized task force MARZ was created to handle all illegal activities.    The story unfolds in Dramatic mode, basically the story mode, and in it players learn the basics, starting off with a standard VR. It's the core of the game because the story, as dull and sleepy as it is, reveals new arenas, a healthy variety of spectacularly designed VR enemies, and the bulk of the 40 unlockable VRs. The single-player game is meaty and long, giving VO fans a deep if not repetitive string of missions, most involving you alone, but many involving team battles (including a guy named ~SGT. Hatter,~ who naturally wears a Smokey the Bear Ranger hat). There is, tragically, a Transformer crossover here, as the characters say things like ~Yeah! Rock on!~ and ~Go get 'em!~ in that all too familiar Saturday morning TV style of pandering. Still, despite Hitamker's best effort to prevent you from liking it, one can enjoy the remnants of the core Virtual-On gameplay.     Hitmaker, however, has tried in earnest to provide gamers with the semblance of twin stick gameplay. While there is no direct peripheral to accompany the game, the controller options are numerous and include two ~Twin Stick~ set-ups. Honestly, while it's a nice try, it's nowhere nearly the experience the arcade unit provides, and so it just feels like a cheap imitation.    Beginners can get going with the automatic setup, which is decent and functional. There are also Type A and Type B, and for those who like to customize, there is an Edit page. My strong recommendation is to pick one and get good at it. Don't switch in mid-game like I did. It doesn't work so well. Heh...   The game's other modes include Challenge, essentially a Survival mode including an AI partner. In many ways this mode is better than Story because the tension of straight battles, unencumbered by loading screens and terribly paced story-telling, gets to the point (lots of head-to-head battles).    Then, there is Versus, the core of the series' existence. If nothing else, VO is all about arcade-style mech combat against real people. Versus delivers something like that, and fans will at best, if they're willful and resolute about their Virtual-On,  endure this experience. Versus would be better, in fact the whole game would be better, if the controls, camera and flow of the VRs was better. A tall order, but one very much needed.      Yes, after about six or so years of Virtual-On's existence, Virtual-On Marz appears to have brought the series to its lowest point yet on this front. I'm not sure how, but the controls are fudged. The response time is like a frog crawling though glue, a weasel on pot swimming through quicksand, a Big Mac being pushed through a sieve...in slow motion...in Bullet Time...with a bad framerate...in space...backward. If anything, Virtual-On is supposed to be a quick-paced, fast-action experience. At the very least, this is what it's meant to be. Virtual-On Marz strips the game of this feeling, this notion, retaining only a hint of the original's flavor, speed, control and terse battle vibe. Additionally, nothing about these arenas denote level design that in any way improves the basic VO gameplay.    To complement this fault, the camera system is not as good as other VOs, and in my opinion, needs a complete overhaul altogether. It sticks on solid objects, clips through objects, and generally does its best to get in the way. It's slow and cumbersome, almost non-working. It's designed peculiarly in the first place. Players must ascend into the air to target any enemy not in their direct sight, after which the camera turns in the right direction. Any VO player knows this. But with so many games improving on cameras in the last seven years, Virtual-On Marz is still very much stuck in 1996. Some players might have ~gotten used to it~ but compared to, say, the brilliant camera in Zone of the Enders, another mech-style game, it's all but broken.   To complete the rant, whereas Dennou Senki Virtual On Force was the first game of the series to bring in four-player bouts, Virtual-On Marz is neither four-player, online, iLINK compatible or anything else. It's a one- to two-player game apparently stripped down or, more to the point, lobotomized, for the purpose of creating a single-player experience. This game is perfectly fit for online play, either two- or four, and though the variety of other problems prevents it from being much fun, this addition would have aided in its cause.   There are still likeable remnants of Virtual-On Marz. The move list of still serviceable. There is the Aerial Dash, Jump Attack, Dash Attack, Auto Forward Dash Attack, Close Range Attack, Quick Step Attack, Close Range Dash Attack, Close Range Upper Attack, and a nice strafe enabling players to slip around an enemy rearing up for an attack. Combat still works best at close and far ranges, though it seems like the game had reached a sort of mid-range zone, peculiar to the series. Likewise, the assortment of enemy VRs is intriguing. I've never been an Otaku on this front, but I do appreciate the VRs in all of their bizarre ornamental detail. And this game is filled with 40 of them, all for the pure goal of piloting and collecting.    Graphics  Despite the game's erratic framerate, camera clipping, loose, sloppy graphics, long load times (for every menu!), regular slowdown and poor blurring effects, multiple seams (wait, shall I really go on?), hardcore fans of the series shouldn't be entirely disappointed. We are talking 40 Virturoids  here.    The range of VRs is wild, starting with the basic warrior combat model to amazingly ornamented metal creatures of wonder. I remember on the first arcade unit playing like 10 or so. Forty seems like a treasure chest of VRs to pilot. On the other hand, I know a guy who has loved this series as much as anyone, and he strongly believes that most of these VRs in VO: Marz look more like finely crafted Asics shoes. Ouch. I can see his point though. At the same time they're wonderfully detailed, they're blocky, clunky and in some cases, just plain ugly. Depends on your point of view.   While the VRs might grab your eyes, the backgrounds are so ordinary and, in some cases, just plain dull, that it's just a curiosity. It's not like these backgrounds are causing the framerates to sag. They're plainly textured, plain colored and drive attention away from them. Not that VO: Marz requires intricate tapestries or Roman architecture, but something, anything would be an improvement over these sleepy backgrounds.    Sound  What amazes me throughout this game is, with a core fan base or people who absolute love this game, how Hitmaker has seemingly gone out of its way to try to put you to sleep. The narrator appears to be drugged in the worst way, with barbiturates and PCP; it's as if he is trying to put even himself to sleep. The narrator must have crept out of a crypt to give his last effort. I realize it's an ~effect,~ having a computerized tonal quality that makes things seem futuristic. But honestly, it doesn't work.   Styled entirely after the most eccentric of Japanese tastes, the music is at times cheesy, calming and incredibly opposite of what one would expect to hear with giant war-robots engaging in power battles. Yes, I am relieved it's not comprised of bad heavy metal or rerun songs from Saliva, but it is also incredibly sleepy in taste and range.I will admit there are far more addicted Virtual-On fans on the planet than myself. But over the years I have enjoyed just as much as anyone diving into a heated match and getting sucked in to it. This game is playable, it's functional, but only for the most diehard of Virtual-On fans. I really have nothing left to say but golly, the potential of this game is so strong, has always been strong. Until it can become a deeper two-player or four-player online game with a dedicated twin stick peripheral (a cost most publishers naturally abhore), there is no good logical reason to buy this huge disappointment. We know both Hitmaker and Sega can do better.", "date": "Oct 21, 2003"}
