But at the time it was due for release, Midway's big hitter Mortal Kombat 4 was already going strong. So instead of competing against itself, the company stopped the arcade development and moved it to the home market. At least that's the story that Midway is giving us.  It's pretty easy to see that fighting games are in a rut. Sure, there have been some tweaks and evolutions in the genre since Street Fighter II exploded onto the scene, but designers just can't seem to break away from the formula -- you know, that side-scrolling, jump-in-and-kick gameplay that's ruled in every single fighter from the beginning. . And even when the genre has turned more towards 3D, designers continue to restrict the action along a side-to-side plane. There's nothing entirely wrong with it, just that the genre could use a new innovation or two.  Midway's Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. is an ambitious attempt to break the mold that has controlled the fighting genre for almost 10 years. All right, the game features yummy gratuitous violence where you can hack off the limbs of your opponents, but the main draw in this fighter is the complete freedom of movement. In this 3D fighter you utilize the entire arena, not just a small portion of the floor. Since all of the eight futuristic fighters have a jetpack of sorts, the battles can take to the air and small platforms strategically placed high above the game field. Everybody has a distance weapon as well, moving the game out of the usual up-close-and-personal action. There are even hazardous pitfalls that can instantly end the match at any moment.  Problem is, all these new elements muck up the gameplay with confusing action, unbalanced character abilities, and control that just doesn't work on the standard control pad. The only thing this game has going for it is an incredibly fast and detailed 3D engine, which is the reason why it requires a 3D accelerator. But as we all know, great graphics don't necessarily make a great game.  The only reason to pick up Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. is if you're adamant about owning every fighter that's released on the PC -- not a difficult task, that's for sure. It's nice to see Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. injected some originality into the genre, but in the end too much of it wasn't a good thing. -- Craig Harris", "date": "Aug 14, 1998"}
