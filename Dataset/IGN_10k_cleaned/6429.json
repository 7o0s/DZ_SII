Following on the heels of fare like Glimmerati and System Rush, One is another polished title that will see an unfortunate lack of attention. But should you be one of the few owners on this side of the pond walking around with a QD (and I hope you proudly do so), it's highly recommend you check out this superlative game. Once you get the controls down, you'll be hooked. Left hooked.   At the onset of One, players are charged with creating an in-game avatar. The create-a-bruiser feature isn't just a quickie gimmick -- the customization options betray some real thought into the design of the feature. You can choose everything from gender to outfit, choosing to make a fighter that looks like your carbon-based husk, or some wickedly lithe beatdown specialist. World's your oyster on this one, pal.   However, your initial move set is lacking. In order to beef up your repository of butt-whupping tactics, you must take on a series of challengers in the game's single-player mode. The story mode reveals the trials and tribulations of fighters trying to become the titular One, the undisputed king of the brawlers. Most fights play out in one-on-one combat, but stages can throw a few opponents at you. Besting these fighters can take time -- and more than a few do-overs due to flagging health. As you get new moves, though, the stages become a little easier... at least, until tougher fighters come into play.   The fighting is not as deep as, say, Virtua Fighter 4, but it certainly rivals some of the flashier brawlers out there, like Soul Calibur. You must learn how to properly switch between three different fighting stances, as they affect the way you move. Employ the offensive stance to deliver more hearty thrashings, but you find yourself more vulnerable to damage. Back into a defensive pose, and you can deflect more chops. This is a great way to add depth to an already impressive move set. Fighter fans that really like to dig in and master moves will find hours of enjoyment here, just mastering using moves with different stances.   One uses a system of points to determine your ranking. ELO points are earned in both single-player games and multiplayer matches over Bluetooth. Using the Arena, One players can upload their point totals to see where they standing on a global chart. Finding other fighters to play against via Bluetooth to earn ELO points is a neat feature, but I wonder how practical it is due to the QD's lack of penetration.   One is one of the N-gage's better-looking games, and not just because of the nicely detailed fighter models or the colorful backdrops. The animations are silky smooth thanks to motion-capture tech and flow into each other quite well. It's hard to appreciate this unless you are watching somebody else fight. The game is flanked by some good music and excellent chopping and kicking sounds.  One is another good game for the N-Gage that I'm afraid few will play. It's sad, because at this point, Nokia is just being punished for early mistakes and so few people want to give the N-Gage a chance anymore. They're missing out on games like this, which have solid depth and play value -- I enjoyed One more than some PSP games. If you have the system, seriously consider seeking out a copy of One. It's further proof that the N-Gage, like the PS2 or Xbox, got better with age.", "date": "Nov 28, 2005"}
