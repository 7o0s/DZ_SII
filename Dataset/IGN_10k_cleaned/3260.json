The developer, Saffire, at least made the attempt at bringing a little of what makes Hot Wheels cool to the handheld, with its huge car collection, as well as its wild corkscrews and jumps in the game's many different tracks. But the overall production is a little too sloppy to ignore; weird collision detection, a clunky scrolling engine, strange computer AI and a lack of multiplayer make this a barely average racing affair on the handheld. Features More than 30 cars 12 character cards Password save Only for Game Boy Advance  In Hot Wheels Velocity X, we've got an isometric racing engine similar to titles like RC Pro Am. In the game, players assume the role of this robot named ~Gear Head~ (which sounds like an insult, but no, it's his real name). Apparently and unfortunately, prototype racing parts have been stolen by rival members of criminal gangs, and it's up to our pal Gear Head to race through the ranks to get them all back. It's an extensive challenge, since players will have to go through more than thirty different challenges to get all the parts back.   Okay, the story's kind of stupid, but it's how players collect all the extras in the game. See, as players win races, they'll earn faster and better cars. But to win the challenges, they'll have to accomplish certain tasks. Most challenges are two or three laps around a race track against computer drones...but that's not all. Some levels feature free-roaming vehicle combat levels, while others put players in the role of a delivery boy as they carry dangerous items from one part of the level to another without getting hit by computer drones. As far as racing variety goes, Sapphire included a lot. Unfortunately, the racing engine and design can't keep up with what the developers set out to do.   By default, the designers make players use a terrible control scheme that claims to be ~Beginner~, but it just doesn't make sense for a racing game; in this option, the car will move in the direction players push on the D-pad. Luckily the mode can be changed in the options menu to the standard ~clockwise/counter-clockwise~ control scheme, but since the game doesn't have a cartridge save this option...so players will have to remember to switch back to this mode every time they want to reboot the game.  But it's the technical issues that really hinder the enjoyment of Hot Wheels Velocity X. Computer AI drones flipflop between super-intelligent and dumb-as-a-post...trailing vehicles will seem to suck at your exhaust with masterful driving, no matter how well you seem to do. But every once in a while these guys will pull a 180 degree turn for no apparent reason. Collisions are also a problem, especially in the game's loops and corkscrews...when entering one of these stunt roads, the game clumps closely-driving cars together and sends them through a pre-determined animation, turning off the collision detection while the cars overlap each other and zoom through the stunt. But when they come out...wham! The collision detection turns back on and the cars come to a near halt. And with all the different driving modes in the game, it's a real drag to discover that the game does not support link cable for multiplayer racing or combat modes. This is a single-player affair.  The graphics are average fare on the GBA screen; it's understandable that the cars themselves lack any real detail, considering how many the developer managed to cram onto the cartridge. The sprites have some bad outlines that become apparent the darker the terrain becomes, and the background engine frequently sputters during the scroll...it's just not a clean looking racer. Not that I was expecting huge things from a Hot Wheels game, but the cons definitely outweigh the pros here. Variety is definitely the best thing about the game, as is the amount of time it will take to uncover everything...but it's hard to enjoy it when the racer plays so sloppily. A couple more weeks of gameplay tweaks would have definitely helped this title.", "date": "Nov 22, 2002"}
