Even the smallest screen is enlisting for duty, marked by this week's release of Gameloft's Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood. Based on the recently released console and PC game of the same name, you are a grunt doing his part in the Big One. If it's action you seek for your mobile gaming experience, Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood might be right your your proverbial alley.   As a one-man army, you must survive the treacherous run up the beaches of Normandy and then begin a full-frontal assault on the entire damn German war machine. It's preposterous and over-the-top, but that's video gaming for you. With rifles, machineguns, bazookas, and grenades, you will drop more German soldiers than Patton's 3rd Army, aiming every which way but loose with the number pad. You must determine which is the best weapon for the job, such as using grenades to clear out machinegun nests and bunkers. A flamethrower is great for roasting entire platoons of Nazi thugs. If you grew up playing classic action games like Capcom's Commando, then you definitely know what to expect here.   Most of the game is spent on foot, with you shooting up the scene with great abandon. Bullets travel slow enough that you can side-step them with relative ease, but sometimes the screen fills up with enemy fire if you don't eliminate the Nazis soon enough. Your grunt must have on some sort of super armor, though, as you can take quite a few shots before dropping. You can also pick up power-ups from crates, such as flame thrower fuel, bazookas, and extra grenades.   After playing a little while, you may wonder when the ~brother~ part of the title will kick in. There are missions where you finally do team up with other soldiers and must escort them to safety, burning through clip after clip to wipe out Nazi baddies together.   From time to time, you can climb into a tanks and really raze the roof. Flattening soldiers beneath your tank treads is a delicious guilty pleasure, should they actually survive long enough against the incessant machinegun fire that erupts from the vehicle. You can use number keys to rotate the tank's cannon and lob explosive shells at Nazi positions. These are arguably the best parts of a fairly entertaining game.   Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood includes a slight RPG element that isn't very fleshed out. As you play, you level up and earn additional health -- but this system could have been better implemented. Perhaps replaying the game could have somehow been tied in to the whole stat-building element? Without an obvious use for the system, it just feels tacked on. And that's odd to see in a Gameloft game.   I know that Gameloft wasn't exactly going for realism here, and the sprites are indeed detailed, but the somewhat cartoonish look of the game just did not work for me. I've played quite a bit of the console game this is associated with, and the difference is appearance is a definite cause for disconnect. I was reminded of the SNK Metal Slug franchise from time to time. The music and sound effects are quite good.   Before heading into the closing comments section, I just have to point out that Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood is not a terribly long game. I don't necessarily expect epic shooters on mobile, but Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood is over far too soon.  Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood is a fast-paced action game set in the always popular World War II. But being so fast and with such brief levels, Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood is over before it almost has any right to be. There's maybe an hour or so of game play in here, and while that's good enough for some people, I want to little more out of something that's gonna pad my already beefy cellphone bill. Just take that into consideration before enlisting in Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood, which is, as always, a quality Gameloft production.", "date": "Oct 15, 2005"}
