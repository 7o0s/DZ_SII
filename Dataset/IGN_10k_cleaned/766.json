A thinly plotted sequel designed to wow its audience with hip music and stylistic visuals.  Enter the PlayStation counterpart from Acclaim.  I am usually leery of film licensed games - they are almost always rushed product constrained by un-bending schedules hoping to sell on name and concept alone.  City of Angels is certainly not going to break any molds in this area.  What could have been a simple but fun action/fighting game instead becomes the textbook for how to make a bad video game.      The game follows the basic plot of the movie.  You, as Ashe, have been killed by nefarious criminal types for no reason.  The spiritual power of the crow brings you back from the dead to reap vengeance on those who have wronged you.  You move through a 3-D, fixed camera environment as various bad people (can you say nin-jitsu death bitch!) attack you a few at a time.  The control is extremely slow and clunky - you will get frustrated quick trying to move and line up properly in multiple fights.  The camera has been fixed in one pre-determined place in each room/environment which leaves Ashe behind poles, people, you name it - while you attempt to fight.  The environment itself is, at best, minimally interactive and confusing (crow arrows appear throughout the game on the floor to 'guide' you, but it doesn't really help.)  Oh yeah, I almost forgot the annoying load time which occurs after every room.      The graphics aren't bad.  A dark, gritty atmosphere is created that gives the game a strong mood, with everything lit in eerie reds and yellows.  However, the attempt to work in the Mature elements doesn't quite work.  Expect muffled cursing (what did he say?) and the occasional leather bikini that will probably have you laughing out loud.      The gameplay just isn't happening and without that City of Angels is sunk before it leaves the dock.  Leave this one for the crows.", "date": "Mar 12, 1997"}
