Of course, it's up to the publishers and developers to create something that's legitimately compelling and not just another cog in the studio's marketing machine. Disney and developer Capybara have something here that falls right in the middle.   At World's End is based on the third film in the pop culture phenom of a trilogy. Will Turner and his cohorts must rescue Jack Sparrow from a purgatory of sorts so that can take the fight back to Davy Jones and his new master, Lord Becket. As such, you begin the game as Turner, seeking the help of a pirate lord in Singapore. The first two levels are something of tutorials, teaching you the ins and outs of the controls. At World's End is largely a platformer with lots of running, jumping, and collecting. There are pirate enemies to do battle with, too. Turner and Sparrow (no secret that he's resurrected) engage in a little swashbuckling on two levels -- basic combat in the context of platforming and duels with bosses that require parrying, feinting, and slashing.   Capybara does seek to mix things up in the game's 21 levels (which is an impressive number for mobile), such as adding ship battles and escape scenes. In a ship battle, you must aim your cannon at the opposing ship's guns as well as blast their cannonballs out of the air. Successive hits release power-ups, like a triple shot. Unfortunately, these battles aren't very exciting. You also have scenes where you must fend of a horde of incoming enemies, but your enjoyment of this is directly related to how much you enjoy pounding on attack buttons.   Like Capybara's incredibly cute and playable Happy Feet, there is a certain emphasis on collection. You must crack open crates and defeat enemies to recover gold doubloons. Each level also has a set number of treasure chests that need to be unlocked. The game charts your collecting, tallies scores at the end of levels, and awards mini-games if you manage to swipe enough booty. How you feel about collecting will have an effect on how much you like At World's End. For example, I don't mind it as long as it's reasonable, but do get frustrated when I reach the end of a stage with only 99-percent of the gold coins after defeating every enemy and braking open every chest.   Two things about At World's End serve as buzzkills. First, the control is questionable. I tested the game on a Sony Ericsson w810i and an LG CU500. Both handsets have responsive directional pads and buttons. But hitting landings, making jumps, and especially swinging on vines was a purely hit-or-miss operation. Pulling off a double-jump seemed more random than anything -- sometimes I'd reach the rigging, sometimes I'd be pounding on the jump button (2 or up) to no avail.   Secondly, there isn't much pizzazz in here. The game looks okay and it manages to squeeze in plenty of stuff from the movie, but it lacks the flair that packs 'em in the theaters. If you have a chance, check out Gameloft's Pirates of the Seven Seas and you'll get an idea if what I mean -- there's an over-the-top pirate adventure with frilly shirts, flamboyant moves, and beautiful scenery. At World's End just isn't inventive -- it's a textbook side-scrolling movie game, and after playing games with loftier ambitions like Warner's 300 or Capybara's own Cars, it's hard to settle for the routine.   Developer Capybara Games has assembled a perfunctory movie-game that hits its marks -- swashbuckling, cannon fire, vine swinging -- but fails to engage the player at all. That the game play isn't compelling (a problem augmented by iffy control) is a shame, because with no fewer than 21 levels, this could have been a real value for mobile gamers. If you're looking for a great pirate-themed game to compliment your interest in the summer spectacle, I recommend Gameloft's Pirates of the Seven Seas.", "date": "May 25, 2007"}
