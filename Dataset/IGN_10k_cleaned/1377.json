It's not really any of these. In fact, it's not really a game. At least, strictly speaking anyway. What Aquanaut's Holiday is, however, is a fun and immersive 3D underwater sim of the most relaxing kind.  You're plopped into the oceans of the world, with freedom of motion to go where ever you like. Along the way you establish underwater stations, build corral reefs, and pretty much just explore. Seen from a first person perspective, Aquanaut's Holiday exotic sea life and realistic landscapes soon have you believing you really are exploring the bottom of the ocean. Whether this will be enough to capture the attention of most gamers weaned on fast action remains to be seen. As it stands though, Aquanaut's Holiday is an engaging and very special game.", "date": "Nov 22, 1996"}
