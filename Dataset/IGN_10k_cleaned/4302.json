In others, it's the worst. The game offers the most realistically paced NBA game on the market, and improvements in the low post and computer AI are big plusses, while the addition of XSN Sports to the lineup also provides the title a nice boost. Unfortunately, the lack of dribble moves, animations, poor sound, and Clipper-esque graphics work against the series and keep it from ultimately capturing the title.   Still, even with its flaws, Inside Drive might be the game of choice for basketball fans looking for a more sim-like experience, even if sim in this case is at the cost of overall fun.   The GameInside Drive shine in terms of its subtleties, small little touches that hard-core basketball fans will applaud while gamers just looking for a quick dunk will totally miss, or might not even care about it in the first place. Things like a shooting guard running around picks through the lane, then spotting open for the three-pointer ala the legendary battles of Reggie Miller and John Starks. Players down low tipping rebounds to themselves and even diving out of bounds to save a loose ball. Winded big men struggling up court, looking like they're going to collapse as the offense blows right on by. Players jumping up off the bench when it's time to sub. Like I said, these are little things that the NBA crowd will appreciate, but the average gamer might not even pick up on if they only play a few games. But the more you play Inside Drive, the more subtleties you uncover, and the more you appreciate the depths of NBA realism the developers dove into.    Inside Drive represents the NBA so well, I'm surprised members of the Blazers don't get arrested between games.   Seriously, though, the game represents the true pacing of the NBA, almost to a fault. It really comes down to what type of game you're looking for. If you're looking for in-your-face dunks and show-stopping blocks, this isn't your game. If you're looking for players dribbling the ball up court, running plays, and dishing the rock down low into the post to pull off moves so slick you'd find them in Hakeem's dreams, then you should look the way of Inside Drive.     Then again, for a game that captures of the NBA so perfectly, it isn't without its faults. Matt Harpring led the NBA in PPG in one simulated season, averaging 33.0 per game. And while the variety of post shakes and hooks down in the post add a lot to the gameplay, the moves are almost too powerful, especially when you have a bunch of sucker centers in the league all playing like their names are Shaq or Duncan. There also seem to be occasional glitches when trying to call plays. On multiple occasions, my point guard dribbled down court, and as I hit the D-pad to call a play, it gave me my selection of defensive plays instead of offensive. The more this happens, the more frustrating it becomes, but it seems like if you back out of the play, then attempt to call another one, the glitch fixes itself. Too bad there's a shot clock ticking down and a defender in your face as you try to right the ship.   Another factor that holds the title back is the lack of options when playing through a season. Sure, you have the options to trade, release, sign, create, and draft players, but that's about it. All of the other basketball titles have put time and resources into building a Franchise or Dynasty mode that enables you to train players, hire assistants, and so on, Inside Drive offers none of this. So again, while the gameplay itself is pretty tight, the game is not for everyone, especially with the lack of options to keep you coming back into your role of General Manager.     The thing is, while Inside Drive lacks the depth offline, Microsoft is banking that you're only playing offline in order to improve your game for your XSN Sports league. The online experience enables you and your friends to create your own NBA, and even tracks the stats for you. Unfortunately, if you take the court against people outside of your own clique, you might find some problems. It seems any time you take a lead, the losers on the other end try to get you to mutually quit the game. You decline, they ask again. Decline, they ask again. It becomes very annoying. Just as annoying are all of the people cherry picking, leaving one player under their basket as you run up court the other way. This isn't necessarily the game's fault, but people are trying to take advantage of the way the game is set up, and so the experience of playing online is really a mixed bag. Fun with friends, but beware the general public.     GraphicsESPN NBA Basketball has done such a remarkable job of capturing the look of the NBA, from the faces to the tats, that everything else just looks ugly in comparison. To make matter worse, when cycling through the players on your team in Inside Drive, you notice that you have a number of twins, as so many players look alike in the game, you'll think David Stern as perfected a cloning machine. There are also some extremely ugly player models. One look at Zydrunas Ilgauskas looks so freakishly like Frankenstein, you'll call timeouts just to look for the bolts on his neck.   The players themselves also lack the number of animations of the other games, and this is evident in everything from the opening tipoff, to the repetitive dribbles and spins. A little more variety, especially when it comes to individual player moves would be a big bonus when it comes to developing next year's game.     SoundDolby 5.1 captures the sound of the arena, but more chants, chatter and crowd noise is needed to sound like a real NBA game. Sometimes you feel like your fans are sitting on their hands a little too much, like every game is between the Orlando Tragic and the TerriBulls. I mean, when LeBron dips on somebody, I want the Cleveland fans to go nuts, not just give me polite applause.   The announce team of Kenny Smith, Kevin Calabro, and Marques Johnson are a little too happy to spew catch phrases instead of actually talking about the action on the court. There are really only so many times you want to hear the announcer shout ~Yahtzee!~ after a dunk, and actually my number is zero.Do I like Inside Drive? Yes. Does it have flaws? Yes. Do I want to keep playing it now that I'm finished with the review? Yes, very much so. There's just something to playing a realistically paced game, and Inside Drive does a fantastic job of capturing this. If you're looking for a dunk contest, go with Live. If you're looking for a deep game with fun extra modes, go with ESPN. But if what you're looking for is an accurate representation of true NBA Basketball, I'd buy Inside Drive in a heartbeat. The best part about it, even if you play a season as the Blazers, you won't have to waste your free agent money on bail.", "date": "Dec 6, 2003"}
