Follow-ups to existing titles need to justify the numerals placed on their packages, by offering new ideas and innovations. Fresh takes on established gameplay designs. Lost in Blue 2 has these  there just aren't enough of them. This title, a sequel to 2005's Lost in Blue from Konami, plays much too similarly to its predecessor. It feels more like a rehash than an evolution, and when it's hard to pin down just where the justification for that numeral ~2~ comes in, it's even harder to pin down a reason to pay cash money to own it.    It all started on the Game Boy Color, back in 1999. Then, near the end of that year, Konami published a quaint, simple sleeper hit of a game called Survival Kids. The concept was inspired  you're a child lost at sea, washed up on a desert island, and it's up to you to keep yourself alive long enough for help to arrive. Survival was open-ended. You were free to do what you wanted, when you wanted, so long as you kept yourself from starving from death.    Lost in Blue followed the same formula. As a spiritual sequel to Survival Kids, Lost in Blue sought to update the island survival concept with 3D visuals and DS-exclusive gameplay additions that used the touch screen and microphone. The game found an audience in 2005, but not as large a one as it could have  the menial aspects of keeping your characters fed and rested cut into the fun of exploration.    This sequel should have fixed that. It doesn't. Lost in Blue 2 is now the third portable deserted island adventure to come from Konami, and rather than finding that the formula has evolved over the years, the reverse is true  each installment has been a step backwards instead. This time around, the monotony of keeping your characters alive is even more pronounced, and frustrating to the point that you'll likely choose to end the adventure yourself by way of the power switch, rather than any in-game attempt at rescue or escape.    It's the food, really. There are two characters in Lost in Blue 2, Jack and Amy, and each one is more insatiable than Pac-Man. Both protagonists have three meters displayed on the top screen  fatigue, thirst and hunger. And each of the three meters must be kept from hitting zero, otherwise the characters will start to lose hit points, and, ultimately, drop dead.      The food is the frustration because it's just never enough. The hunger, fatigue and thirst meters are constantly draining away to nothing, while you frantically search for anything edible. By the time you've gathered enough coconuts, mushrooms and seaweed to make a meal, and prepared the items in a cooking mini-game, and sat through the cutscene showing the characters eating together, it's just not enough. The energy regained by the food isn't even enough to replenish the amount expended to gather it all. It's a system of diminishing returns where, little by little, you're steadily marching to death's door. It's just not fun.    Now, eventually, things look up. You're able to fashion a spear to go fishing. You explore more of the island and stumble upon more wildlife, and more mini-games, and just more stuff to do. Unique to this edition is a stronger focus on cooking, and more intense first-person perspective encounters with dangerous animals. Spear-fighting an angry crocodile with your makeshift touch control javelin is pretty cool.    But, through it all, the tedium of managing you and your partner's overly rapid digestive systems never relents. You're always drawn back out of any fun you're having wrestling gators or exploring new parts of the island by the ever-present and ever-draining meters. Frustrating, too, is the lack of intelligence of your partner character. You can choose to be either the boy or girl at the adventure's onset, and the one you don't choose is immediately cursed with the brain of a duck. Worse than a duck, really  even a birdbrain would take a drink of water on its own if it were dying of thirst. Your Lost in Blue partner? Not so much. You'll have to literally hold his or her hand and guide them bodily to the river every time they're parched near the point of no return, otherwise they'll just curl up and croak right there in the comfort of your cohabitated cave.    The game offers a few extra modes beyond the single-player survival story. The first is a single-card multiplayer mode that lets you challenge up to three friends in a handful of the island's mini-games  competitive touch-controlled WiFi goat milking is unique, I'll give them that. The second is a more hardcore take on the primary quest called Serious Survival. This unlockable mode is morbid, and will always end in your character's death  it eliminates the partner kid and challenges you to survive on the island only by yourself. The isolation seems severe, but remembering that the partner was really just a braindead drain on your time and attention before, Serious Survival is actually a more inviting way to play in many ways. Lost in Blue 2 does do some things new, but it's just not enough. Its enhancements over its predecessor are walled off, barriered behind the roadblock of frustration in the hours of investment it takes to even get to them. The numeral doesn't justify itself, and so spending the cash to buy this title can't really be justified either. You'd be better served to just try out a copy of the original Lost in Blue, or, for an even better result, track down the first Survival Kids for Game Boy Color. The cartridge won't play on a Nintendo DS, but will on a Game Boy Advance SP. Konami got it right that first time, back in 1999. Since then, it's just been backwards steps.", "date": "Apr 4, 2007"}
