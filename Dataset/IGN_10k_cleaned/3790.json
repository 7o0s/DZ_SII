{"name": "Charlie's Angels", "name_review": "Charlie's Angels", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/07/16/charlies-angels", "text": "The new Charlie's Angels -- also known as Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore -- have taken the faded television series to new heights on the silver screen. Now with two movies (the second of which is set to earn some $100 million at the domestic box office) packed full of over-the-top fights and lots of scantily clad beautiful women, it's no wonder that publisher Ubi Soft has nabbed the license for videogame use.   But unfortunately, Charlie's Angels arrives for GameCube as the textbook example of what happens when no care or thought is put into the digital adaptations of lucrative movie licenses. It's a game that is every bit as shallow as the fluff movies it's based on, but unlike the film takes it doesn't have pretty girls and high-budgeted action sequences to fill in the gaps.  Features   Play as Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore's Charlie's Angels characters 3D beat-'em-up title Punch, kick, and throw your way to victory Pick up weapons and use them against groups of enemies FMV and in-game cut-scenes tell the story Requires four memory blocks for saves Single-player   Gameplay The lights go out in crowded New York City and when they turn back on, the Statue of Liberty is missing -- stolen. The crime is the latest in a series of high-profile robberies of such historical monuments as Arc de Trimophe, the Lincoln Memorial and the Stonehenge stones. It's up to the three beauties, Charlie's Angles, to travel the world in search of the mystery disappearances and capture the culprit behind them. The story is told through mildly intriguing FMV cut-scenes in which the goofy, loose humor of the movies is mimicked, but the girls themselves -- a little off-looking -- only faintly resemble their real-life counterparts, which is disappointing.  The game couldn't be more straightforward or uninspired. You play as one of or all three of the Charlie's Angels whose main objective is stumble through routine environments and fend off groups of the similar looking enemies. It's kind of like Final Fight, except in limited 3D and in our experience not as refined. The control system works, but it's is so basic that compared to today's far better games it feels inexcusably confined and outdated. The Angles can be manipulated about the environments, but they can only walk so far before they run directly into visible walls, which seem to pop up out of nowhere and surround every locale. An arrow on the lower screen shows you where to go next and sometimes it will lead the Angels directly to an object or barrier, like, say, a stairway, and if you're anything like us you'll spend a couple of minutes trying to climb the thing before you figure out and hurdle the mechanical boundaries to performing the seemingly simple action.   The bulk of the game revolves around fight after fight with enemy after enemy. Developer Neko Entertainment has tried to keep with the look and feel of the movies by introducing slow-motion effects and the occasional cinematic angle into the sequences, but the brawls and jumpy camera system or so malfunctioned that any sense of intuitiveness or polish is completely lost. The shallow selection of jittery fight moves, a thin list of punches and kicks with the occasional toss and a centimeter-deep combo system, deliver no degree of satisfaction and do little to heighten the experience. The end experience frankly feels more like an old 2D brawler with 3D graphics and it's all surrounded by unpolished presentation. No thank you.  Graphics We don't think that the curvy, voluptuous women of the Charlie's Angels films would be happy with their blocky, stiff, robot videogame adaptations. We're certainly not. They're not sexy, but rather almost sexless. The 3D models in this game lack detail on all fronts, from pure polygon counts to texture clarity, and this shows. The biggest offender by far though is the animation, or lack of it, we should say. The girls stutter about the worlds in the game, change directions on a whim, seem to have no weight or inertia, and generally just look dumb.    Meanwhile, the camera system is one of the worst we've seen in recent years, a real feat when we factor in that the environments being shot are so tiny and limited by invisible boundaries. If there's a bright spot here, it's that Charlie's Angels does at least run at a consistent framerate.  Sound If you're still reading, why must you torture yourself? We've established that this is not a good game. Move along. There is nothing to see here. Sadly, there's not much to hear, either. Like that transition? Come on, pretty good, no? While the FMV sequences are colored by the voices of the girls, and it all sounds pretty decent, most of the in-game audio work is too simplistic to list. For some reason, when the girls are kicked or punched by opponents, they let out retarded moans and by the time you've spent a half hour with the title, you've heard the same yelp 100 times or more. The music portions include cuts such as Get Free and Once Upon a time, some of the same tunes you've heard in the movie, but again most of the in-game work is so subtle that it's hardly noticed.Well, Ubi Soft still rocks, but Charlie's Angles most certainly does not. This game is, simply, bad, in just about every way, from the uncomplicated, dated control system to the limited play boundaries surrounded by invisible walls, the poor camera, and unsatisfying play mechanics and the sometimes-disturbing graphics. It's an overall shallow experience -- perhaps the one thing is shares in common with the movies -- but unlike the films it's neither sexy nor cool.Not recommended for anyone.
