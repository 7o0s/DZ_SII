Cooking Mama: Cook Off is effectively a port of the original DS title, made somewhat playable on Wii. However, to justify the full price tag, an international 'cook off' mode has been added to spice things up, so-to-speak. The basic premise is cute - learn to prepare 55 recipes by using the remote as your universal kitchen appliance - knife, grater, mallet, spoon, grinder, frying pan and so on. This replaces the DS' much more direct and precise stylus input, and it also spells the downfall of Cooking Mama and a real chink in the Wii's armour.   There are a good dozen or more different kitchen tools and techniques that the Wii remote emulates, but almost all are imprecise at best. At worst, they're seemingly random and can completely undermine your dish. The reason for this is that, like many Wii motion-recognition movements, the on-screen action is not in synch, one-to-one, with how you're manipulating the remote. With the exception of sliding a square of butter around a hot skillet or squirting mustard on a hotdog, all other mini-game food preparation steps are simulated incredibly poorly. Even something as simple as making several vertical or horizontal slices is an exercise in undue frustration.   Other mini-games, such as sifting a bag of flour or cracking an egg require a stupidly fine control of swing-speed. The line between an obliterated egg and an intact shell is so fine as to be indiscernible in any practical sense by the common man. Perhaps by an Iron Chef or Jamie Oliver, but not by us.   The motion mechanic for the simple act of pouring is one of the few that works well.  Why hasn't the developer (or Nintendo, even) stepped up and fine-tuned the controls? Surely adding more than two or three degrees of motion detection shouldn't be an issue. Even grating a piece of ginger - a left-right motion - is a precarious task. Factor in a quick up-down to dislodge accumulated ginger-bits (or, Cam-nads) on the underside of the grater, and you'll understand why we're frustrated.   There isn't a whole lot going on in Cooking Mama when you lift the lid. In fact, when stacking the original DS game against the Wii edition, the DS version had more dishes to prepare - 76, compared with the Wii's 55. For some reason, the Wii development team decided to pare this number down and instead increase the number of steps in creating each dish, almost like some kind of unholy trade-off. This the first of many stumbling points in Cooking Mama's recipe. By opting for more steps in each recipe, you end up having to complete mini-games that sometimes only require one or two movements on one vegetable or other edible produce. The pace is drawn out and the artificial complexity isn't fun - it's just filler.   The game's dishes can be blitzed through in several hours, but will take significantly longer to perfect - due almost entirely to the shoddy controls. Each step in the dish creation process is given a rating, ranging from the puzzling and vaguely insulting 'Try Hard' to 'Great'. Your accumulated points, calculated by combining your accuracy against the time it took to complete the stage, is totalled at the end of the dish and added to your ranking as a chef.     New to the Wii version as mentioned above, is the Friends and Food of the World. This is a head-to-head cook off against  AI controlled opponents from all over the culinary map. The Spanish-girl with her luscious mahogany locks makes paella, for instance, while the quirky Japanese character rolls sushi. It is in this mode that you can also earn token gifts and golden kitchen utensils with which to deck out your virtual Cooking Mama kitchen. Why? Why not. It has no bearing on your abilities, but we suppose it is something you could tout to your friends at your next afternoon of tea-and-scones or night of hard liquor. Or not.   The multiplayer Friends and Food mode is an equivalent experience, only with a human opponent - strictly offline, of course. The lack of Mii integration is a bit of a shame, however, and the controls are damning and random enough to make the experience kind of irritating; it's nowhere near as fun as an Iron Chef-style cook off could potentially be.   Graphics are plain and unspectacular. Unfortunately, the gameplay is too weak to excuse the 'stylish' cell-shading.  From one swing-and-a-miss to another - the graphics are shonky. It's one thing to employ cel-shading to a game in order to create a lush, cartoony world. It's another thing entirely to just be half-arsed about the whole thing. To be sure, Cooking Mama is fugly. We're talking Elephant-man or Sloth-from-The-Goonies ugly. Everything is polygon-depraved, suffering from texture bulimia or will cause you to contract a nasty bout of undercooked, art-directionless botulism.   The sound fares little better. The looping midi theme is grating and about on-par with the DS' instrumentation in terms of quality. In the Friends and Food of the World mode, each regional representative has a stereotypical theme that plays over the top of the match; they're more interesting than the theme music, but let's not go wild here. Yes, Cooking Mama is dreadfully average in the sound department, too.   The Japanese housewife loves to babble incoherently at your mess-ups and the 'engrish' she spouts is almost more entertaining than the core gameplay - hearing her shriek praise through a thick accent and a fractured translation is probably unhealthy for one's character as a human being, but it acts as a timely reminder of exactly how foreign a concept Cooking Mama really is. This is a game with mass-market aims, but controls and content that really hamper its appeal.   And that is pretty much that. For a semi-sequel that is arguably a large backwards step from the original game, Cooking Mama will leave a bitter taste in your mouth. It's a neat idea that definitely deserves a better team or larger budget should a sequel ever make its way to shelves. If anything, it makes us wonder if the Wii's emphasis on originality might be a dangerous proposition for mainstream gamers - gamers who might be pretty appalled by a title of this dubious quality. Nintendo seal or no, Cooking Mama needed longer in the oven and a few more ingredients.", "date": "May 18, 2007"}
