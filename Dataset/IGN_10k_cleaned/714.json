I never ~talk smack,~ I never gloat when I blow away my opposition. But it's really hard for me to review a game like Track & Field without mentioning the fact that, well, there's not many people who can beat me in any console version. It's just one of those facts of life -- when the original PlayStation version was released a few years back, I established myself early on as the fastest thumbs on the east. That's why I couldn't wait to wrap my digits around the Game Boy Color to see what Konami has done with its game series in portable form. While the game remains as faithful as ever to the original concept, the actual Game Boy system design is International Track & Field's weakness.  Features Ten events Career mode Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Color  Like the original Track & Field released in the arcade almost two decades ago, this Game Boy rendition features multiple events that test your ability to mash two action buttons as fast as you possibly can. In every one of the game's events, the faster you are hitting the A and B button in succession, the higher your on-screen character's power will rise. More power mean faster speed, further throws, and higher jumps. Ah, but more than that, it's also a game of timing and angles -- in some events, you'll have to time your jumps and judge the angles to get the best possible time or distance.  There are ten events in International Track & Field: 100 yard dash, long jump, high jump, javelin, discus throw, shot put, 110 hurdles, pole vault, and 400 and 1500 meter run. For those of you familiar only with the original arcade version of Track & Field, the last two events are unique to the new edition of the game and really stress how long you can keep up with the button pushing.  While you can go through the game's ten events in the arcade-style ~Hyper~ mode, the game's focus is the story mode where you take an athlete through a full decathlon career. Based on your performance in a single 100-yard dash, you build up a character through training, attend monthy three-event practices, and head into full-on competition until you establish yourself as the absolute champion. This mode is very extensive, and we're thankful the game features a battery back-up to save your progress.  The Game Boy system, unfortunately, isn't configured well for this type of game, but Konami made the effort. There's honestly no way to comfortably hold the system to mash the buttons and watch the screen at the same time. It's just impossible to hold the system in your hands, pressing the run buttons as well as the jump button without losing sight of what's on the screen. The best way I found to play the game is to rest the system on my knee and hold it with one hand -- with the other hand, I hold a Bic lighter or thick pen on its edge and quickly swipe it back and forth over the A and B buttons. The curved edge of the lighter or pen pushes the buttons down without it getting stuck -- unfortunately, you can never be sure if the utensil is actually pushing the button or rubbing just over it enough for button to not register a push. The other downside is that the friction of plastic on plastic will definitely put a bit of wear on the surface of the Game Boy buttons -- after a couple hours of playing this game, you can definitely see the scratches on the buttons.  The game looks better than it did in the arcades years ago, adding a cool looking behind-the-racer perspective in the 400 and 1500 meter challenges. I do miss the big-headed characters of the arcade, and in some cases I wish the game was simply a direct translation from the arcade. But that's only my nostalgia tastes coming through.  In game design, International Track & Field is very thorough and addicting. The game even features a link-cable mode so you can challenge a buddy in the ten events -- rock on! The game is just as exhausting as it has ever been -- maybe even more so this time. The real problem is ergonomics. Trying to figure out the best way to play the game was the greatest challenge of them all. I'd rather play International Track & Field on a console system, but for a portable version of the game I couldn't ask for more.", "date": "Feb 16, 2000"}
