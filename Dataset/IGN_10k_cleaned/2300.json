But what about Number 4? Wario Land 4 keeps a lot of what made Wario Land 3 great by recreating many of the clever design elements on the Game Boy Advance, while adding a handful of new twists to the franchise...tossing a bit of GBA hardware capabilities in there for good measure. The result is an equally fantastic adventure that shouldn't be missed on the handheld, even with its slightly awkward quirks peppered throughout the game. Features More than 20 stages Three mini-games Unlockable Sound Room Battery save (three slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  The reason why Wario is such a cool franchise is simple: it gives Nintendo the opportunity to make a not-so-nice platformer without really tarnishing its already established, cutsy characters. Wario is the company's bad-boy whenever the company feels the need to let off a little ~evil~ steam and venture into a grittier situation while still offering gameplay innovations that Nintendo's known for. In the case of Wario, it's all about raiding treasure-filled tombs and ~stealing~ every little shiny object in the area.  And while Wario Land 4 isn't that much different from his last adventure on the Game Boy Color, there's still a handful of really clever ideas in place. Remember kids, stealing and looting is bad. Wario is a trained professional.  In Wario Land 4, our ~hero~ has discovered a lost pyramid just brimming with treasure to grab. Once he's in, though, he's stuck...and he has to go to each of the chambers,  grabbing the key hidden deep inside that will unlock the door to the next level. You'll have to take control of this rotund character and snag the four hidden jewel pieces that will unlock the door to the boss level in each of the Pyramid's four sections. As soon as you've snagged the key, though, it's a race to the warp to get out of the chamber...if you don't beat the clock you'll lose your treasure and have to do it again.  I'm of the belief that good game design incorporates some sort of transparent training mode so that players can jump into the action without being lost in potentially complex controls. Wario Land 4 uses every button on the Game Boy Advance in different combinations with the control pad, so it's a really, really good thing that you're forced to go through the game's first level, even though it's nothing but a level that walks you through the game's techniques and goals.  Trust me, this beginner level is well thought out and still fun, even though all you're really doing is learning the basics, such as jumping, picking up items, throwing items, rolling down ledges, breaking walls, and other necessary skills.  The later levels in the game are laid out with a lot of thought to Wario's capabilities, including his ~alterations~ when an enemy knocks him around. If a monkey gets Wario with an apple, you might think that bloating up to a three-hundred pound blubber-butt might be a bad thing, but in several instances you'll have to use this new ~form~ to break through the floor with your weight. A bee-sting will inflate Wario with a nasty reaction, but it's the only way to float up to higher ledges. And when a mechanism hammers down on this guy's head, sure he's flattened like a pancake, but his slimmer physique makes it a snap to drift on the breeze into open gaps in the wall. The gameplay is all about learning how to use the enemies and their effects on Wario's body...and the designers put together some seriously well thought-out levels enveloping these techniques in their layouts.  Replay is a large focus in Wario Land 4 as the game hides many little items to uncover. For example, snag a hidden CD and you'll be able to listen to the background music in the game's Sound Room. Treasure that you've collected can be used in the game's three really, really basic mini-games such as a classic baseball homerun derby, a ~jump to avoid enemies~ action sequence, and a ~match the face~ challenge...none of these mini-games are anything special, but they will allow you to buy power-ups at the item shop that will assist in beating some of the harder bosses in the game.  The biggest change to the gameplay: Wario is vulnerable this time around. In his previous adventures, you could get this guy mauled, flattened, crunched, bonked, and whacked and he'd still be around for seconds, thirds, and fourths. This time around, an energy bar is in place -- Wario can still take his usual beating, but if he gets hurt once too much, he's thrust back out of the level and all of his earnings is lost. It's a lot more convenient than death, though, since there's no such thing as a ~Game Over~ screen in Wario Land 4. This element changes the way the game's played, since a bit more caution is necessary in grabbing all the needed items in each level.  It wouldn't be a Nintendo-published game if it didn't push the hardware, and it's true in this case. Wario Land 4 uses the GBA's sprite scaling and rotation effects and background transparency abilities with excellent, if subtle results. The music is also very clever...some tunes actually have vocals, and the background tunes get all warbly if Wario's not quite himself. But graphically, the game doesn't seem too far of a step beyond what the Wario team did on the Game Boy Color...sure, there's a bit more color going on in the GBA adventure, but the sprites are still simple pixel-art creations that animate similar to the last GBC game. That's far from a bad thing, of course, but I was expecting a little more of a leap in imagery beyond the sprite effects.  And while the controls are pretty spot-on,  trying to climb up or down a ladder in most of the levels is a bit more ~sticky~ than what people are used to in a Nintendo platformer. Players have to get Wario perfect against the ladder if they want to grab ahold of it.  And I actually screwed myself in one level by falling off a rotating platform, without any way of getting back up...yes, you can restart a level, but it's a real drag to do that since you lose all your items collected up to that point, and in this case this level design goof shouldn't have been there. Wario rocks -- there's a lot of variety in the game design and is more challenging than the usual side-scrolling fare due to its focus on making players figure out how to get to certain locations in the level. It's slightly similar to Klonoa in that respect, but Wario Land 4 puts a lot more emphasis on action. The slight control glitch at ladders is a bit of a drag, and the mini-games are more silly than they are fun to play. Wario Land 4 is also the first Nintendo GBA product without any link support...but I'm willing to look the other way on this fact since the single player adventure is so good.", "date": "Nov 21, 2001"}
