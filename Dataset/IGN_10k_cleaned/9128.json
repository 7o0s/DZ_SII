Awesome.   Perhaps the second most important element of a successful licensed game, after compelling game play, is nailing the essence of the source material. If Gameloft's new CSI: Miami was judged on only that facet, the game would score a perfect ten. All of lead CSI Horatio's smarmy dialogue tics, the mommy talk of Alexx the coroner to the victims, and Calleigh's cool condescension pervade every single corner of this crime scene procedural. When needing to convey proper gravias, Horatio will remove his sunglasses. But after a particularly clever line, Horatio the Sunglasses of Justice that every guilty pleasure CSI: Miami fan loves come sliding back on. Delicious.   CSI: Miami is based on Gameloft's Special Crime Unit: Blood on Campus game, a forensics procedural that was essentially an episode of CSI without the actual CSI license. Special Crime Unit was a fun, effective game -- but by finally marrying its smart gameplay with the CSI license Gameloft so obviously wanted, the game feels absolutely complete. There is positively no reason any fan of CSI: Miami will not enjoy this mobile game.   The player essentially sees Miami through the eyes of David Caruso's Horatio. A young woman's body has washed up on the beach. Though she was hot, her lungs are full of water indicating that she drowned. From this springboard, almost the entire team dedicates the next few hours (game time) to solving this mystery by using every trick in the CSI book, such as running prints, performing autopsies, and searching scenes for any missed evidence. After assembling a case, the team must ferret out the criminal from a list of possible suspects.   CSI Miami offers three difficulty levels for dedicated fans. The easiest setting offers constant hints and removes the risk of making bad plays, but lowers the score for working the case properly. The hardest setting gives no guidance, but ups the points for hitting all of Horatio's marks. I'm not necessarily sold on how many times a fan will replay the game, but including these options is certainly a welcome addition.   Gameloft apparently enjoyed full cooperation from CBS and the producers of the show. Actor likenesses are used, the dialogue is pitch perfect, and the case is something akin to what you'd actually find on the show -- save for some of the melodrama that frames each season.  CSI: Miami is an excellent game for fans of the hit show, thanks to Gameloft's deft ability to combine solid game mechanics with the essentials that make so many people tune into the show each week. The dialogue is perfect and the case is compelling. There is no reason why CBS shouldn't have Gameloft assemble another of these games for the original CSI franchise. And there is no reason why Gameloft shouldn't juice this successful framework with several more cases and challenge Phoenix Wright on the Nintendo DS.", "date": "Oct 1, 2007"}
