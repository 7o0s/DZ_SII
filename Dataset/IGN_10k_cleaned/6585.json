The saucy dishing of the four leading ladies (who didn't always act like ladies) was often a favorite component of the show, as I can attest. On more than one occasion, I heard cackling coming from the living room after a particularly spiky comment from Samantha, played by Kim Cattrall. Some of the snarkiness was indeed lost on me, but maybe that's because when I talk about a Dorito, I'm referring to a snack. (A snack that comes in a bag that you buy at the grocery store, pervert.)   Naturally, HBO wants to capitalize on the unending popularity of the girls, but I'm not exactly sure that this Psychic Cocktail is the way to go. For one thing, the connection to the show is tenuous. Instead of being privy to the lunch table musings of the four women, you're treated to a branded Magic 8-Ball experience. You simply ask yourself a question -- perhaps regarding your potential beau? -- or choose from some pre-determined questions. Either way, after a second or two, the psychic cocktail pours out some pretty generic advice. ~Are diamonds a girl's best friend?~ That's not a question -- that's an answer. Whether or not you think that indicates a positive response likely says more about your disposition than anything this bartender can serve up.   I can certainly appreciate the desire to make a branded experience -- it's easy money. But I honestly don't think this helps the brand in any way, and may make more than a few mobile subscribers hesitant to buy another mobile product from HBO again.  Like the characters on the show, Psychic Cocktail goes down easy but comes up empty. I know it's all supposed to be in good fun, but I gotta feel a lot more zsa-zsa-zsu about a mobile game before I recommend that somebody spends their money on it.", "date": "Jan 31, 2006"}
