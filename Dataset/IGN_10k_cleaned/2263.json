It turned out that controllers were a complete waste of money in that game because there was hardly any skill or coordination required. But the concept of a high speed arcade hockey game still held a ton of promise because of the nature of the sport itself and the technological improvements new consoles could offer. NHL Hitz 2002 is that high speed arcade hockey game that we've been wanting for the last five years and launching it with the Xbox will undo the damage Gretzky did on the Nintendo 64.  Hitz plays a great game of arcade hockey and offers more features that you would expect from such a presumably shallow title.  Like NBA Jam/Showtime and NFL Blitz before it, the wide open game play means you can get into the game in the blink of an eye, but most of Hitz' longevity will have to come from the multiplayer component.   The Features   30 NHL teams and real NHL players 7 Mini-Games 14 fantasy teams and fantasy arenas 15 fantasy heads  53 heritage jerseys and teams  Fully polygonal crowd Customizable teams and players  Tons of Midway's ever popular codes including Big Head and Always On Fire.   Gameplay It's funny how people want to play 3-on-3 over-the-top hockey with real NHL players, because those are some pro athletes known for their skill and power, not their ability to catch on fire. But getting hot and catching on fire is what Hitz and every other Midway sports game is about. Having a player or your entire team burning with additional speed, skills and aggressiveness is what takes the sport of hockey over the top in Hitz because speed literally becomes everything.  To hockey purists this maybe a slap in the face of Lord Stanley, but in terms of pure videogame fun, I have to admit that Hitz is damn entertaining. I love the fact that you have the sport stripped down to the basics of checking and scoring. Every other part of the game is secondary including the rules. No offsides, icing or line changes to get in the way of the action. Get in a fight and whoop some puny forward's ass? Good for you and keep on playing because there is no penalty box! Like they did with football and basketball before, Midway has brought us a sports game that only features the stuff about the sport that we care about. I've always known that team sports with continuous action like hockey and soccer would make great adrenaline games but to finally see it as a reality is a good feeling.  With basic gameplay established, developer Black Box added season, franchise and customizing modes to allow gamers to become attached to Hitz over time. You can play as the New Jersey Devils, but don't expect to duplicate their suffocating defense in this game because you've only got three guys and somebody has to do the scoring. The franchise mode is especially satisfying since you can take your own crappy team of losers and build them up into contenders by earning attribute points. As you're earning points to build your team you're also earning  points to buy stuff in the Hockey Shop. Vintage jerseys like Pittsburgh's old skating penguin sweater or Ottawa's original 1920's striped job are the coolest prizes to be found in the shop. But the fantasy teams, arenas and heads you can buy are cool too. The best part is that you're buying the unlockable items you want rather than the computer giving them to you in a specific order as you progress through the game.   The worst part about the franchise mode is there is no stat tracking to speak of. Hockey isn't the most statistically intensive sport, so why not keep track of goals, assists, saves and maybe fights won?  The violence in Hitz is much more satisfying than what we've seen in NFL Blitz. First, there are few things sweeter than checking some bloke into the polygonal crowd through a pane of shatter-proof glass. Second, you actually need to have some skill when a fight breaks out because losing means your guy is out for the rest of the game. Thank goodness the NHL has gotten over its fear of fighting in its licensed videogames.   The control scheme is very intuitive and similar to what we've seen in other hockey games. The best additions are the turbo function on the analog trigger, a dedicated spin move and deke button and post goal cheering and booing buttons. In a game like this, you certainly don't want cumbersome controls to get in the way and thankfully they don't.  Graphics The player models in Hitz are very stylized but also very well done. They animate beautifully, so with the exception of a few unavoidable clipping problems, you can always see exactly what a player is doing. A devastating check looks the part as your guy will wind up and follow through with his forearm or shoulder.  And unlike the PS2 version, the Xbox Hitz 2002 stays at 60 frames per second.  But it's the stuff around the players that will catch your eye first. The reflections off the ice look better than what you see watching National Hockey Night on TV. They're just crisp and clear enough so that you know they're there but the images aren't overdone so as to take away from the player models themselves or the real time shadows that are also being cast onto the ice. Even when you try to look for any slowdown in either the reflections, shadows or player models themselves (check some of Project Gotham Racing's car reflections to see what we mean), there is none. You really shouldn't be watching the reflections and shadows while playing but if you do, you'll be very impressed.  The most impressive lighting effects are when a player or two or even three catch on fire. The entire arena darkens a little so you can better appreciate the glowing orange or blue (team) fire around the player models. When they go into the corners of the rink the sideboards light up from the energy. The puck itself actually gives off a glow and lights everything when it's on fire from a ~hot spot shot~ or a fiery player. You really haven't seen anything like this yet.  The crowd is made up of polygonal little people sitting, clapping, cheering and just having a rollicking good time. Granted, I've seen more people packed into a high school gym, but the couple hundred hockey fans at every Hitz game are very well done. In fact they're in integral part of the game. There are four yahoos in the back row of every arena holding up cards with orange boxes, letters, symbols and directional arrows every time there's a break in the action and the camera is close enough to the sideboards to catch them. Those placards are the ever popular Midway codes that tell you how to unlock stuff like the ever popular Big Head Mode. You'll have to be quick to notice the symbols and sequence and they don't tell you what the codes unlock but this is a great way to deliver some semi-important information. This is the Xbox folks, and it's time for polygonal crowds that actually do stuff in sports games.   Sound Tim Kitzrow. That's the name of the guy who does all of the hollering and quipping throughout Midway sports games. You can impress your friends with that bit of trivia and you'll impress all of IGN if you can admit to actually digging this guy's shtick. Actually, he's not that bad in Hitz, so I won't be so tough on him. I just won't tell you abut his pop culture references like ~Hit me baby, one more time!~ that he'll make after big checks. There are a ton of nicknames in Hitz that Kitzrow will use when you assign them to your created players, so that's a big positive. But with the exponential leap EA Sports made in their NHL 2002 commentary, Midway's tried and true formula is starting to weaken.  The best sound feature in Hitz is that you can use your own created soundtrack in the game which makes it the first sports title to do so, I'm pretty sure. Your tunes won't play during actual hockey games, but they'll kick in on the menus and pause screen. Basically, whenever the announcer doesn't need to be heard, you'll hear your music. Very cool, indeed. But if you would prefer Hitz' Xbox specific jukebox, you can listen to tunes from Limp Bizkit, Korn and Staind already built into the game. Fred Durst growling ~Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin~ works in wrestling and even stock car racing but not so much in hockey.  The checks, skating and arena sounds are all well done. Nothing spectacular but they're definitely as good as they should be.  It shouldn't be such a guilty pleasure to enjoy Hitz but it is and I'm comfortable with my guilt. It's great mindless videogaming fun which is what all of this used to be about no so long ago. Midway has the formula down and it's just a matter of adopting new technology to their needs. They've done that with Xbox. The fluidity of the game is what allowed Black Box to capture the essence of hockey. Everything is flowing continuously up and down the ice but with believable physics and animation. There's not much more in the way of realism you could ask of an arcade hockey game.But Hitz is indeed an arcade game at heart and so the depth that would add value to this purchase isn't there. Even with all of the additional modes like the mini games and customization options, you'll quickly realize they all lead back to the same basic  play mechanic. As far as the single player mode goes, it's not too difficult to run through a season in one evening maybe two. You'd better have a nice supply of buddies to play  against if you want to get your money's worth out of Hitz 2002. It's instant gratification that's not so good for you in the long run like tequila, an econo-box of Twinkies or the Spice Channel.", "date": "Nov 15, 2001"}
