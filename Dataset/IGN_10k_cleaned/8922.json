Like Diner Dash and Cake Mania before it, I-play's ER Rush is a constant balancing act, testing you cool until the whole game comes crashing down on top of you. The difference between ER Rush and those previous two popular titles, though, is the stakes. You're not blowing a cake order in this one -- getting behind the curve results in nothing short of a patient's death.   If you've played Diner Dash, the formula should be familiar to you, but here's the general rub for ER Rush: You must maintain an escalating series of busy emergency rooms by diagnosing and treating patients. You must check in at bedsides to keep patients happy, order proper tests to come up with the right diagnosis, and dispense medications to keep them alive. Each patient has a heart gauge that monitors vitality. If that heart goes black, you have seconds to get to that bed and fix the situation.   Beds are assigned numbers, so you use the number pad to place and move amongst the patients, as well as fetch prescriptions. You use the directional pad to pull patients from the waiting room and pick up goodies, such as flowers and other stress-reducers. One of ER Rush's smartest features is the ability to input a series of number presses so your doctor performs a string of activities, keeping you hopefully just a few steps ahead of the titular rush.   Keeping your patients stress-free through presents or just standing at their bedside during a moment of ~down time~ is an excellent to maintain spirits and keep them alive. (ER Rush seems to be a bit of pointed commentary -- just personal attention from the otherwise faceless medical industry helps almost as much as a pill.) To keep things from becoming too heavy, your patients sometimes come into the ER with goofy maladies like frozen heads or vampirism. This is an important addition that counteracts the stakes and keeps ER Rush from becoming borderline maudlin.   As you and your patients survive your days in the ER, you earn points eventually result in promotions. You graduate to new hospitals that bring new diseases (some are communicable, so you must consider bed placement, too) and faster pacing. The worse the diseases and ailments, the harder it is to get people in and out of the ER. If you don't find the right rhythm, you end up with a full waiting room and patients dangerously close to coding. But that's just part of the ~spinning plate~ formula -- either you like to see how long you can keep everything up in the air, or you'd rather play Bejeweled.  ER Rush follows right in the footsteps of Diner Dash and Cake Mania, but the hospital spin keeps it from being feeling like a total ~me too~ production. The visuals are bright and light so things never become too heavy-handed. The controls are completely manageable (although, I cannot imagine playing this with the flat keypad of the RAZR -- I test on a Sony Ericsson w810i). If you like the ~spinning plate~ style of puzzle game like I do, ER Rush is an excellent download. It offers hours of engaging entertainment, challenging you to just try ~one more level.~ And when a game has me putting off writing a review just to play that ~one more level,~ I know it's a winner.", "date": "Aug 17, 2007"}
