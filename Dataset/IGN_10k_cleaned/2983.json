Back in the day, the mixed lot of 8-bit and 16-bit 2D games either hit or missed the mark hard, while the interim of 32-bit games nearly ruined superhero games altogether. Neversoft's Spider-Man, which first appeared on PlayStation, marked the first real 32-bit superhero game worth its weight in bits and bytes. It showed other game makers what could be done using the excellent Tony Hawk engine, blending classic standard gameplay techniques with new interesting new ones. Neversoft demonstrated immense respect toward its comic book hero, and in turn showed great respect toward comic book fans.   So, here we are in the ~next-generation~ age. Starting up in 2001, the first Batman game, Batman Vengeance, was pretty good. Treyarch's Spider-Man hit on all cylinders, adding new wrinkles to the game and the genre. Now everyody wants a piece of the comic book action. Add The Hulk, Fantastic Four, Iron Man, Justice League, Daredevil, Aquaman, Superman, and well, you can see where things are going.   Having absolutely nothing to do with the Titus-made Nintendo 64 Superman title, the Sheffield House-developed Superman: Shadow of Apokalips is a sigh of relief. Based on the animated TV series of the same name, Superman: Shadow of Apokalips offers all of the Man of Steel's powers, likeable control, and all of the supporting characters, from Jimmy Olson, Lois Lane, Perry White, and old time favorite enemies Lex Luthor and Darkseid, plus a never-ending supply of robots. It's a decent superhero game that any DC might like and it's a slightly better than average videogame, but sadly, it's nothing terribly special.  Gameplay What has every Superman fan always wanted to do? To fly, fight, and feel like the last son of Krypton. And what a superhero games needs to do more than anything else is to re-create those abilities on a system, and to replicate them in that character's universe without giving up any of his or personality, charm or unique characteristics. Shadow of Apokalips does a good job at handling the controls, and it delivers a very respectable performance in making sure all of the best Superman powers are within the grasp of your hands. It even mixes in a little stealth and arcade-style button mashing for good measure. What Shadow of Apokalips doesn't do so well is to tell a good story or to deliver a high-level production game. But we'll get there later.   Players take on the role of Daily Planet Reporter Clark Kent, A.K.A. Superman. Scientists have been stolen across the city, and Superman has confronted a swarm of mysterious high-powered Inter-Bot robots, who have indicated to him that the city may be headed toward serious trouble. In the beginning, the Inter-Bots even have some heavy fusion-style guns that knock him unconscious for a spell. What's happening behind the scenes is that Darkseid, though his assassin Kanto, has gifted LexCorp R&D with powerful Apokoliptian technology, and as the Inter-Bots cause havoc and scour the city for scientists to fulfill their great quest, you must return order to the city and stop the madness, as it were. You'll meet up with a massive Inter-Bot army and Metallo during the course of action.  Shadow of Apokalips is a straight-up action game, based around Superman's powers. Sheffield's grasp of Superman's controls is nearly 99% on target. Players need a little bit of time to get it all under control, but within about 15 minutes or so, employing Superman's many powers becomes second nature. Players can walk, run, fly, punch, throw, pull pipes off walls to attack enemies, pick up huge objects, such as busses or tanks and throw them and more.  He can use two kinds of heat blasts -- a thin single laser shot that slowly lights enemies on fire, or the more energy-sapping blasts that usually take the enemy out with two shots. Superman can use his super breath to cool overheated containers or fires, or he can use it to blow enemies off their feet. He can see through walls using his X-ray vision, though unfortunately he can't see through Lois' skirt. (Ah well, maybe next time...) He can hover, fly slow, fly super fast, and perform air attacks  -- by landing with a clear-out stomp or by using a speeding-bullet punch. He can even perform a spin attack for clearing out purposes, too.  All of Superman's controls are well handled. In fact, they're deceivingly simple to handle. Press triangle to use eyes beams; circle to use super breath. Press R2 to engage in soaring fly; or the right analog stick to ascend or descend. X is attack; press it a few times repeatedly and Superman unwinds a series of pre-animated jabs, uppercuts and hooks. He can even knock an enemy into a daze and then perform a super punch, sending the enemy soaring across the room.   While it takes about 10-15 minutes to get used to the controls, Shadow of Apokalips controls with a near simplistic genius. Sheffield House has animated Superman well too, supporting the feel and better yet the look of the Man of Steel. When he soars quickly through the air, one hand stretches outward while the other is tucked neatly at his side. Transitioning from the ground to air is seamless. Using L1, players can target enemies or objects, an even strafe in mid-air around them, an excellent notion. Combing all of Superman's powers throughout the game is a real kick. Finally, we get to play as Superman right. Thank you Sheffield House.  Shown from the third-person perspective, Superman's movement captured with respectable camera work. The camera rarely transitions into odd positions, and when in a smaller room, it automatically lowers. Occasionally it does stick on objects and every so often you can see mistakenly through the wall to another room. In some cases Superman turns invisible to continue seeing the action while he fights.   While the controls are right on the money, the gameplay itself wears a bit thin, and that's where Superman comes down to earth. Players never stop fighting the constant hordes of Inter-bots, which serve to thwart you through 90% of the game, growing in numbers and simply becoming tedious, rather than growing more fun. Yes, the thrill of fighting more Inter-bots requires more skill, and you'll need it too, but seeing as how there are 900 million other cool Superman enemies I'd rather be fighting, these generic toolboxes aren't quite what I had in mind.   I did have fun in some levels, specifically the dam section where I had to free victims, plug generator cells into the dam and then, just like a very old-school coin-op game (or any Olympics game), repeatedly punch X to plug the pins back into the dam to prevent it from bursting. There are timed missions, straight-up attack-the-hordes missions, and all are bookended with cutscenes, so that you know what the objectives are. And if you mistakenly die, the game smartly restarts you after the last cutscene, rather than at the level's very beginning. The Clark Kent stealth missions are priceless, too. If you continue to try and fly or do things Kent wouldn't do in his reporter outfit, you'll hear him say things like, ~I can't do that!~ or ~I can't fly when I'm not in costume.~ Very smart, very funny.   Superman isn't a very long game either, coming in at about 7-10 hours, depending on your ability. This game could easily have used more bosses, more classic DC enemies -- and other DC comic book heroes, the way that Activision incorporated so many with Spider-man -- and a little grit and danger. While the animated series is neat and all, it represents the cleanest, most staid version of Superman ever. He's got no personality, very little humor, and with almost no story at all, there isnt much thinking going on. It's just level after level of blasting Inter-Bots. Sheesh. Heck, even Superman, in his various forms, has personality (though he is the driest of the bunch), and a story-driven-plot would have added a lot of spice to these empty levels.   My only other gripe is that using Superman's X-ray vision was awkwardly handled and underused. Why can't he see through more walls? Perhaps another stealth level using these abilities would have answered these questions best. Graphics Re-created almost precisely from the stylings of the animated TV series, Shadow of Apokalips looks, well, like the show. The cel-shading is the graphic main feature, and everything about the game's visual design is influenced by art deco design (simple, modern, curvilinear), from the building design to the sanserif typeface. It's a highly stylized look that very much resembles the look created in last year's Batman: Vengeance. So, as far as it goes, it's at least an accurate re-creation.   Perhaps what's best about the game is Superman's animation. He moves incredibly well, from his flight mechanic to the most simply animations, such as pulling pipes off walls, turning in flight or even taking a missile in the head, after which he is propelled backward, and his limp lifeless body reacts in kind. His cape looks good too: Trailing in the breeze, never getting in the way, and fluidly moving all the time.   But I have a bone to pick with this particular use of cel-shading. I realize the game is supposed to look like the TV show, but both the show and this game are horrifically dull to view. The game not only looks plain, it's flat out boring to look at; it's as if all of the power of the PS2 (heh, haven't used that phrase in a while) is for naught. Even cel-shading can look good, and here it just essentially covers things with the most basic and unimaginative of looks possible. The lack of detail is what best describes this game's visuals, and unlike the brilliantly cel-shaded Sly Cooper and the Theivious Racoonus, for instance, this looks of this game show little imagination or attention to detail.  Sound The TV voice actors who perform the TV voices are used for the game. The roster includes Tim Daly (Superman), Clancy Brown (Luthor), Lori Petty (the villain Livewire), Michael York (Kanto), Malcolm Mcdowell (through a heavy filter, playing Metallo), and several other actors. The soundtrack is original, including about 40 minutes of excellent orchestral compositions. The soundtrack is perfect to listen to.  While the voice acting of the TV actors is indeed used in Shadow of Apokalips, it all comes off with the most lifeless of deliveries. The editing or production of the game is sincerely off putting. The conversation are absolutely flat, with long pauses in between sentences, characters wobbling about standing there with no expression, ready to speak, but not speaking, and the writing is just as dull as old gum. ~Superman, thank you!~ ~You saved my life!~ How can I ever thank you enough!~... these are the kinds of dull-witted things we hear throughout the game. Sure, that's classic Superman dialog (from the 1950s), but you play through the whole game and listen to this dialog and tell me I doesn't sound as if a porn script writer snuck in there and changed things around. ~Oh, Superman, how can I ever repay you...~ one female civilian says... Hm... Maybe, that's a little unfair, but given the possibilities, these characters say some of the most boring, dull and unimaginative things possible.  One more thing: various voices sound much higher and much clearer than other voices in this game, indicating to me there are problems in the final production cut. It's not a big deal, but the final game doesn't feel -- or sound -- like a very final version.I have pretty much said it all here. This is a slightly better-than-decent action game, featuring excellent control and animations, and some notable production problems in sound and graphics (lots of texture seams to be exact). It's a thrill to finally play a Superman game that's handled with this much care and keen observation, with regard to control and special abilities. You're going to love blasting enemies from the sky with Superman's laser eyes, blowing them off their feet with his breath and employing the score of other excellent Superman abilities. If you liked the Ubi Soft version of Batman: Vengeance, then you will very much like Superman: Shadow of Apokalips. Superman, however, controls very well and it feels very good, for having so many little technical problems throughout the rest of the game. I'm quite sure Superman fans finally have the game of their dreams on their hands. Still, it's short, and some of the mission objectives are a little unclear. And there isn't that much in the way of super villains (OK, pretty much none) or other DC characters, which is a big disappointment, and of course, the story is vapid, empty poo. But I guess I can't complain too much, we are talking about a videogame based on a comic. Then again...", "date": "Sep 26, 2002"}
