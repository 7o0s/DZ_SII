But now that Biomotor Unitron has reared its portable head, things have changed, and for the better. An immensely popular category of video games, RPGs appear time and time again on peoples' wish lists, and it's only natural that a Japanese developer, in this case Yumekobo, cranks one out for valuable customers. And now that Biomotor Unitron decided to poke its head out, our adventuring needs should be completely saturated for at least a little while. Features:  4 main dungeons with random floor designs Hundreds of combinations Link cable support  Three save slots For NeoGeo Pocket Color     A bit confusing since it swings in a different direction when compared to most every other RPG in existence, Biomotor Unitron shows its true colors early on.  In a very untypical manner, you won't have to worry about seeking out other cities or reading through a long, detailed plot.  Instead, you'll spend most of your time earning money in the randomly-created dungeons, which can be spent to either upgrade your UNITRON in a variety of ways.  With the ability to buy more powerful arms, legs, cores, and packs, along with multiple selections for each category, there won't be any trouble deciding what to blow your cash on.  Once your UNITRON is as ultimate as you want it to be, you can either roam the dungeons in hopes of making it to the bottom, or participate in the infamous tournament with the intentions of gaining the ~Master of Masters~ title!  In one of the four different dungeons, not including the hidden ruin, you'll get to go toe to toe in battles, and search for valuable treasures scattered all over.  Each floor, decided randomly by the game itself, is different with each entry, and adds a bit more spice to gameplay since you'll probably be entering each one on several occasions.  In addition to several dark dungeons which are available for deep exploration, the tournament just seems to beckon you forth.  After paying an entry fee each time you wish to enter, you get to duke it out with other UNITRONs.  If you win every single battle, you earn yourself a higher title and a cash prize, both of which come in handy in their own ways.  The higher your rank, for example, the more characters there are in town, and the larger the amount of what people say.  One of the more innovative inclusions in Biomotor Unitron is that you can develop your UNITRON in  numerous ways.  For one, you can head over to the shop and purchase body parts straight up, ranging from arms, which are used as weapons, to legs, which supply a large amount of hit points and defensive power, and beyond.  Aside from this, you can develop old pieces of equipment with the right kinds of metal and tools, turning what was once useless junk into something that could aid you along well in your journey to become the Master of Masters.   Based heavily without a strong supporting story, Biomotor Unitron relies more on RPG gameplay than anything else to keep its players addicted.  Your main cause for developing such a powerful mechanism is so that you can prove just what kind of a warrior you are to the entire world.  Your faithful companion, male or female depending on the starting character you choose, is at your side and ready to help you at every opportunity.  Although not a participant in battle, he or she will wait for you at Rhafiace City and perform all the necessary actions to upgrade your machine.  But before you can do anything to your UNITRON, you have to have the cash  to pay for whatever you want.  And getting that can be done best through  battling different enemies with the normal turn-based system. Just like most  every other RPG, Biomotor Unitron's fights rely on selecting one of  several choices per attack, which vary from using your current weapon or  item to recharging your EP, points that are spent each time you use your  ARMS, or fleeing.  As simple as they can possibly be, the duels aren't  difficult to figure out, and leave you without any confusion.  The nice-looking graphics are down to the basics when in a dungeon, but look best while you're exploring the sections of the city.  With colorful designs and large, detailed characters, the different areas located within Rhafiace City boast a bit more than the other sections of the game, and won't make you want to keel over.  The music, similarly nice, fits the mood well for whichever location you may be exploring, and doesn't become repetitive  in any way whatsoever.  Pleasing to both eye and ear, the graphics and audio work well throughout the entire adventure. If you're a Neo Geo Pocket enthusiast looking for a fun time with a RPG, and you don't mind a game that lacks a thick plot, Biomotor Unitron should float your boat.  Although it's nothing that borders perfection today by most gamers' standards, it has a fair share to be enjoyed.  And since portable gaming is meant to be for those of us on the go, it really is just more practical that way.  Even if a game's story isn't crucial to your purchasing, though, Yumekobo could have included more areas to keep gamers coming back time and time again. With only 5 dungeons, including the hidden ruin, and one small town, the amount of things to see and do aren't exactly elevated to unimaginable proportions. In addition to this, some of the text could have been translated a bit better; attacks introduced like ~Rod's Wizard!!~ or ~Stump's Tackle!!~ really don't come off sounding well. Monotonous gameplay and other problems aside, Biomotor Unitron proves to be a fun game regardless of anything else. And since it's the only RPG currently available for NGPC, it's got some things leaning in its favor.", "date": "Sep 18, 1999"}
