Respect Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/10/scarface-money-power-respect-review", "text": "Here's a brief precaution for those who may not know. Scarface on PSP is a different game than it is on the PS2. Aside from the Scarface license, the two games share nothing in common. Where the PS2 version follows the Grand Theft Auto series, in that you explore and exploit an open world, Scarface on PSP sets definitive boundaries. It's not an action game at all, but a turn-based strategy game where your goal is to conquer enemy turf and ultimately rule Miami.  One has to wonder why developers took this route, seeing as how the first Grand Theft Auto game on PSP sold so well. Time constraints come to mind, and so does wanting to make the game fun in short bursts, but who really knows. What really matters is how it plays. And while Scarface: Money. Respect. Power definitely has its high points, it doesn't offer the kind of excitement that its console sibling does. Developers included all the pieces; it's not a bad strategy game, but it lacks that special something. Even when at the top of your game as a Miami kingpin, the game never gives you a sense of what it promises: money, power and respect.    Before jumping into all of that, it serves to backup and tackle a few basics. The game splits into two main modes: single-player and multiplayer. The single-player mode then splits again, this time into Movie Scenarios and Cartel Challenge. Most players will probably start with the former, if only because it happens to sit first on the list when you jump into single-player. Here, things start with clips from the Scarface film. They help set the tone and goal of each individual scenario, whether the goal is to amass wealth, take over rivals or build a certain amount of structures, such as cocaine labs. You get a certain amount of cash to start, usually 500k, and then set off to complete your primary (and if you're good) secondary goals, such as killing lots of enemy henchmen.  As stated earlier, Scarface on PSP is a turned-based strategy title. You play by round with each round consisting of three phases. The first is the Buy phase, where you hire thugs and by structures such as cocaine labs and drug warehouses. You can also hire pushers - the lowlifes who actually sell the drugs on the streets after you make them. This phase is definitely the most important, as it dictates how well you perform in later phases. As such, you will spend plenty of time studying which territories carry which benefit and build/hire accordingly. It's not all that complicated, though, so those looking for serious depth when it comes to management may find it a little dull.   It all boils down to maximizing assets by hiring new pushers and building drug laboratories. If you have enough people cranking out coke and enough people selling it on the streets, then you earn enough money at the end of each round to hire even more pushers and so on. After taking care of these requisite steps of the Buy phase, then you can buy Power Moves. You can buy them in the areas of Law, Drugs and Combat. And here's where the game gets interesting. If you have a wide variety of these Power Moves, which can do everything from effect the pricing of drugs to grant your henchmen health and weapons bonuses, the city of Miami is as good as yours. And they're not too pricey, either. You earn upwards of 1 million dollars per round early in the game, and Power Moves range from 20k - 300k. Considering how crazily they swing the odds in your favor, they seem pretty damn cheap.     Of course, rival cartels can use these power moves as well, so it never hurts to go all out and buy as many as you can before entering the Dealing Phase. Here, you actually sell the drugs you manufacture. The only thing you need are pushers and product, both of which you get from the previous phase. Depending on the amount of labs and pushers you acquired, you will move all or only some of your ~stuff.~ If you failed to hire enough pushers, your leftover product will end up in storehouses, assuming you purchased some in the Buy Phase.      The act of selling drugs is not as thrilling as it could have been, considering how important an element it is to the Scarface license. Sure, it's a strategy game and by definition supposed to be hands-off to a degree, but developers could have spiced it up a little bit.  As it stands, all you do is cycle through available turfs to see where a particular drug sells best and then hit the sell button. It's all over in a second or two. Nothing ever compromises a sale. You have to deal with random drug busts from cops, which affect all cartels equally, but it has nothing to do with actually moving your drugs. The quality of the pushers you hire never comes into play, either. They all seem to work effectively - like drug-dealing robots who never complain, burn out or fail.    The final step in every round is the Combat Phase. Here's where you choose to defend your turf or invade the turf of a neighboring cartel. You can see how many thugs each cartel has on a particular turf, so you can actually plan ahead by hiring more muscle than the competition. You can also spend more on Power Moves if you don't have enough to actually hire armed henchmen, which usually go for more than 200k a piece. Once you enter combat, whether defending or attacking, the camera zooms in from the over-the-city view to the actual street where you can see each side firing at each other. Just like everything else in the game, combat goes by in turns. You can decide to attack, defend or use Power Moves. It's a pretty simple and straightforward affair.   The only twists that arise during combat are related to the Power Moves. For instance, say one side has nine men while the there only has five. The side with the disadvantage can use one of the moves, called appropriately ~Say hello to my little friend!~ and wipe out three guys in one fell swoop, greatly evening the odds. In addition, you can use other moves to give your men grenade launchers or to hire snipers to take out several baddies in one turn. You also have the option to set car bombs, killing a rival cartel's reinforcements and disabling their ability to call any more. In the end, combat plays out decently, but just like the drug dealing phase, it's not all that exciting for being such a huge part of the game. It works fine and there's a little depth to it, but serious strategy fans will crave a little more.    And that's how the game goes. You buy stuff and hire people, sell drugs and then fight rival cartels for turf. You work each phase to varying degrees, depending on the goal or scenario, but that's as deep as things get in Scarface. Multiplayer takes some of the scenarios in Cartel Challenge and lets you compete against friends. It's actually pretty fun and does add a bit of extra enjoyment to the game, but it would have been nice to see something wholly unique in multiplayer.  Scarface on PSP lacks the excitement of its console sibling. It has plenty of scenarios from the movie, as well as some of its own, but the strategy never gets deep enough to make up for the lack of real action. Having said that, it delivers on its promise of letting one strategically conquer 1980s Miami. In the end, players will score decent playtime knee-deep in corruption and coke, but the experience has few thrills and surprises. It might please certain fans of the movie, but it simply doesnt do much to keep the adrenaline pumping for very long.", "date": "Oct 10, 2006"}
