Granted, Crime Life isn't the same kind of game as 187, which was a driving combat game. It's more akin to Beat Down in that you'll spend most of your time roaming around city streets and engaging in random fights with rival gangs, innocent pedestrians, and pesky police officers. You'll get missions, get money, take over new territory, and command gang members. Unfortunately, the fighting system is so boring you'll likely never bother to progress very far.   You play as Tre, a citizen of the impoverished Hood district in Grand Central City. As a Hood resident, you're dream is to become a member of the Outlawz, the local gang. In order to get accepted by the gang boss, Big Dog, you'll have to run a few missions that involve killing some people, and you'll soon find yourself a bona fide Outlaw with a few gang members that follow you around. The game's story isn't all that spectacular. It's got a few betrayals here and there, but it's not going to hook you in any way.   After the 5000th time, this gets repetitive. The game world is divided into several sections all connected though a subway system. Though the course of your missions you'll visit plenty of decaying ghettos like Gangland, which is controlled by rival gang the Headhunterz. You'll also be smashing the faces of KYC members, another rival gang, around the Chinatown area, as well as the Pogue Mahoneys, the most badass Irishmen you'll ever meet and who all happen to have the exact same character models. You'll also be given the luxury of visiting the posh district of Blingsley Hills. Yes, it's actually called Blingsley. That may be all the evidence you need to make up your mind whether to buy this game or not.   So what's there to do in the world of Crime Life: Gang Wars? Well, you can't steal cars, you can't drive cars, you can't build stats, you can't customize your move sets, and you've got an extremely limited freedom when deciding which missions to complete. What you can do is fight, and you'll be doing this a lot. Missions in Crime Life fall into three general categories: kill, steal, and, well actually there are only two categories. As you kill you'll accomplish different objectives, such as taking over new territories and convincing people to do things, like killing some pimps so they hand over their hookers.   That sure is a lot of enemies...that look identical. The extreme emphasis on killing isn't the problem. I mean, video games were pretty much created so people could kill stuff without moral consequences and jail time, but the fighting system here just isn't engaging enough to build a game around. You'll be able to perform weak and strong punches and combine them into simple combos. Unfortunately, these attacks to practically no damage, so you'll have to rely on your special attacks to take down many of your foes. Special attacks require adrenaline, which you build up by punching your opponents. If your opponent gets down to zero health, you'll be able to bust out a killing move which, as might be expected, kills them.     Crime Life's combat issues are mostly due to the fact that your fighting strategy never changes. It's basically combo, block, wait for opponent to attack as you circle around, then bust out another attack. Repeat until you can finish them. If you manage to land 40 hits in a row without being hit yourself, you'll be able to get extra speed and damage, but this doesn't change your fighting strategy. Also detrimental is the lack of a precise targeting system and the fact that many of your teammates get in the way. These are mostly problems when there are large scale gang fights with like 20 guys or so. People will constantly move in front of you, impeding your progress toward your intended target. You'll also find that switching targets is extremely difficult, so if you've got someone slamming your back with a bat, you'd better kill the guy you're fighting fast since it's easier than trying to switch your focus to the larger threat.   There are weapons in Crime Life, and they're definitely worth picking up for their extra damage, especially the swords. Each weapon prompts a unique finishing move animation, so it's interesting to see them all, though far from compelling. Melee weapons will eventually break, and guns will run out of ammo, so you'll never be hanging on to any weapon for an extended period of time.   Skipping across the friendly neighborhood. You'll be running from mission to mission flanked by varying numbers of gang members with names like Koruptt and Darryl. You'll also have the pleasure of meeting plenty of other violent characters named with an unnecessary abundance of consonants. Your teammates are actually pretty helpful since they're able to divert an enemy's attention, though it's still much more effective to kill people yourself. You're able to monitor your squad's health through the main menu and replenish it at fast food joints, much like your own. If a squad member's health happens to fall to zero, they don't die for some reason. Instead, they just stop attacking the enemy and double over like they're out of breath.   As you parade around Grand Central City's streets, you'll probably get confused as to what you're supposed to be doing. There's no real list of objectives in Crime Life, just an electronic inbox. Each inbox message gives you a task, but it's easy to miss something since many of the messages contain multiple objectives. For instance, you might find yourself wandering aimlessly about town during one mission when it seems as though everything's been completed. It's probably because you forgot to read the end of one particular paragraph on one of the messages that told you to spray paint your tag on a specific wall. This lack of clarity as to what you're supposed to be doing is compounded by the fact that sometimes the game shows you exactly where you're supposed to go on your map, whereas at other times it tells you nothing. Why the lack of consistency?   Commanding your squad doesn't matter since they're seemingly invincible. You'll be getting into plenty of fights between and during missions, often with wandering cops or gangsters. Aside from the fighting being generally boring, you get no rewards for taking out huge groups of foes. You'll get no stat boosts, no extra moves, and no special items, just dead foes. You only get extra moves by beating levels. You will regain slight amounts of power and charge your adrenaline and rage gauges from fighting, but this is nothing permanent. Some missions tell you to get more respect before you try to do them, but there's no respect gauge. If you get a mission to get more respect, you'll almost always get a message from someone else with another task. If you complete that one, then you'll magically have more respect, though there's no indication of such. It would have been better to see a respect system put into place where killing enemies would net you small increases, but alas, that is not the case.     In terms of graphics, this game pretty much stinks. Environments are painfully plain and the textures boast a level of detail that rivals some of the worst titles released around the Xbox's launch. Character models look awkward and the facial animation is laughable. During some of the larger fights, you'll also experience some slowdown. Character and vehicle models are reused to a ridiculous degree. Almost every enemy you fight looks exactly the same and there are about ten vehicle models in the entire game. Speaking of vehicle models, your character apparently has some sort of hidden strength. It may take him 200 punches to down a tough opponent in a one on one battle, but with one or two he can total a car. The environments are destructible to some extent. Windows can be broken, phones and parking meters can be smashed for cash, and your character even has the uncanny ability to slice apart fire hydrants with a flick of his wrist.   Though the game's visuals are generally terrible, the finishing moves are kind of cool. They're presented as a slow motion cut scene that highlights your character stepping on enemy necks or snapping their backs. Vehicles also have a decent amount of damage detail, but it's kind of pointless because you can't really do anything with them.   Kick shopkeepers for more cash. The sound is remarkably better than the rest of the game, specifically the soundtrack. At any time during the game you'll be able to play whatever track you want from groups like D12, Doom Man, and Stylbik. While some may be obscure, they're all good. It's too bad the sound effects and voice acting couldn't match up. Most of the game's sounds are flat and the voice acting might cause you to laugh it's so bad.   As you move through you'll be able to pick up a ton of unlockables, including hidden music tracks, videos, concept art and photos, though why you'd actually want to unlock any of it is beyond comprehension.If you're a fan of gangster and thug oriented action games, then there are much better options out there. Even Capcom's dismal Beat Down: Fists of Vengeance is preferable to this. The missions are vague, the fighting system is boring and repetitive, and there's little to motivate you through Grand Central City's rather limited geography. In addition to weak gameplay, the visuals are reminiscent of the first wave of Xbox games when the system released, and the sound effects aren't much better. Surprisingly, the game actually has a really good soundtrack, so if you're going to pick this game up, you might want to use it as background music instead of interactive entertainment. Considering the game costs approximately the price of a CD anyway, you might actually be getting a bargain here for the amount of tracks it comes with.", "date": "Nov 30, 2005"}
