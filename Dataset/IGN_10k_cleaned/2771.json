Fun, deep, and aesthetically pleasing, the original Punch Out is still remembered fondly by thousands of old-time gamers. The product of a dazzled '80s generation, the then Nintendo offering paralleled the ascending career of the young Tyson himself. Brazen, tough, larger than life, and simply the best around.Which makes it even more ironic that all these years later, Codemasters version of Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing finds itself on a parallel with the ex-champion once again. Slower, sloppier, without determination, and a mere shadow of his former self, the latest incarnation of Iron Mike's favorite sport is, to quote Tim Witherspoon, ~Terrible~.And it's not just a matter of what aspects of the game could have been slightly improved on to make for a better experience. Nearly everything you can think of in Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing absolutely screams of suckitude. Whether its the depth of the career mode, the Karl Childers-like visuals, or the skunk inspired control mechanics, locating a redeeming quality is a mission most likely suited to the likes of Alan Quatermain and his comrade Umslopogaas.FEATURESOne of the biggest selling points for Tyson leading up to release, was the inclusion of the most advanced create-a-boxer modes in the history of the sport. To its merit, it actually lives up to that and allows for far more freedom than other editors in the genre. The only problem is, that boxing creation modes have always been limited in the first place. So claiming to be the best when you don't have much to live up too isn't the most effective way to make your point.On the plus side, you can alter all sorts of aspects regarding your fighter's facial structure. Brow size, ears, jaw lines, and even eyebrows can all be manipulated through 10 or more different options apiece. Those kinds of numbers build an awful lot of flexibility on the surface, but when you sit back and really mess with the thing, its true colors begin to shine through.First of all, there are very few skin and hair colors to choose from. So while your ugly galoot may have a face to that's unique to him and him alone, the rest of his body looks like a carbon copy of everyone else. Offering more boot and glove colors than trunk choices, the strange omission of variety was quite the puzzle. Eventually we played with the editor so much that we came to discover that regardless of what colors you slap on your new behemoth, there's very little to separate him from anyone else. In the end, your new fighter will end up looking like on of Dick Tracy's arch-nemesis anyway, with the only real differences told through body mass. Whoopee.To top it all off, you can only have up to four created characters at a time. It's still better than Knockout Kings' one fighter deal that it had going in its last appearance, but come on now. If you're going to tout a feature like there's no tomorrow, you had better allow for a hell of a lot more room than four guys.The real pisser is, that other than the create-a-boxer feature mentioned above, is the only feature with an ounce of originality. Sure you can fight an exhibition match, try your luck at besting your top knockout times, or compete in the horribly crippled career mode, but why bother? Where is all the cool stuff? Where are the tournament options and boxer statistics? You'd think with as many licensed real-life professionals that Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing slapped together, that they'd at least include some kind of history or information on them. But alas, that was not the case.GAMEPLAYThey say if ain't broke,  don't  fix it; A credo that Atomic Planet should look into more often. While the developer definitely earns some originality points for trying to do something different in the boxing genre, it's approach was completely wrong. With a standard now forming in the digital boxing world, the familiar setup of games like Knockout Kings, Victorious Boxers, and the upcoming Rocky tribute, deserve at the very least a second look.Mixing the different punch types around and changing familiar modifiers to places we don't intuitively go to, the control scheme in Heavyweight Boxing is far from natural. Jabs, crosses, and hooks don't feel like complimentary punches too each other, as they are not apparently separated by arm. Confusing when trying to string together a combination on alternate hands (especially when moving from conventional to southpaw), mapping the buttons to do the exact same thing regardless of which hand your boxer writes with, was not the correct way to go.Additionally, the pacing of the game is way off. While the bodies of your combatants may move around the squared circle in a slothian mating dance, their hands zip through each other's heads at blistering speeds. Formulating a bizarrely surreal combination of fast and slow, the ability to get into a groove is completely demolished. Why does the upper half move 11 times fast than the lower half? It's mind-boggling!Not to mention the fact that there's very little strategy involved for winning a fight. Instead of ducking, weaving, and jabbing from the outside to set up your more powerful super combos, you are forced to stick with hooks and uppercuts almost exclusively. Rendering all your extra punches virtually useless, this unrealistic approach to make things more power-oriented backfires into a conglomeration of frustration. Where's the fun in throwing 150 right hooks to the head of some chump before he does the same to you? It's not a boxing game; it's a contest to see which player can tap the same button repeatedly in order to win.    Well, if you're playing as a pre-created fighter that is. Next to impossible to win fights against the better boxers with your own creation until much later in the game, the whole ~buy skills to make your guy better~ approach could have been a great idea. If only the developers had decided to let you start with a few special skills and abilities from the outset. Denying completely any kind of ability beyond the default low-stats, you are basically coaxed into losing an ass load of bouts before finally being able to afford a slight jab increase. Not fun at all.If anything, we have to give Atomic Planet props for changing the way you get up from a knockdown though. Requiring you to alternate between buttons based on how much damage you have sustained, the new method will keep you aware when trying to raise yourself back to your feet. Not to say that we still don't prefer the traditional single button approach (which we do), but at least the programmers got away with trying something different without it completely backfiring. Way to go! We thinkGRAPHICSHorribly jagged and mashed together in some kind of Ben Grimm formation, digital pugilists have seen better days. Codemasters should have stuck with the character models it used in the PlayStation incarnation of Mike Tyson a few years ago. Better on the eyes and more natural looking than the polygonal beasts to be found here, a decision to go old school with a high resolution update could have made playing the game a lot less painful.But painful it is, especially when checking out the interspersed crowd of sprites and shadows. Divided by disgustingly large gaps of nothingness, the patched audiences appear to be segregated into two categories: The front three rows, and everyone else. An effect used to promote the illusion of depth, the failed attempt at crowd liveliness instead suggests the impression that the artists got lazy and didn't finish filling in the blanks.Worst of all though, is the animation. Skipping frame after frame after frame, the cut-and-paste-like movement of the fighters can throw even the most docile of epileptics into major league fits when viewing the chop at such a high speed. One of the first cases that we can remember where a lousy frame rate is attributed to the action moving too quickly, as opposed to slowly, the complete lack of fluidity is unforgivable. SOUNDComing off a title with a terrific commentary track (the recently reviewed Midway arcade baseball romp, MLB SlugFest 20-03), made listening to Tyson's lousy play-by-play all the more gut wrenching. Sporadic, inaccurate, and unbelievable to the point of exhaustion, Bobby Czyz and Ian Darke have never sounded more off.Comments about how great Tyson is doing after going to his belly twice in the previous round, remarks regarding the lack of excitement in the crowd after the previous 4-knockdown combined excursion, and a near-quiet reaction when calling the current action make for some excruciating stuff; Knockout Kings talks circles around this one.And what's with the audio effects? Miming the tinny metallic zing you'd hear when banging an oversized cooking pot, the repetitive thud to each other's skulls becomes too annoying after the first couple rounds. A temp track gone wrong perhaps, the grating dj vu will drive a normal person crazy within an hour, guaranteed.An all around mess of a game, Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing is officially one of (if not THE) worst examples of digital boxing we've ever seen. Wobbly and seeing double, the lackluster effort by Atomic Planet and Codemasters isnt worth the plastic it's printed on.On a side note: In a recent interview with ESPN anchor Jeremy Schapp after his loss to Lennox Lewis, Mike Tyson was asked if he'd continue boxing or retire after such a humiliating defeat. He replied, ~I dunno Jeremy, I really dont know what's next. Maybe I'll come back, or maybe I'll just fade away into 'bolivion'. We'll have to see.~ Hopefully, Codemasters will listen to Mike's latter advice and put an end this series before it's too late.", "date": "Jun 26, 2002"}
