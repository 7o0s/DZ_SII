Electronic Arts has been extremely selective in what titles it publishes for the Nintendo handheld, but the popularity of the series on the consoles, the company's strengthening and broadening of the EA Sports BIG branding, and ambitious GBA developers trying their hands at new 3D techniques on the hardware all combine to make SSX Tricky an ideal title to bring out for the portable system. And while the port isn't a terrible game, the 3D engine and hardware limitations on the GBA just can't match the thrill of the console, and the controls are much too frustrating for an wild and extreme sports game. Features 12 characters Eight courses Two gameplay modes Cartridge save (one slot) Only for Game Boy Advance Visual Impact has to be commended for taking on such an ambitious project. The team at least did their homework on the series when producing the handheld version, as the GBA design of SSX Tricky features a wide range of different characters, courses, and types of races. Players can either choose to snowboard down the trail in a ~showoff~ mode for trick points, or race against four other computer controlled opponent in a race all the way downhill. By pulling off tricks, you can build up the ~tricky~ meter on the side of the screen...and when it's all topped off, some super-spectacular high-scoring tricks can be performed.  While the actual skiing controls are solid, the trick controls are a little on the awkward side and wreaks havoc on actually performing well in the challenges. The game encourages players to push forward on the D-pad to increase speed down the hill, but if you happen to take air, it'll automatically assume that you want to perform a front flip...even if you're a couple of feet off the ground. And since there's no way to cancel a move once it's started, most of the time you'll be eating snow simply because you didn't let go of the D-pad in time.  The other issue comes from the game engine itself. Visual Impact has put together a decent 3D engine on the Game Boy Advance for SSX Tricky, but as nice as it looks on-screen, the engine definitely limits the level designers in what they can pull off in each of the eight different slopes. Every single one of the courses is a simple slope with the occasional mini and super-high slope, with rails scattered across the middle. There are no short-cuts or hidden routes to discover, something that was a staple in the console version's design. And as nice as it is to get eight different courses in the GBA version, the only thing that changes is the pattern of curves, hills and rails and the texture theme. The engine also has a very short draw distance, and doesn't allow for any really spectacular drops or objects to ski through. No bridges to cut across, signs to plow through, or tunnels to ski into. And during the races, you'll see leading racer sprites through the slopes...it must be difficult to provide sprite priorities in a polygonal GBA engine, because Infogrames' V-Rally 3 had this same overlapping problem.  The developer definitely tried to provide an extreme soundtrack for the GBA version of SSX Tricky, but it sounds like the compositions are too much for the sound engine to pull off...the digitized music samples definitely sound muffled and scratchy, even if the actual music pieces are catchy. Visual Impact's attempt at bringing the SSX Tricky game to the GBA is a nice one, but its control flaws and its limiting 3D engine hurt the overall enjoyment of the design conversion. It has all the necessary elements for a quality Game Boy Advance title: unlockable characters, hidden treats, cartridge save for the best time on each course. But the cons definitely outweigh the pros, making this snowboarding game only slightly better than average.", "date": "Nov 13, 2002"}
