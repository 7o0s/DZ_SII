By its title, Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure could be mistaken for a game that only a preschooler would love.  At first glance, Rhapsody appears to be too childish for its own good.  But in spite of the cute characters and songs, it packs more wallop than some RPGs I've seen.  Fortunately, Atlus knows the meaning to fun -- unlike some developers who try to cram in gory shock value instead of gameplay.   Best known for its Ogre Battle series, Atlus is also notorious for several other off-the-wall games.  Of these, Tail Concerto, Thousand Arms, and Bomberman Fantasy Race come to mind.  Each of these is odd in its own way; similarly enough, each of these is fun in its own way.  Is Rhapsody any different?  Not by a long shot.  Topped off with a cast of dolls, witches, and average humans, this RPG has enough adorable charm to enchant any anime enthusiast.   As Cornet Espoire, your main objective is to meet the prince of your dreams and fall in love happily ever after.  Sound cheesy?  It's not as bad as all that.  Along the way, there's plenty of adventure.  In the earlier parts of the game, the tasks are simple.  Your very first one, for example, is to search the nearby woods for a special kind of Inotium.  Before too long, you bump into Myao, the witch who has been bullying passers-by.  Her defeat rewards you with the Inotium you need.  Later on in the game, tasks rise in difficulty.  In one, you have to be the victor of a royal contest, so that the prince will choose you as his bride.  In another, you must collect five stones to save the prince from his imprisonment -- not a task easily done.   You are able to recruit several characters throughout the duration of the game.  Since you were born with the unique ability to speak with dolls, it makes sense that you enlist the help of dolls.  Unfortunately, they add very little to the story.  Their main purpose is to aid you in combat; other than that, they are pointless. Like most other RPGs, they can do all the basics: attack, cast spells, use items and special abilities, etc.  You are able to have three dolls in your party at any time.  Some are better at physical attacks, while others are better with magic.   The overall plot revolves around several characters.  You, of course, are the biggest part of the story.  Others that you will encounter during the game are:  Kururu:  With you as always is Kururu, the magical fairy doll with the ability to speak to humans.   She means well, but if she isn't getting you into trouble, she's causing mischief in some other way.  Although she doesn't fight in your party, she's always around to add something to the conversation.  Etoile Rosenqueen:  She's the narcissistic character of the bunch, and is ever the rival of Cornet and friends.  Sometimes it seems that she has a heart, but that doesn't last for long.  She tries her hardest to put Cornet down, and will stop at nothing to steal the show.  Everyone appears to love her because she's rich and beautiful.  Prince Ferdinand  The target of Cornet's affection.  He's in her dreams and in her heart.  She'll do whatever it takes to make him hers!  He saves her life in the beginning of the game, which sets her heart aflutter.  Unfortunately, big trouble befalls the prince, and Cornet will have to be the one to save him!  Marjoly and gang  She claims to be much younger than she is in reality.  Her appearance, despite her age,  is a dead give-away that she's well-learned in the arts of magic.  She leads a gang of three other minions, which includes Myao, Gao, and Crowdia.    The game world is spread out into many areas located all throughout Marl's Kingdom.   There's your fiery region complete with a volcano, your wintry region, your tree-infested region, and of course, your frog region.  In each of these places there are towns, castles, caves, and many other sections for you to explore.  Every now and then during her travels, Cornet will sing a song, hence the name ~A Musical Adventure~.  Usually her songs revolve around love.  To a younger audience, the music will be something special.  But to someone over the age of 12?  Don't count on it.   Not that the songs are poorly written or that the tunes themselves are unbearable.  It's the whole mushy-gushy-love thing that turns me off to it.  And if you're a male gamer, I'm sure you'll agree.  Having to listen to a 16-year old sing to dolls about embracing love is no picnic for many of us.  Kids will enjoy hearing Cornet's voice, but the rest of us will reach for the ~mute~ button.   Music plays a pretty big role in Rhapsody.  Other than random songs, Cornet is equipped with her trusty horn, which is both an instrument of sound and war.  In town she can play her horn to earn Inotium as a tip.  During battle, however, she uses it to injure her enemies.  Only her companions, such as the egg-type dolls, wield objects such as axes.  In fact, you are unable to buy or find new weapons whatsoever.  The only equippable items you may purchase are accessories, which boost your attributes in several ways, such as attack power, magic power, agility, etc.   When you engage in combat, you cannot attack your enemies right off  -- you have to move close enough to your foes in order to strike.  When you choose to move a character, tiles on the screen become highlighted.  Simply enough, these highlighted tiles are the only ones that you may move to.  Once you have moved, you may choose to fight, cast magic, use items or special abilities, or end your turn.  Each character has its own limitations to where it can move.  Some are able to travel far on the battlefield, while others are limited to a select few spaces.   Unfortunately, battles are way too easy.  Regular enemies never put up much of a fight, and bosses are beaten after a few rounds of a little heavy-duty thwackin'.  Even though you are able to choose the game's difficulty, the ~Hard~ setting doesn't offer much more challenge.  Leveling up is quick because beating baddies takes seconds, and your party members dish out a lot of damage.  Once a character levels up, he or she regains full HP and MP.  Sharte, the first doll to join you, is a big asset late in the game with spells like the extremely powerful ~Giga Holy~.  Battles become pretty meaningless when Sharte can just fry everyone during the first round.   Rhapsody's graphics are pleasing, but they're not spectacular.  Although there is some well-done background art, the sprites themselves are typical.  The battle graphics especially lack ambience.  Some of the magic spells were poorly crafted, and the enemies and characters look reminiscent of the style seen in the Breath of Fire series.  Although that's not bad, it does mean that Rhapsody isn't as gorgeous as Final Fantasy 8, or its kin.   The hand-drawn pictures found in random treasure chests are nice.  This idea is similar to Tail Concerto, in which pieces of collectable pictures were spread all over the place.  The landscapes are pretty, but Rhapsody doesn't break new visual barriers.  The style is very much oldschool, similar to a Super Nintendo RPG.  Like Final Fantasy 6 or Playstation's own Wild Arms, everything is viewed from an overhead perspective.  Battles change, however, to a slanted 3/4 overhead view.   The music is standard for RPGs.  Like the graphics, it's pleasing, but not spectacular.  The tunes accompany the game's atmosphere appropriately and aid the overall mood.  The sound effects range from cheap explosions to odd magic noises.  What will catch your ears the most, though, are the songs.  Love them or hate them, they're going to stand out like a sore thumb.  Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure is, like most other Atlus games I've played, too short.  It's got the right stuff, though.  It's fun, it's quirky, and above all, original.  Kids will have a blast with this beginner's RPG;  the songs, characters, and setting may very well win them over as role-playing gamers(as if Pokemon didn't).  We older gamers, on the flip-side, will yearn for a little more.  That doesn't mean that Rhapsody isn't above average.  Quite the contrary!  Older gamers have just come to expect a lot more out of their purchases.  You'd be lucky to milk 20 hours out of this one, and I'm being nice.", "date": "Jun 29, 2000"}
