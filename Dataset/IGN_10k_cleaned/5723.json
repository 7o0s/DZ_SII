That quirky little title zeroes in on the perfect absurdity of the source material, allowing you to interact with a cast of galactic misfits and solve puzzles in the most bizarro way possible. Vogon Planet Destructor, on the other hand, is pure cash cow. It's a top-down shooter loosely connected to the movie, save for a few in-game power-ups that bear the name of items from the book. It's actually not a bad game, per se -- just an uninspired one that seems like it was built simply to grab a few extra bucks from fans.   As the pilot of a Vogon demolition ship, you must destroy five planets in order to complete a hyperspace highway. The game is divided up into five segments (one for each planet) that consist of five short top-down sequences and then a 3D-esque gate-crashing run en route to the actual planet slated for demolition. Naturally, you will meet planetary defense forces as you clear room for the space road. The screen quickly fills with alien ships, spitting bullets at your craft at varying frequencies.   The shooting action is fairly run-of-the-mill. There are power-ups abound, such as Babel Fish will increase your weapon potency and crystals which can be used to buy cheats. This is pretty much the only place, save for the overall concept of flying a Vogon ship, that the game links up with the movie. You can engage the Improbability Drive to turn enemies into random objects like fried eggs, for example. The problem is, these aren't terribly strong links and after awhile, you just sort of treat them as regular power-ups.   Vogon Planet Destructor isn't exactly the most difficult game on the deck, either. You can absorb quite a bit of damage before you explode. The 3D levels at the end of each planet segment as simple 3D exercise where instead of shooting things you have to fly through colored gates to reach an acceptable speed. Then it's time to blast the planet.   The game looks clean. The design of the alien craft aren't terribly exciting, but the clunky Vogon ship you pilot is an appropriately unlikely shoot-'em-up ~hero.~ Vogon Planet Destructor opens with a good theme, but after that it's all downhill.Vogon Planet Destructor is acceptable as a shooter, but as a companion piece for the film and book, I have to pass it over in favor of the Adventure Game. As mentioned, this isn't a bad game by any stretch -- the shooting action is certainly decent. But let's face it, this is a cash-in of the first degree.", "date": "Apr 29, 2005"}
