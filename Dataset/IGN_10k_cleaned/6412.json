{"name": "Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal", "name_review": "Animusic 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/11/22/animusic-2", "text": "A few years back, Wayne Lytle and David Crognal introduced a unique audiovisual experience known as Animusic. Lytle, Crognale and the Animusic crew come back strong with a new release suitably entitled Animusic 2.   Like its predecessor, Animusic 2 is simply what the name implies -- animated music -- but rather than sticking with the public domain classical bullstuff, these guys employ their own original electronically synthed tunes and do it beautifully with their custom created visuals. As Lytle puts it, Animusic is ~... music driven computer animation~.   What sets Animusic apart from pre-designed CG features is the process whereby each piece is created. Specialised software is used to create a virtual set and along with a music program, the motion and audio beats are coordinated to be played out in real-time and ~filmed~. Therefore, it is possible for each Animusic piece, it is possible to have them play or do other things rather than what's seen on the screen. Perhaps it's this potential that makes Animusic so attractive; however, this is not always the case, as you may see.   Mr. Guitar makes his return with a posse. Video 8 of 10   Visually, Animusic 2 does not compare with some of the gorgeous eye candy we've come to see in some Xbox 360 titles (Perfect Dark would not be one of them). However, the design style of each instrument and environment is rather secondary to the motion and sound being offered. However, one can never enjoy Animusic 2 from stills and words alone. To fully appreciate Animusic, one needs to watch the whole thing in its entirety.   Like the first installment, much of the fun lies in getting hooked on the small details and minor actions of each presented piece. To see a visual cue of each beat is always pleasant. As before, the designs and details of each piece are as good as one would expect from a cottage industry specialising in 3D modelling.   Luckily, Animusic 2 heard the whining from audiovisual-philes and features all pieces in both 4:3 fullscreen and in 16:9 widescreen. If there're any complaints about Animusic 2, it would be the laser visuals are still goofy, especially in 2005 terms. However, much of the laser krezziness (Lytle self-admittedly enjoys) is more subdued. If there is any piece with good use of lighting, it would be the Fiber Bundles piece.   It may be Mussorgsky, but there's a mean set of drums on stage. Audio 8 of 10   Naturally, the key ingredient of Animusic 2 would be its music. Lytle's musical works are all original, or as original as they can be. Of all the pieces, only the piece Cathedral Pictures features part of an existing piece - Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition was featured in the Animusic Special Edition as a preview for this DVD.   Animusic 2 features both Dolby 2.0 Stereo and Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound. Interestingly, the music is rather ~been there, done that~. One could assume that the first Animusic wore away much of the freshness that would've been expected from the second installment.   The eight pieces included on this DVD are Starship Groove (drums, other), Pogo Sticks (acoustics, percussion), Resonant Chamber (strings), Cathedral Pictures (orchestral), Pipe Dream 2 (strings, percussion), Fiber Bundles (percussion, other), Gyro Drums (percussion), Heavy Light (other).   A fascinating insight in how the programs behind Animusic works is with Pipe Dream 2. Despite being the same studio as the first time around, the change of music in the same setting is sometimes upsetting when one expects something new and refreshing.    Lastly, Wayne Lytle mentions that he's played Ratchet and Clank (all three of 'em) and abashedly admits that R&C's music might've had influenced one piece - Fiber Bundle. If so, it is influence that can only be positive. Fiber Bundle is by far the leading editorial favourite.   Acoustics with a guitar of Rube Goldberg proportions. Menu and Extras 9 of 10   There's a reason why Animusic 2 took about five (mebbe six) years to make. This is not because the Animusic guys are crazy, but they're crazy about being perfect. Animusic 2's wide screen and full screen, but rather than simply squishing or stretching the camera shots, Animusic 2 features tweaked shots for each piece in wide and in full screens. It's like writing a book report twice, but having different viewpoints.   Just like the first installment of Animusic, there are various bonus materials. However, the DVD features different bonuses for different pieces. For one piece, it might be a behind-the-scenes look (Heavy Light), while for another, it might be different camera views (Starship Groove).   This inconsistency in extras is both a bane and a boon -- it makes the bonuses very varied when you click through the first time, but on the same token, those tech-fetishists looking for a consistent view of each piece will be disappointed.   Lytle seems to be aware of his commentary style and he is much more active and lively this time around. He avoids much of the technical jargon and sticks with simply presenting Animusic 2 to a college crowd as opposed to giving a lecture. Lytle also covers much of production and points out some problems as well.   Again the commentary is an interesting look into how something like Animusic comes about, and it can never be dispensed with in a project such as this. Since Animusic 2 is similar in length to the first one and skipping the commentary altogether to enjoy Animusic 2 is quite acceptable.   The Pipe Dreams stage is revisited in Animusic 2. Overall 8 of 10   Hardcore fans of Animusic will not be disappointed, although casual followers may be put off; Animusic 2 afterall, holds no visual comparison with other eye-candy available on something like a high-end PC. However, the unique blend of audios and visuals makes for a quirky and fun little romp.   Certainly, this is a must-have for any fan of CG animation.
