In the early days, the action was strictly focused on driving the player from one end of a stage to another, collecting items, and kicking some butt along the way.  The majority dared to be cute, cuddly, and full of color, and the point was just as much about earning a high score as it was saving a damsel in distress.  As console gaming later burst into the realm of 3D, the stereotypical cartoony nature of the genre stuck, but the gameplay action evolved to became much more vast and diverse.  Landscapes were now becoming less linear and puzzle elements more generous.  Gamers have watched this very same pattern unfold with Ubi Soft's beloved Rayman franchise during the first two titles, and in this brand-new third iteration, the trend of platforming evolution continues in many great ways.  Rayman was born as a relatively cute, limbless, and friendly 2D character nearly a decade ago on the ill-fated Jaguar system, but most gamers will probably better remember his 1996 debut on the original PlayStation.  His spiky hair and floating appendages defined a style for the France-based publisher/developer Ubi Soft that stuck in the hearts of fans -- despite the fact that he's French.  In his sequel, The Great Escape, Rayman dazzled gamers with what is still regarded by many here at IGN as one of the absolute best platforming titles of all time.  The game was as gorgeous, stylish, and well balanced as platforming games have ever been.  And now, the happy hero returns in his first original Rayman adventure in over three years.  In fact, Ubi Soft has been in development of the title for well beyond four years now, and our expectations were running increasingly high with each passing month.  Now, the time of release is finally upon us, and Rayman fans around the world will be thrilled to learn that episode three, Hoodlum Havok, is every bit the quality action title that Ubi Soft prides itself on releasing.  However, die-hard fans of the previous Great Escape hit will need to realize that Rayman, like the platforming genre of late, has evolved with the times -- be it for the better or worse.   The Facts:   Travel through multiple stages across nine unique worlds ranging from the wooded ~Fairy Council~ to the nasty ~Umber Swamp~ and ~Land of the Livid Dead~ to help cure your poor buddy Globox  Power up with brand-new abilities such as Shock Rockets, Heavy Metal Fists, and the Throttle Copter  Packed with tons of in-game dialogue from talented voice actors as John Leguizamo (Globox) and Billy West (Murfy)  Seamless cutscenes and cinematics flow between stages to keep the story fresh and funny  Players score points to unlock extra bonus goodies such as cutscenes, outtakes, and a dozen extra bonus games such as ~Racquet Jump~ and ~Crush~  Play one of the bonus games, ~Mad Trax,~ with the help of a friend via the Game Boy Advance and link cable  Supports Game Boy Advance connectivity to unlock 11 bonus levels in the GBA version  Approximately eight to 10 hours of single-player gameplay  Single-player adventure with a couple of multiplayer bonus modes  Gameplay Go ahead and blame it on Conker if you want, but Rayman is no longer the ultra-pure character that we all remember.  In Hoodlum Havoc the first thing you'll notice is that the game has matured -- as mentioned: be it for the better or worse -- in both style and humor.  Levels are now darker, jokes are much more sarcastic, and to be totally honest -- we love it.   Rayman 3's style is still far from the raunchy depths pushed by the likes of Rare's Conker's Bad Fur Day on the N64, but the inspiration is quite obvious.  In the opening level alone, we hear jokes by Rayman's longtime friend Murfy as he whips out the game's instruction manual and says, ~Blah, blah, blah ... Who writes this stuff, anyway?~ The game never stops poking fun at the fact that you're playing a Rayman videogame, with other follow-up quips such as, ~You were much nicer in Rayman 2,~ -- as we accidentally punch poor Globox in the belly -- ~It's almost like you've never played a videogame before,~ and our personal favorite, ~C'mon, you haven't scored yet -- I hope you have better luck with the ladies.~    Meet the new Rayman and his powerful arsenal of moves. The storyline in this new quest has been told countless times in our earlier preview coverage, but for those who still have no idea what the heck a ~Hoodlum~ is, then listen up.  Rayman lives in a peaceful world populated with lovable critters known as ~Lums.~  Our story takes shape as one of the more evil Lums, known as the Dark Lum Chief, is accidentally swallowed by your good buddy Globox.  The poor guy was just trying to save Rayman from certain death, but now he's forced to live life with the evil Lum Chief bouncing around inside his belly.  To make matters worse, evil Lums crave plum juice; hence, Globox is forced to put aside his plum allergies and suck it down to appease the angry parasite.  The resulting Globox antics are quite entertaining, ranging from drunken belches to gas-inflated ballooning.  As his good friend, Rayman takes it upon himself to find a doctor to cure big blue bozo and cease his incessant moaning as he trails behind your path.      As one might guess, evil forces are out to stop Rayman.  They looking to rescue the Dark Lum Chief from Globox's belly too, but for a more sinister ulterior motive: to send the world into a state of darkness.  Your ultimate goal is to save Globox and put an end to the Dark Lums' evil plans.  Think you're up for it?  Oh yeah, and then there's the Hoodlums: a swarm of Dark Lums that dress in patchy orange clothing and appear in many forms.  You've got your standard rifle shooting Hoodlums, your grenade tossing Hoodlums, and even your occasional stilt-walking Hoodlums.  Each will have it's own specific attack patterns to keep Rayman gamers on their toes.  They're not exactly the sharpest tacks in the realm of A.I. computing, but they'll provide the moderately skilled action gamer with plenty of challenge throughout all nine levels.  Rayman 3's combat is fairly straightforward as platformers go, with the addition of new power-ups being a welcome treat.  The game definitely opens on a slow note, as poor Rayman doesn't even have a pair of hands to fight with, but picks up soon enough in the later levels.  As you progress, you'll be introduced to different colored cans that transform Rayman into a sleek and stylish superhero like we've never seen him before.  Quick, real-time cutscenes reveal him slamming his fists into steel spiked gloves, and then you're off to wreak some serious havoc yourself as your ~Heavy Metal Fists~ sling powered-up balls to destroy doors, objects, and Hoodlums alike.  Other power-ups include the ~Vortex~ (blasts of whirlwind air), the ~Shock Rocket~ (a fully guided missile), the ~LockJaw~ (a swinging grapple much like the one used in Rayman 2), and the Throttle Copter (a quick vertical boost pack for catching air).  Each only lasts for a quick couple of seconds, which is sure to annoy some of the Rayman 2 fans in the crowd who are used to having full access to Rayman's moves at all times.  This brings up one of the big design differences between the second and third Rayman titles.  The Great Escape was much more of a straightforward platforming action title, with a slightly faster pace and a bigger selection stock moves.  In Hoodlum Havoc, there's just as many cool moves, but they're now limited to 30-second bursts on average and are strategically placed throughout the levels to fit with the puzzle design of each.  For example, players must now search for power-ups that will allow them to swing over water or smash through obstacles that will then provide them with other power-ups to open an earlier door at the beginning of the stage.  Also, Hoodlum's levels are a bit smaller than those in the second title, making for slightly more interesting puzzle opportunities while simultaneously trimming down on the wandering platformer aspects.  If you consider yourself a die-hard Rayman fanatic, then keep this evolution in mind as you trek through the levels.  The new puzzles aren't the most challenging we've seen, but they're both creative and diverse, which is much more than we can say for many of the average similar titles of late.  Rayman himself controls just as fluidly as he did in his prized second outing, with responsive analog control and the return of his helicopter ears technique.  Just hold the A button to enjoy a controlled descent -- great for snagging those fingertip cliffs.  The combat system is even beefed up a bit this time around, as players can now lock onto targets by holding the R button.  They'll then be able to dish out energy balls straight ahead or in a curved path either left or right by tilting the control stick as you fire with the A button.  Holding A will allow Rayman wind up his throw for an even bigger toss to smash through the tougher objects and baddies in his path. When combined with his various power-ups, there's just enough depth in Rayman 3's combat to keep it fresh and interesting throughout the entire adventure, although many Rayman 2 fans might curse the addition of the timed and scattered nature of the cooler abilities.  Rayman shows off his new skills. Admire that pretty yet ominous sky. As mentioned, Hoodlum Havoc's level design is somewhat more claustrophobic than in the previous platformer, which is due in large part to the tighter emphasis on the power-up puzzles.  But despite the smaller designs, they're still every bit as gorgeous, diverse, and creative as we've come to expect from the talented team at Ubi Soft. Players start in a colorful wooded region, but later venture into much darker areas than we've seen in the Rayman universe before.  You'll tiptoe across piranha-infested waters in a foul, moonlit swamp on your way to do battle with a wart-nosed witch and her cauldron.  Rayman enters the stage via her outhouse toilet ... and does so while she's actually using the bathroom.  She calls him a pervert, and we would have to agree.  You get the idea -- all is not rainbows and butterflies this time around, and when combined with the new sharp-witted, sarcastic humor, we definitely enjoy the fine line of tastefulness that this latest Rayman adventure walks.      In the end, gamers can squeeze out roughly eight to 10 hours of quality Rayman playtime, not to mention a few extra hours here and there depending on how interested you are in the bonus unlockables.  As you journey through the single-player levels, Rayman collects items and destroys enemies for the sake of earning points.  Successive points build up a combo meter that helps boost your numbers, and at once certain totals are reached, you'll be awarded with a newly unlocked bonus.  Some are merely FMV clips such as specially created, comical outtakes, while others are actual mini-games such as ~Racquet Jump,~ a very minimal attempt to recreate Mario Tennis gameplay or ~Crush,~ a simple variation of the traditional whack-a-mole design.  None are truly exciting enough to keep you playing for long, but hey, it's surely better than no frills at all, and at the very least might give players a reason to venture back through the single-player quest a second time to rack-up more points.  Graphics Rayman 2's impressive 3D visual style really took gamers by surprise three years ago when it debuted.  Since then, it's still considered one of the prettiest action platforming titles in recent memory, with soft, pastel colors, warm lighting, beautifully painted textures, and solid animations.  As greedy gamers, we tend to expect such repeat performances in our sequels.  Thankfully, Ubi Soft proves that it still has the in-house talent to deliver the graphical goods once again in Hoodlum Havoc.  The game opens to a familiar palette of bright colors and terrain, but soon transitions into darker tones of brown, green, gray, and blue.  Character models are nicely detailed, as is the surrounding terrain.  Texture work is again one of Rayman's greatest strengths, with high-quality artwork mapped seamlessly all around.  Stylish cartoon architecture stretches high, far, and well beyond the actual reach of any player.  There's no pop-up or fog to be found anywhere, which is also in part due to the tighter level design in general.  The framerate is a brisk near-60 FPS and rarely stumbles -- most notably when the camera happens to zoom in and out of the action.  Particle effects are also quite nice, with brilliant flashes of light popping around the screen and keeping your eyes busy.  Hoodlums are nasty, but their homes are beautifully decorated. It's games like this that are sometimes even more fun to play simply because they're so much fun to look at.  Rayman 3 is a true visual feast for the eyes, and has few flaws even worth mentioning in the graphics department.  We've been looking forward to seeing what the Rayman development team could do with a fresh start on our ~next-generation~ consoles, and we're pleased to find that our expectations have been fully matched with a gorgeous visual package that complements the Rayman universe perfectly.  Sound In keeping with its visuals, the audio elements in Hoodlum Havoc are crisp, clean, and vibrant.  The game runs in Dolby Pro Logic II and sounds great coming out of all five channels.  Even the intro and bonus FMV clips are far from distorted or compressed.  Real-time sounds are varied, as you'll hear crystal clear whomps, cracks, and splats rotated into the mix to keep your actions interesting.  The music is also right on the money, with a return of the same wistfully romantic melodies intertwined with pulsating techno and house beats.  The entire game grooves and jives as Rayman jumps and floats through the levels, and the game's pacing is much improved thanks to the musical accompaniment.  But perhaps the best use of audio in the game is the absolutely wonderful and dynamic use of talented voice work.  Forget the squeaky vocals in the recent PS2 Rayman title -- Hoodlum Havok takes the series to all new aural levels of bliss. Actor John Leguizamo tosses out the old pip-squeaky vocal chords of sidekick Globox and replaces them with a hilarious set of new character dialogue that is exactly what the Rayman franchise has been begging for.  Gamers who found Globox to be overly cute and annoying in previous titles will be thrilled to no end with the comical exchanges and one-liners that have transformed the creature into nothing more than a bumbling source of comedic relief that puts even Jar Jar Binks to shame.  Very smart move, Ubi Soft.As a popular game series evolves over the years, it's no doubt bound to lose a few fans here and gain a few more there.  Rayman has definitely earned his marks with gamers over the years and boasts a significant fan base to call his own.  The anticipation for a worthy sequel has been running high for a long time now, so it may disappoint some gamers to learn that Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is not as quite the perfect platforming title that Rayman 2 embodied so many years before.  The levels are now smaller and slightly more puzzle-based, and sadly, the puzzles aren't going to provide a significant challenge to experienced gamers.  But that aside, they're still creative, fresh, and fun -- especially the first time around, and possibly a second.Whether you're a Rayman fan who can't get enough of the limbless wonder, or an action-adventure-platforming gamer who enjoys sarcastic wit, gorgeous graphics, smooth framerates, and creative character abilities, Hoodlum Havoc is for you.  Its biggest flaws come in the smaller levels and simplistic puzzles solved via timed character abilities.  But the attention to detail and quality alone presents a polished box of software that any self-respecting gamer should be proud to include in their library.", "date": "Mar 5, 2003"}
