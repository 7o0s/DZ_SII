They speak in funny voices, have great big beards and go on incredible adventures involving sea monsters, swinging on ropes and, of course, boozy nights on the rum. What's more, Captain Jack Sparrow is the coolest sozzled seafarer of them all, so surely a game featuring Johnny Depp's alter-ego should be cool too?   Not quite. Unfortunately Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is at the opposite end of the fun scale to its bedraggled, boozed-up pirate protagonist. While Jack Sparrow is all surprises and laughs, this is predictable, tiresome and - most importantly - it turns Depp's memorable silver screen adventures into standard collect-quest fare, spliced with a flimsy combat system. Like countless movie tie-ins before it, POTC is guilty of concealing a mediocre game - albeit a very nice looking one - behind the glitz of a Hollywood license.   Trying to use guns or knives in combat is a futile task - stick to your sword.  But before we focus on what's wrong with the game, a bit on the story. Obviously it's based on Disney's new movie but the plot in At World's End actually covers most of Dead Man's Chest too, from Depp's escape from the prison at the start up of the second film to key scenes from the latest in the series. Many of the locations and characters in the game will be familiar too, with players taking control of Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner as well as Cap'n Jack himself. Indeed, much of the game is spent flitting between characters as the story unfolds, but we'll skip the details for now for fear of spoiling your enjoyment of the film.   However, while the main character and backgrounds often change as you progress through the game, the gameplay - which sets out its stall in the tutorial - barely changes throughout the several hours needed to reach the end of the game. The Pirates experience has essentially been boiled down to a lot of sword-fighting, forcing the player to hack, slash and swipe their way through waves of enemies, all of whom can be dispatched using the same button combo. When you've cut through one batch of bad guys it's onto the next and so on. The end.   Visting locations from the film is one of the more enjoyable elements.  Basic combat - hack with the sword, punch and grapple - is spiced up with the addition of a handful of combos that can be used to dispatch enemies in next-to-no-time. Rather than hammering the attack button to wave your sword around you can mix it up by throwing a punch between jabs, or chucking them off the edge of a cliff (which isn't quite so easy as it sounds, thanks to awkward aiming). It's nothing particularly fancy but at least the combos provide a little variation. There are other weapons to collect too, including knives, flintlock pistols, grenades and so on. These pick-ups enable you to take out enemies from afar, although aiming is often hit-and-miss, even when surrounded by a room full of angry enemy pirates.     Thankfully the boss encounters, of which there are many are more interesting.  Rather than repeating the same hack-and-slash formula they're one-on-one duels in which you must parry thrusts and time your attacks accordingly. This is done via three lights on the screen - top, middle and bottom - which warn you where your opponent will strike next. Move the left stick to the correct position fast enough and the attack is blocked. Parry a flurry of attacks and you're given an opening with which to counter, again using the same system to strike high, in the middle and low.   It's a neat idea and certainly makes for a refreshing change to the mindless combat that's present throughout the rest of the game. However, after the first handful of encounters it becomes all too apparent that little skill is required to get the better of your opponent, because it's just a case of watching for the lights to blink on or off.   On a more positive note, there are (admittedly few) moments in game that don't require swordplay at all. Instead you're tasked with solving puzzles by pulling levers and dragging boxes around the level. While simple they actually provide many of the game's more enjoyable moments because they allow you to explore many of the lush looking locations from the movies. More importantly they provide a little respite for your poor button-jabbing thumb. Of course, the puzzles are by no means perfect: the character detection is all over the place sometimes, meaning you have to position yourself precisely in order to open the door or flick a switch. This is a real pain in the backside when the puzzle you're attempting to solve is set against a tight time limit, but after a while you begin to understand how the game works and make the best of it.    There are plenty of familiar faces from the film - even that chap from The Office.  The platform sections of At World's End - in which Jack Sparrow and company must leap chasms, swing on ropes and teeter along narrow paths - are enjoyable too, because the controls are tight and responsive. It's no Prince of Persia beater but it's enjoyable enough, although a bit innovation wouldn't have gone amiss.   Unfortunately that applies to the game as a whole. With its ham-fisted combat, repetitive gameplay and all-too-familiar bosses fights, there's not much that really stands out in Pirates, bar the glitzy graphics. The puzzles and platforming is enjoyable enough, but there's nothing here you haven't seen before, and done better.   There is one saving grace, however. Disney has done a fantastic job of recreating the style and flair of the movies, right down to the way Captain Jack swaggers and jokes. While the voiceover isn't spot-on it's not far off, and many of his manners from the movie have made the transition into the game perfectly.   Oh great, it's another tedious and overly long combat section.  The game's superb character animation is complimented by wonderfully realised locations, all of which feel like they've been pulled direct from the film. They're not particularly interactive, with set-piece fights they're purely for show - you can't get stuck in yourself - and some paths in the game blocked by clumsy invisible walls, but they sure do look good. It's a shame developer Eurocom didn't spend as much time polishing the gameplay as it did the presentation.Movie tie-ins are invariably the kiss of death for videogames and even Captain Jack Sparrow cant escape this time. Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End isnt a terrible game but it lacks any real innovation and falls short when it comes to being fresh and, ultimately, enjoyable. The combat quickly becomes and the boss battles lack depth, plus each level plays pretty much the same as the last. Half-decent puzzles and solid platforming sections help to alleviate the boredom for a short time but theyre really they're just fillers between yet more dull combat. The only definite positive in At Worlds End is the attention paid to getting film locations spot on and the excellent character animations, which are some of the best weve seen in a game.", "date": "May 22, 2007"}
