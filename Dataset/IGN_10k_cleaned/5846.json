Fans can smell as impostor from a mile away and if they detect that a licensed game doesn't know its stuff, they'll reject it immediately. Fortunately, Stargate SG-1 hits most of its marks as far as authenticity goes -- which may make up for the linear action with some eager gamers.   Stargate SG-1 slips you in the boots of Colonel Jack O'Neil, head of the Stargate team which passes through intergalactic wormholes en route to cosmic destinations where lots and lots of ammunition is spent. The television series certainly has its elements of violence, but we're pretty sure O'Neil didn't drop this many aliens in an entire season, much less a thirty minute mobile game.   O'Neil is the only character you'll control, but you will indeed come in contact with other characters from the show, such as Samantha Carter and Daniel Jackson. This will surely please fans, as will the presence of story-esque cinematics that don't offer much animation, but serve to advance a series of four stories. The lore is typical Stargate SG-1 -- visit a planet with a goofy-sounding name, encounter problems, and eventually solve said problems. But this time, with copious amounts of gunfire.   Our primary complaint -- and really our only complaint -- with Stargate SG-1 is that its action is absolutely one-note. You move O'Neil around the field, laying down such heavy fire that the game poses little challenge. Auto-aim makes it even simpler, as O'Neil will track his quarry without any prompting. This kind of repetitive shooting gets old on console games -- but gets old even quicker in a mobile game.   On a LG VX7000, Stargate SG-1 looks fine. The game really doesn't use many actor assets, but it does do a good job recreating the environments and the stargates from the show. The enemy aliens look like their celluloid counterparts.  I must admit my lack of familiarity with the license. I saw the movie and have caught only a small handful of episodes on the Sci-Fi Channel. However, it's easy to see that SkyZone either did its homework or has a couple of real fans on the team. The links to the show are good, it's just too bad the action is so repetitive. I became bored with Stargate SG-1 pretty quickly, and I suspect that only the most diehard of fans won't follow suit.", "date": "Jun 25, 2005"}
