{"name": "Namco Museum 4", "name_review": "Namco Museum Vol. 4", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/07/18/namco-museum-vol-4", "text": "After three collections of games you remember fondly from the glory days of the arcade, Namco has finally run out of popular American games to repackage. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Most of the games here, save one, are great fun, even if you haven't heard of them.  Pac Land will be most recognizable to old school gamers, and it does offer some pretty addicting gameplay. The original game required you to press two buttons to run - the faster you pressed, the faster you ran. This control doesn't translate so well to the D-pad, but it's still fun. Assault is also difficult to control. Like Xevious in a tank, Assault has good graphics and tight gameplay. However, control is achieved by rotating back and forth, and absolutely requires the Sony double flight stick.  Perhaps the strangest game of the bunch is Genpeitoumaden. While it never got a proper US release, this game will appeal to fans of the old side-scrollers. Take command of an undead Samurai and hack you way through multiple perspective levels of monsters and weird creatures.  The package wouldn't be complete without a shooter game, and Namco 4 has Ordyne. Fly a ship and blast flying dolphins and saucers. Pick up money and buy power-ups. It's an interesting twist on a tired genre, but considering this was made ten years ago, it's pretty cool.  The only real dog of the bunch is The Return of Ishtar. This mind-numbingly large top-down adventure game is incredibly boring no matter how you look at it.  Overall, Namco Museum Vol. 4 doesn't really offer anything in the way of famous games, but it does have enough old school fun to wile away any rainy afternoon.", "date": "Jul 18, 1997"}
