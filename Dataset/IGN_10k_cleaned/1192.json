For the first time in what we can remember in our Captain's log, a Star trek game has hit PlayStation, and not a moment too late. After Interplay's partial attempt years ago to bring the Star Trek license, considered a strictly hardcore PC gamers' niche game, to PlayStation, it took Warthog and Acclaim to finish it off.   And for the most part, they have succeeded wildly. Taking a nod from Psygnosis' Colony Wars, Activision has brought a first-rate space shooter with all of the Star Trek trimmings to PlayStation. The game has its merits, and thankfully it's not a watered down version of some ridiculously complicated PC sim. Gameplay Well, OK, perhaps that's not entirely fair. PC gamers like the complicated, million-button setups that Star Trek has brought that system for years, and now finally console gamers have a chance to experience Star Trek, but in a much different form. Star trek Invasion is a space-based combat shooter that is comparable to the best combat shooters on PlayStation, but don't think that the Colony Wars series has just had its butt whipped, by any means.  The game starts off with you, the player, taking on the leadership role of the Red Squad, a fleet of Valkyrie space ships assigned to protect the Typhon NX-85808, which is currently under the command of Lieutenant Commander Worf. Essentially, Borg scouts have begun attacks on Klingon ships, and the Empire's ruler, Chancellor Martok has given Worf full control of a complex mission including protection of ships, attacks on rogue Borgs, and exploration into a possibly bigger enemy attack. I'll spare you the story so that you can enjoy it yourself, but essentially what this all boils down to is fast-action 3D shooting.   As an Ensign, recently graduated from training, you take control of the Valkyrie fleet. The first ship is light and fast, complete with several attacks and features. Your arsenal contains the Type-9 Phaser, Type-10 Phaser, Compression Phaser, Photo Torpedoes, Quantum Torpedoes, Gravitic Mines, and Tractor and Pressor Beams. While the list of weapons appears long and exciting, the unfortunate reality is that you won't need many of these weapons at all. With just a few minor exceptions, you can finish the game using your basic Phaser and Photon Torpedoes.   Boasting a large set of missions set in a sweet-looking menu system that appears in rectangular quadrants on a white grid above a planet, players move through a linear game setup that often rewards players with bonus levels. For instance, play though a level and pick up on item or beat it in a certain amount of time, and instead of moving to level 15, you may have the choice to play through level 14a or 14b before it. The game is fat with levels, totaling out 20 in all, with tons of extras along the way.   As a predominantly PlayStation-oriented gamer, and after having played through all of the Colony Wars games, it was refreshing to take on Star Trek Invasion. It's a completely different universe, complete with different environments, ship designs, characters and storyline. Heck, it's Star Trek! The game is certainly complete in its rich Star Trek feeling. You see mid-mission cutscenes with Worf providing commands, and enemy faces appearing on your HUD to tell you that's you've broken some kind of accord, or to beware of increased enemy fire, etc, etc. Each mission is wrapped with intro and outro FMVs, too, along with your rankings. Players also will encounter Klingons, Borgs, Romulans, and hear the real voices of Patrick Stewart and Michael Dorn.   But some comparisons with Colony Wars, or any good shooters, are inevitable. Star Trek Invasion, in strict gameplay terms, is almost entirely flying and shooting. I mean, straight on, no bones blasting, and not much else. The sense of adventure and exploration is rather limited. While most folks will love this for the sheer fact that it's a Star Trek game, and that you can fly cool ships and shoot baddies into the deep of space, by the sixth of seventh level, you'll be wondering what else there is to do other than to simply track the baddies and blast away. Engage and attack, engage and attack. Even the protect levels are essentially just straight up blasting missions, with little variety.   Perhaps it's nitpicking on my part, but wouldn't it be great if more of the levels required you to use unique weapons of gadgets to perform a different kind of mission objective? To be fair, they do exist in this game, but the actual variance is slim to none. And while a bunch of cool weapons do exist, including the tractor beam and a repel beam energy lance among others, you could almost beat the entire game using your standard weapons.   What's more, the game is not easy. I hate to admit that a game is difficult to beat, but after the first couple of missions, the going gets hard. By the later levels, you'll be playing the same mission multiple times, just on the medium difficulty level, to progress. I always admire a game that challenges me, and I think that games should be difficult in smart ways -- in other words, in that they make you think and practice so that you become skilled in that game -- but with the amount of repetition and the difficulty growing each level, Star Trek Invasion becomes quite frustrating. Players must learn to warp and strafe a lot, and to manage energy to truly survive. It's no surprise that members of the former Colony Wars team created Star Trek Invasion. The first two Colony Wars games were nearly impossible to complete! In short, be just a little wary, this title isn't for the weak of heart.   On the more positive side of things, Star Trek Invasion is deep with weapons, ships, and levels; you continue to earn new ships and weapons as you progress, and including the sub-missions and two-player missions, there are 30 missions in all.  Graphics What's great about Star Trek Invasion is that it looks great. It's right at the same graphic level of the best of the Colony Wars games, and in many cases the ship designs are better. In each level you warp to various areas, which are generally filled with deep space environments, meaning that they're mostly black, but several of them include upper atmosphere combat and include various red and orange planet settings.   I was particularly impressed with the two training levels, with beautiful moving rings and a great set of psychedelic colors. This kind of color palette is extended through the game, and works well to balance the simple blackness of space. Nebulae and gaseous formations speckled the backgrounds in many areas, and the various Star Trek ships are incredibly accurate representations of their TV cohorts.   There are tons of FMVs and cutscenes, too. Each level has an intro and an outro, and in the midst of combat there are usually at least to two ingame cutscenes.   The engine enables what seems like dozens of ships on screen at the same time, with little to no slowdown, a big feat for the 2 MB RAM that all these polygons and textures are jammed though to get to your TV screen.   Oddyly enough, my two biggest complaints are about presentation. I don't need eye glasses: my eye site is right on at 20-20. I also have a big screen TV at home, so given that you would figure I could read even the smallest of text. Nope. The intro mission text is so small that I simply couldn't read it. Plus, it's on the screen for very little time. Second, the menu screen, while quite smartly designed, is so crammed together that it's hard to read anything, the small text making it even harder. Which makes me conclude that the menu system isn't so smartly designed after all.  Sound When it comes to the sound and music, Star Trek Invasion is virtually flawless. Everything from the real crew voices to the sound effects to the explosive music is just perfect. Whether I had my headphones on or was simply listening to the game with the sound up loud, the game had a great sound production value, and comes through in every way.   Michael Dorn's and Patrick Stewart's voices add so much to the feeling of the game, it's hard to measure. Both voices are so commanding and impressive that you feel like you're playing the TV show -- which is the point, right?   As for the music and the effects, both are right on. The instrumental and sometimes classical score creates a dire need to perform, and the sounds of the phasers and photons blasting, and enemy spacecraft hurling into burning balls of exploding bits are simply unbeatable. For hardcore Star Trek fans this game should finally put to rest the idea that a Star Trek game can't be made for consoles. With a few minor exceptions, this game has all of the great presentation, in both visuals and audio to put it up there with the best of the Star Trek games. In fact, it is one of the best productions of any game on the system. But I'm mixed on the gameplay. Through my time playing it, I felt that the repetition of the levels, despite the various mission objectives, didn't encourage me to continue. Plus, I wasn't 100% compelled by the storyline, either. I wasn't surprised by much of the story even at the end. While the two-player mode is a welcome addition, it suffers from some of the same things that the single-player game does -- the radar is small and hard to read and you oftentimes find that you're simply looking to regain your composure, and figure out where the enemy is. Star Trek Invasion won't displace Colony Wars from the throne of great PlayStation shooters, but it's definitely rubbing shoulders with the best of them, despite its shortcomings. If you have the burning need to blast things for hours upon hours then you'll love this game. if you love Star Trek, you'll love this game. But if you want a little variety in your space combat, try something else.", "date": "Aug 25, 2000"}
