Take down the most wanted gunslingers in the territories or challenge friends to real-time shootouts via Bluetooth connectivity. Gunslinger may not the deepest well on the ranch, but fans of hard-bitten Westerns like ~Deadwood~ or more celebrated classic like ~Rio Bravo~ will find a lot to like in this clever like twitch game.   When you first mosey into town, you're armed with just a basic six shooter and dressed in the most common cowboy duds. Your goal is to become a legendary gunfighter, so the first stop in the saloon, where the barkeep maintains a list of potential opponents. Challenge gunfighters to work your way up the ranks in the tournament or take on the villains of the Most Wanted list. Each successful shootout pads your pockets with gold dollar coins.   Punch has added an RPG-lite mechanic to Gunslinger by offering both a gun shop and a clothier that are happy to take your winnings. Buying bigger n' badder guns makes you a deadly force at high noon, but not every iron is necessarily a step up. Some guns are slower to aim, but they pack a harder shot. Lighter guns may be easier to quickdraw, but require incredible accuracy to put down that mangy dog on the other end of Main Street. The clothier sells new outfits, such as hats and ponchos. As you complete Wild West archetypes, your stats improve.   The gunfighting mechanic is easy to get your head around, but necessarily a cake walk to master. When you see your on-screen hand twitch over your pistol's grip, press OK to draw. Your precision when drawing affects who gets off the first shots. If you draw when your hand isn't necessarily ready, you give your opponent a second or two to get off some shots before you're ready to fire. As you progress up the ladders, failing a smooth draw is the same as signing your own death warrant. When you have drawn, a targeting cursor moves across the screen, swirling and moving around your opponent. When the cursor crosses the opponent's body, it flashes red. Hit OK to fire your shots. Speed and accuracy are essential here, because if you burn off all six shots with poor aim, you're a dead man. A headshot guarantees an instant win, but a few good shots to the chest can also lead to victory.   If your aim is too wild, you can actually stop into the saloon and clam nerves with a drink or a dance with one of the ladies of ill-repute. This is a nice addition and it shows that somebody over at Punch actually watches a few Westerns.   The Bluetooth multiplayer is extremely cool. When you put both devices in a search mode, you'll pair up and hit the dusty street for a good ol' shooting match. I questioned in my preview how many players would actually use it, but Punch has included a neat feature that lets you share the game and get other gamers interested.    Gunslinger looks good -- I tested it on a Sony Ericsson w810i. Punch's artist takes a cue from the close-ups in the Man With No Name movies -- such as the still-awesome shootout at the cemetery that caps ~The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly~ -- and shows you the eyes of your opponent as the gunfight begins. The game has some solid gunshot effects.  At I mentioned in the review, there isn't exactly a lot of depth to Gunslinger -- the shooting is what it is, and some players might find the game too basic to retain their interest for very long. But I'd venture that Punch crafted this more with the bonafide Western fan in mind, so if you're like me and enjoy this classic American genre, you'll get a lot more out of Gunslinger than a person that doesn't quite get the appeal of John Wayne.", "date": "May 22, 2007"}
