The game spat in the face of previous Myst titles and set off in a bold new direction. On the surface, the changes Cyan made to the Myst formula seemed purely cosmetic. Instead of viewing the gameworld through a fixed first person camera, Uru rendered your avatar in full 3D and let players walk, run and jump through gloriously rendered terrain. But the changes went far deeper. The story written for Uru explored an entirely new aspect of the Myst universe. And the puzzles, arguably the most important aspect of any adventure game, went through a fundamental transformation.    And now it's all over. Two expansions and one failed online project later, the Uru series has ended. Well, did it work? After playing Uru: Path of the Shell, the latest and last expansion, the answer is, unquestionably, yes. Path of the Shell closes the spin-off series with gusto. It's mysterious and satisfying. It fulfills its promise of delivering an immersive, unforgettable journey. It even delivers a few great surprises for old-school Myst nuts. It's an adventure gamer's wet dream. Maybe I'm just that nerdy, but I loved it. Everything just worked the way it should. A few of the puzzles roasted my mind ever so slightly, but most called for logical solutions. No abstract views of alien physics required.   A few of the puzzles did require near inhuman levels of patience. You actually have to sit and watch the screen for more than ten minutes to solve one of them. And if you didn't know that you needed to sit there waiting(the game never explains why) then you're out of luck. You'll find your nose buried in a walkthrough in bitter frustration. Most of the puzzles require you to scour a collection of writings, so don't buy this game if you hate reading. Personally, I found working my way through the game's several books and journals to be enjoyable. There's a ton of good stuff in there and much of it is well written and interesting. Also, you'll need to be super observant to make any kind of progress in Path of the Shell at all. You'll need to be methodical and thorough, and you'll need to visit and re-visit areas multiple times.      It's a good thing then that this is one of the prettiest games you'll play for quite some time. The visuals in Path of the Shell not only exceed those in any adventure game to date, it crushes them. You'll run past towering machines and wander through bleak canyon walls. You'll visit otherworldly islands, replete with scurrying creatures and swaying plant life. The architecture looks simultaneously familiar and strange, as if a human city had been re-built by a race of aliens. Sound effects and music in Path of the Shell are equally impressive. Both fit the game world perfectly. You'll hear giant trains spur to life and lumber down rusted tracks. You'll hear water splash around you as you jump in lakes and rivers or just walk through a shallow stream. Levers moan as you force them free and gears grind once activated.      But it's not the puzzles that drive you too keep playing Path of the Shell. And it's not the graphics or music either, although the game owes its sublime level of immersion to them. It's the mystery that drives you. The feeling of genuine exploration and discovery. This single element elevates Path of the Shell, and the Uru series for that matter, above most modern adventure games and seals its status as a classic. You want to look around every corner, go through every door and investigate every inch of game space available. Every piece of the world, whether it is a symbol etched on a wall, a diagram sewn unto a magnificent tapestry or a large island looming off in the distance simply begs you to come over and have a closer look.     It's also Uru's take on storytelling that plasters your ass to your gaming chair. Unlike most games, where the main character plays an active role (albeit linear in most cases) in the game's overall story arc, Uru has you discovering what happened to the D'ni civilization some 10,000 years ago. The game doesn't shy away from its archeological inspirations; it readily admits to being a very non-traditional adventure game within the first 15 minutes of play. You start Uru: Ages Beyond Myst on a desert with no idea how you got there. The game simply explains you were ~drawn~ there. You soon discover a large fissure nearby. In your investigations, you stumble upon the remnants of a lost civilization and the story begins.   I'm going to dip into spoiler territory in this next few paragraphs, so those of you who haven't played through Uru: Ages Beyond Myst and the first expansion To D'ni may want to avert your eyes. Here's a quick rundown of the story: The people of the ancient D'ni civilization escaped to Earth 10,000 years ago to escape some gnarly calamity. They re-built D'ni in a network of underground caves and flourished. They soonafter became pompous and foolish, to the point of using a race of demihumans, known as the Bahro, as slave labor. Eventually, the D'ni civilization crumbled. It fell apart internally, rotting both spiritually and physically. Years later, Yeesha, a descendant of one of D'ni survivors, returns to make amends with the Bahro.   Flash forward to the 1980s. A man named John Loftin has discovered the buried D'ni city with his friend Elias Zandi. The two go on several expeditions into the city and ultimately start the DRC (Dn'i Restoration Council) in hopes of restoring D'ni to its former glory. Not everyone's ok with this. Elia's son, Jeff Zandi, has a different perspective on restoring D'ni. He believes physically restoring the city isn't enough. Like Yeesha, he believes D'ni's restoration needs to be a spiritual re-awakening, not a simple construction project.      You spend most of your time in Uru: Ages Beyond Myst and To D'ni finding out what happened to the D'ni civilization and the restoration project. You find journals telling a story of strife, betrayal, discovery, and sacrifice. The story in Path of the Shell takes a more spiritual turn as you work to uncover the mysteries behind ~the Watcher,~ a prophet of the D'ni civilization and a deity known as ~the Maker.~ Of course, I won't say anymore, seeing as that would be equally mean and retarded. Suffice to say, Path of the Shell delivers. Some may complain about the ending. I know I had a few issues with it. But remember, Uru was never supposed to end in the first place.   It was meant to continue for years through Uru Live. Cyan promised fresh content every month: new areas to explore, new puzzles to solve and entirely new worlds to discover. Paying subscribers the world over were to restore the city of D'ni piece by piece. It sounded great. It was ambitious and innovative, but it wasn't meant to be. Cyan cancelled Uru Live months ago, killing one of the coolest ideas to hit the adventure game genre in God knows how long. Ultimately, the story is about healing and restoration, and how can D'ni be restored if there's no one around to do it? In short, the ending may burn a few people. But maybe it's not an ending at all...hmm...  Uru: Path of the Shell left me wanting more. It delivered an unconventional story through inspired visuals. The musical score, while limited, deserves recognition as one of the best to ever grace a video game. Sure, some of the puzzles were a bit too unconventional, but most could be solved logically and they all fit the look and feel of the game world. Bottom line, if you're an adventure game fan, chances are you own Uru: Ages Beyond Myst already. If you're unsure about the latest expansion, rest assured, you'll get more than your 20 bucks worth. Like any other adventure game, Uru and Path of the Shell require two things missing from many trigger-happy gamers nowadays: patience and an-open mind. And not because the game sucks, obviously, but because Uru feels like it's the closest thing to digital meditation we're going to get for awhile.", "date": "Jul 26, 2004"}
