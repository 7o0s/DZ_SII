We've beaten on the ubiquitous Orc soldiers so much that it's only fair that UbiSoft and Nival's latest stand alone expansion pack, Tribes of the East, lets players take charge of the orangey savages and fight the bad fight. A whole range of leaders who combine the best parts of both Genghis Khan and the Sierra Club add loads of personality to the new faction as they struggle to compete in the cutthroat world of Heroes of Might & Magic.  Unfortunately, as is so often the case with the Heroes expansions, we don't really get to dive into the Orc content until after we've completed an entirely different campaign focusing on stuff we've already seen. While the opening campaign features Arantir's war against demon and Haven forces and ties in nicely with the conclusion of Dark Messiah, it means that most players will have to wait a good twelve to fifteen hours before they can really sink their teeth into the new armies.   What's worse is that the designers get you all excited about taking on the Orc challenge by opening the game with a small tutorial campaign that introduces the Orcs. Then, after letting you get familiar with them for an hour or so, you're forced to play with vampires and skeletons for a few days. Even though the new Arantir campaign is enjoyable, it makes the whole Orc angle seem like a bit of a bait and switch.  Fortunately, there are some new elements in the expansion that aren't dependent on playing the Orcs. For one thing, heroes can now sacrifice their units for experience points. While most of the more thorough Heroes players are bound to find themselves bumping up against the level cap just through exploration and adventuring alone, the option to get a quick boost at the expense of numerous but useless troops (Peasants, anyone?) opens up some interesting strategies in the early part of each level.  Additionally, there's more room for customization in the armies now as most troop types have two available upgrades at their advanced buildings. While the decision to upgrade is always a good one, the way that you upgrade is just as significant. You can opt, for instance, to turn your Bone Dragons into Spectral Dragons or Ghost Dragons. The Spectral version has better defense and hit points but lacks the bite of the Ghosts. Some upgrades are more radical, even going as far as allowing you to switch melee units into ranged attackers.   Tribes of the East even allows you to retrain your own heroes. Simply visit a retraining shrine and you can dump your old, useless skills for others that might work better. While it's unlikely that anyone who's even the least bit interested in this expansion doesn't already have a good idea of which skill paths they like, it's still a nice option.  What's more significant is that you can use the marketplaces in your cities and those found on the strategic map to sell artifacts that you don't need anymore. It might be a tough call to separate with items that you're actually using, having six pairs of boots and only five heroes presents an easy money making opportunity. The cash you get isn't going to make or break your strategy in the end game, but if you can part with a few artifacts early on, you can definitely boost your recruiting potential.      Finally, there are now large groups of matched artifact sets that you can collect for special bonuses. Some, like Death's Embrace, only require you to collect four different items -- a cloak, a ring, a staff and an amulet. Others, like Power of Dragons, involve collecting eight different pieces that all match. You can see which pieces you have and which ones you still need to get by hovering the mouse over any one piece in your inventory. The completed set brings some cool new bonuses but the main benefit to having an entirely matched set of magic items is that you won't be pulling your hair out looking for that last piece. Unfortunately, that's pretty much the point at which we stopped finding our sets.  And after you've explored all that in the Necro campaign, it's finally time to get a little Orc loving. The Orcs themselves play very differently than any of the other factions in the game. For one thing, they don't use magic and rely on powerful melee units to get the job done. Sure, they have Centuar archers and goblin trappers who can strike from a distance, but for the most part, the warriors and Cyclops and Pao Kais will be fighting with their enemies face to face.   It works because of two special abilities. The first is the Orc Blood Rage. This new ability basically rewards Orc units with damage resistance points every time they engage in melee combat. Go too long without hitting anything and the Rage will bleed away. A number of special, unit-specific abilities kick in at certain Rage levels as well, further helping the Orcs to stand firm against powerful enemies.  The second thing that helps the Orcs deal with more versatile enemies is their profound magic resistance. Available as a general benefit and supplemented by special hero abilities, the Orcs' magic resistance means they won't have to rush the casters in the enemy's back line just to stay alive. It seems like it would create some balancing issues with multiplayer but we're confident that Nival can patch in some tweaks should those issues arise.  Visually, the game doesn't look that different from Dark Messiah. The new Orc stuff definitely fits the overall aesthetic of the game, and the new campaigns feature some great settings and improved cutscenes. There are even some new dynamic animations that take place right on the strategic map when you hit certain event triggers. We won't spoil them by revealing them here, but there are plenty of cool ~wow~ moments in the campaign.   Tribes of the East is easy to recommend to players who missed the core game and want to check out what Heroes of Might & Magic is all about. The stand alone nature of the pack and its thirty-dollar price tag makes it an easy buy. Those who enjoyed the original game can supplement their experience is they're willing to pay the price just for one extra faction and a new campaign. We'd love to have seen a bit more focus put on the Orcs early on because the campaign starts off feeling like an extension of the last game.", "date": "Oct 17, 2007"}
