No matter which group you fall into, Chew Man Fu should hold some appeal. It's an action-puzzler with a twist: you're stuck inside a maze full of enemies, items and walls, but the walls aren't so solid. You can, if you choose, simply go berserk and kick your way through any offending partition. But you'll have to have the balls to do it.   Chew Man Fu is the story of a monk, a young female monk living in a satirized version of ancient China, during the time of the grand and historical Egg Roll Dynasty. She's happily pursuing enlightenment when, one day, the villainous wizard Chew curses the land and steals the people's supply of fried rice. Not wanting her countrymen to starve, the young monk sets out to free the nation from the plague of empty tummies by challenging Chew in his tower full of mazes.           You'll tackle the tower one room at a time, in a style of gameplay that could be likened to such past Nintendo titles as Adventures of Lolo or Mole Mania. The focus is balls -- four big, shiny spheres. Each one a unique color, and all four are needed to clear each room. The orbs appear in each level, along with color-coordinated plates on the floor. Rolling each ball onto its matching colored tile clears the stage.   You can roll a ball forward or backward, and also around corners, giving you more control and flexibility over each orb than you might guess at first glance.  But the real fun comes not in the rolling, but the kicking. At any time you can haul off and strike the ball in front of you with a high-velocity kick, sending it sailing across the room. The speeding sphere will damage or destroy any enemies in its path, rebounding back to you after making contact with something solid, like a wall. But the walls don't hold up under repeated pressure -- if you're frustrated at trying to clear a stage with its default layout of dividers, simply send a ball sailing at them over and over. Under a sustained assault, the wall will crack, then crack some more, then crumble down completely.   It's a satisfying variant on an older genre that was more traditionally marked by its strict, uncompromising rule-sets, and puzzler fans should certainly give it a look. Chew Man Fu rolls on a bit faster, too, with its array of additional modes. There's a two-player version of the main quest. There's a competitive, two-player kickball contest. And there's a Create-Your-Own-Stage editing mode, where you can make your own mazes from scratch. That's a fairly rare and fairly novel feature for a title from 1990. .Chew Man Fu's appeal will be made clear to you with a quick glance at a screenshot or video --if you're an old-school fan of action-puzzler game designs, you'll immediately recognize it as a game meant for you. But that's not a huge group of players. For most, the gameplay here will be a bit too simplistic. So only invest your cash if you're fully informed of your own personal preference for puzzlers.", "date": "Feb 27, 2007"}
