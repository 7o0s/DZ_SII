Schools of fish hang in the mire, bouquets of color in a slate-gray world. A lone dolphin slices through the water, bending around huge, undersea rock columns. The dolphin is Ecco, and he is the last hope for the future of man and dolphin alike. The game is Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future, the newest offering from Sega and Appaloosa Interactive.  It's taken a while for Sega to get around to an Ecco game for the Dreamcast, considering that the porpoise was a main staple on the Genesis. It's obvious what they've been up to all this time: creating a magical, beautiful world for the dolphin to swim through. This is one of the most visually stunning games released on a platform to date. With a good story and great sound added to the great graphics, Ecco is one heck of a mood creator.  In many ways, it could have been one of those rare games that redefines what gaming is all about. The idea of playing through a game as a dolphin was pretty fresh when first presented in 2D. Now, in full, beautiful 3D, there's an opportunity to really get under the skin of the Earth's most graceful creature. Instead, it gets bogged down in difficult-to-navigate levels and general inconsistency. Add a mediocre framerate to the mix and you have a good game that could have used about six months of tweaking.  The tale that Defender of the Future weaves is engaging and well-told. Ecco is charged with the huge task of saving the planet--not once but three times during the course of the game. To do this, he must travel through streams of time to stop an enemy known only as the Foe. This takes the wayward dolphin to various different realities: the placid world he begins in, a nightmare vision in which man is in control, another where a group of evil dolphins rule, and a fourth where the Foe reigns. To progress through these realities, Ecco must learn skills, seek disguises, collect life and fulfill objectives to turn back the damage caused by the time-jumping enemy.  Where the game falls down is in the implementation of this story and progression through levels. Each level provides hints on how Ecco can advance to the next challenge. These are provided by Information Shards scattered throughout the worlds. The hints themselves are quite cryptic, and provide the only idea of what will come next.  My complaint here is not that the riddles are always difficult to figure out. They aren't. Instead, it's that they are too scarce. The levels are huge, and it's easy to get lost in them. Especially in levels with many tunnels to explore, it is hard to know where you've already been, since the textures look the same everywhere and there is often a lack of distinction in separate areas. More Shards could have helped point the way.  Another problem with story implementation has to do with misinformation. The most glaring example of this is in a later level boss fight. While battling a giant alligator in an underwater cavern, the hint helper tells you to force the gator into spikes that jut from the ceiling. I spent a good deal of time trying to skewer the reptile, when in the end the tactic to beating him was completely different. This sort of misinformation is frustrating and ultimately detracts from the game.  Don't get me wrong. I'm not advocating hand-holding. It is just as bad when games are condescending and over-explanatory. But Ecco is too far in the other direction. Everything is so open-ended that you begin to feel abandoned.  In addition, there is no progression of difficulty to speak of. The last levels of the game are easier than some of the very first. One level may take you five minutes to play through and the next will take you days. Boss fights are all over the map. The final boss took the better part of a day to beat (which is a good thing), but some of the mini-bosses in the last section of the game were way easy. This sort of inconsistency is baffling. I have always been of the mind that a game should get progressively harder and reward you with extra challenges when you get to the later stages. In fact, I was more excited about seeing the beauty of the next level than I was in actually beating the game.   In fact, this is one of the few games I would suggest playing through just to witness all of the levels. The world invoked in Ecco is one of the most gorgeous yet created. In many ways, it makes up for the frustrating gameplay. Ecco swims and dives through lush, beautifully rendered environments. Each is distinct and imaginative. In Ecco's world, coral reefs are aglow with color, the rock face textures are well-rendered (especially from afar) and the strands of seaweed bob lazily in the current. Everything is crisp and detailed.  The later levels explore more fantastic realms, and these are almost worth the price of admission. Ecco swims through the insides of a rusty craft, rockets through the ~streets~ of Atlantis, and take on the Foe's Queen--from the inside.  While some are better than others, there are 27 levels to choose from, and 75% of them are over-the-top beautiful.  Especially worth mentioning is the Hanging Waters level, possibly the prettiest level ever in a video game.  Ecco has to jump through tubes and spheres of water that hang high above the surface of the planet. The textures on this ~hanging water~ are beautiful. The water itself is a living thing, rippling and gurgling before your eyes. Remember the water effects from the Abyss?  This level boasts H2O that good.  Creature designs are also superior. Ecco's model is flawless. While the other dolphins can be difficult to differentiate, they are wonderful to look at. The sharks in the opening levels move and look just as sharks would in the open sea. (If only this team would tackle a shark sim...) Jellyfish float like bags of nothing, pulsing as they move through the waters of the deep. Anemone sway and flit, schools of fish move in unison, sea turtles lollygag near the ocean floor. The creature models help you dissolve into Ecco's world.   Later in the game, you'll run into alien creatures which are equally interesting. While a few are from the H.R. Giger school of design, the rest look like prehistoric amphibious mutants. Again, they add a lot to the later levels, as Ecco takes on the Foe.  Now for the bad news. Being underwater, there is plenty of murk, and this is understandable. What isn't understandable is all the choppiness. If you have the luxury of an environment with justifiable fog, there shouldn't be any problem getting a smooth-flowing game. But, somehow there is framerate drop in nearly every level. Especially when jumping above the surface of the water and interacting with textures, the game has a tendency to chug hard.  In addition to the framerate problem, there are clipping issues. Ecco has a propensity to lose whole fins into walls and rocks. He would also get hung up on surfaces and in corners. This happened in almost every level to some degree. Ecco would get stuck in a corner and became immobilized. Nothing could be done to free him. In extreme cases, he got trapped inside of textures and I had to wait for the porpoise to die to continue.  The dolphin itself is a lot of fun to control. Defender of the Future could have been titled Dolphin Simulator 2000 for the accuracy in which they relate a dolphin's movements and sounds. Ecco swoops and dives with grace and finesse, and it is a trip just to pilot him around the seas. The controls are responsive and simple to learn. There's nothing quite like executing a perfect triple flip and landing straight in the water.  The sound adds a lot to the environment as well. As I've said earlier, this game expertly crafts mood throughout. The ambient soundtrack pulses along subtly in the background as the gurgling and bubbling sounds of the ocean augment the experience. Every chirp, click and sonar blast is captured, providing a great aural backdrop to gameplay.  While there are many things to improve, it is difficult to dislike this winsome game. If I was a little harsh, it is only because it was sooo close to being an excellent game. The graphics themselves are almost worth the buy. Ultimately, if you enjoyed the Genesis title, you'll have a lot of fun playing with this one. And no matter what, there's something to say for becoming a dolphin for a day. Click. Click!  -- Chris Carle, IGNFor fans of adventure games, Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future is a must-play. Its unique concept and lush visual imagery are enough for a rental, at least. While it's plagued by some gameplay and camera issues, it's still a fun view into a world that has been under-explored in the realm of gaming. If you're an aspiring oceanographer, like a challenge, or just want to try something new, pick it up. If you are easily bored by games that don't involve killing, or suck at videogames in general, you'll be frustrated with this one.", "date": "Aug 12, 2000"}
