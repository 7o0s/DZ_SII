I'm not sure if they even know exactly what I do, since they haven't actually taken a look at IGNPC. I bring this up because two years ago Final Fantasy VII was released, and no matter how much I tried to explain where I disappeared to for nearly two and a half months, they refused believe that the answer could be that I sat in my living room involved in some game featuring magic and talking cats. I played the game like a drug on the PlayStation, and when I finally beat it, I was shocked to find that I actually missed the game, and even more shocking, that I wanted more. My friends couldn't agree less.Over the last year I read and peeked at every piece of information to do with Final Fantasy VIII, and pretty much assumed that it would be an even better, more polished of the original. I picked it up for the PlayStation version the day it came out, and spent the next week playing with the assumption that, once again, my friends would hate me for a couple of months (I warned them ahead of time in preparation). Unfortunately the tedious magic system, self-indulgent GF animations, and rigidly plot driven gameplay made me sad about the end product -- despite the fact that the story was still deep and involving, and the graphics and animation where even more incredible than VII's. I still played the game forever, but it just didn't keep the momentum of VII. Especially after having to draw another set of fire spells from an enemy, or watch a GF animation for (literally) the 500th time. I liked the game a lot, but I didn't love it, despite the fact that I kept playing in the hopes that it would eventually win me over.The upcoming PC version, however, had me really excited -- if they could just provide an option to skip GF animations, and finally put the game in high res where it belonged, then it might just succeed where the PSX version stumbled. Not only was this not the case, but this is one of the only times where I can say that the PlayStation version not only played better, but it (gasp!) looked better.Before we get to the problems with the PC version, let's have a recap for fans of the series: this time around, you walk in the leather boots of Squall, an about-to-be minted member of the SeeD team, and his fellow teammates in a plot that has more twists and turns than your average daytime soap opera. The game takes place in a pseudo-modern world of cars, boats, and future technology, mixed with a sort of psychic magic. Characters don't actually learn spells and gain experience with certain powers, they actually take the spells using a ~draw~ power from creatures, to either cast immediately or store for later. Using the draw power, your collection of Guardian Force creatures (something familiar to gamers who've followed the series), and an assortment of odd weapons, you'll set forth on a series of secret missions for SeeD. As you'd expect, it only takes a matter of hours before your new job explodes into a series of shocks and turns, involving you in everything from the assassination of an evil queen to discovering the true identities of your garden (as SeeD schools are called) masters. Besides veering away from the fantasy theme, the most talked about aspect of FFVIII is its smaller character focus -- Squall, his love Rinoa, and the evil sorceress Edea take center stage for a bulk of the game, with the collection of character providing some interesting support. Though some people have been turned off by the more romantic, movie-like pacing of the story, I thought that it was a step in the right direction -- mature, interesting, and filled with the sort of depth and character development that you rarely, if ever, see in games. The game ends up playing out more like a drawn out greek drama than a ~save the world from thing X,~ and as a gamer you're much more involved because of it.If the PC version was a souped up edition of the PlayStation game, then it would be a solid RPG with some big gameplay issues, namely the incredibly, achingly long battles which want to make up for in beauty what they can't deliver in action. Too bad the people behind this port decided that we'd be just fine with 320x240 screens that look like a blotchy mess when viewed on most monitors. What looked nice for a TV just looks unacceptable when compared to any of today's modern pre-rendered games like Nocturne, Septerra Core, and Planescape Torment. Why they couldn't take the original art and make nicer backgrounds, I'm not sure. Fortunately the movies are of a much higher quality than VII's, with little in the way of artifacting.The magic system takes a big drop from VII's wonderful materia system, a great idea that treats spells like items that can gain experience no matter who has possession of them in battle. The draw system means that anyone can cast any spell (as long as they've drawn it), but it also means that you're constantly spending hours drawing spells for later use -- and then using special abilities to change those spells into more powerful versions, and so on. Spells are completely based on specific enemies and not on gaining experience, and it really takes some of the steam out of the whole point of magic. Unfortunately, what this ends up doing is making you avoid spell use for anything other than bringing up your stats (you can attach spells to your stats to give you special attack and defense powerups, as well as up your general strengths). You'll rely on Guardian Forces for the bulk of your major attacks, and for your special powers and items. Guardian Forces learn skills over time and you can choose, from a list, what you'd like them to learn next, from upping your magic rating to giving you the ability to turn enemies into cards. The GF concept in FFVIII would be perfect if it weren't for one fatal, gigantic, horrible, gruesome flaw. The battle animations. The longest that I've seen takes about 35 seconds (I timed it), which doesn't sound that long, until you actually you start using it again and again, which believe me, you will. Take, for example, an average boss battle, which will take around ten minutes to beat. You'll usually have two characters delivering a near constant stream of GF attacks while the last character provides protective and healing spells. Before you beat that boss you'll probably have to sit through about 15 to 20 GF animations, each of while is unskippable. Play the game for ten hours or so, and you'll start realizing that you've seen the same animations literally hundreds of times. While the art staff should be more than proud of these stunning GF attacks, which take in-game animation to a new level, shouldn't they have at least thought that we might just want to get back to battle at some point?On the other hand, the card game is just as addictive as the PlayStation version - a mix of magic and Othello that will have players fighting monsters and playing anyone anywhere just to collect the entire set of cards. As you progress the rules will change and have higher stakes, until the game takes on a much more complicated slant than you initially realize when you first get involved. The fact that Square just ~tossed~ this in as an added feature shows that the team wants to up the stakes of RPG gaming -- it's a game complicated enough to stand on its own, and you can go through the whole story playing as little or as much as you want.If only the game itself were that open and non-linear. Unlike VII, which gave you a bit of freedom around eight to 10 hours into the game, you'll have to wait almost triple that amount before you even get the chance to step foot in the big world that the game takes place in. Though the plot drives things along fairly well, you still can't help but get a little itchy to explore some of the areas that the world takes place in. For some, the linear aspect of the game will drive them nuts, but for other they'll stay glued to the story and ignore the lack of free choice involved in gameplay decisions.So -- the GF's bog things down, the magic system isn't for everyone, but the graphics are fantastic and the music is stunning, right? Not quite. The 3D accelerated characters and monster look amazing. Details that you couldn't really notice on the PSX version shine on the PC, such as the first robot spider you do battle with at Dollet, or any of the GF animations, which are guaranteed to impress any gamer, FF fan or not. The CG animation is beautiful enough to make you antsy for the upcoming movie, and happen on a fairly regular basis. They even use an impressive effect where pre-rendered backgrounds come to life, while you still have control of your polygonal character. Camera zooms, rockets launching in the background -- even full-on war battles will sometimes happen while you still control your character, and it's as stunning as it sounds. The fact that the screens are still at TV resolution is really unacceptable, and let's not even discuss the wildly varying quality of MIDI music that ranges from ok to unbearable. Why the FF team pushes the limits on graphics and animation and is an aging dinosaur when it comes to music is one of the most confusing things about the series, and unfortunately things really come to a head in this latest installment. When you've got a near photo-quality parade sequence happening on screen and bleepy bloop sounds providing the soundtrack, it just makes you wish for an ~add your own CD music~ option.Speaking of which, the menu system once again shows off the designer's complete lack of concern for the PC version. It's identical to the PSX version, which means that the fonts look chunky and blown up, and you can't use a keyboard for entering in letters, using hotkeys, or pretty much doing anything but emulating a PlayStation controller. Seeing screens like ~Slot 1 and Slot 2~ (the memory card slots on a PlayStation) when you're prompted to save doesn't exactly bring across the impression that the porting team was concerned about pleasing PC gamers. Perhaps they just assumed that the game would be bought anyway, so why bother -- or maybe it was an effort to copy the PSX version in its entirety for those of us (all 3 according to the latest statistics) that don't own a PlayStation. Whatever the case, having to look at chunky fonts while moving around blotchy looking cards, then exiting to squint at blurry backgrounds makes me depressed at what could have been an incredible PC version of a solid PlayStation game. Sound wise, I had a lot of problems with skipping and slowdown while I moved to new screens, or in battle, screens, though my home computer was fairly smooth. Both systems had problems during battles with framerates, sometimes skipping, slowing or stopping for moments at a time for who knows what reason. Also, the overworld map ran at a horribly slow framerate on both of my computers, which is sort of morbidly funny considering that the PlayStation map ran smoothly. There is one caveat though -- the addition of Chocobo World, the PlayStation VMU game that American gamers haven't really had a chance to experience, until now. You can find special items in the mini-game (which takes place in a tiny screen and can be used while you surf the web or read email or... whatever it is you do) and then use them in the ~real~ FFVIII for your characters. It's a nice touch, and I only wish that the porting team would have taken more of these sort of additions into consideration.If you've seen the sort of stuff I review and enjoy, you know how much I love console games. It isn't with inbred FFVIII resentment that I criticize the game, it's with disappointment at knowing that this game will undoubtedly sell an incredible amount of copies with little effort on the development team's part. They could have made a few changes, taken a little more time, and really had a shining PC version that showed off the game's beauty, but instead it feels more like a matter of going the easy route. And the game suffers from it, so much so that I can't help but recommend that if gamers really want an authentic FF experience, they should play the much smoother, much prettier (gulp) PSX version instead. Things look up, though -- the PSX version of FFIX is already slated for October -- yep, October, so we may not have to wait very long to see if Square learns from its previous lessons with the PC version of the game.-- Vincent Lopez", "date": "Jan 29, 2000"}
