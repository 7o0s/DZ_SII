{"name": "4x4 EVO", "name_review": "4x4 Evolution", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/01/4x4-evolution-3", "text": "In the small circle of friends that I have had, I always knew I was a bit different... alright, I was really different.  As a youngster, while most of my friends were at little league, or playing soccer, I was at home practicing piano.  During my high-school years, my friends' after-school activities usually consisted of sports practice or drama rehearsal, while I was at my local 7-11 perfecting the Guile re-dizzy combo in Street Fighter II.  Then, came to our selection of vehicles; many preferred souped-up hotrods with noise-polluting engines or slammed import rockets with noise-polluting exhaust pipes.  HA!  Neither appealed to yours truly, as I dreamed of 32-inch tires, extra cab sizes, 4-wheel drive, a 12 inch lift kit... and I continue envisioning such thoughts as I cruise to work every day in my econo-box.  Thankfully, I can jump into a big-wheeled 4x4 monster anytime courtesy of 4x4 Evolution.  And racing gamers, casual arcade visitor to those car simulation fanatics, will find playing in the muddy environments a change of pace... albeit, a slow change of pace.  Developed for the PC, the Dreamcast version of 4x4 Evolution shouldn't have no problem translating the blazing visuals, no?  Well, yes and no.  The visuals have suffered no loss in the port from the PC.  Truck and SUV models are right on the money, and the tracks are huge.  Objects in the game are a bit simple and I would hardly call the visuals in the game ~blazing~ as demonstrated by the lack of sensation of speed.  Ok, you're not driving speedy F-1 cars here and while off-road racing isn't exactly about top speed, the game just feels slow.  It also doesn't help that controls make you feel like you're floating.  This is especially noticeable on those long distance jumps you'll experience while racing on a track.  For 4,000 lbs. of steel, the amount of hang-time you get after jumps would make Jordan stare in awe.  Not that I mind the jumps, as they add a lot of fun to the game.  It's just with the lack of speed in this game, the jumps seem ridiculously long.  And then there are small visual details like  ~triangular shaped~ mud clumps and pop-up of objects off in the horizon that don't necessarily ruin the game, but don't help the game either.  Despite the slow-paced nature of the game, there are certainly enough options and gameplay features that put the game high on the replay value list.  Naturally, you can start up a race quickly though there are some annoying loading times in between setting up and the actual start of the race.  In this quick race setup, you can configure what track you want, weather effects, number of racers, as well as setting up your vehicle for racing.  This is just a taste of what you can modify, for the real beauty of the game comes in the Career Mode.  In Career Mode, you can select from the major brand off-road vehicle companies including Toyota, Ford, Nissan, Dodge, Lexus, and others.  With each company you can have as few as 3 to over 16 vehicles to select, depending on the company.  Beyond that, the level of customization is startling... simulation maniacs will go goo-goo over how much modification can be done.  Of course, parts and kits aren't free as you have to race in several courses before you can even begin to buy some of the really nice stuff (like the $800, 000 Toyota Tundra Race Truck).  And yes, the modifications do make a difference you can feel when you start racing.  Speaking of racing, the gameplay feels like a simulation racer with some extra zany elements thrown in.  As said above, one can argue that the slow-paced nature of the game is due to the fact that you're racing with trucks off-road, where high-speed is hardly common.  Such as it is, it's nice to see some crazy jumps and cool shortcuts that enhance the racing experience.   The game allows you to basically go anywhere, as long as you hit the corresponding checkpoints in the correct order.  And when I say anywhere, I really do mean anywhere as I took my truck off the track and into the sea!  And the game allowed me to drive pretty far into the deep blue ocean before it ~tried~ to correct my position.  The freedom to go anywhere is pretty cool, but you can get lost quite easily... and that means also losing track of what checkpoint you're supposed to hit.  One of the most appealing features of 4x4 Evolution is the online play.  And since 4x4 Evolution has been out for the PC, Dreamcast players will immediately find competition when they connect online.  However, if you want to chat with players, it's best to invest in a keyboard since you'll have limited chat ability without one.  And when I mean limited, you have about 30-40 selectable messages that you can choose and that makes it very hard to chat (though there is always the handy ~I'm on a Dreamcast~ message that'll make everyone understand).  Hosting and joining games has been pretty easy, and the game plays quite well online with lag rearing it head only a few times. 4x4 Evolution is a mixed bagged of excellent options, decent online play, large environments, and slow gameplay.  The floaty controls and lack of speed will probably turn off most.  However, the amount of technical customization and online play will probably appeal to the sim-maniac in all of us, especially those of us stuck in rush-hour traffic on the freeway driving our boring compacts back home.  --Anthony ~Taking Donations for a Toyota Tundra~ Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 1, 2000"}
