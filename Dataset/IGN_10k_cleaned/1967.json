One of the biggest titles to receive the remake treatment was Pitfall, the classic '80s Atari action game that everyone and their cousins owned a copy of -- if you didn't know Pitfall, you weren't a gamer. It was great to see Pitfall Harry back in action on the current systems, but the game design left a lot to be desired -- as skillfully developed as it was, the level designs were too complex and the collision detection was too sloppy, making the game more than frustrating to sit down to play. And while the Game Boy Advance conversion from Majesco is nearly identical to the 16-bit remake of a decade ago, it suffers the same problems that are unfortunately amplified on the handheld.  Features Ten worlds Multiple levels per world Only for Game Boy Advance  Pitfall Harry's been kidnapped. Gasp! But that's okay, he's got a son with the same adventuring aspirations as good ol' pop, and so it's off into the jungle to find out just what happened to him. But keep in mind this -- while Harry Sr.only had to deal a few crocodiles, snakes, and scorpions, his son has to brave new territory with a lot more critters and hazards to deal with. Dad had it easy. But that's okay, as Jr. has a lot more technique than his pop -- yes, he can run and jump and swing using vines, but he can also throw boomerangs and whip enemies with sling projectiles. His adventure heads through the Amazon jungle, through Incan ruins and abandoned mineshafts, and it's all about getting through it all alive.  As much as I'd love to praise the game because it's a ~classic,~ I never really liked the original. The level design was more complicated for its own good -- the designers made the whole ~exploring the jungle~ thing a little too seriously by having the character run both in front of and behind the foliage. The problem with this is, there are plenty of spots you honestly can't tell where the level's going...it's all about trial and error to advance through the game. And the enemy critters such as the snakes and scorpions blend in with the backgrounds, making it nearly impossible to see them when you run through the level at top speed. It's a lot worse on the Game Boy Advance, since the screen is smaller and darker, so the enemies are that much more difficult to spot. On top of that, the GBA version has the same sloppy control as the console version...which isn't the fault of Majesco. The team wanted an accurate portable port of the game, and they got it. Sort of.  I think the most disappointing aspect of Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure goes way beyond the way-too-complicated level design, slippery control, unforgiving collision detection. I'm talking about the big element, the  addition that makes a classic remake what it is: the inclusion of the original game.  And the Game Boy Advance version, for shame, does not have the classic Pitfall. Trust me, I looked -- in the location you're supposed to find it, you'll find the classic scorpion sprites...but that's it. From what I understand, the omission is due to licensing reasons between Majesco and Activision, but this was originally part of the console version, and because it's missing, it makes the conversion much less complete.The only reason I ever bothered to play the remake on the SNES back almost a decade ago was because it had the classic Pitfall built into it -- the newer game was too frustrating and difficult to handle. And on the Game Boy Advance it's even more so, since, like Earthworm Jim, you have to play through the entire game in one sitting...there's no password or battery to save your spot in progress. But without the classic built-in, the game holds very little interest for me, since that element of discovery is taken out. As a conversion to a SNES game, Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure is pretty close...but the actual game just isn't a good one to bother converting.", "date": "Jun 14, 2001"}
