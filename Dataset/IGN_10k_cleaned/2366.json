When Super Mario 64 was released, other developers used that game as a model for their own 3D platformer. After Westwood's Dune 2 hit the shelves for the PC, waves of real-time strategy games immediately followed suit. And when Neversoft gave birth to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater a few years back, scores of extreme sports videogames using a similar design oozed out of the woodwork.   But Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 for the Game Boy Advance might take this a step or two over the line...I think we can safely say that the development team used Activision's and Vicarious Visions' GBA version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 as a direct model when moving the Z-Axis BMX design from console to handheld. Hey, if you're going to clone a game, Tony Hawk 2 is a great one to work with...and the developers of Dave Mirra 2 created an engine and interface that, while not as intuitive to pick up and play as Tony Hawk 2 GBA, mirrors the key technologies and techniques that made Vicarious Visions' skateboarding design an incredibly impressive feat. Dave Mirra 2 GBA takes a bit more to get used to due to issues such as loose controls and odd collision detection, but Full Fat and Acclaim have a quality Game Boy Advance title on their hands. It's just not very original. Features 12 BMX Pros Eight levels Two player hot potato gameplay modes Battery save Only for Game Boy Advance  Like Tony Hawk 2 on the GBA, Dave Mirra 2 is a marriage of 2D backgrounds and 3D elements that combine to produce a versatile, trick-based BMX action title. Using 3D polygonal models for the bike and rider, the developers were able to map dozens of  different tricks to the characters, all of which can be performed at any direction or angle.  The game features more than eight different locations chock full of vert ramps, halfpipes, spines, rails, and objects to leap off of. The game's design revolves around combo-links and item collection which earns points to the player, and when enough points are earned, more advanced levels open up to ride in.  Though Full Fat directly mimics the look and style of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 for Mirra 2, the game doesn't have the same tight controls as Activision's game. Where the skateboard feels a part of the player's body in the Hawk series, the rider feels a smidge disconnected from his bike. The physics are forgiving in places, but not so in others...land at a slight angle off a vert ramp and you'll fall on your face. But spin wildly off a spine and the game engine compensates your erratic turn and allows for a safe landing.  There's always a place for lenient controls...but in the case of Mirra 2, it's a bit too inconsistent. And it doesn't help that the bike isn't even represented when your rider hits the skids...for whatever reason, the bike just magically disappears after a spill, reappearing after your character gets up off the floor. Sure, the exact same thing happens in Hawk 2 with the skateboard, but a board is much smaller than a 20 pound bike, making it less noticeable when it disappears from view.  But with a little practice, it's definitely possible to learn the slight control awkwardness to actually enjoy the experience. Dave Mirra 2 has a high learning curve, but once that peak has been reached, it's a lot of fun to pull off tricks and combos in an extremely similar interface that Tony Hawk established. The BMX bike in Mirra 2 can grind along lips and rails...but if there's no inertia, this control mirrors as a series of peg balance tricks. With all the different moves to pull off, it becomes a challenge of seeing how high the multiplier can go with the linking of tricks and combos...just like Tony Hawk. A definite plus in game design: Full Fat encourages course replay by making certain locations inaccessible until the player uses more than one BMX character in the early levels...which means players can't just blow through all of the levels with their favorite pro and finish the game, and then put it away claiming the game was way too easy.  It's just unfortunate that not a lot of attention was paid to the two player experience. Don't buy this game expecting any real competition against your friend, since the multiplayer option is a basic ~hand the system to a buddy~ design rather than supporting link play. The Full Run mode is a simple challenge where you hand your system to your opponent after a two minute run...so he has to sit and wait for you to finish before taking his own turn. The Star Collection mode is a little worse, since the first player's turn doesn't end until he finds all ten stars tossed around one of the levels. When it becomes the second player's turn, he has to beat his opponent's time...on a different level. Huh?  The game flows smoothly in its 2D/3D engine...and if you've played through Tony Hawk 2, you know what to expect in Mirra 2. In fact, the background graphic design is so similar to Activision's skateboarding game it's easy to mistake one for the other...and for those new to the isometric perspective, Mirra 2 does require a trained eye to tell the differences in heights on adjacent platforms. Music-wise, the hard-rockin' tunes in Dave Mirra 2 are a cut above the usual GBA fare, but they tend to repeat themselves too early and quickly...but that's mostly due to the cartridge limitation. It's hard not to compare the two products...Dave Mirra 2 even calls attention to it by using the same user interface when picking a player and course before a run, as well as using an extremely similar drum beat and tune during the main menu sequence.   Acclaim's BMX title isn't as clean as Activision's skateboarding game on the GBA, but look beyond the awkward occurrences in the physics and gameplay, and you'll find a lot of fun and a good challenge throughout Mirra 2's eight different parks.", "date": "Dec 8, 2001"}
