No, not Halo (yet), but rather Microsoft's RalliSport Challenge.  I played the Xbox version pretty much all the way through, and I had very mixed feelings about the game on that platform, being more of a purist in terms of simulation accuracy.  When I heard about the game being ported to the PC, one of the things that made me hopeful was that perhaps the Force Feedback technology of PC controllers would be brought to bear to improve the gaming experience.  I also wanted to see if other enhancements, such as the missing in-car view, would make its way into the PC.   But what is RalliSport Challenge anyway?  Well, if you haven't seen the Xbox version, it is a fusion of traditional World Rally Championship-style Rallying (WRC), complete with pace notes barked out by a co-driver, and Rally Cross style head to head racing with 4 cars racing around closed circuits of varying terrain (usually ice, gravel and asphalt).  As a bonus, you also get the Hill Climb event reminiscent of the annual multi-stage, treacherous climb to the top of a mountain, making sure you don't miss a hairpin and fly off a cliff in the process.  The cars are very much the same ones you are used to seeing in Rally events, such as the Subaru Impreza, Mitsubishi Lancer, Peugot 206, Ford Focus, Ford Escort, and even the new Volkswagon Beetle.  A decent selection of vehicles with WRC-style paint jobs is available, but you have to unlock a fair number of them by progressing through the career mode of the game.  Some of the more notable cars are actually older cars, which have significantly higher horsepower than today's WRC cars, which are around 300hp turbocharged 4WD cars.   What really sets Rallisport apart from other Rally games is the graphics.  Take a look at the screens accompanying this review and take note, especially if you have the latest and greatest offerings from nVidia (which sponsors the game on the splash screen).  If you want to show off awesome bump-mapping features, real time window reflections, sun glare, outstanding lightsourcing, and vegetation which looks and feels real instead of just being 2D sprite cutouts, this is your game.  The bushes and grass even bend and sway as the car plows through them.  The cars are similarly polished with respectably high polygon counts, a few deformable parts and breakable glass, as well as visible occupants inside the cars.  Exhaust smoke can be seen billowing out of the tailpipe even as the car awaits the race start.  Ice never looked more real, with bump mapping to drool for making uneven reflections look exactly like the real thing.  The game is high resolution and high detail.  The trees which fade into the distance become softer in what appears to be a gentle hazing effect rather than the usual pop-up disguising fog.  The draw-distances are never a worry.  The track terrain is very unpredictable.  Some of the faster straights feature undulation and bumps all over the road's width, making the left or right suspension droop or get airborne, depending on the location of the dip/bump and the angle at which you hit it.  It all looks very rich.   Some compromises were made that I'm not too thrilled with.  The spray out the back of the car, be it snow, dust, or mud, is very unimpressive.  Compare real Rally footage of a plume of dust flying out from under a Rally car in the desert to what happens in the game and you certainly won't be fooled into thinking you're watching the real thing.  The dust wisps out from under the car.  For mud, you just see a few small chunks occasionally getting kicked up, and there's almost nothing in the way of snow spray.  There are also no water splashes in the game.   All the beauty that is there does come at a price.  While my P4 1.7 Ghz with GeForce 4 was able to roll along at 1024x768 and high details nicely when I was running Rally events, the 4-car Rally Cross style events were awfully chopped up.  I cranked down resolution and graphics detail, and ultimately a combination of lowering the sound quality of my Audigy Gamer board and dropping the graphics quality to the 'medium' setting gave me back the frame rate that multi-car racing was stealing away.  Oh, and I also turned off the other drivers' car sounds, very reluctantly.  Everything ultimately smoothed out for both modes, but I wish the game was better balanced graphically between the between solo and competition races.  Since 4-car Rallying is a requirement to complete career mode, you may find yourself tweaking the sound and graphics to get the frame rate to the point where you can drive competitively.   The sound of the engines is decent, but lacks oomph on the low frequencies.  The cars whine and there are some nice sounds of the car sliding on ice, squealing on asphalt, or crunching through gravel, but given the amount of WRC footage I've watched, it just doesn't add up to a compelling experience when compared to the real thing.  I think they could have done a better job capturing all the various 'extra' noises of a car kicking up gravel onto the underside of the car, sputtering as the rev limiter is hit while lifting the accelerator and so on.  Stereo is made good use of, especially when surrounded by cars if you have the other car sounds on.  It is extensively used during replays as well.  You'll become quite acquainted with the sound of breaking glass as it seems that it takes very little in the way of bumps to cause one of your taillights to shatter in sympathy.   My first experience just running a practice stage with my Logitech Wheel and Pedals brought groans of disappointment.  The console-quality vibration system from the Xbox was brought over untouched.  So, your powerful Force Feedback wheel gets treated like a simple Xbox gamepad.  The revs and bumps cause the wheel to vibrate obnoxiously.  The game does not supply ANY spring rate to the controller.  After running several tries with the springs totally slack, I went out to the Logitech controller configuration dialog in the Control Panel and forced a centering spring to always be active, and this helped immensely.  I also had to tweak the dead zone and sensitivity settings of the wheel to make the steering response tolerable.  It still feels somewhat disconnected compared to other PC sims, but at least this bridges the gap somewhat.   Damage can happen, and you can flip your car and it's quickly reset to the track (you can also hit a button anytime to do a reset).  The game will automatically reset you if you stray too far off course, and this can sometimes be almost absurdly close to the track.  The damage doesn't seem to affect your driving at all.  It's basically cosmetic.  There are no tear away panels or doors here.    Rudimentary car setup options are available, but they are quite coarse, with gearing set to ~short~ or ~long~ and suspension being Soft/Medium/Hard.  You can pick your tire type and even whether your steering is ~tight~ or ~loose~ (like anyone would REALLY want the latter?).  One big problem with this game is that the car spends way too much time banging and slamming against the top of the rev limiter.  The auto-shifter also bangs the rev-limiter hard before shifting.  This makes the car sound like it's suffering quite badly the entire drive.  I switch to manual shifting out of car sympathy alone!  Setting the gear length to long delays but doesn't eliminate this.  I hoped this one would get fixed for the PC, but apparently the port is faithful, problems and all.   Fortunately, the game is quite configurable for dual axis controllers.  Unfortunately, there is very little feel of being connected with the road, partly due to the spring rate, and partly due to the relatively unsophisticated physics model in the game.  I'm not saying the physics are wrong as much as they are short of the high fidelity physics models typically found in more serious PC sims.   If you loved Sega Rally, this is more your game than Colin McRae is.  The lack of proper force feedback hurts the feel, of course, but the car doesn't really have much sense of weight transfer, so throttle steering doesn't do as much for or against you as it would in more realistic sims.  If the aim of the game was to be more ~playable~ at the expense of realism, then it's moderately successful, as the game is quite easy to get into, but keeps the atmosphere light.    It's not a coincidence that it feels somewhat like a more forgiving version of Rally Masters, since the same development shop worked on both titles.  This is a game, which would play well with a joystick or gamepad in addition to the steering wheel, whereas more simulation-oriented titles are hard pressed to work well with more console-oriented controllers.   The courses were ported intact from the Xbox courses, which means they are all woefully short.  They can be memorized during repeated runs to optimize your time, which rather flies in the face of real Rallying, which requires excellent pace notes and solid focus and visualization skills.  In this case, perhaps that's a good thing, because your co-driver gets a 'D' grade for timeliness and accuracy.  I've lost stages because I slowed down too much upon hearing a ~medium right~ that should rightfully have been an ~Easy Right~ and I've also plunged into so called ~Easy Lefts~ that were anything but!     The scoring system is also rather unique.  You get a cumulative points total based upon how you placed, your time and how much damage you did to the vehicle.  These points, and not just a fixed number of your position, are added through the stages, which make up an event, and your points are applied to a large numeric scale.  Passing certain marks on the scale unlocks more courses and race competitions.   Running an event is like placing a bet on the table.  The points you earn are saved with that event.  Restart that event and the points are wiped out, to be replaced with whatever you get on your next attempt.  This can drop your score on the career scoring bar.  One way to approach this is to come back and repeat events once you get better cars, so there's a hook the developers used to get you to replay the game, if you really need the points.   The intelligence of the other 3 AI drivers is merely average.  After all, rubbing paint in Rally Cross events is certainly okay.  The AI will certainly cut you off.  It's also not very consistent.  In some races you'll see all the AI cars slow dramatically and be easily picked off.  But two corners later they rip through a hairpin at a speed quite difficult to match.  This unevenness makes racing them head to head a tricky proposition, as avoiding slamming into them is often as hard as keeping up with them.   Most of the time, however, you are racing Rally style, and seeing your ranking change throughout the course.  You know when you're in 4th or 3rd and know to speed it up on a given segment, and is usually the case with Rally titles, you'll see a little progress box turn red or green based upon whether you've gained or lost time relative to your competitors.      What did you think of RalliSport Challenge? Because I spent so much time on the Xbox version several months ago, the courses and 'tricks' to driving came back to me in a hurry, and I'm certain that this knowledge made the game seem easier to me than it would to someone new to it.  So I think it's fair to consider that the game's ~time-to-beat~ should incorporate many of the hours I spent on the Xbox version.  So I rate its challenge level as decent.   Ultimately, I'm hard pressed to identify anything different about the game besides the necessary PC configuration screens.  There is NO in-car cockpit view, replays cannot be saved, courses are still too short, the rev limiter bug is still there, and your expensive force feedback device gets turned into a vibrating gamepad.I realize all this reads like a negative, but for many people that should not be the case. If you're a PC or PS2 owner with Xbox envy and RalliSport Challenge was one of the titles you wish you had, you'll be very happy with this conversion.  It simply IS one and the same RalliSport Challenge.  It should also appeal to people who kind of liked the Colin McRae Rally game but found it too difficult or too tedious.  And of course, if eye-popping graphics are your bag, you should definitely check this out.   While PC Gamers rave about the grass and terrain in Unreal Tournament 2003, the fact is the Xbox was doing it a year earlier, and RalliSport just brings it to the PC to demonstrate that they got there first.My main word of warning is directed to simulation fans who care about car physics and realism.  This is probably not for you.  I know you're waiting for Colin McRae 3.0, so just be patient and hang onto your money.  If there are enough people with interest in a console-style Rally game on the PC, this one fits the bill quite nicely.", "date": "Nov 15, 2002"}
