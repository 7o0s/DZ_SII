If there was ever any way for those two forces to come together, GTA3 on Xbox, there would be a whole lot of happy Xbox fans. It only took two years and the reversal of an exclusivity deal between Rockstar Games and Sony for it to happen, but GTA3 is here along with Grand Theft Auto: Vice City in one tidy package known as the Grand Theft Auto Double Pack. For the price of a standard new Xbox game, you're getting the two biggest PlayStation 2 games of the last two years with upgraded visuals, better sound, custom soundtrack functionality and better controls thanks to the Xbox's Controller S. It's like a doubled-up Platinum Hits package for games that were never hits on the Xbox until now. The two games definitely show their age, but the Double Pack is still a very strong value.   Everybody from Ted Koppel to your half-blind great auntie Lizzie has heard of and gets the basic idea of what this pair of games is about. For this reason, rather than diving in with our own opus about the value and philosophy of Grand Theft Auto III's and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City's gameplay, we'll defer to the 80,000 words of wisdom dropped by El Capitan himself, Doug Perry, when each of those games was released in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Sure they're PS2 reviews, but there's very little difference in content between the PS2 and Xbox versions of both GTA games.   You can get crazy with the Grand Theft Auto: Vice City review first.   And then increase the insanity with the Grand Theft Auto III review to complete the picture.  Strategy Guide Available!    Know Your        Vices!   Everything you need to master        your Vices.

Get The Guide | Free GTA III Guide   Gameplay  There are a few enhancements to the gameplay and presentation of both games that are definitely worth noting. The cutscenes in both GTA3 and Vice City now feature full lip-synching throughout. This helps drive home the gangster-movie appeal of the Double Pack when you hear voice actors like Guru, Luis Guzman and Dennis Hopper giving life to the characters of Liberty City and Vice City. The heartbroken Thug with No Name is missing moving lips and that's only because he doesn't talk at all in GTA3. You even get a few facial animations here and there like a nasty scowl when somebody's about to drop some expletives.     The loading times are drastically improved in the Xbox version of both games. The 3-4 minute wait when you first start up a saved game has been cut by at least 68%. When you travel from one island to another in either game, the loading time is a matter of split-seconds. It happens so fast, and the new area you're traveling to is so complete already, that you wonder why the ~now loading~ screen even pops up at all. Whether you're on the water, in the air, on the street or on foot, waiting for a new GTA area to load is a thing of the past on Xbox.   The feel of the Xbox controller's analog sticks makes a difference in the way you'll play GTA3 and GTA: Vice City. We're not going to start a debate about which system's controllers are better, but the fact that there's less play in the Xbox's sticks lead to some more precise driving and fewer spinouts from overcompensating. Also the re-mapping of the controls for the Xbox controller is very intuitive considering how many different actions you can pull off in the game. The Dualshock 2's X button was accelerate on foot and in a vehicle for example. On Xbox the A button is for sprinting, the right trigger is your attack button on foot as well as your accelerator when you're driving. The Xbox developers at Rockstar Vienna mixed a little of the familiar (many of the face button controls are the same on PS2 and Xbox) with what Xbox gamers are used to. Managing your inventory of weapons on the D-pad is a nice touch and a great way to get around the Xbox's lack of extra shoulder buttons.     Graphics  The look of both games has been enhanced and this is the area that will receive the greatest amount of attention. The characters, vehicles and buildings have all been re-done with improved textures and lighting effects so Vice City and GTA3 look noticeably better than what you might remember from the PS2 days. In the city this means you can read more signs and catch more of the humor the developers intended. You can see the blow-up dolls of the Birthday Suit lingerie and novelty store when you're cruising the streets of Liberty City instead of just a jumbled blur with smaller jumbled blurs around it. Mundane things like functional ~Walk/Don't Walk~ signals and street parking warning signs are simply visible now and make Vice City and Liberty City feel more authentic. The improved character models mean you can see Tommy Vercetti's hands and functional fingers and distinguish hookers from gangbangers on the street when you're whizzing by. The stitching on overalls, the zippers on jackets, the wrinkles in fabric are all much easier to pickup now.  The vehicles come with plenty of shiny and glowing reflections and details that were previously only suggested are now clear as day. Dashboards can be seen even through the side windows of cars, the scratches on doors and fenders look like shredded metal and paint now and that area of the car will lose its luster. These improvements are significant but also to be expected now we're talking about Xbox instead of PS2.   Some vehicles, like the Comet (the Porsche 911 wannabe in Vice City) have even been redesigned it seems for the release of the double pack. It could be we're simply seeing things more clearly and that nothing's changed, but some cars really do look different.   Large (and important) pieces of the environment being drawn into the picture at the last second was a big problem in the PS2 versions of both GTA games, and it's been somewhat addressed on Xbox. When you're in anything faster than a delivery fan, you're going to notice the game drawing on-coming traffic and the buildings that line the street just as they should be coming into view. The draw-in is much quicker and happens a lot further down the road than in the PS2 games but it's very noticeable.  But you certainly won't have as many head on collisions and near misses (especially on motorcycles) in heavy traffic due to draw-in.    The camera is still just as problematic on Xbox as it was on PS2 and that seems to be due to the nature of the game. There are so many places where the camera can get hung up whether you're on foot or in a vehicle that the games look the best when you're out in open spaces operating freely. The animation of the characters is also just as herky and unnatural as always, so it would've been nice to see some of their basic routines smoothed out some.     Other than this, the stylized look of both GTA3 and Vice City remain intact and things like the vehicle physics are still wonderful to watch. The amount of stuff Rockstar North is showing is when they present both Liberty and Vice City to us is still impressive. If the original PS2 games looked great standing still, then the Xbox games look amazing when there's not a lot of complicated activity on screen. Widescreen support is another nice perk that can benefit any game.   Audio  The sound elements of both Grand Theft Auto 3 and Grand Theft Auto Vice City are improved with Dolby Digital surround sound that gives us the thump from the subwoofer and dialogue out of the center channel speaker if you have a 5.1 system set up. It's leaps and bounds better than the limited DTS sound processing we saw on PS2. It all makes a difference when the fuzz is hot on your trail either on foot or in vehicles. You can hear their silly commands to give up while you still can or their sirens blaring.   The biggest addition to the GTA franchise, the one that had many Xbox owners drooling when they saw the importance of music in GTA3, is the custom soundtrack functionality. All of the radio stations from both games are all intact with no new songs or shtick we could identify but the tape deck (cell phones were around in '86 but CD players weren't?) in GTA:Vice City and the CD changer in GTA3 make all the difference. Both work the same where you use the black button to rotate through the radio stations until you get to the changer or deck. You then hold down black and use the D-pad to switch to the songs you want. If you get out and get back in the same car your soundtrack song will continue playing from where you left off. It'll probably be worth it to boost the music volume in the game since many custom soundtracks don't play as loudly as the game's built in music.   Other than that, the under-the-breath comments from Tommy Vercetti in Vice City and from all the non-playable-characters in both games sound crisp and clear and will be coming from the appropriate direction so the immersion is definitely there. Likewise, the voice acting remains top-notch and is one of the strongest elements of the game.  On the one hand you've got a pair of old games that have been brought to Xbox with a little more polish and a couple of new features. But then they're also nearly as cheap as any two Platinum Hits games you could name that are worth purchasing. If you've stayed loyal to the Xbox and never touched either GTA game, then this Double Pack is obviously a sure-fire purchase for you. After this, the categories of people and their relationships to these two games gets pretty complicated. We'll try to simplify by saying it this way: for the 76 grabillion people who own both or either game on PS2, and aren't sick of them, and who own an Xbox, and who want to see how pretty this game could've been if Rockstar and Microsoft had made nice to begin with, you all should pick up the Grand Theft Auto Double Pack too. If you're outside these two major categories, you should follow your instincts.The question now that GTA3 and GTA: Vice City have landed on Xbox after all this time is ~where and when will the next Grand Theft Auto title land?~", "date": "Nov 5, 2003"}
