Pets is not exactly based on the PC expansion pack that recently lit up sales charts for the evergreen franchise. This is a mobile-centric game that employs many of the trimmings of the PC game, but takes a solidly different approach in an effort to create a whole new title. The 3D edition of Sims 2 Pets, which we're reviewing here, has some interesting concepts and cutie-poo presentation that attempts to set it apart from the pack. But there is a fundamental design choice that keeps it from earning Best in Show, a ribbon that still belongs to I-play's My Dog.   When you first fire up Pets, you are tasked with creating both man and man's best friend. After assembling a Sim from a limited character creator, you get to select your puppy's breed from amongst Labradors, whippets, mutts, and more. Pick your pup's color, give it a name, and you're ready to take it to your virtual three-room house.   At first, it all seems pretty straightforward. You play with your pup and give it a bath in the yard, feed it in the kitchen, and train it up in the living room. There are several meters at the bottom of the screen that offer real-time information on your puppy. A fire hydrant, for example, shows how close the pup is to going to the bathroom. If you're in the living room when the meter goes into the red, the pup will have no choice but pee on the carpet and then you have to scold it. Instead, you need to shuffle the pup into the yard so it can pee in the proper place. When the puppy's alertness drops, you'll know that the day is over and it must be put in its bed in the living room.   You can pet your sweet pup by calling it over and then pressing the directional pad as noted on-screen before the timer runs out. Teaching tricks works the same way. The more complicated the tricks are, such as rolling over, the more button inputs are required before the timer reaches zero. You must teach a puppy a trick several times before it gets the idea. After each successful lesson, you must quickly press OK to praise the puppy. If you fail to praise the pup, the lesson doesn't stick. The same theory works with discipline. If the pup scratches up your kitchen floor, you must scold in before the timer expires or else the pup's obedience will drop.    Each day unfolds roughly the same. You wake up and tend to the dog in an effort not to make the puppy happy, but to further your Sim's career. Huh? It's a weird design choice that takes the emphasis off the dog -- even though it's always front-and-center on the screen. You see, the more you train up and have fun with your puppy, the better your Sim does at work. After meeting certain goals and teaching your puppy tricks, you apparently do such a good job at the office you get a promotion and a raise. The raise allows you to buy more stuff for the dog, which in turn, helps make the dog happier and pushes you farther up the corporate ladder.   The earnings you make from your daily job (which you must do while the puppy is asleep or something) and the bonuses pocketed for completing certain tasks, such as feeding the pup the gourmet food for the first time, are spent at the per shop on toys and other goodies. You must keep your fridge stocked with food, your toy boxes brimming with new playthings, and the tub bubbling with new shampoo. You can also buy new beds at the shop so your puppy wakes up feeling fresh and well rested. Each food and shampoo has a different effect on hygiene and hunger. The better quality goods (which are more spendy) refill the puppy's meters faster.   The toys work a little differently. There are balls and discs you can buy to play with in the yard or living room. There are several different balls and discs, each increasing in color and ~fun-ness.~ After buying one and playing with it, you can buy the next one up the following day. To play with the puppy, you choose the toy box and throw the ball or disc by hitting the OK key when a moving mark passes through the green zone of a meter, kinda like a golf swing on previous editions of Tiger Woods PGA. If you hit the mark all three times, the pup has a lot of fun and everybody's happier.   You can always monitor your puppy and Sim happiness via a menu. You can also access a list of goals from the menu. This gives the game a little bit of structure, as you pursue the goals in order to keep getting those promotions at work and buy new toys and beds. Once you completely train up your pup and have all of the toys and beds, the game almost hits a wall. You can then start over with a new puppy (there is a hidden dog in the game, too).   EA Mobile says they were going for the ~aaawwww~ factor when building Pets. To a degree, they succeeded. The puppies are indeed very, very cute. They flop and jump, bark and pant. Even though the stylized visuals of My Dog are still tops, these realistic pups are a very close second. (That Whippet is adorable.) The game is extremely colorful and detailed. All of the rooms are bright, with lots of objects and clean textures.   The game uses Sim-lish for your avatar's interactions, like calling the dog over or scolding it. When you visit the pet shop and talk tot he owner for puppy tips, he also mumbles in that strangely amusing language. The puppies all bark, pant, and yip -- and as a dog owner, I can tell you that the sounds are accurate.  For as cute as the puppies in The Sims 2 Pets are, the game design always keeps you at arm's length. Putting the emphasis on your Sim's corporate advancement instead of the dog was a curious choice and the game suffers for it. I really didn't care about getting raises. Training up my pup for a dog show or to impress other Sims in the neighborhood would have been far more rewarding. However, without big goals like this, the game is less involving -- and thus, less engaging. You can easily put this pup away when the real world comes calling, and to some players, that might be a good thing. (I found Nintendogs to be a little stressful because I was so into the pixel pooch.) Should EA Mobile go for some sort of sequel or expansion, the focus needs to be squarely on the relationship with the dog. They have the cuteness down.
