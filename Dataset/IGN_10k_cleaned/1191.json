They may have a new lease on life as far as TV is concerned, but their shows have been a painful experience to watch for years now, their newer talent is hardly worth speaking of, and their biggest stars are just on the sunny side of paralysis.  At one point, Paul Heyman's promotion was the cutting edge of professional wrestling in America, with some of the best booking and action in any federation, but the talent drain has irrevocably harmed it in the last three years, and the death-watch is finally on them for sure.  WWF Warzone is dead.  It lost its hot license two games back, it was graphically eclipsed by the first WWF Smackdown, and the arrival on American consoles of quality Japanese-developed 3D wrestling engines revealed the serious flaws in its control and artificial intelligence.  Acclaim's response to being obviously outclassed was typical - slap on a new license, throw in some new game modes, retexture the characters, and ignore the fact that the game was still substandard in many significant ways.  ECW Anarchy Rulz, the latest and hopefully the last Acclaim wrestling game on the PlayStation, is as much an example of this phenomenon as its predecessor, ~Hardcore~ ~Revolution.~  Acclaim claims to have changed the game's control system, but I would like a detailed explanation of how, because it feels to me just like WWF Warzone (Attitude, Hardcore Revolution, take your pick).  There are still strikes, ready moves, and tie-up moves - from back to front, the moves you're too slow to do, the moves the AI does to you out of nowhere, and the moves you do over and over again because they're all you can get to work.  There is none of the visibly precise timing that makes the somewhat similar Fire Pro grappling system so easy to master, and unlike that or the positioning-based Toukon Retsuden/Smackdown system, the computer can manhandle you with no visible reason why you can't get a move in edgewise.  The wrestler lineup is ECW's, and modern ECW's at that, which means it's more or less for fans only.  The same rule applies to the game as the promotion - when Rob Van Dam, the Sandman, and Tommy Dreamer are your brightest lights, you're in trouble.  Mike Awesome is out, as is Raven, the Dudleyz are long gone, and Lance Storm's departure has left Justin Credible without a tag team partner I can stand.  Of the 34 characters, actually a somewhat lean lineup these days, there aren't many with much name value or interesting personality.  I can only see myself wanting to use perhaps Super Crazy, Yoshihiro Tajiri, and Masato Tanaka - the rest all simply bleed together.  There's one feature of the roster I'd like to train a particular blast of the flamethrower on, because it sort of symbolizes how bollixed Acclaim's understanding of professional wrestling is.  Not only have they included Dusty Rhodes in the game, they actually feature him in the game's press materials, as if his presence were some kind of selling point.  Never mind that he's one of the most grotesque specimens to step in the ring, hideously talentless even in his prime, which was over fifteen years ago.  Here is wisdom: DUSTY IS EVIL (tm & C Scott Keith, I think).  He is also devoid of wrestling ability and visually reminiscent of the rare Siamese-twin Pillsbury Doughboys.  I do not want to play as him in a wrestling game.  I do not want to ever see him in a wrestling game, or indeed anywhere at all.  The scary thing is, Anarchy Rulz actually does a decent enough job of replicating Dusty in all his jiggling glory.  It would probably take a next-generation console and a very talented 3D animator to do it perfectly, but as it is, it's still a good enough likeness that you want to flee in terror from your television.  The characters don't look or move as well as the competition, though - the models don't distinguish themselves in any particular way, I can spot move animations from back in Warzone, and there isn't much happening as far as a dynamic camera.  I don't like the move execution or presentation as much as Smackdown, with its well-done camera cuts in singles matches.  The create-a-wrestler system, at long last, has been updated with the ability to create a custom moveset for your wrestler, so that actually puts it in a pretty strong position as far as creation engines go.  Acclaim's wrestling games have always had the best selection of cosmetic modifications, and now that you can finally give your wrestler whatever moves you like (thus conquering an obstacle that Fire Pro ascended in the 16-bit era), it has an edge over the Smackdown and Wrestlemania creation systems, with their comparatively weak appearance modification options.  But then it comes time to actually play as the wrestler you've created, and things rather fall back down again.  Even the vaunted new game modes are mainly gimmicks nicked from the WWF - things like the dumpster match and the brimstone (read Inferno) match - and they wouldn't be fun in either federation.  You win the brimstone match simply by tossing your opponent over the ropes, and your reward is a barely noticeable fire effect.  Whee.  The atmospheric features have been improved with the addition of color commentary from Joel Gertner, to go along with Joey Styles on play-by-play, but the arenas and entrances look lousy - the crowd is terrible in comparison to the ones in both Smackdowns.  On top of it all, just like Hardcore Revolution, this just doesn't feel like ECW.  It feels like Warzone with new commentary and a little more blood (whose implementation, speaking of which, is ugly and unrealistic).  WWF Smackdown 2 comes out in a couple of months, and I don't think that's too long to wait for a better PlayStation wrestling game.  Am I being to hard on Anarchy Rulz?  Perhaps, if you happen to be a follower of the promotion, but I'm not.  I'm interested in good gameplay first and good wrestling just after that, neither of which Anarchy Rulz delivers in comparison to WWF Smackdown, Wrestlemania 2000, WCW Revenge, Fire Pro G, Six Man Scramble, Super Fire Pro Wrestling X Premium, either Giant Gram, and most of the Toukon Retsuden games (except maybe the awful Toukon Retsuden 4).  I'd recommend any of those games to a wrestling fan.  I'd recommend Anarchy Rulz only to ECW fans, and their reaction might only be to wonder where everything they liked about the promotion has gone.  -- David Smith", "date": "Aug 24, 2000"}
