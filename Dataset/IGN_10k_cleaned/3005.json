Be it the original game, Riven, or the latest in the series known as Exile, it's a franchise that never should have made it past the early 90's. In the days of DOS and 3.1, 8MB of Maximum RAM, and a slew of 2D side-scrollers however, I could see how the first edition may have intrigued a large group of people. It was the birth of the information age after all, and anything computer rendered, generated, or remotely taken from The Lawnmower Man was a hot property. Alas, Myst went on to sale more pieces than any other PC game in history, and up until recently (Thank you ~The Sims~), still held onto that record with an iron grip. But was it ever really that good?In all honesty, it wasn't. Take away the surrealistic still images and the enchanting soundtrack and all you had was a point and click slideshow with an occasional remedial puzzle. Truth be told, Myst is no more a videogame than this bottle of Calistoga that sits to my left. It's all about the experience of enjoying great visuals, an ethereal soundtrack, and an hour or two of cheesy FMV acting in a make-believe world. And while that sort of concept may appeal to a broader sect of people than myself, I am almost immovably certain that Myst III: Exile will not appeal to the console audience in the least.Story: Apparently a really big deal, the story breaks down to nothing more than a tale of revenge. The Brad Dourif character Saavedro has stolen Atrus' latest Age (loose translation: this one guy's book that also happens to be a world in and of itself), and its up to the player to get it back. To do so, you have to chase the bad guy through various other ages before finally cornering him for a most cold-hearted ending.The plot's rather pointless in the end, as it just serves as a device to actually get you to move from world to world, and has no bearing on what you see, what you do, or how you react. Nor does it provide any real motivation towards completing the game. Admittedly, Brad Dourif (That's Child's Play Chucky in case you're curious) and a reasonably hot English actress whose name escapes me play their respective roles effectively, and there's one or two moments of drama in there that had me occasionally curious. On the whole however, I've seen a more effective use of plot and characterization in games like Super Mario Bros. 2 from 15 years ago.Gameplay: I find this extremely hard to talk about because the hint of any kind of ~gameplay~ is almost non-existent. 90% of the entire experience is moving the camera around while looking for something to click on, and when you do find something, you'll just be zoomed closer to that object only to repeat the process all over again. Sure there's an occasional puzzle or brain teaser that may perplex you for a couple of minutes, but most of the time you'll just move from room to room watching videos and looking at pictures until finally quitting because of boredom-induced fits of rage. This is supposed to be fun?As a bonus for PC users, the developers were kind enough to include mouse support for PlayStation 2 owners who don't want to use their Dual Shocks. But with the Windows version of Myst III already listed as budget software at most retailers, there's no reason to exploit it. Should you want to use a mouse, you should just pick Exile up for your PC instead.As added bonuses, the original game trailer and a documentary showing how the programmers moved Myst III from PCs to consoles has been included in an extras section, and the manual itself has the official Prima Strategy Guide snuggled into the back of it. Ironically, watching these videos and flipping through the guide is actually more interactive than the game itself. Poor design if I've ever seen it.Graphics: The art design in Myst III is fantastic. The costumes, stylistic buildings, and alien structures are all handled in a way that rivals most science fiction films and is far and away the best looking of the entire series. Additionally, there's a host of varied colors and schemes that accentuate the landscapes quite well, and the full-motion video is razor sharp.Because you have free range of the camera though, it's not uncommon to find that the streaming FMV will lag behind your actions. So while you may see the idle animation of one character moving in a certain pattern just fine when you aren't moving, tilting the camera in any direction can suddenly cause a stutter so big it pauses everything on the screen. As the movie catches up with your actions, it'll work its way through the problem slower than I would have liked.Sound: The soundtrack here is great, and fits each area just perfectly. It's dynamic too, so the score will change tempo, speed, and tracks based on your actions or the mounting tension. Unfortunately, the game seems to be recorded in some kind of unknown version of Dolby Digital that drowns out the voices of the characters even with the music turned completely off. Which leaves me wondering how in the hell I'm supposed to know what to do next if I can't hear what everybody is saying. Out of all the sound techniques I tried, only the headphones I wore gave me a somewhat tangible performance from the speech set.I can't see myself recommending Myst III: Exile to anyone at any time. If you wanted to pick it up for Windows or Mac, chances are that you already have or will (especially now that it's dirt-cheap), and console adventure fans should find it almost worthless. Possible to own only by the remote chance that a cheapskate family member sees it in a bargain bin, it's in your best interest to steer clear of this one and wipe your memory of anything even remotely associated with it.", "date": "Oct 3, 2002"}
