Lead your nation to victory by stepping into the majestic and noble role ofcity manager! Baby-sit a populous of cry-babies who are more worried about flower beds in the town square than the hordes of Vikings and barbarians raping and pillaging their neighbors.  Experience the thrill of fighting against an uncooperative interface as you deftly map which cornfield you will plant next, and watch on pins and needles as your people scoff at your hopes of building a formidable army, despite their incessant complaints at the lack of security your leadership provides.  Welcome to the world of Medieval Lords, a game that fails to capture the mystique of life in the dark ages.  The game sets out to combine the war mongering challenges of real-time strategy with a Sim City set in medieval times, but what it achieves is a yard sale of disparate game mechanics that don't work well together and actually make combat the least fun part of the game.       In truth, it's more of a city sim than an RTS title, which isn't what you'd expect with the way the game is presented.  You will provide shelter, food, and spiritual nourishment for your ignorant plebeians, and in exchange, they will subject themselves to your taxes and enlist into your armies. The goal is to build your village as quickly as possible, fend off barbarian invasions, and take over neighboring settlements through military force in an effort to grow your numbers, improve your technology, and expand your bordersand keep everyone happy in the process. Your progress is measured by several economic indicators, which include food, water, health, leisure, serenity, and security.    Clicking on a house will allow you view the satisfaction levels of its inhabitants, and developers MonteCristo built in a sense of region by providing spheres of influence for each item placed in the game.    Just because the main city is secure and blissful doesn't mean your outlying villages will feel the same, and everything from bare necessities to the entertaining extras will need to be duplicated throughout the land to pacify everyone.  The game does a nice job of presenting this localization, providing several color-coded maps based on the resource you're trying to improve.  The presentation has a weather channel simplicity that makes finding the color-coded areas-in-need a simple task, and clicking on some structures will highlight the city streets to show their range of influence.  The real frustration comes in actually placing these buildings.     In an effort to incorporate a truly 3D environment that can be explored via a first person, fly-through view, the game uses a positioning algorithm to face your structures towards a city street.  If a street isn't available, it automatically builds one to the closest avenue.  This automation causes hours of headaches as you try to make use of the precious little real estate you're given to work with.  You will find yourself twitching the mouse in tiny increments, back and forth, trying to get the green light to build some menial structure, fighting with an AI that wants to auto-position it on a location where you can't build.  At times, I found myself clicking wildly just to drop a house or a garden.  Other times, I'd give up in disgust and resign myself to wasting more open spaces that would be better used for the larger and more unwieldy structures to save time and sanity.   Despite the headaches, placement of structures is the key component of the core gameplay.  Medieval Lords forces you to make strategic choices between the rewards and penalties that the key facilities provide.  Would you like a barn to store food and prepare for the next bad season?  This safety comes at the cost of peace and quiet, which will negatively affect the serenity of the surrounding homeowners.   You can counteract this drop in rating by transitioning one of the local food-producing spaces into a flower garden, but then you have to compensate for the loss of food supply somewhere else.  If the food supply is running low, you can transition the local vegetable garden into a pigpen that produces more food, but who wants to live near the smell of pigs? Your citizens will be well fed and fed up by the time it's all done, and you're going to hear them complain about it come tax time.      It is possible to do exceedingly well as city manager, a much more fitting title than 'Lord' is.  When you do, your villagers reward you by offering to pay more taxes. Taking them up on the offer and raising the tax level will negatively affect serenity, though, and you'll likely have a rebellion on your hands come next tax collection.  Rebellion is a passive resistance word the developers use for tax fraud.  They don't rise up with pitch forks or anything, they just don't pay you, and if you hope to lead your village dark-age-style, with an iron fist, you'll be disappointed at the lack of recourse your Medieval Lord has for this insubordination.    You can't deploy military or burn houses to achieve abject submission like the good ol' days.  Instead, you will be forced to acquiesce and solve whatever problem is troubling them.      A major disconnect that will disappoint fans of the city building genre is the simplicity of acquiring new technology.   Unlocking structures is as simple as building a single resource like a carpenter or mason, but although these technology branches are loosely interconnected, the challenge in attaining new levels is arbitrarily economic.   Even if you can afford to build and maintain a blacksmith, for example, the game may not let you based on the population numbers or size of your kingdom.  This takes any real skill out of strategically climbing the technology tree and forces a patience-based gameplay that will piss off those who like to experiment.  They take the strategy out of the game by forcing every player to take the same steps, in the same order, at the same point in the game.      This same problem is glaringly obvious in the real-time strategy aspects of the game where the military options are limited to a very few man-powered units that can be moved at will and siege based weapons that remain stationary once built.  Attacking your opponents isn't so much an exercise in military strategy as it is a struggle to make your villagers content enough with their pathetic lives that they will let you recruit more soldiers.  You don't have to pick the right assortment of soldiers to win a fight, either.  The units you choose seem to make almost no difference. You just have to recruit more of them than your opponent, and even this challenge can be minimized by building a ton of siege weapons and towers that have no man-power cost and can be destroyed once the battle is completed.        In Medieval Lords, combat is nothing more than a mechanism for acquiring and holding territory with a dungeon, the center of power.  If your main stronghold is overrun, you immediately lose the game.   Borders are drawn in colored outlines that surround each village's region of control.  In that region you can build new structures, station troops, and collect taxes.  Each map has several computer-controlled civilizations that range from the mindless brute of barbarians to the more advanced opponents of other European nations.  There are some roving invaders that might show up to demand homage, and you are given the option to pay up or fight them off.  But be warned.  They fight dirty!   The Vikings, for example, attack by sea and will pull up next to your stronghold, bypassing your carefully laid defenses, and attack your stronghold directly.  Paying them off, for any well-maintained economy, is a pittance compared to the headache of tying up the only scarce resourcetroops.     You initiate an attack by positioning your troops on the outskirts of an enemy's territory, but you can't sneak up on them or launch a surprise attack. No. No. No.  That wouldn't be very lordly.  Once your troops cross the border, the game counts down a 30-second grace period where you can build siege weapons, raise walls and construct towers to defend your army on the open field.  While you're getting set up, the computer-controlled enemy positions his armies and builds counter-intrusion forces to keep you at bay.   It's a positioning-the-pieces system that sucks the excitement out of the battle because once the clock hits zero, the computer takes over and steers the troops.  I guess your thrill is to watch a computer-controlled, generic animation charge into battle.  Each unit is represented by a fraction to show you the group's numbers.  When you take casualties, your only options are to disband the unit all together or deploy them at depleted strength.  You cannot combine your 20 remaining units with the 200 next to them, which is cumbersome because stationing each platoon takes as much space as a house.      Combat just isn't fun.  There isn't much variety in the armies to begin with, and the few that you're given are completely computer run.  They are about as smart as your average peanut, which is at least staying true to the heredity of the villagers.  They will attack any bad guys that wander nearby, but they won't chase them through your village.  Instead, they'll let them run right by and attack your houses.  You can order your soldiers to invade a city, but like lemmings, they charge straight to the enemy stronghold in the most roundabout method they can find, oblivious to all the armaments that shoot at them on the way. By the time they actually start working on your target, you'll be lucky if they're at half strength.   The icing on the cake was that, despite the patch that must be installed out of the box, the game is plagued with bugs that had me wishing I could raze my own city to ashes. In one of the first campaign scenarios, I spent two hours taking over the entire map only to encounter a bug the kept me from completing the level and, ultimately, forced me to start over.  In the next go around, I had worked for an hour and half to soothe my citizens and arm my forces when the interface completely crashed on the cusp of battle.  In more than a dozen hours of gameplay, I experienced a total of 10 bugs that required me to either reload or completely restart the campaign I was playing.    Medieval Lords isn't all bad, but it offers extras that I don't think most gamers will enjoy.  A great deal of attention was paid to a first person perspective that allows you to whoosh through your city's streets and see the world from the perspective of a citizen. It's painstakingly detailed.  If you fly past a tavern, you hear the ruckus of patrons inside.  You hear the cluck of poultry when you zero in on a hen house, and it looks impressively good.  This view will provide an interesting little niche for the sentimental types that care about their digital citizens, but outside of being an interesting aesthetic extra, this feature offers no value to the gameplay experience.     In fact, I'd say it hurts the gameplay because the support of this first-person view is clearly what causes the frustrations of building placement in the traditional top-down view that we are accustomed to. Understand that with every passing moment, your society should be growing and demanding more attention, less they commit tax evasion. You don't really have an opportunity to make use of this extra unless you're just tired of trying to convince the interface to lay a new farm.      The separation of real-time strategy and City-Builder is made abundantly clear with the complete lack of multiplayer, which in any RTS released today would be the equivalent of a signed death warrant. Because combat plays such an unimportant and unexciting role in the game, there isn't really a need to provide a feature that would allow you log on with your friends and spend hours building cornfields at each other.  There is a very interesting level builder included that enables you to map out your own scenarios, and this tool is very well designed and fun to play with.   It's unfortunate that the game itself isn't exciting enough to encourage people to make use of it.  The title of the game is Medieval Lords: Build, Defend, Expand.   This title is paraphrasing the gameplay, obviously, but they're leaving out some very important details that you really ought to consider.  Buildbut only where it will let you.  Defendagainst an enemy you can't attack.   And Expandbecause your absolutely idiotic villagers will bitch and moan for hours if you don't.  Despite some decent graphics, some interesting sound work, and the mystique of the middle ages to work with, the game feels unfinished and isn't much fun to play.", "date": "Nov 2, 2004"}
