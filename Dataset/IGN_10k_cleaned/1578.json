Each girl will star in her own Game Boy Color game, starting with the first of the series, Bad Mojo Jojo. But after the initial game, you might not be so excited for the release of the  future adventures... Features Multiple levels based in Townsville Battery save Secrets offered through Cartoon Network broadcasts Trade cards through the Link Cable between the other two Powerpuff Girls games Only for Game Boy Color  In Bad Mojo Jojo, the character to play is the Girl in Pink, Blossom. She may be small, but she's spry and powerful, sporting punches, kicks, and an optional icebeam that'll freeze foes in their places for a short time. She can also fly for a short period of time as long as her power meter has a notch or two in it  otherwise she'll plummet like a rock (safely) to the ground. The idea is to scoop up stolen items left behind by the bad guys  the more you collect, the higher the percentage you've completed the level when you find the end of the round. Some items are powerups, others are art cards that can be traded between systems outside of the adventure.  The in-game graphics are extremely simplistic, but the style fails to be as charming as the basic drawings of the television show. With so few pixels to work with on the system, and the designers insistence of having the girls the smallest sprite possible, the images come out blocky and speckled, lacking any possible detail. True, the cartoon doesn't really wow viewers with meticulous backgrounds and super-smooth animation, but the game designers could have incorporated a bit more of the show's basic style instead of creating something that looks like a homebrew development.  And this simplicity spills over into the gameplay, too. There's really not much to Powerpuff Girls: Bad Mojo Jojo it really boils down to a game where you fly around and collect icons thrown in different parts of the levels. Battling enemies is an element that does come into play, but it's very infrequent  you barely get the opportunity to beat up more than two enemies per level section.  In its defense, the game has absolutely massive level layouts, but they don't offer anything different than look, and you can seriously find yourself getting lost since they branch out all over the place. And there are some seriously annoying design issues  for example, land in water, and you lose a life. It wouldn't be that much of a problem, but when you lose a life, it's back to the beginning...with everything reset. Meaning, all the icons you've collected are re-scattered around the level.  The collision detection is a major problem as well. While one-on-one battles with enemies are rare, they are necessary in the game since you need to collect the icon each enemy holds  but these ~fights~ are sloppily handled since your sprite is so small. Your character's punches never reach out of the tile, so it's difficult to land a hit unless you're right on top of an enemy sprite  and it's usually a coinflip if the game registers you getting hit or the enemy taking the punch.  Powerpuff Girls: Bad Mojo Jojo isn't bad, but it could have been done much better than what was put out. I think the most depressing element is knowing there are two more games in the Powerpuff Girls series to come out, and it's highly likely that not much is going to change between the three games to keep the ~trading~ element intact. But we'll just have to wait and see  Paint the Townsville Green is due out this year, but Battle Him won't ship until 2001.", "date": "Dec 2, 2000"}
