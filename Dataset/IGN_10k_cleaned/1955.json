{"name": "WCW vs. The World", "name_review": "WCW vs. The World", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/10/08/wcw-vs-the-world", "text": "Remember when the WWF ruled the pro      wrestling circuit, and Hulk Hogan was a      good guy? When Hulk Hogan's Rock and      Wrestling cartoon show was the hottest      thing on Saturday mornings? Well,      apparently all that's changed. Since the      glory days of Capt. Lou Albano in Cyndi      Lauper videos and the Iron Sheik getting      busted for coke, wrestling has undergone a      few changes. Everybody has since left to      join the WCW (World Championship      Wrestling) and Hulk Hogan is a... bad guy!       Pro wrestling is making something of a      comeback now (or it's never really gone      away, depending on who you ask) and      WCW Vs The World is here to      let you bring the action home. Featuring 52      wrestlers from all over the world, WCW Vs      The World lets you play anyone from      'Hollywood' Hulk Hogan (his current 'bad      guy' name) to nice guy Eddie Guerrero to      Brandon Lee-in-The Crow-looking Sting.      For WCW fans, nothing else really comes      close as far as sheer amount of wrestlers.       The amount of options is pretty      impressive. You can compete in seven      different match types, including League and      Best Of 7, and you can choose to align      yourself with any of six wrestling      associations, including WCW, Empire      Wrestling Foundation, and Samurai      Wrestling Federation, or just claim      Independent.       The game itself is fully polygonal, and      looks clean, if a little bland. It's tough to actually make the connection between the picture of the wrestler you chose and the one you're playing with. The collision      detection, a sometime problem in past      wrestling games, is right on though, and poses no      problems when getting down to some dirty      grappling. Pull off a Frog Splash or Man of      a Thousand Moves, or any other such      exotic sounding finishing move.     The control is a little off in WCW Vs The World, but the sheer amount of options should keep most wrestling fans happy. Non-wrestling fans should probably rent it first.
