The plot is simple. Ride a bike around a real-world type city that features pedestrians, traffic and sundry other hazards, pick up packages from curbside citizens and take them to somebody else waiting in another part of the city. All within a strict time limit. Helping out is a big arrow that points you in the right direction, and the rest is down to your skill in avoiding hazards so you make the drop-off before the timer expires. Deliver all packages in that level and you move onto the next, more hazardous level. Simple? It certainly is. Fun? It certainly ain't.  The game design is poor, to be honest. The way the difficulty increases is by more things appearing on the streets, and pick up and delivery points getting further and further apart. There's no real variety -- you just do the same thing over and over in very similar-looking locations.   None of this is helped by the fact that the gameplay simply isn't fast or exciting. The controls aren't tight enough, so it's difficult to precisely steer, which is really necessary in the tight and narrow hazard-filled streets. But most of the time it doesn't really matter too much. When you crash into something and don't spill, you can just spin on the spot until you're pointing in the right direction -- and as you can imagine, a guy on a motionless bike slowly spinning around looks duh-umb.   The graphics suffer from poor clipping, slowdown and a generally choppy frame rate. Most of the landscape and buildings feature pixelated textures, and stuff like vehicles and pedestrians aren't anything to write home about, so I'll save myself the price of a stamp.   All this added to the generally poor presentation, inane repeating sampled phrases and dreadful punk soundtrack results in a game that very quickly loses what little appeal it has. Yes, it's fun being able to mow down pedestrians and small children -- indeed, there's a bonus point in its score for that! -- but it's just not enough. It gets old fast and you're left with a very dull and unexciting game that, somewhat ironically considering the subject matter, totally fails to deliver the goods.
