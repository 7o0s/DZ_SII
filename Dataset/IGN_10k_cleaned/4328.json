In fact, not since the PSOne's side-scrolling Metal Slug X in 2001 have we seen an SNK title domestically available for consoles. Sadly, we'd have to pull out our Sega Dreamcasts and reverse time even further backwards just to remember the last opportunity to enjoy the company's flagship series The King of Fighters. But even that iteration (King of Fighters '99: Evolution) is considered one of the weakest in the franchise's history, and other than that we haven't had much to speak of since.   Fueled by parent company SNK Playmore's strong financial backing and resurgence in consumer popularity for retro re-releases, however, the developer best known for its fighting and shooting games is poised to make an impression on English-speaking audiences once again. Firing its first shot into the marketplace with its two-disc compilation King of Fighters 2000/2001, SNK Playmore has shown that its ready to get back into the swing of things starting now; even if its first attempt at doing so isn't exactly on cutting edge of software.   King of Fighters 2000  Since it's based on the exact same engine that's powered the franchise since 1994, King of Fighters 2000 will feel enormously familiar. Though it's nowhere near as pretty as the more modern Guilty Gear X2 or even Capcom vs. SNK 2, its familiar art style and lack of load time goes a long way for those of us who had to chug through the Neo-Geo CD import version. In terms of playability, however, everything is practically the same. Utilizing the same four-button setup as the previous installments, KOF 2000's basic fighting system is actually a lot deeper than casual observers give it credit for; with familiar staples like super combinations, chain attacks, Strikers, and emergency escapes combining together for one mean collection of mechanics.    If you're unfamiliar with Strikers and what they do, they're evocative of the Assist command from the Marvel vs. Capcom series. Used as secondary attacks, each striker can be activated with the R1 button and unleash specialized feats that can that make opponents dizzy or hurt. They be used for other functions as well (like healing or combo bar replenishment) and can even be refilled by taunting your opponent with the L1 trigger. Luckily, these Strikers are a whole lot more important in 2000 than they were in 1999) -- where the Striker function seemed to be nothing more than a novelty -- and are pretty important elements to master for beating the higher difficulty settings.   King of Fighters 2000 also implements the familiar armor and counter modes (L2 and R2) which can double the powers of your defense and reverse combos regardless of what point they're attacking. Additionally, KOF 2000 is a whole lot faster than its 1999 counterpart with quicker matches, more intuitive timing, and better balancing. Strangely, however, the localized PS2 port lacks any of the blood or breast bouncing that the Japanese edition has and Whip has had her gun maneuver removed completely. Expect SNK purists to be put off quite a bit by that one.   In terms of characters, KOF 2000 introduces five new selectable fighters (Lin, Ramon, Hinako, Kula, and Zero) in conjunction with 30 other familiar faces (Kyo, Mai, Benimaru, etc) for the veterans. As we stated in our import review of KOF 2000 and our preview of 2000/2001 earlier this year, however, Lin is definitely the most useful of the new characters (and Kula a close second); with Whip, K', Kyo, and Iori providing plenty of old-school enjoyment.    Sadly, King of Fighters 2000 has rather clunky controls compared to classics like KOF '98 or KOF '97 with moves that are more difficult to pull off on a directional pad than they should be. Granted, this has always been the case with the series as a whole, but if ever there was a fighting game that demands an arcade stick it would be this one. Other small complaints: like the weaker storyline (will anything ever live up to the Orochi saga?), re-organized teams (King on the Art of Fighting squad? No.), and demanding Battle Point formula holds it back from achieving true fighting greatness.   But at least compilation owners are being rewarded with exclusive Strikers like Mr. Big, Krauser and Zero. Other PS2-exclusives like the Party Mode (a modified survival feature that allows players to unlock special bonuses) and Memory Mode () allow you to get a little extra oomph out of your purchase. You can even choose between the original and arranged soundtrack when playing -- an option not available in the original Neo-Geo version.   King of Fighters 2001  King of Fighters 2001 is a huge step forward in terms of gameplay and presentation when compared to that of 2000. Despite the fact that the fighting system itself is pretty similar, there are still a number of changes that have been made. The counter and armor modes, for instance, have been completely removed and Striker bombs have been eliminated in favor of power stocks. Also cool is that you're no longer limited to participating in three-on-three battles, as now you can mix and match them any way you like. Player One, for example, can select one fighter and three strikers while Player Two can choose up to four fighters and no strikers. Any combination of this four-person team can be assembled or manipulated and those selections affect the defensive ability of your fighter, length of their power gauge, and how many Power Stocks they receives.    Selecting the proper lineup of characters is an important decision -- as the more fighters you're using, the smaller your Power Stock will be. The smaller the Power Stock, the fewer times you can use a striker and the less you'll be able to perform guard cancels and other special moves. On the flipside, selecting a bunch of strikers with fewer fighters increases the power of your characters considerably; and not only will your defensive abilities and strikers be more effective, but you'll have an increased chance to perform special maneuvers too. It's a fresh approach to an old series and one we appreciated quite considerably.   Another big addition for KOF 2001 what's known as the ~Wire Damage~ attack; which is separated into two different types: Critical Wire for offense and Counter Wire for defense. Pre-loaded into certain types of hits, the Wire Damage attack works like an explosion: knocking your opponent to the other side of the screen and bouncing them back towards the user: which then opens them up for further attacks and combos. When used in conjunction with the new Super Attack move (which replaces the armor and cancel modes) the already faster King of Fighters 2001 turns out to be a quicker and enjoyable game than its predecessor.   The visuals have been improved upon as well and offer players newly designed 3D polygonal versions of the stages that powered the arcade ROM. Should traditional SNK lovers prefer to play in the original sprite-based backgrounds, however, they can do that too; once they unlock them that is. Unfortunately, character sprites and super move animations are the same as they were in KOF 2000; with a few extra win poses and a couple of new frames of animation for astute observers. Bu the censors have found their way into this version of KOF as well, though with no blood or bounce anywhere to be found (with the exception of Heidern's ~Final Bringer~ finisher).    In terms of its sound, 2001 doesn't offer the arranged soundtrack that 2000 does (weird), nor is its soundtrack quite as strong. To its credit, though, developer Eolith has re-voiced certain characters like K' and added a few bonus effects that the Neo version didn't have, not to mention the fact that the 2001 intro is worlds better than the previous incarnation's. We just wish there was an excuse to listen to Mad Fantasy or Rhythmic Hallucination again -- which we haven't been able to do since '98.For the $40 price tag, King of Fighters 2000/2001 is still a pretty good bargain for aficionados and fans of the franchise. Though neither one of them are strong as the '94 through '97 installments, they're still very good when compared to more recent combat titles like Budokai 2 and Bloody Roar 4. Even if their graphical qualities and production values do leave a lot to be desired.Ironically, KOF 2000/2001's biggest sales enemy are actually the KOF fans themselves. With an underground MVS movement that's been getting stronger every year, the audience that would normally pick this one up probably already owns the uncensored MVS version anyway; not having to worry about missing moves or a lack of blood and sexuality. Hopefully, though, there are enough hardcore fans left that will run out and buy a copy for the PS2 anyway -- to do nothing else but give SNK enough of an incentive to release its other planned productions, Metal Slug 5 and Samurai Shodown Zero here in the states. It'll be interesting to see what happens.", "date": "Dec 11, 2003"}
