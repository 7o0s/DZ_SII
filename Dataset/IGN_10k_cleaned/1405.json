While the game never really made a huge splash in the US, it was at least relatively popular in the Japanese arcade circuit, and that appearance on the short-lived SNK handheld was the first real mainstream glimpse of the game in this country. But courtesy of semi-newcomer Classified Games, Magical Drop is making a much larger impact here as a Game Boy Color title, and while it doesn't quite match up with SNK's offering last year, it's an above-average, unique take on the Tetris/Bust-a-Move puzzle genre. Features Adjustable difficulty levels Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Color  The game looks, on the surface, very much like Bust-a-Move from Taito. And in some cases, it's a lot like that game  but Magical Drop has one gameplay element that's unique to the whole ~match-the-colored-icons~ design  you only work with what's in the pile. In a better description, you work your character at the bottom of the screen, grabbing the colored spheres from the pile that moves in from the top. You can only hold one color at a time, but you can hold as many of those colored spheres as you can at one time. What you need to do is throw the spheres back up into the pile so that it forms a vertical row of at least three of the same colors  this activates the stack and makes any of those colors touching the three to disappear. As they disappear, you can work more combos into the mix by grabbing more balls and tossing them back up to activate more connections. And the pile will also settle into place to create its own set of combos to delete more of the stack. If the stack pushes below the bottom line, the game is over.  It's an OK single-player game, but there's not much to it as the only option you have is to change the difficulty between easy, medium, and hard. It's just a marathon where you continuously delete the pile until you can no longer keep up with the stack's automatic speed. There's no option to challenge a computer opponent, or an option for weird puzzles to give the title a little variety. As a one-player game, the Game Boy Color Magical Drop seriously lacks, even though the game design is relatively fun to play.  Where the game shines, though, is in the link cable mode. If you get a friend in on the action, the battling can get seriously fierce. When Vs. mode is enabled (you'll need two systems, two copies of the game, and a link cable), the game screen shrinks down to show both players' playing fields. And the task is to just be quicker than the game's animation by forming combos faster than your opponent. The game engine's framerate chops up slightly compared to the single player modes, but it's a lot more maniacal and quicker than the solitaire mode because you're up against your opponent who's throwing more spheres onto your screen. It's crazy addictive in this two-player mode, which makes it disappointing that the developers didn't include a computer AI for the folks who don't have access to this mode.  The game doesn't look nearly as good as it does on the NeoGeo Pocket Color, but you can chalk that one up to the Game Boy Color's less-capable hardware. The sprites and spheres are smaller than the NeoGeo version, and the action just isn't quite as quick or smooth. But the developers did a decent enough conversion to please the tiny percentage of people who've actually played this game in other forms on other systems.  Tetris it isn't, but Magical Drop has its own merits as a puzzle game that makes it fun to play. The Game Boy Color conversion is as barebones as you can get for a puzzle game on the system -- there could have been more attention paid in the form of options for the single player modes, because there's just not much to the package.", "date": "Oct 26, 2000"}
