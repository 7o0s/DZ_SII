Resident Evil comes to mind, with Cyberia trailing back there somewhere. Silverload should also be ranked up there. Great graphics and a compelling horror story set in the Old West make for a truly remarkable game.  The graphics, a mix of detailed, hand-drawn backgrounds and painted-over digitized actors, give the whole game an eerie quality bested only by Capcom's Resident Evil. The character designs are pretty stereotypically Western, but work nonetheless. Still, the characters are pretty creepy, and help contribute to the overall scariness of the game. And even though, as is common with linear, graphic adventures, you're forced to repeat certain sequences until you've gotten them right, the title never really loses that eerie quality.  The game's only real flaw is the interface, which is icon and ~hot-spot~ based. While this type of interface works fine on a PC (in fact was designed for one), using the PSX controller sometimes causes some problems. Unfortunately, the PlayStation mouse, even though compatible, doesn't seem to help. Barring the interface, Silverload is a welcome addition to the PlayStation's relatively small library of graphic adventures.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
