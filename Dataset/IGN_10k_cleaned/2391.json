Without it we'd never have games like Robotron, Smash TV, and the heavenly Ape Escape, titles that finally gave your right thumb something to live for. Now that dual analog's standard on every next-generation system, we can finally get to the business we've been waiting for -- shooting things with one hand while running around like a chicken with the other. Nightcaster is Microsoft's contribution to the dual analog legacy, a fantasy action romp that has you aiming with the right stick while moving with the. Listen, it's sorcery -- so just chalk it up to Lucifer's power that a young mage can fire a volley of ice crystals at bugs behind him while running forward.  Nightcaster's more than just an example of next-generation control schemes, though. It's primarily Microsoft's slot-filler for the action/fantasy genre, like Gauntlet Legends, or Diablo. You've got monster spawners to demolish, hordes of monsters to slay, and a simplified storyline and quest to keep things focused on that carnage.  Gameplay As young Arran, it's your job to travel through a variety of levels in an effort to return the world to light. In layman's terms, it's about using your four different flavors of magic (fire, water, light and dark) to kill everything in your way. While there are some branching paths to be found, everything's pretty logically laid out, and linear enough that you'll rarely get lost.  That's all part of the game, however -- this isn't a full on D&D exploration RPG, this is more about battling monsters and getting to the other side, whatever that side may be. The gimmick with Nightcaster, though, is that you've got four different colors of enemies to fight with your four different colors of magic, usually mixed together like a package of Chiclets. At first play it sounds like a great idea, because your spells are more than just different brands of the same product -- each spell has a different way to attack, but they also are built to pummel one specific monster. Hit an ice variety of wolf with an ice spell, and you'll do little more than stun them for a second. Hit them with fire, and watch the fun begin.   The next step to making the game more complex is creating enemies that take much longer to kill than in most games of this type. Every monster takes at least two or three hits to kill, and some take six to seven, making battles much slower paced than you'd expect. Unfortunately, match the slower battling with the color mixing, and you're basically playing the game in reverse, running away, firing off a few shots of each color, returning for a few meek attacks, then running away again. If you're going to get deep into the world of Nightcaster you'll quickly learn that defensive tactics are the only way to survive -- especially when you start getting attacked by characters that'll knock out your health in a matter of seconds.    It's not the balance of the game is off, because it feels like a choice of the developers to match up the enemy difficulty and spell matching this way. It's that the balance just doesn't work to make the game fun... when you've got to spend minutes on every little set of tiny bugs that race after you, methodically taking them out by colors while running away to keep you precious health intact (did I mention that you've got no inventory for health?), it quickly stops being fun and starts feeling like you're mowing the digital lawn. As you progress through the game and gain some of the second and third levels of the spells, you'll be disappointed to find that they still do little to kill monsters in one hit. It's a payoff in order to make the game longer, but in the end it just doesn't work. It makes battles, the entire core of the games, seem more tedious and anal then they should be, instead of allowing you to pick your favorite spells and sludge into battle with some quick reflexes, which is what makes games of this type so much fun.   There are side quests in the game that will give you special bonuses to your mana reserve, and even reveal new spells, but they're a matter of heading down a small path rather that exploring en entirely new region. And like the gameplay, many times they feel more like a way to drag out the total playing time of the game rather than deliver some extra fun for those who want the most out of the game. Most of the time, it's a matter of going down a side path, hearing a request for a missing person/piece of information, stumbling onto the character on the main route, then trudging all the way back across a now-empty map to deliver the goods. After a few times of this, you'll begin to question if all of this is really worth a tiny bonus... though believe me, you'll keep doing it for one of the useful runes in the game.  Graphics You'll enjoy some of the nice touches of the game, the discreet bump mapping on ground textures and on characters, as well as the beautiful lighting and particle effects of the over the top spells. The 3D atmosphere of the game, where you'll find yourself exploring forests up to mountain trails, down into valleys, and up into places like a decaying temple are fantastic, especially since you can see it all ahead of you with the huge draw distance. In terms of detail the game keeps things fairly simple overall, with larger structures made up of flatter blocks, and the time taken with textures rather than the intricacies of the environment... but overall you'll find yourself with a solid looking game with some nice Xbox ready pluses.   Sound The music's moody and fantastical without ever becoming annoying, and sound effects are just as solid. There's not a lot of talking , though the voice acting in the game varies from s'alright to enjoyable, depending on the importance of the characters. The game delivers good ear candy where it counts, though, in the sounds of battle and the spells. While you won't be humming songs, or remembering specific sounds of battle after you turn off the game, you won't be left with a bad taste in your mouth, er, bad wax in your ears, either. Nightcaster's an arcade game with aspirations of being Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance. Unfortunately, tactics like making thicker skinned enemies , adding the color immunities and side quests are only good if they're fully implemented, completely focused ideas. They're not, so the end result is a game that could have been a Gauntlet Legends or Diablo type action title, but is more methodical and repetitive than it has any right to be. Nightcaster's a fun title, but you'll find yourself wanting more, or in some cases, less.", "date": "Dec 15, 2001"}
