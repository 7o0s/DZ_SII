Since the idea behind the game is to advance beyond the capabilities of your opponents, skillful players can find themselves outdistancing opponents as early as the Middle Ages. This can make the combat later in the game a bit lop-sided as tanks roll over pikemen or musketeers. And while it's fun to steamroll over your opponents, it can bring to the game a sort of tedious inevitability that's not as compelling as a fight between equals.  Enter Civilization III: Conquests. This latest expansion offers nine new scenarios and a laundry list of changes to the core game. The scenarios here offer a chance to run through some of the watershed conflicts in history on a scale that's at once both broad and wonderfully particular. The abstraction and flow of the core game is preserved here but the starting positions of each civ are usually structured to thrust players into conflict using a particular group of technologies. In other words, there are big battles and clashes set during various periods of history.  Many of the scenarios offer locked alliances and enmities. In other words, there are some rival civs that won't ever make peace with you. To counteract this, there are sometimes civs that won't ever fail to take your side in a conflict. Each new scenario comes with it's own Wonders, technologies and units. While most of these merely change the name of existing improvements, there are a few surprises scattered here and there. The objectives are often limited in these scenarios focusing on controlling a certain amount of the land or population on a map. Some scenarios are won by earning points for returning treasure units to certain cities on the map.  Since the game isn't on shelves yet, we've not yet had a chance to try out all the multiplayer options. Given the shorter and more focused nature of the scenarios, they're likely to draw players who don't have the patience or leisure to sit down for a full game.  Let's take a look at each of the scenarios in turn. First up (chronologically speaking) is the Mesopotamian campaign. Featuring seven competing civs at the dawn of civilization, you're given very little at the start and have to build up an empire from scratch. You're trying to build each of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world. The game ends and a winner is declared once the last Wonder is completed. To be honest, I'm never that hot on producing most of the ancient Wonders so I wasn't terribly prepared for the level of competition here. I usually start ramping up the Wonder production at the start of the Middle Ages. The way the scores are broken down, you do get a fair number of points from regular expansion but the game still seems to go to the side with the most Wonders.  Rise of Rome is much more up my alley. I've always been a big fan of swordsmen and I really enjoy using the Legions early on in the game. This scenario is polarized between the Carthaginians and Romans but there are some decent opportunities for the Persians or Macedonians to find their own paths to supremacy -- more so if the Romans and Carthaginians hit a stalemate. As with most of the scenarios in the pack (and the original game, as well) everyone likes to gang up on the big guy. When growing you'll need to make sure you offer a few gifts to neighboring nations that might pose a threat. Since a large road makes a circuit of the whole map, early expansion is easy. For the Roman player, whose Legions can also build roads, you can develop a fairly convenient road network relatively early in the game without sacrificing your military development.   The Fall of Rome campaign is a bit different. There are now two halves of the Roman Empire and a large number of barbarians ready to tear through either of them. As a barbarian leader (you can't play as either Roman civ), you'll have to attack Roman cities. Once eight cities from any civ are destroyed, that civ is removed from the game. There was a variant of this kind of play in the previous expansion and it makes for some thrilling moments as one side goes on an all-out attack against a well-defended enemy. Since the cost for the Romans to reach the Barbarian side of the tech tree is outrageously high, each side in this struggle will have to adopt a unique approach to their problems.      Following on the Fall of Rome, players can try their hand at the Middle Ages campaign. This one sees three big groups of players, each working towards different objectives. A fourth group of AI-only civs act as a spoiler to the rest of the action. On one hand you have Christians, who are trying to get their Holy Relic unit to Jerusalem. The Viking and Muslim civs are intent on plundering Europe and seeking out the three kings each civ must protect.   The initial description of the Mesoamerican campaign seemed kind of boring. Three civs competing for cultural victory on a very small bit of habitable land doesn't sound like much fun to me (despite the fact that I sometimes dig going for the cultural victory in the core game) but when you add in the ability of the civs to sacrifice captured enemy workers for extra culture points, the whole dynamic of the game is opened up. Suddenly it's about capturing enemies and enslaving them. It's not unusual to see ownership of a worker change back and forth a couple of times before they finally make it to the city's altar.  European civs will find the Age of Discovery campaign fairly restrictive at the start. They're crammed into a small slice of Europe, sometimes with only one square between rival cities. The entire west coast of Africa and the Americas are available for colonization, but the existing civs are sure to resist any attempt to push them aside. The American civs have a chance to win a cultural victory using the same techniques as in the Mesoamerican scenario. The Europeans will have to colonize resources in the New World to produce treasure units which can be taken back across the Atlantic to score victory points. It's a great dynamic because the European powers are competing with each other but are also united in their desire to keep the Mesoamericans from achieving their cultural victory.  The feudal Japan scenario is one of the most involved in the expansion. Featuring 18 rival warlords competing across a huge map of Japan, it can take a few days to run through one of these. It's really rich in Japanese flavor, starting you with samurai and ninjas and letting you weather the storm of the arrival of gunpowder. Your king unit in this scenario can become an amazingly unbeatable fighter but, as in all regicide games, you run the risk of losing it all if he falls in battle. Though the game is geared to be a real slugfest, the smart player can find sneaky ways to win early. I've won a game by building the equivalent of the UN and then giving generously to all the other civs when it came time to elect the new Shogun.  Napoleon's campaign is also a real bear, not so much because of the number of players involved or the size of the map but rather because of the incredible hostility that all other nations (except Denmark) seem to feel towards France. Starting in 1800, you'll find things quickly turn against you as the French player. Even massive gifts to your allies won't stop them from ganging up on you. Since you're basically located between six or seven enemies, holding back the invading alliance of Britiain, Naples and the rest can be a supreme challenge. It seems less challenging when you take on the command of one of the other nations but, as this is a Napoleonic Wars campaign, I really have to stick with Napoleon.   Finally there's the WWII campaign set in the Pacific. Geared as a massive naval battle with attendant island hopping, the real conflict here is between the Japanese and the Americans. Still the British and Chinese have plenty of opportunity to help sway things toward the Allied side. Although the American and Japanese experience is more engaging, you can find yourself influencing that conflict by taking part as a minor player. With so many units and such a large map, it seems like it takes forever to reach the 50th and final turn. Still, I loved every minute of it. I did find it confusing at first that the individual ships were all named separately but after a while you get used to it.      Beyond the basic scenarios, the team has added plenty of new features and adjustments to the core game. Seven new civs have been added including the long-awaited Dutch. Players can now take charge of two early civs with the Sumerians and Hittites or try their hand at the two new Mesoamerican civs, the Incans and Mayans.  Two new civ traits have been added -- seafaring and agricultural. Seafaring civs have less chance of sinking at sea and add commerce bonuses to cities on the coast. The advantage seafaring civs have in starting on the coast is probably one of the most fundamental benefits of this trait. As far as agriculture goes, it's really great when combined with the short-lived advantages of the expansionist trait. The food bonus for agricultural civs makes them great for expanding early in the game. To better incorporate these new traits into the overall game, traits have been reassigned to existing civs. The English and Carthaginians are seafaring people now, while the Celts and Iroquois are agricultural.  Conquests features the welcome return of Feudalism as a government type. Serving civs with this middle ground between Monarchy and Communism helps, this government helps warlike civs stay competitive. It's most useful for civs that have expanded too quickly and now find themselves crushed by the weight of dozens of towns. Fascism is an entirely new government offers some significant military benefits but comes with substantial reductions in population when selected.  In addition to the new governments, the team has adjusted two of the existing governments to make them more balanced. Communist leaders can now create a Secret Police headquarters that acts as a second Forbidden Palace. Republican governments will find it much harder to wage war now as their unit support cost has been doubled. That's right, doubled. While it sounds harsh, it definitely helps emphasize the distinction between the warmongering governments and the more peaceful ones.  In addition to the unique units for the new civs, there are nine new units available to all players. An early naval unit that doesn't require resources can help you scout out your coastline, while a late era anti-tank unit (also not requiring any resources) can shift the weight towards the defensive player. There are some small tweaks to most of the existing units in the game as well. For the most part, these changes are fairly minor but the new defensive first strike capability of musketeers and the enslavement potential of some of the naval units definitely change the pace of the game. Bombers can now destroy ships through bombardment and submarines can choose which unit to attack when going up against a stack of enemies. Both these additions make these units much more effective than they were previously  Five new Wonders have been added, primarily to the early portion of the game. Going by what I said earlier about not focusing on early Wonders, this is less compelling for me but still a great addition for players who focus on such things. Some, like the Statue of Zeus or the Knights Templar will automatically generate military units over time. Others, like the Temple of Artemis or the Mausoleum of Mausollos (how's that for redundant?) merely serve to make your people happy. At least, that's all they'd do if it weren't for the new ability of Wonders to serve as tourist attractions. Given sufficient time certain Wonders may begin bringing in added commerce to reflect the number of people traveling to the city to see the Wonder.  Beyond that, the team has addressed a number of smaller issues that have a profound effect on the pace of the game. You can clear forests now in half the time it used to take, for instance. On the other hand, the maximum research time has been increased from 40 to 50 years. Players who rely on that 40-turn ceiling will find themselves falling farther and farther behind now. (Although, if it's taking you 40 turns, there are plenty of other problems to be dealt with.) Hurrying production is now 50% more expensive than it was before, making those rush jobs much more costly.   There are other changes too numerous to list -- from increased chances for cultural conversion if your capital is captured to revealing the map once Satellites is researched. There are also random map sizes, continental rally points, optional unit cycling in multiplayer; the list goes on and on. In all the cumulative effect of the seemingly small changes make Civ a slightly more balanced and slightly more complex game. I really like the direction this expansion has taken. It seems when you start with a game that lets you play through the almost all of human history (the civilized, non-cave dwelling bits at least) that there's really nowhere to go. Adding multiplayer was fairly obvious of course, but beyond that, it really seemed as if the game couldn't grow any more, at least not without complicating things overly.Which is why I think Conquests is a great idea. Rather than trying to remake the entire game, the team has instead presented us with several ~slices~ of history (the slice being the basic unit of history) that use the same concepts as the main game but offer plenty of new toys, techs and trials. The fact that each scenario represents an interesting historical conflict is an added bonus. Since there's never any guarantee that you'll have enemies of sufficient power and technology to offer the kinds of head-to-head challenges that makes human history so fascinating, these pre-scripted conflicts are a nice option.To be sure, they lack much of the dynamic unpredictability of the epic game and have fewer surprises in store for players (once they get used to the new units and technologies of course). Still, the new victory conditions do offer a compelling alternative to regular play and require you to rethink some of your timeworn strategies. Where victory is a matter of safely transporting treasure units back to your capital, for instance, you'll have to shift the priorities you use when playing the standard game.The standard 6000 year version is still my game of choice as far as Civilization is concerned but that's no reason not to recommend Conquests. Even if you don't care at all about the smaller scenarios, there's plenty to be enjoyed just in the additions to the standard game.", "date": "Nov 1, 2003"}
