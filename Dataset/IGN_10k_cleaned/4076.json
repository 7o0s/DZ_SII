In no way, shape, or form should games be designed solely to pimp another license. If a film warrants a game -- such as ~Matrix~ or ~Tron~ -- then we're all for it. But releasing a so-called game just to juice the cash cow is shameless and shameful.Zany Race is technically a racing game. You have a bird's eye view of a city and you must drive from block to block, avoiding obstacles like ACME bombs and oil slicks, looking for diamonds. Okay, for a cellphone game, we'll roll with this so far -- story and plot serve little purpose in a cell title.The character select screen splashes nice, colorful images of the Looney tune characters in front of you. Hey, who doesn't want to play as daffy? So, we'll pick him and get into the game. Well, guess what? That's the last you see of Daffy. Instead, Daffy is represented by an itty-bitty blue car. No bill, no black feathers, no flag on his tail signaling ~screwball.~ No nothing. Just further proof this was a crap game with the Looney Tunes license haphazardly slapped on it.The control is awful. You simply press the stick or touch pad in the direction you want the little car to go. Sometimes it turns that way, other times -- no. It swipes the side of a building and sits there. Lame. Nevermind that the visuals are so plain and cookie-cutter, completely devoid of the charm and verve of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. As a fan of Looney Tunes and an evangelist for cellphone gaming, I can't believe this horrid, horrid game. It not only stands for everything that's wrong with corporate syngery, but the lackluster play value is why people get turned off the cell gaming. Three or four bucks for a crap game is still too much. Customers deserve much better than this. Sprint and WB deserve a pecking from Foghorn Leghorn.", "date": "Oct 29, 2003"}
