After a full year, the Dreamcast has but one quality role playing game, in the form of Evolution.  I was hoping that Climax Landers would fill the slot, but it had some problems, as detailed in our review of it from a few weeks back.  More recently, though, I was looking to Langrisser as the saving grace - this is a series with history, afterall.  It turns out that the first Dreamcast version of Langrisser tries hard to be a modern day update of sorts to Dragon Force, but it ends up not working, primarily due to a flawed battle system.  You start off the game by selecting from six world warriors of varying backgrounds, similar in style to Dragon Force.  In the opening moments of the game, as shown through a series of still frame pics and realtime 3D animated scenes, each of these guys will somehow manage to take to the throne of their individual country, and you'll have to lead them across the world to conquer all the nations run by the other characters.  Each character has a different storyline, which progresses at various points throughout your journey towards conquest.  The actual game's progression is, once again, similar in style to the acclaimed Sega/Working Designs masterpiece.  You start off by moving your troops between castles across the large Langrisser world via an overworld map.  Of course, other factions are moving their troops along the map in realtime, making for a good deal of onscreen activity.  Move your troops into an empty castle, or a castle without a leader, and you'll take over the castle.  If, however, you attempt to move into a castle that has an enemy leader, your troops will enter into ground battle with the occupants of the castle.  Ground based battle sees your party of up to four combatants battling it out with up to four enemies.  You're given full control during the battle over your commander, with your physically moving the character around the screen, and pushing buttons to strike the enemy troops.  Your control over the other three members of your party is limited to setting a formation, ordering all the characters to either attack or defend, and ordering a specific character to cast magic.  The question I have is, with only three troops at your disposal, why aren't you given more control over them?  I want to be able to tell each troop to attack another individual troop.  Dragon Force didn't allow for this, but that was explicable, as in that example, you were in command of at most 100 troops.  It's somewhat funny, though, that Dragon Force gave you more control of its 100 troops than you have over the three troops in Langrisser.  Another problem involves the action element itself.  It's poorly done, making moving your commander into position and hitting the guy you want to hit very difficult.  I actually found that much of the time, when trying to hit a specific guy, I'd either attack a different guy, or I'd lunge in the wrong direction entirely, striking the air.  Beyond that, the action element ends up leading to some humorous situations, as you're easily able to make your commander win against a single, more powerful opponent using the following tactic: run around the opponent, then strike him, then run around the opponent more, then strike him, over and over again until the enemy is defeated.  The map is, for the most part, well done, and there's a lot of strategy to be had during this phase.  There are a couple of inexcusable problems, though.  First off, if a party should attack a castle and loose, the party will instantly be whisked back to its castle of origin.  I'm of the impression that the troops should have to physically move back, and you should see this reflected in their slowly making their way back on the map.  The other problem involves the following scenario.  Let's say you have thirty troops in your castle, and you fall under attack by a group of four enemies.  You're given the option of choosing your own party of four to battle the enemies, and if you loose, the game inexplicably surrenders your entire castle to the enemies.  All thirty of the castle's inhabitants are whisked away to your nearest castle, and if you don't have another castle, the game ends.  What's really funny is that if the characters happen to be in a castle that's isolated from all other castles under your command, meaning there are roads adjoining them to another castle under your command, they'll still manage to be whisked away to the nearest castle if they loose a battle, despite the fact that they had possible means of movement.  The developers clearly put little thought into this sytem. Langrisser Millenium is, first and foremost, a strategy game, and because it has these major inconsistencies in the strategy element, as well as the limited troop control, I don't see how I can possibly recommend it.  There are a lot of good features, though.  The character designs (which originate from a new-comer to the series), are first class, as is the voice acting throughout the story and battle scenes.  The game also takes a lot of though, and is very difficult (I had to restart three times, as I kept on getting overpowered), so gamers looking for a challenge may want to look into this.  Also good, I suppose, is the inclusion of full 3D graphics for all aspects of gameplay and story telling, except for a few animated still frames.  Actually, this area is somewhat of a mixed bag, as the overhead map looks good, as do the story sections, but the battles are often ugly.  In fact, the 3D nature of the overhead map gets in the way somewhat, as it's hard to keep track of the goings on around the world - I'd have preferred a more primitive, but much more informative overhead 2D map.  I was hoping that the Langrisser series would make an appearance in America with this game, but my opinion has changed now that I've actually played the title.  Let's hope that this is the Dreamcast's equivalent of Langrisser III, and the following Dreamcast Langrisser games will be a lot better.  -- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 10, 1999"}
