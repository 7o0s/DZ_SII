The first title in the Worms series on PSP, titled Worms: Open Warfare, has landed. Developed by Team17, Open Warfare sticks with the basic premise of warring worms established in the original game. It keeps the oddball humor, voices and 2D presentation of the original, but it throws in a few exclusive modes to spice things up a bit.  The additions may not be enough to warrant a look from some players, especially those burned out on the series. But for those can't get enough, Open Warfare packs enough content to make lifelong Worms aficionados take notice. In case you haven't played a single entry in this long-running series, though, it offers a good deal of solid gameplay.   It follows the same formula as the 2D classic Scorched Earth, in which two opposing tanks took turns bombing the hell out of each other. What made it interesting was the way you attacked the enemy tank - by forming lethal arcs of fire by changing the latitude of the cannon barrel.    It was simple turn-based strategy, and it's the same today. Only instead of tanks, you command armies of cartoon-like worms. And instead of tank shells, you fire everything from bazookas and sheep, to banana bombs and homing missiles. Success hinges on the mastery of weapon, since each behaves radically different. The banana bomb, for instance, explodes on impact and scatters mini-bombs to the surrounding area. It's great when used against a group of enemies, but suicidal when used in close proximity to your own troops.  You can also use a variety of gadgets to help you skirt around the 2D maps, such as teleport units, jet packs and ninja rope. Just like weapons, learning how to use each is of paramount importance. Using the jetpack as a convenience tool, for example, and not to get out of a jam probably isn't the best idea, especially since you only get a limited number of each (weapons and gadgets). It's a decent mix of items, even if it's not as impressive as in other Worms games. It's closer to the number and styling of the first games in the series. It would have been far cooler to see a list of PSP-exclusive weapons or, at least, a bunch of new ones.    The single-player portion, never the strongest aspect in any Worms title, packs about what you'd expect. There's an option for quick matches and an option for custom matches, too. You can choose from a number of different stages, such as winter, hell, space and desert stages. It's only an aesthetic difference, but each stage is randomly generated every time you play so the layout changes. This, of course, helps deepen the level of strategy of the game, not to mention its replay value. Apart from that though, there's not much control over level-creation or match customization. You just choose the number of teams and the level of difficulty (Beginner, Intermediate and Pro) and go at it.       That's not to say Open Warfare doesn't include anything new. Like most PSP offerings, it takes advantage of the system's wireless Ad-Hoc functionality and allows two or four players to battle. You can choose from among a number of teams, including Champions, Marines and Rookies, but they each behave and play the same.   It also has a hot swap mode where players can use one system and one copy of the game to play against each other. It's nowhere near as cool and convenient as Game Sharing, though. And for a game built around a multiplayer experience, you'd think including that would be a total no-brainer. But, swapping systems works well enough.    As basic as the premise behind Open Warfare is, and as little as the game has changed in its transition to the PSP, you'll still find some annoying quirks. To start, enemies exhibit very strange artificial intelligence. At times, they'll show signs of HAL 9000-level precision while at other times they seem no more intelligent than your average lemming. It's irritating having opposing worms accidentally kill themselves only to turn around and see them execute wickedly precise attacks.    Here's an example - a worm could lob a grenade from one side of the screen and have it ricochet in such a way as to land directly on top of your head, then that same worm would turn around and blow itself up along with two or three of its mates. Apart from this, the game just doesn't run very smoothly. Using the analog stick to move the camera feels sluggish.   Worms: Open Warfare is a decent game that doesn't offer much in terms of new content. It's great for fans who want a faithful iteration of the series on the PSP. It's also a good game to play in quick 10-minute bursts. But if you find yourself bored with strategic silliness, or if you never liked Worms to begin with, there's not much here to love.", "date": "Mar 27, 2006"}
