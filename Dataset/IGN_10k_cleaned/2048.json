Yes, it was a long time ago, as we naturally assumed that Floigan Brothers would be a brand new type of platformer game.  Such lofty words made Floigan Brothers one of most overhyped titles for the Dreamcast and as the months passed without any new word on the status of Floigan Brothers, we began to think it was all just a dream.  When we finally heard word that the project was still in the works, many gamers just laughed the title off.  Well, finally the game is out and while it's far from being the Mario for the Dreamcast, it's certainly a title that will make you laugh, but for all the right reasons.  When was the last time a video game made you laugh?  Okay, I'm not talking about stuff like Ducati World, a game that's so bad you have to laugh... I'm talking about a game that actually sets out to make you grin, giggle, and laugh out loud because of the zany antics, humorous dialogue, or absurd situations.  Stupid Invaders certainly had its moments (see Dung Factory) though sometimes the toilet humor was a bit much and the PS2's Escape From Monkey Island has some great sequences of clever humor.  But there hasn't been too many games that has gone down the path of capturing the classic cartoon elements from the days of Tex Avery, Looney Tunes, Tom & Jerry, and others.  Call me simplistic, but seeing classic cartoon standards like characters getting flattened into a pancake never seem to get too old.  Floigan Brothers is a throwback to classic cartoon humor and combined with great visuals, jazzy tunes, excellent voice acting, and interesting puzzles, it's almost easy to forget the couple of flaws this interactive cartoon game possesses.  Yes, even though the project has been in the works for so long, it still has a couple of flaws that need to be addressed.  For the most part, camera angles aren't too problematic.  However, there are instances where the camera would get behind a wall completely obstructing your view; you would have to fudge with the camera controls (using the R and L Triggers) to get the camera back in the proper viewing position.  Additionally, in open spaces you have complete 360 degree rotation of the camera, but once you get into a smaller area, the game restricts your camera movements. That's fine and dandy, but the angles they offer in these ~restricted~ viewing area don't give you enough to see; this can lead to running into enemies that you can't see at all (i.e. spiders).  But by far the biggest flaw in the game is the length; if you know exactly what to do, where to go, and how to solve the puzzles, you can breeze through this game in a little over an hour.  Yes, an hour. It doesn't help that the puzzles aren't that challenging; most just require a little bit of thought on how to get Moigle to interact with certain obstacles.  It's such a shame that these few flaws might hamper your overall enjoyment as Floigan Brothers delivers great looks, awesome sounds, and cartoon comedy that will have anyone who has laughed at a Tex Avery cartoon smile with great delight.  Like all cartoons, the story of Floigan Brothers is an integral part of the game.  You play Hoigle, and as the brains in the Floigan team, you're constantly guiding Moigle, your younger but larger brother.  You see, Moigle has a special secret project he's working on, but being younger and not quite as smart as Hoigle, he needs your help to find the missing seven parts of the project.  .  To do this, you'll need to interact with your brother a lot and in several different ways.  The most basic is simply pointing with the Point button; press the point button and guide the arrow to the area where you want Moigle to go or to the object you want Moigle to see.  Then comes the physical means which ranges from giving hugs to Moigle (making him feel better), punching your big galoot in the gut (which enrages him), or giving him food to eat (which makes him happy enough to learn new things).  Of course, you'll definitely need to talk to Moigle, leading to the Speak command.  When you push the Speak button, a menu system pops up with various actions Hoigle will perform.  For example, you can ask Moigle if he wants to play a game (and he never says no), insult him to make him feel sad, or even check out the points.  Points are the ~monetary unit~ of the game, but in the end serve no real purpose of value other than bragging rights (Moigle will often tease by saying I've got more points than you!). However, points are far from being worthless as you'll need them to teach Moigle new skills, games, and tricks and you might need to bribe him with your points.  You see, as much as Moigle loves you, he can be a pretty stubborn fellow to work with and when he doesn't do what you say, you can't exactly slug him in the nose... mostly due to Hoigle's height.  Hence, you need to bribe him by giving him a few of your points to add on to his point total.  You won't have to do this often though since Moigle is pretty obedient to his older brother.  Manipulating all those command elements is the main part of the gameplay; the other major part is playing mini-games.  Mini-games come in two forms: games that are only played Hoigle and Moigle, and enemy sequence games.   While you deal with pesky magpies and spiders, there's a pretty evil baddie by the name of Baron Malodorous who's a combination of Dick Dastardly of Wacky Races fame and a Blue Meanie from the Beatles cartoon, Yellow Submarine.  Together with his cat troops, he wants to drive away the Floigans so the junkyard will be his.  Why?  Because he wants a darn junkyard, folks!  While you never get to encounter Baron Malodorous himself, you'll definitely encounter his cat troops as they set up bunkers and toss bombs to drive them away.  Add to this mix, a very cute but sharp-clawed kitten and you've got quite a handful to take care of; just remember a few cartoon rules: cats have nine lives, and bullets make great tennis balls.  There's a whole lot of zany antics and definite cartoon references when you play certain games and that's certainly helped by the great visuals and awesome sounds.  Making a cartoony game in 3D isn't an easy chore; to truly give that cartoony feel, you have to use some really neat stretching and warping techniques.  Floigan Brothers certainly displays this with great flair  whether it's Hoigle getting flattened like a pancake, Moigle adjusting his stomach, or Moigle chasing a butterfly, the visuals are entertaining and the animations of the characters hilarious.  It really helps that the game is very colorful with great setting designs  there's tons of stuff to look at and play around with.  The game does exhibit some frame rate issues; it'll be running at a nice 60 fps but when you have Hoigle trotting down a hill, it drops down a bit.  It's not really that noticeable but the trained eye will be able to see this.  More than the visuals though, the music, sound effects, and voice acting really lend a big hand in making this game more like a cartoon. The voices are extremely well done and fit the characters just right.  Sound effects all have that classic cartoony sound and totally complement the cartoon antics of explosions from bombs, the bullet sound as Moigle dashes away, and the wheezing throwing sounds when you throw stuff with Moigle.  Add to this, some great jazzy tunes that fit the bill in every situation and you've got some high production values for a great cartoon.  Ultimately, the big downfall will be its length and once again, it's not some unfunny joke told my Hoigle  you can really beat this game in about an hour.  SEGA has realized this and priced it quite reasonably ($19.99) but even then, there raises the question of replayability.  Sure, you can get online and trade Moigles with different skillsets and costumes, and there's that monthly download you can get as well.  Still, many gamers will turn down this fantastic cartoony title because of its short length and that's a very valid reason.  But for what it is, Floigan Brothers is a fantastic experiment and experience and hopefully, unlike some cartoons, we'll see more episodes of the zany duo that will hopefully last a bit longer.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Jul 30, 2001"}
