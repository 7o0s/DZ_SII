Those people are dead wrong. PC fishing simulators have become a strong genre unto themselves, with titles that sit at the top of the stack, like Trophy Bass 2, old classics like Gone Fishin', and real dogs like WizardWorks' newest release Pro Bass Fishing.  Obviously a sling-out release to capitalize on the development team's success with other sportsmen oriented titles like Deer Hunter, Pro Bass Fishing contains little in the way of features or even eye-candy to help it compare in anyway to any other fishing title out there. Unlike most fishing games available, Pro Bass Fishing allows no modifications in temperature or time of day (although it does let players select from three basic weather types, sunny, overcast, or rain). When players have their weather condition set (which shouldn't take very long) their ready to pick their fishing hole  from a list of six made-up lakes. That's right, those who are thinking about hitting the big time lakes of the champions will instead be confronted with a series of pools straight out of Fantasyland. This may explain the game's next big disappointment  apparently all of the other 'pro' fisherman couldn't find your imaginary fishin' holes, because they never make any sort of appearance in the game. Despite the title 'Pro Bass Fishing', the game includes no tournament or multi-player modes at all. What's the point? Even those who are into fishing for its own sake will have a hard time with that question as they spend their time piloting around the lake, looking for fish on the fish locator, and casting their line into the water. That's all there is to it. Doesn't exactly sound like a great day at the lake does it?  Sound bad? I haven't even gotten to the casting system yet, easily the single worst ever found in a fishing title. Once players have picked their spot and selected their lure, they'll cast their line only to find that the boat's position at the bottom of the screen never changes. This means that casts of 40 or 50 yards still only look as if they're a few feet from the boat. The whole effect is not only disorienting, but also extremely disappointing as it keeps players from enjoying the beauty of the lakes where they are fishing.   The really sad thing about this game is that it's probably going to sell fairly well. It will be purchased in countless 'impulse buys' and as gifts by people who don't really understand that there are a lot better fishing games available on the market. If you've got a birthday coming up, or have friends or family who tend to buy you gifts on a regular basis, go ahead and warn them now about this terrible, terrible game so that you won't have to embarrass everyone involved by having to take it back later. A new low in fishing games. -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Aug 19, 1998"}
