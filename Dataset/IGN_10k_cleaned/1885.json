Chevy owners need something to do when they are stuck on the side of the road... Okay, please keep the laughter to a minimum -- we don't need anyone wetting him or herself because of lame joke that I decided to open this review with. I figured it's a two and a half month late review of a $10 game, so the chances are pretty good that nobody is even going to read this, so I could get away with saying anything. Anyway, let's move on...   Developed by Empire Interactive, Ford Racing is one of Take 2 Interactive's budget-priced games for the PlayStation that's priced to sell to the masses at a manufacturer's suggested retail price of $9.99. At less than $10, it's definitely a huge bargain, but it's not necessarily worth the little bit of cash that's being asked for it.   The game's premise is either something that'll really appeal to you or completely disgust you. If you're a diehard fan of Ford who has said the joke that I led off this review with, you're probably one of the people that find a racing game based completely on Fords somewhat alluring. However, if you're one of those people that like to use various acronyms to make fun of Ford, like Fails On Race Day, Fix Or Repair Daily, For Only Retarded Drivers or many of the other commonly used phrases, then this is likely a game idea that disgusts you.   Gameplay Whether you fall into the Ford or anti-Ford camp, Ford Racing really has too many negative issues in the gameplay department for it to be a worthwhile racing game for anyone. The game offers a grand total of 11 Ford automobiles, including the Ka, Fiesta, Puma, Focus, Contour, Explorer, Cougar, Taurus, F150, Mustang, GT90 and eight tracks in all with only four completely different ones.   One of the game's more readily apparent problems is that only the first three car types are available at the onset for the Quick Start mode, so if you want to quickly jump into one of the more high-powered Fords you can't. In order to open up the faster, more exciting, vehicles you have to dredge through the game's Career Mode, which is more tedious and boring than anything else.   The Career Mode is setup so that players compete in a set of four or more different races that are varied in the number of laps and the types of cars being used, with the slower cars being used at the start. The user has no choice in the type of car or the color of the car and must just race each event in the season in order and then move on to the next season if enough points are earned by placing high in the various races.   Money can be won to buy upgrades in the form of things like different tires, tuned up engines and the ability to adjust stuff like the brakes, gearbox, aerodynamics and suspension. But, this doesn't really become too much of a factor until you get deep into a Career and some of the additions can only be used in Qualifying races, which aren't ever really important because you can easily get to the front of the pack in most races within the first 30 seconds of the first lap.   One you get on the track and begin racing, most users will find that the control of the different vehicles are fairly tight and responsive, but maybe a little too tight and responsive. Cars will rarely, if ever, spin out and it's far too easy to correct mistakes if you take the incorrect racing lines on difficult turns. The physics have a realistic feel to them, but the gameplay definitely is more geared towards the fans of arcade-style racing.   What really kills this game is the computer AI, or better yet, the complete lack of any sense of artificial intelligence. The CPU-controlled vehicles stay on a pretty basic racing line and won't adjust to you or other vehicles on the track. If you get in the way, the computer will simply try and push you out of the way and will often shove you off the track. The collision detection is a bit shoddy in that the other cars will bump into you when there's still a noticeable visual gap between you and them and a computer car hitting you on the left or right rear of your vehicle will slow you down, which is unrealistic and completely annoying.   Simply put, the track design is unimaginative and boring. Turns just seem to be thrown in for the sake of having them and there are far too many ways to cheat on corners, so players aren't forced to learn the realistic racing lines of the tracks. The bad track designs, non-existent AI and lack of flexibility in the game's career mode help make this a game that's probably not worth buying even at less than $10.   Graphics The visuals are very clean and the game has a solid framerate, but it's pretty obvious that luxuries were taken with the quality of the textures and the backgrounds in order to get it to move smoothly. The cars look like their real-life counterparts, but the models don't even come close to what was offered in either Gran Turismo or Gran Turismo 2.   Likewise, the tracks are thinly detailed and most segments are almost completely devoid of any interesting background elements. The sky is one of the worst that's ever been in a PlayStation racing game and the classic lens-flare is more of a joke than anything else.   Things improve with some of the later tracks in the game, but the best track in this game would still be the worst in any of the GT, Ridge Racer or Need for Speed games. And while the game does have a relatively clean look on the whole, there are some seaming problems with the polygons on the cars and backgrounds and the collision detection on the cars is somewhat sketchy in that you can be bumped by other cars when there's a noticeable space in between you and the other car.   Sound The background music is pretty standard stuff that's fairly common in most racing games. It has a techno-ish beat with repetitive drumbeats that really get unnerving quite quickly. The music isn't so bad that it actually detracts from the gameplay, but it definitely doesn't enhance the gaming experience. It might be more tolerable if you're taken a couple hits of E, but that's definitely something that we wouldn't recommend doing at any time.   Things don't get much better when you move on to the engine noises either. The cars don't really seem to mimic their real life counterparts and the variety of engine noises from car to car doesn't appear too varied, as they all seem to have the same basic hum with a lot of bass.  The only thing going for Ford Racing is that it's priced to sell at less than $10, which won't really put a dent in anyone's wallet whether they're making a six-figure salary or get cash for videogames by selling sperm or blood on the weekends. But even at that price, it's not that great of a bargain, especially since much better games can be had for just $10 more in Sony's Greatest Hits line-up, such as the original Gran Turismo, Gran Turismo 2, Need for Speed I, II, III & High Stakes, Wipeout, Ridge Racer and several others. The only reasons there are to get this game is if you've already played every single other racing game on the PlayStation and just want something new to play or you're a diehard fan of Ford automobiles and feel the need to support your favorite car manufacturer. Otherwise, there are much better racing games on the system that are comparatively priced.", "date": "Apr 5, 2001"}
