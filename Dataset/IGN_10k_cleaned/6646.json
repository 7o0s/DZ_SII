The sport's pacing is perfect for the kind of handsets people in America use the most -- namely, the ones that are $50 with a two-year contract. Digital Chocolate, recognizing that the install base for these more pedestrian handsets is huge, set out to craft a series of mobile mini golf games that are easy to pick-up-and-play without taxing the hardware. Mini Golf Las Vegas is the latest in this series -- however, DChoc is indeed offering a 3D edition for the few and the proud walking around with more powerful phones.   Right away, the theme for this mini golfer is a winner. DChoc has really nailed the fun and glitz of Sin City, setting three nine-hole courses in different casinos that are clever take-offs of existing titans. (The Miracle versus the Mirage, the Luxury versus the Luxor...) The duffers you choose from are a breezy bunch, from the white blazer-wearing Ethan to Amber, who wears blue eye shadow without any care that it's now 2006, not 1986.   The theme carries over to the course design itself. Holes feature slot machines that rack up points, coins you can roll the ball over to get extra points, roulette wheels, and more. It's a fun game to look at, and in some respects that good will carries over to the game play.   However, while Mini Golf Las Vegas doesn't roll craps, this is not the definitive mobile mini golfer I was hoping for. While it certainly packs a lot of content (27 holes and potentially more courses via future downloads), I just wasn't crazy about some of the controls. You line up a shot with just 4 and 6. This is fine -- it's easy and is what goes a long way toward making the game initially accessible.   But when it's time to actually make the putt, you hold down 5 to power up the shot. The amount of power is represented by a meter on the bottom of the screen, which fills up the longer you hold down the 5 key. With no visual correlation between the amount of power and how much distance you'll get out of it, you'll find yourself often hitting the ball too hard or not hard enough. This can get frustrating after a while. I recognize and appreciate that I'm not supposed to barrel through the entire game getting birdies on my first try, but I would like to see some indicator that my power is roughly in the right ballpark. This doesn't ruin the game, but it does dampen my enthusiasm to a certain degree.   The game also offers multiplayer for up to four people by passing the phone around.   Like Moto Racing Fever, Mini Golf Las Vegas comes in two editions: 2D and 3D. They are the exact same game, just with changes in dress. Each game allows you to scan the entire course before taking your shot, but the 3D version allows you to really get in there and inspect the angles. The player models in the 3D version have extra animations, but not necessarily more detail than the 2D sprites.  Mini Golf Las Vegas is a decent mini golf game, but not the final answer in the category. I like that the control is simple and lining up your shots is easy, but I wish there was some greater indication of when my power is in the correct neighborhood. You won't be handing over victory by offering this -- I can blow the finesse part on my own just fine, thank you. However, the theme is fantastic and the game looks great. If you can reconcile the atmosphere with what I believe is the game's lone shortcoming, then by all means, take a download. But I'm holding out for the next mini golf game.", "date": "Feb 21, 2006"}
