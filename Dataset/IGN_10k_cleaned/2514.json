It's weird, like saying Sega just made a Mario game, or Namco just made a simulation racer. It just doesn't equate. And yet, here we are, with Sony Computer Entertainment's 989 Sports taking on EA and Konami with it's very own Team Soho-developed soccer (football) game.  World Tour Soccer 2002 is indeed a competitor right off the bat, holding its own in several categories on the field, some in gameplay, some in graphics, a few in features modes and whatnot, with mechanics, physics, and pacing all quite well handled, really. What gets me about this is that World Tour is not far from bring very good -- you know dazzling, a complete package of great gameplay, graphics and sound, and yet still so far away.   Gameplay  World Tour Soccer 2002, originated in the UK by Studio Soho, the guys who might just bring you The Getaway this millennium, have created a solid, sim-style soccer game for just about anyone to enjoy. Fashioned after a more realistic-style soccer game, World Tour plays in many ways like ESPN MLS ExtraTime, or what fans call International Superstar Soccer. It's fast and simulation-like, but it feels a different than any other soccer game I've played before, in some ways better, in others not quite as good. It's a tad less simmy than ISS, and leans a little toward FIFA in terms of arcadey-ness, but only a little.   World Tour is packed with 300 teams and clubs from all across the world, from American teams to England, Germany, France, Brazil, Italy, and it enables players to choose from 11 different leagues. So if you wanted to just play in the Spanish league or only in the Italian league, it's yours for the taking.  With the ability to play in the national seasons of the English, Spanish, Dutch, French, Italian, German Scottish, Belgian, and Portuguese, players can vie for the top slot in those leagues and in those cups, if they choose. Given the chance to compete in older or classic clubs, players can venture back in to time to dig out their old favorite teams, along with the players who comprised those teams. But don't expect to play in any American leagues, the MLS license ain't here.   World Tour delivers several modes, including Quick Game (an instant match with only one choice, the team you select), Exhibition (in which you select the team, place, and competition), a National Season (in which you play through the season of a professional foreign team), Special Competition (with such competitions as Superteam Competition, TimeWarp League, Jumper 4 Posts, Custom League, TimeWarp Cup, and Custom Cup), and International Competition (which features many tournaments, including European and American Cups). The few things that one would like to add are a franchise mode and the ability to play Major League Soccer, complete with American teams. But alas, these modes don't exist here. Still, with full official use of the FIFPro license, World Tour contains a wealth of teams, 300 teams in the international body, and all 5,000-plus team players to boot.   Since World Tour plays a bit more like ISS, players have the ability to create their own plays, using accurate passing to create from scratch, including through-pass plays, loose triangle-style offenses, and with the use of the Auto-Crossing Zone, players can generally ramp up their crossing game to a good level once they've the hang of it. The button configuration is easy to learn, and stronger presses equal harder shots, while tapping and holding passes, for instance, produce a small bevy of built-in plays. While I always prefer the through-pass game, with the Advanced Offense moves, players can execute regular one-two ground passes, one-two chip passes, give-and-goes, and for long kicks, players can swerve the ball, using the dpad or left analog to adjust the ball in mid-air. There are also moves for deliberate dives, spins, step-overs, shimmies, and the ability to knock the ball ahead. I found myself pulling some of these off at inopportune times once too often, but in technical terms of purely working, they do fine. And although there is a bit of slowdown once in a while, the relative smoothness of World Tour is solid.   Although I don't remember ever doing this in any other soccer game, in World Tour I found that often times I could kick the ball at the referee, and even run into him by accident. The problem being that the ref got in my way and blocked a few of my mid-field passes, bumming me out. I never lost a game because of him, butAnyway, with regard to the AI, I found that the teams varied in styles of play and aggressiveness, and they also varied slightly each time I played them. The better teams scored early, and pulled off dribbling moves of their own -- pausing for you to steal the ball, and then dribbling around you, quickly creating spaces in your defense, stealing loose balls often, and cutting off imperfect passes. As the season progressed I could instantly tell the difference in the toughness of the other team. While the World Class and Master levels are monstrously hard, they provide serious challenge to the well worn gamer.   With regard to the AI of my own goalie, I was very surprised at how many saves he made in a single game. In once situation, my defense was on the ropes, in all sorts of bad positions, and the goalie blocked four straight shots, three of which were rebounds. I was amazed at his performance. The opposing goalies also played intelligently. In another scenario, the ball was less than half way between the opposing goalie and myself, being slightly closer to me. He ran out to get it, saw that I had gained control, and then backed up into position in the goal. I scored, but he saved his polygonal butt from injury.   World Tour feels good with regard to passes and shots. The control is accurate and responsive, and I didn't feel I was cheated out of any goals or was robbed by the AI. Of course, in any soccer game there is a good amount of adjustment to the controls and the way the game feels, but I was able to get the feel for this relatively quickly. There are a few gripes that should be known, however. Trying to save a ball from going out of bounds, for instance, is a joke. Players appear to be magnetized to the ball, and they can't run around a slowly moving ball to prevent it from crossing the line. It always seems to fail. Likewise, even with the camera far from the field, seeing how you're going to pass in to is difficult, on offense and on defense.   My biggest complaint seems like a silly one, but no matter how long I set the games for, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, or whatever, it didn't matter, the game length always seemed too short. The clock sped like The Flash from one minute to 90 in what seemed like five minutes. The result was that I ended up with far too many 0-0 ties. I did indeed find the option length in the menus, and I changed up the way in which a game could end, with extra time or Golden Goal, but nonetheless, these games are too short for my liking.   Graphics Team Soho's game looks solid enough, but overall it lacks the sparkle and polish that other soccer games offer. The body textures are decent, but the faces and body shapes all appear veryawkward. Either these are some of the ugliest men on the face of the earth  or Sony's artists were bent on making tools of these guys. Also, there appears to some weird contortions between the shoulder, arms and necks of these players. Weird.   And then there is the hair. Being a bald man, it's easy for me to appreciate hair. Real soccer players tend to have some of the worst hair on earth, and Team Soho has apparently picked up on that fine detail. The simple fact is that the players in World Tour present the worst hair ever in a videogame. These guys all have SUPER BAD HAIR.   World Tour 2002 has been built up relatively quietly from the folks at 989 Sports, but what they have focused on is facial expression and body movement. The players do own distinct facial expressions, though not at the level I've seen in American football games from Sega and EA, or even in FIFA. And the only time you really see them is during a penalty (red or yellow card), or during before, during halftime, or after the game. When carded, players throw fits, pushing their fists into the air, looking into the sky, or turning away in disgust. It's all run-of-the-mill stuff, and nothing to get excited about. Their faces don't actually change expression all that often, nor is there too many expressions, so for all the build up, the result is a letdown.     The crowds and stadia all appear in good shape, but neither appears to ever change all that dramatically. You'd be hard pressed to notice the differences in the crowds or the stadia. Other than that, I can't comment on the accuracy of the replications of the stadia since I haven't been to any of them, but from what I can tell they are look wonderfully oval and tall, and they all have nice green lawns in them, which is always a stellar idea for soccer gamesThe crowds comprise several simple animations that, once all running together, do the job.   Replays can be pressed through, but for those who enjoy seeing how they scored, the default replay shows off at least three good angles of the play, and how the opponents reacted. Thee are respectable replays, but often it shows how close the defense was to tripping you or clipping through your legs, or how poorly the net moves in slow motion. Also during replays, the game shows off some ugly mip-mapping problems. These essentially cause textures to bug out, or flip around unnaturally, and as a result it causes weird confusing depth of field problems...   It's nice to see the different weather effects in any game, and in World Tour, at least they look good in the intros. But unfortunately, when it rains or snows, the field doesn't appear to receive any of it during the game, nor does the field appear to wear down. It actually does snow and rain on these fields, but during the game you can hardly see the weather at all. You can see players breathing out steam in very cold weather, but that's about it.   Sound  When it comes to sound in soccer, the whole field is rather small. There's the sound of the crowd chanting or yelling (in this case, it's just a constant roar or fans roaring all at once, like the sea crashing against the shore, regardless of which stadium you're in), the music in the menus and at the intro, and the sound of the announcer himself. And that's pretty much it -- real simple like.   Since I've told you everything about the crowd now (see the paragraph above), I'll get right into the announcing. Compared to most announcing, Peter Drury does decent, middle-of-the-road work. He doesn't say offensive things, he say entirely wrong things, but after a game or two you have heard all he has to say, and it's just as good to turn off the announcing after four or five games, because you really have heard it all. It's innocuous, but the lack of color, the lack of variety, and the general blandness of the announcing is a real letdown. Personally, I'm unmoved. World Tour Soccer 2002 is good enough to play and have a good time, but there are better games out there, and this game just makes me want to wait for Konami's next effort, which is hopefully the American version of Winning Eleven 5.  World Tour Soccer 2002 does a great job of providing deep, international soccer and the gameplay style is based on my style of soccer, but this game has a lot of catching up to do with regard to little things such as throw-ins, menu options, and length. It also has some big things to work on, namely graphics, sound, and hair, hair, hair! Anyway, if you love and need soccer so badly that you're going to die then get this. If you're a little picky, rent it first.", "date": "Feb 27, 2002"}
