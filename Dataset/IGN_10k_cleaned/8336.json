Detective Puzzles is a PI-themed series of mini-games woven into four different cases, each of increasing difficulty. In order to solve each crime, you much successfully complete each mini-game within either a time limit or a set number of chances. If you blow the case, the perp waltzes and you cool your heels in your dramatically lit office.   The mini-games are a decided mixed bag. The sketch artist game, where you are given only a few seconds to memorize a face before having to piece together the mug on the pad, works. So does the phone tapping sequence, which challenges you to match up tonal signal with corresponding numbers. Each number represents an oscillating blip and you only have a set number of opportunities to place the call before the tap is lost. Not so fun: The driving mini-game which has to switching gears to catch up to a speeding car. The evidence matching game is perhaps the strangest and most troublesome of the bunch. There is a pattern of matching faces to weapons to rooms, and you have to investigate the entire scene to determine what goes where.   Each case features some static shots with sepia toned scenes and back story. Between each mini-game, you read over the thoughts/journal of the gumshoe working the case. Everybody is hardboiled in the Edward G. Robinson sense of the word. I liked the context for the game quite a bit, actually. I think basing games on intriguing occupations -- detective, cake baker -- is a solid formula. I just wish the mini-games that make up Detective Puzzles were a little more engaging and plentiful.  Detective Puzzles is a great idea that is undermined by some bum mini-games. The writing and atmosphere is dead-on, but there needs to be more and better games to support the premise. Reaxion and Ojom shouldn't abandon this angle. I'd definitely like to see a sequel with new mini-games that are case-specific. Maybe a mini-game where you have to study two crime scene pictures to identify the differences? Or a dancing mini-game where you have to press a torch singer for information on her no-good boyfriend?", "date": "Apr 4, 2007"}
