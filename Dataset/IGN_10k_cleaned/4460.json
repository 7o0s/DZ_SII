Battles were held on spaceships and alien planetscapes in the 41st millennium. Scrapping the idea entirely of a strategy game, developer Kuju has taken the same worlds and characters and created a big and loud FPS that may not break any ground, but provides some decent action for fans of Warhammer 40,000 and first-person shooter fans who want a quick diversion.   Gameplay   Fire Warrior immediately drops the main character, a warrior from the Tau race, into the thick of a battle situation and keeps the pace up through the rest of the game. It's not the most complicated of games, but it's fun enough to play through the whole thing. With a standard set of weapons to fight with, any experienced FPS fan should be able to get through pretty quickly.   Fire Warrior follows one story arc that travels through 20 connected missions. Cinematics and in-game cutscenes drive the story along and seamlessly keep the action going along at a steady clip. While the story is simple enough to be told in just a couple paragraphs, it's still a nice touch to keep all of the missions consecutive because it helps to keep up the overall momentum of the game.   The missions here are pretty straightforward. There are some of the ~get the blue key for the door~ type of quests as well as opening up lots of gates. Other than that, it's all about moving forward and killing everything in sight. One section has a dozen or so snipers that need to be taken out with a sniper rifle, but it's usually the big guns that get you through.    Experienced FPS fans will have no problem plowing through the game on the normal difficulty setting. After finishing the game, you can skip around to any mission and have another go, trying to beat your own best time and improve your accuracy. Doing so will unlock bonus features such as a left-handed weapon. Unfortunately, the hard difficulty setting is only available after the normal game has been completed. While it's good for greener gamers to have the normal and easy modes, it would've been even better to have a hard mode from the beginning and an ~insane~ mode for hardcore gamers.     The range of weapons here is pretty standard fare, featuring everything from machine guns to a rail gun and a missile launcher. The rail gun is a particular favorite of mine since it rewards accuracy and quickly takes down the biggest enemies the fastest. These weapons usually just appear later on in the game, left on the ground. One weapon, a particularly powerful small missile launcher, is acquired by taking down a minor demon which adds some to it. I'd prefer if every weapon was earned. For example, if you killed a sniper, you'd get the sniper rifle. As it is, guns and ammo are all over the floors as if a gun shop had just exploded.   As the game progresses, the enemies become bigger and more powerful, but not much smarter. With a couple of exceptions, the demons are mostly large and lumbering beasts. Aside from learning to dodge their blasts and shoot back there's little in the way of strategy required. The humans fare only slightly better and that's when they're equipped with sniper rifles.   Instead of the moving arsenal that most first-person shooters favor, Fire Warrior only allows two weapons to be carried at a time. Sometimes this can force a decision of what is the perfect gun for each situation. Often, this decision is practically made for you since there will be just a couple different kinds of weapons lying around.   If you want to have some extensive multiplayer action, you're out of luck here. There are three modes of play: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Capture the Flag. While they played smoothly, each one only has two maps to choose from and TDM and CTF have the same two maps. That's only four maps in all. Wanting to play some battles against other ign.com staffers, I was hoping for at least a dozen options. After spending some ten minutes exploring the minute options, it was time to check out the online play.    The evil of the limited amount of maps rears its ugly head here. Only eight maps are here for online play, split in half for the DM and TDM/CTF modes. A couple of these maps are throwaways, too. One is only an open square with a ledge and a scaffold to climb on. Another is barely more than a couple of rooms with two passageways. After playing for an hour, I was desperately craving some more places to run and more levels to shoot between. While a couple of the levels had some interesting ideas, a lot more could have been done to spice them up.    Besides changing the time and score limits, there's no other options for customizing the online games. The weapons are all included in every map and there's no way to limit what kind of game it can be. Before a game, it's possible to chat in the lobby, but there's no general chat area or ladder system.    In fact, there is barely any customizing in Fire Warrior at all. Enter the options menu and the only option is to set the volume of the sound effects and whether to hear them in mono, stereo, reverse stereo, or surround sound. Tweaking controls is completely not an option. It's not even possible to choose to invert the mouse or not. If the controls work fine for you, this game could be all right. If not, forget about it.   Graphics   Making textures look great and the interface smooth is important to Fire Warrior. This game definitely looks polished and well designed. My favorite graphical flourish is the directional pointer. Some missions are guided along through the HUD. Look away from the target, and a green triangle shows the correct direction. Face the target and a number representing distance is displayed between two brackets. Sure, it may sound too easy, but it takes the guesswork from the grunt work and got me back into the action as quick as it could.      Sound   There is no music during the action, just a whole lot of sound effects. Guns, air vents, shouts, and explosions fill up the audio. Since the pace is so quick, there is seldom any time the even needs the music. Only after I had finished the game and went back to check did I realize it was never there. The sound effects themselves were enough for me. Professionally done and easily distinguishable, they did their job in helping to create the world.   The voice acting is a whole other matter. Half the time, the Tau race sound as if they're trying to put on some halting Japanese accent. It's impossible to take seriously and really is the main downpoint of the presentation of the whole game. It's not enough to really detract from the game, but it would've been great if it was better.Fire Warrior takes a standard first-person adventure and does a good job of providing a continuous adventure in an established world. The look and feel of Warhammer 40,000 and solid design combine for a fun, if a bit brainless, bit of FPS action. Hardcore FPS fans will find little new here, but it's perfect for fans of the original game and others looking for a quick shoot-em-up. Since all of the options that normally accompany a FPS title have been stripped from the game, this is definitely for the casual gamer or an extreme fan of the original strategy game.", "date": "Feb 13, 2004"}
