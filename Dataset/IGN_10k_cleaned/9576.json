Surprisingly enough, Psygnosis, a company known mostly for their action and racing titles, is one of the bold new entries, vying for electronic sportsmen's dollars with their slick looking Pro 18. The game features four great courses portrayed with amazing detail, loads of play options, excellent sound and an interesting new take on the traditional computer golf swing that adds new challenge for those who have mastered the nuances of the three click meter. Unfortunately, the game also suffers from several fundamental design problems  terrible putting, inconsistent advice, and a lack of good view options  that keep it firmly in the ~pass over~ category.  Let's start with the good stuff. Pro 18 offers up four really nice international courses, The Royal County Down in Ireland, The Lost City in South Africa, the Coeur d'Alene in Idaho (that's in the U.S. for those of you who don't own a map) and the Royal Birkdale in England. All of the courses are presented very nicely and have been painstakingly surveyed to be accurate down to the meter. The game's graphics are based on a photo realistic engine that serves up views that must look exactly like the real thing. Once you get the game up and running, everything is presented to you as if it were being covered by a crack team of sportcasters, and although this sounds pretty damn irritating, it's actually kind of cool. Their banter continues while you're on the course, but I never found it to be too distracting and actually kept it on the whole time I was playing the game  a first in my experience with computer golf.  The play options are another strong point. In addition to standard Stroke play, you have the option to enter a Tournament (where the sportscast feel of the game really pays off), take on an ultra-quick Shootout, compete in a game of skins or try Fourball. There's also a practice mode that lets you hone your skills on a driving range, a chiping area, or a putting green. Each of these different games will let you play with a mouse swing (where you move your mouse to swing the club), the standard three click swing that we've seen in so many different golf games, or the new Pro Swing. This last new system is pretty nice, offering a final fourth motion of the swing meter to represent the movement of the golfer's wrists. After years of perfecting my three-click swing, I found it to be a nice challenge that didn't require so much effort as to be irritating. The game also offers up a huge menu of different shot options, from draws and fades to chips and a custom shot button that allows you to design your own special smacks.  Okay, this all sounds great  what's the problem? The biggest problem is that, simply put, the putting sucks. It's extremely hard to determine where the breaks are in the green, the fast moving control meter makes it much more difficult to sink a close shot than to sink one that's far away, and the vocal advice you receive from the broadcasters on which way the ball will break is often completely incorrect. I can't overemphasize how bad this problem really is  over and over I would make huge drives, work some subtle magic to get on in two and then five put my way to a double bogie. After a few games I simply quit caring how many strokes I had on a given hole, I judged my performance solely on how many strokes it took me to get to the green.  Although the terrible, terrible putting is bad enough, there are a few other issues that I had with the game that sealed its ~I'm heading for the trashcan~ fate. First off, the game offers up no overhead view of the individual holes at any point, so it's impossible to tell where on the course you should be aiming for. It took me four or five times of playing a course before I remembered it well enough to know where I was supposed to be putting the ball on a drive. I found this to be extremely annoying and fairly unrealistic (I bet Mark O'Meara always picks up one of those little scorecards with the course map on it before he hits the links). Of course, there might be an incredible map function available that I don't know about due to the unbelievably poor manual that was included with this title. The small pamphlet offers almost no useable information other than a glossary (which makes up a full quarter of the manual) of golf terms. I know what a bulger is now, but I still don't know where some of the game's features are hidden. Finally, I was really irritated by the lack of a course design option. I'm the kind of golfer that like to play a lot of different courses (or better yet to enter in the ones that I play in real life), and it really irks me when a company doesn't offer me the replay value that a course designer offers.  I'm really disappointed about the final outcome on this title because I found the fairway feel of the game to be so well done. It seems that if the team had put in a little more time in play-testing and manual design that they would have a had a real contender here. As it is, Pro 18 is no real competition for the existing masters at all.  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Jul 13, 1999"}
