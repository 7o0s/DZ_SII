Safari Rescue Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/03/12/go-diego-go-safari-rescue-review-2", "text": "Despite sharing almost the same basic concept (read: collecting stuff) as Dora Saves the Mermaids, Go, Diego, Go! Safari Rescue -- whether by virtue of the fact that it's aimed at a slightly older audience or that it was handled by the rather capable talents over at High Voltage Software (who apparently only do kids games these days) -- is approximately 18 billion times more enjoyable an experience. It's longer, has more variety and actually does a better job of being an edutainment tool. It just feels like an actual game.    It's weird, though; aside from the actual storyline (which involves -- I kid you not -- a mosquito that is swatted by an elephant while trying to do some blood sucking and somehow turns into a witch that starts turning all elephants into stone), there's not a whole lot that Diego does that's different from Dora. He rescues animals, he collects stuff to give him badges, and he has a few race-like events (and I use ~race~ in the most liberal sense possible, though there is a separate mode beyond the story stuff that adds some additional obstacles like jumps and such).    Looks fun. The difference is how the game plays -- namely in that Diego has little things like double-jumps, is a little more responsive when jumping onto swinging vines, and can hop into holes that pop him out somewhere else. The game actually feels a little like Klonoa or Tomba in the way that it uses different depths on a 2D plane to add variety to the levels (not to mention a source of backtracking for budding OCD cases that have to collect everything).    Because the controls are relatively tight and because there's a little more in the way of hop-n-bop action -- not to mention educational bits that explain what animals are and what they do in the wilds of Africa -- it's actually something I would have no problem recommending to parents of younger gamers, particularly because like Dora, it supports having a second controller activated to help guide youngsters around.    Though the game may be more varied, it still follows a fairly simple path: meet up with an animal that is somehow affected by the mosquito/witch/thingie, run around a level diving into holes, sliding down hills and swinging on vines until you get to the end and deliver whatever materials are needed. Chat a little more with the animals, participate in a hang gliding/elephant riding/river rafting/whatever ~race~ and repeat.    Go, Diego, go!  Perhaps the charm of the game is that it's presented fairly well. The animations can be stiff at times, but Diego looks and sounds (again, a good portion of the voice cast from the TV show reprise their roles) a lot like his TV counterpart. The controls are tight, the platforming is simple but varied and the overall feel of things is a little more in line with what you'd expect from a not-quite-value-priced offering. The framerate is decent, the 2D perspective leaves it up to the models to convey most of the pop and the jungle-influenced musical loops keep things interesting.Given that parents can help their kids out and Diego offers some interesting educational bits, I'm actually rather happy to recommend this for fans of the TV show. Older gamers can help out the younger ones with stuff if they get hung up, and kids can sharpen their skills (you still only have to use X and the analog sticks in wiggle mini-games, nothing more). It's a solid little game that is surprisingly decent -- especially compared to 2K's other Nick Games offering.", "date": "Mar 12, 2008"}
