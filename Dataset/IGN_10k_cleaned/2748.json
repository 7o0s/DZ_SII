{"name": "Lilo & Stitch", "name_review": "Disney's Lilo & Stitch", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/06/19/disneys-lilo-stitch", "text": "Just as Mario spawned thousands of platformer wannabes that tried to follow the plumber's path for Nintendo systems, the PlayStation has inspired its share of 3D platformers that take after its signature series: Crash Bandicoot. The problem, unfortunately, is that this style of hop-about just doesn't have the same wide-open gameplay and variety that allowed a few of those Mario clones to stand strong -- whatever goodness there was in this type of game had long been mined to the core by Naughty Dog. Lilo & Stitch may have the spin-dash, it may have the butt-bounce, and it may have the big beasties who chase your character into the camera, but there isn't a platform in the game that you haven't hopped on before.  Gameplay Based on the new Disney movie, Lilo and Stitch has the little Hawaiian hula-girl and her pet dog'ish creature (actually an interstellar fugitive freakazoid critter wanted in several galaxies for causing total devastation with his manic ways) on an adventure together to learn the true meaning of ~Ohana~ together (it's the Hawaiian word for family.) To become truly ~Ohana~ together, the two will have to bounce on floating platforms, collect a number of random widgets, and spin-attack baddies in a few dozen levels and boss battles. Aloha.  You can tell that developer Blitz Games had nothing to work on with this one besides two characters and a colorful island locale. Should Lilo and her mogwai collect leaves, photos, records, pineapples, slabs of bluish food, hibiscus flowers, cups of coffee, film slates, or Voodoo Spoons on their journey? What the heck, collect 'em all! It's platforming nonsense at its most basic level, and none of the trinkets really make the game much fun to bother with -- they're not hidden well enough to tease you and encourage you to come back (the hidden photos and movie clips are fun, but your kids will be owning the DVD in 6 months either way.)  Lack of inspiration aside, this isn't the worst Crash clone to come along, but it's just not nearly as fun as romping with the Bandicoot. The worst of it is that the controls will probably frustrate the kids who would want the game. Bad collision detection and wimpy weapons will mean that kids will go walking right into enemies (even Stitch's super Roll Attack, which should make him an invincible whirling dervish of destruction, lets him get hurt from exploding barrels and other obstacles, making the move pretty much useless.) Floaty jumps that don't stick to platforms well (a common problem with these 3D platformers) means kids will be falling down pits and into rivers constantly.   I'm not sure why kid games tend to be unnecessarily frustrating, but Lilo & Stitch just isn't friendly for little ones (especially the female players who may be picking up a game controller for the first time to play as the plucky girl adventurer.) It's little things that these games, for some reason, never learn from the billions of other bad kids games out there and fix -- am I the only one who's watched kids play these games? For instance, the save system doesn't save automatically after stages (you'll have to read the manual to know that you have to walk up to a mailbox when you want to save) -- from what I've seen of the way kids play games, they will play for an hour, shut it off, then come back and find that they have to start all over again. Kids will also run through their extra lives and get tired of starting a stage over again. And the tight challenges of the game -- the race with Mertle, for instance, give you only a second or two of leeway to win even after you've escaped the number of tricky obstacles in the path, and some gaps that you'll have to jump at full speed can only be cleared by jumping at the very, very last second.) I'm not looking for kids and girl games to be pushovers, but there really needs to be a better crop of games for beginners. Lilo & Stitch is just another example of what not to do and yet another occasion that shows why girls tend not to start playing games at an early age.  Graphics The biggest problem with this game's look is that the Disney picture that it's based on just isn't a dazzler. Lilo is sort of a dumpy-looking wahine, so no matter how close the character gets to the source, you still have this squat little figure as your hero. Stitch isn't much more exciting -- he's a stout blue koala with big teeth. Even at that, the animation isn't much more that functional. Stich's mischief here has dwindled down to a kiddie teddy-bear incarnation -- in the film, he looks like he's rabid; in the game, he smiles and stands on his head.   Outside of the characters, the graphics aren't much more than soft carpeting. PlayStation games tend to come in two flavors -- grainy but detailed, or soft and round without a hint of texture. Lilo & Stitch goes the latter route, with simple lands and bland objects dotting the path. The good thing about the graphic style, on the other hand, is that it pops up nice and clean on a small PS one screen.  Sound The nice thing about a lower-profile Disney picture with no major stars is that everybody in the cast is pretty easy to rope up for voice-over work. There's a good deal of voice-over work here to tell the story -- a nice addition for a simple platformer (and Stitch's manic mutters are always fun to hear.) There's also a selection of music tracks on the soundtrack that kids will notice, including some Hawaiian standards and a few Elvis records (Lilo apparently has a crush on The King in the movie.) There's even a version of the song sung by the ditzy sister in that memorably bad sequence from Dirty Dancing -- what kid doesn't love Dirty Dancing?!?I'd love to be able to recommend this game to young girls who relate to a hero that's their same age and try a PlayStation game for the first time to relive the adventures of the film's spirited little keiki star, but Lilo just doesn't have the Big Kahuna on her side here. Older gamers may be able to handle the play control quirks, but they probably won't find much in this coconut to make them want to bother.", "date": "Jun 19, 2002"}
