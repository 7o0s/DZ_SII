Curly Monsters brings the feverish pace of Wipeout to Xbox with Quantum Redshift, a game lacking in style, flare, and ingenuity.  Hop into a racer, 100 years in the future, taking control of one of 16 drivers.  Race with five other bad asses on-screen at once, including your character-specific nemesis.  The game only gets faster the better you do, so hang on to your butt as you go into the redshift.  Feature  Race at ridiculous speeds with one of 16 drivers Race against up to three of your pals in split-screen action Rival racers take out their grudges on sixteen tracks Four modes of play: Tournament, Time Attack, Quick Race, Multiplayer Customizable soundtracks 5.1 Dolby Digital  Gameplay Quantum Redshift puts you in the seat of a Single Person Armed Racing Craft (SPARC).  Driving at ridiculous speeds, you'll race against five other drivers.  Your goal is to be number one.  Each character has a specific rival who has a special mad-on for them and takes that hatred out on the track.  The character's each have a different, unique background and their own reasons for being in the race.    Tournament Mode will be your main focus when playing Quantum Redshift as it unlocks new speeds, new characters, and new tracks.  While Time Attack, Quick Race, and Multiplayer modes are all nice to have, they follow the same standards as just about every other racer.  Control Redshift is a pretty simplistic game.  You accelerate, powerslide on turns, and press A to boost.  Your boost is recharged after each lap, which is a bit different than the standard racer.  It makes more sense to have boost return gradually or to have a pick-up that increases boost, than to have it doled out after each lap.  Turbo doesn't last long, though you can purchase upgrades in-between races.  There are a handful of pick-ups on the track.  The weapon pick-ups come in red, blue, and yellow, which match the buttons that activate them.  You get straight attacks, homing attacks, and shields.  As you upgrade your weapon systems, these weapons become more powerful, but they never change on the track.  And the locations are never random.  So all you need to do is memorize where they are located and drive accordingly.  It's always fun to have power-ups, but these are so limited and so plain (guns and shields? yawn) that they detract from the game.  There have been so many cart racers out there.  And though the Xbox is almost barren, that doesn't mean this game lives in a vacuum.  It's not enough to do the minimum.  Curly Monsters could have and should have gotten a lot more creative with the power-ups, because they're very ho-hum.  Speed demons At the start of Redshift, you have only seven available drivers and must begin at one of the lowest speed settings.  There are five settings total and each one gives a serious kick to your max speed: Novice, amateur, expert, master, redshift.  You can't instantly jump to the lighting-quick redshift, however.  You've got to beat each speed with at least one character to unlock the next difficulty.  Speed is really the game's main selling point.  If there is anything Redshift does well, it's the feel of incredible speed.  At first, on novice or amateur, it doesn't feel so bad.  It's just a fast racer.  You can see where you're going, can control your SPARC just fine.  But bump that up to expert and the game starts to become difficult.  With the increased speed comes increased difficulty.  It's not that the racers are better, it's that the track is coming at a much greater speed and it's really tough to make all the proper turns.  This can get frustrating as you try and navigate unfamiliar tracks or simply try and stay on certain tracks.  While the increase in speed is a great idea, it doesn't seem to match up with your increased ability.  And once you unlock a new speed with one character, you can use it with anyone.  The harder levels offer greater speeds, but also mean longer races, as you'll have to complete more laps in races.  This way races take about the same time, as the faster speed gets you through a lap faster (assuming you haven't crashed into every wall along the way).    Tune-up The benefit of racing through the earlier difficulties multiple times is that you earn cash, which can be spent to upgrade your SPARC.  Topping the high score (even if it is your own) on a track gets you extra cash.  This forces you to race better on every track in order to earn dough.  That's a great idea and one of the few things that seems progressive in the game.  You can upgrade your weapons system, turbo, or your shield.  Increasing turbo gives you more turbo boosts in each lap.  Shield gives you a longer-lasting and more powerful shield and weapons increase the power and effectiveness of your weapon pick-ups.  Redshift would have been better served to let you buy customizations for your SPARC.  Rather than just an anonymous weapon upgrade, why not let you choose from a variety of weapons?  How about new paint jobs or even faster SPARCs?  After all, I don't just want to have some extra turbo, I want to be able to make my vehicle faster than the others.  Without these things, Quantum Redshift comes off as a glorified cart racer.  You killed my father, prepare to die! Redshift features a rival system, where each character has a specific rival who, for reason revealed in cut-scenes, has a hatred for the other character.  These rivalries are static and have nothing to do with what you do on the track.  They are preprogrammed and the only real affect on gameplay is that your rival will go out of their way to attack you during a race.  Though it was a good thought, the rivalry system is pretty pointless in the game.  We've reached a point in video games where things need to be dynamic in order to be dazzling.  More ambitious games, like Codemaster's Pro Race Driver, will use rivalries and grudges based on your gameplay.  That's innovation.  And the cut scenes are incredibly minimal.  As big as the rivalries are supposed to be, you will hardly see any of it on screen.  In fact, there seems to be little resolution of these rivalries.  If Curly Monsters really wanted to involve gamers in the storyline, there should have been better orchestrated cut-scenes or even events on the track.  As it stands, you will hardly even notice you have a rival.    Build a better track The tracks don't seem to make much of any sense in terms of the rest of the game.  You are in these futuristic hover vehicles but the tracks are similar to your average rally game.  Boring!  There's no activity on the tracks other than your fellow racers and very little in terms of gravity-defying moments.  It almost seems like there was a stopper put on the imaginations of the developers.  They wanted, perhaps, to keep it realistic.  But, uh, who wants realism in a futuristic racer?  I can't say if it's the tracks, the racers, or the mediocre power-ups, but I never felt any intensity playing the game.  I'm going at ridiculous speeds and my only concern is trying to not fall off a ledge.  No worries about winning, no edginess over my nemesis on the track, no sweat on my brow.  And a race should make you clench a bit.  But there is no clenching here.  Can my friend play, too? Multiplayer is split-screen, but surprisingly the game still manages to run fast without slowdown, even with four people playing.  There are some minor changes you probably won't notice.  A few of the effects, like water droplets on your windshield, are gone for multiplayer, but these are really minor things when considering that a smooth-running race is first order.  It's the multiplayer that actually shows the flaws in this game.  The lack of dynamic weapons and static tracks become painfully apparent as a race with friends gathers no hoots, hollers, or curses.  Exciting, thrilling, and compelling it is not.  Graphics Quantum Redshift will never be called ugly.  Blazingly fast with no slowdown, this 60fps racer runs great.  Of course, that's because there are only six racers on any track and the tracks themselves are static.  While the game is pretty, it's not hard to see why when considering what little is truly going on.  The reflective SPARCs and the gorgeous water will briefly dazzle, but the tracks themselves are kind of boring.  Yeah, they take you a lot of places, in water, over land, and very briefly in the air, but every track feels similar.  One may have snow and another desert, but otherwise they don't really vary.  There's usually one or two shortcuts on each track, but most of those shortcuts aren't terribly helpful.  The game may be attractive, but it's hardly ingenious.  The particle effects on the weapon attacks are a mixed bag.  It looks great when you're shooting away, racing on the fast track, but in the replays, with third person mode, they look pretty standard.  But then, I can forgive that since they have some pretty great water effects.  Take a dip in the pool and spots of water remain on your windshield.  As you drive, the wind actually pulls the water drops off your windshield.  A nice effect and worthy of a small ~wow.~    Sound Redshift comes with solid 5.1 Dolby Digital sound.  Though the sound effects lack variety, the sound field is vibrant with those handful of effects.  You'll even hear the crystal-like tickling of raindrops on the windshield.  The effects could have used a lot more pep and the soundtrack is a lot of generic techno pop, but at least you have the option for customizable soundtracks.  No one should make an Xbox racer without this option and it's good to see it included here. Quantum Redshift looks great and it feels like it's supposed to be great.  But for all that, it really lacks a unique style, intense gameplay, or any persuasive reason to keep playing.  While the rivalry system is good on paper, it's poorly executed and really has no affect on the overall feel of the game.  For a new game on a new console, Quantum Redshift feels dated.  Not a horrible pick-up, but really this is an incredibly standard game.  If you're itching for a Wipeout experience and you don't have a PS2, then this may be the way to go for you.", "date": "Sep 16, 2002"}
