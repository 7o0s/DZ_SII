When it was first announced that Ubi Soft would be bringing Murakumo stateside, it came as a pleasant surprise.  After all, it's a game about great big mechs chasing other great big mechs and shooting at them.  How much more Japanese can you get?  If you look up the word ~Japanese~ in the dictionary, that's the definition.  Well, that and animated tentacle rape porn.   Add in the fact that the game was developed by From Software, the people behind the superlative Armored Core series for the PS One and 2, and you've got what looks primed to be a deep, entertaining, action filled robot rumpus.   Looks can be deceiving.   I'm just going to come out and say it.  Murakumo is bad.  Really, really bad.  Borderline awful, in fact.  Why Ubi Soft decided to bring this stinker over here is completely beyond me.     The tale Murakumo tells over the course of it's 17 scenario mode missions is your standard anime fare.  You play as one of five stereotypical mech pilots who all live in a happy utopian city named, of all things, Port Oliver.  Your job as a member of the Murakumo squadron is to catch rogue robots, who occasionally decide to run amok.  Lately a lot more robots than usual have been going haywire.  Turns out your city's resident evil megacorporation is behind the shenanigans, and is trying to do some, well, evil stuff.  Surprise.  The game's story is told through a mixture of craptacular in-game dialogue (which I'll discuss more later) and FMV sequences.  The FMV's are, while nothing special, generally on par with other Xbox titles, and thus far and away the best thing in this game.    Gameplay   As far as I'm concerned, it really doesn't matter all that much if a game looks or sounds like trash (which this one most certainly does), provided the underlying game is entertaining. Murakumo's gameplay, however, is easily the worst thing about it.  Let me put it this way: Murakumo's gameplay is about as deep as a free flash-based online game.   Virtually every level of the game finds you chasing after a single robot, plane, or robot plane.  Your job is to shoot this sucka down, using your mech's two weapons.  This entail's following your enemy, and holding down the fire buttons.  Your enemy will spastically dart around the city trying to escape, theoretically causing much excitement to be had by all.  Such is not the case.   Ubi Soft has been trying to sell Murakumo as a free-roaming shooter.  This is only half true.  While you could theoretically fly anywhere in the level at any time, the game won't let you.  You see, you have to stay near your single target at all times.  If it gets too far away, which will happen within a matter of seconds if you fly in any direction other than straight towards it, the target escapes and you lose.  This wouldn't be that bad if the enemy mechs took random paths through the levels, but they don't.  Each target takes a preset sally through its level, and nothing, not even ramming your own mech into it, will deter the thing.  In effect, this makes the game about as free roaming as Super Mario Bros.   While you'll usually only be tasked with shooting down one craft, there are plenty of other non-critical bad guys that'll pop up in your path.  Except in the last few levels, these drones don't really pack enough punch to damage you, they appear to be there simply for annoyance's sake.  And annoy they do.  As far as I can tell, the only reason these things exist is to confound your ship's absolutely godawful lock-on system, which they do very, very well.      In order to have even the slightest chance of hitting something you're shooting at, a lock-on is a must.  Naturally, you're going to want to spend as much of your time locked on to your main target as possible.  The game's completely automatic, and apparently arbitrary lock-on system fails to grasp this.  It's just as likely to lock onto some mounted gun that you haven't got the slightest interest in shooting as it is to let you target the real threat.  The game will even lock onto the worthless mini-mechs when they're obviously further away than the thing you're chasing.  To make matters worse, if there are numerous things on screen, the lock will jump around from one enemy to another according to whatever stupid rules it's working with.  Couple this with the fact that big attacks from most of the mechs' secondary weapons take a second or so to fire after you've hit the button, causing you to shoot at whatever the game has capriciously targeted at that precise millisecond, and you've got a recipe for thrown controllers and smashed television sets.      That's not even Murakumo's biggest failing.  The most aggravating problem with this game is its sheer repetitiveness.  Virtually every level has you chasing one mech, either above the city, above the ocean, or through underground caverns.   At least there are a couple levels where you're chasing more than one target.  Of course, since they follow each other in a straight line, it doesn't make much of a difference to the way the level plays out.   Here's my favorite Murakumo repetitiveness story.  One of the early levels has you, surprise surprise, chasing and shooting down a plane-robot thing.  After you take off the thing's life bar, a news helicopter somehow manages to get stuck to it.  I don't know either.  Anyway, the next level has you trying to save the helicopter from the magically recharged robot. Guess how you save the helicopter?  You shoot the robot down again!  The chopper magically flies away from the fireball, and the level is complete   From Software's previous, and actually good Armored Core games were known for their high degree of customization, allowing you to build a monster of a machine that you could proudly call your own.  Can we expect the same from Murakumo?  Nope.   There is absolutely no customization in this game whatsoever.  You start out with the ability to choose from five mechs, and with the exception of a sixth that you'll earn should you be foolish enough to play all the way through this game, five mechs is what you'll end with.  Each mech has its own stereoty...I mean pilot. You know the drill: the girl pilots the agile but weak mech, the big black guy pilots the slow strong mech, and so on.  Each mech has a unique primary and secondary fire (for example, a machine gun and missiles), jets to boost forward or brake with, and that's it.  No new weapons, no improving of stats, no nothing.   Even though I've used the word over a dozen times already in this review, I find it difficult to think of the vehicles in this game as mechs.  Sure, they look like big robots and everything, but they don't do any of the things that, at least in my mind, mechs are supposed to do.  As far as I'm concerned mechs should, with a few exceptions, be able to walk.  Barring FMVs, not once in this game will your robo-feet touch the ground.  In fact, you can't even stop.  I'm serious.  This inability to hover, even though they do it in the cutscenes, means that if your robot slams into a building at the right angle, it'll just keep on trying to plow through the thing while your enemy gets away.  I also believe that a mech ought to be able to use its arms.  Other than some very limited weapon aiming, your robo-arms get no use whatsoever.  These vehicles are really more like robot shaped planes than mechs.     For those of you who actually bother to slog through this game, there's plenty of stuff to do after the main scenario mode is over.  You'll find over 25 ~expert missions~ to tinker around with, as well as an even more difficult ~trial mission.~  These levels are basically just more of the same chasing and shooting ~action,~ only even more painfully frustrating.  Any takers?   Graphics   Since I'm being so hard on this game, let's start with what works.  Generally, the menus are decent, with a nice red on white motif.  And as previously mentioned, the FMV's are passable.  Uh, the HUD displays for the various mechs are different colors, which was a nice touch, I suppose.  Hmm...what else can I say that's nice?  Well, the exhaust that comes out of your mech is very...blue.   Who am I kidding?  This could have been a Dreamcast game.  The levels, particularly the cityscapes are dull, repetitive and blocky.  I don't know how many times I smashed into what must have been the same frustratingly indestructible skyscraper, magically appearing in front of me no matter where I went.   Enemy mechs mostly appear as nothing more than dots on the horizon, covered by a big blue silhouette to let you know that that dot is the dot you're supposed to be shooting at.  When you occasionally come close enough to one to make out some detail, it becomes apparent that there's no detail to make out.  The level three enemy in particular looks like he was plucked straight from the Sega 32X's Shadow Squadron.  It's that bad.  Only the player's mech is given even the slightest hint of detail, with some decent reflection effects, moving joints and the aforementioned neat blue stuff that comes out of their feet.  Still, even these models are far below what's expected on the Xbox.      While popup isn't too bad during the outside levels, it becomes a major pain in the occasional ~fly through the tunnel~ levels.  Walls will appear so close to you that there's simply no way to avoid them in time.  The only option available is to memorize where all the turns are in advance.  Well, you could also just take the game out of your Xbox.  That might be better.      Audio   Again, I'll start with the positive.  During the FMVs, there are some genuinely nice surround sound moments, with lasers flying by and cars exploding and whatnot.  The sound effects throughout the game are pretty decent, although nothing spectacular.  I imagine it's hard to mess up the tried and true explosions, gunshots, and lasers.  Oh, and each mech's computer has a different voice, which is neat.  Finally, the game's guitar heavy soundtrack may be repetitive and a little annoying, but since that fits in with the rest of the game, I guess it's a good thing.   Now for the bad news.  Do you like to hear a robotic voice say ~The distance from the target is increasing~?   I hope so, because you'll be hearing that every five seconds or so.  Since several of the secondary weapons will cause your vehicle to lose speed, every time you shoot you're liable to hear this phrase.  The pain!   The rest of the voice actors are even worse.  Before, and often during missions, you'll be chatted up by your buddies who have something of nominal importance to say, like ~shoot down the enemy.~  These chats, accompanied by a still image with a moving mouth in the corner of your screen, are supposed to be the part where you learn to care about your teammates and so on. Instead we're treated to things like ~Oh...no.  They have...killed...her. damn...you.~  It's as if being addicted to valium were a prerequisite for piloting a giant killing machine.  This game's voice acting is some of the worst that I've ever heard.  Which is appropriate, since Murakumo is one of the worst Xbox games since Kabuki Warriors.  Look guys, I wanted to like this game too.  The fact is that it's just awful.  Awful awful awful.  It's ugly, frustrating and extremely repetitive.  Murakumo is easily the worst game on Xbox this year, and I can count the Xbox games I've enjoyed less on one hand.If you're looking for a decent mech game, you've still got options.  Either save yourself some money and pick up the now-dirt cheap, and far better Robotech: Battlecry or save up for Steel Battalion.  Sure it's four times as expensive, but it's about a thousand times more fun. Whatever you do, don't buy, rent, or even think about Murakumo.  Remember, we play these turds so you don't have to.", "date": "Mar 6, 2003"}
