If, however, you went on to explain that we'd be downright amazed at its presentation value, and actually enjoy playing despite next-generation platformers dominating our time during the holiday season, we'd fit you for a straight jacket.  Well Spyro is definitely back, and oddly enough, we are pleasantly surprised, as the game has undergone a nice rebirth on the current-gen platforms, delivering some solid gameplay, strong presentation, and an overall package that we can actually recommend this holiday.   Let's start from the beginning.  Spyro the Dragon debuted in 1998 for the original Playstation as one of many original IP's out to be the next Mario in the world of 3D.  The games were always somewhat decent, but many hardcore gamers instantly stuck them into the same camp as games like Ty the Tasmanian Tiger or the newer Kao the Kangaroo, filling shelf space as mediocre titles, rather than truly innovating and being worth serious dollars to true gamers.  It's no surprise that a redesign was in order, and we're now seeing Spyro done by a new developer, new publisher, and taken from the top in game aptly titled The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning.  The game follows the same basic premise, retains a good deal of the elements that made it unique in its design, but has definitely turned over a new leaf in both the gameplay design and execution.    The first thing we noticed when booting up the game, was that both developer Krome Studios and publisher Sierra took the license very seriously.  Not only does the game have a strong presentation style, complete with a ton of story, tons of actual 3D camerawork, and a strong initial sense of style, but Sierra actually spared no expense on giving the team tools necessary for success.  Voice acting is done by Elija Wood, David Spade, and Gary Oldman for the main three characters - something we didn't see coming in the slightest - and the entire game is scored with huge orchestral compositions.  The origins tale has nearly as much scripted story as it does actual gameplay, though the moments always seem to interrupt at the right times, as the game's pacing is pretty solid overall.     Where the game really proved itself, however, is in the general navigation and combat.  While it's still a basic action/adventure game like so many others, Spyro's combat engine is solid, allowing players to use melee attacks, pop-ups, air combos, fire combos, distance attacks, and huge supers.  Oddly enough, the game actually emulates titles like God of War, having players go into a sub-menu where each individual special attack can be upgraded (with the same layout as God of War even, obviously intended to pay honors to the game).  The general combat is slowed down for the younger audience, but it seems that every facet of the game can be paralleled to the PS2's most successful action title.  The way enemies are presented is nearly identical, having players battle a new enemy in a one-on-one situation to get them familiar with the enemy's attack patterns, and then treats them as a normal baddie from then on.  Even the colored power-ups are nearly identical, having players earn red, green, and blue gems from defeated foes that add life, fire fuel, and experience to each respective bar.  It really is an odd comparison, but the design emulation is obviously intentional, and it works.   Aside from the basics, Spyro does an overall decent job of delivering opportunities to break up the general combat, working in flight portions, training areas, and tons of different abilities to keep the action fresh.  The flight controls are as expected, having players navigate with the analog stick, speed up and slow down with the shoulder buttons, and barrel-roll and fire with face buttons.  The overall feel is decent, though it's apparent that flight areas play second stage to the main platforming, and there are still quite a few bugs and visual oddities that occur.  The game finds a ton of depth in the different dragon attacks, however, having ice, fire, earth, and electricity attacks that can each be powered up to multiple levels.  The design may be formulaic and a bit of the predictable side, but the execution is solid, making Spyro a game that we can still get behind.   Though the game is running off current-gen systems only (without the aid of progressive scan, mind you), Spyro is actually pulling off some pretty strong visuals as well.  There are some solid distortion effects happening, and battles are constantly making use of tons of explosions, bloom lighting, advanced particle effects, and some strong real-time lighting.  For a game that have that lacks the overall ~next-gen~ feel, Spyro had a solid visual design, and was shockingly impressive at times.  The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning caught us entirely by surprise.  We assumed the attempt at revitalizing the series would be purely at face value, but are pleasantly surprised to see that the franchise has gotten a serious lift in nearly every area.  The overall gameplay was extremely solid for a childrens title, the overall presentation was baffling complex  with everything from scripted story events and innovative enemy entrances  and the overall audio/graphical design is definitely stronger than we expected.  Spyro takes a ton of inspiration from classic 3D action games like God of War (its odd, but true), and for the most part it works.  We would have sped up the overall melee attacks a bit and dropped the amount of health per baddie, but aside from a few minor tweaks, the game is very rewarding.  Bottom line, Spyro is fun, and A New Beginning truly breathes new life into a franchise that  quite frankly  we didnt think deserved one.  We never thought wed be saying it, but heres hoping for a next-gen sequel.  Youve got our attention, now we want to see how far the Spyro brand can go.", "date": "Oct 19, 2006"}
