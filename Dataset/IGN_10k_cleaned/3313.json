On first glance, it looks like Him and Seek utilizes the same graphics engine and similar gameplay as Mojo Jojo A-Go-Go, but Him and Seek offers far more variety and fun than last year's shooter. Powerpuff Girls: Him and Seek is obviously a Game Boy Advance game that's aimed at the younger crowd, what with its simplistic scavenger hunt theme and basic combat action. But even so, it's definitely a good GBA title for the kids, never really patronizing the young gamers with stupid slide puzzles or Tic-Tac-Toe. The adventure may be an easy one, but it's well designed with enough variety in the gameplay to keep the gamers going until the end. Features Huge Townsville Scavenger hunt Three different minigames Cartridge save Only for Game Boy Advance  In this new Powerpuff Girls game, the three youngsters are given the task to fill a list of items during a scavenger hunt, and players must control the three girls, first one at a time then all of them together, to fulfill this task. But right from the get-go it's not a simple ~fly around the town~ job, as familiar bad guys are all over the place making it a lot more difficult for the three girls to accomplish their duties. The game itself is much like a Final Fight game for the younger crowd, as players will have to punch and blast enemies to take them out of the picture; eliminating all of the enemies in a set area will reward players with an item that's on their checklist. But it's not all just a rapid-fire battle, as certain areas require a set task to accomplish; hit the zoo and you'll have to retrieve three of the same animal and lob them all back into their cages. Head for the prison and you'll have to seek out a certain number of guards who have been bound and gagged. Accomplishing the task in a level will, naturally, give the girls one more thing they can check off on their scavenger hunt list.  The developers offer a bit more variety to this game by opening up specific, and distinctly different mini-games that, when discovered, can be played at any time from the game's main menu.Powerpuff Pinball is a  surprisingly decent, almost professionally-designed pinball mini-game with realistic ball physics. Mojo on the Go-Go is nothing more than Frogger, but it's still pretty darn challenging, even for masters of Konami's frog-hopper.  Most disappointing, though, is Boogie Frights Fever, essentially the game's Dance Dance Revolution game; its control presses aren't timed to the music, so it's more just a simple challenge of pressing the right button when it enters the guiding circle.  Other than the one mini-game, Powerpuff Girls: Him and Seek is a solidly designed Game Boy Advance game. It doesn't do much to impress on a visual scale, but that works in its favor since it's essentially mimicking the art style of the cartoon. The title utilizes a lot from the cartoon, including the audio since each character has her own voice samples used throughout the adventure. It's really quite cute to hear Bubbles or Blossom shout out ~Take that!~ or ~Pow!~ as they punch bad guys that outsize them ten to one.  Powerpuff Girls: Him and Seek is simplistic fun for the kids, and a quick romp for the average gamer. The adventure's a relatively short one, which definitely brings down the lasting appeal...but at least the mini-games can be played at any time once they've been acquired. It's got a good level of variety, and definitely puts the Powerpuff Girls license to better use than last year's old-school shooter did.", "date": "Dec 9, 2002"}
