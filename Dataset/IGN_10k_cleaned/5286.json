{"name": "Fight Club", "name_review": "Fight Club", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/11/16/fight-club-2", "text": "As fighting games go, there are the Japanese knockouts -- Virtua Fighter, Street Fighter, Tekken, and Dead Or Alive -- and then there's everything else. With the exception of Mortal Kombat (which is also debatable, depending on your preferences), fighting games are generally made best in the Land of the Rising Sun.    New developer Genuine Games' Fight Club was built with the full knowledge that to make a great fighting game, the amount of testing, honing, and polish would need to be exceptional. The team's Fight Club is disappointment on two fundamental levels: It's a Tekken-clone that doesn't come close to being as good as Tekken. And, as a game based on a movie, it tarnishes any good memory of the exceptional 1999 anti-materialist work thanks to poor presentation, sloppy story-telling, and well, missing the point.   Gameplay  Fight Club is a 3D fighting game loosely based on the movie inspired by the Chuck Palahniuk's book, but this game is neither as compelling nor as interesting. The book and movie are about fighting the capitalist core of society through the cleansing act of fighting. The game, on the other hand, is a strange convoluted attempt at re-creating this notion, but it ends up missing the point, resorting to pure fighting interspersed with poor dialog filled with profanity, and dull, lifeless characters you could care less about.    The game picks and chooses parts of the movie, including, for instance, the likenesses of several minor characters such as bar-owner Lou and big-boobed Bob, while skipping those of the main and most important characters Jack (Edward Norton) and Tyler (Brad Pitt). Jack and Tyler do appear, but they look and sound like generic polygonal puppets, resembling nothing of the actors from the movie. This would be less of an issue if the story was told with some effort, or the fighting itself was spectacular, but that's not the case.    Use well-timed counters effectively and you'll break their limbs. The fighting itself is better than its hackneyed story presents. There are several standard modes of play -- Arcade, Story, Vs. Survivor, Training, Online -- with the story being the biggest disappointment, as it creates a side narrative based on the movie, but it's told using poor story-board stills that look like drafts, and characters in cutscenes whose mouths move but no words ever arrive. As far as completeness goes, players begin with 10 characters, unlocking four additional fighters. It features an online component with two modes (on both PS2 and Xbox), one in which you're able to build your character's abilities through fights. The online fighting is solid but singular in its pursuit, that is, if you're actually interested in the game's fighting.    Fight Club provides three basic fighting styles: kung-fu, brawler and grappler. Though in the movie, almost all of the fighting was pure street fighting, this diversification seems like a sensible broadening of the movie for the purposes of re-creating a worthwhile videogame. Sadly, the three types of fighting are more like two types, street fighting and grappling. The kung-fu and brawler types feel very similar, as each is based on a quick, light fighter, the biggest difference being in the effectiveness of kicks, and delivery style. The grappler is slower in the fisticuffs department, but a more devastating wrestler, able to deliver enormous damage in long throws, pins and extended moves well after each throw.   The game is disappointing in numerous ways. For instance, you cannot look at your moves during a fight. You'll have to go to Training (which is really just sparring) to see them. The move list is organized poorly, making it difficult to know exactly what each move does, with no showing of counters, a pretty important move. You can indeed counter moves, throw, break bones, tap out, perform get-up attacks, and execute a large list of combos and basic attacks.      If you've played Tekken, several of the fighters are nearly identical to the characters from Tekken. These fighters delivery depth, and once you get beyond the game's heavy reliance on the basics, one can attain a level of mastery way past its shallow exterior. But unlike Tekken, which boasts all types of character types, personalities, stories, and distinct fighting styles, Fight Club lacks the diversity, depth, color and character of Namco's well established, well-honed franchise.    Fight Club is not without its distinct feature sets. You can break other characters' bones, rendering them without use of his arm or leg for the rest of the fight. You also can decide to tap out while online if you want to preserve your character for another fight. This is necessary because if you've broken too many bones while fighting online you'll have to retire. The Xbox version offers downloadable content (an additional fighter) and more music, but if you're already uninspired like we were, it won't matter. Additionally, you can break into different environments with specific moves, just like in Dead Or Alive.   Graphics  Fight Club is an attractive game in some ways, but it's very awkward in others. For instance, the characters all sport distinctly stretched out looks (with the exception of Bob and maybe the policeman Stern), with perfectly honed musculatures. On the Xbox, the characters are slick and shiny, with the PS2 versions being slightly muddier. The backgrounds all feature interactive parts (and some have secret levels to break into), good weather effects, moving people, and transparent walls when the camera is pushed up against them. Lens flares and heavy lighting are used well in environments such as the airport. But overall, the spare environments are unimaginative, even when they remind you of a part from the movie.    What exactly are you doing down there? The game moves at a steady high framerate and the characters are, for the most part, quick to respond. Unfortunately, the cutscenes are terribly done, the animations are repeated for numerous characters, and there appears to be only one or two losing and winning scenes. There are several cutscenes that are done so remarkably poorly, you cannot tell what's happening.    Sound  The audio is a real mixed bag. The voice acting is downright awful, with many of the characters sounding similar to the movie actors, but many just sound downright bad. Helena Bonham Carter's Marla Singer not only looks awful, she sounds terrible. Since Genuine Games didn't get the rights for the likenesses of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, Tyler's and Jack's game voices are bland and generic, making the game even less believeable.   Again, just like the visuals during the cutscenes, the audio is weak. Many times a character's mouth moves, but nothing comes out. The cutscenes are literally void of dialog, as are the fights themselves, making the game feel empty and listless.    For the most part, the music from the movie has remained the same: Most of the Dust Brothers' original music is here. However, there is weird metal thrown in here and there, and some of the songs sound like different versions or poor imitations of the originals.There are some interesting ideas in the online portion of the game, with characters that can be built up or so damaged that they can no longer play. The tactical addition of breakable bones is also interesting. If you skip all of the marring of the movie and the book with the game's awful presentation, story, production, and audio -- yes, that's asking a lot -- the fighting isn't half bad. But the game is basically a wholesale rip-off of Tekken, sans the variety of character types, styles and depth -- which, admittedly, is a lot. In retrospect, Fight Club would have been better off if it hadn't been associated with the Fight Club property at all. In that sense, it's a failure that no addition of small cult details can make up. As a fighting engine, the game's not bad, but it still needs a lot of work and a lot of tuning. As a fighter, the game has legs with some hidden depth to back it up. But I'd say that you could easily skip buying or renting this fighter and you wouldn't have missed anything at all.", "date": "Nov 16, 2004"}
