Filled with intelligent, open-ended level designs, satisfying weapons and disguises and a host of different ways to use them, not to mention a compelling storyline to boot, Hitman 2 arrives, as far as we're concerned, better late than never. Adult players will definitely enjoy the game's gritty theme and dark overtones, and those who buy their software based on how much blood spills from enemies will likely also be impressed. There's definitely a lot to do and see in Sicily. The title is marred slightly on GameCube by a questionable control scheme, a sometimes-awkward items and weapons interface, and an inconsistent framerate. But like main character Agent 47, the good far outweighs the bad.  The Facts  Direct port of Hitman 2 for PC, PS2 and Xbox Play as the mysterious 47, a genetically-engineered killing machine Pick up contracts in exotic locations around the globe Operate in a non-linear world where some objectives can be met in multiple ways Eliminate targets in either third or first-person mode Use a wide variety of weapons, disguises and gadgets to dispose of foes and gain entry to areas Choose to be stealthy or to go at enemies with guns blazing Single-player game Progressive-scan mode not supported   Gameplay GameCube owners may not recognize the franchise, but Hitman has been around. The series was born to life on the PC several years ago, and more recently a sequel followed for the format and various home consoles. Hitman 2 was well-received, earning scores of mid-eights across the board in most magazines and online sites, and this GCN version is identical to the others.   Players assume the role of ~47,~ a retired hitman who was once considered the best in his particular field. The title opens up as 47 is living peacefully in Sicily and trying to cope with some of the horrible atrocities he committed in his dark, mysterious past. Shortly after attending confession, 47 learns that his priest and mentor has been kidnapped by the mafia, and so he decides to temporarily come out of retirement to get him back. Carnage, naturally, ensues. The story, presented through a series of in-game cut-scenes, is well constructed and immediately more compelling than the videogame norm. Players will soon learn that there is more to 47 than meets the eye, and without giving too much away, there are some surprises about his background that don't follow the usual cliches.  The game jettisons players through 20 missions that span across such areas as Sicily, Japan, St. Petersburg, India and even Malaysia. The environments are wide-open and impressive, and designed so that the action unfolds refreshingly in a very non-linear manner due to reasons we'll explain below. Our hero may have several different objectives per area, but there's usually a primary goal that demands he infiltrate an area and execute a key target. He is a hitman, after all. Of course, 47 can go in with his guns drawn and bullets flying, but players can likewise choose to sneak the character onto a base and stealthily make good on his objective. Developer IO Interactive has done a brilliant job of enabling players the option to go either way without losing sight of gameplay balance. There are sometimes, in fact, several layers of different methods gamers can use to be stealthy, or to reap havoc, and that too is what makes Hitman 2 smartly different from the competition and simultaneously very entertaining at points. There are real, logical consequences for each action taken, too, which is quite an accomplishment. Agent 47 can, for instance, sneak unto a guard and pump him full of anesthesia, temporarily knocking him out. Or, he can use a wire to choke him to death. Once the guard is down, players can then steal his clothes and assume his identity. But there can be problems; first, if the guard was only injected with anesthesia, he'll wake up, discover himself half naked and immediately alert the opposition to 47's arrival, thus ruining a surprise attack. Meanwhile, if he's killed, players will have to drag his body to a quiet, deserted area and hope that he's not discovered. There will similarly be times when players will attempt to use the disguise of an enemy and, based on something they do wrong as the character, the opposition might take notice and gun them down. These elements are extremely well executed, if sometimes hard to keep under control.      Another excellent addition, which is sure to excite those looking for more replay in their games, is the inclusion of a ranking system which takes a look at how a player made it through a level and then assigns them a rank based on their performance. The system is commendably deep, too, taking into consideration elements like head-shots and stealth achievements, and for that our hat is off.  The downside to Hitman 2 is that the controls remain a bit on the clunky side, and this leads to error during frantic situations. The character is moved about with the analog sticks -- one strafes and the other aims; the precision is slightly off, so successfully targeting an enemy can be more difficult than we'd have liked, but players will definitely get the hang of it. It's easy to move about the environments and though the camera -- totally manual -- can be bothersome indoors, it works fine on the outside. Cycling between weapons and items, though, is far less forgiving. Gamers are required to hold down the B button in mid-battle and then select their item with the D-Pad, which works, but is hardly intuitive. IO Interactive has attempted to make the process less tedious by also including object-specific menus that pop up as players run over bodies, or near doors, but even these take some getting used to because gamers are first made to learn using an opposite method. There will be times, we guarantee it, where 47 will meet his end simply because players forget how to flip through his weapon system in a high-action battle. But the familiarization process will eventually end and from then on out playing the game will prove a lot easier.  Graphics Hitman 2 for GameCube has a solid visual presentation. The art style is intriguing. We really like the design of the main character and the way in which IO Interactive has dropped him -- bar code, bald head and suit -- smack-dab into the middle of Sicily without a care. He stands out, and that seems to be the point. The developer has also made good on the creation of some varied environments, from the sunset-drenched land of Sicily to the more peculiar locales in, say, Japan.   Hitman 2 on GameCube  Overall, textures are fairly detailed and clean, but there are some areas where players will be able to notice serious seaming and blur, and that's disappointing. Character construction is passable. Meanwhile, animation impressive at points and not so much at others; some of the movement appears stiff, but on the other hand when an enemy takes a shotgun blast and flies backward it looks fluid and realistic, and there are little extras like ties that blow in the wind when 47 runs, too. The game is colored with realistic lighting effects, projected shadows, water transparencies, reflections and more, but the particle system which accounts for splotches of blurred blood is something of a let down. The biggest downer as far as visuals are concerned, though, is the framerate, which stutters here and there in the GameCube version, a nuisance that supposedly wasn't in the other versions. Oh yeah, and no progressive scan mode, HDTV owners.  Sound The audio portion of Hitman 2 is excellent. The title features an original soundtrack composed by Jesper Kyd and performed by The Budapest Symphony Orchestra, and this is something that's apparent to the ears from the opening cinema. The music selection is atmospheric, sometimes voluptuous and subtle others, but it always seems to fit the occasion and scenario regardless. Quality is crisp and natural, too. Meanwhile, the sound effects are thick and realistic, from the boom of the shotgun to the high-pitched screams of unsuspecting foes. And it's all topped off by some well acted, clear dialogue that adds even more ambience to the situations; if the action is in Sicily, for example, the bad guys actually speak in Italian -- go figure, huh?I really like Hitman 2: Silent Assassin for GameCube. It's a fun, smart action shooter that features a couple of unique ideas. IO Interactive has done a great job of developing levels that really feel non-linear and if you're anything like me you're going to appreciate the logic and AI that saturates each path 47 chooses, whether it be to stealthily execute a bad guy or to run through a building while blasting enemies with a shotgun. There are rewards and consequences to doing each -- really. Also like me, I expect that some will probably wrestle with Hitman 2's unintuitive control system, which is probably one of its biggest downfalls, but anybody who takes the time to learn it well will ultimately also learn to overcome it. Still, control and the occasional framerate issue aside, this is a highly entertaining game with a lot going for it. Definitely worth picking up, especially for anybody who seeks a darker action title for their GameCube. For once, the wait has been worth it.", "date": "Jun 19, 2003"}
