Developed over a 2 1/2-year period by respected UK software house Rare (GoldenEye 007, Banjo-Kazooie), the giant game marks the next logical step for the popular DK franchise -- 3D.   The developer has, of course, spared no expense when recreating Kong and pals for the third dimension. A huge quest, intuitive controls, deep mechanics, mini-games, relentless exploration, five different characters to play with and knockout graphics. There is no doubt that Rare has delivered the goods in full. And yet, despite all of the aforementioned features, DK64 still fails to topple many of the benchmarks previously set by Banjo-Kazooie.  The Facts   4MB Expansion Pak mandatory (game will not run without it) 32MB cartridge Eight huge worlds to explore plus an over-world Tons of mini-games 4MB Expansion Pak enhanced dynamic lighting effects, depth of visibility and number of polygon characters on-screen Play as five different characters Five goals per character in each world Several four-player modes Lots of hidden secrets Rumble Pak compatible   Gameplay Big. This sums up Donkey Kong 64. The game is a traditional platformer in the sense that there is a lot of run, jump and bash action going on. But it's DK64's length that really sets it apart from any other competition in the genre. This is Rare's War and Peace, it's that simple.  After Donkey Kong's friends have been ape-napped by the evil K.Rool, it's up to him to save them from certain unpleasantness. Players begin the game as Donkey in a training sub-level, where his first basic moves are acquired. From there, it's all about exploration, picking up bananas and medals, rescuing the four other Kongs and continuing with the quest. Only when all of the characters are rescued do we really begin to understand the full scope of DK64.  The collection of items is mandatory. Bananas are scattered throughout all of the levels. They must be collected by all of the characters in order to gain access to fight bosses, which unlock new worlds to explore. Banana medals must be collected to acquire new abilities and weapons. Weapon ammo must be collected. Blueprint puzzle pieces are collected in order to complete necessary blueprints needed to successfully complete the game. There is quite a bit to stock up on.  Additionally, DK64 features a whole host of puzzles and mini-games that reward bananas to players. Most of them aren't terribly difficult -- some are downright easy. In one of the game's earlier stages, for example, players might be forced to spell out ~KONG~ with a selection of only four possible letters to choose from. Not exactly brain surgery. Other puzzles include aligning the right barrels with the flooring or matching two tiles together in a classic Concentration style. There are also switches that must be shot with guns to open doors, tiles stomped to unlock areas and bananas, so forth and so on. It all works well enough, mind you, but there isn't too much in the way of innovation afoot in Donkey Kong 64's puzzles.   The game strictly follows the Rare philosophy to extend replay value forever: players can come to an area, but they can't open it yet. They can see an area, but they can't reach it yet. They can reach a set of bananas, but the bananas are not attainable by the character they are using and remain transparent. They can see a giant rock, but can't lift it without a special ability that they do not have yet. It works a lot like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, believe it or not. What we mean by this is that the game shows players what is possible, but doesn't let them achieve any of it until they have first gained certain abilities or passed specific goals. The problem with this procedure is that while Zelda rewarded gamers for their efforts with captivating cut-scenes and satisfying new items or areas to explore, the seemingly only reward in DK64 is a new banana. This little fact may not appear to be a big deal, but it does eliminate some of the urgency of accomplishing specific tasks. ~We'll come back for that banana later,~ we might say when growing bored of a puzzle in DK64. However, had that same puzzle been challenging us in Zelda 64, we would not turn away so quickly as we would deeply want to know what might be beyond it.  Donkey Kong 64 features the best control mechanics of any platformer we've ever played. The control is platformer standard, but very deep thanks to sheer variety. Each character starts out with a basic set of moves that can be performed. As the adventure progresses, the apes gain new moves, weaponry, musical abilities and more. So, in the end, we've got five different characters with their own arsenal of moves each -- all of which must be utilized in different situations and areas for maximum success. Donkey Kong 64 is the only ape that can smash away dirt patches for five banana medals, for example. Chunky Kong is the only ape that can lift big rocks. Tiny Kong is the only one capable of shrinking in size to crawl through miniscule holes. Diddy Kong can fly. Lanky can climb up hills and float to new areas.   But there's more. Each character possesses a unique gun and musical instrument. Donkey Kong shoots coconuts and plays the congos, while Diddy shoots peanuts and plays the guitar. Thanks to Rare design, both weapons and instruments are equally important depending on location and task. Some doors can only be opened by playing Diddy's guitar, while others need Donkey Kong's coconuts. And vice versa. Now don't forget that there are five different characters, each of which feature their own instruments and weaponry.  And there's more. All of the buttons are being utilized for one move or another. There are even button combos for more moves. The analog stick moves our ape heroes, while A jumps and B shoots (unless their weapon is drawn, in which case it shoots). Z-trigger butt-stomps if players are in the air. Meanwhile, the C buttons act as the camera and R centers the view behind the backs of characters. But, pressing Z-trigger with C-up makes the apes play their music instrument. And pressing Z-trigger with C-right makes them toss explosive fruit. More, pressing Z-trigger with C-down brings up a sniper mode. And finally, pressing Z-trigger and C-left triggers a camera mode, by which players can take pictures. A camera mode, you say? Yes, just another hidden feature in the game that works to unlock even more secrets. All of these abilities serve a specific purpose, mind you, but we're not going to give everything away.  You might be waiting for us to come to the always annoying ~but...~ However, we really don't have one. Donkey Kong 64 plays as exactly as you might expect it would and perhaps that is our biggest ~but...~ of all. The game is very Banjo-Kazooie-esque in design, only much bigger. The groundbreaking gameplay innovations some might be hoping for are the only feature Donkey Kong 64 lacks. ~But,~ if you enjoyed Banjo-Kazooie -- or if you enjoy the way platformers play in general, Donkey Kong serves up the biggest helping of the style yet. No less and no more.  Multiplayer and Mini-Games It's funny how games work sometimes. The multiplayer mode in Jet Force Gemini, a third-person shooter, came up very short in the end. It was a bit on the clumsy side and the third-person view, combined with an inconsistent framerate, just didn't combine well. The end result was a shabby multiplayer experience.  Donkey Kong 64, on the other hand, features a similar deathmatch mode called Monkey Smash that enables four-players to compete against each other in no-holds-barred gun-fighting action. And it works just fine. The fluidity is consistent, the control is tight and the play environments are big and open enough that players aren't running into each other every five seconds. Gamers can control any of the characters they have unlocked in the single-player adventure. Each one is equipped with their weapon, and ammo can be found throughout the level. It's that simple, really. Simple is good. Simple is nice. We like simple.   The multiplayer mode is no GoldenEye, but for what it is -- a third-person platformer turn deathmatch -- we're quite impressed. Nice job Rare.   One of the other multiplayer modes, though, Battle Arena, isn't so great. In it, players battle with each other on a circular platform. The idea is to knock opponents off the structure with various explosions and gun blasts. This is done by walking over item pick-ups that appear as the battle wages. The mode isn't bad, but it seems more of a mini-game than anything else.  And speaking of mini-games, DK64 features quite a selection of them. There are cart rides through mine levels, there are the traditional barrel shoots (fire Donkey Kong from barrel to barrel) and there are races. And yes, there are also nods to some classics; DK64 features a very playable original Donkey Kong arcade machine in it and, a very playable Jetpac -- a Rare creation from year's past. Both are brilliantly reproduced and still just as fun as they ever were.    Graphics Our initial reaction to Donkey Kong 64's graphics was, ~Pretty. But not as pretty as Banjo-Kazooie.~ And that was definitely true enough. The game starts out, shall we say, slow -- at least in terms of visuals. DK64's central hub world, the area that is most explored during the beginning of the quest, is huge, but barren. So, we see giant, structures in the background that lack detail and a sea that stretches into a blue sky, and none of it is particularly stunning. No beautiful textures filled with rich detail like we were blown away by in Banjo-Kazooie.  But the game gradually gets better looking. A little later we come into worlds that are filled with lighting effects and colors; tunnels that glow red, green, blue and yellow with dynamic sourcing. Textures begin to look a little richer, crisper and more detailed. We rescue a new character and utilize him. The animation is amazing. Lots of personality -- much more so than any other Rare title. Perhaps this is best represented in the character selection screen. Chunky Kong, the biggest and baddest of all the apes, cowers when he is called upon by the player, suggesting that Tiny Kong do the work instead. It's funny.   Next, the particle effects are introduced, a desert wind blows around us and looks beautiful. We come into dark hallways illuminated by rotating colors (dynamic lighting, incidentally, is often overused in this game). The game is coming together now and it looks beautiful.  And yet, despite usage of the 4MB Expansion Pak, DK64 still, in the end, isn't quite as visually stunning as Banjo-Kazooie before it, which is a bit baffling to us. We exit amazing looking areas into a gully of water that looks just plain bad compared to the transparent, clear, magnificent lakes in Banjo-Kazooie. Texture design never quite equals the near flawless backgrounds of Rare's previous 3D platformer.   Additionally, DK64 has a bit of slowdown now and again. Nothing to worry about, but it's there all the same. We can attribute this to the fact that the game's levels are larger, more characters are on-screen and, of course, we've got all of those lighting effects to worry about. But, Banjo-Kazooie didn't have 4MBs extra and it managed. How come Donkey struggles now and again?  In the end, DK64 is still a beautiful game all the same. By industry standards, it's simply amazing looking. By Rare standards, though, we were hoping for a bit more. Donkey Kong 64 is not the Donkey Kong Country of the Nintendo 64, if that's what you were hoping for. It's Banjo-Kazooie with lighting effects, and sometimes not as pretty.  Sound DK64's 32MB cart is packed full of sound samples and music. The game's opening sequence demonstrates this fact quite nicely with some of the worst music and ~rap~ ever to grace a videogame. If you sit through it once, give yourself a pat on the back -- you've done well. If you sit through it twice, you may want to seek professional help as you're obviously not right.   Once the game kicks into action and there's no Donkey Kong rap involved, however, the listening experience is mostly enjoyable, and sometimes downright funny. Unlike most Rare games of this nature, the main characters do not annoy you or baffle you (see Twelve Tales: Conker 64); they've got personality and they're humorous. Kong eats flies. That makes us very happy. And he also growls, grunts, and says ~banana!~ a lot. This also makes us very happy. Every character in the game features similarly humorous sound samples, be it squeaking giant-sized rats or other Kongs. Even Tiny, which we were sure would make us teeter on suicide, isn't so bad.   The music, while not as dynamic and clever as Banjo-Kazooie, is still well composed and moody. Each environment carries with it a different listening tone, and it all sounds great. Rare definitely has some of the best musicians in the industry, there is no doubt about it. Well, Donkey Kong 64 has finally hit home and I think the wait has definitely been worth it. The game, while not the leap and bound that Donkey Kong Country was for Super NES, is still an excellent platformer all the same. It's an epic, gargantuan, huge, giant-sized platformer. It's a game that is packed full of things to do. There is so much that it's often overwhelming. The game is every great platformer combined into one package. And that, more than anything else, is what separates it from the competition.I've said DK64's graphics aren't as impressive as those in Banjo-Kazooie, but don't be mislead by that -- the game is still a visual stunner. It's one of Nintendo 64's prettiest games to date. Awesome lighting and particle effects, detailed textures with loads of color, lots of variation and the environments are downright huge. Admittedly, the lighting effects may be a bit overused at times, but these are features that some developers aren't even capable of pulling off without ruining the gaming experience. The framerate, mind you, does suffer at times, but it's never too bad and it certainly doesn't have a bearing on gameplay.In the end, Donkey Kong 64 feels more like a super-sized version of Banjo-Kazooie than it does anything else. And while that should be a great, great thing, it's bound to disappoint a lot of Nintendo 64 owners who had built the title up as the Second Coming.Buy it.", "date": "Nov 25, 1999"}
