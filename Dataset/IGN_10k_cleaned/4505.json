Struggling to place a coin on the crowded marquee, trying to make sure you did indeed have ~next game?~ Well, neither do we, but had this game actually put an appearance in at our local Aladdin's Castle, we're fairly certain those things described above would have happened.  Features:  Obscure classic game Yet infinitely playable  Admittedly, this is the first we have heard Ninja Tower, even though the copyright on the title screen dates back to the Reagan Era. But it certainly plays like a refugee from the eighties. The goal is simple - you, as a little ninja, must jump to the top of multi-tiered towers, offing pudgy black-clad ninjas with your unlimited bag of shurikens.  Yes, that's all there is to Ninja Tower, which is exactly why it succeeds marvelously in making us wish we had played the game much, much sooner. The game is a seemingly endless affair of tower jumping and pointy-object throwing, the hallmarks of any good, classic arcade experience.  Control is quite simple. You jump, you press up. This launches you into the air, where hopefully, you'll find footing on the next platform. Too bad the next ledge is usually host to evil ninjas that often return the shurikens you throw their way. When you find yourself on the dangerous end of a shuriken, you can either press down to drop back to the previously platform, or deflect the blade with a shuriken of your own.  Most ninjas that you deflate leave behind goodies, like scrolls, that are worth bonus points. And as soon as you reach the top of one tower, there seems to be another awaiting your ascent seconds later.  But the amount of time you play Ninja Tower will indeed be greater than a few seconds. The game, in all of its delirious simplicity, is a pain to put down. The towers are never too tall that you'll just turn the game off in frustration - when a goal is dangled in front of you like that, you answer the call.  Bright and cheery, Ninja Tower certainly looks the part of 80s arcade misfit. These ninjas are hardly the sleek, stealthy breed you find in Ninja Gaiden or Shinobi. Instead, they looked like they gorged on a few too many dangos to fit in their suits. Ninja Tower also keeps things moving with a pleasant little ditty that endlessly loops in the background. Just because Ninja Tower isnt a brand name doesnt mean you should pass it by. Its a charming, simple game that supplied me with quite a bit of fun on more than one slow afternoon. Hopefully, Caves efforts at resurrecting this forgotten (or never-heard-of) gem will see greatsuccess. As much as I like Tetris and Tom Clancy-games, smaller efforts deserve recognition, too.", "date": "Feb 29, 2004"}
