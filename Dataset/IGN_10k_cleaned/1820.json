Ducati World Racing Challenge is one such title, and I am afraid that, despite the fact that it had occasion moments of fun, the game was, on the whole, not unlike falling off the face of a cliff.  Often choppy, undeniably uneven, occasionally gruesome, and certainly something one would avoid if they had the slightest bit of intelligence.  Hell, even stupid people have some sense of self-preservation, but apparently not the individuals who unleashed this bit of digital villainy on the gaming public, because this is the sort of thing that incites violence.  Actually, thinking rationally, it's not really like falling off a cliff.  It's worse.  I say this primarily because they don't charge you $39.99 to take a flying leap. Yes, kiddies, it is that bad.  Ducati is reminiscent of a bad  1st gen PlayStation game in so many ways that I almost feel violated that a game like this has managed to sneak onto my Dreamcast, especially when things are already at a less than promising state.  I'm sure you're all wondering why at this point. Allow me to attempt to explain as best I know how. But like one who is in a room full of doors, there are just so many things to knock that don't quite know where to begin.  First off, the game's engine is just broken. There is constant pop-up, viciously obvious texture swapping, and the game can't even seem to draw solid lines near the edge of the track.  The lighting is terrible, and the models are simply awful. It basically looks just like the less-than-desirable PSX version of the game. Not quite the awe-inspiring power of the Dreamcast, here, people.  The control is extremely disappointing as well.  It is really touchy, as slamming on the stick will fail to move your bike at all in one movement, then slam you into multiple walls the next.  On top of this problem, the track does some messed up things to your bike.  For some reason, riding up the side of a wall is no problem on some occasions, but just when you think you're getting comfortable with this complete lack of realism, it throws you to the ground for barely bumping a boundary.  My favorite bit of inconsistency, however, is when you will just wreck for no reason whatsoever.  Apparently, some are a result of bumps in the road, but the engine is so poor, you get no real sense of perspective or terrain discrepancies, so you're basically flying blind a good 90% of the time. This is especially annoying when engaging in the game's license tests, as you are often required to make sudden moves based on the track, which you can't really evaluate on the fly unless you have played it a good deal more than any reasonable human would. Ducati is obviously trying to mix some aspects of simulation and arcade racing, however, it manages to fail on both fronts in a big, big way.  The game offers over 40 bikes, tons of stuff to unlock, and 2-player multi-player, but very early on in my experience with this title, I knew that they just weren't worth my while.  Even the audio is lackluster, and much like the fun in Ducati, is often completely absent.  The bland techno tracks that pace the game are not exactly chart-toppers, and the sound effects are basically non-existent.  The bikes make hardly any noise, and even when you go thrashing into the pavement, you'd swear you were wearing a full body silencer. There are no well-tuned engines, no adrenaline-pumping tunes, and no thunderous crashes. Much like the rest of this game, the sound checks in with a resounding whimper.  In light of all these short-comings, Ducati World Racing Challenge is a far cry from what a next-generation experience should be. Truth be told, it barely does a good job of faithfully replicating the PlayStation experience, which wasn't that great to start with. I guess if the guys at bleem! are completely desperate, this poorly conceived emulator might be a good start, but outside that. This thing is a real banana in  the tailpipe of Dreamcast racing.  Stay far, far away...it may be contagious. -- Brandon Justice, IGNDC", "date": "Mar 6, 2001"}
