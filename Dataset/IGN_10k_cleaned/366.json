{"name": "Mortal Kombat Trilogy", "name_review": "Mortal Kombat Trilogy", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/12/20/mortal-kombat-trilogy", "text": "It seems like every year, Midway releases a new version of their classic Mortal Kombat game. Normally adding just enough characters and moves to warrant an upgrade, each version seems only to build upon the faults of the original and sometimes even manages to add a few. Luckily there are exceptions, and Mortal Kombat Trilogy is one of them.  A compilation of all the characters and backgrounds from the previous games, MK Trilogy is easily one of the largest fighting games currently available for the PlayStation. Thirty Two characters are playable from the start, with at least 5 hidden ones thrown in for good measure. Midway has even gone one better, and included a few new characters to master, such as the bosses Shao Kahn and Motaro.  The Playstation version is pretty much arcade perfect. Some frames of animation have been left out, changing the timing of some of the combos, but after a little practice it doesn't seem to be a problem. Amazingly, all the special moves are intact, with even some new ones, such as Baraka's spin blade, added to better balance the game.  The gameplay is almost exactly the same as Mortal Kombat 3, with only two major changes. An agressor gauge has been added which increases with every attack you do. When filled up, your character's special moves become more powerful, taking off even more damage. A new finishing move has also been added. Called Brutalities, they are Killer Instinct style combos which end with your character uppercuting your opponent, causing him to explode. While these new features are inventive, they add little improvement to the depth of the game.  All in all, Mortal Kombat Trilogy is a solid fighter with enough new options and secrets to keep even the most avid of fans busy. It may not be the most respected fighting game due to the lack of depth or innovation, but with the small number of quality fighters available on the Playstation, it does fill a nice void. Granted, if you have never liked Mortal Kombat, then this game won't change your views. But if you are a fan then you're sure to enjoy it.", "date": "Dec 20, 1996"}
