We couldn't get into it because of the whole language barrier and the mediocre reviews from the Japanese press didn't have us that excited. Maybe this was a good thing for the game as the lower expectations might be at least partly responsible for the fact that I've thoroughly enjoyed playing through this very unique game from Sony.   Gameplay  It's really hard to nail down the genre of Dark Cloud or to explain to someone exactly what type of game it is. The reality of the whole thing is that Sony's RPG is really a compilation of several elements of many different games. The game's creators, whether by chance or direct design, have in effect stolen elements from a lot of different great titles from year's gone by and put them together in a single game.   There's definitely an influence from Nintendo's Zelda franchise, as can be seen by the game's main character, the lock-on battles, and some of its dungeon and artistic design. Players will also see some of Vagrant Story here, as the game relies heavily on the ability to find new weapons to power-up and build according to the desires of the gamer. The random dungeon elements have been seen in hordes of games before it like Diablo II and countless other games. And while I can't comment on it directly as I have regretfully never played it, a lot of people have related the world-building elements in Dark Cloud to Act Raiser on the Super NES.   Using all of these elements, the creators of Dark Cloud have successfully crafted a highly-enjoyable and insanely addictive role-playing experience that wouldn't have been able to stand alone with just its story, just its battle system, or any single one of its gameplay elements. The game works because each element aids in the enjoyment of the other parts.   The player is put in the role of young boy named Toan who is chosen by the Fairy King (ha, ha) to help revive the world after it had been destroyed by the recently summoned ~Dark Genie~ or ~Black Demon.~ You see, as the world was being annihilated by the Genie, the Fairy King managed to save buildings and people by storing them in these magical spheres called ~atla.~ And it's Toan's job to find these pieces to restore each town he comes across using the magical gem that he was given called the ~atlamillia.~    To collect the atla to put his own town and others in the world back together, Toan must journey into a variety of 15-plus level dungeon featuring randomly generated layouts and items. While one won't ever confuse the battle engine or cave designs in Dark Cloud to what you'll find in the Zelda games, they serve a different purpose here. The dungeons in the game are best thought of as a simple means to an end. You venture through these dungeons to collect items, find the pieces to rebuild the town, find new and cool weapons and upgrade your characters and their equipment.   Even though this might not seem that fun to some people, and understandably so, if you're the type of gamer, like myself, that likes to waste time in RPGs doing things like leveling up like crazy or managing your weapons in great detail like in Vagrant Story, this can be a very addictive aspect of the game. There's also a nice mix of locales that you'll come across in Dark Cloud beyond just the first, almost stereotypical, dungeon. Toan's adventures will bring him to dungeons in environments like a shipwreck, a desert palace, a forest, and other out-of-this-world surroundings.    The battle system seems like a direct rip of Ocarina of Time, but a bit dumbed down for the sake of simplicity. The lock-on targeting system actually works amazingly well and offers very few annoying camera angle or control problems, but just doesn't have much to it. In the early going, things get mighty repetitive and monotonous quickly, as battles with Toan are limited to him dodging and swinging his sword, but gets remedied a bit as you progress through the adventure.   Once you start making your way through the quest, Toan begins to make friends (allies of Toan that can be switched to at any time in a dungeon once they're a part of your team) that want to help restore the world and destroy the Dark Genie. Each of these different allies offers different skills that come into play in the battles and keep things fresh. There's a character that is slower, yet offers some extra power with his hammer-based weapons, another casts spells, this cat-like girl uses a slingshot and is the only one that has the ability to jump over holes (not realtime, but press button and she jumps), and another uses a long-range staff weapon and the last makes use of these modern, gun-type weapons.   Additionally, specific characters are needed to get past certain parts of some levels and, for boss encounters, it's actually required for you to switch between two or more characters to defeat it. Even though all these different characters basically gives you the same basic abilities of a powered-up Link near the end of a Zelda game, it works out well here in Dark Cloud.   My only real problem with the battles and the whole weapon power-up and management system that goes along with it is that weapons can break and are immediately lost when they do. Weapons also break down much too quickly and one is often required to repair weapons a half-dozen or more times during a single level of a dungeon. This can be painfully annoying if you happen to break a weapon that you've essentially spent the entire game powering up.   Even though this is your own fault, it doesn't make it any less irritating when you simple forget how close your weapon is to breaking and unleash a combo on an enemy that breaks the weapon on the final hit. The weapon, the items you've placed on it, and all of your work just instantly disappears and you're back to ground zero with another weapon. This happened to me about 75% through the game and almost infuriated me to the point of quitting right then and there (my last save was about an hour prior to this, so just resetting wasn't an option to me). It's something that can be managed by keeping a good eye on the weapon hit point meter and saving often, but the game would be better suited if a completely damaged weapon just stopped doing damage instead of completely disappearing into thin air.    There's also a special dual mode, which happens only a handful of times throughout the game in either one-on-one battles or cut scenes, that is a odd mix of Dragon's Lair and Parappa the Rapper. When one of these starts, the player must accurately time the button and or directional pad movement to coincide with what's being shown on screen. If successful, Toan makes it past the event -- either killing the enemy or getting past the danger -- and if not, the player must simply try again.   What's more, even if you don't like straight dungeon hacks, Dark Cloud might still be a game worth checking into. The dungeon crawl elements are broken up really nicely, as after each and every level in a dungeon you can go back to the town and use the items and pieces that you have collected to build the town and further along the storyline of the game.    The town building aspect is quite as robust as I would've liked, but it still gives you a lot of freedom to place houses where you wish. The general order that you get the stuff seems somewhat linear and with each house you basically follow the same routine -- fill pieces that you can, talk to the person in the house to find out what other parts need to be filled, then fill those in -- but there's still a sense of creation and freedom. The inhabitants will also give you suggestions on where they want to live, such as next to a body of water or near a specific person, but you're not required to listen to them, even though it's in your best interest to follow their wishes.   And just as the dungeon crawl elements benefit you by giving you stuff for the world building aspect, putting together these towns reward you by giving you more of the story and even some special items in some cases. As you complete each particular house, an Event will be triggered that enables you to walk into the house in question and get a little in-game cut-scene that'll open up more of the story to you. And whilst, the story isn't comparable to what you'll get in an epic like Final Fantasy or Chrono Cross, it does become much more than just an excuse for the world-building elements, which it seems like in just the beginning.   You're not getting some brilliantly written masterful tale here, but the story is good enough to keep you wanting to find out more, and that's really what's most important in a game of this kind. The dialog is a bit dry on the whole, but elements such as the Pumpkin Panty Fortune Telling and the occasional modern humor will surely make you chuckle.   Dark Cloud is also a very long adventure. If you're looking to blast through it and not worry about all the extra stuff, it's conceivable that you'll be able to finish it in around 30 hours on the game clock. But, if you're that type of gamer, then you'll probably not enjoy playing this game in the first place. If you like collecting items and weapons and tinkering with the building of the different towns and want to play through every inch of the game, including the extra levels that have been added by SCEA for the game's American release.   Graphics  If Dark Cloud would've launched with the PlayStation 2 in the United States, the game's visuals would have been received much better. But as it stands now, there are a lot of better looking games on the system right now and we've seen some amazing looking titles that'll be available in the not so distant future.    Even still, Dark Cloud isn't a bad-looking game by any means. The character models actually look really good, completely with jag-free edges, lots of texture detail and really cool designs. There are also some really huge and tremendously boss characters that give Ganon from Zelda Ocarina of Time a run for largest bosses in a console adventure game.   What hurts Dark Cloud is its background graphics. There's a lot of flickering in the backgrounds, plus clipping problems can be found, there are some instances where you'll see seams in the textures (the sparkly white lines), and the background textures are poorly designed in that they look like floor and wall tiles in the outside environments.   Nonetheless, the visuals in the game don't really detract from its appeal. The characters look great, so you don't lose any of the attachment with them and its graphical flaws don't impact on the gameplay in anyway. There's never a drop in framerate and the only reason for complaining is that it's part of the job and we've seen so much better in PlayStation 2 in games like Ico and Jak and Daxter.    Sound  The music in Dark Cloud reminds me a lot of the early town music in Chrono Cross. All of the tunes have a similar, light-hearted and cheerful tone to them and is extremely soothing on the ears and mind. The music is beautiful and the only problem that I found with it is that there's not enough variety in the tracks. You're stuck playing through more than 15 levels for each of the game's different dungeons, so with only one track for each, most of the songs get old rather quickly.   Luckily, none of the songs are grating on the nerves or bad, or else this would have been an even bigger problem. Still, it would've been nice to have a nicer mix of songs in the dungeons and a better diversity in the way the music sounds from level to level.   Outside of the background music, there's very little here to really comment on. The basic moving around and hitting sound effects are all here, but nothing's really worth mentioning. There aren't any character voices, which could've helped enhance the storyline, but at least nobody is going to have any problem with the voice acting, since there isn't any (except for the orgasmic sound when you heal a player by walking into the water in dungeons).Maybe it was because I was going into it with low expectations because of the modest hype it received after its import release, but Dark Cloud has turned out to be one of this year's biggest surprises for me. As has been suggested throughout this review, the whole of the game is definitely much greater than its parts. If you go out and look, you'll be able to find other games out there with better randomly created dungeons. The game's story doesn't reach the epic scale of Square's Final Fantasy VII or Chrono Cross. Zelda's realtime battles are much more advanced than what you'll find here in Dark Cloud and the game's weapon and item management system pales in comparison to Vagrant Story. Furthermore, if you're looking for a game where you can create worlds, you'll find much deeper stuff on the PC. What Dark Cloud offers is a splendid mix of several existing genres and game ideas that when merged together brings forth a delightful and extremely addictive adventure role-playing game that's easily one of the best we've yet seen on PlayStation 2. But is it for all fans of role-playing games? No. If you're one of those people that found the weapon management and building in Vagrant Story to be a bit overdone or find leveling up in traditional role-playing games to be a pain without a true reward, then you'll likely be turned off by Dark Cloud. However, if you're like me and enjoy things like leveling up characters, finding lots of secret items and weapons, and managing a world that you have the ability to layout, then Dark Cloud is definitely your cup of tea.", "date": "May 30, 2001"}
