Of course, it's also filled almost to bursting with tons of shovelware crap (just look at the PS one lineup six or so years post-launch), and oddly enough CSI: 3 Dimensions of Murder ends up landing somewhere in between those two polar extremes.   On the one hand, it's a game that probably never would have seen the light of day if not for the fact that the PS2 is still going strong and carries with it the biggest install base in the history of home consoles. Development is cheap and ports are likely even cheaper, which at least partially explains why we're seeing a port of a point-and-click PC game a year and a half later. Ubisoft stuffed their C (or is it D? E?) Team with the port (for those curious, that'd be Ubisoft Bulgaria) with minimal actual effort in transferring a mouse-driven interface to one controlled by a game pad.   The result is a solid -- even at times genuinely great -- whodunit pixel hunt that harkens back to the glory days of PC adventure games. Yeah, sure, the gameplay is a whole lot of running back and forth between locations (punctuated by some fairly beefy load times to boot), talking to people and scouring the sparse, barely-interactive set pieces for interactive points.    Sometimes, these are just false leads -- which prompt your straight-from-the-TV show partner to commend you for being thorough but don't actually offer any info -- but there are at least a couple interest points somewhere in a particular area. By drilling into these, you can bust out a handful of forensic tools for lifting prints and collecting fluids which can be analyzed at the lab or with a mobile analysis vehicle. The challenge, then, is to link the disparate swabs o' blood and digit deposits into a chain of evidence that eventually links the murder victim to one of the two main suspects in the case.    The Trinity, they call it, and it gives you a basic visual display of the breadcrumbs you're following to eventually find the killer. Original developer Telltale Games did a great job of littering the cases with twists just like an episode of the TV show, but in the end it boils down to hunting for hotpoints in the scenery and grilling people until neither cough up any info. Sure, there's some deduction that can be made, but the logic leaps (and trademark whooshing recreations of ~the act~) are usually pretty well-orchestrated from the start.     So long as you like following a breadcrumb trail or are struck with a bit of nostalgia at the very mention of the bygone days of PC adventure games, then you're probably going to enjoy the six cases presented on the disc. If you haven't the stomach for slowly bumping your way through what look like circa 1999 environments, staring at low-res, stretched textures in the hunt for a cursor change, then you're not going to lose any sleep over not having played 3DoM.   Unfortunately, even if you do like pixel hunts (and I do, obviously, which is why the game is getting a decent score in the first place), you're going to have to put up with some absolutely horrid presentation. The menus themselves are decent enough, but in addition to the aforementioned load times that crop up whenever you move from one location to the next, you'll also have to deal with apparently motion-captured suspects that quiver like a crackhead detoxing, insanely stiff animation (when there even is some), piss-poor textures and some of the lamest models you'll ever see on the PS2 (outside of the characters from the show, which are decent approximations).     Speaking of the TV cast, most return to reprise their roles in the digital adventure, and though they all sound a little too bored to really be interesting, I'm sure for superfans of the show, they'll get a kick out of having familiar faces as partners -- even if it means they're just there to offer the odd comment. The sound-alikes for those that didn't opt to lay down some lines for the game are plenty good, and the new characters for the game are at times quite a bit better than anyone from the show, particularly because the dialogue as a whole is quite solid.    Easily the best part of the audio is the music, though. Moody, atmospheric, and even a little somber at times, it's usually little more than a couple light percussive loops and some long held notes, but when you hear the same tracks looped over and over again for hours on end, it's a testament to the composers that they don't grate. Hell, in the case of the music that plays in the lab, the almost morose tune got stuck in my head.   I mentioned Ubi putting one of their backup teams on the port, and it shows. Beyond the constantly stuttering framerate and the incessant load times, there are some nagging little things that cropped up. In one instance, the voiceover for the tutorial stated the complete opposite direction to do a task, I caught a misspelling of Patrick (~Partick~) and in the most glaring oversight there was actually a reference to clicking an options button at the bottom of the screen. Granted, you can kinda click with a controller, but there's definitely no options button at the bottom of the screen.   It's an obvious holdover from the PC version and just shows the general lack of attention to detail in bringing the game over. I actually had the game crash on me, too, wiping out a good three hours of progress in a single frozen screen. Granted, I could have saved at some point, but you're only penalized when you ask for help from your partner so unless the game suddenly turned into CSI: Vegas Zombie Outbreak, there's really no reason to save unless you're turning off the system for a while.   3DoM, if you look beyond the crap-tastic presentation, the ancient visuals and the archaic gameplay, is really a rather engaging experience. No, it's certainly nothing new, nor does it do anything exemplary, but as a solid, old-school adventure/murder mystery, it satiates those looking to fill their Holmes jones.", "date": "Oct 23, 2007"}
