Games get redone, repackaged and shipped out again with a new numeral stuck on the box, little progress having been made to the design or appeal of the actual product inside. It seems like it happens all the time  but it hasn't happened here. Unexpectedly, surprisingly, and pleasantly, Petz: Catz 2 has arrived on the DS as a product quite a bit improved over its predecessor. This is a game that's managed to break away from the sequel curse, and has made significant strides in providing a more playable and engaging game experience than the first Catz offered. Sequels can be exasperating, but Catz 2 isn't that kind of sequel.   It's actually fairly fun, which is more than could be said for the first DS Catz, which seemed unfocused and meandering. But Catz 2 introduces a ribbon system that gives the game direction. It's a goal system, simple but effective in offering you a path to progress, but also allowing you the freedom to just play with your pet if you like.   The ribbons are awarded frequently, in a way not dissimilar to the Achievements you might earn while playing an Xbox 360 game. Succeed in feeding your cat for the first time and you get a ribbon. Give it its first bowl of water, you get another ribbon. Clean its litter box, play with it by throwing a ping pong ball, take a picture of it sleeping  ribbon, ribbon, and ribbon.    You can choose to ignore the ribbon graphic when it appears, continuing to go about your business caring for your cat. But if you tap it with the stylus, you're taken to the Ribbonz menu and given a look at further goals to go for  like a progressive tutorial, earning each one teaches you how to play the game more and more.   Though not available right away, you can eventually unlock special breeds like lions and tigers.  And earning each one slowly unlocks more and more of the game's features, ultimately culminating in three special cat breeds. At the very beginning, you're given a fair variety of different kinds of cats to choose from, including common American housecats, Siamese, Maine Coon and more. But complete some of the ~achievement trees~ the Ribbonz menu presents and you'll be able to also raise baby lion, tiger and cheetah cubs. Exotic.   It seems a simple, even dismissible feature, but in execution the goals offered by Catz 2's Ribbonz system help to give the entire experience a structure and direction that the first Catz lacked. And with a solid structure in place, it's easier to have fun in a virtual pet title.   Petz: Catz 2 also introduces a Playroom feature. Like a training ground for cats being put through boot camp, it's there that you can get your feline friend to grow stronger, more agile and more intelligent over time by encouraging it to climb up walls and leap across gaps. In the beginning, your pet will only be a little bit mobile, and unable to venture very far very fast. But over time, as its stats increase, it will be quicker on its feet and more active overall, making it more fun to continue to play with  again, this is structure and progress, and it helps frame the experience even more.   One of the issues addressed in reviewing the first Catz game on DS was its visuals and camera system, which was difficult to deal with and always seemed to bounce back to the cat even when you wanted to look around and scope out the rest of the room. The camera hasn't been perfected in Catz 2, as it still wants to center itself on kitty whenever it can, but it's not as egregious an issue any more. There's a bit more freedom in moving the viewpoint around, and icons have been added to help when playing with toys like ping pong balls  you can simply tap an icon in the upper-right corner of the touch screen to have the ball ~summoned~ back to your hand if you lose sight of it in the living room. It's a nice touch.And it's only one of many nice touches, which add up on the whole to a much-improved virtual pet experience. Petz: Catz 2 make a lot of little improvements in a lot of different areas, each of them addressing issues that caused concern in the first Catz game on DS. And, additionally, it smartly adds in the Ribbonz system that unobtrusively offers structure and direction to the entire product. Taken together, all of the upgrades make Petz: Catz 2 a much more compelling product than the first Catz was, and while the design will need to continue to innovate to raise its level even higher and ultimately compete with designs like Nintendo's Nintendogs, this is a sequel that's made significant strides in the right direction.", "date": "Dec 6, 2007"}
