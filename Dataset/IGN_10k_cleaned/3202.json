Not too surprising. But then nor should it be. Spearhead is, after all, the awaited and currently debated expansion pack to what was one of the first and still best action games of 2002.  Allied Assault had a knack for thrusting gamers headlong into the most brutal and devastating war of our time, all the while keeping them cherishing nearly each and every single moment of it. But there were instances that were less than enjoyable -- situations that were so frustrating they broke keyboards, destroyed mice, ruined careers and even soured steamy relationships. At least that was her excuse.   Spearhead largely does away with these troubles and instead tries to focus on the parts of Medal of Honor that gamers most fondly remember. Epic assaults, impending doom, urgency, immediacy, a sense of being overwhelmed, and camaraderie are all here. A small group of roughnecks, BARs in hand, will win the day.  These better aspects of the entirely stellar Allied Assault have all been focused on for Spearhead. However, when the main course of boiled potatoes and meatloaf is cut out and supplanted with three helpings of the creme brulee the dinner becomes neither lasting nor filling. As a result, Spearhead's length suffers. Yup, it's about three hours of gratification.   War is this time played out in front of the eyes of Jack Barnes, a personality devoid hero extraordinaire capable of doing anything and everything. He also happens to be the greatest nemesis Nazi Germany has ever faced. Zombies? The Plague? A volcano that shoots out lava and Godzilla who's throwing clumps of lava? None of them can touch Jack. As our boy Barnes, gamers will decimate the ranks of Germany's feeble but stylish army by manning about two dozen weapons, anti-aircraft, moveable turrets, and even a tank with top mounted machinegun.  It starts with a bang and then falls off from there, literally. Jumping out of a plane with half a dozen or more other troops and then watching whatever plan there was explode in your face alongside bursting flak, flaming planes and falling bodies is plain awesome. Machinegun nests light up your buddies. Men without chutes plummet to their deaths. Search lights scan the skies for clumps of victims.   Superb sound that still has few rivals in today's marketplace pulls it together. Know now that the polish of every word, whisper, ricochet, and explosion from Allied Assault has been faithfully recreated here. In case you haven't played Medal of Honor in a while, I recommend setting the quality to high and then cranking the speaker volume to levels that would kill lesser men -- truly exhilarating stuff.   Incredibly loud and chaotic action sequences are spliced together masterfully with quiet, but gunfire riddled sorties. Total immersion is the end result. The game transitions seamlessly from a loud and impacting battle to one where only a few fires in the dark can be heard, yet they brilliantly manage to carry an even more profound effect than the chaos.   Same awesome sound. Same awesome dialog. A lot of these men actually sound like war heroes, and those who don't sound like soldiers caught up in something they don't want any part of. It's unfortunate then that like Allied Assault, Spearhead is more of a loosely connected jumble of missions than anything. There is no character development, bonding, worrying, or empathy of any kind.     But then I doubt anyone will give much of a damn when six Germans come pouring out of a small cottage. Ample scripting makes Spearhead sing the same captivating tune as its older brother, which sounds something like ka-boom, ka-clang, ka-boom, zing, ra-ta-tat-tat.   There's a tremendous sense of urgency and uneasiness inherent with each of the missions. Fostered by pacing and a rapid but logical change of scenery (from an airdrop to inside a barn, to a pleasant countryside, to a hill with a tank, for instance), it all manages to mesh, fit, and work. For the whole three hours it lasts, anyway. The problem is that there just isn't enough of the sweet. Since the game is by nature linear (if you think you can walk there, you probably can't), the limited amount of linearity is quite...limiting, stupidly enough.      It doesn't help that Spearhead seems to suffer from even worse performance issues than Medal of Honor did before it, at least in singleplayer and heavy multiplayer bouts. GeForce 3's married to 1GHz Athlons and dating 384MB of RAM on the side still suffer from some serious and horribly debilitating, inconsistent and downright unplayable framerates. At one point during play on such a test system (well kempt, mind you), I became so enraged by the performance that I actually turned every single setting down to the bare bones minimum and played knowing that it would at last remain smooth, which it didn't. Then my left arm spontaneously combusted. It seems stress hits me in waves.      But for that huge downside, Spearhead picks up a solid upside. The AI hasn't been mutated into half man, half hawk monstrosities this time around. Last time I walked away from Medal of Honor it was in cuffs because I was delusional enough to think I could play through the singleplayer campaign on hard and not get caught in the chin constantly by the eagle-eyed sniper, ever fixed onto my position from the very moment I entered the level.   The ignorant Nazis seem appreciably stupider here. They're not as keenly aware of Jack's presence and exact position as they once were. It's now very likely that you'll be encountering the actual backs of foes, which makes those squad-based melees all the more enjoyable. With their attention diverted, it's entirely possible to stumble upon a flock of Nazis and savagely kill the whole dang lot of them. Flock, school, pack, whatever.  Funny, for Medal of Honor to be rated Teen by the ESRB, like it is, there cannot be any blood. It's naturally still cool to shoot a dude in the throat and take giddy pleasure from his death gurgles and the way he clasps his hands around his neck as he slowly topples over onto the floor dying. Interesting. I guess it's only good here because the scene is depicted tastefully. Sure, the models are so detailed, vivid, and well animated that shooting them actually has impact and alters their facial expressions, but they don't bleed, so who cares? Stupid ratings.  Graphically Spearhead is identical to Allied Assault, except that there seems to be an awful lot more happening on screen at any given time. More soldiers running one way, more decorative scripted sequences happening in another, and things of this nature.  I must say, shooting a poor man in the neck would only be so much fun for so long if it had to be done with the same weapons as before, so EA LA has added a bunch more to the mix. Some of the new weapons don't seem to be as well modeled as those from the original. It's the Goldeneye effect. A game has a lot of guns that aren't too different from on another, but then nor do they need to be. The expanded arsenal adds, a lot. Picking up something different and using that just because it's there, however functionally similar to another weapon it may or may not be, is still an excellent way to go about things. Diversity is the spice of life. Don't expect radical changes and design differences, because there aren't any. No one then had an automatic shotgun, or an OICW. Each weapon (squeeze and something on the long end of the loud stick dies) comes with a distinct feel and some slight differences, some more loved than others, but that's where it rightly ends.   It's just like the added gun butting and pistol whipping. You're still going to prefer to shoot a man, regardless of range, but that doesn't mean the addition is worth a complaint. Frankly I rarely use the new singleplayer lean function or gun club, but I'll not contest their inclusion as they only help add an extra, admittedly small level of completeness to the total package.  It probably took you longer to read the above than it will for you to win the game. What to do now? Check out multiplayer. If you're a fan of Allied Assault's, whether it be hosting or playing, you're going to be in heaven here. Even though only 12 new maps have been added to the mix, there also comes a new mode, the tug of war, which is somewhat analogous to a round of Battlefield conquest, only the permanent spawn bases are destructible, thus cutting off any chance for reinforcements if they go up in smoke.   What did you think of Spearhead?  What's more exciting, and at the same duller, is the new multiplayer system and the seemingly improved net code. The expansion, you see, is not only a box with new content, but an excellent kind of pricey patch that smoothes over certain aspects of the original game and generally polishes up its fenders. Still, it can't ever hope to compete with something of Battlefield's scope, even if it is moving at a brisker pace.  Despite all that's been added here, there's still a lot missing. More modes, more models, multiple teamed games, the occasional vehicle or two, more maps in different modes. Spearhead's straightforward, no frills, drop a man into the action and force him to shoot his way out of the flaming thicket before the end of lunch approach to gaming will be appreciated by some, but deplored by others.There's no denying that like Allied Assault, this expansion amazingly delivers as authentic a WWII singleplayer experience as any action title can. But, its sheer brevity makes it a fleeting indulgence -- a change in scenery with exactly the same everything else. Spit and polish gussy up some areas, but bafflingly high demands on a gamer's big rig tarnish others.True Medal of Honor fans will relish the improved multiplayer and expanded arsenal, but will find the exciting singleplayer campaign (I use the word campaign loosely) to be but a small ripple in the greater sea of games. Only this ripple just happens to be filled with pretty things to see for the whole three hours it lasts.Quick and cool, Spearhead warrants a look if not only because of its heritage, than because of its precise, believable, and immersing delivery.", "date": "Nov 14, 2002"}
