Known primarily for reliable, but somewhat staid 3D RPGs and the famous Armored Core mecha simulation series, it's the last house you'd expect to produce a game about weird cartoon rodent-things with flowerpots and umbrellas growing out of their heads.  However, that is exactly what From Software has done with The Adventures of Cookie and Cream (known in Japan as Kuri Kuri Mix).  Who thought up this game?  It smacks of some sort of catharsis, a bunch of poor bastards locked in the bowels of From's coding sweatshops breaking completely all of a sudden, after marathon weeks of designing Core parts and testing the levels in Eternal Ring (~There's a bad polygon seam in the third cavern.~ ~Where?~ ~Hell if I know, can't tell one bloody tunnel from the next in this game...~).  All of a sudden, lightning struck their canned-coffee-addled brains and they said ~YES!  WE MUST MAKE A GAME STARRING A RABBIT WITH A FLOWERPOT ON ITS HEAD!~  Luckily, that spirit of innovation survived after the initial moment of state twenty-six.  Cookie and Cream is one of those games that may not be for all, but which some will latch onto in a puzzling frenzy.    Gameplay  Cookie and Cream may look like a platformer, but it's not, strictly speaking -- it's also a puzzle game, although it certainly includes an awful lot of platforming elements.  An analogous collision of genres would be Twinkle Star Sprites (which maybe, say, two of the people reading this review have played).  In the same way Twinkle Star crashed vertical shooting into Puyo-style combative puzzle games, Cookie and Cream combines basic platforming into a cooperative puzzle-fest.   You view the playfield from the top down, while Cookie and Cream proceed in parallel up vertical tracks.  As they progress, each encounters barriers, which they have to cooperate to solve -- one has to open a door for the other, rotate a platform, move a drawbridge, break through a wall, and so on and so on.  Every level is a race against time, so while cooperating to move forward, you also have to grab clock power-ups and dodge threats that sap your time.  The tricky bit is that, depending on how you play the game, you may be using one controller to move the two characters.  Solo, you use one analog stick and set of shoulder buttons to move each character.  There's a multiplayer setting that uses the same configuration, though -- two people hold one Dual Shock.  It sounds clumsy, and that it is, but that's part of the fun, especially when you work your way through into the later levels and encounter some really tough puzzles and time limits.  Playing with two people also makes the boss encounters much easier.  Controlling two characters on your own through the regular linear levels isn't so hard, but the unusual strategies you need to use to battle the bosses are more easily executed by two.  The game's difficulty ramps up well, starting with relatively simple puzzles and progressing smoothly into later worlds.  More complex cooperative puzzles and platforming challenges pop up as you go farther, and working together becomes more and more important -- one character can't just sit and wait for the other as much as they do in the first levels.  Graphics  Puzzle games are generally immune to graphical complaints.  If the gameplay concept works, the game works, and looks be damned.  Cookie and Cream, however, has a pretty nifty graphical style to go along with the original concept.  It's not a technically overwhelming game, but it's solid in its cartoony way, in high resolution with a perfect framerate.  The characters and backgrounds work as a 3D realization of the iconic character art, and manage to include some pretty entertaining visual gags now and again to boot -- the load screens are an absolute riot sometimes.  Sound  It's the first PS2 game with banjo music!  And the first PS2 game with maracas, I guess, although Samba de Amigo sorta made maracas in videogames old hat...  At any rate, Cookie and Cream has a soundtrack to match its oddball visuals, especially in Music World, one of the second levels you can work through (once you beat the first world, it opens up more than one, so you don't necessarily have to go through the game one way).  Invariably adding an accent to the music in any level are C&C themselves, whose bizarre chirpy Japanese interjections are more fun than any other sound effect could be. There are obviously those of you out there who wouldn't be interested in this game.  I don't like you and I certainly don't understand you, but I know who you are.The rest of you are advised at the very least to rent this game -- even if you don't want to own it for all time, it's one of those things that you ought to experience for a little while, just to say you've done it.  Reflect, after all, that in a sane world there is absolutely no reason at all that this game would ever come to America, and certainly not without a complete makeover and stupid American characters thrown in to replace the MEGA-BOSS rabbits with flowerpots and banjos.Flowerpots.
