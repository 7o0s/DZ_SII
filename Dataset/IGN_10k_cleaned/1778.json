But probably the best reason why we buy certain games is because we want to keep playing over and over again  replay value.  We want to get the most out of our 20  40 dollars we spend on a game because over time, the visual jewels fail to sparkle and the once golden game playability loses its luster, and we're left with the question ~is there anything more in this game?~  That said, Charge'N Blast is such a game that contains solid visuals and cool gameplay features, but the lack of replay value seriously hurts the game.  Based on the SEGA arcade game that never made an appearance in the US, the story is the standard ~save the world from nasty monsters~ theme that we've come to expect in these types of shooter/action games.  As part of an elite trio of soldiers, you can select from three different characters, each with their own abilities and weapons.  Again, we have the standard cast of characters: the all-around type, the faster, sleeker female character in red, and the mammoth, tank-like, strong guy.  Once you've selected a soldier, you blast off into areas infested with monsters, and proceed to lay down the law with some heavy weaponry.  If the game wins any points, it comes in the cool gameplay mechanics.  Using the Analog pad to aim, each character has three different types of ammunition for attack.  Each type of attack is more or less effective depending on the area and type of enemy you're encountering: if there's a swarm of aerial enemies, homing weapons would work best while in the depths of the ocean, torpedoes are the tools of the trade.  However, you can't just fire and forget; first, you have to select the type of attack and press the corresponding button.  Once this is done, you can fire it right away by pressing A (default controls), or you can ~charge~ the attack to increase the damage.  And if you're worried about getting hit by enemy attacks while charging, that's where the useful strafe feature comes in.  Using the L and R buttons to dodge left and right, the game becomes literally a ~blast~ because you're incorporating every button into a fast, furious shooting spree.  So, what about looks?  While the game is a bit old from its initial arcade outing, Charge'N Blast doesn't slack in the visual department.  There's still that nagging slowdown when tons of enemies and firepower are onscreen and the way enemies ~dissipate~ when they get blown up is kind weird, but the designs of your characters are pretty keen, and the enemies are nicely varied.  Boss characters come in some serious size, and you'll face a gargantuan lizard beast that would give Godzilla a run for its money.  The frame rate and animations displayed are okay, though the problem with slowdown does occur quite frequently.  So we have cool play mechanics and pretty good visuals and now comes the one huge problem with the game  replay value.  The game is definitely short and once you get the control down, this game is pretty easy.  And there's no reward at the end after beating the game, so there's really nothing to look forward to if you want to play through the game again.  There's one extra mode, Time Attack, where you have a limited amount of time to get through each level  yeah, I know... whoopee.  Arcade ports like Crazy Taxi and Virtua Tennis onto the Dreamcast included excellent bonus modes to give even more longevity to the game.  With only a measly Time Attack mode, Charge'N Blast is a direct arcade port, lacking any modes or bonus features that make the gamer come back after finishing the game.  While this makes Charge'N Blast an excellent rental for a night or two, the lack of gameplay longevity makes Charge'N Blast go out with a ~dud~ rather than a bang.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Feb 9, 2001"}
