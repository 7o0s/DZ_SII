Purr Pals is sponsored by Purina, and you're sure to know it  the pet care giant known for Puppy Chow, Fancy Feast and the ~dogs don't know it's not bacon~ Beggin' Strips brand has managed to get its name and logo placed strategically throughout this new virtual pet experience from Crave. It's a wise move, because the frequency of feeding required in this digital cat design ensures top screen time for Purina's product placements. Kittens are needy creatures.    And according to Purr Pals, kittens are starving creatures too. The need to feed is one of a few persistent annoyances in the Purr Pals design  but none of them are quite annoying enough to dismiss the game altogether. It's really a pretty solid virtual pet experience.    The adventure of animal ownership begins with adoption, and your choice of 40 different breeds of cat to choose from. It's a robust array of options, and the choices continue after the initial breed selection  you're further allowed to customize the eyes, whiskers, gender and coat pattern of your kitten before giving it a name and taking it home.    Once there, the game opens up into a casually-paced play experience that's more detailed and involved than first glance would suggest. Basic interactions with your pet become available, from petting, grooming and playing to cleaning out its litter box.    Petting is the simplest, as the stylus and touch screen simulate patting your kitten on the head and scratching behind its ears. Little heart icons emanate from the animal all the while to represent its appreciation for your affection.    Grooming is similarly controlled, as you drag a brush across your cat's fur to clean its coat. This activity is timed, though, and it's possible to fail by not being quick enough with the comb.    Litter box cleaning is like a rub-the-screen take on Whac-A-Mole, targeting clumps of kitty's ~special presents~ with quick scrubs of the stylus.       All of the above are necessary cat care activities, and each of them will require frequent repetition in order to keep your kitten happy and healthy. But none of these need to be done, and done again, and again, as often as feeding.    Shaking open boxes of Purina's finest Friskies fills your kitty's dinner dish, and keeps its hunger meter at bay. The hunger meter is one of four  there are grooming, love and play meters too  and having a perfectly happy cat means keeping each one of the four in the green. All pretty common for the genre. The problem, then, is that the food meter refills towards the bad, red end much too quickly. Even just ten minutes after serving your cat some lunch, a look at its hunger status will show it's already halfway back to famished.    It's like you've adopted Garfield. Your hungry, hungry hippo of a pet will demand ceaseless offerings of Purina product, and it's nearly futile to try to keep up with the demands of its bottomless stomach. I actually saw the hunger meter increase again, toward the negative end, while my cat was eating.    Assuming you ultimately just ignore the kitten's basic needs, you'll find there's much more fun to be had elsewhere  like in the mini-games. Purr Pals offers four. Alley Oop is a stylus-controlled game of hoops, shooting a ball into a basket in your home's backyard. Cupid is an archery contest, firing arrows at flying hearts above two lovebird cats sitting on a fence. Copy Cat is a knock-off of classic remember-the-pattern game Simon, and Music is a touch screen clone of DDR or Guitar Hero. Each of these games earns you money for successful play. (And Music is easily the best. Makes you wonder what a real portable take on Guitar Hero would be like.)    Cash can be invested in any number of extraneous accessories, like hats, collars and sunglasses for dressing up your kitten, along with other odds and ends like new decor for your home. This feature is actually a lot of fun, fueled by the great variety of items on offer  you can equip your pet with everything from a chef's cap to a long-feathered pimp's hat and watch it strut around the room.    You can show off your costume creations, too, if you find another friend with a Purr Pals game card  multi-card two-player support is included, though limited. Purr Pals was planned for play over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection at one time, but this feature got the axe in this final retail release. It's a shame  maybe someone else across the Internet would have fed this little guy for me.All around, Purr Pals is not a bad virtual pet game at all. It's home to lots of little details, some fun, unique activities, it looks good and the level of interactivity with your cat is solid. There's one last reason the title can't score higher than it does, though, and it's not the too-frequent need to feed mentioned above  it's game-ending crashes. Purr Pals will sometimes freeze up on you, and get locked on a solid white screen that can't be escaped. You have to turn the power off to your DS to fix it. If developer Brain Toys can revisit this design, clean up the bugs, make the cats less needy and implement some of the lost features  like Nintendo Wi-Fi support  then Purr Pals would stand to be an excellent choice for virtual pet fans with the dual-screened system. As it is now, it's just a fair one.", "date": "Jun 12, 2007"}
