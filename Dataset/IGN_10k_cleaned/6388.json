Obviously taking the view that spelling errors and adding a 'Z' to the end makes something extreme, Melbourne House brings another mediocre combat racer to the already overcrowded PC market.  So what's the story behind Dethkarz?  Well, it seems that the most popular sport 200 years in the future is ultra-violent rocketcar racing.  Much to the enjoyment of television viewers around the world, races are held in four exotic locations, three on earth (Metro City, the South Pole, and the Grand Keys) and one on Mars.  The suspended tracks are riddled with powerful weapons which racers can use to demolish their competition.  Wow ... even the premise sounds predictable.  OK, I realize that I may sound a little jaded up until this point, but I've seen way too many racing games which follow the exact same pattern ... they really show off the graphical end, but they usually fail when it comes to control and variation.  Sure, there's tons of eye candy in Dethkarz, but the game just seems like a rehash of Megarace or Wipeout, offering nothing new to the combat racing game market.  It's the lack of descent control that really makes Dethkarz just another average racer.  The cars themselves feel very light and airy on the track, making them skid and spin out of control way too often.  This is especially dangerous since the tracks are elevated above the terrain, making steering mistakes doubly painful.  It's easy enough to control the Astor, but the superfast F1 styled Anassi is almost impossible to keep on the track.  Trust me ... you'll be seeing a lot of air (and water and buildings and cliff walls) as you fly out of control off of the tracks.  Even the secret car (which you think would be a blessing) is a pain to drive, unable to corner well even at slower speeds.  This is particularly frustrating because the tracks themselves are extremely narrow, making tight cornering even more difficult.  Another major drawback to Dethkarz is the lack of variation, both in tracks and cars.  Although the back of the box suggests that there are 12 different cars, there are actually only four basic car body styles: the reliable Astor, the behemoth Blitzwagon, the flexible Hyperon, and the zippy Anassi.  There are three slight variations of each but, when you figure in the increasing difficulty of compeititors as you progress through the game, the cars really handle very similarly making the different body styles almost indistinguishable in control.  And, although there are 3 different track lengths (short, medium, and long), the same four backgrounds get extremely boring after only a few games.  The track design in Dethkarz is also extremely deficient, often punishing race leaders for doing too good.  For instance, on one jump in the Grand Keys track you'll hit a billboard if you're going too fast.  This will totally stop your car, letting your opponents pass you.  Arrrggghhh!!!  Wait a second ... I thought the point of racing games was to go as fast as possible.  There's nothing more frustrating than being at the front of the pack only to hit a billboard and watch everyone pass you.  As I said earlier, one area where Dethkarz really does shine is in the graphics department.  The cars look amazing, complete with highly polished candy-like shells which reflect clouds and other cars.  The lighting effects from the weapons are also some of the best I've ever seen in a racer and it's evident that the design team really focused a lot of time and energy into the graphics engine.  Unfortunately, games can't survive on graphics alone and, ultimately, Dethkarz just doesn't make the cut.  Except for the laser guns and power-ups, Dethkarz is just like all the other arcade racers that have been released recently. It's a decent racing game, but it's not as good as Need for Speed 3, Test Drive 5, or Ultim@te Race Pro.  In the end, Dethkarz just comes across as too generic and bland ... a beauty with no brains.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Dec 19, 1998"}
