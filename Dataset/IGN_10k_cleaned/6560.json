DChoc's War Hero 1944 is just such a game, which has no console World War II shooter to rely on for support, nor a movie to give it an extra marketing boost. It stands on its own merits, and fortunately, they are pretty solid merits.   War Hero 1944 is obviously built on the engine that powers developer Sumea's Mafia Wars series. It's a good, strong engine and it works well in this budding franchise, too. The isometrics look solid and it gives the designer plenty of opportunities to add extra detail to otherwise two-dimensional sprites, such as jackbooted Storm Troopers. In fact, the art style is War Hero 1944 is very evocative of the era -- even more so than Gameloft's Brothers in Arms.   However, the isometric view is not without its caveats. Controlling isometric games is a tricky ordeal, but War Hero 1944 helps the cause with an auto-target feature that simplifies things when the action gets a little hairy.   War Hero 1944 is fueled by a decent little yarn about a soldier named Carter that is shot down behind enemy lines. Of course, Carter ends up being in the entirely right place at the right time, because it sets in motion a series of events that allow him to take on practically the entire Nazi army. Fortunately, Carter is not alone in his endeavors.   That's both a reference to supporting characters and his arsenal. War Hero 1944 grants the use of plenty of bang-bang, such as a rifle, machinegun and some grenades that produce very satisfying explosions. (Although, I wish there were a few more weapon options.) The need for bigger and more effective weapons is apparent in the waves of German troopers that invade the screen. At first, you're only dealing with cannon fodder. But before long, the Nazis are sending their finest SS to bring you to your knees.   In addition to the main story mode, which spans fourteen missions and offers different goals (such as rescuing POWs), War Hero 1944 includes an all-out action mode called Defend the Fortress where you turn back a seemingly inexhaustible supply of Nazis.  War Hero 1944 is a pretty solid WW2-themed game, featuring some good graphics and non-stop action. The level of detail in both the sprites and environments is to be commended, too. The isometrical view, though, does occasionally make for troublesome controls, and when you have things blowing up all over the screen, you don't want to have to worry about mobility. If you liked Mafia Wars I or II, or just enjoy blowing the hell out of Nazis, War Hero 1944 might be worth a look.", "date": "Jan 17, 2006"}
