One of its most successful ventures has been Luxor -- which, to be fair, is very similar to PopCap's Zuma, which in turn is very very similar to a 1998 arcade game called Puzz Loop.  So Luxor isn't terrible original, but it is playing off a proven formula.  Puzzle fans could do a lot worse than this marble-shooting game.   The object of Luxor is to prevent an onslaught of spheres from reaching your pyramid.  In control of a winged scarab, you accomplish this goal by shooting your own spheres into the single-file line and matching colors of at least three.  Where it differs from Zuma and Puzz Loop is that your scarab is situated at the bottom of the screen and you fire up, rather than from the center of the playing field.   There are quite a few power-ups to help you achieve your objective and these appear much more furiously than in Zuma.  You've got your Reverse Motion to send the spheres moving backwards and your Slow Motion, but there are also things like a Scorpion that races out of the pyramid to destroy spheres, the Color Bomb that eliminates globes of its matching hue, and a Lightning Bolt that turns anything in its past to dust.  As you create combos and clear large groups of spheres, power-ups will fly out of the explosions and you'll have to catch them in order to put them to use.   Along with power-ups, some form of currency is dropped when you clear enough orbs.  This leads to unlocking Blessings that can be mixed and matched to give you a permanent boost in battle.  There are 13 Blessings but you can only have three equipped at a time, resulting in one of the game's only sources of strategy.   No bathing actually occurs in-game. Players can choose to play with the stylus or just use the D-pad and buttons.  While the stylus is faster and can be more accurate, it's too easy to accidentally shoot the wrong color from your reserve.  To use the reserve you slide the stylus down and to the side of your scarab and touch the back-up, but all-too-often you'll end up doing this when you don't mean to.  For my money, it's better to just stick with the non-touch controls.   What's really obnoxious about the control scheme is that, while you can play levels with either the stylus or button control, you can't hit the ~OK~ button and progress to the next level with any button.  You have to tap it with the stylus.  So if you find you'd rather play with the D-pad, you have to keep the stylus in hand anyway.   Speaking of money, Luxor costs way too much of it.  While it only costs $20 on PC and PlayStation 2, for some reason this version is set at $30.  There are cheaper puzzle games on the DS that offer more bang for your buck.  Here we have an Adventure Mode, Endless Mode, and Practice.  There is nothing to unlock, no multiplayer, and only 88 levels (not an incredible amount for a puzzle game).  Magnetica, the DS version of Puzz Loop, included single-cart multiplayer modes.   Visually, Luxor does just fine.  As the spheres roll in and you start making combos you'll get quite a large number of objects flying around the screen.  Explosions are flashy and there is a nice amount of detail to each level.  The music is proficient, but you won't be humming any of the tunes when you set your DS down.There is a reason Luxor is on its second sequel over at Mumbo Jumbo's website.  This is a proven gameplay formula and Luxor tweaks it just barely enough to stand on its own.  The problem here is that the DS version offers less value than the cheaper, downloadable originals.  If you're a fan of puzzle games, you'll enjoy this challenge for the fleeting moments it lasts.  But the DS market is too crowded for developers to be phoning in these ports.", "date": "Feb 14, 2008"}
