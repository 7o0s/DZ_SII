There is lite fare like US Air Force and Advanced Tactical Fighters, middleweight contenders like World War II Fighters and Fleet Command, and top-of-the-line not-for-the-faint-of-heart-or-short-of-attention-span works of genius like F-15 and the Longbow titles.    Jane's latest, F/A-18, is in this latter category.  It doesn't quite displace Longbow 2 as the finest thing with the Jane's label on it, but it fits snugly into second place behind that legendary helicopter sim.  F/A-18 is a complex and cerebral sim from the development studio in Baltimore that gave us Jane's F-15.  The similarities are readily apparent in terms of style, technology, and gameplay.  But everything's been taken up a notch or two and the end result is the most solid and comprehensive contemporary jet sim since, well, F-15.  Among flight sim fans, you can't avoid comparisons to other titles, which can be a helpful way to pinpoint any given sims' accomplishments.  ~How does F/A-18 compare to Falcon 4.0?~ simmers might ask.  Falcon's vaunted fully dynamic campaign has undergone a solid year of patching, which is a long time to beta test a sim that should have been finished before it was put on the shelves.  I can't speak to its current condition, but even eight months after its release, Falcon 4.0 still had a loopy Alice in Wonderland quality to its campaign: anything could, and did, happen.  But Jane's F/A-18 doesn't attempt a fully dynamic campaign; instead, it's more limited ambition gives it the personality and stability lacking in Falcon 4.0.  The F/A-18 campaign is a set of branching structures with management of assets like ordnance, airframes, and pilots.  The campaign follows NATO intercession in a Russian civil war, set in the frozen seas and mountains of the North Cape.  There's a nice Cold War feel to NATO taking on the Russian Communists in their own territory that we haven't seen since Microprose's Fleet Defender.  ~How does it compare to Flanker 2.0?~ they also might ask.  Flanker is an excellent sim sadly lacking some important elements that make a good game: a set of compelling playable missions, a sense of being a part of a wider operation, and wingman interaction.  While F/A-18 is an excellent sim, it is also a great game, brimming with the missing elements that made Flanker 2.0 so sterile.  The campaign (and the single missions, for that matter) ramps up slowly to create a sense of being sucked into the action rather than having to bang your head against it.  The skies are crowded and positively chatty with interaction among your wingmen, your carrier, your AWACS, and even your escorts.    ~How does it compare to MiG Alley?~ devoted simmers might then ask, inviting comparison to the finest sim of 1999.  Well, apples and oranges.  MiG Alley is a visceral toe-to-toe rough-and-tumble exercise in yanking-and-banking on the cusp of controlled flight.  But F/A-18 is a detailed, yet accessible recreation of contemporary military avionics.  It's all in your head and at your fingertips.  It's about using your sensors, processing information, and putting sophisticated systems to work to deliver sophisticated weapons.  This is probably F/A-18's greatest strength.  Unlike any other sim, it has captured a sense of the awe-inspiring collection of technology packed into modern combat aircraft.  Not only are there detailed radar and infrared modes (de rigueur in any modern jet sim), but there is an astonishing amount of information available, from fuel calculations to a BIT (built-in test) display that gives a complete rundown of the status of all systems.  For instance, you can spot an oil pressure failure and shut down an engine to prevent a fire.  The Horizontal Situation Display, a standard tool for navigation, and the Situational Awareness display, a way to keep track of threats, are both comprehensive and extremely useful.  However, once you've turned off the air labels that effectively place a neon sign over every aircraft within a certain range (a set of sensory training wheels, if you will), there is no magic eye.  Radar is sensitive and realistic, so you'll have to rely on AWACS and wingman contacts to see the big picture.  Then there are the toys in all their glory.  Many sims offer fancy weaponry, but us hard-core simmers take so much for granted.  If you've seen one Continuously Computed Impact Point, you've seen them all.  That's why the special modes distinctive to certain weapons and aircraft make such an impression.  Ask any longtime simmer the most enjoyable way to deliver a Mk84 iron bomb in Digital Integration's ancient Tornado sim, and he'll describe something called Loft Mode.  On the other end of the simplicity spectrum, ask a casual simmer what's the best thing about Novalogic's latest F-22 sim and he'll probably tell you about the tactical nukes.  But F/A-18 has numerous toys modeled in memorable or distinctive ways that I've never seen in another sim: small decoy airplanes launched from the Hornet's underbelly, electronic decoys towed on a wire behind the jet, fully programmable Harpoon anti-ship missiles, basic heat seeking missiles rudimentary enough to lock onto ground fires, AIM-7 Sparrows that are actually useful, a rocket-boosted laser guided bomb, and a Self-Protect mode for anti-radar missiles that automatically pops up a launch cue if a threat locks onto you.  Of course, all the usual suspects are here as well: laser guided bombs, rockets, air-to-air missiles, Mavericks, cluster bombs, and then some.  The manual is largely adequate for the areas it does cover, but there are gaps big enough to float an aircraft carrier through.  This is bad enough for more seasoned simmers, but it's particularly a disservice to the newcomers that might have enjoyed learning this dense sim.  Most of the weapons and systems are described in general terms, with a listing of what each submode or function does but there's rarely any explanation of why you'd want to do something.  For example, you can set the height at which a cluster bomb splits into its component bomblets.  This would probably be a very useful feature if Jane's were to give us some information on how to best use it.  Instead, the manual appears to have been written for hard-core jet jocks who just want to know where the buttons are and who don't need to be bothered with an explanation of what they do or why they should be used.  The most egregious example of this approach is in the communications.  The skies of Jane's F/A-18 are alive with radio chatter, all conveying useful information.  There are detailed menus of communications options you can use to interact with all this activity.  And there is exactly zero information in the manual on this.  Zip.  Zilch.  Nada.  ~Ducks away.~  ~Mother's weather.~  ~Popup single.~  ~Requesting alpha.~  ~Sweet and sweet.~  You'll hear all this.  And it's all important.  Too bad there's no way to find out what it means.  One perceived weakness of this sim is its engine, which is based on the technology behind F-15.  I say ~perceived~, because like any hardened flight simmer, I don't mind turning down the detail to get a smooth framerate.  But Jane's F/A-18 is packed with features like volumetric explosions and a 3D cockpit that can choke any processor.  Even then, it's not a particularly gorgeous sim (although it's got a lovely thunderstorm effect and some mighty fancy dynamic lighting effects).  But it shows what it needs to show with enough flair that I find myself mucking around with the external views to get a good look at the action.  Also, the developers carried over one of F-15's most annoying features.  Once you've achieved your mission goals, a dialogue box instantly pops up, pausing the game and asking if you'd like to end your mission.  If you accept, the mission is over, your aircraft is preserved intact, and your pilot's stats are updated.  All good and well.  But let's say you've suffered a fuel leak and you're flying on fumes, there are SAMs inbound, a flight of Su-27s has cut off your egress, and you're plumb out of chaff.  The exact instant your bomb hits its target, you can just hit that little button to accept the end of the mission, and you're home free.  It also undermines the excellent carrier landing routine built into F/A-18.  While many new gamers might appreciate the option to skip that boring ~fly home and land~ stuff, the rest of us know that's the most crucial part of the mission after your primary objective.  Jane's may as well put a ~God Mode~ button in the cockpit.    Finally, no review of F/A-18 would be complete without mentioning the outstanding post-release support from the development team in general and the game's lead designer, Chris (C.J.) Martin, in particular.  Mr. Martin has been tirelessly rubbing elbows on the public forums of Usenet and various message boards, offering everything from technical support to background information to friendly banter.  It's a rare and wonderful thing these days to see a developer standing proudly before his product, front and center, patiently addressing everyone from the newbie who's still running DirectX 5.0 to the grognard speculating that the model for the GBU-16 is a few centimeters too long to the retired Navy vet who just wants to swap stories.  Take a guy like Mr. Martin, give him a development team like those boys in Baltimore, and you'll end up with the finest perspective on modern jet combat short of enlisting.  -- Tom Chick", "date": "Feb 4, 2000"}
