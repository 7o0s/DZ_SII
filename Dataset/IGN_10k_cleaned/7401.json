Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/19/lumines-live-review", "text": "This review of Lumines Live! almost didn't get written in time for the nightly publish and not just for the normal reason of being too engrossed in a good game to want to  start writing. Instead, it was because this editor had to fight off hordes of co-workers who refused to stop playing Lumines Live! long enough to give me a chance to see how its trip to the Live Arcade went. Then came the arguments over the way Lumines Live! is being sold over the Marketplace and how, if at all,  that should affect the score. To say Lumines Live! is addictive is putting it simply, but we still can't get over the fact that we've just paid for a game and its not all there.    Lumines first appeared in the United States as a launch title for the PSP. The hypnotic puzzle game with soothing sounds instantly became one of the must-have titles for the new handheld. The gameplay in Lumines is simple enough. Drop blocks made up of four dual colored squares down onto the playing field. Make a square out of one of the two colors and wait for the constantly sweeping line to erase it from the playing field. Making the square grow by adding more similarly colored blocks into a square shape around it before the original square gets wiped off nets you bonus points. As usual, if the playing field gets filled and you can't drop a block down, you lose. It's easy to get into but tough to put down, thanks in large part to the skins. These skins are unlocked as you move through the challenge mode and provide new backgrounds and songs, which also change the rate at which pieces fall and are cleared from the screen. It may sound like a generic puzzle game, but once you play it you'll see just how much fun it is.   A lot has changed in the travel from the handheld world to Xbox Live Arcade. Some of these changes are for the good, but others will frustrate and anger some who drop the 1200 Microsoft points ($15 USD) for the ~Base~ pack. There isn't a whole lot of information up on the Live Arcade telling you what you're getting for your 15 bones and the Base pack isn't the complete Lumines as many fans know it. The complete game still isn't up on Live Arcade as you'll be required to pay for additional downloads to get everything. There are a bunch of new additions in their place, making for a whole list of ways this version of Lumines is better than the original, yet still unsatisfying in certain places.    The Puzzle Mode has been mostly removed and now only the first five of 40 puzzles are available. The remaining 35 become available when the Puzzle/Mission pack is purchased, though it wasn't available at launch, and you can clearly see what you're not getting as it is grayed out on the menu screen. Although a Mission Mode has been added, where you are tasked with clearing certain sets of blocks in a small number of moves, you also only get to play the first five missions before you have to pay more money to keep going. The huge variety of skins in the PSP game was also taken out of the Base pack. There are just 12 skins available, many are different in appearance from their PSP counterparts. More skins and songs will be available in the future by purchasing additional packs. But that wasn't even the most frustrating thing that we saw. The VS CPU mode that was present in the original Lumines appears to be in the game, but it isn't. After you beat the first stage of the supposed 10 round tournament, the game informs you that you have to pay more for the rest. That flat out sucks. The only feeling that can possibly compared to is paying for a shareware game and then being told you have to pay more for the complete version. Nowhere on the menu does it tell you that you won't be able to play the full tournament.    Without the Puzzle Mode and skins, this may seem more like Lumines light than Lumines Live! That is until you take a look at what has been added. The obvious additions of Achievements and Leaderboards are there, but that is just scratching the surface. Lumines Live! has multiplayer online or locally for two players. There is also a new Skin Edit mode where you can select which order you progress through skins that you've unlocked in the normal challenge mode. For each of the modes you also get an evaluation on your playing performance which can be viewed through the option screen.  You'll want to watch that evaluation screen more than you would have in the past, thanks to the fact that you can now go above one million points, something you couldn't do on the PSP. You can even save what you've just done in a new Replay Theater.   Loading times, which were quite annoying on the PSP especially on the shorter game modes, are almost nonexistent on Lumines Live! It's a tradeoff though, since the portability is obviously now gone.     The Achievements, which mostly deal with Time Attack mode, are laid out in a great way to actually encourage practice and reward those with skill. The first few are entirely obtainable with only moderate skill, though it may take a bit of practice before the beginners can get all of them. There is a second level though, clearing 70 blocks in 60 seconds for instance, which are going to take serious talent to obtain.   Lumines Live! is still a great game at its heart and those who haven't played it yet should definitely check it out. The 12 skins are not nearly enough for those who have invested a lot of time in the game before, but new or weak players probably won't even notice the difference as they struggle to last the requisite 20 minutes to half  hour it requires to unlock all of them.    Clearly, a lot has been added, but the way this game is presented just makes you constantly feel like you're getting bled for more money. The game costs 15 dollars and exactly what you do and do not get for that cost is deliberately vague. In the end, it severely hampers the experience as you go through the game and slowly realize what you aren't actually allowed to play. We wouldn't be so sore if we knew exactly what we were getting and what extra packs would cost more money. Yet, on the Live Arcade, it labels this as the ~full version~ even though it clearly isn't and, at the release of the game, none of the other packs were even available for you to see what might cost more and how much you can expect to pay for it. Perhaps we should have done what Hilary Goldstein of IGN Comics suggested and give the game half of its score with the caveat that we would award the other half when the rest of the game is released.   It pains me to give a Lumines game a score in the 7's. I'm one of the biggest Lumines fans around, yet the cost and method of delivering the game is completely unsatisfactory and I simply can't give it the higher score that I want to.   Lumines stands absolutely as one of the brightest stars in the puzzle field in a long, long time. Q Entertainment hooked up winning gameplay to enticing visual and musical compliments, and North American publisher Ubisoft wisely left the game the way it was designed to be, fixing just the little glitches on a game that could have been entirely overhauled for western audiences. But in a genre that prides itself on minute-to-learn-lifetime-to-master gaming, we have seen a number of people still not get the game after that initial minute. We've also seen players, dedicated and adventurous gamers, not find the spark that would encourage them to invest a lifetime of play into the game. Most puzzle games are unilaterally love-it-or-leave-it, but perhaps because of high expectations and some features left wanting, this one is more an acquired taste.We've found there to be four stages to the Lumines experience. The first is Attraction: its hook-filled music tracks and lulling visual design set the backdrop for an effortless puzzle game that challenges players to simply put one of two colors together. The second stage is Addiction: once the sweeping music bar is understood and the first skin is unlocked, time becomes an abstraction in your quest to beat the music beat and unlock more songs. The third stage is Hunger: you find yourself desiring an escape from the common beginning stages, yearning for a deeper and closer experience with the stages you have recently unlocked; you also crave more complications in the gameplay and bigger dynamics in the presentation. The fourth stage is, naturally, Zen: your yearnings for fuss and choices dissolves once you have reached plateaus you previously thought impossible, and you find challenge and joy in the present options that once seemed simple and unadorned. Most will never achieve Zen -- even less likely without at least once feeling the thrill of multiplayer VS -- but somewhere between Addiction and Hunger is a good place to find yourself with a game that can take players deep, but on the surface is simply a brilliant little puzzle game.", "date": "Oct 19, 2006"}
