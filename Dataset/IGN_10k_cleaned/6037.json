This game falls under the latter category -- because I seriously doubt many mobile gamers expected JAMDAT, id Software, and Fountainhead Entertainment to work together to unleash the deepest, most satisfying RPG released on mobile thus far... and set it in the hellish DOOM universe. However, after spending a weekend with the game, I was amused by the clever storyline. I was surprised at how the refreshingly simple controls actually enhance the RPG experience. And for somebody that lugged his computer to a friend's house in 1993 to play DOOM, seeing old sights wonderfully resurrected on the smallest screen is a delicious trip down memory lane.   As I mentioned in my preview, DOOM RPG, although based on a 12-year-old game, feels incredibly new. There is no other game on handsets quite like it (although, I really do suspect that will change in the next six to eight months). We're all familiar with the DOOM realm, especially after the successful third chapter on PC and Xbox, but this is just such a slick way to present such hallowed ground without seeming like a cash-in or retread. Many of the monsters in DOOM RPG are taken directly from the classic PC game, as are the sound effects and opening music. Even the little Marine's face in the HUD, which changes from indifference to grimace to devilish smirk, is a kick-in-the-pants reminder of purer gaming days.   DOOM RPG is a turn-based RPG with many trimmings you expect from the genre. Instead of starting out with 100 health, you only have 30. Killing monsters, finding secrets, snuffing out fires, and other tasks give you experience points that soon add up. Gather up enough points and your marine hops up a level, and enjoys the benefits that come with it, like more health and armor. When you challenge a monster, you exchange attacks in turns. You go, it goes, you retreat one space, it steps forward. These features certainly put the RPG in DOOM RPG, but they aren't overwhelming. The pacing of it all suggests an action game with RPG depth -- nobody will confuse this with a Final Fantasy game. And that's what JAMDAT undoubtedly intended.   The game is absolutely giant. The maps are huge, with winding corridors and secret areas (you are judged at the end of each mission partially on how many secret areas you found). There are keycards to open doors, traps to negotiate, and several areas that must be backtracked through with new knowledge (such as passcodes). Fortunately, the game features a smart mapping system that actually lets you navigate your marine from the overhead map. So, if you've cleared an area of monsters, you can just open up the map and wander back to the area you need to access again.   The controls are the epitome of one-thumb. You only really need to use the direction pad, ~OK~ key, and the soft keys which flank the bottom of the screen. Many RPGs employ convoluted controls, but DOOM RPG's insistence on a streamlined interface actually lets you concentrate far more on the atmosphere and monster fights than remembering how to navigate into a eight-level deep inventory.   Speaking of monster fights -- there are a lot of them. There are no fewer than 38 monsters in DOOM RPG, each of them with specific weaknesses that can be memorized and exploited. For example, fire demons can be bested with the fire extinguisher.   As indicated before, DOOM RPG looks great. I've been playing the game on an LG VX8100, and on such a big, bright screen, the texture work looks right out of the classic PC game. The monster models are detailed -- not necessarily full of animation, but neither were the originals. (Which I think is on purpose, the game is a fresh 2005 twist on the 1993 classic.) The sound effects are appropriately crunchy.  DOOM RPG is a superbly playable mobile RPG. The game starts off with a good, easy level for players to get acquainted with the set-up and the general flow of game play, but wade a few levels deeper into hell and the game spirals out of control -- but in the good way. Monsters get brutish and aggressive, better weapons produce splashier bloodstains, and the puzzles deeper. Never a dull moment. Like I said above, although this is based on a game from 1993, DOOM RPG is a fresh experience for mobile. Very casual gamers might not get into this, but traditional vidders looking for an entry point into the mobile arena need look no further. Hugely recommended.", "date": "Sep 19, 2005"}
