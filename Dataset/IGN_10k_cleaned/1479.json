How could you forget, right? These guys practically raised us all into the strange and demented hairballs we are today from watching the pair wreak havoc episode after silly episode. How can one cat continually be so angry at such a sweet and innocent natured mouse as Jerry? Well, the fact that Jerry would usually pluck his whiskers and set his tail on fire probably didn't help.  But now we can finally live out our childhood fantasies of smacking Tom right in the kisser with a frying pan, thanks to developer VIS Entertainment and publisher NewKidCo. The companies have teamed up to bring Tom and Jerry: Fists of Furry to the N64, and just in time for the holiday sales season no less.  Chances are good that if you know nothing about this title already, you're probably expecting a 3D platforming game where Jerry must rescue his favorite piece of cheese from the clutches of the evil Tom while dodging sledgehammers and mousetraps the whole way. Well, fortunately VIS Entertainment decided not to go the standard cartoon license route with Tom and Jerry, and instead have delivered a wacky fighting title that most gamers will compare to Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. and Capcom's Power Stone for Dreamcast. It goes without saying that this latest addition to the action-fighting genre doesn't pass the mark left by Mario and gang on the system, but is it worth a look anyway? Here's what we think of Tom and the gang.  The Facts  One or two players simultaneous Action-packed fighting gameplay Eight selectable characters, including all your favorites from the classic cartoon series such as Tom, Jerry, that one junkyard bulldog, and, umm, all the others guys Ten interactive stages to compete, each modeled after the original cartoons Unique weapons and hazards on each stage Rumble Pak Support Progress data saved via built-in EEPROM  Gameplay There's a very good reason why Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. continues to drain massive quantities of power from homes all over the world: fast and perfectly balanced gameplay. So if a game were to be compared in any way, shape, or form to this system favorite, it would be a very favorable feather in its cap indeed. Fortunately for Tom and Jerry: Fists of Furry, that's exactly what happens the moment you grab a controller and start running around the room in circles. The game will remind you instantly of the Nintendo fighter classic, and the differences will also become apparent soon enough.  While SSB was primarily 2D gameplay, Tom and Jerry are free to run around in all three dimensions to both dodge attacks and return fire. Each battle ~arena~ is roughly square in shape, with boundaries on all four sides keeping you from wandering off. The game is organized much in the standard fighter scheme, where fights typically consist of a best-two-out-of-three approach. The default timer of 120 seconds keeps fights to a nice length, but these settings can all be adjusted to your liking, as some may prefer not to have a time limit at all.  Round One. Ready? Go! Players will instantly start scrambling about their environment, grabbing anything they can get their paws on to chuck across the screen at their opponent.  Such objects will vary from level to level depending on the type of setting you are located. For example, here are a few of the stages and the interactive items you will find to use to your advantage -- and to be used against you as well.   Catchin' in the Kitchen: A fully rendered household kitchen, complete with working fridge, sink, and dangerously hot stovetop. Items include: watermelon, rolling pins, frying pans, oven fire, and eggs. Bomb Voyage: The deck of a sailing cruise ship. Items include: deck chairs, bombs, wine bottles, life preservers, fish, and a bell. The Mice Before Christmas: A calm, cozy living room decorated in standard holiday season fashion -- Christmas tree and all. Items include: presents, candy canes, stick horses, roasted turkeys, and a flame-spewing fireplace. Laboratory Receiver: A typical cartoon dungeon laboratory, fully equipped with all the necessary machinery for monster experimentation. Items include: acid flasks, skulls, lightning rods, and a shocking electric generator.  All items are grabbed with a simple pull of the Z button (or any of the C buttons) and are then thrown directly at the enemy with a simple press of the B button. This button also servers as your melee punch button, the A button jumps, and the R button will allow you to duck under incoming objects. Unfortunately there's really not much else to learn here. The game definitely does not offer the same brilliant control found in SSB. It is simple and effective, but weathered fans of the Nintendo fighter might become bored after a short while.  Along with various items, players will also snag power-ups from the golden question marks that randomly show up. These random gifts are actually balanced rather nicely. For example, one power-up will render the player invulnerable to all items, but not to punches or environmental dangers. Another will plague you with a green gas cloud that can be passed off to the other player when touched. These random elements help keep the gameplay unique as you smack around the other rodent, but could really use a bit more variety than just the same four or so surprises over and over.  Overall the gameplay keeps things moving fairly quickly, with an average framerate and satisfying onscreen action. But the lack of depth is what will keep this title as an average action game.  Graphics The visual style in Tom and Jerry is right on par with the cartoon series of the same name, but honestly are not nearly as pretty as they could have been. While the characters are all modeled nicely and animated in great comic fun, the environments could use some work in places. Whatever you do, don't examine the previously mentioned Christmas tree too closely, or you'll swear you're going blind. Some texture use is just a bit too blurry in spots, and it's noticeable.   Otherwise the colors are bright and most objects are visibly recognizable in their 3D form. Considering the relatively few environments featured in the game compared to other titles on the system, we really expected a bit more of a polished look from the final version of this title. Nothing in the game is terribly beautiful really, but everything serves its purpose and fans of the show will be able to enjoy the title regardless of such graphical blemishes.  Sound The audio department is pretty much right on par with the visuals of the game -- nothing special, but it works. The sound effects feature continuous ~biffs,~ ~bams,~ ~squeaks,~ and ~splats~ as players bounce around the arena, and it suits the action well with little repetition. Most environments even feature background sounds such as ocean waves crashing against the boat, or a grandfather clock ticking. Nothing too fancy, but it works.  The music department is also a mixed bag, featuring very nice MIDI samples for instruments, but tracks that can get repetitive in a hurry. The ragtime tunes are a good fit to the crazy cartoon action, but after a good bit of gameplay your ears can begin to crave something new. This is one of those games that would have been much more well-received had it hit the Nintendo 64 a few years earlier -- back when it hadn't already been done...and done better at that. Some moments of gameplay can be quite amusing -- even laugh-out loud funny as you smack that poor mouse with a frying pan or watch Tom grab his butt and run around on fire. But in the end the title just falls flat and fails to keep you hungry for more.While Tom and Jerry: Fists of Furry does add a few new twists to the previous fighting efforts on the system, it just doesn't shine strong enough in any one area to be considered a ~must-own~ title. Fans of both the classic cartoon series and Super Smash Bros. should definitely consider it for a weekend rental when Mario and the gang are too pooped to fight it out. Otherwise, just stick with the Cartoon Network.", "date": "Nov 15, 2000"}
