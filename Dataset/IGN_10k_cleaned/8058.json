Now, there have been some other stinkers over the years  Hey You, Pikachu!, Tenchu DS, Nester's Funky Bowling  but no other title branded with the famous racetrack logo has been quite as bad as this one. It's shallow. It's short. It sucks.   Years before getting into the home console business, Nintendo focused much of its development resources on one-shot, self-contained handheld games called Game & Watch. These early '80s precursors to the Game Boy were fun diversions, simple game designs programmed to run on pocket-sized LCD displays. They were never meant for anything more than a quick fix of on-the-go fun. Urban Champion paid no attention.   Urban Champion sought to adapt one of those basic, sparse designs to the NES, and did so with predictably hollow results. The game is a fighter, a slightly updated take on the Game & Watch game Boxing. Slightly updated in that its setting has been changed to a city street, where two public pugilists go toe-to-toe, slugging it out on the sidewalk. And that's pretty much it.   You've got a grand total of four attacks in Urban Champion, the combination of two factors  speed and position. You can punch your opponent up high, in the face, or down low, in the gut. And you can punch either quickly or slowly, the slow option being more powerful but easier to block. Oh, yeah, you can block.   And that's the game. Alternating between high and low attacks, and fast or slow jabbing speeds, you seek to outwit your urban adversary and knock him backwards, a screen at a time, until finally he falls to his death by plummeting, helpless, headlong into the darkness of an open sewer-access manhole.   As a Game & Watch title, Boxing's high-or-low punching play made more sense. When you managed to knock down your opponent, they'd either be KO'd or would get back up, with less stamina than before  not unlike Wii Sports Boxing. But taken to the streets, the design's premise is laughable in Urban Champion. Two normal-looking guys trading blows in front of your favorite neighborhood drugstore, in broad daylight, pausing to look nonchalant and whistle in innocence when a police cruiser passes by. There were plenty of ridiculous concepts used for NES games back in its era, but you'd be hard-pressed to find one worse than Nintendo's apparent advocacy of barefisted downtown gang violence.  It's worth enabling the Parental Controls on your Wii system just to guard against the possibility of your friends taking hold of the controller and wasting 500 Points on this download while you're off and away from the living room. Urban Champion's design was fine as a Game & Watch handheld in 1984, but taken to the NES it was just too shallow. Its two-player mode adds just an ounce of redeeming value, but even that becomes a simple button-mashing contest. No, there's no reason at all to pick up UC on the VC. Unless you're over at a friend's house and want to play a joke by downloading it, while he's off and away from the living room.", "date": "Feb 15, 2007"}
