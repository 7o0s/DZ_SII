Incredible, we know. The game's action instead takes place in the very near future, 2008. Featuring current generation military vehicles and weaponry, war freaks will certainly be slavering at the chance to try them out. Joint Task Force's lengthy single player game features numerous multi-part missions, plenty of strategic planning, and a surprisingly substantial storyline. Unfortunately, it's got some glaring issues that can cause a significant amount of frustration.   You start off the game as Major O'Connell, the JTF's lead fighter. It turns out the world's ongoing efforts to end terrorism have done little good. Militant cells are popping up all over the place including Afghanistan, Columbia, Serbia, and Somalia, among others. Each mission opens with a briefing detailing what's to be done, though by the time you get on the ground priorities usually change. Maps will frequently alter their shape to reveal more as you complete objectives, which are radioed in to O'Connell from home base. Generally there seemed to be three to five different objectives per stage. Combine this with 20 missions, and you've got a substantial single-player experience. At least in terms of time required to complete it.    Joint Task Force distances itself from the standard RTS model by eliminating resource harvesting and base building. Instead, players complete objectives to collect cash rewards. Those rewards can then be used to purchase vehicles, supplies, or more men. Purchased soldiers are brought in via helicopter. The same goes for HMMWV trucks and supply crates. Bigger machinery like tanks and artillery pieces can only be brought in with a cargo plane, which requires you to first secure an airfield. Instead of back-and-forth warring between bases, JTF's single player portion tasks players with eliminating a set amount of enemies spread across the map. Occasionally your foe will reinforce themselves at key points in the mission, but you'll never be battling against an ever-replenishing enemy.   To balance your opponent's inability to consistently reinforce itself, cash rewards are pretty meager. After completing an objective, you'll generally just be able to afford a vehicle or two, or none at all if you need a medic, supply crate, or decide to call in an off-map strike. By the time you get to Columbia you'll be able to build up a larger force, but it'll still only be five or six tanks, a few attack choppers, and an AA battery or two. Since you'll need just about every unit you can get your hands on or commandeer from the enemy, you'll need to make sure they're always fully repaired. For that you need a FRSV, JTF's mobile repair unit.   This thing is usually given to you at the start of a mission heavy on vehicle usage, but can also be purchased from an airstrip (assuming there's one in the stage you're playing). It comes fully loaded with a team of engineers, ready to replenish damaged units' armor and ammo. While the idea of having to repair and reload all your tanks and planes between each battle may make logistical sense, it doesn't translate into an enjoyable gameplay experience. After nearly every attack, you're forced to halt everything and wait for everything to repair. Thankfully a double-speed button has been included to speed things along, but it still bogs down the flow of gameplay.    The focus on smaller groups of units doesn't mean they're limited in their capabilities. As it turns out, they can do almost too much. Ranger soldiers, for instance, can equip hand grenades, anti-tank rockerts, AA missiles, and C4 packs. Specific purpose soldiers like marksmen, medics, and engineers can be called in as well. Then there are the officer units, all with their own upgradeable skill sets. Most of them are passive abilities, like armor bonuses or better weapon use, but it's yet another aspect that adds more versatility to single units. Normally this wouldn't be an issue. When combined with the vehicle repairs, however, making sure all your ground troops are properly equipped to combat whatever threat lies ahead ramps up the downtime even more.   Is downtime such a bad thing? Not by itself. Units in Joint Task Force unfortunately get ruined extremely fast. For instance, if you move a squad of 20 rangers anywhere near a flak launcher, they're all dead inside 10 seconds. All that customization, all that time you just spent tweaking them for maximum lethality is exterminated. Vehicles go down quickly as well, especially the astronomically expensive air units. Attack choppers and jets will crash to the ground after only a few hits by an enemy air unit, and go down very quickly against AA turrets. Is it realistic? Probably. I can't say for sure, I've never been to war. Is it fun? Would you want to spend all your financial resources on troops and air support only to have them all wiped out in the time it takes to sip your coffee?     Since preserving units is such a focus in JTF, it's really a shame the vehicle pathfinding is so horrendous. Air units are fine, ground troops occasionally get mixed up, but tanks, HMMWVs, and other treaded units are immensely frustrating to direct. If a group of two or more is given a move command that passes through any kind of narrow terrain, you'll need to keep a close eye on their behavior. Numerous times we watched as vehicles spun around for, no joke, a full minute. Just spinning in place. Other times units did an about face and start driving off in the opposite direction. Assuming the vehicles actually start moving the right way, they'll often get in each others' way causing them to spin around or drive in circles.   These pathing issues carry over into combat as well. Tanks get stuck behind each other when trying to move into firing positions. You'll needlessly lose units since they weren't damaging the enemy quickly with one gun as they would have with two. Considering how vital preserving each and every unit is in this game, these pathing issues really hamper the experience. In open spaces the units can navigate more effectively, but there really aren't that many wide open areas in JTF.    Though you might start getting frustrated with Joint Task Force's single player campaign, it certainly provides a great lineup of multiplayer options. There are Cooperative, Deathmatch, Domination, and Battle Royal modes to start with. JTF, Dictator, or Terroist factions can be chosen along with one of three heroes for each faction, each of whom comes with specific skills and battle companions. Once all that's selected, there are still a ton of options to customize. Within each game mode players can set all kinds of regulations for when money is received to call in more units. Special settings like Armageddon, which causes all vehicles to explode at a specific time, Sudden Death, which drops all unit health by 90 percent, and Danger Zone, which makes parts of the map disappear at set intervals, among many others, can be applied to any of the game modes. It makes for a pretty crazy experience if you've got them all turned on, though it was hard to cobble together any kind of strategy with the map and capture points disappearing. The hardest part will be finding someone online to play with. We've seen between three and 10 people on when we've checked, though you can battle against the A.I. in any of the modes but Cooperative.   Visually Joint Task Force is extremely sharp. Great details are included like smoke spewing from a tank barrel after a shell's launch, excellent building destruction animations, really attractive water effects, fiery explosions, and the ability to knock out light sources. Nearly everything in the environment can be broken apart too. You'll frequently see tanks rolling over fences and taking down power lines to get where they're going, whether they're headed the right way or not. When zoomed in there's an excellent amount of detail on each unit, giving the game an authentic look. The camera, which can be rotated around in any direction, is a nice feature, letting you quickly spin the view around to whatever angle works best.    Voice work could be better, but some of the in-game effects are really good. Tank shots boom, machine guns resonate harshly, and the soundtrack works well with the onscreen action.   With Joint Task Force's pros and cons comes a particularly nasty bug. For the longest time, we couldn't get past the game's third campaign mission. It wasn't because it was too hard, but rather because the mission simply wouldn't end after we'd completed all the objectives. We were eventually told this was because we were damaging some trucks near the end of the stage. No less than 20 times did we retry this mission. We switched our prerelease review copy with the retail boxed copy and downloaded the 1.1 patch to no avail. As far as we could tell, the trucks didn't appear damaged at all. On top of that, there's no way to repair them. Eventually we had to actually use a stage four save file sent from the publisher to continue.   After checking around online, it seems this bug is only affecting some users so we can't say how prevalent it is. We can say it exists, however, and the 1.1 patch does not resolve it. Why a bug (or shoddy design element, we can't say what it is for sure) this serious was left in the game when it shipped is a mystery to us. Why not make the trucks repairable? Why not disable the requirement for them to be at 100 percent health for the mission to be completed? It was recommended to us that we try using non-explosive firepower to dispatch the enemies around the trucks. We did this several times and still weren't given a mission complete notification.Joint Task Force has an interesting storyline and a particularly deep set of customization options for tweaking units. With a focus on commanding small groups of units under strict financial limitations, JTF requires you to frequently repair and reload after battle which can bog things down. Then there's the fact that many of the game's units get wiped out very quickly, usually forcing a reload if they were on the more expensive side. Add atrocious vehicle pathing to that equation and you'll find the result to be frequent frustration. Sure it may be fun to spend all your funds on outfitting ground troops, but when they all get wiped by a machine gun as your own armor is spinning around in circles on the other side of the map, it doesn't matter what kind of guns you can give them. On the plus side there are some great options for multiplayer once you get sick of the campaign, assuming you can find someone online.", "date": "Oct 11, 2006"}
