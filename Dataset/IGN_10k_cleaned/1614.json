Yes, the game is based off the movie of the same name, and yes, itsuffers from the movie-licensing curse that has claimed several similar games.  And that's unfortunate because Dinosaur has some nifty gameplay concepts that remind me of the old SNES game The Lost Vikings.  But not enough to make up for the horrible collision detection, tedious fighting sequences, and an overall gameplay experience that just isn't fun.  Based loosely from the movie, you take the role of three dinosaurs: Aladar the iguanodon, Zini the lemur, and Flia the pteranodon.  As the game begins, a meteor has struck the Earth, and the three of you must escape to a different land else become extinct.  I don't know about you but for a dozen levels, the three animals move across a continent pretty darn fast.  Gameplay is mostly puzzle-based with some light fighting sequences.  Since you'll be attacked by all sorts of creatures, you can switch between the three, as each animal has its own special skills and varying attributes.  Aladar has the most life of the three companions and has the most powerful attacks making him the brawler, while Zini can easily avoid enemies' attacks due to his small stature and quickness and attack opponents from afar by throwing rocks.  Finally, Flia is nearly immune to any attack from land enemies since she's always in the air.  The different abilities really come into play with the puzzle elements.  As mentioned above, the puzzles remind me of the game The Lost Vikings, where each character possesses different skills that will help the entire party exit an area.  For example, Flia can scout ahead and pick up essential items and come back to the party at a moment's notice, while Aladar's powerful body enables him to bash rocks and bring down trees.  Zini boasts some Jordan-like jumping skills and his throwing talent allows him to hurl rocks with great precision.  You'll need to incorporate all these skills together in order to complete each level, and that will often spread out the party.  Thankfully, there's a mode that allows the party to travel together, so you won't have to constantly switch characters to move through each level.  The puzzle concepts are sound, but the implementation of the gameplay mechanics is quite poor.  The characters control pretty well, but the biggest problem has to be the lack of solid collision detection.  For example, if you select Aladar to attack with his tail, should an enemy attack you at the same time, there will be times you will get hit and times where you will be unaffected by the attack.  Worst yet, attacking dinosaurs have an ~invisible~ range at times; don't be surprised if you get hit by an attack from a dinosaur that's several paces away from you.  Bad collision detection doesn't apply to just combat either, as you'll encounter puzzles that require items to solve.  Problem here is that many times, when you place the item in the proper place, the puzzle won't be unraveled forcing you to go back and get the same item and placing it in the proper place again till the game finally registers ~hey, this is the right item!  Proceed to next area!~  Grrrr...  Visually, the game looks okay.  Pixelization is often seen with the budget water splashing and smoke trail effects.  Backgrounds display decent textures, though the level design is above average.   Character animation takes a dive, especially with Zini's badly animated jumps; sometimes it appears as if Zini is floating in air.  The game isn't very colorful, though this mostly has to do with the atmosphere of the game; having a meteor hit your planet will make everything look pretty gray.  One strange ~flaw~ that happens now and again is that the game's frame rate will, for no apparent reason, speed up a few frames.  This usually occurred when Aladar was running through water and it's not necessarily a flaw, but you can tell it doesn't belong in the game.  Once again, the main reason for the existence of Dinosaur is to appeal to fans of the movie.  Should any fans purchase this game, they'll be happy to know that the game displays a lot of the great CG sequences from the film.  Additionally, the game sports an encyclopedia that allows you to receive more information about the creatures that appear in the game.  But if I wanted to read about dinosaurs, I would go to the library... if I want to see the gorgeous CG of the movie, I would go to my neighborhood video store... and if I want to play a real video game, I'll avoid Dinosaur.  --Anthony ~The Fourth Viking~ Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 8, 2000"}
