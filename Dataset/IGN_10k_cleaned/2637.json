I was thrilled with it, put it together, watched the train go round and round and thought, ~Is this it?~ A couple of bent track pieces later and it went the way of discarded toys at the bottom of the toy chest.  I rediscovered model railroading at the state fair a couple of years ago when I saw an amazing rendition of the local railroad complete with water towers, buildings, people, horses, cars, and, oh yeah, trains. The detail was astonishing, and I finally started to appreciate the care and attention -- not to mention the money -- that people put into this hobby.  Auran's Trainz attempts to bring the feeling of model railroading to life for us without the pesky buying, collecting, gluing, and arguing with your spouse/parents about how much room it's taking up. You can build trains from countless engines and cars, run them over three continents, and create your own countryside and track. Pretty much like model railroading.  The level of detail Auran put into this game is astounding. One can spend hours just setting up the trains. After you get your trains built just as you like them -- using models of existing engines and cars from America, Canada, South Africa, Australia and Great Britain -- you can get into the driver's seat and control the train in detail. If you're more excited about just watching them go, you can let the autopilot take over.   The levels of realism are also built on a scale for people who want to run their trains at 100 kph through the mountains (derailment would be low in this case) to those who wish all rules to be as in real life, which gives a much higher chance of derailment if you decide to go for a joyride in a Santa Fe engine.   Much of the joy in the game comes from the models of the railroad cars themselves, it is apparent that much work went into the research for the art design of this game, and the hard work shows. The 3D models of the trains can be viewed from any angle, even from beneath, and show minute detail -- enough to satisfy any aficionado of model railroading. One wishes, however, that the surroundings got as much attention as the trains. You can set the weather to be a snowstorm, but the sky will still be be blue and the snow will never accumulate on the ground.   Sound leaves a little to be desired as well. While the train noises are realistic, as far as I can remember from train travel, the game is without any incidental or background music, which leaves the experience feeling a bit lacking. If you've ever been on a train you will know that the gentle sounds of rail travel can lull you to sleep, and the lack of background music almost gives the same stultifying effect to this game.   While the gameplay is enough to thrill any railroading buff, it does have a few other shortcomings. First, the interface lacks a great deal of intuitive class. This is not a game that's easy to pick up immediately without a glance at the manual. The 8 and 2 buttons on the keypad control the throttle and brakes for the engine. Since most laptops don't have keypads, you can forget playing the game on one. This is an oversight that cut out part of the market for no reason; they could have made the keys remappable.  What did you think of Trainz?  My last complaint stems from a streak of Gomez Adams in me. While fooling around with the terrain and figuring out which way my trains would point, I decided to put two trains head to head. They drove merrily along their tracks, and then ~Bump.~ They hit head to head, and the faster moving train became the dominant one, pushing the other one backwards. Now, I've never experienced this firsthand, but I've heard enough news reports about train crashes to know that they don't end in a ~bump.~ There's usually derailing, fire, general unhappiness. Call me a sadist, but I was disappointed when I didn't get my earth-shattering kaboom when I drove two trains straight into each other. ~Bump~ indeed.All in all, if you can struggle past the clumsy interface, put some good music on in your own background, and you don't mind the lack of an earth-shattering kaboom, then Trainz should be a nice, inexpensive way to fulfill your model railroading dreams.", "date": "Apr 25, 2002"}
