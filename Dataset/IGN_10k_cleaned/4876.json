Scooby, Shaggy, and the whole gang are household names after two feature film releases, endless cartoon reruns, and new shows in rotation on Cartoon Network. Macrospace, identifying Cartoon Network as one of the bigger pop culture repositories on the airwaves, inked a deal to create wireless games based on the channel's popular characters, including the Mystery Machine bunch.   Features:   14 levels  Play as Scooby or Shaggy   In Scooby Doo 2: Dark Dungeons, the gang has found themselves at the entrance of a spooky castle. Rumor has it that the castle keep's original owner, Lady Ebdon, squirreled away vast riches in the dungeon. There is an other interested party in the treasure, so it's up to Scooby and Shaggy to thwart this unsavory character's efforts.   Scooby Doo 2: Dark Dungeons is a isometric view platformer that mixes action with puzzle-solving. Using the ~1~ key, you switch back and forth between Shaggy and Scooby, placing them in different parts of the dungeon to solve simple puzzles. When you need to interact with an object, press the ~5~ key to trigger items.   The castle is full of creepy-crawlies, like mummies and bats. All it takes is one touch from these elements to send you to your knees, so keep an eye out for bad guys while opening doors and moving around pedestals.   Scooby Doo 2: Dark Dungeons is not a terribly complicated game -- in fact it's somewhat slow and simplistic. We wouldn't necessarily have a problem with a simple game, but there are not enough hooks to really keep you interested through the entire 14 levels. Movement is molasses quick. Getting from one end of a level to the other takes what seems like forever. And when you're having to position Scooby and Shaggy in different places to finish tasks and find clues... zzzzzz.    However, the game itself looks pretty decent. Scooby Doo 2: Dark Dungeons kind of reminds us of the original Genesis Phantasy Star games, what with the isometric view and the level of detail on the character sprites. You can easily tell who is who from their trademark clothing (orange turtleneck, ascot, etc.), but the characters are still small enough that they lack faces, fingers, and whatnot. When characters speak, though, a small face appears at the top of the screen that does have plenty of detail. Scooby himself is decently animated -- he probably fares the best of the gang.   Scooby Doo 2: Dark Dungeons has a small, slight soundtrack, but it works. The dirge-y tune compliments the gang's dingy surroundings.  Scooby Doo 2: Dark Dungeons is hard to recommend to anybody that isn't a die-hard fan of the cartoon classic. There is certainly plenty of longevity to the game, but some of that comes from just the absolute lack of speed. Nothing happens quickly, and because you move so slow, some hits seem cheap. However, the game has all of the trimmings you would expect from a ~Scooby Doo~ game, such as spot-on dialogue, so if you just can't get enough Mystery Machine action, this game may be your Scooby Snack.", "date": "Aug 3, 2004"}
