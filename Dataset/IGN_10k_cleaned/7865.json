Your only two criteria are that it should be like Riven and it should be Polish. I have the perfect game for you. If you're looking for a puzzle game from Poland then you can't do any better than Reah.  Reah is a planet devoid of life or resources. Despite this fact, a huge, top-secret base was established there. Wanting to discover why, you have come as a reporter to Reah to get the scoop. After a long wait, the authorities decide to let you in on the secret. The base has been established to monitor a dimensional gateway. Scientists have discovered a new world on the other side. Many have gone through to investigate.  You are given the chance to visit the other side and write about it. There's only one catch ... the portal is increasingly unstable. Risking total isolation against fame and fortune, you step through the portal. Suddenly and without warning, the portal collapses ... well, I probably don't have to tell you everything. Luckily, the planet is beautifully detailed and home to more than one cute Polish girl.  The scenario and the interface are typical. You're lost in a strange world and have to play errand boy just to get the locals to cooperate in getting you home. You view this world from a first person perspective and use a simple smart icon, point and click interface to manipulate your environment.  Visually, these games are usually pretty good and Reah is definitely no exception. The total number of frames is stunning. 40,000 frames of animation alone. At 25fps that comes out to ... carry the one, add the two ... over 25 minutes of action. Some of the animations are a little unstable and you'll see a few glitches and skips but they still look pretty good. All the animations are digitized images of real actors-and one real cat as far as I can tell.  Navigating the static world of Reah (or Reah's sister planet, I guess) is a visual treat. Everything is highly detailed. The transitions are smooth and relatively fast. This does a lot to increase your sense of immersion. While the V-Cruise engine does a good job of giving you a sense of 3D, you're totally limited in your movements within the world. There are pre-determined places to stand in each area and only a handful of facings for each. You're not just here to admire the scenery however. You maneuver around the world solving puzzles and meeting people (as a means of solving other puzzles).  Reah does a pretty good job of letting you know when you're facing a puzzle. The save game icon in the lower part of the screen disappears. Half the time that's the only clue I had that what I was staring at was a puzzle. Reah also has an auto-use feature hooked up to your inventory. No more trying to use lobsters on doorknobs or using stethoscopes on salad tongs. Nope, here it's all done for you. Once you enter an area where an object should be used, that object is highlighted on your inventory. This tends to eliminate a lot of the guesswork in these games.  Where Reah fails is in pointing you to the next puzzle. Too often I had no clue where to go next. Although the game is supposed to be non-linear, you can't skip more than two or three steps ahead without having to backtrack. True, there are some things you can skip, but only if you have a pretty detailed walkthrough. Luckily a walkthrough is available on the Project2 website, but even it was wrong in places.  The very first puzzle gets you into the city and is deceptively easy. I got the gimmick right away. After that, I was lost. I might as well have been playing with my monitor turned off. I went around and talked with the only two people I could find. Their speech made me think I was having trouble with my sound card. Then I figured out that they were speaking another language (Polish, maybe?). Turn out it's Reahan-or Reahish, I don't know. Your job is to figure out how to understand them. How? That's right, solving a puzzle. I won't spoil it except to say that it involves a talking three headed fountain. I never would have thought of that.  Once you find them, the puzzles are either too difficult or simply a matter of trial and error. There's lots of symbol matching and code type games. There are also a few timed puzzles where you'll have to run back and forth pushing buttons or clanging gongs. Many of the puzzles involve specific sequences of actions. Miss a step and you'll have to start all over again. One the other hand, one of the puzzles was so cliched as to be an outright ~gimmie.~ Of course you put the golden skull on top of the pedestal in the jungle temple! It just makes sense, that's why!  It seems like a huge game; it comes on 6 disks. And they had to squeeze to make it fit. With the walkthrough it shouldn't take more than a few hours to complete. Without it, it could take a lifetime. Depends on how good you are at puzzles, I guess. While it's a great looking game I wouldn't want to play it for long due to its high puzzle frustration and confusion factors. Even with the walkthrough it was a stretch.   -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Apr 20, 1999"}
