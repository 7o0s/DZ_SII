Okay, let me rephrase that...  with the explosion of the extreme sports game, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, no media has been greatly influenced by this new phenomenon than the video game industry.  Before Tony Hawk, most of the extreme sports game pretty much sucked big time (well, except 720, but that was a LONG time ago) and after Tony Hawk, every extreme sports game pretty much patterned the trick system play mechanics, camera angles, visuals, and ~feel~ of Activision's premier skateboarding title.  Still, despite the great sale success of Dave Mirra's Freestyle BMX and Razor Freestyle Scooter, no one has come quite close to capturing the same responsiveness of control, the great speed, and just the overall feel of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater... well, except Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2.  While it uses a modified Tony Hawk game engine, Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX isn't quite as solid as Activision's flagship skateboarding game, but it's nonetheless better than the competition out there and certainly an above average Dreamcast title worth checking out.  As mentioned above, Matt Hoffman uses a slightly modified Tony Hawk engine, and that's pretty apparent once you start the game. The camera angles, the speed, the controls, and the trick system are pretty much borrowed from Activision's skateboarding game.  That's not bad thing considering you've got the best extreme sports game engine to work with.  Gameplay follows the same format as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater - each area has a set of criteria you have to make in order to advance to the next level.  Whether it's scoring over 30, 000 points, finding scattered items around the level, or finding a secret  area, they all involve having one of the eight professional BMX riders (a couple of hidden ones to unlock) to go up and down ramps performing death-defying tricks.  There's no real story here as the focus of the title is centered on delivering a gameplay experience as solid and addictive as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.  The biggest differences that make Mat Hoffman unique from Tony Hawk are obviously changes that come from riding a skateboard versus riding a bicycle.  The trick system isn't different but there are a few more things you can do in Mat Hoffman, especially in the grinding department.  I did feel that balancing while grinding and while doing manuals (balancing on one wheel) is a bit more difficult than Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2.  The game moves a bit faster than the PlayStation version so don't be expecting any dramatic 60 frames per second facelift with this title.  For those that have played Dave Mirra, I'll give that game credit for something I wish Mat Hoffman had - trick combinations.  Granted, Dave Mirra's system may have given the player a bit too much freedom (as well as a bit lax on correct landings), but we've seen BMX freestylers perform backflips while performing a barspin at the same time, so why do I have to wait AFTER a backflip to do a barspin?  But to give credit, Mat Hoffman is surely a much more solid game than Dave Mirra as it's infrequent you'll come upon collision detection problems.  They still happen, especially funny landings that have you ~glued~ to the lip of a ramp, but they don't cause the same annoying problems as seen in Dave Mirra.  Also, I think the stage design could've been a lot better; there are some stages where you can get some great 300,000 plus lines, but some stages are kind of dull.  I'm not too big on playing multi-player with extreme sports games but the two players game of Mat Hoffman are okay, H.O.R.S.E. probably being the most fun.  When you get a PlayStation port to a Dreamcast game, the general standards are cleaner textures, bright colors, and improved frame rates.  Matt Hoffman barely follows these three guidelines, but the DC version does look a lot better than the PS version.  There's no graininess to the stages, a slightly brighter look to the environments and the frame rate is given a bump or two.  However, is it just me or could they have done a lot more?  Although the textures are cleaner, they haven't changed them so you still get rather dull looking walls and dirt areas.  Although areas look a bit brighter, there's not a whole lot more color added to decorate the DC areas.  Finally, this is a PlayStation game that chugged at mid-20 frame rates - so why can't the DC version stay at least at a rock solid 30?  The frame rate is marginally improved but I guess that all you can ask from Activision knowing that the system is on it's way out.  Criticisms aside, I enjoyed my turn at the handlebars with Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX and it still has a wonderful mix of punk, ska, hip-hop, and metal for its music soundtrack.  Some of the songs aren't as new as they should be, but they nonetheless add to the exciting extreme sports feeling.  It doesn't surpass any marks left by Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, but at least Dreamcast fans have another solid Dreamcast title in the form of Matt Hofman's Pro BMX... and in these final days of the Dreamcast, that's a gift we would do a few backflips for.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC Normally, I don't write these additinally comments, but seeing how the comparisons between Dave Mirra and Mat Hoffman will be invariably made, I feel I need to explain myself a bit.  Although I feel Mat Hoffman is a better game than Dave Mirra, why is Dave Mirra given the score higher?  That's easy... a different editor reviewed that game and since we're all human, different strokes for different folks.  If the question is posed what I would have given Dave Mirra had I reviewed, it's fair to say I would give it a lower score (1.0 - 1.5 points lower) than Mat Hoffman... just because you can combine tricks simultaneously together doesn't mean you can get away with lots of glitches.", "date": "Sep 18, 2001"}
