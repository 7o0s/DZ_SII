So every time we hear and see anything else Ghost Recon, we get excited and laugh and play and generally rejoice. Of course, it can never quite compare to the original excitement we had when the original was released, but the added challenge and fun of expansion packs is certainly enough to bring us back into the fold for a little while again. And the new expansion pack, Ghost Recon: Island Thunder does just that, bring us back into the fold for a little while. This is not a long game by any means, but the levels are designed well and there are some new surprises in store for you in terms of weather and environments, so those die hard fans will probably still find themselves immersed in a bit of new fun for that little while.   Ghost Recon: Island Thunder brings the Ghosts to Cuba, where things have changed a little bit from the present state of things. The long time seemingly undying dictator Fidel Castro finally lost to death in poker and has been removed from the planet. After 40 years of having the guy around and in their faces all the time, Cuba had to undergo some sweeping changes. After a bit of underling dictator fun that just didn't hang with the populace, the first free elections in decades is finally going to take place on the island country. But there're some rumblings amongst the natives. It seems as though one of the political factions up for election is trying to ensure that they're the only candidates by threatening and harassing the voting public.   That's where you and your forces come in. You're dropped onto Cuba to do a little bit of crowd control. There's something fishy going on and it needs to be solved. Your first of eight missions will begin things off by giving you the clue that these rabble-rousers aren't just funding themselves. Aside from grabbing some leftover Soviet weapons, they've got the help of some outside benefactors. Time to throw a wrench in their plans. The storyline progresses all right and ends up being kind of interesting, but certainly plays a backup role to the missions as usual. There's nothing that will totally surprise you about it, but I don't think I was really expecting too much.   The back-story is actually a pretty interesting premise. I like it when games postulate what could come just a few years from now. The setting is also fairly intriguing. You don't really hear a whole lot about Cuba anymore aside from Elian Gonzales. Cuba also gives the artists and level designers some new territory to work with for some nice environments and level design.   While I didn't find any of the levels particularly difficult, except for the fact that these paramilitary forces were better shots than my highly trained units, I did find them pretty entertaining and sometimes moody and stressful. The levels range in locales from the beginning plantation level, to abandoned airfields, to a battle through city streets, to mountaintop fortresses. All of them look as good as ever and feel like they could naturally exist. But what I found most fun was the difference in atmosphere in each of the levels showing off the crazy weather patterns that run across the island. The drastic change from a nice sunny day on the beach to gail force winds blowing thick rain all over your troops is dramatic to say the least. Those levels where it is raining provide some interesting gameplay as well. Running through these levels can be pretty frightening when you jump into them for the first time. Not knowing where enemies patrol creates the need for some cautious and intense gameplay.   My favorite level of the bunch was one that was very pretty, but also made terrific use of sound. Among the rocks and green grass, the wind was blowing strong and fierce and pounded into my ears. It sounded so good I could almost feel the breeze rushing through the rocky passes. That little thing made the environment that much more real. It's moments like that that really make you appreciate the work a good sound technician does. Sound tends to be overlooked in a lot of games, I'm glad it wasn't in this one.    What did you think of Ghost Recon: Island Thunder? After you're done admiring the scenery and flow of the maps, you'll find there's no want for action in Island Thunder. You'll have plenty of targets for your forces to fire on. Of course, on the other side of the coin, you'll also have plenty of targets firing upon you. And it seems as though they've been trained by the best. They're some crack shots, these Cubans. Often you'll just hear one shot and you'll find yourself falling to the ground. Seems a little strange for drug dealers and rebels. But eventually you'll make your way through the early levels and find some later levels that are a bit more challenging due to the spaces that you're fighting in and the number of enemies that populate them. When you're trying to protect the polling station in a city area, you'll know what I mean.   Finishing the single player levels by yourself with the help of the friendly AI won't take you too long (it took me about 5-6 hours on normal difficulty), but if you're a big fan, you'll probably find yourself going back into the levels with a group of friends to play co-op because some of the levels are just that nice. You'll also have the chance to jump back into the levels for a little bit of new multiplayer fun. The new modes are certainly a challenge. You and your friends should have a pretty good time trying to defend areas from the onslaught of enemies rushing a set area. You'll have to keep them out while you stay alive and in the area for as long as possible. There's a lot of enemies to contend with and keeping your body with its set number of holes is certainly a challenge.  Ghost Recon has had a pretty good run over the last couple of years. This one was a little more interesting to me than Desert Siege because of the atmosphere and cover rich environments, but it falls into the same category. It's a good expansion pack. It doesn't add anything extremely revolutionary, but adds 8 new well designed levels and some more multiplayer goodness.But that's why fans should want to pick this one up. It's more of the same. The same great gameplay. The same excellent level design. The same intense atmosphere. The same level of command and on the fly planning. It's just in a different location with different looking enemies. That's just fine with me.", "date": "Sep 25, 2002"}
