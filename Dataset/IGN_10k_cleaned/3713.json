So level with me: just what it is in the human psyche that draws relatively small third party developers to the idea of churning out game clones?  I mean, let's consider this rationally.  If your lookalike title eventually succeeds (and few do), it always draws attention to the original.  Who remembers Darkstone, Revenant or Nox, except as attempts of varying quality to do Diablo?  That's hardly a great selling point when you're trying to interest a publisher in your next project.  What's more, the return on investment is never very good if you take the time and resources to do it well, because you're living up to somebody else's standards; and if you do it poorly, you might as well be giving your money to charities for homeless victims of Turkish earthquakes.  In fact, those victims will probably treat you a lot better than the players and reviewers of your new title, after they actually play it.All these deep, philosophical musings have occurred to me in the wake of spending time with Mayhem Studios' new Empire of Magic.  It is a Disciples clone that also borrows the movement system from the Fallout series, and the regional map views of many contemporary RPGs.  But it hasn't got a handle on how to integrate these different concepts, and when it isn't being merely unimaginative, it just stumbles awkwardly.  Starting OutYou begin life as the apprentice mage Artemian.  Sorry: there's nothing configurable about his looks, sex, clothing, profession, starting spells or statistics.  The active view of your character and his surroundings is 2D isometric, with a close-to-vertical perspective that drastically reduces the amount of observable detail and animation.  While towns look when observed on the map (like buildings in Divine Divinity), moving your party into one simply brings up a static, poorly colored menu.  This isn't even an artistically pre-rendered town image with suitable hotspots, such as Disciples or Heroes of Might and Magic has to offer; just a series of one or two crudely drawn plaques with listed in-town locations.  Clicking a selection brings up a dark, anonymous interior image, which functions as the backdrop for whatever dialog boxes move forward the conversation and purchases.  It's almost redundant to point out that although EoM duplicates the menu based city-interiors of Disciples, the high artistic quality of the latter is completely lacking.  These images do create a mood, but it's one of irritation rather than expectation.  (Note that you're also locked into a screen resolution of no better than 800 x 600.)It's the people you meet that provide you with quests.  Some furnish special colleagues, who will join you for a while.  No more than three people can be in a party at a time, and no more than a single ~hero~ can join one.  (As in Disciples, the majority of characters you can hire are lookalike grunts identified only by their professions.  Heroes are special characters who have a separate identity all their own, and whose coloring is usually a little different from the other nondescript figures in your party.)  This being the case, each hero you control leads their own, separate party.There's an art to the strategic placement of multiple parties in a scenario, as any player of the Heroes of Might and Magic series knows.  Different groups with distinguishing qualities can share objectives or maintain separate ones, and develop statistics suited to unique tasks.  This art is an art of torture in EoM, however, thanks to the most counterproductive movement system devised since Major General George McClellan reorganized the Army of the Potomac.  The problem is one of map size.  Many strategy and RPG titles employ turn-based movement on large, strategic maps and in combat, where you can get wherever you need to go quickly.  EoM extends this concept to detailed local maps, as well.  This means that your parties can only walk a short distance in any direction, at any time, before running out of APs (action points).  You then have to end your turn, and start a new one.  Try doing this for a dozen turns in a row without any deadly encounters or specials of any kind, for multiple parties, and you'll quickly observe just how easy it is to bite your fingernails down to the second knuckle, bucko.  Why unlimited realtime movement wasn't used until your party chanced upon a friendly NPC or an unfriendly group of orcish real estate agents must remain unknown.  Another, equally counter-intuitive problem affects character selection.  In most games, you left-click on an entire party or character and then on an object. The type of interrelationship you want is intuited by the game, and you can immediately left-click another team element to provide its instructions.  This has been standard procedure in games since at least the early 1980s, with titles such as Chris Crawford's Eastern Front.  However, in EoM you have to right-click to deselect a party or character, before selecting another.  Failing to do so either voids the action you'd intended to take on the main map, or instructs one character of yours to attack another, in battle.Speaking of CombatI wish I could report that character selection was the only problem affecting conflict in EoM.  It's certainly annoying enough, at least until you adapt to the non-standard method of selection.  But there's more; so let's examine matters in a bit more depth.Upon entering battle, you switch to a 3D, animated screen, that again bears a startling resemblance to Disciples' combat view: your party lined up one side, and the enemy, on the other.  (Disciples, though, supports up to six protagonists per side.  EoM permits only three.)  Attackers always go first, without fear of reprisal until their turn is ended.  The number of attacks each unit receives depends upon the movement points saved from the main view, right before they entered combat.  Read that line over again, because it delivers a powerful helping of serious limburger to the proceedings.  On many occasions your parties can simply stand immovably within view of an outraged enemy group, and lure the latter into combat.  If you've calculated correctly, your foes should be very low on APs, and able to mount only one attack.  After that, you can pretty much wipe the field with consecutive attacks that leave nothing for a second combat round except a bloody smear on the pseudo-medieval astro-turf.    With more powerful enemies, an equally braindead solution is to send in one party to tenderize your foes, then retreat, and throw in a second party to take advantage of the absence of enemy APs.  There is no variety to this format, no interesting use of terrain, no flanking or rear bonuses.  Combat is as dull and repetitive as it sounds.Don't worry about smarter enemies employing similar tactics on your parties.  The enemy AI is inflexible and direct.  It instantly knows upon sight who the weakest member is in any of your groups, and immediately goes after that particular party and straight for that character in subsequent battle.  Unfortunately, that's you, little Artemian, with six hitpoints and a few wimpy spells that couldn't fry an egg on a Miami summer day.  If Artemian dies, the game drops to a cutscene you can't avoid (and will come to loathe once you've seen it half-a-dozen times), and then to the main menu.  There's no auto-resume from the last saved game.You can't really afford to keep your own personal hero out of combat, though, because the only way to stay alive later in the game is for Artemian to gain knowledge of vastly more impressive spells and the means to boost insignificant ones.  To do that, he must gain levels, which comes from causing combat damage.  This throws off the game balance severely.  Instead of weighing the most effective methods of dealing with various monsters or the best way to protect a badly wounded secondary character, your entire combat strategy centers around keeping your mage alive but in the action.  It's a serious defect in EoM's game balance to hand you such a dilemma when it does nothing to enhance the gaming experience.The Illusion of RealityBut that same shiny gaming experience that should accompany the test drive of any new title, regardless of its genre, is severely dented here in other respects, as well.  One of the worst to take major hits is the illusion of reality, that aspect of the game that draws you into a temporary and willing suspension of disbelief in a world.  RPGs and all but the most hardcore, abstract strategy games strive to make this happen, to build atmosphere. EoM tries, too, with its repetitive New Age soundtrack and its gothically dark menu colors, but it keeps shooting itself in the foot, as well.  There are just too many instances of things happening in the product that make no sense at all from a storytelling standpointFor example, take a glance at the basic premise of the storyline: that you, Artemian, the apprentice mage, have been saddled with all these important quests.  Why wasn't someone more obviously qualified (meaning, just about anybody) chosen for such vital tasks?  And why do all these other characters, from common soldiers to heroes, offer to join any group you lead at once, despite your complete lack of fame, authority, and training?  The reality of the storyline takes a severe hit with this one.  The RPG elements that define your character as a preexisting hero were far better integrated into games like the Baldur's Gate series or Planescape: Torment.  You had reasons others would listen to you, and fought in battle as one among equals.Or consider, for a moment, one of the tutorial quests, designed to introduce you to the basics of gameplay.  It's a rescue-and-accompany mission, a format you've almost certainly encountered in a number of other strategy games.  In most titles, you would expect the delivered Dwarven miners to be under your control, for their trip back to town; or failing this, to remain slightly behind the party, at a distance that would guarantee their safety while your people took out the enemy.  This would allow you to decide among several different strategies: an all-out assault on every monster in sight, careful scouting with one party to avoid all encounters, or something in between.  But in EoM, those miners simply take a direct line back to their camp and proceed as quickly as possible.  Your route is chosen for you by this action, just one of many instances where the game forces you none-too-sensibly into making the choices it wants you to make.Then, there are the guard patrol parties that scout the perimeters of some towns.  They're completely out of your control, and somehow manage to miss the monster parties that stand within view and make a bead straight for your group.  I understand perfectly well that Mayhem Studios wants your party members to never feel left out of the action, but they didn't have to be so blatant about it.  If guards aren't allowed to perform their proper functions so as to drive all the battles your way; if elaborate cities turn into largely empty menus when you attempt to enter them; if merchants refuse to serve or train you unless you perform supposedly ~optional~ missions: then the illusion of reality is irreparably broken for me.And while we're at it, there's one more overriding point that causes disbelief, at least, in me.  Here we have a relatively new company on the international stage, located in Slovakia, a part of Central Europe that has a rich cultural heritage of history and legends all its own.  Yet what type of people and creatures roam the landscape of EoM?  Skeletons, devils, dwarves, paladins, zombies, black knights: all the  clichd riffraff from our ubiquitous AD&D literature, developed over the last twenty years, as though nobody could think of anything else.  It's a shame Mayhem Studios couldn't dream their own dreams, rather than reselling cutrate versions of somebody else's.  To hell with originality; it means nothing.  Tolkien took his style of writing and elves from Lord Dunsany.  Shakespeare borrowed the themes of his plays from many sources.  Donald Rumsfeld is hardly the first belligerent politician with a big, fat mouth.  It's imagination, what you do with the material you've got, that makes the difference.  Especially if you want to stand out from the crowd, and gain attention for your efforts.Which is why I have to marvel on a regular basis why so many struggling computer game developers spend time, money and effort churning out inferior clones of popular products.  The products we seek out, play and remember fondly are the products that have a character all their own.  Empire of Magic borrows so much of its character from Disciples that if it had succeeded, the winner would have been Disciples.But it doesn't succeed.  Sections of the game, like the starkly empty town menus, feel like they never were completed.  Others, such as the combat system or the application of movement points on local maps, convey the impression of creative impasses that were abandoned.  There's precious little fun to mine in Empire of Magic, and no reason in my opinion to go through the effort.", "date": "Jun 16, 2003"}
