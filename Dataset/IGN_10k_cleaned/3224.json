The biggest, most popular game in the arcades for an unfathomable amount of years, SF2 was a sought-after property for both Sega and Nintendo as they battled for the hottest franch it'se around. Eventually snagged by Mario and company, Street Fighter II and Street Fighter II: Turbo Hyper Fighting went on to become some of the successful and popular Super Nintendo assets there were. For the longest time, gamers who craved their own brand of Ryu justice had one system and one system only to turn to. That  it's, until the Genes it's finally got  it's own platform-exclusive edition touting specific gameplay additions, graphical tweaks, and option changes that the SNES cartridge didn't have. For the first time in the game's illustrious h it'story, player's had a choice as to where they could fight --and they were happy about it. Funny how h it'story repeats  it'self...And repeat  it'self it has. Though the major console players are different and the developers just as diverse, Namco's Xbox action piece Dead to Rights finds  it'self in a similar position to Capcom's Street Fighter II from all those years ago. No longer exclusive to the system that bore it and a free agent in the land of available platforms, the wildly popular and violently epic tale of a K9 officer's quest to clear h it's name has finally arrived on the PlayStation 2 and GameCube. And while the game  it's still not as pol it'shed as it should have been (especially in terms of the hand-to-hand combat and animation), the system-specific enhancements and play-oriented changes that Namco have put into th it's newer version definitively warrant a second look; or first look, for those of us who haven't played it before.FeaturesSurpr it'singly there've been a large number of alterations and changes made to accommodate new players, and depending on your point of view it can be either a good thing or a bad thing. The most immediate difference  it's the alteration of the game's difficulty. Previously set to a single challenge type that pushed gamers to their maximum lim it's, the PS2 and Cube version of Dead to Rights has been made a lot easier. Rather than slug your way through multiple cellblocks and several mini-games to make it through the pr it'son level for instance, gamers can now simply battle through the initial block with no need to participate in the sub-games for advancement. And though you can select from four separate challenge levels, none of them, not even ~Super Cop~ mode, match the same level of difficulty that the original Xbox adventure provided.  But there are other changes as well. Various tweaks to the speed of your character when he's using a bad guy as a human shield and the addition of hot keys for use with your weapon and trusty mutt Shadow have been included to eliminate the nasty directional cycling we had to trudge through on Xbox. Additionally, the targeting system has been modified to automatically focus on more immediate threats rather than proximity, and an inverted camera option was added for increased performance for those backwards control freaks. One of the coolest new goodies however, has to be the earlier access to some of the more complicated d it'sarms. Originally unlocked by performing three d it'sarms of the same type within a given area, the more spectacular moves are now much easier to come by (in other words, you only have to do them twice instead of thrice).Even the hand-to-hand combat system has been somewhat refined. As the types of moves certain enemies perform are based on their ranked position in the game. In the Xbox version of Dead to Rights any opposing character could dodge and block an attack, making every opponent a serious danger. With the new treatment given to the A.I. however, the lower-class enemies will only block instead of dodge, and the main character Jack can no longer be knocked to floor by any move other than a throw. Finally, the camera pans further back from the action when Jack  it's surrounded so as to provide a much better vantage point for the battle.    One of our biggest complaints with Dead to Rights initially was the redundancy of the mini-games and how taking the time to solve most of them removed some heat from the pace of the game. To address those concerns, Namco has toned down the number of sub-games in the main adventure quite a bit, while making challenges like the speed bag and weightlifting optional instead of required. To appease fans of those types of mini-quests however, the programmers have also seen fit to include an option in the main menu that will let you jump to any game you've already completed at any time.Of course, it would be an injustice not to mention features that already ex it'sted as well. The 20-plus d it'sarm types for example (methods by which to remove your foes gun and kill them) and plethora of weapons at your d it'sposal are but a few of the cool goodies that add true action-movie flair to your adventure. Shotguns, silenced p it'stols, grenade launchers, machine guns, and all manner of explosive devices can be equipped and reused throughout Dead to Rights' 15 short but gory chapters. Combine that with the over-the top blood spattering effects and adult-oriented atmosphere, and you have yourself a very appealing third-person shoot 'em up.GameplayRegardless of how you try and hide it, Dead to Rights  it's a straightforward action game with few tactical elements. Moving from linear point A to linear point B while blasting every living thing in sight, your objectives are always the same: ~Kill it all!~ And while the developers have seen fit to mix up the monotony of going from place to place by adding small little objectives here and there (kill one dude in particular and get h it's key pass so that you may advance, etc.), the mood, pace, and direction of the gameplay rarely changes. But understand one thing -- th it's  it'sn't a knock against it by any means. The game  it's great fun and  it's good for what it  it's. I just felt it was necessary to warn the masses that th it's  it'sn't the free roaming world that Grand Theft Auto or Super Mario Sunshine  it's.Moving around and shooting guys  it's as simple as can be; sort of like a cross between the Minority Report game and Vice City. Targeting your foes  it's handled with a slight tap of the right trigger, while cycling through multiple opponents  it's handled by tapping the trigger again. More responsive and more intelligent than the targeting system found in Vice City, getting killed by the immediate threat in front of you  it's no longer the result of a poor aiming system, but rather, your failure to act how you were supposed to. Controversial as it may be for the die-hard GTA fans out there, Dead to Rights takes the same targeting system that Rockstar's game does and makes it better.  In addition to firing different weapons with the method mentioned above (you can cycle through them with the directional pad), you can also grab your opponents for use as a human shield or to d it'sarm them. Available to you only if you have no ammo left in your weapon, the d it'sarm maneuver  it's a spectacular way of removing your foes weaponry for your own while quickly d it'sposing of him. Giving the player an opportunity to change camera angles and slow the action down while doing th it's only sweetens the pot further, and in the latter levels of the game, the d it'sarm and human shield techniques play a pivotal role in your survival; most importantly though, they're fun as hell to mess with.To compliment the d it'sarm system and protect you when you're without a weapon, there's also a limited hand-to-hand combat system that hopefully you won't have to use. My least favorite aspect of the entire engine, the supposedly improved guerilla combat  it'sn't as entertaining or as fluid as the gunplay. Confined to a small amount of canned combos and less than damaging attacks, the one, sometimes two button fighting techniques are robotic, bothersome exerc it'ses in monotony. Why resort to the f it'sticuffs with th it's guy if you could just shoot him? Fortunately, you'll only be required to beat somebody senseless a few times per game, and for the most part find yourself armed with a shotgun or similar weapon. Hallelujah!    And that's where the meat of th it's game really lies: the entertainment value in shooting anything that gets in your way. Spread out across various locales, the dumb (and I do mean dumb) A.I. does everything short of serve their own head to you on a silver platter. A joke in the lower difficulty levels, the best fun you could hope for involves cranking th it's sucker all the way up to ~Super Cop~ and having at the natives. Filled with a flood of opponents, tons of weapons, and a lack of health upgrades, it?s the surest way to guarantee the most bang for your buck!That said, I still couldn't help but m it'ss the more strategy-oriented segments from the Xbox version. After changing the difficulty level of Dead to Rights so drastically and removing the majority of the mini-games, it seemed almost too easy to move from one section to another. Hard games are better than easy games, and while I understand the changes made were for the most part good ones, they were all things that could have been done without sacrificing the challenge. I liked the fact that the Xbox game made you figure out an exact path with multiple weapons, d it'sarms, and human shield possibilities before conquering any given level --it gave me a true sense of accompl it'shment. In th it's latest release however, for the first seven or so stages, I could go into any room with guns blazing with little to no consequence. It was fun sure, but not as fun as it used to be.GraphicsWhile it's obvious that the Xbox version of the game  it's the best looking out of the trio, the GameCube and PlayStation 2 attempts aren't far off. Superior in terms of texture and lighting effects on Microsoft's machine, the new edition actually has more particles --Blood geysers, bullets, and other flailing objects are in abundance, and the sheer amount of sparks and other airborne gibs are too numerous to count. Of course th it's comes at a price, and in the PlayStation 2 version in particular the framerate slows down to noticeable sub-30 performance. Luckily that doesn't happen every time you play, and only occurs in the graphically intensive, heavily populated areas (like the dance club). The GameCube rendition fares a bit better, but the occasional slowdown still rears  it's ugly head. Regardless of the system however, all the games are lit splendidly and look fantastic.  Though I do have to question the v it'sual style chosen by the Namco when all  it's said and done. Granted, the character models look moderately decent and the detail on their clothing  it's sound, but the animation by which they move  it'sn't all that hot (except in the case of d it'sarms, which perfectly recreates that classic cinema-type combat). Additionally, the faces of the characters are somewhat lifeless and appear far blockier in compar it'son to the rest of their body.The camera too possesses  it's share of problems, and despite the fact that you can move it in a limited way, it's sometimes hard to tell what's going on. Especially when you're fighting inside enclosed spaces. Bump up against something unexpectedly or get caught backpedaling near a wall, and you'll move into a strange first-person type mode that makes it difficult to determine where you're supposed to shoot and at whom.The CG however  it's great, and offers some of the best direction in an action sequence for a videogame th it's year. A cross between the Die Hard films and Tango and Cash, the idea that you're playing through an honest to goodness action film  it's solidified through these cut scenes.   SoundI enjoyed the score to Dead to Rights quite a bit. Following in footsteps of other tried and true action bonanzas like Lethal Weapon or the aforementioned Die Hard, it's horn-heavy, bass-thumping soundtrack follows each of the 15 stages to perfection. Certainly one of the better action scores in all of 2002, I could see the composer's final compilation legitimately making it into a feature film. It's that good.Too bad the vocals aren't as good. Of the entire cast, only the hero Jack and h it's stripper girlfriend stand out as somewhat convincing. The rest of the players all seem to have graduated from the Steven Segal School for not so gifted actors. But hey, at least the effects are tight, and sound just like the real thing -- no matter the type. Whizzing bullets, clanking metal, gas can explosions, and the moans of working girls in various brothels are but a few of the many audible b it's that combine for a convincing package of aural stimulation (that's aural stimulation folks!).  Namco's Dead to Rights is splendid action opus. Obviously inspired by the adventures of John McClain, Martin Riggs, and similar unlikely heroes, this particular take on the one-man army captures their spirit like few have before it. My only wish was that the challenge from the Xbox version made it through with the rest of the changes. Unfortunately it did not, and when combined with the still-broken hand-to-hand fighting mechanic and level structure that keeps you moving forward no matter the circumstances, the DTR's potential runs a little short.Despite those qualms however, Dead to Right is an impeccable way to spend your weekend. Short, explosive, and a roller coaster ride chalk full of violence, Namco's stab at cop vengeance is a great time while it lasts. Even it was made easier for John Q. Public.", "date": "Nov 18, 2002"}
