Now imagine a game that has none of the above.Welcome to Cruis'n USA.Cruis'n USA. was one of the first games announced for the Ultra 64. The idea is simple: Drive through the United States in one of four (plus three hidden) cars and manage to beat the other racers. Given the long development time and the fact that Nintendo promised to exercise their strict quality control on this Williams/Midway racer, this should have been a top quality game. It's especially embarassing that Nintendo published the title themselves, furthering the gap between the quality associated with Japanese made games and NOA's sorry American attempts. Cruisn', by the way, will probably not see the light of day in Japan.The opening of the game isn't really all that bad. But it all goes downhill from there. The game is everything it shouldn't be. Instead of expanding on the (aging) arcade racer's theme by adding N64 specific features, Midway basically made a bad copy of the arcade version. That's like Sega bringing out Virtua Racer on the Saturn without any improvements or additional options. So much has happened in video gaming that Cruis'n U.S.A.'s flat bitmappy graphics look very dated -- especially since Nintendo's own Wave Race 64 has shown what the N64 is capable of.The pace is slow, the frame-rate often choppy (especially in city zones) and somehow excitement doesn't really kick in. For some strange reason I still felt compelled to drive through the whole country, just to be able to say: ~There, I finished it!~ Little did I know that it would only take me about two hours to finish the whole game.The graphics look flat, but offer some nice detail in some of the levels (like Chicago). To achieve a modest feeling of speed, switch the viewpoint to a first-person perspective. There are some nice little touches, like flies that smack into your window and birds using your car for target practice, but that's about it.The music is bad. Not only are the midi sounds badly selected, but the compositions are really rather annoying. Thankfully, you can turn down the volume. There's a short glimpse of potential when you hear a guy singing ~cruis'n', yeah!~ (that's how it should be spelled) over a midi soundtrack, but it soon lapses back to Pilotwings/elevator music gone mad.The sound effects are okay, but yet again Midway shows a total lack of attention to detail. For example, when your car jumps over a ramp or a bump, there is no difference in the engine sound--and even when you hit the ground, there is no corresponding impact noise.Collision detection is bad. Sometimes you spin out because of an invisible enemy behind you, other times you're caught in a crash that's more like a traffic jam than anything else. And try running into one of those huge redwood trees. It simply falls over like a cardboard sign. Level design is unexciting and nowhere near Wave Race or Mario Kart. Sure, it's nice to have linear tracks, where you don't always come back to the same obstacles. But there's also nothing like coming around the corner for the third time, you're in the lead, and you can already see that dreaded curve up ahead that gives you problems every time. This sense of anticipation, or of worry of a tricky spot is almost gone in a linear racer like Cruis'n.The two player mode is Cruis'n USA's only saving grace. Unfortunately, the frame rate drops even further and the odd impact detection makes pushing someone of the road a matter of luck, not of skill.Let's face it, the arcade game wasn't all that hot to begin with -- but the final N64 version turned out to be even more disappointing. Ignoring the dated gameplay and less than impressive physics and handling, at least graphical problems like pop-up and low framerates should have been fixed. Unfortunately, this game is probably doomed to be the nadir of N64 racing games for many years to come. Rent it for a few hours of fun, but don't waste your money on it.", "date": "Nov 15, 1996"}
