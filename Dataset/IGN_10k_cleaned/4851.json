Every so often it's bound to happen, though. You know a slip-up, a mistake, a wrong guess. That one game that maybe they shouldn't have bought the movie rights to. That's Catwoman. Or as I like to call it, Shatwoman. Based on the movie of the same name, nearly everything is wrong with this one. It's a shoddy, short, and frustrating title with annoying controls and an exasperating camera, based on what looks like a shoddy movie that seems entirely created to show off as much as Halle Berry's skin as possible. Yes indeed, black is beautiful. And as a healthy, red-blooded heterosexual man, there is nothing on Earth wrong with seeing Halle Berry looking athletic and sexy. As always, she is absolutely stunning. But is that enough on which to base a movie and a game? I can answer the game part, and the survey says, no -- 100% no. Even your cat will want to bury this one in the litter box. Story Catwoman is a third-person action-adventure platform game with a huge amount of exploration and a moderate amount of combat. Based on the Warner Brothers movie in conjunction with DC Comics and due in the theaters on July 23, EA's Catwoman is the unfortunate tale... or shall we say, it's the second, newfangled origin of Catwoman (not the original DC Comics Catwoman based on Selena Kyle).  Patience Phillips is a woman with confidence problems, and as an underling at the Hedare Beauty Design firm who finds herself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Only this last time, she's mistakenly discovered that her company is steeped in deep research that's ethical troubled and illegal. She discovers the information mistakenly, and a company henchman kills her to cover it up. This is where the comic book part comes in. She is supernaturally revived by the kiss of an Egyptian cat and brought back to life as a wild woman in shredded black leather. Reow!   Patience Phillips is dead, and in her place is Catwoman, a powerfully athletic, nearly invincible predator with a liking for shiny jewels, diamonds, and causing trouble. Her raison d'etre is to find who killed her and learn why, seek revenge, and eventually discover who she was.  Strategy   Guide! IGN Insiders get access to our complete strategy guide for   Catwoman.

Gameplay The game loosely follows the movie, and EA Europe and Argonaut have done the best job possible given their strict and unfair time allotment of about eight months to create this game from the ground up. While I sympathize with EA's plight to get this out on time, the final product isn't something I'd ever want to willingly play, buy, or ever recommend to anybody. It's not the downright worst game ever created, because there are some redeeming qualities to it, but they're far outweighed by the game's trouble spots. Designed like a hyper athletic Tomb Raider (which sounds pretty good at first), Catwoman is really an adventure-platform game in disguise. Your super heroine can run up, jump up, and traverse walls. She's able to acrobatically swing from flag poles to metal beams, she can handle parallel bars well, and she can cling to wire textures. The game is designed with large, extremely high physical puzzles, and using her feline ~Cat Sense,~ she is able to see the green glowing hints of where to go to next. In short, she's extremely dexterous, nimble, and able to move around her environment very well.   The issue, however, isn't the scope of her abilities. It's their execution. As part of EA's trend to use the analog controls come hell or highwater this pretty looking but vexing game suffers most from its annoying control scheme (followed by its hellaciously disturbing camera setup). Using the analog controllers and trigger (shoulder buttons) in conjunction to pilot Catwoman around, players are placed in old-school, trial-and-error physical puzzles. They're required to pull off precise moves with imprecise controls. Things like the whip arch are tough to pull off because Catwoman seems to often drop the whip in mid swing. Other times, you cannot see the next object because of the camera's insistence on facing Catwoman at all times. That's when you fall 10 stories and have to start over.  And once you've fallen several times, you might find yourself wondering why you bought this game. Is it really worth the trouble? There is something terribly false about the whole Catwoman premise. It feels and plays like a cheap, quickly-made game. It feels like an excuse. It's based on a movie that looks so bad in the movie trailers alone that even a diehard comic book guy like myself won't see it. There is so much focus on glitz and Halle and sexiness that the core, whatever that might have been, seems quickly shucked in favor or purely visual tomfoolery. The combat system, while upgradeable, is super simplistic, and the enemy AI is limp. The Capoeira-style moves (Wha??!! Catwoman knows Capoeira??!!!) make you feel like you're doing awesome things, but really you're pulling off the simplest of combos. Again, it's visually appealing, but after a fight you're left feeling hollow and empty. Like you've beaten up a kid or stolen cookies from the Girl Scouts. Not such a fantastic emotion.  The standing animation alone is a perfect example of where this game's priorities are. Let Catwoman idle for about a minute and a looping peep show begins its run. Berry grinds her hips, feels the slick leather on her legs, and licks her hands like a cat, finishing off with a wink at the camera. It's pure fluff.   Despite all that, there is some fun to be had. It's just far and few in between the hateful times. The tracks or footprints left by your familiar cat friend are smartly laid out, giving players a hint of where to go next. Each new room is like a big maze, in which you must trace the clues to climb, jump, or swing to the next stop. When you're successful in beating a level a certain level of satisfaction does set in (mixed with rage, of course).  At the end of each level you earn points from the execution of moves (all of which are rather confusing in the beginning), and you can buy new ones, about 10 or so. The upgrades do improve the fights a bit, but they can't repair what's already an overly simplistic fighting system.  Graphics If there is one thing that is done well in Catwoman, it is EA's ability to make Halle Berry's digital re-creation look excellent. Catwoman is slender, sexy, she moves well, and she is motion captured well enough to fool the eye into believing she's moving with grace and style. There is also a health lighting system that gives Catwoman a nice aura, a glow, softening her edges, and once again giving her a sexy sheen.  The rest of the graphics are rudimentary, dull, and unimpressive. The enemies are bland looking, Sharon Stone's character looks like someone else entirely, and the backgrounds are plainly textured, and forgettable from a color and design standpoint. What does stand out visually is the complex arrangement of objects organized for Catwoman to jump onto and from. Otherwise, forget this one in the graphics department.  Sound The music in Catwoman hardly stands out above the sleepy roar of everything else. The theme song, presumably from the movie, is pretty good -- dramatic in fashion, a little Danny Elfman-esque, and somewhat moving. It's rather overused, even though it never actually gets in the way. The cutscenes are a joke, filled with sleep-inducing lines and poor voice acting.There is nothing left to say, really. There is a lot of sheen resting over what's essentially an empty shell. While the development team has done a better-than-average job of heaping sparkles and gloss over these broken bones of a game, the end result is that Catwoman is a overly simplistic combat game. It's a rather interesting adventure game marred by annoying, imprecise controls and an even more maddening and nonsensical camera. And it's a game that reeks of movie license money -- a failed attempt at style over substance. If you absolutely love everything about Catwoman and you can't have enough because of your sheer love for the property, well by God, then you should probably rent this game. For rest of gaming public -- 99.9% of you -- stay far away. You don't want to cross this cat.", "date": "Jul 20, 2004"}
