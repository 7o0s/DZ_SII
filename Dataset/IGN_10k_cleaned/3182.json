Rally Fusion: Race of Champions puts a slight arcade spin on the sport of rally racing, and along with using the Race of Champions license, it broadens the breadth of race courses and challenges to give gamers a sometimes grueling but always well-rounded rally experience. Rally Fusion lives up to its namesake: It's genuinely a fusion of racing styles and, in that, it's a good thing.GameplayInstead of an investment on creating the very best physics engine on the planet, Climax Brighton engineered a very good one, capable of achieving a high degree of visual polish, a good framerate and better than average car dynamics. The engine enables players to truly race like a rally driver, giving them the possibility of teetering, riding on two wheels and flat out flipping. Cars incur real damage and the vehicles show it, with breakable windows, hanging or dropping fenders, detachable hoods and panels, and damageable engines, wheels and drive trains. You can see it, but more importantly, you can feel the affects, at least to a moderate degree.But the game gets off to a slow start. With the more powerful and faster cars driving substantially better, it's crucial players give this some time to work up to the second and third tier of vehicles. It's with those first cars that players might have the biggest problems. These first cars, particularly the RoC Buggy, Opel Kadett and Toyota Rav 4, aren't too fun to drive, and what makes them even less than appealing is two-fold. Given the game's structure, the ROC Challenge is at its heart: It's the mode players open up new vehicles, courses, challenges and more. So unfortunately, you have to drive these less than desirable cars in order to get to the better ones. That's a standard practice among racing games though, so it's not too much of a ding. The second issue is that the driving physics, while substantial, consistent and good as far they go, aren't that sophisticated. Handling powerslides in many of these cars is a difficult and annoying task, and it's this very aspect of rally games I normally enjoy most. Again, my major complaint is against the earlier cars, but that's what one must drive at first. These cars simply slide and continue to slide, without giving the driver enough control to regain control. Usually I can slam into a powerslide and manage it, alternating on gas, brake or by simply steering freely. Here, I throw the car into a turn, let off the gas, wait and pray. It's not a good practice. The chance of coming out of it feels like a roll of the dice, not a skill-based affair. Naturally, it is indeed a skill-based game, but the these early cars handle so poorly you feel less like you're driving rally cars and more like street cars. Like I did, you too will (hopefully) get past these tedious vehicles, and the rally racing gets better, but it's still more or less a small punishment to drive them. Climax Brighton's engine provides an interesting set of rally controls. The cars are generally a little rigid to control and light in weight. There seems to be an equal distribution of weight throughout the entire car, rather than being centered in the front or back. And so, with this weight distribution in mind, sliding, braking and handling hairpin turns becomes an experience that ranges across the board, from manageable to un-manageable. Sometimes, cars get into a slide and you simply have to wait the action out, be it good or bad. But that's not my idea of great rally racing.Beyond the game's workmanlike controls, the garage of 19-plus cars ranges in style and driving characteristics that help to deepen the game. After beating Class C (which includes five cars, the Ford Escort Mk 1, Opel Kadett, Toyota Rav 4, RoC Buggy, and the Formula France), players slowly open up Class B and then Class A. The ROC Challenge is the place to open the biggest set of rewards, setting up 15 different challenges.Class B (cars that have raced in the real World Rally Championship) includes the Ford Escort Cosworth, Lancia Delta Integrale, Mitsubishi Lancer Evo VI, Peugeot 206, Peugeot 306, Seat Cordobra, Toyota Celica GT4 and the Toyota Corolla. The Class A vehicles (generally considered group B cars, but separated for this game) feature the Audi Quattro, Lancia 037, Opel Manta, Peugeot 205, Saab 93 Turbo, and the Lancia Stratos. Climax Brighton's game offers four modes of play: Race of Champions, Quick Race, ROC Challenge, and Custom Championship. Race of Champions consists of two races, the ROC -- in which eight races drive through a knockout tournament for the crown -- and Nations Cup -- a team-based knockout tournament involving two out-of-three heats. Quick Race enables player a quick one-off race in a multitude of challenges. It's a good place to get acquainted with the cars or to challenge a friend. ROC Challenge is the game's core mode, as described above, and Custom Championship offers gamers the chance to create their own rally, rally cross and circuit championships.     Where the game shines most is in its good looks and extensive race selection. The ROC challenge itself doesn't simply place drivers in one track after another of straightforward rallies. Instead the Germane structure is peppered with diversity. Players find themselves in rally crosses, circuit challenges, straight rallies, follow the leader, hill climbs, elimination, head-to-head races and Race of Champions challenges. The constant barrage of challenges kept me awake and aware and actually offered enough variety to get me past those hateful early cars. A good example of a race that sticks out most in my mind is the Hill Challenge. Starting from the lower, flatter regions of a mountain, drivers work their way up to the top and in doing so, they cover the gamut of surfaces, from dirt to tarmac to ice and snow. The course is well designed with a healthy dose of hairpin turns and some smart snaking curves, and the result of small mistakes is a whopping launch off the mountaintop to your death. One of the courses I started out hating but eventually grew to bear is the Inca course, a muddy, groggy England-style course that nails you with hairpin turns and elevation differentiations. It's a tough one, but fun once mastered. I still don?t actually like it but it's such a big challenge, I can't refuse it.My gripes are numerous, relatively small, But they add up; and I promise not to repeat the control issues from above. While the game offers a good range of rally challenges, for the most part the course designs aren't the best I've experienced. It's a mixed bunch, and after having played the Gran Canaria course extensively, for instance, I can honestly say I'm not a big fan! Course challenges such as the parking-spinning-slalom level aren't that titillating either. While there is a good interface, the load times are long and often -- even between menus. And the lack of any serious modifications makes the feature entire useless. The default modifications take care of everything and you simply don't need to think about any kind of change to win. Honestly, if you want sim rally racing, this isn't your bag. Last, the game runs at a breezy 60 FPS nearly all the time, but in several courses it drops and when it does it hurts the eyes painful bad.GraphicsClimax Brighton definitely pulled out all the stops in the visuals department. Most notably, the game shows off the full scale of special effects on PS2. In the desert courses, the blazing sun shines down hard, creating heat waves, lens flares and a short and long range blur effect, first shown in Ridge Racer V. Though you can still see the LOD line right ahead of you, it's not so noticeable that it ruins the fantasy. It's subtle, not stark. In locations such as Inca, players get a good dose of rain effects. The rain pours down on the windshield, i.e. the TV screen, and the road boasts solid dirt, mud and puddles of water reflecting the environment. Streaks of water reflect from long lines of muddy grooves, creating variegated. And in Arctica, players find themselves distracted by the flickering, glinting sunlight coming off the snowy mountainous surfaces. While the special effects are excellent, a few could have been dropped, such as the stupid tourists snapping photos and the useless fireworks shooting off at check points. The car deformation is excellent, though it's not as extensive as in V-Rally 3. But the cars show off race drivers in the car, shifting and steering, and the car models are high with thousands of polygons. The menus are sleek and easy on the eyes, too.The game boasts a good selection of textures too. Progressing through the C class to the B and A classes, players will notice similar courses swapping texture palettes and changing entirely in look. The crowds all look respectable and numerous objects are breakable and smashable on the course, such as cacti, road signs and even chickens. Also, a respectable set of replay shots can be seen, but you cannot change them manually, which is a bit of a shame.SoundLight rock best describes the tunes players hear in the replay and menu sections of this game. As per most rally games, Rally Fusion doesn't include music during races, instead focusing on a deep range of engine sounds and the voice of your occasionally maniacal co-pilot. Perhaps the most amusing of all co-pilots, this one calmly states the upcoming turns in degrees and length, but when you incur too much damage or flip the car his reactions are off the hook! I could have sworn he swore at me, and he called me ~Idiot,~ and derogatory things of that nature. I quite enjoyed it.If you like arcade-style rally games, then Rally Fusion: Race of Champions is your bag. The great selection of courses and challenges is truly enjoyable, giving gamers a sampler of many kinds of racing styles. The car list is exemplary, though you'll be wiping your brow in relief once past the undesirable Class C cars (most of them, anyway). But if you're looking for a deep sim with loads of alterations, modifications and real-life activity, well this is not your game. Still, Rally Fusion is a solid racer, and a decent rally title with some special and memorable sections.", "date": "Nov 12, 2002"}
