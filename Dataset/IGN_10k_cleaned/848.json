And now look at what it has done. NFL Blitz, Ready to Rumble, and now the return of the Gauntlet. Gauntlet Legends stands as symbol of the company's former and renewed self. Gauntlet Legends, the second in the series, brings back the simple slash-happy wanderings of wizards, warriors and archers, and valkyries to PlayStation, with a one- to two-player option and a slew of levels, power-ups, and monsters to slay.   Gameplay After having seen a major delay, we're glad to see that Gauntlet Legends finally arrived on PlayStation. For those not familiar with Gauntlet Legends, the arcade version is a one- to four-player game. It brings a fantastic communal aspect to the aspect of arcade gaming, as all players are meant to cooperate to reach the final goal (to collect everything possible and kill all the bosses). Usually, personalities are fleshed at the cabinet, and where once total strangers were just looking blankly at each other, they're now helping each other out, working as a team, and slashing baddies together. In an age where Doom is tagged as a ~murder simulator~ (and for the record, that label is blind, extremist propaganda), politicians can look at Gauntlet Legends to see how a fun and violent game builds friendships in a different -- not better or worse -- way than those in first-person shooters.   Unnecessary politics aside, Gauntlet Legends for PlayStation does a few things differently than its Nintendo 64 and arcade brethren. It retains some, but not all, of the communal fun that the others contained because it's only a two-player game. With two players the game is still fun, and you still find those moments of disagreement and compromise of who takes the gold or who takes the ham, but the frenzied chaos of the three and four player games is lost. The chaos is dampened, and so is the fun.   If you only own a PlayStation, and you love arcade-style hack-and-slash adventures such as Golden Axe or Dungeons and Dragons, then the game still has enough redeeming values to keep it fun and entertaining for quite while. First and foremost is that it's huge. With 20 levels to play through, a single player literally has dozens of hours of game time.  You start out with one area, peppered with weak monsters, and easy-to-find Obelisks, and as you progress to the next areas, the AI gets more fierce, and the levels more complex.   The best thing about Gauntlet is the bountiful quantity of secrets and extras. Four secret areas exist within the 20 levels, and each rewards you with a secret character, if you can beat it in the required time limit. Also, in each regular area, players have a huge list of weapons, spells, keys, and food items, to collect. The Spells themselves are fun on their own to collect. They include the Three Way shot, Fire Breath, Thunder Hammer, Invulnerability, Invisibility, and the Phoenix Familiar. Special weapons include the Ice Axe of Untar, the Flame of Tarkana, The Scimitar of Rasha, and the Marker's Javelin.   Don't forget the Rune Stones. With 13 Rune Stones in all, players are almost assuredly going to return to a level to find the Rune Stone, in order to open up yet another secret level to face the ultimate boss. These can be harder to find then you think.   But again, while the replay value of the game is truly remarkable, at its heart, Gauntlet Legends is at very minimum, a two-player game. The bosses are the best examples of this sensibility. You simply hack and slash at them until they die, or until you die again and again. The game's arcade nature is really obvious here, as you simply press start again to regenerate your life and then hack at the boss to eventually destroy it. Fighting a boss ultimately requires at another player for it to be interesting in the least. Four players would have been better.   Graphics Visually, this game looks remarkably different than either the arcade or the Nintendo 64 versions. It's got a strange, FMV look to it that's off-putting. It works, and the game moves and plays fine, but it's odd, even funky. The best example of this is the way the character moves around on the ground, and interfaces with objects in the environment. It's like he's in front of a blue-screen and is not quite in the game. He or she never seems to be walking on the ground proper, but just inches above it. The sharp edges and crisp look differs even from the arcade game (which has a PC engine), and are a little off-putting, too.   As with all of the versions, when a group of characters appear on the screen, slowdown occurs. It just happens, and while it sucks, no version escaped the slowdown.   The level of detail and clarity of the characters also appears slighted. Characters appear smaller and busier when you look at their particulars (clothes, faces, etc.), and the enemies own the same discrepancies. If you have never seen Gauntlet Legends, you may notice these things. But if you have already seen it, you instantly see the difference, and it's annoying.   Sound When a game like this has such a simple premise, the graphics and sound usually follow in line. Some special games break that mold, but not Gauntlet Legends. Which is not to say the music isn't good, it suits the game perfectly. The gallant roaming spirit of the game is well represented in the music, and it never gets in the way or is too far in the background, so works out just right.   As for the sound effects, especially the voices, well, that's not quite the case. These creatures and warriors all sound as if they were talking through a warp tunnel. Their voices are muted and dulled. Strange and weird, but true. If you have all of the systems, than you should get the Nintendo 64 version. If not get this one, you'll enjoy it, especially with a friend.", "date": "Apr 8, 2000"}
