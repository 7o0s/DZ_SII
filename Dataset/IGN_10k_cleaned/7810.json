After movies like Toy Story and Finding Nemo transformed from interesting concepts to proven blockbusters, Hollywood studios saw dollar signs and green-lighted any and every computer animated feature in the works. Some of these efforts turned out to be pretty good. Ice Age and Shrek, for instance, were so successful that both spawned sequels. But others well, not so much. A Shark's Tale isn't likely to be remembered in a couple of years, even if the usually golden Will Smith voiced the main character. Neither, unfortunately for publisher Midway, is Happy Feet, a movie with enough star power to fill five movies, but decidedly slim on story or, for that matter, lovable characters. Now, Midway has brought a videogame take on the movie to the small screen and it is very clearly designed exclusively for kids, most of whom will probably grow bored with the affair after they discover that there are only three basic level types that repeat themselves over, over and over again.  Happy Feet, which is available for a variety of platforms, from PlayStation 2 and GameCube to Wii, is very much a companion piece to the movie. So in other words, if you or your kids adored the story as it unfolded in theaters, you might want the take-home experience on your videogame system of choice, too. Years ago, kids' games were cheaply made and shoveled out the door quickly in order to earn a quick buck, but developers are trying a little harder nowadays. Take, for example, the Eurocom-created Ice Age 2, a charming and funny platformer that we can safely recommend as fun for both younger and older players. In stark contrast, Happy Feet is for kids or for nobody - a truth that is evident from the very first overly simplified gameplay scenario unravels. Skewing young is not necessarily a bad thing, but Happy Feet is unfortunately not an exceptional or even a very good kids' effort, either.    You play as Mumbo, a dancing penguin who finds himself something of an outcast when his operatic friends and family learn that he has a terrible singing voice. The game's story is told through a series of adequate real-time cut-scenes. Although the majority of A-list celebrities steered clear of the videogame, sound-a-likes do a very believable job of replicating the characters from the movie. Midway's Robin Williams sound-a-like is particularly good - his delivery is actually funny in most cases. What the game doesn't replicate, however, is the charm of the admittedly less-than-spectacular film. The animation nuances and the believable world of the movie are replaced by stiffly realized models and sparse 3D environments, which is a disappointment.        The gameplay mechanics are so simple and shallow that they can be learned and mastered simultaneously. There are three templates, none of them especially inspired. You've got the DDR-style dancing levels where you use the controller to tap left, right, up or down in conjunction with on-screen arrows; the Wii version of Happy Feet is a little more engaging because it makes use of the remote for gesture-based actions. Even so, the very easy nature of the dance challenges makes them almost impossible to lose and therefore unrewarding even when bested. Meanwhile, you've got penguin sledding levels and penguin swimming levels, both of which are similar. Although Midway has attempted to diversify levels by including a few unique items, such as speed boosts and destructible obstacles, the mechanics nevertheless feel reused and repetitive after only a handful of stages whiz by. Again, the Wii version presents slightly more exciting challenges due to the inherent control differences of the console. You tilt the remote on its side and simply rotate left and right to steer Mumbo through the environments. It's a novelty for a minute or two, but after that there's little more to hold your attention for very long.  We don't mean to suggest that the play mechanics are broken or unsatisfactory. Actually, what's there works well and we even found ourselves moderately enjoying some of the sledding areas. That said, this stuff doesn't do anything beyond the ordinary and there are frankly much better kids' games out there. We hate to keep bringing Ice Age 2 up, but hey, if you want a smart and charming platformer that's also set in a snowy environment, go with Vivendi's game.   Happy Feet's presentation squeaks by with passable visuals and audio, some areas better than others. The 3D penguin models look decent even during up-close zooms, but animation is stiff, not fluid. There are some extra bells and whistles like the aforementioned destructible objects and some well-implemented particle effects that complement the environments. However, textures blur up close and amazingly the framerate occasionally dips during high-speed sledding, too. Furthermore, the title supports neither a 16:9 nor 480p mode, even on Wii, which is just sloppy.Happy Feet as a videogame very much mimics the movie in that it falls well short of expectations. While the title does feature the same story and characters as its silver screen counterpart, it lacks the charm. The basic gameplay mechanics are incredibly simple and they repeat so often that the action is doomed for monotony. The end result is an experience that teeters on the mediocre. Yes, your four-year-old might find something to like here, but there are far better kids' games on the market. Unless you or your child is a Happy Feet fanatic, and I can't imagine that someone like this even exists, keep moving because there's very little to see here.", "date": "Dec 12, 2006"}
