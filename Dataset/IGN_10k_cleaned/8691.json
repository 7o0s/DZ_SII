Handheld gaming gives you the unique opportunity of playing games on the go. Simple. Therefore, if you've got a PSP you can theoretically speed through the streets in a Porsche while slouching in the back of a black cab, shoot down bogies during a leg-crunching Ecomony flight across the Atlantic and, if you ever played one of those odd Japanese train driving sims from Taito, drive the 11.57 to Osaka while riding the Northern line. But what about SBK-07 Superbike World Championship '07? It's one of only a few handheld biking games but is it really possible to clock up a decent lap while riding shotgun on the back of your mate's Honda? Sadly not, unless you want to break all your limbs when you fall off the back. However, it probably would make this disappointing bike sim more interesting than it really is.   The 'arcade' controls make it enjoyable for beginners.  You see, we enjoyed the PS2 version of SBK. It was fast, the controls were responsive and, more importantly, it gave the players the feeling that they really were buzzing along on two wheels. For this PSP conversion, however, developer Milestone - previously responsible for EA's Superbike series - has gone off course. The sense of intense speed and tight controls that made the PS2 game so compellingly addictive and exciting have all but gone, resulting in a lacklustre racing experience.   But before we race ahead of ourselves let's start with a few hard facts. Firstly, Superbikes is a different sport entirely to MotoGP, so don't go embarrassing yourself in front of your motorsport-loving mates. In MotoGP the bikes they race are specialised racers built for the track, whereas the crotch rockets in Superbike are road-legal and are the same as the ones you can buy in a shop, albeit with the odd tweak and enhancement. While World Superbike isn't as big as MotoGP it's certainly a fast-growing sport and while the name James Toseland will mean nothing to the majority of us, anyone with the slightest interest in bikes will be pleased to learn that the UK biker - and indeed many of the other riders, teams and tracks - are in the game.   If that biker was doing a wheelie, this shot would be better.  So now you've had time to familiarise yourself with the world of Superbikes let's look at the action. Much of the game is played out in the Championship mode, which is a comprehensive Superbike experience that includes pre-match warm-ups, practice laps, time trials and the actual race itself. In addition you're free to tweak the set-up of the bike between races, ensuring there's just as much off-track action as there is riding for those who want something suitably in-depth.     Having said that, the Championship mode is immediately accessible for anyone that isn't already a Superbike fan too. Indeed, the arcade control setting allows even the most uncoordinated rider a decent run of the track, thanks to a whole load of driving aids that take care of the braking and essentially guide you around the track. As your skills improve these aids can be switched off one by one, so  things never get so easy the challenge wears thin.   Superbike fans are likely to appreciate all the official bikes.  Alongside the Championship is the standard racing game line-up up of a Quick Race mode, time trial, a race weekend (one event, including the pre-stages) and finally the Challenge mode. This is the most notable mode on offer because it sets you different tasks to complete, such as racing through checkpoints at a certain speed or only using your brakes for a set period of time. However, while they're fun to begin with and are without doubt a great way to master advanced driving techniques, many of the challenges are unforgiving and therefore playing them quickly becomes frustrating. Having to restart because you clip the edge of the grass is tedious, especially when it's only the very edge of your tyres that strays off the track, but this kind of thing happens time and again in the challenge mode.   And as if things weren't hard enough already, the game is made unnecessarily tricky by the loose controls. In the PS2 game you always feel in command of your speed machine, so you could quickly counter over-steer or adjust your bike to squeeze through a narrow gap in the pack. That's not possible here because the analogue nub and D-pad simple aren't responsive enough. Gliding around a hairpin is impossible because any kind of precision control is missing, so you end up zig-zagging around bends rather than drifting smoothly through the apex. The camera doesn't help either - it often flickers as you round a bend, which can be off-putting when you're hurtling along at 150mph.   Sadly SBK lacks any real sense of speed and thrills.  But perhaps SBK's biggest problem is that, apart from the occasional wheelie, it's really not that exciting. Graphically it's instantly forgettable, its dull grey tracks and blocky trackside enough to make you reach for the power button. The bikes hardly look like the high-octane road monsters either, which they did in the PS2 game. Instead they lack detail and are poorly animated, plus they don't really rocket along. Nope, riding one of these 'powerful' two-wheelers feels more like a Sunday drive than a balls-out thrill ride, and in our book that's the biggest sin any racing game can commit.Theres no denying that SBK-07 is a competent superbike simulation  its got the licensed teams and tracks and Championship mode is bursting with depth. However, the controls just are twitchy or responsive enough, plus theres no great sense of speed as you zip around the tracks. Sure, you can do wheelies and there are plenty of options for Superbike fans to get their teeth stuck into  such as bike customisation and all the engine tinkering  but overall SBK-07 is a racing game that never shifts out of third gear.", "date": "Jun 26, 2007"}
