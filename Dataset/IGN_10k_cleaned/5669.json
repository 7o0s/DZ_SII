{"name": "Aquarium Pets", "name_review": "Aquarium Pets", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/04/07/aquarium-pets", "text": "Aquariums, the staple of dentist offices across the nation, provide a soothing solace. You can literally lose yourself watching the seemingly peaceful existence of the fish beyond the glass case, sometimes with wonder -- sometimes with envy. Centerscore attempts to recreate this aquatic distraction with their new Aquarium Pets, a half-game, half-screensaver.   Aquarium Pets turns your mobile screen into a virtual aquarium, complete with the ability to tap on the glass and get the attention of the inhabitants inside. The game unfolds over a series of missions that involve feeding, breeding, and the death of your watery pals (which is somewhat morbid). It's a game to be enjoyed strictly at your leisure. There is no overwhelming need to clear the screen of blocks or diffuse a bomb. Sometimes your goal is as simple as watch the fish eat. And it's a nice change of pace -- to a point.   Breeding plays a large part in Aquarium Pets. There is a store where you can buy several varieties of fish, but through breeding, you can create a massive number of different, unique fish. The more oddball the fish is, the more it is worth to the pet store. Selling your fish is the best way to not only build up a little bank, but also prevent your tank from getting as crowded as lower Manhattan.   Aquarium Pets is an attractive little game. The fish swim innocently around the screen (save for the killers), looking for food and love during their short time on earth. Talk about yer metaphors.Aquarium Pets is a groovy little non-game that caught my attention for longer than I figured it would. The level of interactivity is fairly low, which might be a turn off for some players, but watching your fish friends float around is a pretty decent way to spend a subway ride if you forgot the morning paper. Centerscore is on to something with this little game/non-game. If they haven't invested in a Nintendo DS development kit, I recommend they do.", "date": "Apr 7, 2005"}
