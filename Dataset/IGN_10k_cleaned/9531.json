Ultra-fast cars, shattered glass, and righteous explosions in crowded intersections is just too much for the current generation of handsets to handle, so EA Mobile boiled the game down to the essentials -- causing basic mayhem and running cars into ruin.   I'm leading with this to appropriately set up expectations because Burnout has the potential to disappoint its hardcore fanbase. The way EA constructed mobile Burnout certainly proves that the publisher knows the mobile audience. Hardcore gamers might check this out with curiosity, but EA knows the majority will turn up their noses. So why try to cater directly to that crowd when this game is likely to be consumed by players that truly get the casual scene?   Burnout actually is more of a duel game than an all-out crash-a-thon. From a top down view that will remind many gamers of the classic Spy Hunter, you zip around the screen and dish out damage to the lone rival car on-screen. The road always remains a lengthy straightaway, but don't let that lull you into thinking its a cakewalk. (Cake-drive?) There's no shortage of obstacles, such as overpass pillars, debris, and basic traffic to complicate the many missions that make up Burnout's solid career mode.   Across the three different environments, players engage in four events. My favorite, by far, is the king of the road. You must battle it out with a rival car to spend the majority of the race time inside a circle in the center of the highway. The rival car will try to push you not only out of the circle, but also into obstacles, which you must also avoid while maintaining dominance. It almost plays out like the quick-reflex puzzle game, which is very cool indeed.   The other events are a mixed bag. The survival race is a tad dull since you're simply trying to avoid demolition via a rival car. The sequence that assigns you to traffic duty -- you must crash as many normal cars as possible without wrecking -- is passable. Better is the mission that asks you to smash as many rival cars as possible during a quick highway run. So, an enjoyable two out of four missions isn't that bad, eh?   There are a handful of hooks straight from the console series, such as the bronze through gold medals awarded for exemplary performance. Your rank as a highway maniac is also rated. You also have the classic boost meter, filled by smashing rivals and daring traffic feats. You also earn extra cars for reaching each new environment.    Burnout does a commendable job creating a real sense of speed. You really do rip down that highway, and mercifully, the tight control lets you keep up with the action. And even though the game does blaze across your screen, you still have ample opportunity to appreciate the nicely detailed, colorful stuff happening on this blood- and gad-soaked stretch of freeway.  Back-handed compliment time: Burnout on mobile is not the disaster I was expecting. In fact, the game shows really how thoughtful EA Mobile was when bringing the bestselling racing franchise to the smallest screen. I didn't really care for two of the four events (which is  technically half of the game), which brings the score down. But don't let that 7 scare you off completely. There's some really good stuff in here and I think with a little work, the sequel could be unstoppable.", "date": "Nov 15, 2007"}
