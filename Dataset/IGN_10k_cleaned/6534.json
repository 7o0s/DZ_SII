This week, I've been revisiting my ~middle~ gaming years with SEGA Mobile's amazing port of their 16-bit Genesis classic. Smashing almost an entire Genny cart into a single cellphone download is something of a marvel, and even though there are some corners cut to get the job done, there is just no way around the fact that this mobile game is of a certain qualitie.   The game is an absolute hallmark of platforming, a game genre that has taken a beating on today's top consoles (no thanks to a gaming populace that generally turns its nose up at most things 2D), but really reached its pinnacle in the 16-bit generation. And next to Mario, there is no video game character that has such an incredible Q rating. Sonic moved systems in ways that games like God of War and Kameo could only hope.   SEGA walked a precarious tightrope when it decided to bring Sonic to mobile -- there are so many fans intimately familiar with the Blue Blur's adventures that they would be able to smell an impostor from a parallax scrolling mile away. Anything less than a great port of Sonic's debut would have been rejected, such is one of the few drawbacks of success.   Sonic the Hedgehog manages to faithfully recreate eighteen stages of blazing running and jumping, from the Green Hill Zone to the Scrap Brain Zone and all the day-glo levels in between. I didn't bust out my Genesis to double-check the absolute authenticity of tree placement or loop size, but everything felt natural. Things that I remembered, such as secret bonuses hidden in palm trees that reveal themselves if you jump in the right spot or the way platforms sink into lava rivers, felt just as I left them. Enemy placement didn't seem as plentiful, but I could be mistaken on that front.   But if SEGA Mobile did strip out some enemies, the reasoning for doing so is sound. The screen-size doesn't show off as much of the level as you might need if plotting an end-run through a collection of rings en route to the stage's end. And since controls are handled by the thumbpad or numberpad, which is admittedly not as responsive as the Genesis controller (you press up to jump, for example), the last thing I'd want is an armada of enemies stripping me of my rings every fifteen seconds. It takes a few moments to get used to the way Sonic controls, but once you have the feel for running and jumping -- spinning into enemies to free them from Robotnik's (before his Eggman moniker became universal) wrath -- the game feels good.   Sonic is all about speed, and thankfully, this mobile port is able to deliver on this front. It doesn't run as quickly as the original, but again, that's actually okay due to the smaller real estate. However, I cannot think of any mobile platformer that runs this fast without getting so blurry the game is render unplayable.    The soundtrack also survives the transition very much intact, with the level themes reasonably recreated for mobile. These are highly recognizable tunes, so if they were off even in the slightest, fans would revolt. Even the invincibility jingle was included. Now, because of the music, some of the sound effects aren't heard. But thems just the breaks right now until cellphone games are able to do true multi-channel audio.  I was expecting a huge disappointment when I downloaded Sonic this week -- porting one of the most recognizable games of the 16-bit generation on a handset (in this case, an LG VX8000) seemed like a rather daunting task. That, and even though SEGA has done almost everything in its power to dilute the brand, I still have much love for Sonic, especially his classic games. But Sonic the Hedgehog is a success. Fans will feel right at home, thanks to levels lovingly recreated and the sense of speed that truly defined the franchise. The corners cut didn't bother me in the least -- after all, this is a mobile game -- and I hope hardcore fans can look past them, too. If you are still a devotee to SEGA's mascot or just want an excellent platformer, download this game. Nice work, SEGA Mobile.", "date": "Dec 23, 2005"}
