Why are we here? Is there a god? Is there a whole gaggle of gods, each with a bad attitude and a bunch of mini-gods orbiting around them like little satellites? Why is Paris Hilton in the newsever? How is it that some games are allowed to reproduce?   Marine Sharpshooter 3 is the like-minded grandchild of a first person shooter released back in 2003 called, not surprisingly, Marine Sharpshooter. What is surprising is that version number 3 exists at all.   When the original appeared on the scene four years ago, it received a slightly less than lukewarm reception. It was regarded as repetitious and more than a little problematic, and a bit behind the times even for its low-cost ~budget~ stature. When Marine Sharpshooter 2 emerged approximately a year later, it was seen as marginally superior to the first but certainly not worthy of sincere recommendation.     Three years have since passed, more than enough time to modernize the game and perhaps deal with its shortcomings. Yet developer/publisher Groove Games has opted instead to stick with what didn't work the first two times and foist upon the innocent public a retro blast from the past, a retread, a reasonable facsimile of the original that now appears even less capable because we're now four years into the future.   Yet there's clearly a method to the madness. There's a claim right on the box that the Marine Sharpshooter series has sold more than a million (yes, a million) copies. If this is true, and we can only presume it is, what does it mean? It means gamers like to shoot stuff and particularly like to snipe stuffso much so that they'll grab virtually anything that allows them to do just that. It proves that budget games, at half the price of regular fare, have a formidable audience. And it proves that the same game can essentially be re-released over and over again, keeping things fresh only by updating the locale and the enemy.   For MS3, that enemy is Iranmore precisely, Iranian terrorists. Very topical indeed.   As a marine sharpshooter in Iran, it is your duty to go places where others fear to tread, taking your trusty partner, the spotter, along with you on your journey. Each of you is permitted a set number of weapons and devices, the main distinction being that the sharpshooter (sniper) generally brings a long-range rifle along with his pistol and grenades, while the spotter carries a short-range automatic weapon together with his pistol, smoke grenades, and high-powered scope.   When the twosome head into combat, the spotter typically starts the proceedings by taking a good long look around. Then the sniper picks off what he can from long range, before the spotter moves in again to finish up. What's cool about the whole thing is that the game allows you to switch control instantly between the two soldiers, so you can be the sniper one moment and the spotter the next. The other goes on autopilot.    What's not so cool is that the non-human-controlled soldier is an utter buffoon. Sometimes he'll follow you as he should, other times he won't. Sometimes he might open fire on the enemy to help you out, other times he doesn't. Sometimes he'll materialize, out of nowhere, only to perch himself right beside you and trap you on a stairwell or in a godforsaken room somewhere. Good thing then that he's invincible when in autopilot mode, because he constantly leaves himself wide open to be blasted by anyone who sees him goofily standing there. Chances are that even you'll take a few pot shots, just to vent your frustration. Yet you won't hurt him because, unlike the original game, MS3 won't let you.   But your bizarre compatriot is just one of a bushel of problems and ill-conceived concepts allowed to slip through. You can't, for example, fast-forward or skip through any of the cutscenes or mission introductions, no matter how many times you've seen them before. You can't ALT-TAB. You can't manually save your progressthe game instead makes hard saves only when you've reached the end of each mission.   Though it'll also save when you reach a checkpoint, checkpoint saves don't survive game shutdowns. Thusly, if you work your way carefully through the majority of a given mission, you'd damn well better complete it before you take a break or you'll be forced to start it all over again.    Fortunately, the art of the snipe is alive and well even in this otherwise forgettable game. There's just something about sneaking around like a chameleon, sourcing targets that seem to be several football fields away, and stealthily downing them with the aid of high-tech ocular equipment and long-range weaponry. In MS3, headshots are authentically more lethal than bullets to the body, and hunkering down close to the ground is the best way to minimize drift. Crouching is good, lying prone on the dirt steadies your aim completely. Moreover, you're far less obvious to the enemy when you're down there.   However, the game world is otherwise far more perilous than it should be. You may, for example, find yourself mysteriously glued to a ladder as you're trying to scale it. You may try to hide from an immediate onslaught behind a rock or in a cave, only to realize that MS3's invisible boundaries prevent you from doing so. In either case, your bullet-riddled corpse may well be the tragic end result.    If the bullets don't kill you, boredom might. The game quickly falls into a never-ending cycle of near-identical scenarios, played out in slightly different locales, wherein you check an overhead map of the situation, find the bad guys and eliminate them, and hit your checkpoints. At ~easy~ difficulty, if you are at all patient, MS3 is truly easy. Set the level to ~hard,~ and you'll quickly see the only real difference is in the number of enemies and the speed with which they locate you. ~Hard~ is hard, but not always for the right reasons.   Indeed, enemy AI is totally and completely perplexing. Some of them latch on to you like a horny schnauzer to your leg, turning immediately at the slightest hint of your presence and Swiss cheesing you with bullets before you've even raised your gun. Luckily for you, they usually stand there in full view rather than hiding behind anything, which makes your job a lot easier should you get off a shot. Others are blissfully unaware you're nearbyeven when they're standing right beside you. They will, however, yap away merrily, barking the same stale phrases over and over again, no matter what the situation. The background music is bearable, and the sound of weaponry is mostly believable, but the patter is insultingly random.      Adding to the misery is what you can't do with your bullets. You can't penetrate the side of a nylon tent with them. You can't shatter glass with them. You can't blow up a vehicle with them. Heck, you can't even blow up a vehicle with your grenades. Essentially, the scenery and the props remain unaffected by even the most ferocious firefights.   Moreover, you can't use stuff. You can't pick up a weapon from a dead guy. You can't open doors. You can't grab a rock and hurl it at someone. But you can shoot someone twice in the elbow and kill him. What the?    Visually, MS3 is not an ugly game. But it ain't pretty either. Everything seems cloaked in gray or green, and textures and lighting do little to visually distinguish items. We found the depiction of staircases to be particularly bad, simply because it's so difficult to differentiate one stair from the next. A vague fog cloaks everything more than a few hundred feet away, thus lightening the load on the game engine and keeping MS3 more claustrophobic than it should be. And those with high-resolution monitors will be sorely disappointed to know the game hits a maximum of 1280x980not nearly enough for today's latest big screen LCDs.   It seems somehow fitting that there's no multiplayer support, either cooperatively with your spotter partner, or head-to-head in full combat mode. That's too bad in one sense, because multiplayer sharpshooting may have been a saving grace. On the other hand, the lack of multiplayer theoretically means there's one less person subjected to the frustration of what is essentially a faulty, four-year-old budget title.Like America's Funniest Home Videos, Marine Sharpshooter keeps coming around again and again, flaunting the same underwhelming, low-budget material it's imposed upon us before. Yet it survives. That's a good thing in a way, because it proves that not every game needs to be a multi-gazillion-dollar Electronic Arts extravaganza to gain an audience. Yet this edition of the game is so far behind the times and so quirky that one has to wonder what that audience is. It should not be you.", "date": "Jun 8, 2007"}
