In case you haven't, they did that because they were in hell, and I think that they must have been informed that they were going to be forced to play Army Men: Air Tactics. I guess they just figured they'd take the easy way out. This game misses and annoys in so many ways I'm really not sure where to start, but as a stalwart professional, I'll try to suffer through the nausea that I experience when I think of this game and give you a review.  I guess it's easy enough to dive in with the first noticeable downfall: the graphics. The visuals and graphics in this game look as though they haven't been upgraded at all from the first Army Men game. The human world is more populated with things to give some scale to the army men, but this game looks like it could have been made for the Super Nintendo. It's ugly, choppy, full of bad animations, and basically offends my sense of ascetics. Risk II has much better graphics than this game for cryin' out loud, and it's a board game remake. Okay enough of that, the vein in my forehead has started to pulse again.  So if the graphics are so bad, then they must have made up for it in the gameplay right? You would think so, wouldn't ya? But the best innovation to the game is that there are little games available inside the main game such as air hockey and Go. Otherwise the game revolves around endless amounts of killing little soldiers, tanks, and terribly animated flying ill-tempered insects with lasers strapped to their heads.  The game occasionally calls for some little puzzles to be solved to complete a mission in the game, but they are painfully obvious and therefore about as fun to figure out as the setup to your VCR. I got no sense of accomplishment from finishing a level except to say, ~thank God I don't have to ever have to play that level again.~   All this is without even talking about how the actual helicopters control. Well, imagine driving a car around on a field of Crisco and you'll know about how simple and fun it is to control the helicopter well. I've also always thought that in games like this, when you see the little bullet pixels hit the bad guy, it should hurt him, but it took inordinate amounts of time to kill simple soldiers sometimes.  So if the graphics and the gameplay are so bad, the sound must be good right? By now you should know that the answer is no. Average to bad music and bad sound effects just manage to take the game one step further towards the coveted ~worst game I've ever played~ title. I'm sure Steve will try to fight me on this one and keep it squarely in the hands of Blaze 'n Blade but this should definitely be neck and neck with it. Basically the voice acting is the best part of the sound, and it's really cheesy and bad, which in all truth isn't a horrible thing in a game about fighting toys. But the fact that the rest of the game makes you forget that these little guys are supposed to be toys just ruins that effect.  What should be a cute game that lets you play with toys is really just an exercise in patience as you fight the urge to rip the CD out of the computer and break it. Let's just hope that 3DO finally figures out that this series should pass from our lives and to never whisper it's horrible name again. I can already see the ~next stunning Army Men game brought to life in a 3D RTS using the awesome power of the Force Commander engine!~ Barf.  -- Dan Adams", "date": "Apr 6, 2000"}
