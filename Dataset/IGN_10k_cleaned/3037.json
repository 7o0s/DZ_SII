{"name": "NBA Starting Five", "name_review": "NBA Starting Five", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/10/10/nba-starting-five", "text": "It's been a renaissance year for basketball games in 2002. Whether you're discussing NBA 2K3's god-like approach to realism, NBA Live's intuitive right stick control feature, or NBA ShootOut's immersive career mode, the bar has been raised for any title that follows them. So elite is the choice that gamers need make in todays already packed market, picking the one edition that deserves your fifty bucks is as difficult a task as choosing a new car (albeit on a somewhat smaller scale).   ~Which title gives me the most for my money?~ is a question that we've seen in excess over the last few weeks, and one that several editors have been toiling over here at the office as well. As difficult a decision that it may be, one thing we can guarantee you is that NBA Starting Five is not among them.   Show-Off  The feature set is acceptable enough with all the options and extras that the casual gamer could hope for. Exhibition and Quick Start are self-explanatory methods to play against the computer or a friend in a game of one-on-one, while the Season and Playoff modes allow you take your favorite team to the championship through 82 hard-fought games. Trades and Free Agents are in there too, and there are plenty of post-season awards that can be earned for prosperity (including MVP, Rookie of the Year, Defensive Player, Sixth Man, and more). And just for good measure, Konami Osaka has even seen fit to throw in a Franchise feature and the standardized Create-A-Player editor we've come to know and love over the years.   As you can see, the meat of the options are actually quite hearty and match up well with any other basketball title on the market. Where the problem lies however, is in the actual execution of those features. It's almost as though the development team stopped optimizing its code at some point, and then slipped it by the quality assurance guys before they could notice.   Specifically, Starting Five is just plain full of bugs, anomalies, and other issues that seriously take away from the extras. You can for instance, create your very own persona and draft him onto the team of your choice but that process will most likely take you in upwards of 30-40 minutes. Not because of how many alterable attributes there are per character mind you, but because of the horrendous load times. Apparently giving priority to the music over the textures for new faces and heads, there are times when you will find yourself waiting for at least a minute when trying to find a look-alike for yourself --Seriously. When you take into account that there's almost 20 combinations of head and face selections, that's a serious wait to do nothing more than create a make believe player.   Additionally, the A.I. used for simulations is way off. When simulating a few seasons with the Lakers, I was surprised to find my NBA Finals opponents to be the Toronto Raptors. Naturally, I swept the first three games and when I played them in the final game the result was a complete and utter joke. How did that team make it to the Finals to begin with? Resetting and trying again was just as ridiculous, Nets vs. Grizzlies? Are you kidding me?   Player trades were pretty bad too, as I was getting mismatched offers that just shouldn't happen. It doesn't matter what universe you live in, Jason Kidd for Dalibor Bagaric is a bad deal, and giving up Shaq for DeSagana Diop doesn't make much sense either. On the whole, the A.I. in both franchise and season mode, was seriously lacking.   Gameplay  Starting Five manages to get one aspect of the game completely right: the shooting percentage. Consistently in the low 50% scoring range, your players toss the ball like the real thing. Of course, there's a difference between simulating realism and actually experiencing it. So while it may be all fine and good that your baskets brick half the time you attempt them for sake of realism, it's not all that fun to play. After a bit of practice, you can get those scores up to 70% maximum which is a lot more enjoyable, but it takes quite awhile before you can accomplish that.   Part of the problem is that the game is far too heavy on defense. I've played numerous exhibitions (six-minute quarters) where there's a combined 30-40 blocks per game, and damn near 60-70 rebounds per side. What that translates into is a whole lot of moments where it's flat out terrifying to make a basket -- And these aren't just the good teams I'm talking about, this is for all teams. From Cleveland all the way up to Los Angeles, your 6'3~ guys will dominate the outside shot like they're nine feet tall (with play in the paint almost as gnarly). Similarly, three-point attempts rarely find their mark, and with two humans playing don't be surprised if you find it an accomplishment if you sink 3 the entire game between you.    Because of these mechanics, the best (only?) way to score is to drive up on the inside and become the lay-up and jam master. That too is difficult however, as the players all apparently move at the same speed when not using turbo and when it is used, it last for only a few seconds before becoming entirely depleted. What you're left with is a basketball game that forces you to the inside drive but penalizes you for attempting it. It's a frustrating experience to be sure.   Unfortunately, that doesn't end the caveat list in the least. When faced with other players in one-on-one match-ups, touching them is the same as running into a brick wall. You will literally stop in your tracks the second you hit another player before the game kicks in and realizes that you're no longer trying to rush the basket. At that point it switches to box up mode, and both the guy on defense and the man with the rock slow down and stare at each other for multiple seconds for no reason whatsoever.   Put in simpler terms, the gameplay is outdated. Stuck somewhere between Electronic Arts' Bulls vs. Lakers and Sony's original ShootOut, the simplicity of the mechanics and baffling defensive choices feel as though you're playing a game on your Sega Genesis and not a modern day console. In conjunction with load times that last between 70-90 seconds per game (not kidding, we timed it), NBA Starting Five wears out its welcome rather quickly.   One aspect of the game I did enjoy however, was its approach to free throws. Not overly elaborate like Sega's game or as simple as EA's, the trigger-based system works pretty well and is as complicated as this type of thing should get. A take of the Live version of the free throw method, the left and right triggers represent the left and right arms of the player. Tap each trigger a second time when they're in the appropriate spot and the toss is in. Simple, but not too simple, I liked this alternative style most thoroughly.   Graphics  Though NBA 2K3 can still claim the title for the most dominant visual performer on the court, Starting Five weighs in near the bottom of the pile. To its credit, the character models are good and sport a nice variety in details, but the animations that move them are way behind the times. Lumbering, almost lazy-looking motions dictate their every action and the one-frame movements of their faces are laughably bad.   At least the details are acceptable with a polygonal bench and moderately put-together crowd. Stadiums too are nicely rendered, and the occasional taunts between possessions are entertaining. It's not really a bad presentation (there's specialized intros and light shows to accompany each team), and at the very least beats out the aesthetically lacking ShootOut 2003 by a point or two.   Sound  Another area where the bug monster apparently shows its ugly face, the audio is a mixed bag. The crowds sound great and react like a real audience should, with the bouncing basketball taking its subtle supporting role very well. The beef however, is that of the announcers. Sometimes on, sometimes off, there are instances where there's absolutely no commentary at all for several minutes. Then out of nowhere, Al Albert pops in with a quick snippet of info before slinking off into the distance. --very strange, and not very impressive.It's a shame that Konami Osaka couldn't put together a more solid product than this. With a rich development history that includes the Perfect Striker series and the fan favorite Goemon franchise, they certainly have the talent to put something great together. Based on this latest basketball effort however, and the complete lack of competition it will provide for games like Live and NBA 2K3, it's time to either go back to the drawing board completely, or stick with what they do best and focus on Soccer. Only time will tell which road they travel.", "date": "Oct 10, 2002"}
