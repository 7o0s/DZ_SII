Also vying for the title are such stripped-down creations as Vib-Ribbon, Mort the Chicken, and perhaps Tomarunner or various members of the Simple 1500 series, although those should perhaps be disqualified on account of they're conceived from beginning to end with minimalism in mind.  Of course, that's not to say that Hop-a-Bout wasn't.  But I would be treading on uncertain ground if I were to come to any conclusions about the intent that led to Hop-a-Bout's creation.  Why, in this day and age, would someone want to make a hopping game?  That's what this is, after all.  You're a monster, and you hop.  About.  There are several things that affect the way you hop and threaten to prevent your unfettered hopping, but essentially you're still just hopping about.  As hopping games go, I think this is a good one, but before that the question arises as to whether there's really a market niche for this sort of thing...  Gameplay  Like I say, you hop.  Pick a Monster Rancher monster at the beginning of each game, and they'll mount their pogo stick at the beginning of one of the game's dozens of tracks.   The object is to get from one end of the track to the other within the time limit - they scroll forward in railed fashion from the starting line to the checkered finish zone.  In between, there are gaps in the track and other obstacles that you have to negotiate, varying the speed and direction of your hopping.  You can't prevent your forward progress, or affect how high your pogo stick springs.  You can only move left or right by adjusting your lateral velocity or control how fast you move forward.  And so it goes.  Kinks are thrown into the mix by a variety of special squares, which affect your life level, push you in one direction or another, add or subtract from your timer, and so on. Some levels are composed of nothing but special squares, so you have to hop carefully to avoid unpleasant effects.  Those levels also provide considerable opportunity for developing combo bonus points, though - each special square you hop on adds one to your string, and points to your top score.  What's the point of this, in the end?  Well, after each series of levels, you earn some sort of prize, which is stored in your monster's rucksack, but...then what?  Hop some more, I suppose.  This is a basic twitch challenge with emphasis on the basic - the original Mario Brothers was arguably a more complex concept than this, and game design evolved well beyond Hop-a-Bout's level early in the NES age.  And it just goes on and on and on.  There's a course editor that lets you create your own tracks, but given the number of tracks already built into the game, which I believe tops 100, and the limited nature of the game, you're not likely to be able to come up with anything very special in it.  Graphics  Hop-a-Bout is rendered entirely in realtime 3D, but it's not going to win any prizes for innovation in visual design.  The pogo-sticking monsters have a very limited range of animation, just a few different types of special power-up hops and a couple of win poses.  The stages are all flat as a pancake, the same width each time, and composed out of little individual tiles, without a single diagonal line in evidence, let alone an actual curve.  Nothing is done to hide draw-in, the track merely disappears into the horizon near the top edge of the screen.  The textures for the tiles are very basic, and while the monsters are a step up relatively speaking, they're nothing that hot to look at either.  Sound  Boing, boing, boing...  Then there's the strange disturbing kazoo music with the banjo riffs, and other fifties-vintage bouncing happy stuff.  I suppose this is a perfectly appropriate soundtrack for a hopping game, and I've definitely heard game music I like less, but I expect those possessed of slightly less bizarre taste than I won't like this very much at all. I'm all for old-school arcade action, but Monster Rancher Hop-a-Bout sits at the very ragged-edged limit of what a publisher ought to expect more than, say, 15 bucks for.  Consider the fact that you could take that same thirty dollars, drop by a reasonably-priced retailer of used games, and likely walk out with something like Super Mario Bros. 3, Yoshi's Island, or Dynamite Headdy, along with a console to play it on.  If you already had an NES, SNES, or Genesis, you could get a fistful of classics for that kind of money and probably be holding several times as much platforming replay value in your hands as you could get from Hop-a-Bout.I find it difficult to slam Hop-a-Bout outright, although in truth I probably ought to, simply because I can't bring myself to hate something this quirky.  A fault in my personality, perhaps.  99 out of 100 of you are likely to feel cheated by this one, though.", "date": "Nov 29, 2000"}
