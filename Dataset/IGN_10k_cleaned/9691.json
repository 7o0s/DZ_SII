Following on the heels of Chuzzle, PopCap's first self-published mobile endeavor, Bookworm inches onto cellphones fully retaining everything that made it such a monster hit on PCs.   Bookworm challenges players to pull words out of a field of random-looking letter tiles. It looks not entirely unlike somebody dumped a few bags of Scrabble tiles on the screen. Using a cursor, you forge a trail through the tiles any which way you can to assemble words. The only catch is that the letter tiles must be adjacent -- you cannot just randomly grab letters from the field and score a seven-letter-word smash. After fashioning a word, the tiles vanish and new ones drop into the field.   (Alternately, you can use your number pad to spell out words as you see them, but I vastly preferred using the cursor.)   The larger or more complex the word, the more points you earn. Points are represented as books in the titular Bookworm's library. When you fill a shelf, you're on to the next round. Occasionally, point multipliers appear in the field that. These letter tiles, decked out in gold and sapphire, send your score into the lower stratosphere. Should the puzzle board stump you, you can shake it and hope the resulting formation gives you easier access to forming words.   After a few rounds, Bookworm introduces burning tiles. These tiles appear from time to time, especially if you've been skating on three-letter-words. Each time you form a word, the burning tile drops one space. If it reaches the bottom of the field, the game ends. To dispel the tile, you must use it in a word.   The rhythm of the game is exceptional -- and exceptionally addictive. After getting the hang of things with a few four-letter-words, you really get the hang of checking out the surrounding tiles of letters in hopes of seeking out some magical chain. Sometimes a ~th~ leads only to ~the.~ Other times, if you're lucky, it leads to ~thyroid~ with a bonus multiplier in there somewhere. There is a real sense of accomplishment after fishing a fifty-cent word out of the chaos beyond a little eyebrow raising from Lex, the game's bespectacled mascot.   Bookworm includes two modes. Classic play just lets you hover over the letter field in hopes of grabbing words -- you get to operate at your own pace, save for those falling fire tiles after finishing up a word. Action, on the other hand, turns the game into a lightning round. Burning tiles wade into the field at regular intervals and drop one space down every few seconds. You have to be fast with word conjuring in order to survive. I preferred Classic myself, as I had more fun going after bigger words rather than racing against an invisible clock.   I tested the game on a RAZR V9. The game looks good, but the most important thing is that the letter tiles are completely legible. After that, details like the growing bookshelves and the expressive Lex are just gravy.Bookworm is one of the casual publishers' biggest hits, spawning the superlative Bookworm Adventures. But until that RPG-esque treasure lands on the smallest screen, Popcap fans must make due with the original. Fortunately, that is hardly a bitter pill to swallow, as Bookworm remains a wonderfully engaging word game that vocabulary fans will savor.Wow. There's so much good stuff on mobile right now, friends. And great entertainment like Bookworm here isn't going to break your bank, either.", "date": "Dec 5, 2007"}
