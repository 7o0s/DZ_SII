{"name": "Worms: Armageddon", "name_review": "Worms Armageddon", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/12/17/worms-armageddon", "text": "The idea behind Worms is just short of ingenious. You take militant little Annelids that look utterly harmless, and arm them with modern weapons of destruction, teach them mystical Asian fighting skills, and pit a can-full of good guys vs. a jar-full of bad guys and watch them pulverize each another 'til kingdom come. Somehow moms don't get mad about the violence, because they are just stubby, little, pink worms after all, and you get to cause major destruction on the PlayStation and watch Worms fly through the air, blow, up, explode, and drown.   What could be better? The PC version.   Gameplay, Graphics, The Kitchen Sink... Worms Armageddon is the third Worms game to rally kids and teenagers together in the battle of the little guys versus the little guys. The concept really hasn't changed much since day one, and this third incantation only varies in its overall visual design than anything else. Yes, there are little differences. Lots of them, but the game is essentially the same. Worms vs. worms on hundreds of different landscapes with more than 50 different weapons, and a learning curve that is easy for some and difficult for others. But the action, humor, and random qualities intertwine wonderfully to create a thoroughly entertaining game.   Here is a typical gameplay scenario: Your little stubby worm is down to 15 health points, and the two baddies to your left are at 50 health points. They are on a ledge hanging above the ocean. You simply take out your bazooka and shoot them to bits. They won't just take the damage, they'll take the impact and fling mercilessly into ocean and die. You even get to see them gulping for air as they sink to the ocean bottom. Isn't that sweet? Believe it or not, somehow no matter how much pain is inflicted, these little worms remain cute and loveable (and dangerous and lethal and ruthless, and...). It's a heck-of-a good game concept.  Worms Armageddon for the PlayStation isn't simply a port, however. Graphically, the game is the same, with a few exceptions. The lower resolution creates a fuzzy, unclear look to the game, but this doesn't affect what is essentially simplistic, cartoon graphics that aren't terribly detailed to begin with. But the numbers are harder to read, and even the little text boxes seemed to have grown smaller and harder to read, too. The game's mix of military beats and ethereal atmospheric sounds are the same as the PC version, and the only other change is the introductory cinema, which is now more campy and silly.   In terms of straightforward gameplay, it is 99% the same as the PC version. With 60 different weapons, and more than 40 different single player missions, not including the training levels, Worms does have a lot to offer. And if you love Worms so much that you have it on the PC and still want it on your PlayStation, this version includes 10 exclusive PlayStation levels.   But I have two complaints. The first is my own. I had a hell of a time using the weapons properly both on the PC and the PlayStation. I simply couldn't judge the distances or the power that well, and more often than not I hurt myself more than the enemy did. That's just me not coping well, I guess. I can immediately adapt to almost every kind of game, but this one just took far too long. Some people have problems with games like Virtual On, Turok, or even Resident Evil. Not me. I have problems using the controls in Worms. But I know there are folks out there with the same problems.   Second, the controls of Worms were made even more difficult when they were remapped onto the PlayStation controller. It's now harder to control the individual weapons and move them around. That happens occasionally with PC-to-console ports, and I just didn't like this one at all. It works, I guess, for most people, but not for me.   Other than those two problems, one personal, the other more universal, the game is essentially the same as on the PC and on the Nintendo 64. It looks a little worse on PS, but it's all there. The recipe is still a good one, and it hasn't changed too much in this third try, so if you simply want more maps to battle on and weapons to use, then dig into this can of Worms Armageddon. For those who didn't like the first two and were hoping to play something wild and different, you're simply out of luck.  -- Douglass Perry", "date": "Dec 17, 1999"}
