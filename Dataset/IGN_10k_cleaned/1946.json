For explanations and a lot of laughs, you want to check out www.riceboypage.com, a lengthy and cruelly humorous roast of the import car modification subculture.  Particularly recommended is the shot of a ~turbo~ Ferrari 355, proving that some people's insecurity really does know no bounds.  The best thing about the Tokyo Xtreme Racer games is that they provide all the goofy macho fun of your own custom racers without any of the guilt caused by all that tawdry excess, not to mention any of the ridiculous expenditure of cash required.  Gran Turismo has greater simulation depth when it comes to tuning your car, and it's naturally a far better driving game all round, but TXR has that Armored Core vanity appeal, with all the painting and detailing and cosmetic modifications and neato decals and so on.  Tweak your car just how you like it and it's yours, something you can invest a little of your ego in.  This, in addition to the expansions added to the PS2 version of the game, helps make up for some of the series' endemic faults.  TXR will always be a bit of an acquired taste, with its quirky drift mechanics, inexplicable collision behavior, and above all the potential for monotony inherent in a continuous string of highway drag races, but Zero does the best job of overcoming those problems and delivering a well-rounded racing experience.  GT3 is still the king, but TXR makes a cracking giant-exhaust-cone-bedecked court jester.  Gameplay  If nobody's ever bothered to explain the TXR concept to you before (unlikely, since this site alone has probably done so three or times already, but this primer remains obligatory), it's a head-to-head racing game using fighter-style energy bars.  You find and choose an opponent by wandering around the freeway until you meet one, then flash your headlights to start the race.  Cue the appearance of the energy bars, and their gradual degradation, depending on who leads and who trails.  You lose energy for falling behind your opponent, and for crashing into walls or cars -- hence, speed and clean cornering are both rewarded.  Empty your rival's energy and walk away with victory points (and bragging rights).  Fall too far back and you lose, with nothing to show for your efforts and a back mark in your win-loss record.   The pace of most races is such that they'll last between 30 and 90 seconds, covering a short stretch of highway with perhaps one or two major curves, and you don't usually have to wait more than two minutes or so before encountering a new opponent.  Thus, the game never becomes very involving -- it's more like a big plate of racing hors d'oeuvres.  Everything comes in bite-sized chunks, and it's easy to switch back and forth between flavors.  In the Quest mode, where you work to build up your car and conquer the streets, you can race two or three opponents, clear out a stretch of highway, head on back to the shop to upgrade your car, and then pick a new section of the streets to challenge.  Whether this will grab you for the duration is an open question.  The Quest mode can last a VERY long time, with close to 400 opponents to challenge throughout the various parts of the city.  The game progresses by letting you unlock new stretches of highway as you defeat certain special opponents, the members of the ~13 Devils~ gang -- you begin with access to a single loop, and as you beat the Devils that inhabit that part of town, you unlock the next ones.  Eventually, the track becomes extremely large, especially in comparison to the short loop in the first game, but it's easy to ~hit the wall~ at certain points, where you've emptied an area of basic opponents and become very familiar with the course, but can't quite find and beat that one last Devil.  If you do get into the swing of things, though, and learn to appreciate the odd blend of sim control and arcade-style drift mechanics (TXR doesn't drive quite like any other game, but try and envision a slower, more sim-oriented Daytona or Super GT), Zero has plenty of replay value in its selection of opponents and its tuning system.  There are dozens of cars in multiple classes -- all unlicensed, but with a striking resemblance to real-life rides.  Even my beloved Honda Beat is included, although it won't get you very far against serious competition.  Each car can be modified with a huge selection of performance and cosmetic options, including tons of aerodynamic widgets for your bumpers, fenders, side skirts, and spoilers, and you can individualize them with new paint jobs and stickers -- the game even individualizes you, giving you a nickname based on your racing performance.  Most entertaining of all, though, is the catalog of rival racers, each with hilariously-translated profiles.  I could spend hours just going through these and not racing at all.  Graphics  Zero is visually superior its closest Dreamcast counterpart, TXR 2, but players of that game will find Zero's look hauntingly familiar.  While the lighting has improved from almost all different sources (streetlights, headlights, and background elements), and the different character of the PS2's video out gives everything a crisper look (with bits of aliasing providing the downside), the look of the games are close enough that it takes time to notice the differences.    If visual quality is a bit of a tossup, the framerate issue is no contest.  Zero has hardly any of the slowdown that plagued TXR 2, in either split-screen or single-player modes.  You can get the game to chug if you really want to, but only in scenes with a lot of background detail and three or four cars moving, which are extremely rare and fleeting.  Other than that, it moves clean as a whistle, which naturally kills any flickering problems stone dead, since the game uses the system's full frame buffer.  Objectively speaking, Zero's a very good-looking game in almost all aspects.  It doesn't have the stunning realism of GT3, but it's an excellent expression of the slick, night-shrouded TXR style.  The cars have a much cleaner, realistic shine in comparison to the slightly garish reflection effects of the earlier Dreamcast games, and the amount of background detail offsets the somewhat monotonous character of the continuous night.  You travel around and through the skyline, across bridges and complex interchanges, and past the odd famous landmark here and there, including Tokyo Tower and what might be Genki's offices.  The city, like the cars, looks a little too smooth to be real, but in an aesthetically unified fashion.  The lights go a long way toward pulling everything together, whether they're the pools of illumination cast by streetlights, the blinding flare of a racer's headlights, the flickering road flares that outline an accident zone, or the pinpricks of light coming out of a skyscraper's windows.  The light works with what might otherwise be a relatively blandly textured world to add a great deal more life and variety to what you see.  Sound  What Tokyo Xtreme Racer needs most is a soundtrack to fill out its macho character.  If you've ever seen the anime Initial D (it's a variation on the street-racing theme, with mountain downhill drift racing instead of TXR's highway battles), that's the kind of sound I'm thinking of, heavy Avex eurobeat or something along similar lines.  The current soundtrack is plenty big, with about 30 tracks that you can mix and match with a playlist feature, but it just doesn't have enough guts.  It's all light rock, light techno, or a dull mixture of the two -- none of the chords or beats really get your blood moving.  Too bad, because the sounds of screeching tires would make excellent samples to mix with the main accompaniment.  The crash effects aren't that great (particularly in comparison to the beefed-up smashing noises in GT3), but you can still get a good feel for your car's behavior and surrounding through the sound effects.  There's also a cool Dual Shock vibration effect that mixes with the beat to simulate a heartbeat -- it starts thumping in time when the race is especially close.  A little trite, perhaps, but it's effective nonetheless. That goes for a good deal of the game, actually.  For me, at least, much of Tokyo Xtreme Racer's appeal is its emotional effect, rather than the objective quality of its gameplay.  Serious racing fans no doubt look askance at its driving mechanics, and I'm willing to bet that there's still a few holdouts who would complain that it's got only one track (which is true, admittedly, but just a little bit of a misrepresentation...).When it comes time to judge Zero's suitability as a purchase, then, it's worth contemplating whether it'll really hook your ego as well.  The previous installments in the series have proven capable of boring many gamers, and while Zero is better-looking and packs more features than either of those, it isn't enough of a departure to counter the fundamental complaints against its ancestors.  If you've just a little of Rice-Boy in you, though, and I'll freely admit that I do (even if my only means of personal transport is a bicycle), this game is the perfect outlet for that side of your personality.  If nothing else, it might keep you from doing such iniquitous things to your actual car...", "date": "May 30, 2001"}
