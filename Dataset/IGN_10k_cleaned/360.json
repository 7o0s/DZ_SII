It's frequently been the series that was high on concept but low on execution. In fact, after playing this game for what seemed an eternity, we were reminded of the words of former Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach John McKay, when asked what he thought about his 0-13 team's on-field execution.  ~I'm in favor of it,~ McKay quipped.  We hear you, John. Though we had guillotine in hand by the time we were done with Army Men: Toys in Space, we still realized that wasn't so much a bad game as it was a frustrating experience. Clever ideas and good intentions often shone through the cloudy interface and controls, almost making you like the game in spite of itself.   Almost.  Jumping into the game is familiar territory for those who've played the previous incarnations: You control green plastic army men most would remember fondly from childhood. The world around you is sized as it would be if you were a toy  giant soda cans and toilets are your obstacles; tan army men, ants, and toy-sized aliens are your enemies.  This time, Gen. Plastro, leader of the tan forces from previous games is still bent on universal domination, and now he's enlisted none other than an army of bug-eyed aliens to help his plan come to fruition. Luckily, as the game progresses, you'll team up with Tina Tomorrow and her space troopers, putting some space freaks on your side, too.  Most of the time, you are Sarge, leader of the green forces. As you progress through the maps, you pick up various weapons, from bazookas, to grenades, to flamethrowers, and can enter vehicles like tanks, jeeps and trucks. You'll also find other green forces to help you along, and can split them into units as you see fit. Clever touches are sprinkled throughout, too  players will be able use everyday objects that become killer weapons for a batch of toys. Bring out the giant magnifying glass to fry your enemies; flap the fly swatter down to teach those ants a lesson; or drop a baseball on the unsuspecting heads of an alien horde. Of course, the tan solider (and alien) enemies are similarly equipped and very deadly: almost impossible to kill at times without ridiculously superior firepower  and a new control scheme.  At its heart, Toys in Space is a boiled down RTS, with extra action thrown in for good measure. That's all fine and good, but because of that, we expect a certain measure of RTS controls that we're familiar with, or that at least aren't so convoluted and difficult to handle in the heat of battle. We often found our units slaughtered for the simple fact that we couldn't figure out exactly how to move or split our forces fast enough. With more time in the game, some of this difficulty dissipated, but not enough to ever make the game seem like it was set on anything but ~extra super-duper hard.~  Worse yet, while the game's top-down view offered some nice visuals of the flowerpots and picnic baskets that served as obstacles, the set pieces often didn't act as 3D objects. Many times, a path that looked clear under a flower petal or through a narrow passageway simply wasn't there, though your eyes told you it was. And we thought we left the invisible walls to our console brethren.  Of course, natural obstacles to completing your mission are always easier to accept than the sheer stupidity of your own men. Many times you'll rush into a battle situation and get your leader into a corner, only to have the rest of your men crowd in behind you like that marching band in the alley in the movie Animal House. Great, now you're a sitting duck for a bombing raid or a grenade-lobbing tan soldier, just because your unit is dumber than the plot of that Martin Lawrence movie, Blue Streak. Unit intelligence more advanced than the AI in the Magic 8-Ball might have been nice.  And then there are a few things that just plain don't work. While the manual and the training mission says you should be able to right click in front of the soldier or unit you're controlling to move them to a point, we never got it to work properly. The same thing happened when we tried to enter vehicles in the training mode, where we were told to right click over the tank, truck or jeep to make them enter  but it just wouldn't happen. Either we're game dyslexic, or there are some serious control/bug issues here.  The game does support multiplayer over Heat.net and MPlayer, which was a little more fun because we were able to rough up some real people with mines, grenades and giant magnifying glasses. But the same problems in the single-player left us without much desire to keep trying multiplayer battles.  It's a shame that so many stumbling blocks tripped up what could have been an entertaining game. Watching the little green and tan men battle it out with real weapons, calling in air strikes on those lousy aliens, and doing it all as a miniature solider in a world of larger-than-life everyday objects is genuinely a concept we'd like to play  if it was done right. The graphics here, while not amazing, are well-done for 2D, and the sound does a more than adequate job of putting you in the moment, with explosions, radio chatter and the screech of dying plastic soldiers. We kept playing, wishing the problems would just go away after the next level, thinking the concept was good enough to overcome the troublesome sloppiness.  But you can only grant a game so many mulligans before pushing the keyboard away in frustration and heading back to more productive activities, like watching TV or washing the cat. After the second time you get blocked in by your own unit's clumsy AI and can't move, after the fourth time you try to jump in a vehicle exactly as the instructions have described and still can't do it, you tend to offer less slack. And finally, when the rope is more taunt than a Baywatch star's abs, you're ready to tie the CD to the end of it and sling it out the window.  The odd thing is, the game seems more aimed toward the casual end of the occasional-hardcore spectrum, making the game's confusion and difficulty all the more puzzling. We hardcore folks are more liable to put up with a little initial difficulty for some ultimate payoff (mostly because it's not that difficult for us), but the novice players won't. It's difficult to imagine a casual gamer putting up with Toys in Space for more than a few minutes before realizing how unnecessarily difficult and convoluted the game is, and passing it up for something without so many execution problems.  So score this one Concept 1, Execution 0. Unless you're John McKay.  Then it's execution in a rout.  -- Mike Morrissey", "date": "Oct 29, 1999"}
