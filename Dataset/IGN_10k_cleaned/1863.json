{"name": "MDK 2", "name_review": "MDK2 Armageddon", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/03/28/mdk2-armageddon", "text": "Some say it means Murder Death Kill, a title which hearkens back to the now-famous motion picture treat Demolition Man. Others contend that the initials MDK represent the three characters you must take through this space adventure: Max, Dr. Hawkins and Kurt. I think it stands for Massively Difficult Kwest. Okay, so that's a major stretch, but you get the point.   MDK2 was one of the best action titles released last year when it came out for the Dreamcast and PC. Now Bioware and Digital Mayhem bring the same game to the Playstation 2. It's been tarted up a bit and renamed for PS2 release, but it's the same game at the core. MDK Armageddon is a relentless third-person action-adventure. Emphasis on the action. Major emphasis on the shooting aspect of action. You control a team of three space misfits. The ringleader is the brilliant but clumsy Dr. Hawkins, the mastermind behind such inventions as the atomic toaster and inflatable dummy. His pet Max is a bad-ass dog with six legs, who can hold up to four weapons at once, making him the brawn of the operation. The last character is Kurt, a janitor turned space hero, who has been equipped with Dr. Hawkins' award-winning, universe-saving coil suit, complete with chaingun arm and sniper hood. With this team, you're charged with the task of delivering the universe from the likes of Zizzy Balooba, a gigantic space slug with designs on total domination of the galaxy.  The game is amazingly fun and filled with wit and creativity. Each of the teammates has a different set of strengths, so you must adapt not only to the different environments, but also to your character' abilities. For instance, Max is a run and gun type of guy. Kurt is more of a stealth/sniper type, and Dr. Hawkins solves the puzzles in the game. MDK2 is a treat for anyone who relishes unique, ingenious but challenging gameplay. Gamers should welcome this return to difficulty. I sure did.   Presentation Bioware did an excellent job setting the tone of MDK 2. The opening titles and all loading screens thereafter present the story in a comic book fashion, and the game mimics this aesthetic. MDK 2 is brimming full of humor, from character and enemy design to the cutscenes that are interspersed throughout the game.   The one major problem with the game was load time. You only really have to deal with it between levels, but this can be quite aggravating, as each load screen is well over a minute. While this doesn't ultimately affect gameplay, it does kill enthusiasm.  Graphics This game isn't going to solve any Dreamcast/Playstation 2 arguments you've been having. Sure, it looks nice on the PS2, but it looked even better on the Dreamcast. Armageddon skimps on the textures, turning environments that were deep and vibrant on the DC to flat, lifeless landscapes.   What really stood out about this game on the DC were the gorgeous, deep environments. Although some of the depth has been replaced by flat textures here, certain things are still quite nice to look at. Since you are immersed in the vacuum of space, navigating through bleak alien lands, abandoned spaceships and the grimy lairs of real intergalactic sludge, the environments have to be unique. And even though the graphics may have stumbled a smidge for the PS2, they still convey the alien nature of your surroundings quite well.  One mission finds Max suspended over a lake of radioactive waste. It bubbles and spurts, oozing (digitally) in the rusty hold of a huge space cruiser. On Kurt's missions, he often has to run outside on the high trails of a galactic city. The backdrop is marvelous. Deep in the frame, hovercars flit around buildings and spaceships dock. The whole scene looks like something out of the Fifth Element.   It appears they lightened things up a little, which is a nice improvement, as previous incarnations of the game were a bit dark. But the lightening washed out the colors a bit as well, which cuts down on the vibrancy.  The character models are faithful to their original treatment, although it seems the textures again suffer on some of the larger bosses. For the lesser enemies, the texture problems are not as evident. The animations are especially good for the six-legged dog Max, which you may think would be the toughest to get right. Kurt looks great as well in his coil suit. Dr. Hawkins, since he has such a weird body shape, can run into some clipping problems.  One marked improvement over the Dreamcast version are the particle effects. The laser explosions, spraying alien blood and exploding rock all look amazing, as does the steady stream of shells coming from Kurt's chaingun. Score one for that particle system!  The game also sports a little slowdown in parts, but so did its DC counterpart. It doesn't interfere with gameplay much, but is a little vexing since they ramped down the textures.  Gameplay The gameplay is where MDK2: Armageddon really shines. If you're looking for a non-stop action game, this is the answer to your prayers. Since there are three sets of skills to learn (three levels apiece), the action never gets stale.  The game combines shooter, platformer and puzzle game elements together flawlessly. Since you switch to a new character to play each level, you'll encounter a good deal of unique challenges. As Kurt, you'll have to snipe distant lock balls, ride air vents on your ribbon chute and use your coil suit weaponry to blast through the game. The sniping aspect of the game is incredibly well done. Several later missions require you to snipe balls that control moving platforms. This requires a good deal of quickness and skill and seriously increases the challenge and fun of the game.  As the dog Max, you'll white knuckle four hand cannons, charging through vermin-infested corridors capping all the way. Max also wears a specially-designed jet pack which accounts for several of the toughest challenges in the game. Fans of action games cannot resist the allure of running around blazing with four gatling guns at once. But that's what Max is all about: brute, cigar-chomping, tail-wagging force.  As Dr. Hawkins you'll need to combine two objects (one in each hand) to form mysterious inventions that will help your through the game. Dr. Hawkins' quests are exceptionally done and bear extra mention here. The two-hand system is brilliant, and allows for some of the most inventive gameplay around. It is infinitely fun to see the doctor, armed with a toaster in one hand and a stick of plutonium in the other, to slam the two together to produce atomic toast missiles. In a later mission the good doctor must combine tape with magnets to make special magnet shoes for walking in an anti-gravity environment. Touches like this make MDK2 special.  Since this game has such a good sense of humor, the boss battles are innovative and fun as well. While some are straight shoot-outs, the final fight is pretty amazing, as you have to journey inside of the giant floating slimeball Zizzy Balooba and killing him from the inside out, attacking his organs--each character in his own special way. In another battle, Dr. Hawkins drinks a formula that temporarily changes him into a Mr. Hyde beast, allowing him to cosmically bitch-slap the egghead boss.   The one rip on the Dreamcast version was its difficulty. Armageddon fixes that by providing four difficulty settings. This way, everyone can enjoy the game. Hardcore gamers out there will love the Jinkies! setting, which is a challenge as tough as the Perfect setting on Perfect Dark. Easy is way too easy, but Medium is just right for beginners.  Control can take a little getting used to, but once you do is quite good. There are several ways to customize controls, but one was missing--the classic Turok control scheme, where movement is assigned to the four buttons and the camera is set to the analog stick. This would be my preferred control scheme, but was sadly absent. The default setting does the trick enough that control is not a huge issue.  Sound The sound in MDK 2 is key to the experience, as many creatures announce their arrival by signature sounds. There are some freaky space noises like spawning enemies and checkpoint sounds that will instantly remind you of the game (much like the Resident Evil menu sounds). The explosion and weapons sound effects are great. If Max is holding one gatling gun or four uzis, you hear the difference.  In addition to great sound effects, the voice work is exceptional, especially that of Dr. Hawkins. Who can resist the old coot saying ~Jinkies~ or ~Puppy wuppy dinky doggy?~ The voice acting adds a lot to the story, and ultimately, to the game experience. MDK 2: Armageddon is a great action title that is certainly worth twenty hours of your time. A great story, fast-paced adventure and a good deal of challenge make up for the fact that this game could (and did) look a lot better. Still, there is enough humor and fun here to warrant a purchase.", "date": "Mar 28, 2001"}
