We recently previewed KOF 94 along with Samurai Showdown V and later this year the Xbox will receive the Metal Slug 4 and 5 Combo Pack. There are a number of reasons these releases are successful but it's mostly because SNK knows how to make a classic title more than just a short-lived nostalgic treat. This requires an attention to the packaging, a streamlined presentation, and extra options that make the release relevant to the current gaming trends. KOF '02/'03 has all of these qualities and will put a smile on the face of anyone who wants to take a bloody trip down memory lane.    Like the Metal Slug release, both King of Fighters '02 and '03 are on separate discs. Both titles could've been crammed onto one DVD but because fanatics will see this release as two entries in a collection, separating the games was a good move.    King of Fighters 02 most resembles the classic combat of Dream Match '98 and includes a huge collection of around 40 characters. Some of the featured brawlers that were killed off in previous installments are back for more action. Mr. Karate, Athena, and Chang are all in attendance, and the two games combine to form an ultimate KOF cast. The sheer number of characters means that not every fighter is a keeper, and some of the contenders stand out from the crowd with incredibly powerful move sets. There are also a few clones, but there is bound to be some cross-over between move sets when the roster runs so deep.    This is a straight-up fighting experience that includes three man team battles but lacks the tag-team system of KOF '03. This means that a new fighter simply jumps in after their predecessor is killed, but cannot enter a fight beforehand. This feature was popularized by the Marvel Vs. Capcom series and while it can be visually exciting to have new characters interrupt a battle, fighting purists should appreciate '02 for its straight-forward style.   Aside from lengthy punch and kick combos there is a counter system that works in conjunction with power moves. Taking or inflicting damage builds up a meter at the bottom of the screen that can be tapped for more powerful attacks, giving the game a bit more strategy than the typical frantic blocking and countering. This is the type of game that begs to be mastered and gamers will quickly find a few favorite characters and memorize every one of their moves.    The menu options include a Local Mode which translates to offline play and a set of Xbox Live features. Local Mode includes Team Play, Team VS, Single Play, Single VS, Practice, and Challenge. Team challenges allow players to select three fighters and set their order of appearance. Practice mode offers the same wide selection of options as the rest of the game with a skill list, adjustable life gauge, and preset enemy actions.     King of Fighters 2003 has many of the same modes as '02 with a few minor gameplay differences. There is Arcade Play, Team Play, Team Survival, Team VS, Single VS, and Single Survival. Once again, the teams are made of up of three fighters but now there's a tag-team system in place for switching characters mid-battle. The R trigger swaps fighters in a slightly unresponsive manner that makes tagging more of calculated choice than a snap decision. Adding to the strategic element of team battles, players choose a team leader who is capable of performing the most powerful combos in the game. Beating the AI on harder difficulty levels means saving your big guns for only the toughest opponents. This extra component is a welcome addition to the series. Interestingly, in single survival mode each player chooses one character per match but is given three bars of health making for some longer confrontations.      KOF 2003 also includes an updated roster from 2002 with brand new characters, additional costumes, and improved graphics. The backgrounds have a number of three dimensional elements that make '03 feel less outdated and it looks more like a modern fighting game than a relic from years past.    Technically Speaking  Playing a re-release can become dull if nothing has been added to the experience. King of Fighters fans should know that the translations of both titles are excellent and include plenty of extras that weren't available in the arcade. In both games there are eight levels of difficulty and fully customizable control schemes. Players can adjust match length, the power gauge, match points, and sound levels for music and effects. They also include higher resolution graphics than a straight-up arcade port, although the original visuals are available in all of their pixilated glory.    There is a language selection feature which lets players choose from German, Italian, Japanese, English, French, and Spanish, as well as an auto save function, and rankings. All of these little bells and whistles are greatly appreciated. It's true that most of the previously mentioned options should be present in any competent fighting game but it's nice to see so many of them make it into a classic release.    King of Live  The most important addition to this series is the inclusion of Xbox Live functionality. Competition is the component that bolstered the popularity of the fighting genre when gamers had to hit the arcades with a pocket full of change to experience high quality computer generated combat. Now you can relive the thrill of challenging the best fighters in the world in an organized online fashion.    KOF 2002 includes a breakdown of match statistics sorted by week, month, overall, friends, and by different game types. There is also a lobby for browsing matches outside of the quick or optimatch searches. KOF 03 also has a statistical breakdown but trades the lobby for a competition option that allows players to set the registration delay, match interval, the time of the first match, and the minimum and maximum entrants. It is now possible to have an all-out arcade competition including over 100 competitors from the comfort of a couch. Tears of joy should be streaming down the face of every KOF fan.  The addition of Xbox Live functionality almost always improves a fighting game and it would have been nice if the competition option were available for both releases.    In both games, the friends list is available from the start menu of game mode. This allows players to make a fluid transition from honing their skills in single player to taking the battle online.    Players can add some personal touches to their online fighters with a color editor that allows for 15 areas of RGB adjustment on every fighter. Some wacky designs are possible but without a delicate attention to detail fiddling with shading is guaranteed to drastically flatten the character designs. Expect to see some blinding custom characters when more contenders enter into online battles.      Both games are slightly less impressive in the sound department. KOF 2002 has a nice assortment of language options and KOF 2003 allows players to preview the music tracks and choose between English and Japanese. Nearly all of the songs in both titles have a cheesy, synthesized feel that sound like they were ripped from the credits of an early 1980s sitcom. This isn't necessarily a negative quality, but the music is more passable than it is admirable.The King of Fighters series holds a special place in the hearts of many 2D fighting aficionados. Both titles are fast-paced, offense-heavy fighting games that offer plenty of depth for players who are willing to spend the time learning the mechanics. The Xbox versions of KOF 2002 and 2003 are more than just repackaged ports, they add an online mode and a bevy of options that should make them attractive to anyone looking to relive the glory days of 2D fighting.", "date": "Aug 24, 2005"}
