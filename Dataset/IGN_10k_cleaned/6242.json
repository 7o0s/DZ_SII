THQ Wireless, enjoying a full NBA license, wants fans to be in on the action along with their favorite players, and has introduced a suite of two basketball games: NBA Basketball 2006 and NBA Slam. The later is modeled after the league's annual slam-dunk contest, where players get a chance to show off their skills for fun and glory.   And if you think you have a fast enough thumb, you fly through the air right along side them.   NBA Slam is a very arcade-style game, an app you can bounce in and out of with only a few minutes of time required to burn off a few monster dunks. With a quick exhibition game, you can grab one of 55 NBA All-Stars included and make a run for the basket, leap in their and feverishly try to pull of as many moves as possible before stuffing the ball through the basket and waiting for your score. NBA Slam does include a tournament mode if you have a few more moments to spare. Eight players enter the contest, working their way down to a final two man showdown on the paint.   THQ Wireless' selection of dunks is pretty thick. There are fifteen total moves, including Tomahawk, 360, Windmill, Double Pump and Statue of Liberty. These are not made-up moves, either, but legit dunks that some of these players can perform in real life. Most players can use four of these dunks in each attempt, but some bigger players have limited sets, like Yao Ming. That cat only has two possible dunk moves. That's puts him at a disadvantage in the contest, but with a good thumb, you can help Ming compete.   The mechanics are simple, but they will not be mastered with your first, second, or even tenth try. You start on the opposite side of the court. Pressing ~OK~ starts your run toward the basket as a ~jump meter~ at the bottom of the screen fills up. Press ~OK~ again to take off into the air, where you must pound on all four directions of the thumbpad to pull off and series of midair moves. Finally, ~OK~ one last time will stuff the ball through the basket.   Now, when you start jamming on the d-pad, you won't have much of a chance to really study your player. However, if you peek over somebody else's shoulder, you can see them string together the moves in a series of quick animations that don't really flow too well together. It's jarring, but you're too busy trying to slap together a tight series of moves and time the final dunk to coming down to really notice.   After you finish your dunk, a table of five judges will flip up scorecards and rate your performance. A perfect dunk is worth 50, and that's when you are treated to a roaring crowd and some quick animations on the big board over the court. If you fail to stuff the ball, your score will be swiftly cleaved to a fraction of its original value, no mater how many moves you pulled off.   Normally, a simple formula like this would make me smile, play a few times, and ultimately move on. However, there are 11 hidden superstars in NBA Slam to unlock. Their names are blanked out in the player select screen, but on-screen instructions explain how to unlock them. You can also really juice the difficulty by playing in All-Star mode, which strips away the jump meter while running down the court.NBA Slam is a fun, quick game that gives you a nice shoot of basketball action for those stolen moments in the day. It's not the most subtle game you can play, though. Other people may wonder why you are dialing with such furious anger. Little do they know you are just helping LeBron James finish up a perfect 360. The game takes some practice, as you cannot just nail a 50 by jamming on the pad randomly. There is some finesse in here, as well as some unlockables, and those save NBA Slam from being disposable. This is not going to be everybody's idea of good times, but NBA fans seeking the occasionally adrenaline rush of a monster dunk should be suitably entertained.", "date": "Oct 29, 2005"}
