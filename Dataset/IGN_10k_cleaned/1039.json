{"name": "Road to El Dorado", "name_review": "Road to El Dorado", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/22/road-to-el-dorado", "text": "So Miguel and Tulio (or Tulello or whatever the heck his name is) are searching for gold. And they traipse up and down the coasts of California and the West Americas, looking for gold (all the while finding gold coins strewn willy-nilly in the streets). They find a game map, which basically (if I could read Spanish) would explain that the treasure is on the left side of the game screen. Miguel and Togali bumble around and enjoy harrowingly dull adventures, meet one girl along the way (California apparently wasn't the swinging singles scene in the 1600s), and find the mythical El Dorado, the Lost City of Gold right where they expected it to be all along, on the right-hand side of the game map. I'm guessing that all the New World's failed conquistadors were simply dyslexic, because how else would they find great challenge in this game's simple traps and slack gameplay?  Features Play as either Tulio or Miguel.  Ride the comic foil horse Altivo.  30 different enemies to beat.  Six levels of platforming action.  Ubi Key support: Unlock secret levels by interacting with other Ubi Soft games.  For Game Boy Color only.     It's not that Ubi Soft's The Road To El Dorado is a terminally bad game. It just suffers the same fate of being so average in a sea of platformers that it can't help but sinking itself. The animation and graphics are fine, both Miguel and Torpedo are animated well (although the technique used makes them blur), and the backgrounds are occasionally better than expected. There are even a few scenes (such as the bull run) that are interesting in their variety, and the levels are nice and big for exploring.  But why bother when there's nothing interesting hidden in any of these levels besides Ubi Soft's Ubi Key? By gum, these are explorers we are talking about here. They should do some serious searching for their prize. The gold shouldn't simply be sprinkled gingerly about the level, and the main goal shouldn't simply be found by going from left to right. But that's how base the gameplay is.   It's a kids game, sure, but it's a dull kids game, one that doesn't try very hard to enthrall its audience. Most of the enemies you fight are snakes and mice, battled down with a single sword stroke. Bosses are simple and not very threatening (some don't even move). Miguel and Tatonka have all the same moves and skills, so choosing between the two buddies is a choice of whether you prefer blondes or brunettes.  And the core gameplay is very archaic for today's sophisticated kids. Characters being able to walk on clouds may have flown in the days of Kid Khameleon and Adventure Island, but here that type of platforming seems downright silly (and, of course, there are no rewards anywhere in the skies to bother with besides health in the magical cloudscape). The silliest thing about the gameplay is that you spend a lot of time racking up points. Points! Little boys haven't compared high scores since Dave Nelson brushed off his SATs for Stargate Defender. Granted, occasionally kids will be impressed by a buddy's top ranking in Tony Hawk, but only true losers would brag about breaking 40K in the Game Boy version of The Road To El Dorado. ~Yeah, anybody can score that much using Miguel, but can you do that same thing with Toshiro?~    Let's face it: Platformers need to involve their audience, whether by storyline or by character or by atmosphere or by nifty graphics. Dull trips through retreaded platform gaming in repeating lands with two goofs (named Miguel and Tuwhatshisface) that couldn't uspstage their own horse in their film are not going to excite kids. It's all decent, but much like the movie, it's second rate entertainment.", "date": "Jun 22, 2000"}
