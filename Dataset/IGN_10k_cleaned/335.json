Wrestling games have been huge on the system and have provided console owners a means to release their aggressions but games like WWF Attitude and WCW Mayhem don't quite capture the technical aspects and coordination you get with a true fighter. With Knockout Kings 2000 the N64 gets another ring sport trying to fill the fighting game void by giving gamers access to two dozen of the best fighters to ever strap on a pair of gloves. While it's great to fight as and against boxing legends of the past and present, it's a little strange to see Muhammad Ali throwing a blazing power uppercut like Ryu or Ken from the Street Fighter series. KK2000 has a little trouble balancing it's boxing simulation and arcade game features and the player ends up getting an incomplete experience either way.  The Facts:   Interactive training mode to learn moves and techniques. Enhanced create-a-boxer. New face wrap technology for authentic looking fighters. New boxer specific moves like Sugar Ray Leonard's bolo punch. New sound features like new entrance music, crowd cheers and taunts and the sounds of landing punches. Motion captured Mills Lane as referee. Slugfest mode where any fighter can fight any other fighter regardless of weight, with no ref.  Train and fight in famous gyms and arenas around the world.   The Fighters  Muhammad Ali Roberto Duran ~Sugar~ Ray Leonard Eric ~Butterbean~ Esch Oscar De La Hoya Evander Holyfield Lennox Lewis ~Marvelous~ Marvin Hagler Aaron Pryor Alexis Arguello Pernell Whitaker David Tua Leon Spinks Danny Romero David Reid Ike Quartey Sean O'Grady Shane Mosley Oba Carr Joe Frazier Larry Holmes Kevin Kelley Angel Manfredy Floyd Mayweather Fernando Vargas  Gameplay You have a choice between the Career Mode and the straight forward Slugfest Mode. Slugfest is just what it sounds like. You and an opponent, either human or computer controlled, going at it with whatever rules you set up for the fight and no referees. You can choose any of the fighters and match them against any of the other fighters regardless of weight class. Of course if you have a 130 pound Angel Mandredy going against 330-pounder, Butterbean then expect the smaller fighter to be faster but less powerful and the big lumbering oaf to pack one hell of a wallop whenever does land a solid punch.   The Career Mode is the single player mode of choice and works with either your created boxer or one of the legendary fighters in the game. You'll be assigned to the real-life fighter's weight class or the appropriate class for the weight of your created boxer. Sometimes you can gain a slight advantage by picking the heaviest possible lightweight or heavyweight weight for your created fighter. A 185 pound ~middleweight~ is a lot tougher than a true 160 pound middleweight.   You'll start off ranked in the toilet and you'll have to fight several of the computer made palookas that share your crappy ranking before you can fight the superstars and challenge for the title. If you're ranked, say, 18th, you will only have the option of fighting the 17th, 16th and 15th ranked fighters ahead of you. Rather than just fighting the guy that's ranked higher than you, it might be a good idea to look at the strengths and weaknesses of each guy and determine whose ass you're more likely to whip given your skill level. The highest ranked guy can sometimes be the biggest chump.  The rankings are based totally on accumulated points. Players score points on a fight-by-fight basis. Landing combos, knocking out your opponent and picking up consecutive victories are among the many ways to pick up points. You can pick up points even when you lose but it's definitely not the way you want to go. When you finally reach the rank of number one contender, regardless of what your record is, you'll get a shot at the champion in one of the more luxurious arenas in the game like Ceasar's Palace.   The create-a-boxer feature and attention to detail are great simulation elements that make for an engaging boxing game. The confusion comes when you actually step into the ring, in any mode, and begin throwing punches. There are a wide variety of punches available to each fighter using combinations of the R Button, Z trigger and the A and B buttons. The A-button corresponds to the fighter's strong hand, the B-button controls the lead hand. This can get a little confusing if you start switching between right handed and southpaw fighters. The control itself is actually very well thought out and comprehensive in theory but in practice it makes hitting your opponent way to easy.  There's not enough strategy involved in protecting your boxer while still trying to attack your opponent. While it's not as fun, there's nothing to stop you from just standing there toe to toe with the opponent and just slugging it out with him punch for punch. If you're guy has a faster speed rating, you'll hit him more times than he'll hit you. If you have a stronger power rating, your punches will hurt him more. Either way there's little to motivate you to protect your boxer even when your opponent is tagging you with combinations. You know that eventually he'll be done and then you can continue to stand there and beat on him.   When you get close to top the top ranking in the career mode or if you notch the difficulty up to hard in slugfest mode, you'd think you'd be presented with more of a challenge that would require all of your skills. Wrong. Even when you're at the toughest levels of the game, it almost seems predetermined that the guy with the higher overall ranking will win. We took lightweight Angel Manfredy against Evander Holyfield on the hardest difficulty and took a savage beating for three rounds. Holyfield's tremendous stamina made him impervious to almost every punch even though we landed three times as many punches as he did. Now of course Evander's 80 pound weight advantage means he's more powerful but we still should've had a better payoff for using strategy to effectively out punch a clearly superior fighter.  We tested our theory by immediately taking Ali against ~The Real Deal~ on the same difficulty and we beat him silly for three rounds before finally scoring the KO the fifth time we knocked him down. Same strategy, different boxer, different result.   On the other hand, the constant back and forth action may appeal to the arcade boxing fan. In addition to the lead and strong hand punching you also get a few extra treats to use against your opponents. The C-buttons correspond to one of four ~signature punches~ that each fighter has. For Sugar Ray Leonard, he'll wind up his right hand like Popeye and throw his quick left jab in his famous bolo punch. One of Ali's signature moves is his victorious shuffle where he raises his hands over his head. While this doesn't hurt the opponent it does look cool. The problem is that signature punches, usually a combination of some sort, are difficult to land and they take off a nice piece of your fighter's health.  While the old health-depleting move is a staple among fighting games, it doesn't really fly in KK2000 because the payoff is to small for such a costly and risky move. Do it for the looks only.  Another weapon you'll have is the super power punch. You have to build up your punch meter by landing power punches like uppercuts, hooks and body blows. When it fills up your punch icon starts to flash and you can unleash a devastating hook or uppercut, complete with rainbow colored motion streaks, that's guaranteed to knock your opponent down if you land it. The opponent will often spin around in a daze or even do an unconscious backflip on his way to the canvas. But landing it is the tricky part. It seems to take 20 minutes to wind up for this punch so everyone knows it's coming. When you miss it, you will be nice and vulnerable afterwards.  Knockout Kings sacrifices too much strategy for the sake of keeping the action hot. While we agree a good boxing game, especially the first on the N64, needs both strategy and action to make it fun, a lackluster attempt to provide both is extremely frustrating. The great variety of punches EA Sports incorporated so well is almost wasted because you only need to master a few to be successful. The accuracy of the different fighting styles only seems to matter in the most extreme cases. Holyfield has a tremendous chin and seems to smile as he takes punch after punch. If Ali isn't the fastest puncher in the game, even over some of the lightweights, then he's certainly the most lethal combination of speed and power. Most other fighters are floating somewhere between the extremes, so the only extra powers they'll have will come from your admiration of them  Graphics It seems strange that this game plays with basically the same two fighters in the same ring in front of the same crowd, but it will still suddenly slowdown to an unbearable speed. We're not talking about on the super power punches either. Those are slow and drawn out for dramatic effect and that's fine. We're talking about when we're trying to move away from the opponent while throwing jabs and all of a sudden it chops up nearly to the point of stopping. This bad in and of itself, but the subsequent lag is what really upset us. When you're backing away trying to fire jabs to keep the guy off of you and it suddenly slows down, all of that button mashing you're doing is still being registered. Your guy won't actually throw the punches because he's caught in his time warp of missing frames. When he comes out of it and the game speeds up again, he'll still throw those jabs but of course they'll fly right over your opponent's head since he's inside landing thousands of kidney punches by then.  The animations are actually very well done and the punches all look unique and precise. You'll recognize some of the signature punches right off that bat. When you get guys crouching and leaning and throwing overhand rights and left, this game truly looks beautiful. The motion captured moves really paid off in Knockout Kings since the character models are so big. Every bend of the elbow and bob of the head looks natural and anatomically correct.  The medium resolution graphics leave a little to be desired but they are bearable. Some of the fighters don't look as sharp and clear as we know them to be in real life, but EA Sports has done enough with the face mapping feature so that you can tell Larry Holmes from Joe Frazier. On guys like the notoriously ugly Leon Spinks, the rough looking graphics may actually be a blessing. The arenas actually look very good for what there is to see of them. The crowd seems to be the same flat complacent one from every other EA Sports videogame. The round card girls are painful.  Sound It starts with the intro. O has been popping up on all kinds of EA games this fall and he has a featured role as the musical voice of Knockout Kings 2000. The intro song itself, ~In the game,~ may have trouble climbing up the Billboard charts but it  does plenty to get you ready to duke it out.  The sounds of a boxing match seem to be captured accurately and add a lot to the experience. The punches thump and thud appropriately and they guys grunt and whimper when those punches do land. Like in many wrestling games, the crowd reacts to the action of the ring and you can tell how well you're doing by their cheering.   The best sound elements come from Mills Lane. His voice samples come whenever you access the pause menu. He sounds just as gruff and sure as he does on that People's Court rip-off he does. The voice talents of Jimmy Lennon, Sean O'Grady and Al Albert are all very well done but they seem to be a bit under utilized, especially in the case of the play-by-play announcers.  When we played an earlier version of Knockout Kings 2000, it seemed more like a simulation boxing game than this final product. All of the strategy of avoiding punches and choosing your attacks wisely seems to be missing. It's not arcadey enough to just be an over-the-top rock 'em, sock 'em battle. As a boxing fan, there's just something sacrilegious about The Greatest throwing a flaming punch. He was good enough to avoid resorting to such trickery mysticism. With that said, I think KK2000 would have been much better off sticking to the sim route and focusing on strategy and A.I. to entertain interested gamers.  This would've put some distance between the EA game and the upcoming Ready 2 Rumble, which has arcade action locked down.", "date": "Oct 21, 1999"}
