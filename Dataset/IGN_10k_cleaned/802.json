The first time you rode your bike without training wheels. The first time you had a scoop of ice cream. Hell, even the first time you went to the John all by your lonesome. It's almost... magical (and if your parents had a camera around as much as mine did, it was undoubtedly embarrassing, as well). Memories like that stick out for everyone, and my favorite crafters of childhood dreams just happened to make a name for themselves off their ability to capture and sell said simplicity. Call me a weenie, but I was always blown away by Walt Disney's countless animated classics as a kid. Love 'em or hate 'em, there's just no denying that the house that Walt built has a knack for capturing your imagination, and said ability keeps films like The Jungle Book and Bambi in a class all by themselves.   Up until now, I wasn't quite sure that a game could do the same thing for me. I mean, Mario 64 had been pretty engrossing. Tomb Raider had a glimmer of that Hollywood atmosphere. But in as much as they were impressive, the tools by which they manipulated my imagination were, well, familiar. I had done the song and dance with the Princess before, and even with a bra on, I recognized Indiana Jones. These games undoubtedly had charm, but the problem is, it wasn't exactly their own.   And then along came Ray. Yeah, he had already shined in the 16-bit era for the proud few who had managed to endure his hellacious difficulty, but it was but a shadow on what we now have before us. Rayman has finally arrived in 3D glory, and he is absolutely amazing. This game inspires the type of awe that leaves me feeling completely inadequate as a wordsmith. When I first sat down with Rayman 2: The Great Escape, I wasn't quite sure how to put the feeling of complete and utter amazement it forced on me. And even worse for a guy on deadline, I wasn't quite sure of the best way to make you understand how much I love this game. But then the above analogy hit me, and that's really all you need to understand. And if that is too much for you, think of that geek in your school who absolutely can't get enough of collecting Pokemon. That kid who has never missed an episode of X-Files. Your annoying little sister and her collection of Barbies. You know what I mean. Irrefutable, absolute obsession.    Sure, I've known it before, but never like this, and never from square one. But much like the game's feature film-quality introduction, the entire experience seems to be aware of a level of quality that has yet to be discovered by other titles in the genre. It's just all here... and it is all unbelievably good.    But what is it about the game that makes it so incredible? I mean, platforming has come a long way since the likes of SMB and Pitfall, and Miyamoto's work on the N64 is certainly nothing to scoff at. But, I'm telling you, this game stomps it in so many ways.    It's not just of the characters, who are nothing short of brilliant. Forget that Rayman himself is totally incredible. The rest of the game's cast will have you in stitches on a regular basis. From the confusing yet amusing Teensies to Globox and his endless stream of quirky kids, you will constantly find yourself smiling and laughing at their unique, over-the-top personalities. You may not get what I'm saying now, but the first time you throw a giant plumb at the grunting, flailing Mongoloid guard and watch it stick on his head to the tune of his perplexed mumbling, you will absolutely lose it. Trust me.    And it isn't only the game's artwork, which is so incredibly breath-taking that you'll find yourself near tears of joy over the fact that something so pain-stakingly detailed could ever be in front of your greedy gaming hands. Not only that, but you'll also a little bit amazed that you can honestly say that this game may even have a visual edge on the great Shenmue. I can't tell you how many times I entered a new area and my jaw just hit the floor. It is painfully evident that this game was a visual labor of love, and a square kick in the mouth of those who would claim that game development is not an art.    And surprisingly enough, it isn't the game's level design, which puts together said artwork with some of the most amazing puzzles and events I've ever seen. From rocket rides to snake slides, this game constantly had me guessing, and when you've got a pirate ship chasing you, blasting away the boardwalk as you narrowly escape by clinging to the rope bridge above, you'll feel the exact same way.    And all of this completely forgets the game's control, which is near-flawless. With the exception of some clunky swimming mechanics, the game makes great use of the Dreamcast controller, and continually found new ways to pull me into the levels. And thank Ubi for the ability to make split-second decisions, which are a must when you're barreling down a hill at a blistering pace only to find that there is nothing but a lum loop between you and the bottom of a 40 story drop. Your palms will sweat like a fat man in a volcano on this one, but Rayman 2 is more than up to the task of letting you take command.    And then there's the audio, which contains some of the most amazing clips this side of a fully-realized Hollywood production we've ever heard. The soundtrack is awesome, with everything from techno to sweeping scores, and the sound effects include everything from a Banjo-thrasing voice troupe to little elements like realistic ropes sounds and the pitter patter of little Ray-feet when you walk on grass! It is just plain incredible.   I only have so much time to put this down, so I'll try to make it simple: If I could boil it all down to one word, Rayman 2's excellence is derived from vision. Not just for the characters, or the visuals, or the control. This game has a strong sense of itself as a whole, and when you sit down with the final product, it will become immediately evident that you're playing something much greater than a mere game. This thing is practically a blueprint for innovative platform design, and more importantly, it is an excellent object lesson for developers in search of the future of gaming production values.    I'd go on, but I'm sure you catch my drift. This game has me in its grip, and the only bad thing I can say about it is that, eventually, it had to let me go. Roughly 10-12 hours long, the Great Escape is comparably short when looking at other recent entries into the field, but personally, I'd rather have a game with this level of overall quality than an ode to back-tracking with familiar characters that hits ~the magic 40.~ When you throw in the Dreamcast-exclusive mini-games, there is more than enough to keep you busy, and even at half it's length with no extras to speak of, this game would more than be worth the price of entry. Rayman 2: The Great Escape is, without question, the most impressive feat of game design and execution the platforming genre has ever seen. Forget Mario. Forget Banjo. And don't even think about Crash. This is the next evolution in gaming, and it has never looked or played better than it does on your Dreamcast. I am still in shock that it did as poorly in the retail as it did its first go 'round. From where I'm sitting, if this game doesn't sell, then gaming is truly dead. Go pick it up and let Ubi know you still believe in magic. I know I do.   -- Brandon Justice, IGNDC As far as a true adaptation of the Jaguar game, this is not the same Rayman that I remember. It looks similar (although obviously not the same), and it plays the same. But it is much easier than the terribly frustrating, near-impossible 32-bit game. Thank you, Ubi Soft!It's also shorter. Much shorter, by about 40 levels. There is only one boss, and the Mr. Dark encounter is brief and sort of anticlimactic. There are fewer power-ups, and none of the peripheral characters made the translation.But really, that's just nit-picking on a sharp and enjoyable game. Even though some is missing, there's plenty of Rayman gaming to love here. If you love the Rayman mechanics in either the sidescrolling original or even the 3D sequel, or if you just love a great platformer with an eyeful of splendor, Rayman on Game Boy Color has enough character and fun to earn a spot in your pocket.", "date": "Mar 22, 2000"}
