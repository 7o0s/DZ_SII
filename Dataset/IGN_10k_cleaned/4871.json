These guys are a world away from my reality, but there's something appealing to watching an alternate set of morals and honor. So whenever I have the opportunity to play a gangster game and immerse myself in that lifestyle without actually having to compromise my oh-so-lofty principles and morals, I take the opportunity with fervor. Unfortunately I usually get disappointed (aside from my experiences with one beautiful action game called Mafia) so I wasn't entirely surprised to find my near complete lack of enthusiasm for Chicago 1930 after playing it for 30 minutes. After playing it for several hours, my lack of enthusiasm had turned into a severe dislike. It's not that my fascination with mafia games had waned, just that the game's AI, and general lack of anything redeeming, made me consider tying this game to a cement block and dumping it in San Francisco Bay.   At first glance, Chicago 1930 looks a bit like a Commandos type of game. It's up to you to play through the game as a mobster trying to make his name in Chicago by taking over property one section at a time. On the other side of the coin, you could also don the uniform of an officer of the law and take down the bad guys. Both sides have close to the same set of skills, but the cops have the added difficulty of not being able to just take down any enemies that might be in their way.   Whichever side you play from, you choose up to five members for your team to finish a level. They'll have different sets of skills, which can be increased during the course of the game, such as shooting, melee combat, and throwing. The kicker is, it doesn't really matter too much. Your guys are dead before they really get started. While you can certainly run through the game meticulously, holding each of your team members' hands, they'll die. This is for quite a few reasons, the biggest of which is AI.   Friendly AI is basically non-existent. You tell them to do something and they'll do it. If you don't give them direct orders, they just stand there, defenseless, like a cute little child with candy in its hand. Even better, the list of commands that you can give your squad is very small. Tell them all to go into a room at the same time and they'll do it. But they'll bunch up together so that if you come across some bad guys and tell your guys all to shoot at an enemy, they'll shoot each other in the back of the head. A simple command to spread out in some formation would help with that. Or if you aren't going to put in a formation set, at least make it so there's no friendly fire.     There are also no real options for setting up ambushes or playing creatively from the lack of control. In Commandos, you deal with your units by setting them up with areas of coverage so that they'll shoot anyone that comes into their firing cone. You can't do that here so any units not directly under control become useless. The almost complete lack of cover options, unlike the recently released Soldiers: Heroes of World War II also would have helped the situation.    Knowing what you're getting into is also a problem. There's no option to look through keyholes or windows so you'll just have to hope the door you're opening doesn't hold a guy with a shotgun pointed at you.   Basically this makes your squad members meat shields. Just use them to run ahead and get killed to see the layout of the land. There are some levels where your men will make it through unscathed, but that's with a lot of work and annoyance. It's often just more practical to use your men as expendable assets. Hopefully you'll be able to shoot some enemies and reload your gun clumsily while the enemies are distracted by the big idiot running at them.   That's really the only saving grace for your goon squad. The enemies are nearly as dumb. While it makes combat a little easier than it could have been, it also makes it completely uninteresting, much like the rest of the game. Strategy is basic and puzzle elements are a far cry from the masterful Commandos series.   While the game doesn't play well in any fashion, it does actually look pretty decent. The cartoony 2D graphics still hold a place in my heart, but the fact that you can't rotate the camera around is annoying. I'd like to have different angles to help with my viewing the playing field.I can't in any frame of mind recommend this title. It has shoddy controls, uninteresting level design, and combat so flawed that it's painful to be part of it. While the premise of fighting as a gangster or a cop over the streets of Chicago is a good one, this just isn't the way to do it. Chicago 1930 isn't a complete waste thanks to some decent visuals and occasional moments of interest, but overall, it's a pretty poor that offers little entertainment value.", "date": "Jul 31, 2004"}
