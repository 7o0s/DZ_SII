It's not that I'm complaining, I'm just curious how many more viable ideas Frontier is going to come up with to expand RollerCoaster Tycoon 3. The parent product covered a lot of bases already with so many themes and rides and the first expansion brought in the world of water parks (which was a lot of fun) and now this latest expansion called Wild! adds in some gameplay that those who play Zoo Tycoon will be familiar with. This expansion, like the first, adds a bunch of new content and improves some of the older features as well creating an even more complete amusement park simulation.   I wasn't particularly surprised when Atari and Frontier announced the next expansion would tackle the task of building up a theme park based around animal exhibition. It's one of the few amusement park types left untouched by the series up until this point. For the most part, the expansion is good. Players will have a variety of animals to build enclosures for along with a bunch of new rides (everything from awesome new coaster types to gentle safari rides) and two new themes. Also included are new billboards and customizable shops (which will be the first introduction to in game advertising to those that have an Internet connection and want them) which you can place any image on that you want. Make your own art, put pictures of yourself in the game it doesn't matter which. A new lion show and This translates into a lot of new stuff with which to ornament parks.     RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Wild! includes enough to be satisfying on a superficial level though those looking for any real enclosure design aspects might be a bit disappointed. As far as I've been able to figure out, you can stick an animal in any environment with any amount of foliage and it won't matter much as long as the enclosure is big enough. Similarly, animals don't seem to care about terrain levels or if there's actually water in the enclosure. None of the hippos I put into my attractions ever actually went swimming anyway. Microsoft's Zoo Tycoon (which has sold a trillion zillion copies) isn't the best game in the world, but even it brings a higher level of simulation and management to the subject matter and includes specific needs for animals in certain climates (though a tad bit too specific I do admit), several different options for enclosure walls, and more. As it is, it's simply not a challenge in the slightest.   The biggest worry is that some of your creatures might accidentally escape their enclosures should the fences fall into disrepair. So far this hasn't happened to me, but should it, I'd be ready with the new tranquilizer gun mini game. When an animal is loose in the park (or the occasional mini-challenge will require you take part in a tranqing exercise) the view will switch to a gun mode where you're suddenly flying around in a helicopter with a tranquilizer sniper rifle shooting at animals to put them back in their cages. It's not really much of a game, but at least provides a diversion every now and again.     What I find the most interesting is that ride placement and park design doesn't seem to make a difference. Roller coasters being too close to enclosures doesn't seem to spook out any of the animals. I guess I'm not an expert in animal behavior, but it seems that in most cases animals would probably run into a corner and crap themselves from the stress when a roaring train accompanied by screaming humans flies by at 90 miles per hour. I guess the one thing that this adds to the game is the ability to create some truly wacky rides and enclosures that intermingle more intimately than a speeding train and an antelope normally would.   On the better side, Wild! mixes rides and enclosures together in a more meaningful way with safari jeeps, elephant rides, and the like. These are simple rides that run flat along the ground but have the added touch of being able to move right through animal exhibits for a fun safari style adventure. They aren't fast, but when planned out to traverse enough enclosures they can be pretty exciting for park guests and bring in a good bit of cash to your park.    When it comes to cash crops, there's probably nothing like breeding animals. Now, I'm all for making money at my parks. I'm one of those money grubbing theme park tycoons that mostly cares about the bottom line you see. Thankfully, when any animals have the lucky fortune of becoming proud parents, I can sell their child to the highest bidder. It's a little unclear whether these animals are finding good homes or being sent to the slaughterhouse, but at least there's some cash in my pocket. Ostriches in particular seem to produce young the fastest. Setting your park up with some healthy females and a couple of stud males will bring in plenty of young to sell off for a couple hundred bucks a pop. At this point, I almost always try to start an ostrich farm at the beginning of a game simply because of its ability to generate cash.   Selling off animals isn't the only way to get money from their presence though. While you simply build enclosures for them to stay in, you actually have to build observation platforms in order for park visitors to enjoy them as well. As with everything else in the game, this comes with an entrance fee and will bring in a constant stream of revenue. It seems a little strange but brings up the question, how do you balance making money with allowing people to take a peek at some precious animals? Most real zoos just charge an entrance fee and then rake you over the coals for food, drinks, and souvenirs. Games like Wild! and ZT have to consider different options. I liked the idea of the donation box in Zoo Tycoon 2 where people donated depending on how much they like the animals and the enclosure, but that had it's flaws. I suppose Wild!'s viewing deck idea isn't a bad one, but why anyone would want to pay for a viewing platform when they can simply look over the top of a small wooden fence is beyond me.     Outside of the biggest addition of animal exhibits, there have been even more improvements made to the core game, the biggest of which is that you can tunnel through any surface now. It's something I've wanted for a while and it's finally here. It's not implemented exactly how I would have dreamed it, but it's a huge step in the right direction. It's much easier to complete a coaster that snakes its way through a mountainside. The biggest problem is that it can create large holes in your landscape. If, in the middle of construction of a coaster in and around hills, you decide that you want your coaster to go in a different direction, you might find that your hill is now full of holes as well as coaster. There's still no undo button so you'll be stuck with your holes unless you build them back up yourself.   Those who didn't purchase the Soaked! expansion pack will also have some of the features found in that expansion like laser shows and waterfalls so you won't be behind in terms of game features.    RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Wild! is worth the purchase if you're a big fan of the series. There are some good additions here and even though animals are largely a surface treatment, they're still a welcome addition. Along with all of the other additions to content which include rides and improvements to some core game mechanics, Wild! proves to be a good, but not quite great, expansion pack.", "date": "Oct 25, 2005"}
