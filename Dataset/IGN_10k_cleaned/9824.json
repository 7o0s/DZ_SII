Mobile maker Gameloft has flanked each console release with a wireless counterpart. However, as the prince has no new outing right now, Gameloft has given the nod to this summer's Xbox Live Arcade update of the classic adventure game. It's a remarkable translation and the fact that it's still a gas to play despite having spent many, many hours with the prince on mobile is a testament tot he staying power of impeccable game design.   Prince of Persia Classic mirrors the old-school challenges of the classic platformer -- all of the pit-jumping, ledge-hanging, and sword-swinging is back. And if you were a fan, it's pretty much exactly where you remembered it to be. That's a good thing, too, since the game relies heavily on memorizing the location of the pitfalls in later parts of the hour-long dungeon quest to save the stolen princess.   That's right. Technically, Prince of Persia is only an hour long -- but good luck plowing through it on your first go. You will fall victim to swords and spikes. You will restart the game several times before you can even smell the princess' perfume. Mercifully, there are checkpoints scattered throughout the game, so you don't have to actually set aside a straight hour to actually play the game.   The game's platforming is still tight as hell. Timing those jumps and rushing through traps is smooth and the games responsive controls never get in the way. Combat is a bit trickier, especially the timing stuff to block incoming slashes or bump back unstoppable foes. It really would have taken some effort on Gameloft's part to get the game wrong, especially after turning out such an awesome edition for XBLA. That didn't happen here, and I found Prince of Persia Classic a great play from front to back.   Prince of Persia Classic looks great. The sharp visuals and excellent animation are a real compliment to the action. Watch for the little details, such as the way the prince slinks through danger zones or artfully makes leaps of faith over pits. This stuff looks good -- and not just for mobile. It just looks good.  Unless you are just tired of playing with the prince altogether (and I can actually understand a little fatigue), Prince of Persia Classic is a great download for not only his fans, but fans of a good action gaming challenge. When you get the timing down, whether its clashing swords or hopping chasms, Prince of Persia Classic rewards. Definitely check it out.", "date": "Jan 8, 2008"}
