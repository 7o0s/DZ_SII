Tradition, excellence, and pride are coveted more in the world of college pigskin than in any other sport, creating great memories, long lasting rivalries, and a sense that there is something bigger than life.  Yes, I'm a big fan of this great American sport more so than professional football because there's so much more on the line than just money or big time trophy.  Through my great college experience, I've learned that even if your team is having a losing season, if the home team beats their rival at the end of the season, all is forgiven and all is right.   College football is a sacred sport and when word that Visual Concepts was treading into this realm, sports fans everywhere were ecstatic to see the well-known and highly skilled wizards work their magic and innovation of the NFL 2K series into the college universe.  The results of their work culminate into their latest Dreamcast sports title NCAA College Football 2K2: Road To The Rose Bowl... unfortunately, VC's latest efforts falls short of delivering a great college football experience.   First off, NCAA 2K2 is far from being a bad football game - this is Visual Concepts were talking about here.  Utilizing their knowledge and the great NFL2K engine, they've been able to put together a fine football game with some nice elements from the college game.  But as a college football game, it's only satisfactory especially if you can recite your alma mater with no problem.  To discern a football game from a college football, there are many specific details that need to be met, and NCAA 2K2 doesn't meet certain requirements with the attention to detail or quality that I expected. NCAA 2K2 features all 118 Division 1-A teams across the United States.  Sorry, no Division 1-AA teams like Fordham or Delaware will be found in this title.  That might seem a bit of a letdown, but considering you have all the stadiums from those Division 1-A teams, it's one that I think is worth it.  Each stadium has been painstakingly replicated with the greatest detail, so you'll recognize a stadium instantly by its architecture.  You can tailor the weather to your specifications of wind speed, temp, precipitation, and time - yes, you can even make it snow in California.  The most impressive visual detail that you'll immediately notice is the grass texture of the field, and it's some of the best grass texture I've ever seen.  Players sport new some new tackle and falling animations, as well new character animations when you get a close-up of players: wide receivers will tighten up their gloves, defensive ends will massage their forearms, and quarterbacks will place their hands on the temple of their helmets.  But other than these visual changes, NCAA 2K2 looks pretty much like NFL2K and in some cases, not quite as good.  One of the techniques that NFL2K used to keep the frame rate very high is a technique known as model swapping.  When you play NFL 2K once in awhile, you'll notice polygons warping on the players when they start new animations or after a particular play sequence has finished.  If you didn't notice it at all in NFL 2K, that's because the game didn't show it that often, but in NCAA 2K2, you'll notice it quite frequently.  Shoulder and thigh pads will bulge suddenly, players will strangely ~warp~ a little to the left or right... it doesn't ruin gameplay, but it occurs frequently enough to annoy.  Models aren't quite as detailed as previous football games either and although they've added a number of new animations, most of the animations are copied straight from NFL 2K.  Unfortunately, we see more of these than newer animations.  Still, all can be forgiven provided that the gameplay is fresh and truly delivers that college playing feeling, right?  Almost everything about NCAA 2K2's gameplay is solid and quite challenging.  The gameplay is much faster, not only due to the shorter college clock, but plays run much faster than in NFL 2K1.  When it comes to plays, you've got a whole lot of new and exciting plays to try out, and you're going to have to use them all; I have yet to find a true ~money~ play in the game.  The closest thing I've found are sharp ~out~ passing patterns, and even then, you can't run the same play with the same results.  The AI is quite challenging and I've found the passing game much more challenging, something which I applaud since in NFL 2K1 it was pretty easy to get a first down.  Faster speed means faster defense, and you've got the standard dime and nickel packages as well as the college ~four-four~ formation.  Gameplay is as solid as NFL 2K1 in almost every aspect except oneEand it's probably what makes the difference between college and professional football.  Although you see it once in a blue moon in the NFL, the option is as common a sight to see in college as the beer keg.  Although not every team runs the option, at least half of the college teams in the NCAA have a couple of versions of the option, especially if they run a wishbone formation.  With that in mind, in NCAA 2K2 you can run the option just fine... so long as you don't have the quarterback keep the ball.  When employing the option, the quarterback, along with at least one other tailback, run almost parallel with each other, where the QB has the option to dish off to the other halfbacks or keep the ball himself.  Well, in NCAA 2K2 you better pitch to the halfback, because you're not going to get very far with the quarterback.  But you want to the QB to run with the ball, while the halfbacks draw the defense?  Well, you can but don't expect to turbo dash.  In almost every option play, you press the A button to pitch to the halfback.  This is also the turbo boost button when you're performing a running play.  Unfortunately, the QB in an option play will not be able to turbo boost even after crossing the line of scrimmage as the button is bound to pitch the halfback.  Although this won't be a problem if your team doesn't run the option often (i.e. USC), this can be a major setback especially if you've got a speedy QB that makes the option a true weapon (i.e Clemson).  Most of all, the option is a big part of the college game, and NCAA 2K2's system makes it difficult to run this exciting play properly. NCAA 2K2 sports some good extra modes and beyond the online play - as good and sometimes better than NFL 2K1 - you've got several modes including scrimmage mode that lets you practice certain plays till you feel satisfied, tournament mode, a single season mode, and of course, the legacy mode.  Like other franchise modes, the legacy mode allows you to take control as athletic director where you make management changes, recruit new freshmen, redshirt players, and if you like, you can even take control of the game as you wish.  Recruiting is a pretty simple system where you're given five visits for every week in a five-week period.  There are tons of new recruits and you can sort them through rank, school they favor, player rating, and other stats.  You essentially have to visit the players a couple of times and most of the time, I always got the recruits I wanted.  Once done, you select four areas - strength, speed, endurance, and skill - for each of your players to concentrate on.  This allows you to build the team to your specifications and it's pretty cool to watch new recruited freshmen grow into potential Heisman candidates.  It's not as involving or complex as EA's NCAA 2002 franchise system, but overall, it'll give most college fanatics something to get engrossed into for months to come.  Although it's not a huge part of the game, sounds can either enhance or diminish the college excitement.  NCAA 2K2 is the latter; the commentary shines in some instances, but during the actual game, it's quite poor.  I was pleasantly surprised when, at the start of a Stanford Vs. Cal game, the commentators went into great detail about the history of the rivalry even talking about the famous incident when Cal scored the last touchdown as the Stanford marching band strolled on the field (known as ~The Play~).  However, the commentators often make mistakes calling junior and senior quarterbacks as ~young freshmen that need seasoning.~  Of course, the fight songs play a pretty big role in college football and NCAA 2K2 couldn't get all the fight songs from every university.  I can totally accept that, but what I can't accept is when the wrong fight song plays.  There's something very wrong when I'm playing FSU and Miami, and the Notre Dame fight song blares out.  For that matter, the game also repeats certain songs over and over again; don't be surprised to hear ~She'll Be Coming Around The Mountain~ three times in a row.    As I stated above, NCAA College Football 2K2 is a solid football game, but it's only a decent college football game.  Authentic stadium designs, fine online play, and solid football gameplay just aren't enough when you leave out some major pieces of college football.  Most importantly, when I was playing NCAA 2K2 it just didn't feel as if I was playing college football - the spirit and excitement of defending your school's pride just wasn't there.  And it's not because the game is missing the major BCS bowl games (the Rose Bowl is in there)EI just felt like I was playing a normal football game, not a college one.  It doesn't help that NCAA 2K2 isn't as polished as it should be when it comes to visuals either.  Hopefully, VC will learn from their mistakes and make the next one a game the truly inspires school - and SEGA Sports - spirit.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Aug 31, 2001"}
