Nearly a half-decade and six versions later, Nintendo ups the ante with the first Game Boy Advance-exclusive edition of the Pokemon brand; it's already sold out the wazoo in Japan since its November 2002 release, and even though it may seem like it's sold based upon brilliant marketing alone, the Pokemon RPG franchise is actually a fantastic and well-designed gaming experience. It not only has extensive variety in its adventure, it's chock full of strategy and it will consume a whole lot of time due to its addictive ~gotta catch 'em all~ motif. The GBA game expands on an already successful design, and its only mark against it is the designers' failure to advance the game's visuals as far as it did the gameplay. Features More than 350 Pokemon to collect, battle and trade 40 hour quest Cartridge save (one slot) Connectivity with future GameCube game(s) Link cable support for four player (multiple cartridge) e-Reader compatibility Only for Game Boy Advance Pokemon: Sapphire Version and Pokemon: Ruby Version are the official sequel to the RPG released on the Game Boy and Game Boy Color in various ~colors~: Red, Blue, and Yellow on the Game Boy; Gold, Silver, and Crystal on the Game Boy Color. Though there have been six games in the series on the past Game Boy systems, Ruby and Sapphire are among the third drastic extension of the Pokemon adventure.  Just for the folks unlearned in the ways of Pokemon: in the Pokemon series, players assume the role of an up-and-coming Pokemon trainer. Pokemon are are among the class of various creatures who live in harmony with humans, from bird to bug to fish to...puppet. Players work their way through the land, going from town to town, using their skills to capture Pokemon in the wild to do their bidding against other Pokemon trainers. Successful battles between Pokemon will strengthen those creatures, and the higher their level, the more powerful they can be. When a player's set of Pokemon is at a certain level, they can attempt to challenge the town's Pokemon Gym leader. The leader holds a specific badge for Pokemon trainers to collect, and by defeating this leader, players earn that badge and the abilities that the badge holds. By collecting all eight gym badges, players will earn that coveted Pokemon Master title. But the game doesn't end there, as Ruby and Sapphire are almost separate lives; there's so much to do beyond the standard adventure, including separate tasks like beauty contests, as well as mini-games that both can be played solo or with as many as three other Pokemon players. Pokemon: Sapphire Version and Pokemon: Ruby Version feature extremely deep game design that will suck up a lot of players' gaming time. And that's a really good thing, folks.  Just as the first official Pokemon sequels (Gold, Silver, and Crystal) added a hundred new Pokemon to the original mix of 151 critters from Red, Blue, and Yellow, Pokemon: Sapphire Version and Pokemon: Ruby Version offer another hundred or so more Pokemon on top of the pile. And just like the other previous critter additions to the series, some of these creature designs range from the very cool to the very stupid, but discovering these new guys is definitely an adventure in itself. One of the fun aspects of Pokemon has always been encountering and discovering creatures that you haven't been seen before, and with the addition of the several dozen to Sapphire and Ruby there's a lot of that element in place...especially for folks who have yet to play a Pokemon title. More than 350 creatures to encounter, collect, fight and trade is a mighty impressive number. Pokemon: Ruby Edition and Pokemon: Sapphire Edition are, at their core, the same game. But there are subtle differences throughout the two adventures. Within these two games' storyline, there are two rival Pokemon teams: Team Aqua, and Team Magma. In Sapphire, Team Aqua's trying to flood the world to make it more inhabitable for water Pokemon, with Team Magma trying to stop them. In Ruby, it's the other way around, with Team Magma trying to overflow the world in lava for the Fire-based Pokemon to live. The main quest's the same in both games, though...but like the previous Pokemon games, only certain creatures can be caught in each version of the game. Some Pokemon can only be caught in Sapphire, and others can only be caught in Ruby. This encourages either, A) playing both versions of the game, or B) finding someone with the other copy of the game and trading Pokemon between the two. It's a brilliant marketing ploy that's been copied by other Game Boy RPG publishers.     Diehard Pokemon fans will no doubt be frustrated to discover that their menagerie of critters in Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, and Crystal has to remain in the past. Due to technical reasons, players who gave up half their lives to completing their collection in previous editions of the Pokemon RPG design will have to do it all over again in Ruby and Sapphire; it is impossible to trade creatures between the 8-bit versions and the brand-new GBA-specific Pokemon.  Yes, it does suck that players will have to retire that collection after spending hundreds upon hundreds of hours on it, but to be honest there's so much to see and discover in Ruby and Sapphire that it would be a disservice to the game designers to move over uber-strength Pokemon right from the get-go just to speed through this adventure that will take most people a good 40 hours to complete.  The Pokemon design has always involved a lot of strategy, as players would have to learn which type of Pokemon works best against other types of Pokemon. And with more than 350 different creatures to have in a player's collection, this encourages a large variety of teams to create. This new design features a ton more strategy thanks to a few additions to the gameplay. The most obvious addition is, of course, the new two-on-two battles; in these, players will have to toss out two different Pokemon to battle the opposing creatures. This feature isn't hugely different from the one-on-one battles, but they do add a bit to the strategy since some attacks will affect either one or both, or even the partner Pokemon, and players will have to learn which attacks are best during these different types of battles.  The game also allows Pokemon to utilize moves of different types; a flying Pokemon can now have grass or electric attacks in its arsenal. Players can hand items to Pokemon that can be used for battle; berries found in the wild (another addition to the adventure) have specific Pokemon-enhancing attributes (such as increasing health points or a move's power points, removing poison or burn). And if trainers give these items to hold during a battle, the Pokemon can put them to use when it's needed, automatically. There are other ~hold~ items to put to use in the adventure, from items that increase attacks or defenses, shares experience points with inactive Pokemon, even doubles the money that's awarded at the end of a battle. Discovering how to use these items during battle (as well as trying to figure out if the other players' Pokemon holds specific items) adds a whole bunch to the overall challenge and strategies of Pokemon.  And the designers even added a few new elements to the adventure that's separate from the main quest. Players can enter their Pokemon into ~beauty contests,~ using their battle moves to ~wow~ the judges and spook out the other competing Pokemon. But to prepare the creature for the judging, players must create PokeBlock treats using berries found in the wild. These treats are created by hopping over to a Berry Blender and working with other trainers in a challenging, basic-but-fun mini-game. The Blender spins around in a circle, and each player involved must hit the A button in time to when the blender's arrow hits the player's ~notch~. As everyone works together and successfully times their button presses, the blender spins faster and faster; the quicker the speed, the more potent the PokeBlock. These treats are then fed to the Pokemon, which improves their condition for these competitions. Incidentally, the Berry Blender mini-game can be played with four Pokemon players through the use of the link cable.    Like the previous games, there's a casino in Ruby and Sapphire to earn coins that will award players special moves to assign a Pokemon. Returning to the casino is a slot machine mini-game, and new to the adventure is a clever roulette challenge where players guess which slot a silver ball's going to drop. But as many as five balls remain in play, blocking that slot...so the strategy of selecting the right slot increases. These two casino mini-games are really well done on the GBA system, and I'm almost surprised that the ESRB didn't come down on Nintendo with a ~Teen~ rating for ~gambling.~     There is even support for Nintendo's e-Reader peripheral that will enable gamers with the proper equipment to fight additional trainers by swiping specially encoded cards...one of which is included with each copy of Pokemon: Ruby Version and Pokemon: Sapphire Version Since these cards feature trainers with 50-level Pokemon, this feature won't open up to users until deep into the adventure. It's obvious that this feature is for the truly diehard Pokemon fan, but it's a great addition to the Pokemon design that puts the e-Reader to very clever use.  And even the little things in the game add up to make up a seriously impressive Pokemon experience. The game not only allows players to collect and name more than 400 creatures, it also remembers which Pokeball was used to catch that creature; players will throw their Pokemon out in battle, and keen eyes will notice that the graphic used to represent the Pokeball is the proper style of ball that the player used to capture it. The Ruby and Sapphire game design also features a really clean interface, making it easy to look up individual Pokemon, as well as find out about all of the towns and roads that players have discovered along the way.  But where the developers focused on game features and designs, the graphics didn't receive quite the same royal treatment. After playing such vibrantly colorful and detailed games on the GBA system, it's a little on the disappointing side to experience the basic art style that's in Pokemon: Ruby Version and Pokemon: Sapphire Version. The overworld and battle graphics only received minor upgrades from the Game Boy Color version released two years ago. But to be fair, the game doesn't look that bad, with a better-than-average graphic style. The developers do throw in a few ~special effects~ to make sure that at least some of the GBA capabilities are put to use; water puddles have a simple-but-effective reflection, and sandy areas leave a temporary trail of footprints (or bike tire prints if you're riding one of the two vehicles in the adventure). Pokemon battles themselves are still of the same basic slideshow fair of the previous games, but at least the GBA's hardware can do more to make the Pokemon seem more ~alive~; certain attacks will cause the Pokemon sprites to grow or rotate, even adding a few background effects to spice up the action. The sound quality is a bit of a mixed bag; the music and tune composition is definitely of high quality that touches upon SNES quality of audio. But the sound effects, most notably the samples of each of the 350+ Pokemon in the game, are just about what was offered on the past Pokemon games. Don't expect the cartoon voices of all the Pokemon; there's only so much a GBA cart can hold, and this game's already jam-packed with tons of features.  Also, the GBA game removes one of the coolest features that Nintendo introduced in the Gold/Silver/Crystal series: time-based events. Ruby and Sapphire include a real-time clock that can be set at the beginning of the adventure, but it doesn't seem to have any immediate effects on the adventure; apparently it's simply tied to the growth of the berries in the wilderness, but that's it. In the past clock-based Pokemon, events would happen on specific days of the week and at certain times, adding a unique element to the RPG experience. This feature is sorely missing in Ruby and Sapphire.It doesn't matter what I say in this review, as Pokemon for the Game Boy Advance will, without a doubt, be a massive success. In fact, if you're reading this, I'm willing to bet that either A) you already intend on picking up a copy, or B) you've already picked up a copy of the game. I will have no problem going on record as saying that the GBA version of Pokemon will be the top-selling videogame released in 2003...for all systems. There's no doubt here that this game will sell like gangbusters.But regardless of the fact that a Pokemon game is pretty much a license to print money, this is one of the most involved RPG titles released, and one hell of a ride on the Game Boy Advance. Nintendo took an already great design and made it better on the GBA, and while it's a bit more than a little disappointing to see a lack of focus in the graphics department, it's the sheer amount of ~stuff~ in the product that makes Pokemon for the Game Boy Advance a really, really great game. The adventure is incredibly long and involving, and even when the quest is over, the game isn't; players can still train and collect Pokemon to complete their collection, as well as take part in many multiplayer features through link cable networking.And if Nintendo utilizes Pokemon: Sapphire Version and Pokemon: Ruby Version in the same fashion that the company did with the previous Game Boy and Game Boy Color versions of Pokemon, it's a great gaming investment to pick up either or both versions of the GBA game. A console Pokemon title is forthcoming, and Nintendo's desire to link the GameCube and Game Boy Advance will net some interesting connectivity features and opportunities for all the creatures you catch in the Game Boy Advance game, and it would definitely be worth the while getting started before the NGC's Pokemon kick gets into full gear.", "date": "Mar 17, 2003"}
