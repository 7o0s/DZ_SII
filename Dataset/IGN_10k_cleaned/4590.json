It was the second of the series and by far my favorite. As that series fell into dormancy a few years back, the Combat Mission series arrived to offer just as much tactical challenge but in a 3D, more epic, turn-based format. Eric Young's Squad Assault: West Front is an extension and synthesis of both those series, successfully presenting the excitement and irrational logic of combat despite a number of fundamental problems in terms of presentation.   In broad terms, Squad Assault takes players from D-Day to the Liberation of France, offering both historical and speculative, ~what if~ type scenarios. Players taking a longer view can opt to play a few linked battles or entire operations. The action takes place in 3D at a tactical, mostly company-sized format. Though there are a lot of scenarios to choose from here, they're not ordered in terms of size or scope so you'll have to try out a few until you find one that matches your commitment level.    The player will take on either the Axis or Allied side in these engagements, leading his squads and platoons of infantry and armor against those of the enemy. Though you'll want to focus on fighting the enemy forces, ownership of victory locations is the primary goal here. Whether you're running from hedgerow to hedgerow or storming up the landing beaches at Normandy, there are a variety of locales here that pit the American and British forces against those of the Germans. You'll also have the rare opportunity to lead the Canadian and Free French forces into battle as well.   The focus here is on leading of historically modeled rifle squads and individual vehicles around the hedgerows and cottages of northern France. Your foot soldiers can hide in buildings, firing out of the windows at exposed enemies. Though windows are shown on the buildings, they're obviously abstracted, as your troops will be able to fire directly through the walls at any enemies in sight. It's usually advisable to wait until your infantry has fixed the enemy before you bring your tanks and other armored vehicles to bear. Since the tanks have relatively stronger armor in front and weaker armor in back, you'll need to bring them to the battle smartly.   You'll also have plenty of support on the map as well in the form of mortars and other types of weapons. Off-map resources like artillery, air, or naval strikes also exist for when you need to break through a particularly tough enemy strongpoint or disrupt an enemy advance. These work really well and, though the infantry is still the ~queen of the battlefield,~ you'll still need to learn how to combine the strengths of each unit type in order to gain the greatest advantage. This is where the game starts to move beyond the basic mechanics of moving guys around to become something challenging and rewarding.   It can also make the game a bit hot when running in continuous, real-time mode. There is an option to pause the game and issue orders periodically, but since there are no movement paths or target indicators, you'll have to have a good memory to coordinate and execute large actions. You do get small indicators that show you which of your own units are being fired on but you really need some sort of line or icon to show if your own units have acquired targets.    Napoleon and others have commented that the dominant sphere of conflict in real war is psychological. Squad Assault's morale model is pretty sophisticated but not terribly unusual for the type of game this is. Happy squads are those that are hidden from view, well rested and near supporting units. More interestingly, in the linked operations, you can rest veteran units that have become fatigued and thereby increase their effectiveness in subsequent battles.   The fact that combatants have almost never been on equal footing in terms of equipment and training presents a fundamental problem for makers of historical games; namely, how to balance forces for the good of the game while simultaneously reflecting the historical performance of forces. Some games search for a way to allow players to obtain victory within a losing battle. Others merely adjust the numbers of combatants or reduce the stronger side's effectiveness. It seems like some of the German tank weapons aren't as effective against Allied tanks as I've found in other games. Or maybe all Germans are kurzsichtig. I don't know.    Though I've gotten used to the way the camera works (which still seems kind of backwards despite my familiarity with it) there are some interface problems that still continue to annoy me. It's not always easy to select the right unit on a battlefield. Sure, you can grab whichever unit you want in a sec by using the unit window, I'd like to have seen a better way to grab a specific unit from the battlefield. And that's if you can even find them. They do have small icons over their heads, but you can't scale up the units or enable some sort of large, brightly colored base. It makes the game more realistic not to have a 20' sniper standing on a big blue tile but it makes it harder to read the battlefield at a glance.    Though the manual is comprehensive enough, it contains a ~read along with the tutorial section~ that's just tedious. I'm not sure why certain developers insist on putting tutorials in the game if they're going to rely on this method of explaining what you ought to be seeing on the screen. You'll soon learn what to do by jumping right into the main game and keeping the manual open to the hotkey shortcut page.    The unit models are really nice, probably the best of their kind for a game of this type. There may not be a lot of detail in the faces, but the uniforms and postures are remarkably believable. Animations are good too: soldiers realistically work the bolt on their rifles; machine gunners break down their tripods and store them before moving on to a new firing position; the wheels of tanks turn in time with the progress of the treads.    Most of the visual effects are well done. Flames and smoke rising from destroyed vehicles are good enough to sustain the illusion, and the small parts and bits of debris that fly off of vehicles heighten the realism. For the most part the environments are believable enough, though the blurry horizon beyond the edge of the actual play area may bother some players. Though the trees cast shadows, the buildings and vehicles don't and this tends to stand out. And while the weapon smoke is good, the smoke grenade and smoke round effects merely look like an artist has used a pencil to erase part of the screen.   I really like the authenticity of the sounds in the game. The distinctive sounds of each weapon and vehicle help to sell the experience. Voice work adds even more excitement and variety to the game. The only thing that really galls me is that the vehicle sounds don't seem to lower over distance. They'll be rumbling away in the middle of your screen but the second the view moves away from them, the sounds instantly drop out. Imagine not hearing armor coming up on your flank because your view is shifted just a bit too far to the side.    Once you've exhausted the fun of the single player scenarios, you can use the relatively accessible editor to set up your own engagements, even link them together into operations and campaigns. Multiplayer options are also available, letting two players go head-to-head in any of the scenarios. There's no option here to spawn instances of the game off of one disc so players with networked PCs will still need two copies of the game to play competitively.  The few presentation problems tend to keep the frustration level a bit high for me, higher at least than it is in titles like Close Combat or Combat Mission. Those are high bars to clear, admittedly, but, given that this title seems to resurrect the spirit of Close Combat while also taking advantage of the Combat Mission approach, I wish a few more conveniences had been adopted.If you can get past some of the awkwardness and confusion of the game's format and interface, there's an enjoyable game to be found. The few odd crash problems that some other gamers have seen haven't reared their head in my game but I definitely see a few snags here and there in terms of the overall smoothness of the game. That there's no way to lower (or raise) the basic resolution suggests that the game isn't as scalable as it could be.", "date": "Mar 26, 2004"}
