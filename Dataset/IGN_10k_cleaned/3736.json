And though the development team used Sega's title as inspiration, Road Rage had its moments but ultimately couldn't come close to the original Crazy Taxi design. It's a different story on the Game Boy Advance, though; players disappointed in the action and pace of the GBA Crazy Taxi: Catch a Ride might want to take a look at what THQ's brought to the system in the handheld port of Road Rage. Even though the game sorely lacks the Simpsons ~flavor~ that the console games flaunted, the GBA version is a surprisingly enjoyable, fast-paced action racer with a lot of gameplay modes and unlockables. Features 15 playable Simpsons characters Four Springfield districts 21 total Simpsons character appearances Road Rage, Performance, Sunday Drive, and Mission Modes Link cable support for two players (multiple cartridge) Password Save Only for Game Boy Advance  Mr. C. Montgomery Burns has bought out the Springfield Transit Corporation, converted all the buses to nuclear power and is charging an arm and a leg to anyone who wishes to use it. As opposition to this move by Mr. Burns, the fine people of Springfield have decided to offer shuttle service (as opposed to taxi service) to the stranded citizens of their lovely town with the goal of earning enough dough (about $1 million) to buy back the transit corporation from the evil Mr. Burns.  After selecting a character from the world of The Simpsons, players zoom around Springfield picking up passengers and taking them to their desired destination before the time limit runs out. Money is earned with each passenger, earning cash for not only getting them to their destination on time, but also hitting the target location as closely as possible, as early as possible. With some fares, there are bonus ~mini-games~ where players must get passengers to their location by performing a set task, such as destroying a specified amount of objects or by making it to the destination without hitting any traffic vehicle.   For the Game Boy Advance conversion of The Simpsons: Road Rage, THQ went to Altron, the Japanese studio previously responsible for the Game Boy Advance versions of Hot Wheels Burnin' Rubber and Virtua Tennis. The team consists of members who put together the excellent GT Advance series for MTO and THQ, which really shows in the studio's Road Rage project. This game obviously utilizes a modified version of the GT Advance 2: Rally Racing road technology; Road Rage features the same Mode 7-style engine that not only moves the terrain around the vehicle similar to games on the GBA such as Mario Kart: Super Circuit, but it also does some sort of image distortion to offer a believable hill effect so the world doesn't look flat as a pancake. Mmm...pancake. And the game pulls this technology off without a hitch, and even manages to throw a whole bunch of interactive objects on the road, like mailboxes, signs, cones, and trees, all while keeping up its fast pace and high framerate. The engine isn't quite as ambitious as Graphic State's 3D technology used in Crazy Taxi: Catch a Ride, but if you've ever seen that game in action, it's pretty clear why Altron went the route it did with The Simpsons Road Rage  The downside with this engine is, of course, its inability to handle 3D objects like buildings or houses, and these structures are definitely missing in Road Rage. The roads are lined with invisible walls instead of physical fencing, so players will find themselves bashing into nothing if they go off-course...but that's only half of the problem in this game. The track designers did their best to make locations distinct enough to have recognizable landmarks drawn on the terrain so players can know, at a glance, where they are on the map, but c'mon. Without buildings you'll never see Moe's Tavern. Or the Simpson's house. Or the Quik-E-Mart. Or the Power Plant. They're represented in the game with small signs or tiles on the road, but they can't take the place of a true, modeled Springfield.      But the game also lacks the Simpsons charm in another area: audio. Other than the MIDI-ified Simpsons themesong at the start of the game, Road Rage has no recognizable sounds from the television show. And that was really the only selling point of the original classic game: its sound bites written exclusively for the console game. Granted, the cartridge format is extremely limited with only eight megabytes to cram all the necessary code and graphics, but there isn't a single line blurted out by any character in this game. Not a single one.  But even with this disappointing lack of Simpsons-isms, Road Rage isn't half bad at all. In fact, it's the game's speed and over-the-top action that makes the game a lot of fun to play. The variety comes from the different Simpsons character's likes and dislikes as they're taken from one place to another; one character might enjoy careening into traffic, while another might favor running down the other Springfield pedestrians. Learning these slight nuances in personality is key in successfully scoring money in Road Rage. There are a ton of unlockables in the game, from the 15 different playable Simpsons characters, to three additional Springfield locations, to little extras in the Options menu. These extras are encouragement to keep on playing and earning cash, because it's pretty cool to see all the hidden stuff in the game.  But with all these game options, THQ again ~cheaped-out~ with a password save instead of a cartridge EEPROM. So while the players can record their progress and all their unlockables with an eight-character code, they won't be saving high-scores or other gameplay elements because the password just can't hold that much data. On the plus side, players can pull up the last earned password in the main menu, just in case. Something other developers should learn when the publishers force them to generate passwords for their own GBA projects. As poorly as the console versions of The Simpsons Road Rage ranked, I honestly didn't think the Game Boy Advance version was nearly as bad...in fact, there's a lot of fun, enjoyable modes in the GBA's game design, and it doesn't have a hard time being a better Crazy Taxi clone than the handheld version of Crazy Taxi. But it's both the lack of character and lack of cartridge save that hurt the product; without Simpsons catchphrases, it just feels like the Simpsons license was slapped onto an existing game design (which it was, honestly). And without the cartridge save, it makes it a far less friendly portable game design. Passwords just suck.", "date": "Jun 23, 2003"}
