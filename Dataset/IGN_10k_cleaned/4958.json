Each show seemingly caters to a specific desire shared by kids across the country. In the case of Fairly Oddparents, Nickelodeon encapsulates the most common of childhood fantasies. The show's main protagonist, a jumpy boy named Timmy, claims two fairies as unofficial Godparents. Whenever Timmy finds himself in a bind (or just plain bored) his fairy Godparents zap in from the ether and grant him wishes. I'm pretty sure everyone wants their very own fairy duo.   Taking into account the crazed imaginations of most kids, the premise in Fairly Odd Parents sounds entertaining to say the least. But does it make for an equally entertaining game experience? Well, the first digital outing came through Fairly Odd Parents: Breakin Da' Rules developed by Blitz Games and published by THQ. Critically, Breakin Da' Rules didn't do too well. Granted, its developers aimed for a younger audience, but much of the gameplay felt ripped from a number of other third-person platformers. On the up side, the personality of the show survived the translation, with the game boasting the same voice talents and quirky sense of humor seen in each episode.      Almost a year after the release of Fairly Odd Parents: Breakin Da' Rules, THQ has delivered Fairly Odd Parents: Shadow Showdown. Once again, you'll control Timmy (who seems stuck in a never-ending sugar high) as he battles the forces of badness. But let's get to the important stuff. Does the latest Fairly Odd Parents adventure exploit the wish-granting angle with an array of powers and abilities? Does the game juice the imaginative premise of the show for all it's worth? In short, does it somehow escape the fate of most cartoon-to-game translations?    While there is little doubt the action in Shadow Showdown may consume the attention of children, older gamers will need to look elsewhere. The game simply fails to conjure the kind of excitement found in other third-person platformers. Many of the mechanics found in the game have popped up dozens of times before. While this isn't a big problem in itself, it is a problem when a bulk of the gameplay in Shadow Showdown has been put to better use in other titles. I'm getting a little ahead of myself. We'll tackle each area of the game individually.    We'll even start on a positive note. Shadow Showdown makes good use of the Fairly Odd Parents series in terms of style, humor and setting. Considering the playful eccentricity displayed in shows like SpongeBob Squarepants and the Fairly Odd Parents, you could argue writers dreamed up much of Nickelodeon's current lineup during a frenzied acid trip. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. As long as networks keep pumping out edgy entertainment (if only by pre-teen standards,) who cares where they draw their inspiration?    Point being, Shadow Showdown makes good use of the creativity displayed by the Fairly Odd Parents television show. Throughout the game, you'll run amongst the same kinds of environments and experience the general ~oddness~ displayed during an episode of the cartoon. You'll also enjoy the same brand of ~wit~ from the Fairly Odd Parents (voiced by the same voice actors as in the show.) I'll even go so far as to say the dialogue is one of Shadow Showdown's high points, if only because helps tie the game to the series.    The game splits the action between seven main levels, each of which contains four stages (all but one, anyway.) While each level sports a different theme, each ends up feeling quite similar. The pastel villages of the first level affect the gameplay just as much as the darkened caves of later levels; which is not at all. The quirky design of environments ends up feel arbitrary, adding nothing in terms of depth and variety where it counts: gameplay. Sure, the kids will love it. After all, much of the game is colorful and funky. Older gamers, on the other hand, will see right through it.     The first level, ~Fairly Disastrous,~ summarizes the entire game. It takes you through the pastel villages of the fairy kingdom on a mission to purge the land of an evil jester. As in dozens of other platformers, you'll need to jump, slide, push crates and stomp on enemies to succeed. Every technique employed in virtually every platformer since Mario 64 makes an appearance in Shadow Showdown. As was stated earlier, this isn't always a bad thing. But in this case, it is. Not because Shadow Showdown suffers from broken versions of tired game mechanics, but because it doesn't offer anything truly engaging.   Aside from pushing crates and stomping on enemies, the game throws in a variety of different game styles to shake things up. For example, you get to fly around using a glider in a level titled ~Take it On the Chin.~ Admittedly, using the glider does add a little variety. It's even for a little while. But it's far too little and ultimately winds up being rather shallow in terms of what you can actually do. Another example, this time during the ~Vickey Strikes Back~ level, sees you in command of a pinball as it ricochets within a pinball machine. Again, the stage offers a fleeting bit of fun; just nothing you would enjoy doing longer than the level requires.     And what of the wish-granting abilities of the Odd Parents themselves? Well, it turns out their powers lack a little punch. Timmy needs to collect stars scattered about each level to activate a wish. For every three stars Timmy collects, the Fairly Odd Parents will grant one wish. Thing is, there really isn't much variety to Timmy's desires. See, where a normal kid would conjure a 27-foot flamethrower to aid him in his quest, Timmy wishes for more docile means of level progression.    While you can't expect Timmy to wish for a box of grenades, you can expect him to request something mildly cool; something that would fundamentally change the way a level pans out. But it never happens. Each wish is required to complete a certain area of the game, so you really don't have much of a choice. The game forces you to collect the required number of stars and then request the appropriate wish. And that's pretty much it.   Wishes end up being just another linear aspect of an already linear experience. With recent titles such as Viewtiful Joe, Blinx and even Prince of Persia, each of which offers the ability to alter reality, there's just no excuse to offer such limited choices in a game where wishes are meant to play such a large role. True, it is a game for kids. But even snot-nosed brats would love the ability to alter the game universe. At the very least, Timmy should get the opportunity to freeze time, become invisible or wield a giant mallet.    Graphics in Shadow Showdown suffer from low-res textures, rampant jaggies and general blandness. While the development team succeeds in creating a convincing ~cartoon look,~ it's nothing you could call exciting. The environments lack the detail of a modern platformer and most of it is non-interactive. The game also suffers from a lack of special special effects. The Fairly Odd Parents ~poofing~ in-and-out of existence winds up being some of the game's major sight gags.    As it stands, Fairly Odd Parents: Shadow Showdown doesnt offer more than the bare minimum. It squeaks by with bland, tired game mechanics and graphics that just dont hold up to todays gamer. Developer Blitz Games squanders the limitless possibilities of a properly implemented wish system and opts for a linear system instead. This game is only recommended for kids who care more for recognizable characters and authentic voice-overs than engaging gameplay.", "date": "Sep 8, 2004"}
