The conclusion we came up with for virtual Whiffle Ball: for the amount of money the game cost, you could run out and buy a dozen Whiffle Balls and bats and get far more enjoyment out of what the company made. That's the exact feeling we have for Original Frisbee Disc Sports: Ultimate & Golf - just spend the cash on Frisbee discs instead of this Nintendo DS rendition, and you'll get far more enjoyment. In fact, it's far more fun tossing the game box around like a Frisbee disc than playing the games withinand I'm sure that certainly wasn't the two companies' intentions...it's simply a side benefit for anyone who's been gifted with this god awful product.   Frisbee Discs are simple, plastic/rubber round things that can skim through the air at long distances, and over the years players have developed sports that revolve around tossing these circular toys moreso than in the usual game of ~catch.~ Frisbee Golf is exactly what is sounds like: chuck a Frisbee to a specific spot on a field in the fewest tosses as possible. Ultimate Frisbee is a little more elaborate, combining soccer, rugby and Aussie-rules football in a no-contact team sport of run, throw and catch.   For the Nintendo DS title, Destination and Skyworks were clearly concerned more with the brand of the game than the game itself. Original Frisbee Disc Sports: Ultimate & Golf is as barebones a production as you can get - boot up the game and you're faced with a two-selection menu front-end that loads up whichever one of the two games you want to play. No glitz, no glamour, no ~hey, check me out!~ presentation - just a menu that looks like some first year website designer slapped something together in about five minutes using a screenshot from each of the games. Which pretty much foreshadows the rest of the product.   Ultimate Frisbee sounds the most intriguing because, well, it's Frisbeebut EXTREME!! But holy crap, the game is near unplayable: the designers never let the gamer in on any rules or even a tutorial, forcing them to either read the freakin' manual for the poorly written directions (unlikely), or putter around the field and figure it all out on their own. Ultimately I chose the more realistic route and tried to learn the sport through hands-on play. Apparently, at least according to the Nintendo DS representation, in Ultimate Frisbee you can't run in a diagonal direction unless the Frisbee is cruising in the air. That's right, if you want to move up and across the Ultimate Frisbee field you'll need to push left, up, left, up, left, up like you were playing a horribly designed Japanese role-playing game. Most of the action takes place off-screen, so don't be alarmed when the camera abruptly changes to a different part of the field due to the game's inherent ability to lock onto whichever player holds onto the Frisbee. And player AI is the absolute pits, with computer teammates and opponents running to remote parts of the field instead of the location where you threw the Frisbee.      Ultimate Frisbee on the Nintendo DS is just flat-out terrible with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The Frisbee Golf portion, on the other hand, isn't as awful. Oh, it's still bad, but not nearly as unbearable to play as Ultimate Frisbee. It's a simple design: find a spot on the field you want to aim at, then flick the stylus and watch the Frisbee fly. It's golf on the Nintendo DS at its most basic: only 18 different holes, no stat trackingjust a barebones cartridge save that remembers the last hole you reached when you grew bored and turned the system off. You do have the option of using stylus ~flicking~ control or traditional ~two button~ shots of classic golf games, sure. But the Stylus control doesn't give you any visual cue of how hard your throw was, and the ~two button~ interface reeks of sloppy programming because the power bar never stops bouncing back and fortheven after you've chosen how hard your throw will be.   The huge problem in Frisbee Golf is the shoddy low-budget production where not even the most obvious of game design elements were ever taken into consideration. Accidentally select the wrong aiming location on the course or the wrong power? You're stuck. The programmers gave no way of backing out of the ~throw the Frisbee~ screen. How far was the last throw? Unless you can do the basic math and calculate how far away you were to the ~hole~ before and after the throw, you'll never know.    And please don't tell me that what's going on in either one of these games is too taxing to get working in single cartridge multiplayer. To compete against other Nintendo DS players, each system owner has to buy their own copy of the gameand that's just pissing your money away. Don't do it, guys.It's almost as if the company wants to encourage players to put down their Nintendo DS systems, and get outside to enjoy the real Frisbee experience. Which would be noble if it was really the case, which it isn't. In reality, Original Frisbee Disc Sports: Ultimate & Golf is a game that was quickly developed with very little quality control. Frisbee Golf is better than Ultimate Golf, but that's simply the Nintendo DS equivalent of picking which of your friends has the least stinky farts.", "date": "Oct 8, 2007"}
