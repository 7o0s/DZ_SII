World War II has seen more than its fair share of super soldiers capable of cursing their way through the grittiest and deadliest of battles. Vietnam and the Gulf Wars aren't strangers to the videogame adaptation either. Heck, mankind's entire history has been put up for grabs in Sid Meier's popular Civilization series. That's all fine. We're not sticklers for facts or realistic gameplay when the end result is fun. Yet, one might assume that a game with the History Channel's blessing would have more than just a passing resemblance to what actually happened. As it stands, there is little present in the game to give players the feel of being in a real Civil War battle.  This bland look at America's Civil War refrains from taking full advantage of the source material and winds up playing like a generic and oftentimes boring first-person shooter. The older hardware sported by the PS2 makes things worse. This version has less enemies and teammates on screen which makes the battlefield feel even more empty and can't push anything close to nice looking graphics.    The History Channel -- Civil War: A Nation Divided is not as bad the extended name sounds, but it is by no means a good game. The campaign allows one to play through bits of 12 battles with an equal amount of time spent as the Union as the Confederacy. Aside from which color enemy you're shooting at and the sound bytes that you hear from your fellow soldiers, there isn't any difference in the gameplay from either side of the battleline. Each level is book ended with a bit of historical fact to set up the battle and let you know the outcome, all done with the archetypal deep voice heard laying out details while you watch a series of maps, photographs and art slowly pan by. This far, the History Channel branding fits well and if it weren't for the game part in the middle, you could easily mistake these short intro and outro segments for parts of that channel's programming.    The Civil War has been largely ignored by game developers, probably with good reason. The weapons of the time period were time consuming to reload and not nearly as accurate as modern day guns. How weapon mechanics translate to a game is of the utmost importance to a first-person shooter of this nature. Standing around fiddling with your weapon and ammunition doesn't make for the most compelling of experiences. To belay this problem, the reload animation was made to have all of the right movements, but sped up to an impossibly fast rate. We're fairly certain nobody in the Civil War could reload a front-loading musket in a few seconds while running at top speed down a trail. It's a humorous sight, especially when you're several feet away from an enemy soldier doing the same thing. Who will reload the fastest? The suspense is killer!    It doesn't really matter who reloads first. You'll end up killing the computer controlled guy. This is thanks in large part to your super-soldier status which gives you the ability to absorb an ungodly amount of lead before everything fades to black. Along with your super strength comes the option to carry every weapon at once with hundreds of total rounds of ammunition.  These abilities take away any of the urgency reloading these guns should have on the battlefield and makes the melee combat feel like an afterthought.     The other reason it doesn't matter who reloads first is because the computer is sorely lacking in the AI department. The general AI routine is to stand in one place and fire at you as often as possible. If you get close enough, they'll charge and try a melee attack. This makes the majority of the game a boring shooting gallery of sorts. You see, every gun you have is perfectly accurate and can drop the enemy in one or two shots. When you train your sighting on them, your reticule glows red to indicate that you'll hit your mark. That means you can just sit back at a safe distance and fire when the targeting turns red for an easy kill every time.    You'll want to use this method of hanging back, too, since hiding behind objects for cover is hit or miss. Sometimes bullets will go right through walls, barrels, or even carriages. Even if you're moving around behind the cover, the enemy will know exactly where to train their sights. Hiding behind cover and watching your health go down as you take damage from an unknown assailant is not fun.   The lack of reliable cover and scripted moments where enemies appear out of nowhere ensures that you'll die often in the early stages of the game. This can make things extremely frustrating since there isn't a checkpoint system. You can save anywhere, but its up to you to pause the game and do so. Stopping to save after every skirmish doesn't exactly help to draw you into the game.   With every gun accurate across all distances and ammunition plentiful, using any of the weapons that don't have the ability to fire off more than a few rounds before reloading becomes pointless. It's sad, because the accurate gun models are the only thing in the game that make you feel like you're taking part in the Civil War in the first place. The actual war (maneuvering large armies, maintaining supply lines, mass battles with tens of thousands of soldiers) has been boiled down to a linear romp through trails and fields with small skirmishes that feel more like guerrilla fighting than a full blown war. Most missions task you with setting bombs at key places and shooting the small groups of enemies that pop up en route. Occasionally you're given a cannon or Gatling gun to fire, but those moments are brief and poorly scripted.        The small amount of fun you can get out of watching the humourous reload animations is lost in the midst of the poor AI and generic shooting. The long term appeal of the game is made worse still by the lack of any multiplayer or bonus modes. No deathmatch, no mini-games, nada. You'll be wanting the extra modes fairly quickly too since it only takes about five hours to finish every battle.    The PS2 version of Civil War suffered from some bugs that we didn't come across in the Xbox 360 version. Here, it isn't just the bullets that can clip through large objects. That little magic tricks also extends to AI controlled people who seemed to enjoy running directly through impassable objects such as cement walls. To say there are some clipping problems here is putting it nicely.    Don't be fooled by the nice looking screenshots on the back of the box. Those are from the Xbox 360 version. The PS2 build doesn't look anything like that. The pretty explosions and smoke effects on Xbox 360 have been replaced with tiny flares and wisps and have been greatly reduced in number. The lush fields filled with shrubs and tall grass have been filled in with flat, ugly textures. The trees are downright offensive.    The poor animations just make things worse. The death throes look rigid and are unmoving. It doesn't help that bodies disappear moments after their owners die. Even though these are contests where tens of thousands of deaths occurred, the battlefield looks empty at every point of the struggle.     The PS2 version of Civil War is especially bad in the empty battlefield category. Even with the poor AI and bad graphics, the PS2 can't put more than a few people on the screen at a time. Some engagements that were present in the 360 version were taken out entirely. Others have you face a much smaller contingency of enemies. Your teammates numbers are also reduced. The end result is a battlefield that is sorely lacking in action.   Although the rally calls seem to come out of thin air (you'll hear words of encouragement even after everyone in your small platoon has been wiped out), the overall sound work is passable. The explosions are the best part. Whether it's the blast of a cannonball fire or the pop of a pistol, the torched gunpowder sounds powerful and is one of the few things in the game that adds to the aura of war.  The History Channel and Civil War brand and theme are wrapped around a bland game that misses the mark in gameplay. There is little here to make it stand apart from the myriad other first-person shooters aside from the time period and little was done to incorporate that uniqueness into the game. Sure, you've got some historic weapons and rally cries you won't likely hear in another game. Yet, the shooting isn't fun and the gameplay doesn't do anything to bring the feel of the Civil War to life. While we're used to seeing the PS2 version of games look worse than their next-gen counterparts, The History Channel: Civil War still disappoints. The bland textures and poor explosions make the visual experience a bad one. Add in some severe clipping bugs and empty battlefields and you find that there is not much fun to be had here.", "date": "Dec 2, 2006"}
