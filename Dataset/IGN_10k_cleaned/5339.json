They certainly know how to milk a good thing to maximum effect. I am, of course, referring to their most recent installment of the immensely popular, critically acclaimed (and critically derided) Grand Theft Auto franchise. And the milking I am referring to is the game's massive (and this is not a word choice we use lightly, mind you) in-game soundtrack. Pumped up with more than 100 songs, it is perhaps one of the most comprehensivelet alone pervasivein-game soundtracks to date. That the designers set the music up via 11 different radio stations that you can dial into, was all the more ingenious.On the soundtrack tip, the Rockstar think tank saw fit to drop this cherry little double CD as a warm-up to/tide me over until the massively comprehensive 8-CD Deluxe Box Set drops in December. Beginning with Michael Hunter's retro inclined ~Theme From San Andreas,~ this comp is all swagger and stanky funk goodness, offset by a few instances of rock, reggae, and slick R&B. Hunter dishes out a perfectly crafted ode to late '70s/early '80s SoCal funkitude with his sinewy effort that owes as much to Ronnie Hudson as it does Warren G.That the slick funk bleeds into Rage Against The Machine's bona fide fist-waving classic ~Killing In The Name,~ is damn near brilliant segue manipulation, their thunder chug sonic violence providing the perfect compliment to the intro funk slink and the following funk pump of 2 Pac's ~I Don't Give A F@#k,~ which is all swagger and bump and probably one of the few tracks that expertly melds the beat to Pac's fluid pre-thug flow. Then it's James Brown's ~Payback,~ a funk juice classic, which slips into Ronnie Hudson's West Coast gurgle bender ~West Coast Poplock.~The album shifts mode a tad with Guy's slicked out contempo R&B ditty ~Groove Me,~ then flips the sonic script yet again as it dives into Eddie Money's guitar driven mid-tempo jam ~Two Tickets To Paradise.~ Disc One is rounded out by Cypress Hill's twisted ~How I Could Just Kill A Man,~ the Maytals slank infested reggae vibed ~Pressure Drop,~ Slick Rick's seminal storytelling rap escapade ~Children's Story,~ Rick James' funk rock electro classic ~Cold Blooded,~ and the down-tempo, almost dub oriented mild house flavorings of Raze's ~Break 4 Love.~Disc Two kicks off with The Ohio Players' tweaked out gem ~Funky Worm,~ which is perhaps one of the most sampled funk numbers on the planet. In what is probably an animal inclined segue of brilliance, the worm infused track is  followed closely by Heart's fuzz guitar fueled burner ~Barracuda.~ The invertebrate and tropical marine life allusions cease, however, on the next inclusion, ~Hood Took Me Under~ by one of the most underrated of the SoCal gangsta rap clans, Compton's Most Wanted. For those too young to remember CMP's reign, frontman MC Eiht damn near originated the languid, stoner drawl that Snoop Dogg would later rise to fame off of (much in the way that Busta Rhymes pioneered the raspy, weed choked growl that Ja Rule, DMX, and countless others unleashed in his wake). This is a slanted and enchanted gangsta classic that the Rockstar posse deserves props to for uncovering and including in the game.The classic funk continues with Lyn Collins, a femme fatale protg of James Brown, Ms. Collins lets loose with the heartfelt funk crooning on ~Think About It.~ The taut segue action continues as the disc rails into Public Enemy's incendiary ~Rebel Without A Pause~ before dipping into the ironically placed ~Midlife Crisis~ by Faith No More.~ I say ironically placed as every rebel, pause or no, must eventually encounter a crisis at the mid-point of their life. Kudos again to the Rockstar folks for choosing a less traveled number here (conventional wisdom would have called for ~Epic,~ but thankfully they eschewed convention).Bell Biv Devoe deliver their kinetic R&B contemporary pop blitz ~Poison,~ which along with Guy's effort may be one of the few somewhat out-of-place numbers on the disc, just in terms of its feel and mondo up-tempo glitz. Thankfully it seeps into the loping reggae step of Max Romeo & The Upsetters' ~Chase The Devil,~ with its low-end slumber groove and sing-song lilt. That this sets us up for Eric B. & Rakim's slow burn incineration ~I Know You Got Soul,~ is again another brilliant bit of play list manipulation. The album proper concludes with Willie Nelson's sad lament ~Crazy.~ A forgotten classic in the sense that the Nelson penned tune is best known for the version that helped launch the career and legend of Patsy Cline, it's a strange ending to the album, especially since it's the lone Country inclusion. This is really the only glaring (and somewhat jolting) segue on the album, as the song might have been better situated elsewhere in the mix. Still it's a classic and Nelson's high-pitched wimper vocals embody the richer, more introspective side of the genre.While ~Crazy~ is the official last track on Disc Two, there is a raucous cover of NIN's ~Head Like A Hole~ by AFI. This remake will no doubt appeal to fans of  the California combo, but for those musicphiles who like their covers to be over-the-top, it's pretty standard and by the books. Plus, as with Nelson's ~Crazy,~ it's an ill-fit in context with the rest of the album and would have fared much better being placed elsewhere on the discIn terms of the disc's packaging, it's an artistically appealing 4-panel fold-out that features an eye catching GTA:SA collage on the front, colorful track listings on the rear, and contrasting ~cop~ and ~thug~ illustrations inside. The discs themselves are aligned in a row, Disc One and Disc Two featuring interconnected images of gangstas embroiled in a side-by-side drive-by shootout. The bonus DVD is in stark black and placed next to the interior track listing (which includes song credits and album credits).If there are any complaints, other than the transition awkwardness of ~Crazy~ and ~Head Like A Hole,~ in regards to this introductory compilation they would be as follows: 1) does one really need to purchase this if they are going to also be included on the 8-CD box set? Probably not. Unless of course you absolutely want to get your greedy little paws on the Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Introduction movie. 2) The lack of liner notes kind of bummed me out, especially the fact that nowhere on the disc does it say which radio station each of the songs can be found on. Granted anybody who owns the game will have the manual and can look up such information, but it would have been nice to have been included with the CD nonetheless. 3) The double CD is heavy on the rap, funk, and R&B, but all but ignores the classic rock, reggae, house, and country with only a few exceptions (one lone Willie Nelson tune, one lone Heart tune and one lone Eddie Money tune, plus a lone Raze tune). Don't get me wrong, I love me some rap and funk, but it would have been a little more indicative of the in-game soundtrack to have included a broader mix. Come to think of it, it might have been cool to have made the double CD a bona fide mix-CD, complete with DJ babble and tight segues. But hey, in the light of the situation, these are minimal quibbles. The long and the short of it is that this introductory double CD is a pretty damn fine compilation, tailor made to be kept in the trunk and blasting out of the ride on either during repetitive cruising circuit or a long haul on the highway.Even with the blemishes Grand Theft Auto is a surprisingly fun and extensive game on the Game Boy Advance. The portable rendition retains much of what has made the series, starting with Grand Theft Auto III such a success on the PlayStation 2, and it's clear that Digital Eclipse understood the idea of the series...even in its 2D design. It's definitely one the most ambitious games created on the Game Boy Advance.I have no problem admitting that I thought that the original Grand Theft Auto and its sequel sucked; they were boring games on the PlayStation, and it was only when the series moved to 3D on the PlayStation 2 with Grand Theft Auto III that I really appreciated what the series had to offer. This 2D Game Boy Advance design, at the very least, vastly improves on the originals, and fixes the game so much that it's now a great, recommended action title. It was definitely worth the long wait.", "date": "Nov 23, 2004"}
