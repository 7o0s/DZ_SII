From endless nights killing Gnolls, Goblins, and Frogloks to scraping together enough platinum to buy that last piece of Crafted armor that my twinked warrior needs from the local item farmer, I have enjoyed every second of it. This past spring Verant released the first EverQuest expansion, The Ruins of Kunark, which added a new playable race (the Iksar) as well as tons of new zones to explore, items for the ~Uber Guilds~ to farm, and mobs to camp. The addiction was fueled even more. Not too long after Kunark's release, word slipped out about the second expansion, The Scars of Velious. After months of speculation, nothing could prepare Norrath for what was about to hit them: An expansion that exceeds the previous one in ways that are not quite apparent at first.  The icy continent of Velious lies to the South West of Antonica, and is a little smaller than Kunark, yet larger than Faydwer. Adventurers can reach the frozen land by either boarding a boat in Northern Ro, or getting a teleport from a friendly taxi...err...Druid or Wizard. Just as with Kunark, Velious is a land that has been completely isolated from the rest of the world for as long as anyone can remember. On the continent three races have been warring with each other for thousands of years.   First up is a race of dwarves known as the Coldain who have carved their own civilization out of the frozen continent. These little guys have evolved completely separated from their cousins on Faydwer, yet their civilization shares many striking similarities to the one you can see in Kaladim. You can encounter the Coldain in their city, Thurgadin, which can be found nestled in the Great Divide (try looking behind a waterfall...).  Next there are the Storm Giants, a thinner and more intelligent offshoot of the Hill Giants and Forest Giants that occupy the rest of Norrath. The Storm Giants have been warring with the Coldain, which is one reason the dwarves live underground in Velious. They even have their own city that is known as Kael Drakkel, which I would advise avoiding unless you build up your allegiance with them (more on this later).  Finally, the third major race on Velious are Dragons. Velious can be considered the home of Dragons on Norrath with the largest concentration of Dragons as well as the Ruling Council of Dragons in residence. The Western Wastes are the breeding grounds for these beasts, and it is there where you can find Dragons as yard trash (meaning there are more than enough to kill). They are also rumored to have their own city...  Before Velious was released, one of the big rumors going around was that the expansion would feature a linear zone structure much like the Plane of Air. In that zone, you must complete each island before moving onto the next. The first few zones of Velious aren't entirely linear, but they can be tricky to get to. For example, to get to the Wakening Land (the only non-snowy zone in the expansion and the location of the portal to the Plane of Growth) you have to pass through Kael Drakkel, which can be a very big pain if the giants do not like you. Once you get past those zones, you do get into the typical ~kill mob, find key, enter zone~ type situations that many areas of Kunark have.  That brings us to one of the cooler (no pun intended) things about Velious. You can choose to side with one of the three warring races to make yourself more welcome on the continent and to make traveling a little easier. The exact way to do this hasn't been discovered by players yet, but if it works like faction in the rest of the world all you will have to do is kill certain creatures or NPCs or do a quest or two.   The warring races issue has brought up one modification to how people play the game that some aren't too happy about. Normally when you die, you can have a friend go to your corpse and drag it out of danger. That won't work so well in Velious. If you die in an area where you are viewed as an enemy, and have a friend who is liked by that race try to drag your corpse out, they will be viewed as assisting the enemy and therefore attacked. This is only a minor setback that can you can get around using invisibility, unless the mob can see through that at which point you will be seeing ~LOADING  PLEASE WAIT~ once again...  As with Kunark before it, Velious brings new spells (starting at level 34), disciplines for the Hybrids (Paladins, Rangers, Shadow Knights, and Bards), new armor (complete with very cool graphics), and weapons. Out of those new toys, the weapons have one of the most unique features. On Velious there is a mineral known as Velium that is clear as ice, but tough as steel. The Coldain mine this mineral and their city is pretty much carved out of it. When you find or loot a Velium weapon, you will notice that is has a special ability. For example, I looted a Velium War Hammer off of a Ry'Gor Mystic in the Eastern Wastes. The weapon was basically a Fine Steel War Hammer, but it had a procing (meaning it randomly ~goes off~) effect called Velium Shards (most Velium weapons have this effect, which does 12 damage). The tricky thing with this is, if you take a Velium weapon off of Velious, they may not work as intended.  Call it a little feature to prevent people from going to Velious, farming tons of Velium weapons, then trying to sell them to newbies for 10x the price (although I have already seen this happen right after Velious went live).   Velious' story is also woven into the game a little better than Kunark's. While Kunark opened with the epic kidnapping of Firiona Vie by the Iksar, there is very little in the game that actually continues that story. With Velious, every time you board the pirate skiff in North Ro, there is a little Gnome pirate there to announce its arrival and departure to people on the docks. Little touches like that help to draw you into the game more.  Zone design in Velious is truly epic. Nearly every zone is a large as West Karana, and the creatures are extremely varied. Norrath finally has little fluffy bunnies that you can kill thanks to this expansion. If you want to hunt more dangerous foes, there are Gnolls, Manticors, Giants, Wurms (including caves full of them), Raptors, Drakes, Sirens, and more to camp and kill.  While on the subject of zones, there are also two brand new Planes for the high level players to have fun in. In addition to the aforementioned Plane of Growth (where Tunare resides), there is also the Plane of Mischief where players can encounter the King of Thieves himself  Bristlebane. You can access the Plane of Growth by touching a flower inside a tower in the Wakening Land. As for the Plane of Mischief, no one has found the portal yet, but word is that it will be a dollhouse-sized castle that randomly appears in two different zones.  Both of these planes are good aligned so the evil players won't have to worry about going to a plane to kill one of their gods.    Graphically, there have been some new improvements. Previously, all armors in EQ have been just a new mesh texture. In Velious there are helms that have look a lot more elaborate than stuff from the normal game and Kunark. Zones themselves have received a facelift with even more detail, tress, and special effects. The waterfalls that hide the Coldain city of Thurgadin are especially nice looking. While Kunark shipped quite silent (new sounds weren't implemented in time), Velious doesn't share the same fate. There are plenty of new ambient sounds such as swift wind and falling waterfalls, all of which sound great in comparison of what was in the previous game.  I saved talking about one of the biggest changes in Velious until last  the new interface enhancements. In the past couple of months, EQ users have noticed that the full screen windows could be moved around and resized. With Velious, that ability has been expanded even further. You are now able to access your inventory in a window while in the full screen view, and your ~main~ buttons (Walk, Invite, Disband, etc.) can also be accessed in that view. Even though people who don't buy Velious benefit from it, this is one of the best additions to the game in a very long time. You no longer have to switch resolutions (or view a very small window) to access your inventory while in a high res full screen mode, which is very nice. Finally, you can now run the game in 1280x1024  if you have the horsepower to do so.   All of this gets down to one question: How does it compare to Kunark? When the previous expansion was released, I criticized it for being not too accessible to lower level characters, even though there were zones for them there.  In order for a lower level character to reach the zones where they could hunt, they had to pass through a level 20 or 30 area. Velious is a bit different. The entire expansion is tooled for players above level 35 (although you can go there and get experience at 30), and there really is nothing there for people lower than those levels. Yet even with that in mind, the expansion on a whole is better than Kunark. The improved graphics, faction ideas, better integrated story (the three warring races), the new tricks with special items, two new Planes, and incredible user interface upgrades all make Velious an excellent addition to EverQuest. A third expansion was just briefly mentioned in an official message board post, so it appears as if Norrath will be going strong for quite a long while.  -- Jeremy Conrad       Want to share your opinions with the world?
