It was a bit of a rough start, requiring substantial hardware to run and lacking in some key elements, but it was a solid physics engine that ISI has been able to build on for the last couple of years.  The two audiences for this review are those that have a previous version of their F1 sim, and those that are new to it.  If you are wondering whether to upgrade, the immediate answer I would give is that if you like the one you have, I believe you should most definitely upgrade.  For this version, we've gotten ridiculously detailed telemetry, several more setup options, a hidden high fidelity physics model which can be enabled with a tweak to a configuration file, long replays, updated teams, drivers and tracks, and most notably, the drastic changes to the Nurburgring and Hockenheim circuits (these modifications are unique to the PC version, as the console versions sport the old tracks).  These changes alone will give you a lot more to work with than the version you have, so assuming you want to continue with the logical evolution of the title, this upgrade is for you.  However, if you do not already own an EA F1 title, think carefully about the other games you like before you buy this one.  Do you own and enjoy Grand Prix Legends or Papyrus' NASCAR series?  If so, you are probably in the right market for this one.  Outside of these titles, this the overall most complete physics model I've seen in a racing simulation.  That is good news and bad news.  The bad news is that if you're a casual arcade player, it's easy to get overwhelmed.  However, EA Sports has not forgotten about you.  Many assists and setup aids were put in the game to make it fun for anyone to race with, provided they have the patience to learn the tracks and race at whatever level of skill they possess.  But let's first look at the presentation of the title.  The game doesn't look substantially different from previous versions.  The game still sports very nice car models and track layouts.  The tracks stand out as excellent not so much for accuracy (they are fairly accurate for the most part, but I'm sure some people who look closely will spot flaws), but for the bumpiness of the track and the way it interacts with the car.  The bump coming down from Casino at Monaco is bad enough it'll launch your car, and you will probably want to drive around it, as real F1 drivers do.  Going up the hill at high speed at Suzuka starts out smooth but gets bumpier as you gain speed.  Force Feedback wheels really transmit this to you, so the circuits not only look great, but what you see is what you feel.  The graphics are indeed excellent, as you'll see from the screenshots, which don't do the game justice, because watching the cars in motion is so much better. One gripe I have with the graphics is the rain effects, they just aren't great. Even in monsoon conditions there is little plume of spray behind the cars, and the pavement doesn't exist the same pools of water and drying areas that were present in games like Grand Prix 3.    The replay presentation initially had me swearing because it, quite frankly, looked like a poor piece of work.  The car was jumping all over the place in the replay, as if the session had been recorded from an Internet session with lots of lag.  The car would hover over the track and sometimes sink into the track.  Yuck.  And this is a big deal to me because replays are half the fun of doing well in a race.  Then I discovered that my 'fidelity' setting was medium.  Not good.  I set it to ~Full~ and suddenly my car was no longer jumping around, but tracking just where I was driving and respecting the irregularities of the course surface.  In short, it went from being about 30% okay to about 90% okay.  I'm sure this hogs more disk space, memory and CPU cycles, but on my Pentium 1.7 Ghz it looked great.  It's just another reason why you want to have a pretty fast machine for this title.  With this configuration and a standard GeForce3 board, I was able to get 30+ frames per second with everything on, and dropped into the low 20's with a field of cars around me.   That's pretty darned good considering how much had to be turned off in previous versions to get the same results, even with what was then a standard PC.  No doubt hardware plays a role in this, but the programming appears to be better.  The detail in the game is incredible.  When you are in the pit lane, you'll see lights indicating whether the track is free or not (red means don't leave the pits).  If a car is coming down the straight that you're about to merge onto, you'll see flashing blue 'overtake' lights letting you know that a fast car is coming so you should watch out.  The sound is solid, but not spectacular.  The engine sounds and the sound of the cars around you is fine.  I do not like the sliding tires sound.  The tires don't squeal, they 'rub' in this game.  It makes judging corrections trickier than some other sims.  You also get a crew chief who will tell you a fair amount of information.  I think the engines and sound effects could be improved, but I also expect, based upon prior years' versions, that 3rd parties will address this with mods if they haven't already.  It is also somewhat annoying when a name is mispronounced, such as newcomer Takuma Sato, pronounced, Sahhto, and not Sayto, as the game does.  It's also amusing when you lock up your brakes and bump the car in front of you, only to have your crew chief tell you ~David Coulthard hit you,~ as if he was going backwards into you!      The car handling is excellent on the whole.  I have no doubt that this is a very complex and believable physics model.  My main issue with the game (and this is shared by others), is that at low speeds the car wants to swap ends, even when you're fairly delicate with the throttle.  It is definitely true that at low speeds you lose aerodynamics and ground effects, so all your grip is mechanical, e.g. the suspension and the tires.  This makes grip more difficult to find.  But getting the car to understeer or be neutral is much tougher, as the setups that come with the game generally trigger oversteer and lazy spins as you start to get through the turn.  This made me feel like I had to complete the turn before I could even think of putting down the throttle.  The classic late apex turn was difficult.  I eventually set traction control to high and made a few small setup tweaks to help dial more push into the car and was able to be a bit more 'proper' exiting corners without much oversteer.   I expect that people new to the game are going to find this to be the number one head-scratcher, as the 'fix' doesn't seem obvious and perhaps some people don't want to turn on traction control (even though the real drivers use it).  However, if you are willing to invest the time learning to 'feel' the car, the game rewards you quite nicely.  Go into a low speed corner and jump out of the throttle and the rear will want to slide out underneath you.  Gentle balancing of the throttle and brake is necessary, and if you're in the rain, expect to make a fair number of corrections.  Putting a wheel off doesn't cause the 'flypaper' effect that other games often do as a hack to keep you from cutting corners, and assuming things are pretty flat and you are going fairly straight, you can cut across a bit of grass or exit the corner a little too wide without incident.  This is too forgiving.  Grass is not known for its grip.  However, it is much better than the other sims that instantly drop your speed by 50mph for just touching dirt or grass.  The racing is excellent considering that we're dealing with AI cars.  Based upon their aggression level, they will either force their way through or wait for an opportunity.  Not enough aggression and it's fairly easy to hold them off.  Too much and they'll make banzai cuts inside of you or race wheel to wheel through a corner with you.  Finding the right level is a game in and of itself.  But I did find that drafting and passing worked nicely, and I felt pretty confident going side by side that if I presented myself to the driver I was passing he'd hold his line and not chop into me.  That worked pretty well most of the time. With the aggressiveness at 50-60%, the AI drivers' main problem was that they didn't get by backmarkers very quickly, allowing me to close the gap and perhaps even pass.  The backmarkers should be fixed to move over and lift off the gas a bit more.  In real life these guys would be getting penalties, and the lead-lap cars wouldn't have to get blocked so long behind them.  The telemetry deserves a mention here.  I don't want to get into too much detail, but suffice it to say that you can see just about any graph you want for a lap that you did, and compare it to a baseline lap.  This is more detail than I've ever seen in any game's telemetry, and is easily enough to fine tune your car, provided you can figure out how to go about using the telemetry.  You can also zoom into any corner in the track and examine your racing line, and compare it with other laps.   A good book on telemetry analysis is recommended, because EA provides you with all the graphs you want but very little in the way of usage.  The manual is very sparse on most items. The days of excellent manuals from Microprose and Sierra are over as far as EA is concerned, and that's really bad, because this game needs a proper reference manual and guide.  This is cost cutting at its worst.  You basically have to either understand the material or buy a book from somewhere else to learn it.  Check out the screenshot to see an example of telemetry.  By the way, I'm not that bad at Silverstone - I was driving in a very wet monsoon and the telemetry is comparing that to a dry lap hotfoot somewhere at ISI. No, really!  In terms of game modes, there is really not much to this game.  You can run a season, a single race, a test day, or do racing school, where you work on each track section by section until you've passed the tests.  In fact, a big annoyance of mine was that you could not save the game between sessions.  This is a big deal when you have four practice sessions, plus a qualify, warmup and race session, and every session lasts an hour, and there's no clock acceleration that I can find.  You exit and you lose your progress in that race, and if you don't you have to put in your laps and go find something to eat.  Of course, you can opt to just 'finish the session' and you'll see calculated finishing times, but if you were waiting to see if someone beat your time so you could go back out, forget it.  You'll have to wait in realtime or just see the final results with no opportunity to respond.  A notable feature in the game is the ability to alter the setup of the car by manipulating 4 main sliders for grip/speed, acceleration/top speed, soft/hard ride, and understeer/oversteer.  By just tweaking these sliders, the game will make setup adjustments for you, reducing or eliminating the need to fully understand the purpose of dampers, brake ducts, spring rates, anti-roll bars, etc.  Of course, once you're done with this, you can tune the car further and get into the telemetry to really apply real-world engineering knowledge to the car's setup.    Further, there are many aids designed to make the car more drivable.  You can independently adjust the rules by which the races are run, including the opponent aggressiveness and speed as percentages.  You can turn on opposite lock assistance to help keep the car from spinning, add levels of traction control, anti-lock brakes, stability control, and more.  Steering and braking assistance is also available, as is customizable damage levels.  This makes the game approachable to anyone who wants to race.  One criticism I've often had of racing sims is how unforgiving they are. You generally have a serious problem with the opponent speed percentage.  By setting it low enough to match your actual speed, if you make a mistake and spin out, you'll find yourself half a lap behind everyone else, driving what amounts to practice laps.  In a desperate effort to catch up, you'll probably make more mistakes and exacerbate the problem. This is in spite of the fact that technically you can match pace with the AI at that difficulty level.  The other alternative is to slow the opponent cars enough to where you can race with them in spite of your occasional mess-ups.  The problem here is that this means that when you are on the track, your overtake speeds are wrong, and the whole concept of racing approximately evenly matched cars goes out the window.  Instead of spending a couple of laps working out where you're slightly faster than the other car, you spend your time trying to fly through the field without slamming into a car that is just too ridiculously slow for you.  What did you think of F1 2002?  EA addressed this problem by making the AI drivers more ~Human.~  I noticed that there were accidents, car failures, and spins by the AI cars.  I had resigned myself to my current position only to have to evade a car that had just spun and stopped just around the next bend.  This made for realistic and exciting racing where I really didn't know what was going to happen next, so I just had to push hard and hope for some breaks along the way, and making the occasional small mistake didn't necessarily mean the end of my race.Overall, this is a hardcore sim fan's dream.  You'll be playing this one as long as you want, as it really doesn't get old for those who always feel like they can find another tenth with just more practice or more setup tweaks.  The racing is interesting and the whole game is very customizable.  I ran a full 90 minute race at Suzuka the other night and couldn't remember having so much fun racing since GPL online days.For people new to sims, the game offers to hold your hand quite a bit, and every bit of help should be taken, as the cars are quite difficult to drive well with all the aids turned off.  The game could lose some people due to frustration at the inability to master car handling and setup, or an inability to focus well over race distance.  This game can either make or break you as a sim driver.There are always innovations I wish to see that I do not as the games often 'play it safe'.  But insofar as EA has tried to take on the real thing with as many details possible with great graphics and a high fidelity physics model, they have succeeded.  F1 2002 is absolutely a sim that should be in any virtual sim racer's library, and should see at least as much play time as Grand Prix Legends did.Still some room to improve, but still the best F1 sim yet.  A must buy for anyone with an interest in a credible simulation of the cars and the sport.", "date": "Jul 8, 2002"}
