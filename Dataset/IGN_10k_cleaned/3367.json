Released for the Sega Saturn, Panzer Dragoon, Zwei, and Saga became some of the coolest titles in the gaming underground.  Never really mainstream, the series is almost mythical within the gaming community.  Far more people talk about Panzer than have actually played any of the titles.  As Sega continues to reach into their vault of past licenses, Panzer Dragoon Orta arrives to perhaps the widest American audience yet for the Panzer series.  A shooter with a solid storyline, stunning graphics, and great sound, Panzer Dragoon Orta looks to carry on the tradition of its predecessors.  For many, this will be their first real introduction to the series.  But don't worry, Panzer novices can still enjoy the game and those who played the earlier versions will almost certainly be pleased.  Panzer Dragoon Orta is the perfect way to start the new year and is the best rail shooter of all time.  Period.    Features Amazing graphics that truly show off the power of Xbox Ten levels of non-stop shooter action Bizarre creatures and gorgeous environments to experience Rating system to keep you replaying levels again and again A slew of additional material including extra levels and the original Panzer Dragoon Dolby Digital 5.1 Only on Xbox  Story Panzer Dragoon Orta is a fast-paced, almost non-stop action shooter.  But developer Smilebit took the time to also include a solid story.  Cut-scenes intermixed throughout the game tell the story of a young girl, Orta, who has been imprisoned for some time.  She is broken free from her prison by a mysterious dragon and from there must not only fight the scourge of the Empire, but discover the truth of her own destiny.  You can almost completely avoid all story elements in Panzer by pressing start during the cut-scenes.  However, if you do so you'll miss out on a well-told story.  More importantly, the story gives extra weight to each level.  It certainly has a Japanese flavor, but any fan of the earlier Panzers or anyone looking for more than just action, owes it to themselves to watch every well-rendered cut-scene.  If the story has one fault, is that it makes me long for a Panzer RPG even more.  How great would it have been to have a solid story, great gameplay, stellar graphics, and RPG elements? That would have many folks on cloud nine for a good long time.  Gameplay Panzer Dragoon Orta is a rail shooter, a rare type of game more popular in the '80s and early '90s.  They're uncommon nowadays as developers choose to go for more high-concept games, first-person shooters, and adventure titles.  A rail shooter means that the game is on a track.  While you can aim and move somewhat freely about the screen, you are pushed along a single path, which you must follow.  While it may sound limiting, the idea is to let you focus on shooting and not worry about getting lost or making a misstep and falling down a pit.    While Panzer Dragoon Orta is on rails, each level has at least one split, where you can take different paths.  The path you take simply depends on the direction you point.  These splits are not obvious and have no indicator, so you'll have to find them on your own.  But these aren't arbitrary path changes.  The paths will often put you in different surroundings, fighting different creatures.  Some paths may be easier than others, but that's for you to discover.  Panzer is heavy on shooting.  In fact, you'll have trouble finding many games where you do as much shooting as you do here.  But unlike most shooters, where you must always kill to survive, many of the enemies in Orta don't have to be shot in order to progress.  The point of Panzer isn't simply to beat a level or beat the game.  It's partly about experiencing the sights of Panzer's world and partly about replaying levels to attain better rankings.  There are plenty of creatures in Orta you won't have to kill.  But if you want a good rating (and you will want one, if this game is going to appeal to you), you'll need to shoot down as many enemies as possible.  That's, perhaps, what makes the Panzer formula so addictive.  For all of its beauty and dazzle, the gameplay is pretty simple.  You destroy and you try to avoid dying.  There are no pits to leap over, no puzzles to solve.  Your goal is to shoot down as many enemies as possible.  Orta is, essentially, a throwback to old school gaming when a game only took a few hours to pass, but the gameplay was so addictive that you played it again and again.  Like Frogger, Ms. Pac-Man, Super Mario Bros., Contra, or the original Sonic, Panzer Dragoon Orta has an intangible extra that makes it worth playing again and again.    Orta isn't quite as simple as I've made it sound.  Though the concept is quite basic (and that's a good thing), there are lots of small gameplay nuances you'll have to learn to become a true master.  I doubt anyone could pass Orta without stretching past the basic mechanics of shooting everything in sight.  You may make it through easy difficulty with basic maneuvers, but you'll never survive normal and hard modes without developing your gameplay strategy.  And if you want the best ratings, you'll need to use every trick in your dragon's arsenal.  Control Your dragon has three forms (Base Wing, Heavy Wing, and Glide Wing).  You can switch to each form whenever and as often as you like by pressing the Y button.  Each form has different strengths and weaknesses and you'll need to use each one in certain situations and against certain enemies if you hope to succeed.  On the surface, that doesn't sound too tough.  But let me assure you, when you're in the heat of a battle, you'll need to switch between forms quickly and often.    Targeting is pretty simple.  Just move the reticle with the left thumbstick.  In Base and Heavy Wing form you can hold down A, sweep over multiple targets and release A to fire homing missiles at them.  Tapping A offers single shots directly from Orta's gun.  In Glide Wing, there's no missiles, but you can shoot machine-gun rapid-fire shots at your enemies by holding down A.  Orta offers a 360 degree fighting environment, so you must attack enemies from your front, sides, and back.  You can move the targeting reticle around or switch your targeting 90 degrees with the left or right trigger.  Squeeze both to turn 180 degrees.  Again, the controls may seem simple enough, but gameplay will force you to maximize use of the controls.  For example, you may want to use your Heavy Wing when attacking a large ship.  The Heavy Wing does the most damage, so that makes sense since a battle cruiser can take a lot of punishment.  But when the ship fires a volley or twenty missiles at you, the Heavy Wing is the last dragon form you want.  While the Heavy and Basic Wings can lock on to multiple targets, they cannot lock on to missiles and other attacks.  Instead you must repeatedly press A to fire at incoming attacks.  But the fast and well-armored Glide Wing has machine-gun fire.  Hold down A and you can mow down just about anything coming at you.  With enemies constantly pressing the attack, you must switch forms often simply to avoid taking a lot of damage.  But you also have use of a speed boost.  By pressing X you get a short burst of speed.  While using speed burst, anything in your path is destroyed.  It's very effective against groups of enemies that pop up right in front of you.  But you don't have unlimited speed burst.  It must be recharged and, in fact, can only be used by the Base and Glide Wing.  You can also slow down with the B button to try and avoid an attack.    Speed is further used to gain the advantage on some enemies.  Certain enemies can be circled.  You can speed burst forward to get abreast or in front of them or drop speed to fall behind them.  Good for avoiding attacks and for targeting weak spots.  Changing speeds and forms effectively is paramount to nailing a good rating and simply surviving on normal and hard difficulties.  I played through Orta twice before I realized I could use my speed burst to take out a lot of different enemies on different occasions.  There are small dynamics in Panzer, such as this, that you don't necessarily have to utilize if you don't want to, but once you find a new strategy, the game changes for you.  Suddenly playing through a third time is quite different because I have a fuller arsenal.  It takes about a half hour or so to get fully used to the controls, but once you know them, they'll never leave you.  And you'll discover small nuances the longer you play, learning tricks to win, teaching yourself how to become a better player.  Power-up While much of your growth depends on you as a gamer learning the game, your dragon can power up throughout the adventure.  Certain enemies leave behind power-ups.  Whatever dragon form you're in when you fly over them will gain one experience point.  Get enough and that form will gain a level of experience, change slightly in appearance, and be a bit more bad-ass.  Get a form to a high enough level and you'll see a dramatic visual improvement, particularly with the Heavy Wing form.    It ain't so easy Smilebit proved with GUNVALKYRIE they weren't afraid to challenge gamers.  Well, they've done it again.  None of the three difficulty modes (easy, normal, hard) are a cake walk.  Even easy has some really tough spots, particularly towards the end.  Normal is very, very hard.  And hard, honestly, will be tough for even savvy veterans.  Panzer Dragoon Orta will challenge you.  But it never once frustrated me, which is a mark of truly great game design.  And kudos should be given to Smilebit for having the courage to make games tough, just like in the old days.  If you're looking for a walk in the park, perhaps you'd be better served getting off your butt and actually walking through a park.  Panzer is pretty, but it's no picnic.   A whole new world Placed up against most every other Xbox game currently out there, Panzer Dragoon Orta makes many of them look quite ordinary.  It's not that the gameplay is ingenious or the game itself complex, unique, or even new (it's hardly a stretch from the former versions), but the creatures and the environments in Orta are quite astounding.  The visuals become a part of the gameplay, because while half of the excitement is the constant action, a large part of playing Panzer Dragoon Orta is simply to be in awe of it.  The best way to compare it is to the first Jurassic Park movie.  Back when it came out, half the reason to see the movie was simply to watch those dinosaurs.  And people were in awe at that time, though it may be hard to realize that so many years later.  It's not that the movie was particularly great, but it was fascinating just to experience.  Panzer benefits from being a great game, but also from an impressive ~wow~ factor rarely seen in games.  It's almost like going on safari.  Well, one where you kill everything in sight.  That's where the multiple paths become really interesting.  Because taking one path over another shows you a different area and sometimes different creatures.  I kept taking the same path through Episode Five, a level where your injured dragon must run through snow-covered fields.  I loved the level -- watching odd mushroom creatures sprout up and seeing land sharks that literally burrowed through the ground, leapt into the air and attacked from above.  Then I took the alternate path and found myself completely surprised by the same level I'd played four or five times before.  Now giant flying manta rays were dropping dinosaurs from the sky as my dragon ran through ancient ruins in the middle of the night.  As much as you're a gamer playing Panzer Dragoon Orta, you become a tourist at some point, wanting to see what pretty little thing will pop up next.  And I don't think that same feeling, that same sense of visual exhilaration, could happen if the game wasn't on rails.    You're not the boss of me Along with these truly bizarre and original creatures, there are bosses for nearly every level.  Some bosses include giant battleships, a group of dragon riders, and one cool-looking giant skeletal beast that could almost be mistaken for an enormous cat.  Each boss has a ton of hit points and while each has patterns to them, they are all fun to fight.  Well, except for one.  The giant golden statue of Episode Four is an ugly smudge against Panzer Dragoon Orta.  Here you merely circle a giant statue as it makes slow and easy-to-dodge attacks.  While there are other bosses that don't offer chase-scenes, this one is incredibly tiresome and is the one weak spot among a slew of other fun bosses.  Actually, if there is one area that needed workin Orta, it would be Episode Four.  Not only is there a bad boss, there are some very confusing moments in the air.  As you dance around loads of Imperial fliers, the track takes you upside down, flips you around, zigs, zaps, loops, and spins you around so fast that it's almost impossible to figure out where to aim.  As soon as you turn to sight your enemy, you're going upside down again, losing all sight of them.  It's terribly annoying, but fortunately not something that happens during the rest of the game and is actually only a short part of Episode Four.  Extra! Extra! Panzer Dragoon Orta is a short ride.  It will only take a few hours to beat (particularly on easy).  The point of the game, however, isn't simply to beat it and move on to something else.  This is a game designed for you to fly through again and again, working to find new pathways, better your ratings, and unlock a slew of extras.  Smilebit has done a fantastic job of adding a ton of unlockables.  Not only can you play the original Panzer Dragoon (a port of the PC version), but there are intro and ending movies for the other Panzer games as well as tons of artwork, a world encyclopedia of locations, characters, and creatures, and a lot of short bonus levels.  A few bonus levels feature Orta and her dragon, but most follow the adventures of two other characters.  These offer different story perspectives and change things as far as control and feel.  Neither of these characters has a dragon to fly, so you've got to learn the difference in feel for their modes of transport and their weapons.  It's a nice side-jaunt, but isn't quite polished enough to offer the same thrills as the main game.    Graphics Panzer Dragoon Orta is the best looking game on Xbox.  That's not up for debate.  Watch the game in motion and you'll see that Orta takes Xbox graphics to a whole new level.  The creature and level design is as fantastic and bizarre as we've come to expect from Smilebit.  Giant flying ships take on personalities of their own and the many critters looking to do Orta harm are almost hard to kill -- wouldn't it be nice to just watch them fly around for a while?    And when you do kill them, there's no skimping.  Enemies explode showering the screen with particles, or flop to the ground as if they'd really been shot down.  Your attacks are a brilliant show of light with each form having individual effects.  The animations are as good as I've ever seen.  If those dinosaurs running wild and the giant winged beasts soaring overheard don't look real to you, you may need Lasik surgery.  Every visual in Orta seems nearly perfect.  Everything is richly textured and the lighting is phenomenal. The fluidity of the dragon wings, the enormous amount of particles flying about the screen, the eye-dazzling beserk attacks, and the richness of the entire universe make for a non-stop oggle-fest.  Panzer goes beyond being pretty.  As with the Saturn games, Sega has created a world that is unique and specific to the Panzer universe.  This isn't just some fancy light show, Panzer Dragoon Orta is a carefully crafted environment that deserves to live on in further sequels.   If I could give this game an 11 in graphics, I would.  Actually, forget the number you see below.  Consider it an 11.  This game is unbelievably gorgeous and the screenshots don't do it justice.  If this is the tip of the iceberg for Xbox, I pray I never go blind.  Sound It's clear that Smilebit wanted to keep a lot of similarities between Orta and previous Panzer titles.  That's perhaps most evident with the score, where several of the tracks seem like straight re-compositions of classic Panzer music.  There's a mixture of solid orchestral music and slight electronic beats.  It would have been nice if the score could have been even deeper, but what's there sounds great.  Sound effects are equally good with everything from high-pitched dragon screams to laser fire and explosions having the proper weight and volume.  The explosions and many of the other sound effects seem a bit too redundant however.  Perhaps a few more variations could have been recorded.  But this is really a nit-picky thing, something to point out since so much of the game is so well done.  And though there may not be quite as wide a range of sound effects as there could be, every sound is properly placed in the sound field with good use of 5.1 Dolby Digital.  As a dragon flying around there are almost always enemies from every direction and the environment comes alive as the sound swarms you from all sides.   Rail shooters, unfortunately, are a dying breed.  But Sega continues to put them out.  Rez, for PS2 and House of the Dead III for Xbox were both good shooters.  But Panzer is the best.  Addictive, fun, and fantastic, this one is a true demonstration of the power of Xbox.  You couldn't ask for a more beautiful game, and you won't find a better rail shooter anywhere.  Panzer doesn't try to do anything more than be the best rail shooter around.  It isn't trying to be better than Halo, it's not trying to be GTA: Vice City -- It's a rail shooter.  And for what it is, as limiting as some gamers may find it, it's about as good as it gets.Old school gamers and fans of that brand of gameplay and feel will probably be able to enjoy Orta a bit more.  Anyone who expects to get total control of a dragon, who wants to fly about like they're playing Crimson Skies may be disappointed at first.  This is a shooter on rails, not a dragon flight sim.  It's a fantastic game and as long as you go in knowing that the game is about multiple play-throughs, beating your own rankings, and enjoying a well-crafted world, then you should be able to enjoy and love Panzer Dragoon Orta.", "date": "Jan 10, 2003"}
