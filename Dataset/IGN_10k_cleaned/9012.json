It's seen some changes over the years but it's always essentially been the same Settlers game for all five (soon to be six) versions. With the new Gamestop exclusive Nintendo DS iteration, this is the first time since Settlers 2 that the game has been on anything but the PC. Considering how bad this venture has turned out, this may be the last time Settlers tries to move beyond the keyboard and mouse.    Looking at the facts, The Settlers seems like it should work. The touch screen controls should work well with a real time strategy game. Blue Byte developed it, who should know exactly how to handle the franchise it created. It's a Gamestop exclusive, which should... oh crap.     That's not to say that all Gamestop exclusives are bad games, though recent evidence would suggest otherwise. This is The Settlers, though! The series is practically classic and has a devoted fanbase, which makes it all the more painful to see it as a terrible bargain game that only one store even wants.    The Settlers, for those unfamiliar, is exactly what it sounds like. Players take control of a settlement, and help the townspeople expand, erecting necessary buildings, finding resources and, as of recently, fighting off enemies. It's somewhere between a real time strategy game, and a Sim title. For the DS version, three different single player gameplay styles are available: the Roman Campaign, the World Campaign and Freeplay Mode.    The game doesn't get much more exciting than this. Really. Enter the first problem. The Settlers has one game save slot. Gamers can play the title three different ways, but they can't switch between campaigns if they want to save. Immediately the game fences players in, forcing them to either play through one campaign or lose everything they've done so far. On top of that, the save and load times for The Settlers are unreasonably long. Load times on handhelds are practically a death sentence anyway, but watching the progress slowly creep up, and having to stop the game to wait for it to save really kills any sort of pacing the game had.    It'd be more understandable for a game to take so long to load if it was a graphics powerhouse, but The Settlers isn't even close. It does have some nice textures, and the environments are colorful, but everything having to do with the settlers themselves is mediocre, at best. Many of the buildings look nearly identical, so players will probably find themselves turning on the building name option just to tell what's what. The people sprites are really basic, and there aren't very many of them, so the same villager is standing around the village. The animations are pretty basic, but with everyone doing things simultaneously they don't need to be too complex.   With all these things happening at once, it seems like The Settlers would be a pretty busy game. Unfortunately the pacing is so slow it takes a while before anything really happens. The game mechanics are all there. Players help set up the town, and there are dozens of different building types, multiple resources to collect, and a variety of strategies. The Settlers is completely touch screen controlled. Players use the stylus to build roads, decide where buildings go, or direct citizens to areas. The controls work, mostly. A little too often the game won't recognize trying to tap onto a flag, which can make building roads a little frustrating. The menus are stylus controlled as well, so players have to hit the R button and bring the menu screen down to check that stuff out. It works, but mapping the menu controls to buttons might have been easier. Keeping the screens in one place instead of switching them anytime a player needs something seems like a better choice.   Losing control of the gameplay screen doesn't hinder the game though, because The Settlers goes mind numbingly slow. Even on the fast forward mode, the game is nearly unbearable. After hours playing the game, sometimes it doesn't feel like anything has even been accomplished. The goal system is a little too basic to be all that fulfilling (Find a new resource. Oh look you found gold.) and it certainly doesn't help that the game only has one song that  plays over and over. It's frustrating because logically, the game should work. All the basics are there, the things that made the games fun on the PC, yet when it's toned down and slowed down, it loses all of the charm. What's even more frustrating however is when the game crashes. That's right, after a couple hours, sometimes the game glitches out. It seems like the developers knew it too because every half hour the game reminds the player to save. It's like a punishment for the players that actually do manage to get into the game and don't want to stop to wait for the game to hurry up and save. The only thing worse than playing The Settlers for two hours and not accomplishing anything is having to play those same two hours again.Games like these usually get classified as ~only for the hardcore fan,~ but that's an insult to fans of The Settlers. The biggest fans of the game will be the ones that are most disappointed. It's not just that the game is bad, which it is. It's that the game is bad when for many reasons it should be good. The load times are ridiculous, the gameplay is tedious, and sometimes the thing crashes, so it's not even a functional game. In Blue Byte's defense, The Settlers is its first DS game, so maybe with any luck they'll go back and fix the problems, and make a game that does a decade's worth of PC titles justice. Oh, and make sure it's not only sold in Gamestop.", "date": "Sep 10, 2007"}
