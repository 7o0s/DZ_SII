{"name": "Slingo Quest", "name_review": "Slingo Quest Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/26/slingo-quest-review", "text": "Slingo is a certified phenom in the casual game space with millions of games played since the original debuted in 1995. The game isn't entirely unlike bingo, and as its Wikipedia entry states, bears slight shades of the old game show ~The Joker's Wild.~ After spending thirty minutes with Slingo Quest, the new mobile edition of the game from I-play, you'll see why the game has endured for so long. There is a compelling simplicity to the core game, and mercifully, the Quest part of this new release doesn't get in the way of what made the game so special to begin with.   In Slingo, you are given twenty turns to match as many squares as possible on your card. Each spin reveals five new numbers along the bottom of your grid; hopefully, you'll match at least one or two per turn. Depending on how many matches you make by the end of the twenty turns, you're awarded bonus points and you move on to the next card.   Slingo Quest offers a handful of features to augment the basic game mechanic, such as on-screen competition, patterns in the grid that offer even more bonus points when filled, and power-ups like jokers and point multipliers. None of these are complications that interfere with enjoying the core game, and in fact I really liked trying to match the changing patterns on each card for those extra points.   After adventuring across one island (there are ten islands in Slingo Quest), you start the competitive mode of the game. You must face off against a pirate that is also drawing numbers to fill in the card. To beat the pirate, you must fill in the pattern, fill in entire rows and columns, and hopefully uncover better power-ups, like point-rich coins. Watch out for the treasure chest -- I was often screwed by this power-up as it can either bolster your score or the pirate's score.    Slingo Quest is an attractive little game. I tested it on both a Sony Ericsson w810i and a Motorola RAZR V9. The game uses bright colors and nice backdrops, but never at the expense of giving you a clear view of the numbers and bonuses.   Admittedly, while I was certainly aware of Slingo before covering mobile, I wasn't necessarily a fan. Slingo Quest changed my mind. The heart of the game is devilishly simple, just like playing actual bingo, but the slot machine element really ratchets up the addictiveness. This was a game I would literally sit with for an hour at a time, drawing and matching numbers. I also found that it's just as fun to leave it on and play while attending to other business. (Except driving. Don't game and drive.) If you're looking for a cool casual game, Slingo Quest is a good download.", "date": "Nov 26, 2007"}
