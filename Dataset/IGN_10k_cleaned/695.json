{"name": "NHL 2K", "name_review": "NHL2K", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/09/nhl2k", "text": "Ever since the hockey gods first cut the sides off of a ball, picked up some crooked sticks and dropped a puck on that magic pond in the days of old, hockey has been evolving.  Over time, the sport has grown bigger, faster and--to the dismay of hockey purists--much, much meaner.  The same holds true of video game hockey.  It has grown in the same ways the real game has.  With each system and each new incarnation, it has inched closer and closer to the real experience.  Remember Ice Hockey for the NES?  Compare that with NHL 2000 for the PC.  Now that's progress.  We currently find ourselves in a new millennium at the other end of the Ice Hockey spectrum, staring down the barrel of Sega's newest entrant into video game hockey history: NHL2K. Sega Sports and Blackbox have been tooling way on this for quite a while now, and finally managed to sneak it out just after the All-Star game.  Invariably, there are two questions on everyone's mind.  1) Is it worth the wait? and 2) Does it live up to the amazing precedent set by the other Sega Sports titles?  The answer to both questions is a resounding ~sorta.~ Sega has delivered on its promise in one sense in that they have brought hockey fans a slick, fast and challenging title that will be a worthy addition to your Dreamcast sports collection.  That's not to say there aren't any problems, however, and though the game will appeal to most fans of hockey gaming, hardcore fans are sure to find some of the game's omissions near criminal.     A good example of this interesting conflict lies in the game's most import area: gameplay.  But let me start by telling you exactly where I am coming from.  When I play a hockey game, I want to make a cross-ice pass to a cutting wing and one-time it into an open sliver of the net.  I want to check when necessary, fight when furious.  I want to go five-hole.  If I make a bad pass, I expect to pay for it.  If I get an odd-man rush, I expect them to pay for it.  When I play a hockey game, I don't want to beat the goalie like a rented mule.  I want a poised, careful goaltender in the net.  That way, when I finally blow one by him, I'll feel as if I've done something.  You'd think these expectations aren't much.  But the thing is, what I'm asking for is a hockey game that more closely resembles reality.  And up until now, I haven't felt any game has come close to the real game experience.  NHL2K, for the most part, does.  Player movement is fluid and accurate.  The goaltenders react quickly and rarely get out of position.  The whole feel of the thing is authentic and, I must admit, relieving.  There was so much commotion surrounding this title, that I was happy when the final product lived up to (or in some cases, put to rest) the hype.  And how did it manage to do that?  Well, basically, this game is just fun.  There's nothing more rewarding than zipping a laser past the Dominator (although it's a rare occurrence, believe you me) or laying down a solid check in the corner.  As a one-player game, NHL2K is amazing.  As a two-player game, you'll be dusting off some of your favorite smack-talk as you take your friends to the house.  This game is kinetic and exciting--even the camera (ice level, now the default, is the best) contributes to the frenzied feel of the action.  It's evident that Blackbox has poured a lot of work into making this game as detail-packed as the rest of the Sega sports line-up, and though they fell short in a few areas we'll touch on later, they've made the game both challenging and fun from a gameplay standpoint, which should be more than enough to make it quite appealing to both casual hockey fans and diehard pucksters.  The key reason behind this appeal is the fact that they've managed to clean up some unrealistic elements in prior versions of video hockey. One area that stands out is game speed.  NHL2K has three speed settings, the fastest of which closely approximates what you might see by flicking on Hockey Night in Canada.  The speed isn't ridiculous, it isn't arcade speed.  It's hockey speed.  Don't get me wrong, this title has gained some pace since the beta, but you can't streak across the ice at the speed of light.  And you shouldn't be able to.  It's the fastest game on ice, alright.  But players are human, and that subtle fact is reflected here. You will be forced to set up in the zone and pass for the open shot, rather than rocket solo down the ice for countless breakaways.  In fact, the entire game is permeated by such attention to realism.  Keeping your players out for three solid shifts will make them dog-tired.  If you aren't rotating your lines, you won't keep up.  If you decide to try to stick-handle through a bunch of defenders, even if you are Mats Sundin, you will be denuded of the puck.  If you're down by a goal in the third and decide to take a passive offensive  approach, you won't win.  You'll be able to handle all the basic elements here: line changes, on-the-fly coaching strategies, your roster, the front office.  And while none of these things are new to hockey games, here they blend nicely into the flow of the game (except when the selection screens block on-ice action, a minor annoyance).  Choose exactly what you want to control from the get-go, or change horses in mid-stream.  If you want to be brave and control your own goalie, you can.  If you want to play coach (and to excel you'll have to), you can choose what formations and strategies to use as the game unfolds.  What this all boils down to is that the game feels like it should.  When you set up a power-play, you'll keep moving the puck around in the zone until you find an opening.  When you're on an odd-man rush, you'll have to decide whether to dump the puck off or take the shot yourself.  You'll have to decide whether to pull your goalie or not.  In short, you'll have to play the game.  In fact, the feel of skating and the flow of the gameplay is the best thing about this game.  Transitions happen seamlessly, plays unfold quickly.  If you're being held by an opposing player, you feel it (not on a jump-pack, though-for some inane reason NHL2K doesn't support it).  The first time you tumble to the ice, spin on your knees and come up shooting, you know that you're playing something wonderful.  The best part is, you'll really get the sense of connecting with players on the ice via the game's incredibly fluid control scheme. On-ice, the players perform the actions marvelously.  The motion-captured animations are fluid and natural.  Goalies lunge and butterfly, reach high to nab top shelf attempts.  Forwards dart and weave, cut to goal, dump.  When a player gets hit, he may fall flat on his back, he may do a swan-dive, he may spin on his knees. A solid check into the back boards will put your man on the ice and send the plexiglass trembling.  A hook finally looks like a hook.  When you cross-check, you'll pray the ref wasn't looking.  The player physics are impressive in their authenticity.  The controls themselves don't contain any surprises.  Pass, shoot, poke-check, check, speed burst, dump.  They do, however, respond quickly and, for the most part, accurately.  You'll still occasionally run into the age old hockey game problems of passing to the wrong man or not being able to select the player you want to control, but it wouldn't be a sports game without those frustrations, right?  Someday, someday...  Shot aim is controlled by the analog stick, and has the highest learning curve of all the controls.  In my opinion, it is a bit touchy.  Quite a few shots rang off the post or nestled in the goalie's lap before I got the hang of placing my shot accurately.  Backhand shots and one-timers take a little time to master, but once you learn them, they are fairly easy to perform consistently.    Fighting is here, but difficult to find.  I had to play through six or seven games to finally throw down.  The controls for fighting are simple, and the action itself looks amazing.  Depending on how you feel about fighting in hockey, you will be either angry or relieved that it doesn't have a stronger presence in the game.  There is no way to modify it either.  A sliding meter would have been nice to toggle the amount per game, but, alas, there is no such feature.  Guess the NHL is watching its image again, eh?  Oh, and violence buffs, we're sorry to say that penalties also can't be regulated, except to turn them on and off. Luckily, the refs let a lot go.  Just don't get too addicted to that hook/poke check button.    However, this little trend of limited customization points out another area NHL2K where needs a lot of help.  The developers have pre-set a level for everything.  You have very little control over the individual elements of game control.  Want to take a time out?  Me neither, but the thing is, it doesn't matter if you do or not, because it isn't here!  Want to regulate the number of fights?  You can't.  Want to play a shortened season?  Practice for that crucial breakaway?  Aaaaaaaannnnnngh!  Sorry.  The options in this game are downright pitiful.  If you thought Sega sports previous two outings were lacking, this game will make you insane.  So many basic conventions have been left out that it makes you wonder if these guys have ever seen another sports game before.  Obviously this isn't the case, but we're guessing that BlackBox decided to focus on gameplay first and put in the gravy when they got everything else in place. But apparently, this game got away from them like puck after an introduction to the boards and presentation became an after-thought to a timely release.  NHL2K plays a solid game of hockey for a first-gen game, but only by the rules it wants to.  Sega could have taken a bit more time to put more control into the hands of the players.  After all, we all want different things from the experience.  We're still scratching our heads over why they would even dare to deny us that right.   Even the replay feature is lacking.  It has all the basics, but that is all it has, taking a major step backwards from VC's excellent replay system.  you're pretty much limited to play, rewind, and zooming.  No fast forward, unwieldy slow-mo, and no lockable playback feature.  Ugh  On top of that, the game's collision is a bit suspect when you slow it down. On some one-timers, the puck never appears to touch the stick of the shooting player.  This is something you may never notice in real time, but is a bit disappointing.  Most of this is due to the huge collision boxes surrounding players, especially the goalies.  On certain replays the problem is more glaring than others.  This can get annoying, especially when it robs you of a goal.  Granted, if it wasn't this way, I'd be scoring 20 goals a game again, but there has to be a better way.  I guess what I'm ultimately saying here is that the level of detail is not as high as in NFL2K and NBA2K, and it can be a bit of a let-down.  All is not lost, as rosters hold up their end of the bargain. All NHL players are represented.  You know the drill by now.  Attributes have been assigned to each player, in order to represent their skills and personal style.  Theo Fleury is small and feisty, Jaromir Jagr is a scoring machine.  Curtis Joseph is crafty as all-get-out, certain other goalies are not.  Tie Domi and Matthew Barnaby will be more likely to get in a fight.  John LeClair will be more likely to score 50 goals.  NHL2K does a decent job at representing the differences between players.  Body types, height and faces types help to further distinguish individuals.  The area where you really get a sense of manipulating the attributes, however, is in creating your own player.  You get to play god here.  Well, almost.  Again, the feature is here, but limited in that ~why did they leave this out~ sense.  Let's revise the above statement and say you get to play mini-god.  Much better.  You can tweak each attribute, and there is no limit to the amount of skill you can give a created player, so you could technically jack up all the statistical categories to make yourself an uber-skater.  But why would you want to do that?  You control elements such as passing, acceleration, offense, size, etc.  For some reason, you have no chance to choose hair color, face type or (as I had previously understood) helmet and stick type.  Weak.  When you create a player, it is put into the free agent team, and you have to trade for the free agent (hint: trade for air).  Will someone please explain to me why they couldn't simply have included a separate free agent pool? A minor qualm, but still..what exactly were they thinking?  I guess they were more worried about what the game's computer controlled players were thinking, and the AI actually came out pretty well.  NHL2K is simple to learn, but difficult to master.  In order to beat the goosed-up All-Star setting, you'll not only have to be a skilled gamer, but know a little bit about hockey strategy to consistently win.  However, even on the Rookie difficulty, the game does not field embarrassing robot teams that give up 20 goals a game.  Nor does it allow your goalie to get thrashed.  It tempers sloppy play but doesn't punish you too much while you're learning.  The difficulty settings vary only in team strategy and player aggressiveness.  Goalie reaction time is cut down a tad in Rookie mode, as is defensive pressure overall.  Across the board, this difficulty system is merciful but challenging.  Last but not least in the gameplay department, I'll touch on modes.  NHL2K allows you to play an exhibition game, playoff series or season.  Unfortunately, season mode is confined to one team at a time.  You can only play (or choose not to play) the games for the team you selected at the beginning of the year.  In addition, you cannot play any non-selected games during any given week.  Perhaps there were memory concerns here, but it certainly would have been nice to take two teams through at the same time.  This was a great feature in NFL2K, and is sorely missed here.    But that's not all.  Also noticeably absent are any options for some sort of shortened season.  Practice and shoot out modes are also a no-show.  I've often used shoot-out to hone my shooting skills, and here that is even more necessary than usual.  It is just shy of inexplicable to release this game without these options.  Again, they seem to punish anyone who isn't a purist to the school of Blackbox options, and this is bound to piss a few of you off.  I think you get the idea.  This game plays well, but it plays by a limited set of rule.  One area, however, where it knows very little in the way of comparable limitations are the game's visuals. Like its Sega Sports predecessors, NHL2K is a looker.  Thousands of man-hours have gone into making this look like hockey should, and they paid off well.  The wonder starts with the environments you play in.  Arenas are packed with animated fans, the boards are emblazoned with ads.  Working jumbo-trons hang from the rafters.  The ice has that unreal-polished-glass-just-been-zambonied look.  Reflections shimmer on it under the lights.  But it doesn't stay this pristine for long.  One of the coolest features of this game are the real-time trails each player carves in the ice wherever he skates.  At the end of the game, the ice is chewed up and scribbled with skate marks.  Brilliant!  Reflections and shadows are also well-done.  Everything, from the board ads to the players in motion (especially in the side and action views) reflects on the glassy surface.  Shadows are well-matched to their counterparts, and add depth and richness to the image.  The plexiglass barrier that separates you from the fans is practically a living thing.  Plow someone into the boards and the glass bends and shakes. Drill a puck into it at the right angle and it will explode into a  mist. Great effects here.  What about the boys?  Hundreds of motion-captures have translated into beautiful player animations. During play, the motion is smooth and fast.  Skaters bob and weave on the surface, every body part absorbed in motion.  Goaltenders react with lightning speed, and actually look as if they're adjusting to the specific situation, rather than performing cookie-cutter moves to save.  When players pull up for a skate stop, ice sprays in an arch.  During breaks, players yell at the refs and each other.  Goalies shift and stretch in the crease.  Sega has paid lots of attention to detail here-richly recreating the on-ice experience.  Player faces are also impressive.  Lindros looks like...Lindros!  Over 800 faces have been mapped on to the players to add another layer of authenticity.  And all of these faces have been rigged to show emotion.  Just watch the disappointment as Owen Nolan heads to the penalty box...again.  The developers could have done a bit more with body types, however.  It seems that, like Ice Hockey on the NES, they simply chose from one of three boxy bods and stuck a corresponding face on each.  With such graphical excellence across the board, such a short cut sticks out considerably.  But how is the audio? Thwack.   Shhhhhkkt.  Blappp.  The sound in NHL2K is solid.  From the dull echo of the boards when you dump the puck in to the hiss of skates stopping, the sound lends even more authenticity to the NHL2K experience.  The game sound effects are crisp and accurate.  A wrist shot sounds different from a slap shot.  A check is a dull, visceral thud.  A great effort across the board, here.  The arena sounds are also well-done.  The arena announcer and in-house music are appropriately hollow.  Crank up the volume to hear the crowd swell and cheer as your Messier deeks the bejeesus out of their Tugnutt.  Uniformly, these sounds are well-done, but one is missing.  Come on, guys.  How about a siren when you score a home goal?  Is that too much to ask?  The games are called by Hall of Famer Bob Cole and ex-NHL coach Harry Neale, the hosts of National Hockey night in Canada.  The play-by-play follows the action nicely, but it doesn't do much else-in short, they didn't try to do too much.  I will give them this, though: I didn't notice any significant lag in the commentary, something that is difficult to perfect in a such a fast-paced sport.  The color comments do get a little weak with repeat play.  How many times a season can you hear the same goalie stats?  And, if you play an opposing team more than once, you'll be bored by the same anecdotes.  Someday they'll have a separate channel for play-by-play and color, but until then, we'll have to suffer with repeat performances of the same clips ad infinitum.  So...I've said a lot here, and a good bit of it is negative, but in the end, what should you make of all this?  The bottom line is, what is here is really, really tight.  Regardless of some faults, NHL2K is a great addition to the Sega pantheon and a respectable chapter in the hockey game lineage.  The great gameplay that has distinguished recent Dreamcast sports efforts is carried on here.  Was it worth the wait?  Yeah, I'd say so.  While it may not be all it could have been, this game is still an incredibly solid effort in the gameplay department, and will be more than worth any hockey fan's money.  --Chris Carle, IGN.com", "date": "Feb 9, 2000"}
