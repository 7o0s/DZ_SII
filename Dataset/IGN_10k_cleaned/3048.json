I'm sick of it. Somehow, companies out there manage to put out games that don't use any of the good points in economic management and park building games. Dino Island is just the latest in a long string of these types of games that make me want to turn my head and throw up from the sheer boredom of it all. I mean, good lord, put some creativity in your game. Not only is the game just not creative on the development side of things, but there's so little room for good amounts of creativity on the gameplay side that it makes me sadder than Steve when he had his wooby taken from him when he turned fifteen. All Dino Island manages to be is a crappy tycoon game with a slightly interesting gimmick that in practice isn't really all that interesting. In short, this game sucks, don't buy it for yourself or anyone you love. Those that want the long version can keep reading.   I was going to do one of those nifty video reviews of this one, but then I thought I'd be a little embarrassed to have a video of me taking a dump on the Internet. I keep saying in each and every tycoon game that comes out that I say this. And I'm going to keep saying it. There are too many of these games out there. Way too many. Somehow, someway, they seem to be making a profit, which is why we end up seeing games like this. I mean really, a game that makes Zoo Tycoon look like a masterpiece... what's next?   Dino Island, in short, is the Dr. Moreau of dinosaurs. You play the part of the foremost leading genetic engineering scientist in the world. That's right smarty, you could splice and dice anything that comes your way, just like Conan O'Brien and those ~If they mated~ segments. Seems the ~government~ has found it in their hearts to bring some ancient species back to life for the good of humanity. You've been brought on board to help the project along. In the beginning, all you want is to create some dinosaurs and study them. But you also get to dip your wick in the wax of genetic engineering to create your own dinosaurs. I'll get into that in a minute, but I'll just say right now that it sucks too. About twenty minutes into burgeoning scientific exploration, the ~government~ decides that the project is pretty expensive and tells you that you must turn these bastions of scientific research into amusement parks to pay for the cost of it all.    Let people onto the islands with all of these dangerous creatures they say. I say, fine, it's not like I care, the dinosaurs have no hope of escape because they're so bored from being in this game that they can't get up the energy. Really, building these parks is near fatal in the fun and creative category. First, you build an enclosure. These enclosures are built by dragging a box on the ground the size of the enclosure you want. I hope you like squares and rectangles because you'll be seeing a lot of them. Long and skinny, short and thick, long and thick, short and skinny... don't worry, no one's preferences have been left out of this genius piece of design. Once you've gone through the difficult task of creating such an interesting space for your dinosaurs to live in, you can place a food tray and observation towers for the guests to see your dinos. What's that? You wanted to add some interesting things to your enclosure? Too bad!   So now that you've got your prison all set up, you can stick some dinosaurs in it. Depending on what you're playing, you'll either have to buy a dino or use one of the ones that're sitting in your cooler. You know, the blue Coleman one sitting next to your lunchbox.  At the beginning of the game, you'll have to stick to the basic dinosaurs. After you've got a few, you can start mixing and matching them. Always wondered what a stegosaurus and a tyrannosaurus rex would look like if they had babies? Well you won't find out because these models are exceptionally crappy. But you will get your mix. You don't have to stop there though, you can also screw with your creation's DNA a bit more and change some of the attributes around. So you come out with a new and wonderful creature that does nothing special really. Sound like fun? I thought so. Of course, you can splice and dice your specially created creatures together as well and keep on creating a rather large number of new and wonderfully bad things.   Once you've got some dinos, you'll need to make some money with shops and entertainment, both of which consist of a really bad selection both artistically and numerically. You can also slip in some of the decorations and rest areas around your park that are also incredibly short on variety and interest.   Lastly, you need to create some shows to keep your guests entertained. These consist of making your dinosaurs, that all will have different attributes like speed, aggression, endurance and such run races and obstacle courses for your guests entertainment. Weeeee. You'll need to set up a schedule and pick dinos out of your collection to compete with each other. Once again, these shows will be drag and drop boxes. The only difference is that you can actually have some small bit of creativity in how you design the shows.    Speaking of guests, there are ten kinds that will visit your park, each of which have different wants and desires and all of which look categorically awful. I can't remember the last time I saw character models look this bad. Extreme Paintbrawl has nothing on these horrid pieces of trash. I reviewed Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 the other day, ragging on it a little because it didn't go to 3D. But this one should never have even entertained the thought.   There's nothing graphically or aurally impressive about anything in this title aside from the tiny cutscenes that were passably cute, but not near the uproarious masteries of humor that they were supposed to be. Even the interface, which they were trying to make cute, ends up being clunky and unfriendly.I've wasted enough of my time playing and writing about this game. There's nothing that would make me recommend it to anyone. Nothing. Go look elsewhere for anything at all and don't waste your money.", "date": "Oct 11, 2002"}
