The game, an action-adventure in the style of the franchise, immersed players in 3D environments and dared them to explore, kill some evil undead monstrosities and explore some more. Castlevania (64) featured its share of simplistic puzzles as well, plus it offered gamers the chance to play as two different characters, Reinhardt Schneider and Carrie Fernandez. The graphics were of first-generation quality, sometimes pretty, but never outstanding and often on the blurry and foggy side. While the game was ultimately still enjoyable, it didn't quite live up to the Castlevania name, especially after PlayStation owners received the marvelous Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  This year comes Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness, a pseudo sequel to the series' N64 original. We say pseudo because the game is more of an upgrade to last year's effort than it is a full-blown sequel, offering many of the same characters, weapons and even levels of Castlevania (64). But there are a few notable improvements worth mentioning, primarily the addition of a handful of new levels and characters, plus new storylines and different quests per character. Is it all worth another $60, though? As far as we're concerned, only if you've never played the original.  The Facts  Same 3D engine as Castlevania 64. Many of the same levels, characters, weapons and monsters from Castlevania 64. Game takes place eight years before Castlevania 64. Includes two new playable characters. Brand new levels and storyline. New weapons and three different levels of powerups for each. New in-game cut-scenes and music. 4MB Expansion Pak support for an optional high-resolution mode. Memory Pak compatible (ie: required).   Gameplay Eight years before Reinhardt Schneider and Carrie Fernandez do battle with the Dark Lord, man-beast Cornell comes home from travelling to find his village burned and his sister kidnapped. The powerful being, who possesses the unique ability to transform into a half-man, half-wolf character, immediately embarks upon a quest to free his sister from the clutches of whatever evil has taken her. Along the way, our hero eventually takes aid from familiar characters Reinhardt and Carrie, plus a newbie with a shotgun named Henry.   The storyline, as longtime readers will recall, is exactly what Konami had originally planned for Castlevania 64 and, due to time constraints, was unable to achieve. This can be said for much of the game, from its level design and weapon implementation to its enemies, boss characters, cut-scenes, storyline and overall quest. This semi-sequel was originally called Castlevania: Special Edition because, simply put, that's all it really is -- a much more complete version of Castlevania 64.  In the beginning, players have only one choice of character: Cornell. The werewolf like being can really be considered the main character of the game. His story comes equipped with full-blown cut-scenes and a real adventure, whereas our other heroes are primarily there to back up his quest and extend replay value. Like Castlevania 64, each character features a handful of unique levels to explore, but most of the areas in the game are shared.  Those who have already had a go with Castlevania 64 will find little difference in the way Legacy of Darkness plays. It's essentially the same game, remember, with new levels and characters. So, it moves at the same pace, features the same floaty control, the same selection of weapons (depending on character), etc, etc. Being a 3D adventure, most of the action revolves around the killing of roaming enemies in 3D environments, the flipping of switches to open up doorways, the collection of items to stay healthy and armed; basically all of the standard stuffing and nothing more.   The major problem is that there isn't enough new to warrant this sequel. We walk through the same levels and quickly grow bored. We see the same enemies. We see the same bosses that we've bested in Castlevania 64. A scarce few new characters and levels do not make us forget these issues. Perhaps worse, though, all of the flaws present in Castlevania 64, the sometimes awkward camera system, unintuitive controls, repetitive missions and first-generation 3D engine have gone uncorrected. One would think that, at the very least, some significant improvements would be made for the sequel, rather than the regurgitation of annoying shortcomings. Evidently this was too much to hope for.  Graphics Take Castlevania 64 and add new character models. Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Konami's Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness. As the game features all of the same code that powered the Nintendo 64 original (and nothing more), both look virtually identical -- and we really mean that. Not only do they sport a similar graphic style, but they actually feature the exact same levels, monster, enemies -- texture sets -- they've all been brought back to life for one more go. To its credit, Legacy of Darkness also includes a handful of exclusive levels and monsters, plus enhanced particle effects that enable prettier fire, explosions, projectiles and the like. In the end, we've got a title that is best described as ~visually first-generation.~ The blur is back, the fog is back and the slowdown is back. Not all is bad, though. Bosses are detailed and giant, 3D environments are still dark and moody, and the slowdown is never detrimental to gameplay. In the end, the title simply looks like Castlevania 64 before it and while that was okay a year ago, it definitely does not impress as the Nintendo 64 nears its technical peak.   Gamers will be happy to learn, however, that Konami has included 4MB Expansion Pak support for an optional high-resolution mode. The only problem is that, like Hybrid Heaven, the mode is damn near unplayable thanks to an unforgivably shoddy framerate that's too slow and frustrating to bother with. It's clear that the developer has not come to grips with Nintendo 64 from a technical standpoint.  Sound If there is one thing Konami knows, it's how to create some of the best music and sound effects for Nintendo 64. Castlevania 64's sound stood-out as it was clear and frighteningly loud. Legacy of Darkness continues the tradition with moody music that, while not on the same level as the orchestrated goodness of other Castlevania efforts for CD, is still of very high quality and enjoyable. Castlevania fans will be happy to hear that some of the classic tunes return during the opening cinema sequences. The sound effects are dead-on and often a lot more spooky than the sometimes silly looking 3D models they are voicing. All in all, a very well done soundtrack yet again. However, it should be noted that many of the sound samples, especially for monsters, have been reused from Castlevania 64. Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness is better than Castlevania 64. It features a more complete quest, more characters, more levels, weapons, cut-scenes, bosses and even 4MB Expansion Pak support. It's what Konami originally intended Castlevania 64 to be. And had Legacy of Darkness been Konami's only Castlevania offering, we might have enjoyed it a lot more. As it stands though, the game comes off as a rushed regurgitation of last year's offering, adding only a handful of new levels and characters and totally ignoring all of the shortcomings that weighed down Castlevania 64. And yet we're expected to shell out $60 more? No.  Castlevania 64 was already a tad outdated when it arrived last year. Legacy of Darkness, bringing almost nothing new to the table, is downright ancient. We shouldn't be forced to accept the same game twice and this is why we've given Legacy of Darkness a considerably lower score than Castlevania 64 despite the fact that it's the more complete title.Only recommended for those who have never played Castlevania 64.", "date": "Dec 10, 1999"}
