With your sword steadily clutched in your hand, you leap at the beast, eyes ablaze with hatred and fury.  The dragon chortles to himself as your attack is rendered impenetrable, and a swipe of his clawed forepaw sends you reeling back onto the ground, face-down in a pile of filth, your blade randomly cast into some askew location.  The wind bellows while it rushes past you, swallowing your hair in a mad flicker as you regain consciousness and rise to your feet.  Still, there stands the hulking, winged behemoth.  His head cocked to its side, the dragon flashes a toothy grin, bearing each one of his glorious, prized pearly whites.  The battle is fierce and far from finished.   To stand toe-to-toe with a dragon in the name of battle is a Dragon Valor's duty.  He must have courage, he must be valiant, and he must be willing to sacrifice himself for his cause.  Those of you yearning for the days of medieval times where such creatures were rumored to roam our land may don armor and wield a sword, all behind the safety of your television sets.  Namco presents an action-RPG suited to our dragon-hunting tastes.  Like many action-RPGs, Dragon Valor is one part role-playing game and 20 parts action.  Undeniably, it's a fun game along the lines of old side-scrolling treasures from yesteryear, but it's repetitive nature and lack of imagination kill it in the end.   Story You are Clovis, a Dragon Valor who has vowed to fulfill a destiny of adventure.  Vengeance has bound you to your quest, for your sister, Elena, has been slain by a legendary dragon.  With this in your mind, you seek to destroy the creature who has claimed your sibling's life.  To your advantage, you have a powerful sword enchanted by magic.  Standing in your way are guards, orcs, lizardmen, skeletons, and of course, dragons.  Will they stand a chance against your sense of revenge?  Or will they fall to the ground in a heap of lifelessness?   Dragon Valor is split up into several chapters that span two CDs.  During each of these chapters, there are numerous stages, which test your mettle. Every single chapter is predictably routine in its start and finish.  What happens in between is up in the air.  At the beginning of each chapter, your main character (always male) is presented with a challenge, which he must ultimately accomplish before you can progress on to the next set of stages.  Before a chapter ends, the hero falls in love with a young woman, makes her his queen, and breeds.  What inevitably results is the birth of a prince, who then becomes the next main character for you to control.  Clovis is not royalty at first.  He earns this at the end of the first chapter.   As the son of the previous chapter's hero, you have a lot to live up to.  Thankfully, all children in Clovis' family tree are expert swordsmen, and wield their blades well.  Since you're a new person, your hit points and magic points are greatly different from the last character you were.  In all cases, they are reduced greatly.  When a chapter draws to its end, you usually have upwards of 60 hit points, and sometimes much more.  When you start anew, your hit points tend to be in the 20s. This keeps the challenge fresh, although most stages are simple to complete without much danger.   Gameplay This is a game you can pick up and play like a pro without any prior experience.  With a big-ass sword like that at your disposal, thwacking enemies comes naturally.  The jumping slash is one the most effective attacks to unleash, and one of the easiest to perform.  I can never use it enough.  In addition to the small assortment of sword moves, you are also able to cast one of eight types of magic spells.  Heal restores your energy, Fire sends flame at your enemy, Thunder brings down a powerful lightning bolt, Stealth turns you temporarily invisible, Defense increases your amount of protection and area of attack, Ice damages and freezes foes, Mine explodes with a blast, and Vortex traps enemies, making them immobile.  There are up to three levels of strength to find for these spells.   The story in Dragon Valor is flat-out boring and easy to foretell. Fall in love with a girl, beat up a dragon, and defeat the enemies associated with it. Every villain in the game is intent on receiving the dragons' power, and serve them until they die. This doesn't bode well for you, because it makes things troubling.  It's fight, fight, fight until the end, my friends. What happens next? Who gives a damn?  It's fun!  The cutscenes which pair up with the plot are equally like to induce a yawn session, but the gameplay itself is solid.   In each level, you can break up barrels and boxes to find goodies that are added to your inventory.  This is where you pick up bonuses that are added to your maximum HP, MP, and strength.  You can also find them hidden in trees and other areas throughout the game.  Many items, such as chalices, scrolls, and jewels disappear when you switch off from one character to another.  Pendants, lithographs, rings, talismans, and earrings, however, are kept from one Chapter to the next.  There are also special items here and there that have no specific effects.  These may be sold in the shops.   If anything bothers me about Dragon Valor that would have to be its control. Your movement is limited to the basic eight directions, and it can prove difficult to turn around and hit your enemies exactly how you'd like.  In most levels, there are a ton of poisonous mushrooms all over the place. If you accidentally touch one, you are hurt and your movements become slowed for a small period of time. The game's controls make dodging them a challenge.  Things should have been tightened up a bit.   I can't help but wonder about some things, though.  Why, for instance, are you only allowed to push blocks in a linear path?  In the game's ~puzzles,~ you have to push blocks over switches, thus opening or closing a door.  These puzzles are so damn easy to figure out, though, because the blocks only move one of two ways.  If you can push the block from left to right, you won't be able to push it up or down.  Process of elimination, folks.  Just keep on pushing until something clicks.   The boss battles at the end of each chapter are what really makes playin the game worth it.  In the earlier chapters, the dragons are extremely easy to kill.  Their attacks follow a routine pattern and are simple to conquer.  Even the ice dragon, which takes some time to kill, is like a kitten once his technique has been exposed.  The one big thing to look forward to is duking it out with the big beasts.   Graphics The game looks okay, but it's far from stunning.  Some of the textures are very, very nice, but the blocky, exaggerated polygons are a turn-off.  The lizardmen, for example, look especially off.  Their feet are tremendous, to the extent where it's silly.  Volef, one of the mini-boss characters, looks absolutely ugly.  His head is oversized, and the texture on his face is laughable.  This can be said for some of the other people as well.   At least the dragons, for the most part, look cool.  I'd expect nothing less.  After all, they are dragons.  If Namco screwed up on their fire-breathing monsters, their credibility would have been hurt in my eyes.  You simply do not make a dragon that looks bad, you know?  It's just poor taste to do so.  They hurl just about every attack imaginable at you.  Fire, ice, shockwaves, and then some.   Sound Typical 'adrenaline-pumping' video game music is made to set the tempo for slashing through baddies.  Sometimes cheerful, others adventurous, it's good, but at the same time corny.  I didn't expect an epic score with deep, dramatic orchestration.  If I want that, I'll listen to Hans Zimmer's composure for Gladiator.  For what it's worth, it meets the expectations I'd had for it.  Nothing more, nothing less.  The sound effects are basic, themselves, with everything you'd want for sword strikes and magic blasts.  I appreciate that Namco didn't hire voice actors for Dragon Valor.  They probably would have made me squirm. I got a lot more out of Dragon Valor than I thought. When I first started playing, my impressions were vague, yet negative. It starts off in a way that made me think it was going to belly-flop painfully. The more I progressed, the more I got into it.  Its gameplay reminds me of an old Super Nintendo game I used to like, King of Dragons, a linear, arcade-style, side-scrolling action title, only with several noticeable variations.  Namco's gameplay formula follows a 2D style, despite being portrayed in limited 3D levels.  It's a fun game, though a tad short, but it's got the right stuff where it counts. Just don't expect too much.", "date": "Dec 5, 2000"}
