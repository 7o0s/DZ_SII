It's a shame that the developers didn't try to acknowledge any other racing games from the past decade or so since Road Rash came out. Instead this is a fast and dumb racer that can go full throttle, but often spins wildly out of control. Think of a simplified version of Burnout on two wheels. Now take that idea a few notches in quality and that's what you should expect here.   As the name implies, the racing in this game is on the way to the rally, so all of the ~racetracks~ are sections of regular highways all across the country. There are plenty of turns to navigate as well as traffic everywhere. Since you can kick at other racers or simply knock them over by ramming them there are plenty of chances to see some wrecks. The only thing missing is the option to grab a bat from another racer and then beat him down with it.   What Harley-Davidson: Race to the Rally provides is lots of speed. And by speed, I mean lots of speed boosting. The boost meter can be filled with some risky driving. This includes driving against traffic, getting near misses with cars, hitting some sweet jumps, and even just popping a wheelie. This last one is a bizarre choice since popping a wheelie is done simply by holding down the L1 button. On a straightaway it's simple enough to start a wheelie, hit the boost, and keep both going as long as you want since the wheelie keeps replenishing the boost meter. With a couple minutes of practice you can have infinite boost in the entire game.   But if there's a decent idea here, and violent motorcycle racing is a good idea, then it's all about the execution and it's not a pretty thing to behold here. The graphics can be choppy, cars difficult to make out, and if you smash into a car or wall, then the frame rate drops to below 10 fps for a few seconds. There's also this weird quirk that small ramps in the road have the ability to stop you dead in your tracks. It's not a crash, just a real quick stop and it makes no sense.   Logic takes a holiday for videogames, but it's completely left the country for good here. Launching off of a ramp is a little bit of a thrill, but landing it can be a crap shoot. Landings that should have been fine will cause an instant crash upon arrival while some ridiculous positions of the tires will still be kosher. The walls have their own idiosyncrasies when it comes to deciding if you crash or not when you touch them.   If there was one word to describe the tracks it would be ~repetitive.~ If you wanted a few more words you could use, ~cut & paste & paste & paste.~ There is so little variety in the tracks that you feel like the team gave up halfway through. That would help to explain a few tracks that are just straight highways with a handful of turns in them. And that's not straight-ish, they're perfectly linear where the sole challenge is going quickly and not hitting too much traffic. And even that's a no-brainer since there's usually a margin on the side you can wheelie-boost through.Harley-Davidson: Race to the Rally feels like it was designed by folks who didn't really care or didn't really understand what would make a racing game fun, or even competently done. This feels like a quick demo for a game that was never finished and never will be. Seeing the boost effect is cool for a few seconds when you think you're going to be playing some fast and crazy racer, but really it's just fast. Fast and dumb and not worthy of your time.", "date": "Dec 11, 2006"}
