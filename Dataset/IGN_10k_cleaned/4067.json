Each has been a truly quality product, mirroring as much of the excellent console versions as technically possible on the handheld system. But after we've all experienced the game in three different times in separate iterations, it's clear that the designers would have to really do something special to the series to make the game worth a fourth time around. And that's exactly what they have done for Tony Hawk's Underground. While the basics of this sequel are relatively untouched from the tried-and-true Tony Hawk gameplay, the GBA team rethought the desingn structure and level layout for the sequel, and with that move comes a game that feels both familiar and entirely new. The way the team constructed specific gameplay elements opens up the game design in an entirely different direction, breathing fresh life into one of the best action designs of the past half decade. Features Ten different skate parks Seventeen different pro skaters Career and Arcade modes Create-a-Skater and Create-a-Board editors Multiplayer (hot seat one system) Link cable support (multiple cartridge) Cartridge save (three slots)  The Game Boy Advance version of Tony Hawk's Underground, like the previous games in the Tony Hawk series on the handheld, is entirely based upon the console design of the same name. The GBA series has evolved with the Neversoft creation, as much as it technically can be with all of the limitations of the handheld hardware. The system honestly cannot handle the same ~you are there~ 3D game design and level construction the series has enjoyed, even since the days of the first game on the Sony PlayStation original. But the developers of the Game Boy Advance version, Vicarious Visions, have plugged along with its hybrid engine of modeling the levels in a scrolling bitmap, but rendering the character as a 3D object with texture-mapped polygons. The result is, and has always been, a game that feels like Tony Hawk on the go. And that's an incredible thing.  On the surface, the game hasn't changed much from its isometric gameplay roots of the past Game Boy Advance games in the series. It's still about pulling off tricks by grinding ledges and leaping in the air off quarter and half-pipes, funboxes, rails...all within real-world situations and locations. Players will have the freedom to skate around and perform duties given to them by the in-game characters, trying to pull them off before their specific time runs out. Challenges haven't changed much from past Tony Hawk games, not straying far from the original ~Collect 'S-K-A-T-E' or 'C-O-M-B-O' letters~ tasks...but there are much more of them of increasing difficulty the further into the game you go. There are ten different skateparks in Tony Hawk's Underground, as well. But even though this all sounds like the same old Tony Hawk it's the way it's been structured that makes Tony Hawk's Underground a completely new experience.    This time around, players don't start off as a god-like thrasher. You can't just jump into the roll of a professional skater...you have to earn that namesake by getting out of the house and pulling your weight. Tricks and techniques aren't second nature, either; right out of the gate players can only do the basic grab, flip and grind tricks, but by pulling off a sequence of these the character's attributes will increase. The higher the skill level, the more the player can do, and the better he can do them. The addition of the character stats gives players another set of challenges to shoot for beyond the standard in-level tasks; they can see exactly what's required to build up a statistic by pulling up an easy-to-read menu. And players can easily see when a statistic point has been earned...but like the points structure in Tony Hawk, if statistic points are earned during a combination string, they're lost if the player happens to fall on his face and fail to complete that combo. There will be times when players will not be able to advance without reaching a specific statistics level, so players will have to practice on the side in order to advance to the next task on the checklist.  The levels in Tony Hawk's Underground are absolutely massive and well-designed with tons of ramps and rails to ride, but at the start of the round sections of these areas will be restricted; in these locked-out locations, skating is a no-no. Enter a new ability: hop off the board and walk. If you happen to find yourself in a No Skating Zone (the screen flashes an obvious red), you have a few short seconds to leap off your board and start running...otherwise you'll be inconveniently kicked out, and sent back to the start of the level. The boardless run ability isn't an incredible feature by itself...it's actually a silly little move that doesn't really fit the Tony Hawk gameplay. But the developers have incorporated it into a skating move...a trick to link other board tricks together. This is called the ~run out,~ and like Tony Hawk 4's ~spine transfer~ and Tony Hawk 3's ~revert,~ the ~run out~ is this generation's addition to the trick system. Players have the ability to leap out of a manual into a run-out, and then must get back on the board into another manual in order to keep the combo going.    But these No Skating Zone areas are only temporary, and as players complete character tasks, the storyline continues and they'll give players access to these locked out areas. By the time all the tasks are complete, the entire park is skateable and it's on to the next park. Many of the different locations of the Game Boy Advance version of Tony Hawk's Underground are based upon the locations created for the console game. But even though there may be a couple parks missing in the conversion, the team went a little further by bringing back two classic levels from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2: the Warehouse and the Hangar. They've been slightly altered in the move from Tony Hawk 2 to THUG (the hangar is missing the helicopter and plane, for example), but it's great to thrash around in these levels again, since they're the most memorable ones from the previous games in the series.  The main career mode will literally take players several hours to get into the professional level, and this length of gameplay is well worth the price of THUG's admission...even if you've played through previous GBA iterations of the Tony Hawk series. But no...there's more. Much more. Each of the ten different levels in THUG not only has its own series of tasks for players in the Career Mode, but -- get this -- they also have another series of challenges in Arcade Mode as well. The GBA team went old-school with THUG, bringing back the Arcade Mode from Tony Hawk 2 and Tony Hawk 3 as a separate mode in the brand new game...right down to the Sick Scores and the Hidden Tapes. The encouragement here: each of the professionals holds a special cheat...and the only way to unlock that cheat is to complete Arcade Mode in all levels with that professional. Even though the free-skating Career Mode is what made Tony Hawk 4 better than the past games in the series, the inclusion of the Arcade Mode as a separate entity is still incredibly welcome and adds a ton more replay to the game design. It's also very portable friendly, since players can easily whip out their systems for a couple two-minute Arcade Mode sessions, save the progress and put it right back in their pockets for later.  Vicarious Vision's engine continues to evolve in each iteration of Tony Hawk on the Game Boy Advance, and THUG is no exception...though a lot of the graphical improvements are so subtle they honestly wouldn't be missed if they weren't there. For example: Tony Hawk's Underground features an in-game 24-hour clock, where a second is essentially a minute of game time. As players skate around, the background graphics gradually change in relation to what time it is; so, at nighttime the area might look a little bluer than during the morning or noontime. Another minor addition: players can customize their game with the board editor, a basic paint program where they can draw up their own texture creation for the bottom of their deck. It's great that this feature's in there, but it's only good for the main menu; during the game, the texture's reduced to an unrecognizable blob that's only apparent when players are facing away from the camera...in mid-air.  But the team has obviously pushed the engine further than it was meant to go, since there are a few instances where the game will slow down. It's especially apparent when you get really good and fill up the lower half of the screen with text during a particularly skillful combo string. The on-screen text will apparently bog down the processing power, and the game will start to slooooooooow dooooooooown. It doesn't happen a whole lot, but it does happen...and it's unfortunate that it does because that is, honestly, the only bad notch in this fantastic Tony Hawk sequel.  I honestly did not expect to have nearly as much fun with THUG as I ended up having. I thought the series had run out of steam after Tony Hawk 4, but man...I was wrong. The GBA team injected a whole new energy into the game design with its new level structures and new challenges, as well as some seriously well-designed skateparks with plenty of gaps to discover. I don't know if it's possible to keep the series going like this for Tony Hawk 6 without another redesign, but until that game's announced, THUG on the GBA will keep players busy.
