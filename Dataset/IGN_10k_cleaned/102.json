Despite its short length, the age of the wooden fighting ship remains a powerful image in the modern mind. From the swashbuckling movies of the 30s to the recent novels of Patrick O'Brien, these ships and their crews possess a mystique and charm that is unequaled. And with good reason. The 18th century ship-of-the-line was the most devastating killing machine of its day. And as the pinnacle of European craftsmanship, it was supremely beautiful--if a killing machine can ever truly be beautiful...which it can.  So what are the strengths of the game? Quite a few actually. For one thing, it puts you right on the deck of your ship. You can run anywhere on the deck and look in any direction. Although it would be nice to be able to look up or down as well, I never really lost the ~I am there~ experience hyped up in the manual. A lot of naval war games have gone 3D and 1P, but MoW2 takes the trouble to put you directly into the captain's boots. That brings a huge level of involvement and intensity to the game that tough to beat. You also get a handy spyglass that you can use to examine the other ships in the area.  Another strength of the game is the incredibly easy interface. Since it's a RTS game, you've got to have a simple interface or you're sunk...literally. You control the navigation, cannons, crew and sails all from the deck. You select which of four types of shot to use in your cannons, line them up on the target and fire them at the hated French. The crew can be set on four priorities--man the pumps (repair), work the guns or the sails or gather on the deck in preparation for a boarding attempt. There are three sail states to choose from and you can even back the sails to position your ship just right. All in all, the command interface is very clean and simple but still offers a high level of control.  Now for the bad news. The game looks pretty mediocre. Those of you who are used to slick 3D graphics will definitely be disappointed with this one. The ships look pretty good in the middle distances, but once you get up close, they really look crappy. The deck of your own ship looks okay but in today's market, I think gamers expect a little more. Weapon effects are also a little flat. The environments look good though. The sea and the sky are much improved over MoW1. Although the screenshots on the box feature variable times of day, all of my missions seemed to take place in broad daylight. Too bad. Some of those night battles looked very cool.  The second biggest problem in this game is the boarding interface. When I boarded my first cruiser, I was hoping to see some serious 18th century style violence. Instead of sailors swinging cutlasses or firing from the tops, all you get are a couple of strength bars and an advance or retreat button. All the excitement of hand to hand fighting from ship to ship was reduced to watching a few little red bars shrink down to nothing. I don't even mind the lack of a tactical element to the boarding process. My big complaint is that it just looks so damn boring.  You can play at three levels of command--captain, division commander or fleet commander. As an individual captain, you are only responsible for following the orders given to you by your superiors. Fleet commanders must take on the responsibility of directing the battle as a whole. Division commanders fall somewhere in the middle, being responsible for their individual group of ships and yet still accountable to the Fleet commander. The order interface is pretty basic but there are enough order options that you can get the ships to do pretty much whatever you want. All levels of command can delegate command of the ship to your 2IC (that's second-in-command for you landhogs), allowing you to focus more on the big picture.  You can play in either of two campaigns--The Wooden Walls of England, where you fight as the British in the Anglo-French wars in the Channel, or John Paul Jones, where you take on the role of the hero of the fledgling American navy. I wish that the campaigns could've been played from either side, but the campaign system is pretty well developed as it is. The Wooden Walls of England campaign plays differently depending on the rank you choose at the beginning.  MoW2 also comes with 20 stand-alone scenarios--from Byng's failure at Minorca to Nelson's victory at Trafalgar. The scenarios are a nice mix of small and large engagements. The Trafalgar scenario is quite impressive and well designed. Everywhere you look you can see ships. If playing as Nelson, you'll soon find the biggest challenge is playing traffic cop for your own ships. The addition of a scenario generator (or, even better, an editor) would go a long way to making this game better.  I wish I could say something about the multiplayer game, but I never found anyone to play with...will you be my friend? On the plus side, MoW2 comes with an internal multiplayer interface and that scores big points in my book. No signing up for other services here.  Normally I'm a nut for this kind of game. My copy of Wooden Ships and Iron Men even has that well-worn, played-a-lot look but MoW2: Chains of Command doesn't live up to my expectations. It does recreate the world of wooden ships, but I was never fooled into thinking that the world of the game really existed. It is a decent game, but there are so many areas in which it fails to deliver. In terms of concept, it's great, but in terms of execution, the technology just isn't there to support it.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Aug 17, 1999"}
