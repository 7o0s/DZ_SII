The transition has been well documented by the press and so I won't belabor the point, but it's interesting to take a look at Star Wars Racer Revenge in light of Star Wars arcade games. We all remember the first Star Wars arcade game, and sentimentalize it quite a bit (rightfully so). And though it was followed by that weird hybrid shooter-racer-light-saber Sega coin-op, Star Wars Pod Racer was better than decent, while its console cousin left much to be desired. LucasArts hasn't tarnished its arcade image terribly, and with Star Wars Racer Revenge, which by the way would have made a great arcade title, the an engaging, bruising, and surprisingly apt racer upholds the Lucas racing reputation with bravado.   It's no surprise, though, because behind the game's reigns is the seemingly untouchable developer Rainbow Studios. Always breaking down the essentials of every game it takes on, Rainbow has fine-tuned the pods, fleshed out the courses and infused the game with a Road Rash sensibility, adding in bruising pod racer-style fights to the mix. As a racing fan and someone always hoping that LucasArts will live up to its potential on the consoles, I was pleased as punch to play through this racer several times, and the only things that saddens me about this game is that I'm late with my review and I have to move onto another game to one.   Presentation When I first played Star Wars Episode I: Racer, before the movie hit theaters, I played it and walked away non-plussed. It was a racer, easily lost among a horde of other racers, only this one mimicked pod-racing and had the Star Wars license on it. But it was as boring as watching sap emerge from a tree. After I saw the movie I rushed back to play it because I was all excited about it perhaps being a good game that I had overlooked. And after a mere two races I dropped the controller and walked away, feeling totally suckered in by the hype. The game still sucked. I wanted to the play the game because I saw the movie. What a sucker! So naturally, it was nice to see that Rainbow had been hired to re-ignite the pod racing flames, and even though the game looked ass-y back at E3 last year, it was early. And it was Rainbow.   So now that I am drunk with Racer Revenge I have to share the love. One of the first things to notice about its front-end is how entertaining it is. You can select Single Play, Vs., or Tournament, and throughout the game's menus the shiny menus are decorated by the characters themselves. Scroll to a character (there are nine from which to pick initially) and he or she will walk onto the screen in full polygonal form. Then they start goofing. The scratch themselves, look around, and perform all sorts of kooky animations. They are so good-looking and so fun to watch that it's worth just toggling through the menu to see each one do its stuff.   After a course is selected, the camera pans across the course using a good selection of angles, showing off hard turns, major pitfalls, and dangerous locations. The narrator describes the locations in hilarious detail as well, and once he's done, the cutscene displays the starting arena from a sky-cam, including a nicely animated crowd, followed by a panning camera showing all of the racers lined-up and ready to go. After each race, players can check their time against the record holders in lap time, overall time and knockouts. With the exception of the slightly extended load times, the presentation offers a superb take on the rag-tag Star Wars' pilots and makes the once dull idea of pod racing exciting, funny, and likeable. Strange how excellent presentation can change the way you see a game.   Gameplay Moving at a high framerate and plush with exotic locales and raceways, the racing is smooth and responsive in feel and easy to turn, relatively easy to reverse, and overall quick to get into and play without much fuss. And while it's true that Star Wars Racer Revenge brings podracing into the boxing ring, it also incorporates different aspects into the racing mix creating a far more dynamic racer then before. You see, Star Wars Episode I: Racer was a straight-forward arcade racer placed in the Star Wars universe, but Racer Revenge remains arcade-y in nature and is placed in the Star Wars universe but it asks that you look internally -- at your engine's turbo levels and damage meter -- and externally -- at branching paths, shortcuts, and obstacles, and at oncoming opponents -- to succeed.   True to the movie, Racer Revenge requires players to manage their high-powered engines. As players incur damage, their turbine engines naturally take damage. You can repair them during the race, but at a cost. By pressing the L2 button, the racer can repair itself to full strength. A meter on the lower left hand side of the screen displays a color scale showing how much damage is taken, using red as the danger indicator and blue as repair indicator. When engines have regained full strength they appear green. The catch is that racers slow down while being repaired, so a wee bit of timing and strategy are added into the mix.   Meanwhile, there's also a Turbo Boost, but it too must be used with care. See, the turbo boost heats up the twin turbines that thrust your carriage forward, and when they heat up past a point, they explode. Yea! Explosions are good, but not when you're hurting yourself. And when the meter, placed in the bottom right hand side of the corner, reaches max levels, the energy also is quickly drained from your remaining energy, stored in the left hand-side of the screen.   For those who played and liked the Star Wars Episode I: Racer, Racer Revenge enhances the ancient art of bashing to new lows. This one is truer to the ~sport~ of podracing because it encourages foul play as not only a strategy but rewards players with financial means. Yep, Watto, the parts shop dealer and all-around bet-monger, appears before each race with a wager. He needs parts for the shop, and blown apart vehicles are just the ticket to increase his bottom line. Drivers are highly encouraged to bash their opponents to smithereens, and each time another one drops out, Watto hands out a higher percentage of cash. Nail one opponent, receive 10% of what you earned in the race. Nail two guys, 20%, three guys, 30%, and so on and so on.   Earning cash is crucial to staying above the other racers for one major reason. With cash, or Truguts, as they're called, players build up their pods. By visiting the Garage, players buy needed parts from Watto's junkyard/garage and upgrade their vehicles. Points can be attributed to acceleration, to speed, handling, defense, repair, and cooling. By customizing vehicles, players build the kind of racing machine they want and different kinds of strategies will ensue based on these decisions. Want a fast racer with top handling and top speed, but one that's light in cooling and slow on repair? Or how about a bruiser, complete with quick cooling, repair and defense? Personally, I upgraded everything and then specialized in acceleration, top speed, and repair. That way, I could bust past enemies late in the game after having knocked off as many as possible and was still able to repair without losing too much ground.   Some interesting miscellaneous details are worth noting. Star Wars Racer features an in-game map, indicating other racers and the track ahead with topographical-like marks. It shows energy bars above the opponents' heads, offering their health and repair levels as well. Players can use the default controls, L3 to steer, X to accelerate and Square to brake, or they can switch to the arcade controls, enabling players to steer, accelerate and brake using both L3 and R3, the dual shocks, which is excellent fun.   There are 13 initial courses across a dozen or so planets, including the favorite Boonta Eve Classic on Tatooine; nine initial racers (18 altogether to unlock); four perspectives, and the ability to change laps and event types (including practice and Time Trial). The tracks include The Mos Espa Open, Soro Suub Facility, Orotoru G'am, Watchtower Run, The Brightlands, The Badlands, The Ballast Complex, Ruins of Carnuss Gorgull, Serres Sarrano, The Grand Reefs, The Citadel, The Nightlands, and Boonta Eve Classic. The character roster stars Anakin Skywalker, Occo Ninebar, Shrivel Braittrand, Aldar Beedo, Ben Quadinardos, Dud Bolt, Ody Mendrell, Teemto Pagales, Clegg Holdfast, Gasgano, Mawhonic, Knire Dark, Kraid Nemmeso, Wan Sandage, Mars Guo, Scorch Zanales, Tzidick Wrantojo, and your nemesis, Sebulba.   The thing about Racer Revenge is that it's balanced. When I first played though the courses I tried hard to race pure; you know, to just finish with a clean race, no bashing, no fighting. I did that, and it was mildly fun, but I noticed the opponents taking unfair shots at me more often that I liked.  So, after about five races, I changed my strategy -- from pure to dirty. I started out clanging other racers as hard as possible, getting in as many hits as possible in the first lap or two, regenerating my engines in between smashes. After nailing two or three racers, I would then concentrate on racing, and usually, not always mind you, I could catch up and place within the top three racers. (My first time through I earned gold in all but two tracks.)   What's excellent about Racer Revenge, however, is that managing the various aspects, the different meters, bashing into other opponents, and vehicle management all came together. Managing the vehicle is a piece of cake, and only after a race or perhaps two, will it become second nature to manage them. Also, the game isn't that hard, which means that split forks in the road that stop you on a dime and seemingly unfair bashes from opponents may cause damage or ruin your track record, you can always catch up and usually win. I beat the game with Anakin Skywalker in about two hours, which is damn quick. But the point is, you're encouraged and at least I was addicted enough to quickly select another character to race through again. The second and third times through are the most fun, too, because the courses are more familiar and the bashing becomes an art and a highly regarded skill. It's also a kick-butt two-player game, too, that comes highly recommended.   Star Wars Racer Revenge is squarely in the arcade camp of racing, and it's easily the best Star Wars Racing game I have ever played. I'm 100% convinced, and here's my standard personal test. I started playing the game at around 10:15 pm a few nights ago, and when I had finished the entire game (around 12:15 pm), I replayed a few levels in which I won only bronze to upgrade to gold, and then started another Career with another player. That was around 12:30 am in the morning. I then played until 3 am, sleep (and the following day's consequences) be damned. When I willfully stay up that late for a potentially questionable game, it's a good game.   Graphics From the presentation to the menus, the graphics are good and solid, with some highlights and some weak points, too. As I mentioned in the presentation area, the menus are bitchin'. The polygonal, highly detailed characters that walk on screen are beautiful. Every creature is elegantly created, with known characters such as Sebulba and Ben Quadinaros looking superb, and lesser known creatures including Aldar Beedo, Tzidik Wrantojo, and Scorch Zanales appearing exquisite.   As for the in-game graphics, the most eye-catching aspects are the crafts and the backgrounds. From the in-cockpit view, the turbine-reigned chariots show off a high poly count and are re-created with impressive levels of detail. By choosing the close, over-the-shoulder perspective, you can see the whole ship in amazing detail, and while driving it's brilliant to watch the turbines bounce independently, reacting to other craft, smashing into objects, and just generally moving. The other fine details are just as impressive. When a craft, such as Anakin's, turns, flaps on the sides fold out to initiate them. Using the excellent light and particle effects of the PS2, the energy charges between the turbines and the exhaust from the rear of the turbines also look pretty.   The levels themselves are great to ogle, and each is creatively designed. Usually with branching paths, I often find myself hating how the designers create dead-stop areas between the splitting courses, instead of creating a V-shape, which doesn't punish you as much. But these courses were designed well and coupled with the ability to quickly catch up, they aren't as devastating. The courses are lush, vibrant, and with the exception of two forest-style courses, they look entirely different from one another. But the level of detail is there, the color schemes are mixed with bright and dark shades, and in numerous cases, the levels look just short of brilliant. For instance, in the Soro Suub Facility, the transparent tube section is gorgeous to look at. The same goes for the several other areas. Overall the game is very pretty.   The only aspects that hurt the graphics, methinks, are when the framerate takes a hit and the sense of speed is slowed. Also, the cutscenes look like they're pushing far too much stuff, or something, because they're slow and chuggy. There are some, but very few, fade-in areas, along with a little fogging here and there, but nothing to complain about. The load times before a level is the only other hurtful area; but you get a beautiful set of levels, replete with tons of detail.  Sound For starters, the music is classic Star Wars stuff, and every song in it sounds like some re-creation of one Star Wars movie or another. So you will get Star Wars music, and if that's a good thing for you, then hey, you'll like it. For me, I like John Williams' scores, and so using his dramatic music here worked just fine.   The voices are also classic Star Wars. Every character has his set of alien language curses, hurrahs and screams of death. The characters voices don't sound like the actual movie voices, but they're darn close, if they're not genuine. And when it comes to hearing these guys sound off, it's a little weird. You pass some freaky creature and he yells something, but it's impossible to know what they hell he said. I'm sure it's, ~you f*cking bastrd, I'll get you!~ But who the hell knows? So the voices are a little obscure, but that's vintage Star Wars, right? The announcer is there, calling the shots, too. Sometimes he's good, oftentimes he's weak, and overall you have to have him in there. But it didn't sound like the two-headed announcer from Episode I, so that was a little disappointing.   The sound effects are great, mostly. These engine sounds are close enough in most cases to the real movie engine sounds. They're not exact, and oftentimes the engine sounds are actually weak (not as sharp, not as loud, not as accurate), but each craft has its own set of sounds, and the stuttering, acceleration and other sounds do the trick.   My biggest problem with the sound is that at some point in about one-third of the tracks the music and the announcer simply drop out. I'll be cruising along passing guys or whatnot, and all I can hear is my vehicle's sounds; nothing else. Either I'm simply alone and there is no sound, or the sound effects are buggy, and it drops out. Perhaps it's the soundtrack taking a long time to loop, I couldn't tell, but it doesn't seem right. I like Racer Revenge. It's not because of Rainbow Studios itself, although I do genuine find that every game Rainbow makes I like, but it's because the game as a whole package is well rounded, deep with characters, and overall ignited a love for it at 3 am in the morning when I beat it. That sounds wrong... oh well. It's a far superior game, in my opinion, than Star Wars Episode I: Racer, and it's well worth your well earned money. As an arcade game, it's a little easy to beat once, but the point is, you're supposed to play it numerous times. And there are also lots of rewards to unlock, including characters and artwork. If you're a Star Wars fan, well, it's time to rejoice, because this game is handled with class and fine detail. If you're a racing purist, then rent this first because while it's well balanced and in filled with bashing, that may not be your bag. It's arcade-y and fun, and very Star Wars-y.", "date": "Feb 22, 2002"}
