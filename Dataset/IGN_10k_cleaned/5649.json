I think you can still make an entertaining shooter without high production values, however, but you're fighting an uphill battle. Serious Sam did it by throwing waves of imaginative enemies and fun weapon at the player. Unfortunately, that same spark of imagination and style doesn't consistently break through in PsychoToxic. In the end, it feels like an awkward amalgam other, better shooters. I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt when I previewed it earlier, hoping it would gel in the end, but it just didn't.   To recap, you play Angela Prophet, who's been tagged to save the world from an Armageddon brought about by what appears to be a relative of Aleister Crowley. Everything's already starting to go to hell by the time you get involved, and PsychoToxic manages to capture the unsettling end-of-the-world feel of movies like 28 Days Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake--not that the theme in this game is zombies, though. There are monsters and some spooky people running around, but zombies don't make up the majority of it.   Anyhoo, Angie Prophet has some special powers allowing her to pick up power ups to do things like temporarily turn invisible, recharge her health, throw up an invulnerability shield, and a couple other things. Integrating power-ups is about the most interesting element of gameplay, since everything else is run-of-the-mill gun fights, and the power ups were generally well-spaced throughout the levels, coming in handy during key moments.   Still, there's nothing about the game that manages to cross the threshold of FPS mediocrity. The visuals are dated, the sound is middling at best, animation is stiff, and the AI is rudimentary. It's more a shooting gallery than anything else, particularly when Angie is equipped with a scoped weapon. There's one section in a park full of bloodthirsty police and heavily-armed thugs (who seem to have no problem co-existing), where you can pretty much mow them down without breaking a sweat, thanks to the incredible stopping power and accuracy of one assault rifle you'll come across.   The only thing that will keep you on your toes is how incredibly fast an enemy will draw a bead on you when you begin firing from medium to close range. Me, if I was in their shoes, the first thing I would do is flinch, then hit the ground while I tried to figure out where the shots were coming from. On the other hand, their shoot-from-the-hip rabidness is about the only thing that keeps things mildly interesting. And PsychoToxic commits what should be a crime by now--being able to kill someone by shooting an exposed foot or elbow. And then there's the enemies standing and shooting, or running at you guns blazing. And there's the artificially blocked paths that keep you in one straight line from start to finish--except for that park, which is so wide open that it takes forever to find the guy you need to talk to. Lastly, I'm starting to get tired of action games where everyone I encounter wants to kill me.     The airport is a particularly heinous example of railing the player along. In most of the sections of the map, you can hear the streets outside, when everything is going to hell, and it's unsettling, but not nearly as effective as actually seeing a little of what's going on. Let me tell you: When I see a door, and I have a gun, I should be able to blow my way through it, or perhaps brute force rush it. After playing some SWAT 4 co-op for the last couple days, I've come to appreciate how silly it is to have invincible doors and windows all over the place. I'm not looking for a Red Faction level of destructibility, but at least indulge me with a little more immersiveness, even if the room beyond is devoid of enemies or loot.   Meanwhile, the dream sequences, where Angie is removed from the mundane real world, are surprisingly solid. If there were more of these, or if the whole game had been based in this environment, who knows where things could have gone. With no constraints on environmental realism, it almost feels like a different game, and each sequence is quite different. You'll wander through cartoon environments, hellish nightmare catwalks, and a Gothic town viewed through a flickering sienna filter, just to name a few.So why doesn't this boost PsychoToxic's score that much higher? Because there are bugs and instability, and interesting environments can't overcome bland gameplay, weak AI, and lack of polish. It might have been a good game if it had come out in the mid-90s against Rise of the Triad or CyberMage, but we've come to expect more, and even consoles are getting in on the FPS action. So when PsychoToxic doesn't have the guilty pleasures of NARC, the shininess of Painkiller, the fluid design of Halo, the gory indulgence of BloodRayne, or the babe factor of Tomb Raider, it actually ends up being less than the sum of its parts. This game might have fared better in a third-person perspective, so that there at least would have been something nice to distract oneself from the middling gameplay. Instead, this is one of those games I would have put down after less than ten minutes if I hadn't had to review it.", "date": "Mar 30, 2005"}
