{"name": "RoadKill", "name_review": "Roadkill Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/15/roadkill-review", "text": "The double-barrel's been cocked, the guests are milling around in an alcoholic haze, and the wedding party looks like something out of The Omega Man. Papa's finger is growing sweaty on the trigger, and the bridegroom looks like he's going to puke or run. Got a picture? Good. It's analogy time.   Put simply, Midway's Roadkill is the result of a shotgun wedding between Twisted Metal Black and the next-gen Grand Theft Auto series. While no one keeps stats on actual shotgun weddings, the prospect that these unions are happy and healthy seems unlikely at best. But Roadkill is the exception to the rule. It may not be the world's prettiest baby, but this kid can definitely kick your honor student's ass.   You hear a lot of gaming journalists bellyaching about games being unoriginal, uninspired and carbon copies of each other. We do it. They do it. Dogs do it. Much of this criticism is justified, as there's a lot of vile, unplayable gunk out there that's designed to cash in on a trend. Make no mistake, Roadkill is also trying to cash in, but instead of simply trying to mimic one game, it strives to be a blend of two, and even manages to carve out its own identity.    That Midway succeeded is to be commended. It's just as difficult sometimes to take an existing formula and make it ring true. Roadkill survives and flourishes by pillaging, and only fails in some of the details. The graphics can use help, the cut scenes are fairly useless, and the car physics might put some fans off. But if you can get over your bad self, this game can be quite enjoyable, even wickedly fun.   Gameplay   Set in a post-apocalyptic world where gangs roam free, killing and looting the decaying cities of the charred Earth, Roadkill is an enveloping experience. The cities game spans are large and mostly interactive, and densely populated with scum and vermin. All of the people in the game can be run over, shot and dragged under your car, creating huge streams and trails of blood (remember, this is the company that brought the world Mortal Kombat). Nearly every vehicle in the game is yoked with guns, and every driver has serious road rage. Even the pedestrians have taken to arming themselves, making driving around town quite an adventure. And since there are three massive GTA-scale worlds to eventually explore, there is a lot of adventure to be had, indeed.    The texture of the single player game is grittier than a glass full of dry Metamucil. Some of it is forced (the cut scenes) and some of it is not (the wide-open, blood-spilling orgy of car violence around every corner). The story is one of brutality, crime, death and revenge, and most of it revolves around your rise to power as you gain the reputation of ultimate post-apocalyptic badass. As you progress and complete more tasks, you are given different and sometimes humorous titles to reflect your rep. Early on, for instance, you actually achieve the rank of ~Ass Clown.~   The tale is mainly told through standard cut scenes, although some of the action is explained over the radio as well, using news flashes that cut into the actual programming. Ultimately, the story is not the reason to pick this game up. The cut scenes are over-the-top, uber-violent and, in the end, not all that original.   But, as we said, you won't be playing this to watch movies. You'll be playing it to drive around, kill everything, and create post-apocalyptic havoc. The single player experience is mission-based, but there's a lot of extra stuff to do along the way. The missions themselves are as varied as possible for a game where you never get out of the car. There are races, seek and destroy missions, assassination objectives, collection missions, and more. The team did a good job of mixing up the madness so gameplay doesn't get stale. Just when you're growing tired of the same type of mission, they throw an objective in that has you manning the mounted gun at the back of your ride, or dragging a still-living rival around on the bumper of your car.   Missions can be quite difficult as well, but this is balanced with the ability to upgrade your vehicle. By destroying other gangs' rides in a hardscrabble, all-out street war, you can earn salvage, which can in turn be used to purchase more armor, speed and other upgrades. You can also drive around the city and collect Parts and Blueprints to put various weapons and vehicles together. Of course, most of these Parts can only be found by completing crazy jumps and death-defying stunts. What's cool about this kind of upgrade system is that it fulfills the need to collect, while forcing you to fully explore the huge cities, and master the vehicle acrobatics.   Speaking of the vehicles, the physics at play here are not quite what you'd expect. They're not really based in reality, but that's not really the point. The vehicle physics actually work for this game. To people who have played a lot of car combat games, the vehicles might feel a little light or floaty, and possibly a little over-responsive. But in order to allow vehicles to get to some of the precarious perches in the game, some of the rules had to be bent. For one thing, you can steer while in the air. You can also brake while airborne, allowing your vehicle to drop down safely while sailing over buildings and other vehicles. If you're very particular about vehicle control, rent the game first, as the physics could be a deal breaker. But if you're willing to give this particular scheme a shot, you'll find that it's tailor-made to the particular brand of action.    There are tons of vehicles to choose from, but they're not really all that distinct from one another. Their differences become a little more obvious when playing multiplayer, but even then, the standard design is the same: front-mounted gun, rear-mounted turret gun (which is occupied by a constant gunner). Using all of the vehicles feels roughly the same as well, which is due mainly to the arcadey control. Diversity issues aside, it's fun to collect as many cars as possible for your garage (the starting and saving point whenever you die).    The car combat action never gets old, and there's always a battle to be had in the open streets. There are also several special-type combat situations that can be experienced by driving over icons, much like GTA. The best of these is Survival, which cranks the RIOT meter (kind of like the Wanted Level) to full and unleashes all of the city's baddies on you at once. Racking up huge times in Survival is perhaps the most fulfilling part of the game and the most mindless.   If ever you tire of the single player experience, there is also a well-made multiplayer game attached. It's not as nuanced and deep as Twisted Metal: Black in terms of multiplayer, but it will keep you and three friends busy for many an afternoon. There are plenty of maps and vehicles to use, even though some key features are missing.    For instance, the only game option is deathmatch, and it requires that you play to a certain number of kills. A timed match would have been a good option, and the ability to place bots in a two-player game should have been included. As it stands, games between two players are fairly pointless. Still, the fact that the multiplayer is functional and enjoyable adds immensely to the replay value of the title.   Graphics  There are subtle things about the graphics that are impressive. The camera is good at following the action around and through structures, the frame rate is pretty solid, and the environments are huge and detailed. These accomplishments should not be overlooked.   However, the overall look of the game is rather bland. In attempting to make everything look gritty, the textures end up looking muddy instead. Especially on the multiplayer, where the screen is split into four zones, things can be tough to see as a result. The multiplayer maps are also excessively dark on the default setting.   The vehicle designs are somewhat interesting, but since each has approximately the same weapons loadout, they all look similar. As for the character models, they are usually too small on the screen to be much of a factor, but in the cut scenes, they seem rather derivative. The main character looks a lot like Tommy Vercetti, and some of the goons bite Sweet Tooth pretty hard.   Ultimately, this game could have benefited from a more stylized look. As it is, it exists in a twilight realm of muted colors, washed-out textures and stereotypical characters. It's not that the graphics are bad, per se, it's that they just don't set themselves apart.   Sound  There's no doubt that the prize squash of the sound department's county fair is the wide array of radio content. While the idea has been ripped straight from the soundwaves of GTA III and Vice City, that doesn't make it unwelcome. Like GTA, the radio features hours of content, both music and talk radio. The DJs on the radio's call-in car talk show are the most ribald, and at times most offensive, video game characters we've run across.     The talk radio can get pretty rough (Howard Stern might blush), and much of it is wickedly funny, but some gamers may take exception to the rampant stereotypes portrayed over the airwaves. Gays are constantly lampooned, and the depiction of women is substandard at best. Most of it is played for shock value, but that doesn't make it okay.   Luckily, the game has pockets of great music--everything from Blue Oyster Cult's ~Don't Fear the Reaper~ to Rick Springfield's ~Jessie's Girl.~ The only problem is that straight music is sometimes hard to find on a radio that's clogged with talking (kind of like the real radio, huh?). Here is a list of the licensed songs:      ~Jessie's Girl~: Rick Springfield   ~(Don't Fear) The Reaper~: Blue Oyster Cult   ~Burnin' For You~: Blue Oyster Cult   ~Slow Ride~: Foghat   ~When I Need You~: Leo Sayer   ~Heading Out To The Highway~: Judas Priest   ~Hot Blooded~: Foreigner   ~Waiting For A Girl Like You~: Foreigner   ~I Like To Rock~: April Wine   ~Sign Of The Gypsy Queen~: April Wine   ~Redline To Your Heart~: King Kobra   ~Street Machine~: King Kobra   ~You've Got Another Thing Comin~: Judas Priest     The music also consists of several butt rock tracks by a made-up band called the Fuzz Brothers. They stand up well next to the rest of the music, which is perhaps the best compliment of all.   The in-game sound effects are a mixed bag. While the plink-plink of horizontal lead rain is nice, the motor noises lack variation. The explosions sound decent, and there's nothing quite like the sound of a rocket swishing past your head.   The voice acting could also use a lot of help. We've already mentioned that many of the cut scenes are sub-par, and the vocal work does nothing to save them. For one thing, nobody has really made cursing sound right in video games, yet and there is a lot of cursing in this game. The main problem is that there's no subtlety. Everything is gravelly-voiced, bilious rage, and it gets tiresome.If you liked Grand Theft Auto and Twisted Metal, it's pretty likely that you'll enjoy Roadkill. The game is wide-open, the areas are fun to explore, and there are some truly funny moments along the way. One thing to note, though: this game earns all of its M-rating. It's a capital M. There is more gore, rough language, and general disrespect for humanity in this game than in most prisons. If you go in with your eyes open or (God help us) even enjoy some of these things, then it can be bloody good fun. While its story and graphics lack pizzazz, Roadkill has something for everyone: action fans, racing fans, collection freaks, and serial killers can all find fulfillment here.", "date": "Oct 15, 2003"}
