The developer was responsible for some of the C64's greatest hits, like Jumpman, Pitstop, Gateway to Apshai, California Games, and this nostalgic throwback, Winter Games. Launching just in time for the snowy season, Mforma resurrection evokes a lot of good feelings. But it also reminds you just how limited game play really was back in the day.   Winter Games consists of a handful of events: ski jump, speed skating, biathlon, and slalom. The four events handles quite similar to their classic counterparts. In speed skating, you place your fingers on ~4~ and ~6~ and tap them rhythmically as a mark on a meter loves from side to side. Ski jump launches you into the air where you must move in different directions to maintain balance and loft. Slalom is a downhill race through flagged gates. The more flags you miss, the greater the penalty against your final score.   The hardest event of the four is biathlon, a combining of skiing and shooting. You pump the action button to swoosh through the snow and then shoot out targets as the sights move up and down. As you ski, you can't just jam on the action button or you'll raise your pulse too high to get off a decent shot on the shooting range. On the range, you must actually load your gun between each shot by pushing down and up on the thumb pad.   Only having four events makes Winter Games a really brief experience, but at least there are no duds in the bunch. The game is quick, but engaging. And it's also one of those games where practice honestly makes you better. Your first biathlon or slalom runs will end in disappointment. But keep at it. You start to sense the best times to shoot. Yu start to keep an eye on the bottom of the screen for the next flagged gate and avoid over-steering to reach it.   Winter Games includes a ~sotra online~ feature. You can upload your best scores to a networked leaderboard that keeps track of the top point-earners and the country they seleccted.   Developer Venan did a good job recreating the old-school look of Winter Games. They could have attempted an overhaul, but the spartan visuals are a nice wink to the C64 glory days. The game does play a couple jingles during play, but you may be surprised by how loud they are. Dial it back a touch, guys.Face it, you're either a fan of these old Epyx games or you're not. Because I was such a Commodore 64 junkie, I can't help but enjoy the game -- even if it did eliminate the bobsled event. (Blasphemy!) However, it is admittedly a pretty shallow game. If you're a fan of all things wayback -- or really want to put your mittens on a winter-themed game -- Winter Games is a decent download. But if you're looking for something deep, look elsewhere.", "date": "Dec 4, 2004"}
