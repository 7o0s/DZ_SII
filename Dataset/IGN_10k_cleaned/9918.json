Cross-platform releases are supposed to be pretty much identical. That way I can play the games and write one review that can be slightly modified and published on each channel. I already reviewed Taito Legends 2 on the PlayStation 2. I expected the PC version to be the same ~alright~ experience.  I was wrong.  Imagine my surprise when I put this CD-ROM in and found a completely different game. Over on the PlayStation side, I complained about the lack of presentation and goodies, but here we get 3D arcade cabinets and original sales fliers. The game count holds steady at 39, but it's actually a mix of the same stuff as the console version (titles such as Lunar Rescue, a simplistic 1979 spacecraft game that has you avoiding asteroids and aliens while transporting people from the moon to the mother ship, and Puchi Carat, a 1997 game that has you bouncing a ball back and forth Pong-style while destroying colored jewels) to brand new additions (games such as Bubble Symphony, where you capture enemies in bubbles and pop them for points, and ).  Bend it like Mr. Posh Spice. Bravo, Taito.  So, yeah, ,if you haven't picked up on it yet, Taito Legends 2 is a arcade compilation that packs some of the companies biggest hits onto one disc. What all is there? Well, I'm glad you asked    DA GAMES!Alpine SkiArabian MagicBronze AdventureBubble SymphonyCadashCameltryChack'n PopCleopatra FortuneCrazy BalloonDarius GaidenDon Doko DonDungeon MagicElevator Action ReturnsFootball ChampFront LineGekerindanGrid SeekerGrowlGun & FrontierInsector XKi Ki Kai KaiKuri KintonLiquid KidsLunar RescueMetal BlackNastarPop 'N PopPuchi CaratPuzzle Bobble 2QixRaimaisRayforceSpace Invaders '95Space Invaders DXSuper Space Invaders '91The Fairyland StoryThe Legend Of KageViolence FightWild Western  The controls for this collection are tight, responsive and customizable. Don't want to use Z or space to cast magic spells in The Fairyland Story? Feel free to switch your magic to whatever keystroke you like and then fly off on your broom to crush any of those pig/wolf soldiers that try to get in your platforming way.   Although some of the earlier arcade games look like  well  early arcade games, the more recent titles provide solid graphics and engaging gameplay -- as long as you let them display in their original ratio and don't stretch them to fill your screen. Football Champ, a soccer title from 1990, packs seven international teams into a bright and colorful game of slide tackles, fouls and the mandatory team celebrations after each goal. Throw in a two-player co-op/competitive mode and you're set for a night of annoying your friends by screaming ~GOOOOAAAAL!~ over and over.  Football Champs isn't a rarity in Legends 2. Most of the games include a two-player mode whenever applicable so you and your favorite second player can beat the hell out of each other in the one-on-one brawler Violence Fight or team-up to take on evil poachers in the beat'em up Growl. Heck, have you always wanted to go head-to-head with a bud in Liquid Kids and see which of you can eat the most cake and get Hipopo to the finish line the quickest? You're prayers have been answered.  GRRRRRRRRRRRROWL! In my PS2 review of the game, this is the point where I railed on Taito Legends 2 for not having any presentation value, but that obviously isn't the case with the PC version. The inclusion of virtual arcade cabinets, high scores as well as initials at the game selection screen and interview with Toshihiro Nishikado, the former director of development, put this game among the best compilations around if you're jonesing for Taito.  Oh, did I mention it's only $9.99?Thirty-nine games for $9.99 is nothing to scoff at, but the inclusion of a polished presentation including fliers and cabinets should make this one a no-brainier for anyone looking to pick up a solid compilation.", "date": "Jan 29, 2008"}
