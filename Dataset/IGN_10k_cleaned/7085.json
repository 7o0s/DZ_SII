{"name": "Absolute Minesweeper", "name_review": "Absolute Minesweeper", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/07/27/absolute-minesweeper", "text": "Every copy of Windows is shipped with two slight pieces of software that were the absolute bane of corporate productivity prior to the arrival of the internet: solitaire and minesweeper. Digital Chocolate, after surveying the mobile landscape to discover there isn't a decent version of minesweeper anywhere, took it upon themselves to bring the little game to the littlest screen. The result is an attractive title with bright graphics that complement completely competent game play. Absolute Minesweeper in no way, shape, or form advances the ball -- but it's pretty obvious that with a game like minesweeper, there is hardly any need for evolutionary jumps.   This hasn't stopped DChoc from including a 2K6 addition: Absolute mode. This updated game offers power-ups like a time freeze that halts the countdown. The game lets you know when the power-ups are near by illuminating the clues that reveal the number of mines adjacent to the unoccupied square on the game grid. It's an unobtrusive add-on, nice to have as a diversion, but the main draw -- and the mode I preferred to hang with -- is traditional minesweeper. Half of minesweeper's charm is its low bulb puzzle play -- it's mildly engaging on purpose, perfect for spending a few minutes with between filing out numbingly dull spreadsheets.   DChoc also adds the option to play on customized playing fields that offer a little more juice than basic box-like grids. Multiple difficulty settings are also present, so you can ease back into the waters if you've long since abandoned minesweeper for other games -- or use a Mac. As always, DChoc includes Mobile League functionality; in this case, you can upload scores to leader boards.   Absolute Minesweeper features a fresh coat of paint, including four skins to suit various fancies, such as a garden or a lunar landscape. These skins have no effect on game play, but are a nice personalization tool.  Absolute Minesweeper is what it is -- a new edition of the evergreen puzzle game that is installed on over 90-percent of the world's PCs. DChoc adds a remix mode with bonus items, but it's not such an incredible add-on that this becomes an essential download. It's a solid recreation of the oversaturated game, dressed up with above average production values. (What's odd here is how few minesweepers are on mobile -- and this is perhaps why the game is dinging a few points for unoriginality. It fills a void.) If you want an old standby, or a download you can feel ~safe~ about, Absolute Minesweeper is a decent buy. But there are definitely more engaging cellphone games out there that deserve your money and attention. Tower Bloxx, anyone?", "date": "Jul 27, 2006"}
