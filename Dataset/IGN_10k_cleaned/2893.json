Now, even as Nintendo plans to ship Mario Party 4, publisher Namco has thrown its hat into the mix with Pac-Man Fever, an offering which mirrors the play styles and mechanics of the genre and adds its own set of unique mascots including Pac-Man, some new mini-games to boot and an emphasis on multiplayer competition.  What's there is mildly fun in short bursts, but there's nothing fresh or new about this game. Furthermore, it lacks depth, offering a comparatively light number of boards and mini-games, many of which similarly lack the creative flair of the selection in Mario Party.  The Facts  Party-style board 3D board game with turn-based play Three detailed boards to travel through Play as Pac-Man or Ms. Pac-Man, and a small variety of other characters from Namco games More than 30 mini-games available Earn points to buy items and games Four-player multiplayer mode   Gameplay Pac-Man Fever plays exactly like just about every other 3D board game on the market. First players select a Namco mascot from a pint-sized list that includes Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Heihachi, Tiger from Tekken, Astaroth from Soul Calibur and Reiko from Ridge Racer 4 -- all of them super-deformed versions of their real selves. Given the number of Namco characters available, it's disappointing that there aren't more present in this game.  (One also wonders why the title is called Pac-Man Fever when there are clearly other brands involved.) Then it's off to play in one of two modes, Fever or Mini-Game. Fever delivers the meat and potatoes of the adventure, serving up three different boards to play across in single or multiplayer modes. Mini-Games offers just that.  Before we get into the basics of play, a warning: gamers without friends, turn back. Mario Party was just barely qualified as a single-player experience and Pac-Man Fever, lacking much more, is even less so. To try and play this game alone would be the entertainment equivalent of going through several rounds of board Monopoly with one's self. Computer AI or not, it's not fun and therefore there's really no point.  For those blessed with friendships, Pac-Man Fever is still only barely worth a bother. The title seems to have the right formula for success. Just like in Mario Party, gamers must move around the board, landing on squares and competing in different mini-games for move rights, or to inflict misfortune onto competitors, or to gain moneys to advance, and so on. It's possible, for instance, to steal the opposition's money, or to send foes backward five spaces, or to challenge them specifically for their tokens, and all of these deliver a lukewarm sense of accomplishment. It works. But while the formula remains true, it's been done before and far better. Meanwhile, the pace of the game is tediously slow, as characters seem to stroll leisurely across the board, even AI ones. And what's worse is that players must even suffer through AI rolls and mini-games, twiddling their thumbs as the process runs its course. It's boring, not fun, and gamers well versed in finer board videogames will likely find Pac-Man Fever more chore than entertainment.  The mini-game selection, some 30 in all, is a bit more compelling. Gamers must win in the mini-games to advance on the board, with the winner moving the farthest. There are all sorts of minis to play in, including racing bouts, collection competitions, sports contests, shooting rivalries and more. In one mini-game, players must square off to see who can hit a baseball the farthest the most times. In another, gamers must watch the button patterns that an airplane makes in the sky and then repeat them on their controller -- a play on Parappa the Rapper. In still another, competitors must race to see who can throw more darts on a board most accurately. These are all fun enough. Others are less enjoyable. A racing mini in which gamers must collect the most items while skidding through crowded streets is not nearly as entertaining as it might read on virtual paper. Other offerings still might more fittingly be called miniscule games. In one of these tiny additions gamers must do nothing more than smack and squash fruit with a hammer, the point being to smash the most valuable ones. So the selection is a mixed bag, but it's also not nearly as expansive as the selection in, say, Mario Party 4, which serves up more than 50 brand new games.  Graphics The visual side of Pac-Man Fever falls somewhere in the average. Developer Mass Media has done a respectable job of creating the boards, which run in full polygonal 3D; they are colorful, varied with different texture sets, and even boast background geometry. They also happened to be filled with color, from an orange-yellow sunset world to a ghostly blue one. The board squares are well represented and it's easy to read the symbols and understand what they do, which is a must, particularly for younger gamers. Meanwhile, the character models are detailed enough, though awkwardly malformed.  On the other hand, though, the textures aren't of the highest caliber, often more on the blurry side than on the crisp. The character animation is sometimes stiff -- though the idle movements are fluid, walking motions seems as if the mascots have something crammed painfully up their backsides. Finally, it's a board game, not an action-adventure or a first-person shooter with gigantic worlds, so why is the fluidity never above 30 frames and often below it? In our opinion, this is an inexcusable oversight, and one that should have been corrected.  Sound The musical jingles in Pac-Man Fever are nicely produced and sometimes catchy, if repetitive. Gamers who keep the television on and the volume up for too long will still likely hear complaints from those close by as the variation in songs is almost nil. The sound effects, meanwhile, are for the most part very subdued, and this is disappointing. Namco hasn't done a very good job of capitalizing on the ~character~ of its characters, so to speak -- hardly any of them say a word, the result a somewhat stale audio environment. The audio portion of the game won't scare anybody off, but there's nothing special here either. Indeed, the entirety of Pac-Man Fever could be summed up in that sentence.Pac-Man Fever seems to have xeroxed the party game template down to the most miniscule of details. But though it has the formula down, it has failed tocapture the incentive to play and the depth to sustain continued play. It has three boards -- or, I should say, only three. It has 30 mini-games -- or, I should say, only 30 minis. It's got only a handful of characters despite the fact that it could have included dozens more. And the board movement is slow and tedious.The simple truth is that the original Mario Party was a better game and Mario Party 4 is set to demolish Pac-Man Fever in every conceivable way. In a genre that has already been played out to the extreme, Pac-Man Fever brings absolutely nothing new to the table and in fact omits quite a few features and options previously available.Recommended as a rental only to the most hardcore of Pac-Man, Namco, or 3D board game fans.
