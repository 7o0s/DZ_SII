This year we'll see no less than four games by the first pitch of the 1999 season, and the first title up to the plate is Triple Play 2000 from EA Sports.Last year, Triple Play had its fair share of problems  the 3D engine being the most prominent. Let's just say the frame-rate could never keep up with the game's action. And that's being way too kind. There were other problems, including how the computer AI reacted to certain situations  it wasn't truly realistic.With Triple Play 2000, EA Sports hopes to do to baseball what it does with its other, deeper (and more successful) sports series. Right off the bat (okay, okay, we'll cut out the baseball  clichs.), you can really see that EA Sports went the extra mile to put some quality back into its baseball series.The game features all 30 MLB teams and player rosters that have been updated as of January 15, 1999. All 30 stadiums have also been rendered as accurately as possible (minus a few product endorsements). And if you're into statistics and player creation modes, EA Sports has included a deep trade and free agent mode. GraphicsThis year, EA Sports fine-tuned the graphics engine and added all sorts of new features. First on the agenda: get the frame-rate up. Rarely does the animation drop below 30 frames per second, making for very smooth-flowing gameplay.The developers also tweaked the look of the game with lightsourcing for the players  it may not sound like much, but with this inclusion the ballplayers now have realistic depth. They look like solid forms this time around. And just for that added touch, the players now chew gum, smile and frown  you can only see these facial animations from cutscenes and instant replays, but it's great to know that developers are taking advances in 3D graphic design.SoundOnce again, EA Sports comes through with some of the best play-by-play commentary ever heard in a sports game. Jim Hughson and Buck Martinez take to the mic and call the plays as they happen. I've only experienced some awkward slowness during some quick, multi-action plays where the play-by-play will be caught behind a bit. But other than that occasional glitch, you'll appreciate the attention that went into making the commentary as seamless as possible.A lot of effort went into the atmosphere as well  you'll hear a lot of stadium-specific audio from the arena's PA, including quirky ~slide-whistle~ effects when a foul ball sails into the crowd (followed by a PA announcement to watch out for foul balls). And if you're the home team, energetic music is heard whe  key players take to the batter's box. Audio-wise, the game is pretty darn complete.GameplayAgain, a lot of attention went into how the game actually plays. Commands have been simplified to make the game flow more quickly. On defense, you're offered four types of pitches depending on your pitcher's abilities. Once selected, you push the D-pad in the nine directions (including center position) to select the area of the strike-zone you want to throw in. If you use the X button, you'll throw into the strikezone. If you hit the O, you'll throw outside the zone.If you're batting, you have three types of hitting options  bunt, regular swing, and power swing. When you push the D-pad up, you'll hit a fly; center position, a line-drive; down, a grounder. Using the power swing button is risky, since you cannot check-swing with it  it's either all or none (just tapping the normal swing button will issue a check-swing).Fielding is straight-forward. Once the ball is hit, you'll see a series of arrows showing where the closest man is in comparison to the ball.  The shorter the distance between arrows, the closer he is to the ball. On pop flies, you'll see the target on the ground where the ball should land. But because of wind and ball spin, the target will more times than none move as the ball sails through the air. Once the ball is caught, it's just a matter of pushing the D-pad in the direction of the base you want to throw to (right, first base; up, second base; etc.) and hitting the X button.Speaking of ball movement, you can truly see how the ball reacts to Astroturf and grass surfaces  on artificial turf, the ball will bounce higher and faster than it would on real grass. The accurate ball physics are a welcome addition.Computer AI is also very accurate   there hasn't been a situation in the field where I've questioned the decisions of the computer players.My only real problem with the game is the front-end options. With most, if not all, EA Sports games, you can select a team matchup based on the abilities  in other words, there's a whole line-up of team strengths and weaknesses that you can surf through to find a match-up between two teams. In Triple Play 2000, you can't do this. You can't see how the team compares to others unless you go into the Team Statistics option and look at each individual player's rankings. If they kept this feature in the game (it was in Triple Play 99), my score rating would be slightly higher.Oh, and all you dual-console people out there  the Nintendo 64 version is utter crap. Don't think for a second that the PlayStation version is of the same low quality. It's much, much better. The N64 is obviously based on last year's PlayStation version with a handful of 2000 enhancements  the PlayStation game was given the full rework by EA Sports. Leave the cartridge on the shelf and pick up the PlayStation disc. I was skeptical about liking Triple Play 2000 when I received the first previewable build of the game from EA Sports. But once I saw the game in action I knew I was in for a treat. The game looks, plays, and feels great. The problem with the front-end in the team select screen may seem like a minor one, but I know that thousands of people are going to bitch about this omission  myself included. I want to see how my team compares to the other 29, and create a match-up based on the pros and cons of the players in the roster. Bad move on EA Sports for taking this feature out. Still, this is a top-notch baseball game, and should lead the pack this year  but don't discount the other offerings this season from 989 Studios, 3DO and Interplay. It's going to get awfully crowded on the PlayStation diamond this year  but it's a good thing EA Sports came out first.", "date": "Mar 25, 1999"}
