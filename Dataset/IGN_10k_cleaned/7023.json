Personally, I have vague memories of the title -- I remember it more on the Atari 2600 than anything, and judging from some screens of that cartridge-ized version of the game, I'm guessing those experiences weren't exactly positive. Better is the familiar feeling I had playing the game on my Sony Ericsson 710, scaling tall buildings in many bounds, avoiding flowerpots, bird droppings (or are those eggs?), and getting my fingers caught in closing windows. Every once in a while, you'll catch a glimpse of an angry ape that is just un-Kong-ish enough to keep lawsuits at bay. And once you reach the top of one building, a helicopter takes you to the next one, where you start all over again -- avoiding hazards while pressing up.   The game looks pretty much exactly like the original arcade cabinet and even features music and effects that sound sampled from the source material.  I thought about maybe filling some space here with an existential discussion of how we are all, in some sense, Crazy Climbers. But I ultimately thought better of it. Honestly, there just isn't much to say about Crazy Climber. It is what it is. The game is simplistic and can be enjoyed in small doses -- these are typically banner traits in a mobile game. But nostalgia runs only so deep, and the wear-off period with this one is a little short. It's not a bad download if you want a 80s arcade on your cell, but there are better values out there that deserve consideration before this blast from the past.", "date": "Jun 24, 2006"}
