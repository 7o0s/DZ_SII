Quirky little one-shot games, with some simple marriage of two unrelated concepts. There were baseball games with robots replacing the human players, and pinball titles with out-of-this-world aliens playing host. Science fiction themes were popular, and that's also the direction that this game went  asking, invitingly, ~what would it be like to play billiards on the moon?~   Lunar Pool answered the question by offering players a fairly simple simulation of pool, but then providing a variety of differently-shaped tables and adjustable friction physics. Simulating the lessened gravity on the lunar surface, you could choose to turn down the rolling resistance of each billiard ball to nothing at all, causing the multi-colored spheres to endlessly bounce, collide and ricochet until they ultimately landed in a pocket. Alternatively, you could crank up the pull of the force to make things sluggish and each ball slow, increasing the difficulty in the process.   The difficulty of clearing each ball off of each table, that is, which is the goal of the game. There aren't any cue sticks in Lunar Pool. No chalking the end of your cue, and no using a bridge to reach unreachable shots, and no behind-the-back tricky stuff to impress your friends. The game is straightforward and uncomplicated, giving you a cue ball, cursor and power meter and tasking you to sink every ball on the table before you ~die~  which occurs if you manage to scratch the cue ball into an open pocket, or if you go three shots in a row without sinking any balls.     The gameplay isn't too difficult to manage, because there's no timer or countdown clock forcing you to take quick action. You can take your time, line up your shots, and plan out your strategy for positioning your ball well after each shot  the only element that takes proper timing is in setting your shot's power. A meter in the upper-right corner of the screen bounces constantly back and forth from no power at all to maximum strength, like the swing meter you may be used to from golfing games, and you'll need to time your button-press properly to coincide with the level of oomph you want to put behind your shot.   Things get tricky in later tables, as obstacles, bumpers and inconvenient walls appear to impede your progress. It'll take quite a bit of skill to plan your shots in sequence in some of the later levels  there are 60, altogether  and you may find yourself headed to the Game Over screen even when you think you've concocted the perfect plan. Lunar Pool ends up being less of a sports simulation with a sci-fi twist, and more of a thoughtful, think-ahead puzzle experience that fans of that genre could certainly appreciate.   The experience is rounded out with a multiplayer option, which alternates control of the cue ball between two players anytime one of them fails to sink a shot. You can also play against the computer AI, which can be humbling  it's capable of pulling off some fairly impressive shots when it wants to.FCI published Lunar Pool back on the NES, and the fact that you have no idea who FCI is is encouraging. This is a game that, while not amazing, represents a greater collection of quirky, obscure, non-first-party 8-bit titles that would be great to see come to the Virtual Console. Not every great game of that era was made by the big name companies, or even companies that are still in the business of publishing video games, so let's hope Lunar Pool's arrival means more are on the way.As for the game itself, it's worth a look and an investment of 500 Wii Points if you're a puzzle fan, or a big billiards player. Goodness knows there's still plenty of room on the Wii for more worthy pool titles, as the most recent standalone attempt at the game is horrendous, and the most capable try before that was still just a mini-game at heart.", "date": "Oct 25, 2007"}
