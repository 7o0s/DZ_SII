The game has seen countless ports, enhancements and remakes over the years (including the addition of a multiplayer mode, or even uncovering the game itself as a reward in Excitebike 64). Even after such ~enhancements,~ it is the original that still remains loyal to the designs and aspirations of Miyamoto San from over two decades ago.   This game is classic NES fun.  The simple, reactive controls allow for optimal racing efficiency, as the player zips through track after track, sometimes colliding with huge barriers, or cutting off foes and sending them faces first into the dirt.  It does, however, come rife with some awfully frustrating inconsistencies and ambiguities, which shall be discussed.     There are two main gaming modes: Selection A allows the player to race solo against the clock;Selection B is the ultimate dirtbike extravaganza pitting you against bloodthirsty sprites.  All of those bikes on the screen comes at a price, though.  It's not because of framerate issues, which you first might guess - the game runs smoothly, with complex tracks and nifty animations (riders bounce atop their vibrating machines).  Rather, all of these cyclists create a chaotic environment, where there is no indication of who holds what position, and how far ahead the leader is.            Instead of numbers above the riders' heads, Miyamoto took a different approach.  Essentially it's a Rally Car race but the track is packed with opponents.  It doesn't matter who you leave in the dust, or who you cut off with a deft maneuver.  All those other bikers are more like obstacles than opponents. Instead, you are given one qualifying time, which you need to beat in order to advance to the actual Excitebike race. If you win the Excitebike race, you're automatically qualified for the next track's Excitebike race. For example, to get to the Excitebike race for track 4, you can either win track 3's Excitebike race, or beat the qualifying race for track 4. There are five tracks in total, and each track's qualifying race is easier than the previous track's Excitebike race. This enables players to skip right to the 5th (final, and very, very difficult) qualifier, if they so choose.   The game is packed with action and non-stop thrills.  The rider has a heat gauge at the bottom which is essentially overdrive.  Instead of pressing A for gas, B can be used like a nitrous boost of power - but only for a short period of time.  If the engine overheats due to excessive stress from boosting, the rider is pulled to the side and penalized a few seconds.  This is where the problems start to come in - time penalties.   With all the mayhem on the track, there are bound to be collisions, mistakes, and miscalculations.  However, each misadventure is arbitrarily penalized.  If you crash into another bike, you may be penalized one second and hop right back on.  But other times it could be as long as three or even four seconds - even though it was the same crash.  You could ride a perfect race, and accidentally lean back too far, and be penalized four seconds right before the finish line, when other times you may have just been penalized one second.  Further, races can't be restarted.  If you make a huge mistake, or feel there's no hope in Hades you'll make it to the end, the only recourse is to press the Home button and reset the game - it's actually fairly quick, but definitely a simple addition that Nintendo could have made for the VC release.  Aside from the arbitrary penalties and minor interface issues, the player always wants to hop right back on the bike for some more action.   Sound is used intuitively as the player is notified about the danger of overheating through whiny engine gasps, or how well his machine is performing as it scurries along under its regular power.  The game features no music, but I find that this in fact exemplifies the great sound effects, rather than acting as a detraction from the immersion factor of the game.     The graphics are simple, yet effective.  It's obvious what type of inclines jumps have, what the dirt looks like, and where the motorists are on the screen.  Any more flash than the game's charming simplistic presentation possesses, and there'd be no time to concentrate during the sheer speed.   If you're too frustrated by the aggressive AI, perhaps give the track building feature a try!  A good deal of replayability is added to the game through its simple (but flawed) track editor.  The player can create tracks to his heart's content, but each track piece is merely represented by a letter, A through Z, and no graphical representation.  This means that unless you memorize all the track pieces, or have the original NES manual, you could spend 15-20 seconds searching for a single piece.  Despite the somewhat restrictive interface, the editor itself is a welcome addition.  The game is ridiculously addictive.  Even after coming in 22nd place youll still want to try again.  Its easy to get frustrated by the games seemingly intent desire on making you suffer terribly, but lying underneath rests a truly enjoyable racing game, that proves video games dont need to have flashy graphics or complex AI to be actually fun.  Sure, there are other racing games out there today.  Hundreds.  This one may not necessarily be better than them, but its unique, addictive, and demonstrates what gaming is really about.  500 Wii points?  This one is clearly a no brainer.
