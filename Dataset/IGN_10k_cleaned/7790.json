For almost 48 months, I have reviewed hundreds upon hundreds of mobile games and it's been a fascinating trip. I've looked over old reviews to see just how fluid scores really are in the rapidly changing world of mobile. With new handsets released monthly and new tech amplifying the things developers can do with mobile gaming, it's simple to say that 9.0 score in 2004 would certainly not equal a 9.0 today. Expectations change, hardware changes -- review scores are a snapshot of what's happening at that moment. Unlike, say, the PlayStation 2, which has the same guts today that it had in 2000, the first mobile phone I used in 2003 would now be considered a dinosaur. I still have it, too: Samsung N400. It's slow. The screen is washed out. The thumb pad has a terrible delay. But playing SEGA Monkey Ball on it in 2003? That was a feat.   What does this have to do with Tornado Mania? I have been saving that perfect 10 rating for almost four years for a game that I finally believed would transcend the rapidly moving mobile arena. This is a game that I believe will be just as fun two years from now as it has been these last few weeks. It is a game that truly captures what mobile gaming is all about: Short bursts of clever fun, easily picked up by any player of any age or skill set, and builds on an innovative concept that no console game maker would bet the quarterly budget on. Mobile represents a wonderful landscape where developers can try out new, fresh ideas -- and that's been the mission of Digital Chocolate. The firm should be extremely proud of what they've accomplished in the space. From Tower Bloxx to Rollercoaster Rush to Mafia Wars: Yakuza, Digital Chocolate now refuses to coast. Tornado Mania is, to me, the culmination of the spirit that drives both mobile and Digital Chocolate -- a genius concept executed upon with brilliantly simple controls and excellent challenge-reward mechanics. It deserves this 10.   As you might expect, you control a tornado as it twists and turns across the world, swallowing everything in its path, from poor cows to massive skyscrapers. How you control the tornado is so simple. The tornado sweeps around the screen in a clockwise arc, always moving. If you don't touch anything, it moves in a good-sized circle. Pressing the OK key makes the tornado spin counter-clockwise. After just a few moments of practice, you can send that tornado snaking across a farm by pressing OK rhythmically. Encircling buildings just requires you to move into a building's range and then know exactly when to release the OK key so the twister surrounds it. And that's it. But from this simple control scheme springs an engrossing, incredibly creative game.   Tornado Mania is really two games in one -- making it a huge value, which has become of paramount importance to me -- a construction-oriented ~god game~ and an arcade-y romp where players are tasked to leave nothing but carnage in their path. Utopia, the construction game, plots out the efforts of a mad scientist to create a paradise from elements of the rest of the planet. Every year, the scientist sends out his industrial-produced tornados to scoop up buildings to perfect his paradise. At first, you just pick up small buildings, like a residential. However, to maximize the happiness of the utopian citizens, you must install industrial, cultural, and commercial buildings, such as museums and energy plants.   This segment of the game plays out like the city-planning element of Tower Bloxx, but greatly amplified. You must play around with paradise and discover which buildings make the happiest place on earth. No two utopias are likely to be the same, too. Every time you play Tornado Mania, you'd likely have to work to replicate the previous paradise.   Collecting these buildings is very, very fun. When the scientist sends the tornados out to get buildings, you rush into a variety of landscapes full of grasslands, roads, buildings, and other objects. To pick up a building, you must make the tornado rotate around it enough to loosen the foundation. When you position the tornado in the proper path, a small icon shows you how close you are to pulling up the building -- plus how much physical damage you are causing if the tornado's orbit is too close on one side. Smashing into buildings causes damage and if you destroy a structure, it's lost. The larger your tornado is, the easier it is to pick up larger, more important buildings. But to increase your tornado size, you must reach goals back at the biosphere paradise. Challenge and reward, my friends.   As intriguing and addicting as it is to create paradise by ripping up buildings, sometimes you just want to unwind with a little uncontrolled chaos. That's the essence of Rampage Mode, the second half of Tornado Mania. You hit the ground running with a massive tornado and a time limit. To move on to the next screen, you must destroy all of the buildings in the area. The first few maps are pretty straight-forward, but soon Rampage Mode becomes something of a puzzle game. You have to really chart out the best way to flatten the landscape before time runs out. Complications ensue when helicopters zoom in to drop dry ice in the tornado funnel, reducing its strength. You cannot destroy the chopper -- you must avoid them.   When you destroy buildings, you often reveal power-ups. A lightning bolt increases the tornado's speed. The heart increases the tornado size (very helpful if you've just been downgraded by a dry ice attack). The clock adds time to the meter -- always make an effort to grab these. The funnel icon gives you small satellite tornados that swirl around your main twister. These smaller tornados help destroy buildings, but more importantly, absorb damage from dry ice attacks.   Each of the game's halves is equally entertaining -- there are no dull moments in Tornado Mania whatsoever. I loved alternating between destructive bents and laying out my biosphere. Both of these modes were thought out, nothing feels just ~tacked on~ for the sake of having extra content. Everything snaps into place.   Tornado Mania enjoys some of the best production values in Digital Chocolate's history. First, I have to call special attention to the music. I like the Tower Bloxx theme an awful lot and the music samples for the club DJs in Nightclub Empire are great, but the score in Tornado Mania is superb. The track that accompanies the tornado as it rips up a whole city is excellent.   The graphics are smart and clean, but what amazed me in Tornado Mania are the little details. The tornado is constructed of layered discs that move independently of each other, giving it some real depth. When the tornado really starts tearing it up, you see elements from the things it lifts circling the outside of the funnel. If you wreak havoc in a pasture, you see cows and fence pieces in orbit. When you plow into a building, bits of the brick and mortar surround the funnel. The rest of the artwork is great, too, such as building design and the use of bright colors. This is a very pleasing game on the peepers.  Tornado Mania is Digital Chocolate's triumph and the best mobile game I have played since February of 2003, when I first joined IGN. I'm more than happy to award this 10 to the developers -- they earned every single decimal point. The game is accessible enough for any gamer, no matter the age, but with the depth that a more traditional player would seek out. The two halves of the game could have been standalone products, but having them together makes Tornado Mania an incredible value. And even though I said this game delivers on the promise of mobile gaming, I sincerely hope it sees a wider release than just handsets. The one button control of the tornado and the city-planning elements would be perfect for the Nintendo Wii. Congratulations to Digital Chocolate on such an achievement. And it's gonna be a whole new ballgame from here on out.", "date": "Dec 9, 2006"}
