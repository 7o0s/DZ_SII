If you're one of those fans that is equal parts excited and nervous for the live action movie, Glu Mobile's Transformers games might be a good measuring stick for your reaction. It lifts a lot of the elements from the movie, such as the robots' new forms and plot points that lead the Transformers on a quest for some galactic gee-gaw called the Allspark.   Upon booting up Transformers on an LG VX8600, I was immediately pleased to see Glu make the decision to use the handset as a way to immerse the player. Your mobile phone is hijacked, in a sense, by Bumblebee to help the Autobots outrun and out-fight the Decepticons. You will be running a mobile command center that appears as a series of digital nodes on your screen, directing Optimus Prime to his next mission and absorbing new intel. Along the bottom of the screen, a meter moves between an Autobot and Deception symbol, signifying how you're doing against your foes. I-play used this trick with their ~24~ games to great effect and the technique works quite well here, too.   However, when you do leave the command center and join Optimus Prime in battle, the experience takes something of a dip. This is a side-scrolling action game that hits all the necessary marks, but doesn't make the Autobots absolutely essential to the game -- you could almost swap Prime out for Leader-One of the Go-bots and leave the game as is. That's not a major dig at the game, because as a 2D action game, it works.   As Prime, you will run and drive across a series of levels set around the planet -- no spoilers, sorry -- using your massive cannon to bust up Decepticons. You must switch between a regular stance and an action stance when in proximity of trouble. In his combat stance, Prime automatically locks on and fires at the closest enemy robot. You cannot just leave Prime in his combat mode for the entire game, though, as his cannon can over-heat, leaving you temporarily defenseless. If you dare, you can close in on the Decepticon and let Prime go for a melee attack, pressing 1 or 3 when his fist glows red. Hit the button as just the right moment and Prime shatters some Decepti-jaws. Here's fun technique to juggle an enemy -- transform into the truck and ram the Decepticon, then get in close with robot mode and unleash an uppercut that knocks 'em into the air, and finally blast them with the cannon as they fall back to the ground.   In between battle scenes, the game employs the regular platforming mechanics -- lots of jumping around platforms, driving (instead of ducking) through tight spaces, and solving minor puzzles. Prime is not alone in his mission. When you happen upon a symbol next to a wall, for example, pressing OK unleashes Ironhide. Ironhide uses some sort of chemical compound called a Nova Spray to break through hard surfaces.   After four or so stages, Transformers settles into a rhythm. Run through a few action scenes, check for any extra routes and shortcuts to unlock new nodes on the mission map, and square off against a boss Decepticon, such as Barricade or Megatron. (I doubt mentioning Megatron spoiled anything. If so, sorry.) And once the groove is realized, the game just sits there. And no point is it unplayable, but it's not a barn-burner either. I've complained in the last few Gameloft reviews -- such as Pirates of the Seven Seas -- that there is a formula they've settled into, and Transformers feels like an extension of the formula.   The visuals are a mixed bag. The mission control screen, complete with the big Autobot faces, is exceptionally well done and really does make your handset look like a window into the game world. The robot sprites in the action scenes are only decently detailed and the Decepticon drones aren't terribly varied, but the trade-off appears to be for the sake of animation. Transforming and bashing robots is very smooth and little touches like seeing Prime's cab raise up when you drive off a ledge are good. The game has some sound effects that are likely from the film, just as the Bumblebee's squawking and little musical flourishes.   Glu Mobile's Transformers is a playable side-scrolling Optimus Prime-sim that should keep die-hard Autobot fans occupied while waiting in a monster line to see the movie next month. But that's really all it is -- a distraction. The decision to make your phone an integral part of the experience is super-smart, but when you drill down to the game play, you're left with just a regular platform/action game that happens to star the hero of every male child of the eighties. And as much as I like Optimus Prime -- I still have the original toy and can quote the animated movie by heart -- I just couldn't muster anything above ~mildly entertained~ while busting some Decepti-chops.", "date": "Jun 8, 2007"}
