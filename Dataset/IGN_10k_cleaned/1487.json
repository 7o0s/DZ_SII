With the success of Mario Party on the N64, the idea of a video board game suddenly becomes a hot idea that every console must have.  PlayStation has Crash Bash, and now, the Dreamcast has Sonic Shuffle.  Using the cell-shading technique that enchanted Jet Grind Radio, Sonic Shuffle certainly looks lovely, but how does it play?  Why don't I share a few comments of my esteemed co-workers as we played a four-player game earlier today:  ~(laughing out loud) I can't believe the load times in this game.~  Dave Smith  ~Is this game supposed to be fun?  What just happened?  Huh?~  Dave Zdyrko.  ~AHHH!  AHHH!  Turn it off!  I won't believe it!  A Sonic game has to be good!  GAH!~  Brandon Justice  Yes, dear readers... Sonic Shuffle, with its lovely visuals and stylized look, is one of the most boring Dreamcast games I've played.  Everything that can make a board game less enjoyable is done here... and I'm talking about load times up the wazoo, complex instructions, and too many options that will bewilder most players, especially during a multiplayer game.  Right about now, I bet most of you are preparing the flame mails of justice... how could a Dreamcast game featuring Sonic and company, be bad?  Hey, it surprised the hell out of me too and with a game this good-looking it's hard to believe the gameplay is poor.  The visuals in Sonic Shuffle are topnotch; the game board is filled with dazzling colors, wonderful textures, and delightful character.  As said above, the characters are styled with the cell shading technique, giving Sonic and cast a very cartoony appearance.  It's very pleasant on the eyes, and the characters all animate very smoothly.  The music is upbeat and voices, while a bit annoying, certainly add a lot of spunk to the characters.  Overall, the game is very, very nice to look at.  Of course, appearances are very deceiving, and the first flaw you'll run into isn't even part of the actual gameplay.  The load times in this game are unforgivable. Granted, Mario Party had the luxury of being on a cartridge so it had little to no load times.  I don't expect Sonic Shuffle to have absolutely no load time, but every time characters land on special tiles for mini-games, battles, duels, and other events, the game takes a while to load.   Then, after the specified event, it takes a long time to load the board again.  Imagine playing Monopoly where each player takes a full minute to prepare his turn and pass his turn to the next player.  Then comes the actual gameplay, and Sonic Shuffle plays very similar to Mario Party with some minor differences. Instead of a random dice roll, each character has a hand of cards with a number on them.  Choosing a card determines how many tiles you can move across the board.   You can also choose another player's card, though you will have no idea what the value of the player's card will be.  Once all players have used all their cards, the deck is reshuffled and another hand is dealt.  This is fine and dandy, but when it comes to moving, there are some issues.  First off, while there are special tiles for mini-games and mini-events, the majority of the tiles are blue (adding 3 rings to your character) or red tiles (subtracting three rings).  Thus, you never really get to play many mini-games with the other players.  This is one major flaw; in Mario Party, it was all about playing all sorts of neat mini-games against other players.  Decreasing the amount of mini-games was a bad move for Sonic Shuffle.  And when you finally get into a mini-game, most of them are pretty complex and you actually have to read through the instructions.  Mini-games should be simple enough where you can just jump in and you have a good idea of what's going on.  In addition, most of the mini-games are featured via four-way split screen, instead of having a large field of view.  While I can appreciate having large fields for mini-games, it's difficult to see anything within the small viewing screen.  The goal in the game is to get the Precioustones scattered across the board.  The Precioustone is a powerful gem filled with the dreams of being across the galaxy.  I wish could get one of these Precioustones and use it to give Sonic Shuffle a complete redesign.  Don't let the brilliant visuals sway you.  Anyone who gets Sonic Shuffle will pull their hair out in agonizing frustration... or have their hair pulled out by the friends playing this game.  --Anthony ~knows how to run~ Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 16, 2000"}
