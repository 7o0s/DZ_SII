This publisher has the development group to go to when it needs one: Fernando Velez and Guillaume Dubail's Game Boy Color team. Remember V-Rally and Wacky Racers? Those technical marvels were that team's doing, and Infogrames assigned the group to the task of bringing the next Test Drive game to the handheld, Test Drive Le Mans. Like the previous efforts from Velez and Dubail, the game looks great -- unfortunately, this latest rendition of this racing style is really beginning to show the ultimate weaknesses of making a game in this behind-the-vehicle fashion on the 8-bit portable. Features Arcade, Circuit, and Championship modes 10 different Le Mans vehicles Day, night, clear, foggy, and rain conditions. Battery save Only for Game Boy Color  It looks to us that Test Drive Le Mans is utilizing the same or similar graphics engine as the recently-released Wacky Racers.  Which means the game has a great simulated 3D feel with smoothly animated textured road and smoothly scaling roadside objects, and just an excellent sense of speed. Wacky Racers stole the overall wow-factor, but Test Drive Le Mans still manages to impress us by adding the ability to have more than two vehicles on-screen at once.  In this rendition, the game simulates the 24 hour endurance racing of Le Mans. What's that offer? Long laps and changing conditions throughout the circuit. As you race your vehicle around the massive tracks, day will turn to night, clear skies will turn rainy or even offer a thick layer of fog. This is another area where the racing graphics engine works extremely well -- object fade in realistically when it's night or foggy. These guys have this technique down pat.  To succeed in the Circuit and Championship modes, you'll have to pick the proper vehicles, choose the right tire for the road conditions, balance out the weight of the car by putting the right amount of fuel in the tank, and pick the exact engine for the feel of your acceleration tastes. As you race, your car will run out of fuel and take damage, and that's when you're going to need to use the pits to tweak your vehicle further. Also, there are a bunch of rules to follow on the circuit -- pass someone during a flag and you'll have to pit to take the penalty. The Arcade mode is slightly different -- powerups come into play to give your vehicle a bit of an edge. Tire powerups make your car stick to the road and tight turns, lightning bolts make your vehicle indestructable, lightbulbs remove the fog temporarily from the track, and an engine boosts your speed for a little bit.  Like Wacky Racers, the difficulty level and learning curve of Test Drive Le Mans is a bit on the high side. In fact, the controls in Le Mans make this game extremely difficult to play and enjoy -- your vehicle won't exactly react to a left or right turn right away. There's a defining delay in when your vehicle will respond to the d-pad controls -- this is intentional, unfortunately, since this is the developers way of giving vehicles and adjustments their own distinct feel. So, for example, when you pick up a tire icon, the controls get much tighter and the game is much easier to control. And since the vehicles are massive on-screen sprites, it's very difficult to pass without hitting them and losing precious speed. The game's a challenge, sure, but it's more on the annoying side.  And like Wacky Racers, Le Mans could have benefited further with a link-cable mode for two players. But looking at how much the graphics engine is pushing the system CPU, it's understandable why this wasn't included.  I honestly can't wait to see what this team will be able to accomplish with the Game BoyAdvance hardware -- these guys are pushing the Color hardware as far as it can go, itseems. The only real downside to Le Mans is the play balancing -- the sluggish controlsreally hurt the fun factor. A gamer can be wowed so much from a great game engine --but it's the playability that keeps him going. If the controls were tighter it would makefor an awesome game -- maybe even the best on the Game Boy Color. But as it is, it'smerely ~good.~ But it's MUCH better than the last two Test Drive's on the Game Boy Color, that's for sure.", "date": "Jul 8, 2000"}
