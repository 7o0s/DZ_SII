Some core element that's been taken away  but it's no mystery. It's the passwords. Kid Icarus is a classic Nintendo title, a platformer whose titular character has gathered himself a cult following of fans over the past 20 years. Those fans have raised their voices for decades now, crying out for a sequel, a rebirth, anything. Any sign that their winged hero was still alive and recognized by his parent company, and here it is  but it's incomplete. Kid Icarus is back, but his secrets are lost.   This Virtual Console version of the classic Kid Icarus is the first time since 1991 that angelic archer Pit has been back on the market. His last game, Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters, was a Game Boy release  a solitary sequel that seemed to say that a steady series was sure to come. But it never did. The Kid Icarus franchise ended there, only two games ever made. The fans were not happy.   And they're sure to be angered again, now that the original game has arrived in edited form. Nintendo removed the passwords. Not the level progress passwords, those still work. But the cool ones. The cheat code passwords. Classic cheats  like ~ICARUS FIGHTS MEDUSA ANGELS~ and ~8uuuuu uuuuuu uuuuuu uuuuuu~  no longer function, their entry simply taking you to an error screen. It's ridiculous. Where's the logic behind altering a classic game like that? We've seen incomplete titles on the Virtual Console before, an example being Mario Kart 64's non-support of Ghost Data saves in Time Trial mode. But that one you could explain away as laziness, or as a technical issue with the emulation. That's not the case here. Here, Nintendo's willfully edited its product, and damaged its nostalgic value in the process.   It's not an issue worthy of a prolonged rant, but it's important to point out and call attention to  of the over 50 games now available on the Virtual Console, Kid Icarus is the only one to have had content retroactively removed. It's something to look out for in the future.   Luckily, the core game is still intact. The core game that you may have never played, but have certainly heard about over the years  Pit's platforming adventure through Angel Land. Kid Icarus was the sister game to Metroid. Both had a lot of elements and programmers in common, but Kid Icarus stuck to a tradition style of level progression. Complete 1-1, go to 1-2, fight a boss at the end of each fourth stage. The key difference with Kid Icarus was its orientation  you don't side-scroll, you scroll up.   Well, OK, the second world is side-scrolling. And the dungeon levels are different. But Kid Ick's vertically laid-out levels have always been its signature, along with its lofty degree of challenge. As a little winged kid with a bow and arrow, you start this game with meek and humble status. And, as such, it's tough. You jump up the levels, enemies swarming you from all sides, platforms small and difficult to land on precisely and, to top it off, you're constantly scrolling away the ground that used to be below you.   If you should happen to misjump and fall into the black abyss, you're finished  unless you have a feather. The item will save you from a plummeting doom, as your wings kick into gear and you fly back up to land on firm, floating earth. Kid Icarus has a lot of items, actually. Weird, wacky collectibles like chalices, and pencils, and credit cards. The system for earning hearts  Angel Land's currency  and cashing them in for goods in mid-level shops is odd. A lot of the Kid Icarus game design is odd. This is one of those games that made a lot more sense back in the '80s, accompanied by a tips and tricks strategy sheet, or a Nintendo Power guide. Removed from its context 20 years ago, the title just doesn't hold up as well.  Kid Icarus on the Virtual Console is a tough target to hit. On one hand, it should earn a recommendation based on its history, its cult following, and the fact that its central character is finally coming back into the spotlight (through Super Smash Bros. Brawl) after an absence of so many years. On the other hand, this game design hasnt aged in as timeless a manner as many other first-party Nintendo games from the NES era, and the removal of key, nostalgic passwords is nonsensical. Kid Icarus is still a good game, and theres still fun to be had in Angel Land  but theres just something missing.", "date": "Mar 6, 2007"}
