{"name": "Dragon Rage", "name_review": "Dragon Rage", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/12/10/dragon-rage", "text": "The notion behind Dragon Rage is a good one. Just like Peter Molyneux wanted to make a game back in the mid-1990s in which players could finally play as the bad guys (Dunegon Keeper), 3DO has created title in which players get to play the normally super-evil, on-dimensional character of a dragon. As a major part of medieval literature, and always starring in bits and bobs of Western myth and lore, dragons always have been the bad guys, more of less.   With relatively recent films such as Dragon Heart and even Dungeons and Dragons, dragons have made a small and relatively ineffective comeback, but at least they have showed dragons to be something other than evil, careless, human hating. Games, however, haven't done such a good job of it (Spyro The Dragon being the exception since it's a platformer, not a shooter). Where for art thou Panzer Dragoon?   With 3DO's Dragon Rage, players get the chance to take on the role of a powerful dragon, flying, blasting fireballs, and terrorizing orc villages, and it's quite a fun game. Dragon Rage, once known as Dragon Wars, portrays Cael, a dragon who has been chosen to help free the rest of the dragon tribe from an industrious civilization of orcs that have enslaved and systematically killed them off to near extinction.   3DO's game is a decent one: It's relatively easy to pick up and play, it fulfills a kind of shooter urge that nearly every gamer has, and the variety of gameplay is decent. It's not a stunning game in any way, but for the lower price of $29.99, it's a worthwhile buy.   Gameplay  The chief role of this game is to get gamers into the feel of being a dragon. Cool by me, and 3DO has done a decent job of doing it. Playing as Cael, gamers get to act like a powerful dragon, one who can fly, shoot projectiles, and terrorize and eat various farm animals, without ever landing or walking on all fours. But more importantly, players have the chance to fly freely around in large, enclosed environments. Following the leadership of a sexily-clad and rambunctious sprite, whose folks also have been enslaved by the orcs, Cael blasts through what seems like dozens of levels of blasting, objective-based missions, and gets the chance to become a hero.    The missions are average, and they pull and push Cael in to all kinds of dangerous situations, but they also start off with Cael going though a kind of training period to learn how to use his abilities. This first training level proves to be invaluable, because while the basics of Dragon Rage are pretty easy to pull off, special moves and the clutch use of power-ups is key to passing these levels. They actually require some work. The game's learning curve steepens right away, after the third level, and if you weren't paying attention earlier, you'll be playing through level three and four many times over.   Otherwise, the levels vary from wiping out entire landscapes of evil orcs and their villages to collecting eggs to containing orcs from running away, and include combinations of these. In some cases, Cael is on a time limit, while in others he simply has to crush his opponents before they get from point A to Point B. The collection of eggs level reminds me of the same mini-game concept first seen in Diddy Kong Racing, but the whole game feels different than anything else in that game, or for that matter, from the likes of the old Sega Saturn game Panzer Dragoon. The levels do eventually blur, becoming a little tedious with repetition.    Still, Dragon Rage feels better than average. Cael moves pretty fluidly and responds quickly enough, and his stock of moves is plentiful. There is even at least one move that's been borrowed from Army Men: Air Attack. Remember the winch? Cael can pick up and huck giant stones at enemy structures and AI, and it's still cool. They even kept the same winch sound effect, which is a little goofy.   Using the Dual Analog controller, players have a decent assortment of moves to pull off. This dragon is mobile to such a degree he can pull off loops, barrel roll, and exercise reversals, all in mid-air, at the touch of a button. The camera usually follows Cael with enough room, and never really gets in the way at all. But funnily enough, Cael himself gets in the way of the camera. I'm sure the folks at 3DO thought about this, but the camera seems a little low at times, and when Cael does get in the way it's annoying.   The biggest problems I encountered with the control come in the form of sharp turns, or rather, the lack of. While Cael can pull off reversals and barrel rolls, I really truly wished I could fly more precisely with him. There is the R3 move, which stops Cael in mid-air, and enables him to strafe, but it's not a good solution for precision pick up and good maneuverability. I often missed powerup triangles and orcs and in close-range situations. Overall, the control structure is unfinished and clumsy, and the lack of overall precision with Cael is becomes a hindrance.   Cael finds that his fire-powered breath can be altered for various kinds of destruction. His default projectiles are fireballs, but he can shoot barreling balls of destruction, ice balls and other things by picking up powerups. Adara also upgrades his powers, too. Cael also can perform a special powerful attack when players press Triangle. All power is monitored by the amount of mana Cael has, and with each projectile shot, it decreases.    The weird and funniest thing about this game is the placement of importance on cows. Cows are the main feeding source for Cael, but they also help him grow in power. Yep, just like in India, cows are sacred, but unlike in India, the main goal in Dragon Rage is to slaughter them relentlessly. By eating cows, Cael's health and mana are returned to full form, and by collecting as many as five cows Cael can then drop their souls in a bizarre cow soul chamber, several of which are found in every level. What's hilariously weird is that an in-game cut-scene shows Cael dropping off cow souls, and with each one you hear an echoing cow moo that made me feel very weird indeed...   Graphics  Dragon Rage is by no means a next-generation graphic blockbuster, but it's by no means a horrible looking game, either. What generally happens with 3DO games on PS2 is that they tend to repeat textures, and those textures are plain and forgettable in the first place. There isn't a high importance put on artwork ever, but 3DO's CG work always has been good, and the CG is no exception here. The opening CG Adara and Cael is cute.   The backgrounds here are decent, but like I said before, like the textures, they too are forgettable. The giant landscapes are free from too much variation, except for color. But on the flip side, there is a lot of commotion going on in each level. Orcs and spell casting fiends are scattered everywhere, and the Orc captains carry with them a horde of baddies that walk on foot or ride strange four-legged creatures. And nearly every structure in the game can be destroyed by Cael's erm... ~powerful~ breath.    Plus, there are also humans, sheep, cows, and pigs running around, too. One of my favorite animations is watching Cael eat another animal. He wriggles his head around and then the animals burst into an exploding balloon of flying giblets. It's gory and cartoonish but it never gets dull.   Which leads me to Cael himself. The animation on Cael isn't perfect, and there is some obvious need for improvement, but overall, he moves with enough fluidity and grace to look cool. Cael is well designed from the get-go, and the guys from 3DO obviously know what they wanted. Cael is a four-legged creature, with a tail, and two giant wings that aren't in any way related to his forepaws. In short, he's a good D&D replica of a dragon, albeit a little simplified, and that's just cool. The wing movement is accompanied by sounds of swooping and the wing movement is well animated. The basic animations blend from one move to another without any major hitches, and overall, it's a pleasure to just play around with Cael and watch him move. Overall, he's a cool looking dragon.   Sound  Sound has never been a strong point with any 3DO game, and Dragon Rage is no exception. But at least here, the stock-sounding orchestration of medieval themes, which revels in pounding drums and epic progressions, the selection of music is appropriate and works well.   As for the sound effects, what one hears the most of is a collection of Cael swooping, animals getting crunched into gibs in Cael's mouth, and arrows whooshing across the sky. You never hear from Cael, except a grunt or two in the initial cutscenes, but you do hear a lot -- and I mean far too much -- from the little Sprite by the name of Adara. She's a British sprite with a glitzy French-cut fairy suit, and she talks a lot, which is naturally her job, she is the narrator. At first, she's kind of endearing, but sooner than later, she's rather irritating, although I suppose Navi (Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time) was far worse in the category of sheer irritation.I always have liked dragon games (call me the sucker that I am), and the Panzer Dragoon series is one of my favorites on the Sega Saturn. So naturally, the lure to play as a dragon in 3DO's game was difficult to avoid. But despite my initial attraction, Dragon Rage is a good concept that offers basic gameplay goodness but falls apart in the implementation. The most interesting hook for Dragon Rage is that it's not selling for $49.99, it's retailing at a MSRP of $29.99, and for that it's a good deal. What's cool about this game is that Cael is free to fly and fight in full 3D, and his palette of powers is broad. There are some basic problems with the game, and the overall concept works but it just gets a little tedious and in some cases it seems the game is not very well balanced. For casual gamers, this game will prove to be frustrating, and for hardcore gamers, the gameplay itself isn't broad enough or deep enough to keep them interested.", "date": "Dec 10, 2001"}
