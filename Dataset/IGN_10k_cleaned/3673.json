No arms!~ hero from French software house Ubi Soft, is stepping out of the console world that made him famous for a go-go adventure on your cellphone.  Rayman 3, timed and titled to capitalize on the most-recent chapter of his console adventures, looks more like his original side-scrolling romp from the Jaguar days, but that was a decidedly fun game.  Does this handset edition manage to mirror the fun, too?  Features: 9 levels Save system  Rayman 3 is a classic, side-scrolling platformer, and nothing else.  Now, if you're still digging that genre, read on.  (Otherwise, get back to your whore-bashing in Grand Theft Auto.)  The limbless wonder must run from right to left, defeating enemies, negotiating tricky jumps, and collecting lums.  Sounds as basic as can be, but that's why it's such a perfect game for a cellphone.  Rayman is a man of many talents.  Not only can he throw his fist and bash a baddie from ten feet away, but he also use his two-pronged helicopter hair to float from ledge to ledge.  You need both of these skills to manage the nine levels of lum-loving mischief.  Especially the propellerhead, as this is a side-scroller with some serious vertigo.  Levels stretch vertically as much as they do horizontal, and you need to master the glide to successfully avoid falling to your doom.  (Apparently, as talented as this Man of Ray is, he has not yet mastered the fine art of swimming.  Perhaps he just ate before you started the game.)  You begin your adventure is a lush, green paradise that has been taken over by marauding marauders.  Use your fist o' fury to knock them out, as well as free trapped captive lums from their cages.  Two hits oughtta do it.  Rayman can also climb up vine walls that miraculously float in mid-air.  Look everywhere for a platform you can jump to, it's the only way to collect all the lums in a level.  Clear out the garden, and it's into the caves, where things get a wee bit harder.  Enemies are certainly more plentiful, and environmental hazards less forgiving.  Use that helicopter hair to naviage tunnels lined with sharp rocks, and try to stay on magical moving platforms that whizz across lakes of burning hot magma.  All while collecting those lums.  Platformers leave or die by their control, usually because successful jumping is essential to complete levels.  Here's where Rayman gets his black eye.  Making successful jumps is a bit of a chore, thanks to a combo of floaty physics and that psky, little keypad.  Of course, the number pad is an option, but on our Nokia 3650, with its radial number pad, it's a minor nightmare.  Several times, Rayman ended up in the drink, thanks to ill-timed jumps that we were never convinced were entirely our fault.  Of course, it doesn't help that since the screens on most cellphones are vertically oriented, to you don't get much of a warning for the approach of that next floating platform.  Visually, Rayman 3 is very, very appealing.  As expected, Rayman's world is a vibrant joint, with gorgeous greens and blues.  Of course, the slick screen of the Nokia 3650 helps.Characters are extremely well animated, too, especially ol' Rayman.  Watch his hands swing back and forth as he crosses tight ropes.  Well done, Gameloft.  Too bad the game is fairly silent, save for an opening melody a few scattered sound effects,  When will cellphone game makers start putting some serious audio into their games?I was a huge Rayman fan on the Saturn and Jaguar, and I think platformers don;t get much better than Rayman 2: The Great Escape.  So, I was a bit of a mark for this handset game from Gameloft.  While the control disappointed me--this is partially due to the tech, not the developer--I still had a great time with my limbless buddy.
