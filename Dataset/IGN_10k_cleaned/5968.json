Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3D is a startling port of the 1999 hit game that essentially ushered in an entire new genre of video game -- extreme sports fueled by massive thumb-twisted combos -- that was oft-copied, but never truly duplicated. JAMDAT reached out to Ideaworks3D to bring the original masterpiece to mobile (a good firm to choose, as evidenced by their work on EA Mobile's Need for Speed Underground 2), and their port is certainly technically impressive.   Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3D is bursting with skate park acreage that demands to be grinded. All of the levels you grew to love in the original, such as the Mall and Burnside, have been stuffed into this mobile edition, and the architecture is definitely en tact. The most well-known of these levels are undoubtedly the Warehouse and the School and fans of the series will certainly enjoy seeing them again on the smallest screen. The jumps and rails that gave you ample opportunity to perform the trademark moves that propelled the game to such great heights are indeed front and center.   Whether or not you can actually perform these tricks with a degree of accuracy is something else entirely -- as playing Tony Hawk on a cellphone is certainly a different experience than playing on a PlayStation. For one thing, the control scheme is a little complex. Because you cannot hold down multiple buttons to pull off tricks, you have to instead go for button sequences that sometimes feel fine, but more complex tricks seem a little off. It takes practice to get a good score, because all too often, you'll botch an entire trick sequence because of a bad button-push or a trick animation that hasn't finished because your button-tapping started too late.   There were definitely moments of frustration when trying to string together some combos. For a fan of the franchise, there will be a degree of disconnect at first. It's hard to shake off legacy tactics in a Hawk game, and I wonder if newcomers won't have a better experience than bruised veterans.   When you do start to get the hang of the controls, you'll find that meeting the goals is a lot easier. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3D fashions some new level objectives that are more suitable for a mobile experience and add an extra degree of challenge. Completing goals earn points that unlock additional levels and new skateboards. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3D also features an online scoreboard where you can post your point totals for the world to marvel at.   On an LG VX8000, my test phone, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3D features some rather large real estate. As the game shuffles textures in and out of memory, the game occasionally struggles with draw-in issues, but never to the detriment of the game. The skater models, such as Tony Hawk, feature a good amount of detail with defined appendages and clothing. The animations are fairly smooth, too, and some of the tricks look quite nice when perfectly executed.   I was a little bummed to not hear any of the tunes that made the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater soundtrack such a classic, especially after the advent of things like EA Trax and other MP3-fueled soundtracks. However, the skateboarding sound effects are good and crisp, and I suppose those are what really matters.  To see Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3D up and running on a cellphone is a minor marvel indeed -- but I cannot contain my disappointment that I was playing the 1999 edition of a series that has made significant strides. There are moves and features in later editions that greatly improved on the 1999 template, and if you follow the franchise with any degree of fervency, you'll miss them like I did.However, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3D is still a good V CAST to pass the time with -- either between classes or on a bus ride. The way the level goals have been restructured is good for mobile sessions. Getting the trick system down will take some practice, though, so hang up your Dual Shock experience and get ready to re-learn what you have already mastered. The amount of content, though, cannot be criticized. There is no shortage of real estate to grind, and it will take a few hours to see it all.", "date": "Aug 29, 2005"}
