Such is the situation that KOEI Corporation has experienced since the smash success of Dynasty Warriors 3 and its incredibly striking numbers when it first appeared in Japan as Shin Sangokumusou 2 back in 2001. Already revisited with the special add-on pack Xtreme Legends in late 2002, the expectation of another sequel to the Dynasty Warriors series was about as likely as death and taxes. And with the final touches on the American version of DW4 now a distant memory, KOEI is poised once again to shatter sales records and increase its dominance of the action/slasher market.   Developed by the battle experts at Omega Force, Dynasty Warriors 4 returns to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms era with plenty of gusto. Addressing several graphical problems, character balancing issues, and deepening its value with several new gameplay elements, it could definitely be received as the best in the series (though XL fans would be happy to debate that with you). If hacking and slashing your way through hordes of enemy soldiers isn't your idea of a good time, however, then DW4 may not be your cup of tea.   Gameplay  The DW series is about as basic as you can get: Select a character, equip them with a plethora of badass weapons, and send them into battle against hundreds, sometimes thousands of enemies until there's nothing left to kill. Yet despite its simple premise, the games always find a way to transcend their humble beginnings and become so much more than a typical hacker. Whether it's the RPG-like progression of its characters, the historically accurate settings, or the sheer amount of enemies coming at you at any one time, Dynasty Warriors is inspiring proof that the sum can be a much greater whole than its parts.    That tradition continues with Dynasty Warriors 4. As this time Omega Force has gotten really ambitious with what it's decided to include and has improved various gameplay systems for the better. In fact, there have been so many changes made to this year's edition of Shin Sangokumusou, that it's difficult to pinpoint an area in which to begin. That said; the most impressive addition to Dynasty Warriors 4 has to be the improved enemy intelligence and the way it approaches every battle.   The improvement itself is really quite simple; Omega Force has altered the behaviors of the enemies from patterns to reactions. Or rather, they've become less predictable. In the past, you knew that when traveling through the opening stages of the Yellow Turban Rebellion that the same set of opponents would always be near the drawbridge as you entered the premises.   In Dynasty Warriors 4, that isn't the case at all. This time, the enemies rush you if you get close or run away when you're kicking butt. No two games we played were ever the same in terms of enemy strategy, and it wasn't uncommon to find ourselves standing our ground to fight off hordes of aggressors in one turn while chasing their cowardly carcasses around the stage in the next. This dynamic alone already made DW4 a considerable improvement over the last game.    To make things even more enticing, the difficulty of the enemies have increased as well. Previously difficult only when playing the harder challenge levels against superior officers, everything you engage in DW4 is potentially dangerous now. From the highest general to the lowest infantryman, your fingers will be given a workout. The main reasoning for this fact is that enemies block on a more frequent basis now, and no longer keep themselves open to your hostility. They also attack one and two at a time instead of waiting for one guy to go before swinging their weapon; don't be surprised if you find yourself being juggled by the attacks of three or four different foes of varying ranks. There are still instances of the ~wait and see~ mannerisms we saw in the last two games, mind you. But nowhere near the level they used to be.   Complimenting the smarter enemies and their techniques are the more open and less-canned environments. Still based on the same familiar areas we experienced in Dynasty Warriors 2 & 3, there's a lot more variety to the terrain and missions in this manifestation. As you progress, players will be able to choose which side they fight for before every fight (in free mode only) and can finally select whatever character they want preceding each battle regardless of who they chose in the previous conflict (with the guideline being that your starting character is housed within the same Kingdom). There are almost twenty stages in all with well over 50 different areas, and various sections of these areas have multiple paths of approach and destructible elements. There are even randomly generated portions of stages that can serve as ambush spots based on what characters you're using; Very surprising, and very cool.   One heralded new feature that doesn't quite live up to its potential is the promised ~Siege Engine~. A new technique that allows gamers to build war machines like catapults and battering rams, the ~siege engine~ isn't so much a new gameplay feature as it is a cut scene viewer. All you have to do is find the right area and siege commander to activate its construction and the game does the rest for you. Not quite the revolution we were hoping for. And come to think of it, neither is the all-new taunt button that's supposed to scare off your enemies when surrounded. It's entirely for show, and doesn't really do much of anything.    Which leads us into Dynasty Warrior's altered control scheme. Identical to DW3 on the surface, there are a couple of changes worth noting that make things for the better; the first of which is a better combo system. Now capable of reaching numbers as high as the 20s, finding the proper sequence of buttons to juggle and maim a group of opponents is a key ingredient to wading your way through the more difficult enemies. Moreover, players now have specialized Musou attacks and throws based on which character they're using and can even challenge other generals to one-on-one duels when meeting certain conditions. Faster and more challenging than typical boss battles, the duels can be as nerve-racking as a 30-on-1 battle can be.   And yet, there are even more tweaks to speak of: Hitting opponents with missile attacks isn't as easy as it used to be, and in all honesty, arrow damage as a whole has been toned down for friend and foe alike. One change that we really liked, though, is the addition of several new mounts (like the Storm Runner and Shadow Runner horses) and the ability to use an elephant on every stage should you have the proper inventory. The lack of power-ups and bonuses are another welcome difference as well; the item-litter of the last game was a little ridiculous.    Also on the more inviting side of things, character progression is a lot more difficult to achieve (but why did KOEI get rid of titles for your ranking? Level numbers just aren't as cool) and blazing through some a couple of stages with a super character after one play through is no longer a possibility. Of particular note is the modified weapons upgrade system that lowers the amount of times you'll find a new addition to your arsenal in favor of a level-up system similar to character experience. You'll still find new swords, staves, and the like, but you'll hang onto your originals for a lot longer. Other new bonuses like additional mounts, new officers, more intelligent bodyguards, and elemental weapon attachments make your character more flexible than ever before. You can even create and edit four of your own generals and import them into the storyline.   Dynasty Warriors 4's biggest adversary though, has to be its repetition. The franchise's enemy since its inception, your characters aren't going to do anything besides annihilate the competition over and over again. That type of gameplay can definitely separate its audience type rather quickly. For what it is though, DW4 tries extremely hard to avoid the boredom normally associated with such things, and most definitely succeeds.   Graphics  It's safe to assume that Omega Force has pushed the Dynasty Warriors graphical engine about as far as it can go. Already impressing audiences with the product they created in Dynasty Warriors 3, the fourth installment has fixed a lot of the problems associated with that game's already marvelous presentation. For starters, the framerate is much better: with smoother animation and greater character speed when playing two-player battles. Single player is even more remarkable with further enemies displayed onscreen at one time and a healthy dose of new particles and special effects.    Character models themselves are less refined, with the same level of quality and detail found in the last game. Not that that's a bad thing necessarily, as Dynasty Warriors 3 had some admirable textures and architecture. As an added bonus, you can unlock five extra costumes for every character (some of which are really bizarre) and the transparency effects are a lot healthier. Not mentioning all the excellent color usage and object-heavy stages, however, would be nothing short of a crime.   Dynasty Warriors 4 still has a few technical limitations though. The draw-distance has yet to improve an inch since it was first introduced in part 2, and destructible objects like the tents and crates are pretty basic when compared to other games with similar abilities. Also, despite the improvements we mentioned with the framerate earlier, there is still a noticeable amount of slowdown in the more populated areas. Regardless, DW4 looks great.   Sound  There's been an excess of pre-release disappointment surrounding the lack of Japanese vocals in Dynasty Warriors 4, and to an extent we can understand why: The English voices are terrible. Bordering on ~average~ during its best moments, the individual speeches are a healthy mix of terribly inflated British enunciation and enthusiastic California-dude accents.    On the flipside, the game takes place in Ancient China, so hearing them speak in the game's original Japanese track doesn't make much sense either. Of course, this is the first time in recent memory that KOEI has seen fit not to include the choice between the dialects, so none of that matters anyway. Perhaps when Dynasty Warriors 5 comes down the pipeline over the next few years, KOEI will subtitle it appropriately and change the voices to Chinese where they belong.   Moving forward, the score is still the same guitar-heavy ass-metal we've become familiarized with over the last couple of years. And even though there are a couple of more diverse and eclectic songs in this version, casual fans will likely not even notice. Headbangers and those who own soundtracks to movies like Roadhouse or Rockstar, however, will definitely get a kick out of the ear pounding that's been created by Omega Force's obviously '80s-impassioned composer. More traditional fans of the time period will probably scramble for their television's mute button though.   At least the sound effects are decent with plenty of bangs and clangs to be happy about. Crowd charges and explosions in particular really stand out in the heat of the battle, and they accompany the onscreen action rather nicely. Unfortunately, there isn't any kind of high-end audio support in Dynasty Warriors 4 whatsoever. Instead, we're left with nothing more than your standard monaural and stereo options. Whoops.Dynasty Warriors 4 has everything that fans could have hoped for: More stages, balanced characters, smarter computer intelligence, and plenty of different modes to choose from (the Encyclopedia and Two-Player mode stand out as favorites). What it doesn't have, however, is innovation. Improved as the game may be, it's the same repetitive beast that it's always been and players looking for the next evolution of the action genre will be sorely disappointed. Especially once they hear the terrible verbiage of an Ancient Chinese British accent.Repetition and bad voice acting aside, DW4 still manages to advance the series in a forward direction. Refined to a point that battle enthusiasts will surely appreciate, Dynasty Warriors 4 is about as honed as a fan could hope for. In fact, it's still one of the best action games around -- no matter how familiar it may seem. Bet on it!", "date": "Mar 21, 2003"}
