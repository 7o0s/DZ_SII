Each year they promise to put out games of high quality with some ~ESPN flare~ and each year they fail miserably.  Well, this year is no different.  ESPN NFL Prime Time 2002 is worse than bad, it's boring. Features  Bottom of the screen ticker features scores, stats, controls and more ~Inside the Numbers~ ESPN research info Four unique player models based on position 120 player faces Day, night and twilight games. Animated crowds and variable attendance Full NFL license, NFLPA license and stadiums. 500+ unique player animations ESPN camera angles and presentation  Game Modes In Prime Time, you can choose an exhibition game, franchise mode, or practice.  There is no season mode separate from franchise mode, which is kind of junky.  It's certainly an easy enough option to have.  Some folks don't want to have to go through the franchise hassles.  A minor point, but just strike one of many against this game.  The Franchise mode is well done with options to allow you to fully customize your team.  You can perform a fantasy draft (a must have in my opinion) or trade freely with other teams.  If you've had trouble with pesky trade rejections in other football games, fear not.  You can trade Ryan Leaf for Brett Favre without objection.  While the franchise mode is nice, the menus throughout the game are a jumble.  You have to use the triggers and the D-Pad to navigate through this mess.  Frustration should not occur prior to even starting a game. Prime Time comes with the usuals--all current NFL teams (no Houston Texans), with all the stadiums, uniforms, and cheerleaders.  There's no create-a-team or create-a-player modes, though you can edit current players. Gameplay Prime Time is no Madden or NFL 2k2.  The controls are clunky and often unresponsive.  The play calling menu is full of plays, but the execution is lacking.  More than once, JJ Stokes would bump into Terrell Owens on a route and actually push him to the side.  Instead of adjusting, Owens just keeps on going in his new path.  Meanwhile, the ball I've just tossed his way is headed to where he was supposed to go.  Nothing in Prime Time feels quite right.  The passing game lacks the control of Madden and the running game isn't very accurate.  Trying to bust runs up the middle is a joke.  Even when holes exist, it doesn't seem you can make it through them without being stuck in place.   And then there are the times where you seem to lose control of the player altogether.  A few times when I'd snap the ball, Jeff Garcia wouldn't respond to me, he'd just start running a bootleg.  The passing icons would only come up after a few seconds, which was way too late.  When I'm playing a game, I want to be in control at all times. To further kill the joy from the gridiron, it's nearly impossible to break tackles.  Once a man gets near you, you go down nine out of ten times.  Trust me, the Chargers secondary do not wrap people up -that- well.  The same works for when you are on defense.  Just get near a guy and you're almost certain to take him down. Graphics Another spot where Prime Time fails to impress.  The players look strange, especially when in action.  Sometimes you'll see arms stretching oddly.  The faces are blocky, like you're playing with team Bizarro.  The coaches aren't differentiated from one another and the stadiums fail to catch the flavor of an NFL game.  Balls are caught, even when they don't actually go near the hands of receivers and players bodies slide mysteriously after hitting the ground.  No, the graphics aren't horrendous (especially when compared to the PS2 version), but they are far below the standard set by Madden and NFL 2k2.   Sound Prime Time features the commentary of famed ESPN broadcasters Chris Berman and Tom Jackson.  The commentary has a nice feel to it, much more cozy than found in most other games.  Both offer comments you've heard before on ESPN broadcasts.  Berman will tell you ~he could... go... all... the... way!~ and TJ will lay down a lot of knowledge about players and teams.  The stadium and player sounds are almost non-existent.  And with Bermy and TJ doing play by play, it kinda feels like you're watching the game on TV instead of being on the field delivering brutal hits.    ESPN NFL Prime Time 2002 is lacking in every category.  It cannot measure up to any of the other Xbox football games.  I never really felt like I was in the game and more importantly, I just didn't have any fun.  Prime Time can't decide if it wants to be a sim or more of an arcade title.  It flounders between the two, failing to capture any of the excitement of football.  Any of the other Xbox football titles would be a better choice than this one.
