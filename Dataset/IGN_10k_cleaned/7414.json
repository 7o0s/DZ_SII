That's probably because the game is actually a lot of fun. It certainly feels a lot like a well produced mod of Battlefield 2 but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Weapons and kits seem pretty balanced, maps are well designed and exciting in general, and their persistence system isn't half bad when it actually works. It doesn't have the crazy frenzied oomph that we've come to expect from Battlefield, but there's a lot of entertainment to be found. Those looking for explosive changes to gameplay aren't going to find them, even with the new Titan mode, but DICE has definitely spent some time refining some of the features.    The core gamplay basically remains the same. Conquest mode is back and unchanged, which much of the BF community will be happy about. It provides the same fast-paced gameplay across maps that vary in success. Probably the best thing about these maps is that the load times seem to have been significantly reduced from those in Battlefield 2. Certainly nice not to have to wait five minutes per map. The city maps like Belgrade, Cerbere Landing, and Fall of Berlin are very exciting as are the crowded Camp Gibraltar and Tunis Harbor. While vehicle lovers will probably find some of the more open maps appetizing, the designs are less interesting from an infantry perspective, which is where most players will be spending their time.    Part of the issue with the vehicle heavy maps is that the vehicles aren't exceptionally interesting. Over 130 years into the future it seems like technology might have spawned more than simple tanks and jeeps. Flying vehicles act a bit like helicopters. They're much harder to crash, which makes sense, though it does cut down on the challenge of flying. The most interesting vehicle is probably the anti-grav tank that glides over the landscape. It's a slow moving beast with an set cannon (no swivel, just tilt) but can strafe from side to side. Bland vehicles and color palettes are forgivable if a bit sad. The cold and dark future Earth is something we've come very accustomed to in video games. It wouldn't hurt to add at least a little bit of color. In some ways it's suitably depressing but just isn't particularly interesting to look at.    With a number of revisions and additions, Titan mode is the largest. Titan is played across one of five 48 player maps. Instead of control points, missile silos are scattered around the environment. Every so often, they'll fire a missile. It's up to each team to uplink and capture the silos by standing near to them and hold them long enough to fire a missile at the enemy Titan ship. Enough missile hits and the Titan shield will drop. At this point, infantry takes the lead by assaulting the huge flying base. The issue is simply getting there. Players can either fly transport and attack vehicles over to the enemy Titan or launch from a mobile personnel carrier. These transport vehicles can shoot pods high up into the air at which point the soldier inside can steer enough for the pod to land on the Titan deck and assault the craft.   Many of the games of Titan have been pretty disorganized, but when you get a good group of players that are obviously working in teams, the mode becomes very exciting. Indoor battles can be intense and games can be won and lost in the defense of a Titan. Once commanders learn to issue specific defense and attack orders to squads (and once players learn to join a damn squad so they can be issued orders) once both Titan shields are down, things will get even better. Either way, this objective mode is definitely a welcome addition to players like us that appreciate having a substantial goal to go after rather than arbitrary points that tick down over time. When an enemy Titan explodes it's easy to feel more satisfaction with victory than when a game just ends in the middle of battle in Conquest mode. The only issue isn't really with the mode but the explosive visuals when a Titan finally is destroyed. DICE really should have put some resources into making the Titan actually explode. Pieces should rain down on the landscape and fire should fall from the skies. What they have now just isn't satisfying enough to our inner pyro.    The other large change to the gameplay is the way that unlocks work. Now, instead of simply unlocking a few weapons from time to time after playing for a while, gamers will have to unlock a whole cadre of items and weapons. I was a bit unsure of the process at first. Beginners are at a disadvantage in normal games with unlocks. Unlocks like longer sprint and faster sprint recovery can really make a big difference to the way the game plays. Thankfully beginners can try to find rank restricted games to cut their teeth, but getting into a game where grenades are being lobbed around and some of the fancier gadgets are employed when you yourself don't have any can be frustrating.    On the positive side, unlocks are gathered much quicker than they are in Battlefield 2. Decent players will be able to unlock an entire class of items and weapons before too long. The best part about these items (which would have been the case even if they were standard equipment) is that many of them inspire team play even more. Those on squads will get benefits of all of the class helmets when a player has unlocked them. For example, this means the information about the class of an enemy soldier is transmitted from an assault class soldier's helmet to the rest of the squad. Other unlocks are designed for squad leaders. For example, leaders can drop spawn beacons on the ground so players can drop down into an area where they don't have control. Squad leaders can also access drones that both identify and track enemy targets but also attack them. The use of these unlocks is entirely dependant on the number of members in a squad. The advantage is big for both the squad leader and the members so it's a good idea to lock onto a bigger squad and support each other.   My main issue with the unlock system at this point is that if you really want to be successful as one class, you'll need to pour a lot of unlock points into one of them. That means the rest of the classes get no attention so switching over to other classes can be frustrating. Eventually the pace of pushing through ranks slows down so it'll take a good while to unlock more than a couple of items in each of the classes, especially advanced weaponry at the top of each class unlock tree.    Players will also find that their choices of base classes are smaller than before, but each of the classes has a number of options to serve different purposes. It's actually a pretty successful transition and also seems to make team play a little tighter as now a three or four man team can function just as effectively as a larger team, which wasn't necessarily true in Battlefield 2. It's definitely helpful to make smaller games more exciting.   One of the major issues for any Battlefield game is the number of bugs associated with a launch. Battlefield 2142 is not without it's share of these. The most notable of bugs is in the stat tracking. At this point I've received a bunch of medals and awards in a match that never actually showed up in the stat tracker. There have been several points where the game has failed to reward me with a new unlock in a timely manner after the correct point total has been reached and even on ranked servers there have been times when it's been like I haven't played at all. The other major bug has been connectivity issues. The issues I was having at the time of my first impressions have dissolved. In fact, lag and connection issues have not been a concern at all over the last week except on Monday. Outside of regular connection issues, many are having problems with Punkbuster. I've only been kicked once at this point, but others are reporting being kicked even after updating Punkbuster. These issues are sure to be resolved, it's just a matter of how quickly. Fast is not something that DICE and EA generally do.    Players will be able to see notices about known issues in the menu system at the bottom of the screen in the news ticker, which is a welcome addition. Patch notices and community updates will be displayed there so players don't have to constantly wonder about the state of affairs (though I'm sure there'll still be some wondering involved). This one feature is just a small portion of a much improved interface from that of Battlefield 2 when it was launched, even if it still has a strange loading time. Friends, favorites, and advanced searches have all worked properly this time around. There's even a server history now so that it's easy to find that server from the night before that wasn't full of a bunch of jerkwads if you forgot to add it as a favorite.    Finally, the big hubbub in the last week has been all about the in-game advertising. The topic is going to heat up over the next couple of years as more and more publishers jump on this bandwagon to make a bit of extra cash. It's aggravating that it's come to this. Part of the reason gamers log into games and play is to escape the reality of life, which includes the constant bombardment of advertising. Considering it's still a full priced game, the ads are a bit much, though coming from a guy that works for a website that serves ads regardless of whether you're a subscriber or not, I'm not sure we as a company have much ground to stand and complain. As consumers, we can bitch just as loud as the next guy. In the case of Battlefield 2142, the ads aren't really that big a problem. If you're paying attention to the action and not running around looking for ads, you're probably not even going to notice any. I certainly haven't.   The bigger concern for many people has been the little slip of paper inside the box stating that anyone playing Battlefield 2142 online will have to deal with the advertisement software sending information to the mothership. The word from EA is that the software never looks at anything outside of the game or grabs personal information. You can read the statement here. You'll have to decide for yourself how important an issue this is to you and your computer use. It doesn't seem to affect gameplay (at least after a week of playing on live servers) in the slightest and does not run without the game, so unless you're adamant about total and complete privacy, it shouldn't be a problem.    Overall Battlefield 2142, even with the look and feel of a well polished mod, is a pretty worthy addition to the franchise, even with the price tag. There's something missing that's hard to really figure out. Some of the Battlefield magic just isn't quite there. That's not to say there isn't fun to be had, it's just almost like the game is taking itself too seriously. That said, the addition of Titan mode is certainly welcome to those of us that were clamoring for objective-based play. The changes to unlocks are definitely interesting and come out looking better after a longer time playing the game thanks to quicker progression through the ranks. Now they just need to get the stat reporting to work correctly and players can have more fun playing with their new gadgets. Most importantly, team play has been preserved and even made more advantageous. Hopefully it will inspire players to join squads, get mic'd up, and work together as a team. Battlefield 2142 might not be extraordinary, but it still got excitement and fun.", "date": "Oct 21, 2006"}
