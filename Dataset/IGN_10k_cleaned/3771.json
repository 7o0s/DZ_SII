And whatever you may think of our writing skills, we've definitely got a lot of readers here on staff at IGN. And the smelliest dead horse of all at the IGN book club meetings is wondering when George Martin's coming out with the next installment in the Game of Thrones series. Seven years in, Martin's managed to make most of us believe in epic fantasy again, despite the fact that his series is currently only halfway complete.  I bring this up because I think MMO gamers are a lot like readers of epic fantasy. When you pick up the latest novel by Robert Jordan or Tad Williams, you have to know you're in for the long haul. Fans of these doorstop-sized fantasy series, often published in ever-lengthening installments at wider and wider intervals, have to be patient, hoping that the smaller individual payoffs are sufficient to keep the interest level up.  So it is with almost every MMO on the market. As a genre it embodies the ideas of long-term investment and delayed gratification. The rewards here are those you find yourself. Luckily there's plenty of content to be found in the starting areas of the game. Once you start to venture further from your starting point, you'll find that the content is harder to find. We've already covered a lot of the game in our initial previews and our recent first impressions article. But believe it or not, there's still plenty more to be said about this game.  The use of the Star Wars license is easily the most impressive aspect of the game. The worlds and environments here are instantly recognizable to any one who's seen the films. (Believe it or not, we actually do know a guy who's never seen any of them. He's from Ireland.) The locations and characters are all handled almost perfectly, from the golden, gothic architecture of Theed to the vast dunes of Tatooine. Some of the monsters pull double duty on multiple planets. There's a version of the mynock almost anywhere you go and some scary red tauntauns on Tatooine. Small power droids race through the halls of the starports while bizarre aliens carry on conversations in dim cantinas. Although my early progress went at a rapid pace, things soon slow down to a crawl. Grabbing the first two levels of any profession is relatively easy; grabbing the final two is a laborious exercise in patience and persistence. The steep curve in experience is definitely a turn off as it places the rewards for adventuring at too great a remove from each other towards the higher levels. Play for a week and you'll probably have ten new skills to play with. Play for another week and you'll barely make a dent in some of the higher-level skills you're currently training for.  Even at early stages you'll spend tons of time doing the same thing over and over again, leaving you susceptible to the mental equivalent of repetitive stress disorder. Medics and entertainers are particularly subject to this problem. I'm not convinced that those careers are particularly entertaining and it's not yet clear how the elite professions you can reach by following those paths have much more to offer. Anything that gets you out of the cantinas and hospitals has to be an improvement. Thankfully, you can take on multiple professions at once and balance your time in the hospitals with some time in the field.  Thankfully combat is a bit more dynamic, at least once you start to get the hang of things. For the most part, the non-ranged enemies will simply run at you in a straight line. Those who can attack at range will find the optimum distance for their weapon. What makes combat more than a simple ~click and watch~ affair are the special abilities. As you gain new skills, you'll gain new attack moves that you can throw into combat. Queuing up moves is relatively easy (moreso than removing them from the queue) and definitely makes combat a bit more sophisticated.  Though the combat is relatively engaging, if this is my saga it's no wonder they made a movie about those other guys -- mine isn't nearly as interesting. Somehow lying in the grass shooting space bunnies doesn't quite compare to cutting out of jedi training to rescue your friend who's been chased down by a bounty hunter. Also, my dad doesn't seem to be some big intergalactic bad ass. At least not in the game, my real dad is a pretty mean dude, just on a more local level.  The Star Wars universe handles player death in a manner consistent with the franchise. Players can bind themselves to cloning facilities on each planet. Once you die, you'll reappear at the cloning facility you paid to be resurrected at. If you don't like the idea of tracking down your corpse so you can get your stuff back, you can pay to insure items and they'll be placed in your inventory once you appear at the cloning facility. But death isn't always the outcome of a lost battle. Many enemies are simply content to let you lie incapacitated without delivering the killing blow. As a result characters in Star Wars Galaxies seem to go for longer periods without being killed. And that's a plus.  Death is a very near reality once you start trying to take on the Rebel versus Imperial portions of the game. Although I quite like the fact that the player is left to find this portion of the game on their own, a bit more direction in the actual point of doing so would be very welcome. Though you can work for either side in the war (and work as a covert or overt operative), there's not much content geared towards bringing Rebels and Imperials together in combat. Members of one faction are free to kill those of the other if they run across each other and there are some intriguing team-based player-versus-player areas where you can start to get more of a sense that this is truly a Civil War.  The game is simply gorgeous. I'm very impressed that the team was able to render each planet so uniquely. Each world seems completely different from the others while still maintaining an artistic consistency that lets you know you're still in the same game. Character models are very lifelike and the animations help to add an extra touch or realism to the game. The combat graphics are great. Laser fire kicks up smoke when it hits and gives off a bright flash that's really compelling   Naturally there are things I'd like to see improved. The draw-in is a bit too noticeable on planets that have lots of flat areas and low-lying foliage. And while the land rolls around you, the idea of real 3D terrain doesn't factor in to the combat really other than affecting ranges. Though there are no true load times in Galaxies (excepting those that occur as you take shuttle flights to different cities or planets), you will find that the game tends to chop and stutter a bit in the cities, particularly when you're entering buildings.   John Williams's score is recycled ad nauseam in the game and, while it too gets a bit repetitive, I think it's good enough to stand up to multiple hearings. It's not as if the score plays throughout. In fact, some sequences of the game seem quiet...a little too quiet. But this only helps punch up the effect of the music as you enter combat or find yourself coming upon some of the locations in the game. The cantina music could use a bit more variety but that's merely because a lot of the musicians in the game aren't experienced enough to play anything other than one basic song.      The rest of the game's sound palette uses material from the movies. The screech of blasters and the grunts of your enemies are well done. More impressive are the sounds of TIE Fighters and shuttles passing by overhead. Hearing that scream in the skies above me got me excited about the team's plans to include space vehicles in their next expansion.  Speaking of expansions...MMO games are something of a moving target in terms of reviews. Though it involves a bit of speculation, it's important to discuss where we think the title is heading. The first issue for the team is client and server stability. Currently clusters and subservers are fairly reliable. The small problems that arise with subservers are usually fixed fairly quickly but can still knock a few players out of the game. On the rare instances where something's wrong with an entire cluster, more players are affected and more work is required to get things running smoothly again.   Once the team is sure of the technical stability of the title (which they seem to be more and more), it'll be time to focus on adding more content. According to the general schedule outlined for us, the first big feature to be added is player-run cities and towns. After that the team will likely spend time finalizing player-owned vehicles. Since player mounts is a stepping-stone to player vehicles, you'll likely get your tauntauns before you get your landspeeders.  A number of smaller changes are also in store for the game including better sort functions at the bazaar, profession-specific mission terminals. More boss monsters and dungeon-like environments are also on tap for inclusion. Going back over my notes for the review, I can instantly tell that a lot of progress has been made in numerous other areas. Creatures and ground objects no longer float mysteriously in the air. Missions that were broken or missing altogether are now in place and functioning properly.", "date": "Jul 12, 2003"}
