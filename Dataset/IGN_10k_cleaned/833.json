{"name": "Command & Conquer", "name_review": "Command & Conquer", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/04/01/command-conquer", "text": "Once exclusive to PC users, Command & Conquer is now available for console owners. Oh, happy day! In addition to the original 45 missions, Westwood has also added the ~Covert Operations~ missions and five specially designed missions available only for the PlayStation.  The game begins right when you turn on your PlayStation. What starts out as an everyday channel-surf through your television slowly changes to an intro that subliminally says, ~Earth will die by the hand of NOD.~ Scary? As a countermeasure, the UN launches team GDI (Global Defense Initiative). From there you can choose between two scenarios, either playing as the cool and evil NOD or being the not so cool (but good) GDI. It's kind of like choosing between Cobra or G.I. Joe. You either have the coolest ships and promote world terrorism or you can just be the good guys.   Graphically, the PlayStation version of Command and Conquer looks just like the PC version. The cut scenes, the map scenarios, the kick-ass sound track - it's all there and then some. Unfortunately, there's no mouse support. Be prepared for some severe cases of arthritis in the fingers. Doh! On the other hand, pain is a small price to pay to play the best real-time war strategy of all-time without pumping out thousands of dollars for a PC. The only real problem is that it's not two-player. That's what made C&C so popular in the first place.   Still, even in one player mode this game is enjoyable and will definitely keep you busy until something better comes out. Red Alert perhaps? We'll see.", "date": "Apr 1, 1997"}
