Fatal Fury, World Heroes, Magician Lord  all notable titles, but selecting those earliest games to represent the Neo brand is doing it something of a disservice, since the hardware produced much more stunning experiences later in its life.    Well, Blue's Journey continues the trend. Though by no means a bad game, this quaint and quirky platformer still doesn't truly display what the Neo Geo could do. It looks more like a title that you'd find running on the Game Boy Advance, and it's hard to recommend investing 900 Wii Points in a game like that.   The portable comparison might be apt, as well, considering Blue's theme and environment. He's a miniature hero living in an oversized world, a guy who looks like a human being but dresses himself like a bug. The story finds that it's up to little boy Blue to save his fellow insect-costumed compatriots from the imminent encroachment of pollution, and he's equipped for the job with the powers of nature.   Blue gets it done by dumping leaves. That's right.  Meaning, leaves. Simple green tree leaves function as your primary attack while controlling Blue, and any enemies hit by the leaves are forcibly flipped upside-down. Then, running to touch them, you can pick them up as in Super Mario Bros. 2, and use them as projectiles to assault other foes.   It's a fine mechanic that works fairly well, though the range of your initial ~leaf dump~ (as it's called) is a bit lacking, and dealing with multiple incoming adversaries at once can be troublesome. And because Blue's was designed with the arcade in mind, as with other Neo Geo games, you'll find that troublesome situations often lead to quick and unfortunate death. Blue can only take two hits initially before it's time to re-spawn, though you can upgrade his abilities through items purchased at shops.   Leaves and leaping isn't all there is to see, as Blue can also shrink himself to fit into small places, duck into mid-stage rest stops like the homes of non-player characters and choose multiple paths to take to advance through the adventure, but overall it plays out how you'd expect it to. There's a two-player co-op mode that lets a second player jump in as Blue's green-colored friend, which is a nice addition  it's good to have another simultaneous-play selection available in the Wii Shop for those that have enjoyed past co-op adventures like Gunstar Heroes and Super C. Is it enough to make Blue's Journey worth its total asking price though? Not really.Because it's still just a passable platformer in the end, and for the increased pricetag of 900 Wii Points charged for Neo Geo titles on the VC, you should be getting more than just something passable. If you want platformers, even co-op ones, there are already several other, cheaper options to be found and enjoyed in the Shop. If you want a game with cute, colorful graphics, there are plenty of those to be had as well. And if you want a game where the hero dresses up like an insect, Mario and his new bumblebee suit say hello. So there's little truly fresh content to be found in this download, and the wait will continue for a really excellent, immediately recommendable Neo Geo title to find its way to the Virtual Console. Maybe if we're lucky, we'll get a true classic before the end of the year.", "date": "Nov 22, 2007"}
