KI            Gold hits home on Nintendo 64 with            solid, intact combo-intensive            gameplay, music, and interactive            backgrounds that'll make KI Gold fans            happy. All the popular characters are            back from KI 2, with some hidden            ones thrown in for good measure.             Game control is fluid, but the N64            joypad does require some getting used            to. The game uses the same six-button            system as Street Fighter II, with three            buttons dedicated to punches and the            others for kick attacks, but that is            essentially where the similarity ends.            Whereas SF emphasizes skill,            patience, and a mastery over the            controls, Killer Instinct seems to favor            the aggressive, chaotic button pushing            techniques found in the Mortal Kombat            series. KI had the potential to be a deep            fighting game, but the depth is clouded            by the archaic fighting system which            relies far too heavily on combo            memorization and pre-planning than it            does on inventive, spontaneous            gameplay.  Drawing you into the heated battles is a            vastly improved camera which            automatically zooms in and out of the            action, adjusting for the best possible            viewing angle. This seems to be one of            the rare instances where the camera            adds to the gameplay instead of            hindering it.             As far as conversions go, KI Gold is            superior but not perfect. All the            characters and combos from KI 2 are            here, running at a good frame rate,            with the backgrounds updating at 60            fps. But due to the limitations of the            cartridge format, some frames of            animation have been left out, as well as            all the FMV sequences, but overall that            doesn't detract from the gameplay. The            backgrounds have been wonderfully            ported over from the arcade version,            and have even been refined to increase            the detail levels and the colors. The            soundtrack is fully intact, and now            seems even better with cleaner sound            effects and music.   Nintendo has even gone and improved            upon the practice mode, enabling gamers to            work on specific areas of their fighting            game. Want to perfect a counter move or            combo breaker? No problem. Just follow            the appropriate tutorial, and you have the            chance to get better. Other options include            team and tournament modes which enable            gamers to compete against each other using            their favorite group of characters.In the final analysis, Nintendo 64 users desperate for a fighting game will probably snatch this game up, but the title is showing signs of age from its extended stay in the arcades. If you're a fan of Killer Instinct, you won't be disappointed, but KI Gold really can't be considered in the upper echelon of next-generation fighting games.", "date": "Dec 5, 1996"}
