With all of the twists in storylines and changes in affiliation within the different wrestling promotions, the videogame is always going to be weeks if not months behind its television counterpart. Since accuracy goes immediately out the window, the successful game has to have some fantastic gameplay or other cool gimmicks to get players interested and coming back for more. For WCW Mayhem, Electronic Arts put in a great playing engine and darn near all of the trappings of WCW wrestling from the jobbers to the Jackhammers. While there are some problems with the game's look, there's enough substance to Mayhem to make most forget that this is EA's first wrestling title. Because this is a new genre title, we hope you appreciate the comments from associate producer Mr. Gary Lam included in this review.  Features  More than 60 WCW wrestlers featured in game. Intuitive controls that are easy to learn, yet hard to master. Dynamic in-game camera system that will provide excellent camera angles for all of the action in and out of the ring. Over 600 motion captured animations that provide every WCW wrestler with a unique set of moves, including signature taunts and finishing moves. Impressive ring entrances for each wrestler complete with authentic music, pyrotechnics, real-time lighting and stunning graphic effects. Fifteen WCW sets including Monday Nitro, Thunder, Saturday Night, a well as all 12 WCW Pay Per View settings. Momentum meter that provides a clear indication of what direction the match is going. Crowd reactions that chant, cheer or boo according to how the match is going.  No monotonous crowd loops. Proprietary EA technology that brings most extensive range of facial animations/expressions capable on N64. Rumble Pak compatible. Multiplayer support.   Gameplay Speed is the name of the game and Mayhem has plenty of it. Simpler character models have allowed developer Kodiak to keep the wrestlers moving at believable speeds. Running into a turnbuckle is quick and dynamic rather than slow, plodding and predictable. With the characters moving so fluidly, Mayhem then makes sure you get the most out of this speed by jamming it full of action. The out of ring battle and WCW authenticity are two features that set this game apart.  The wrestling control itself is intuitive using the D-pad instead of the control stick. With the four directions on the D-pad and the four attack buttons used for grappling moves, you'd think every wrestler would have at least 16moves at their disposal. However with so much duplication of controls (D-up and B gives you the same maneuver as D-left and C-down) each guy will only have nine moves total and not all of those are cool. We recommend avoiding most of the cruiserweights because it seems like half of all their moves are pins and submissions that are no good early in a match. Goldberg and Scott Steiner are fine choices for instant ass whooping.  If you're not sure about battling outside of the ring, Mayhem does all it can to make sure you get used to it. The default match rules are set up for no count outs and pins count anywhere. One of the few parts of the game that will have you twiddling your thumbs is when you actually have to wait for your wrestler to get out of the ring or head backstage to continue the action. When you do though there's plenty of weapons and crowd reactions to go along with it.     Gary Lam:Once we had the idea of backstage fighting, we were faced with the challenge of how, technically, we could implement this. The biggest hurdle was to ensure that we didn't require a loading time to go from the main ring to the backstage area. That would have ruined the illusion of  continuing the action from one location to another. Again, our programmers used some creativity and managed to be very smart with how they used their RAM. Because of this, we got the desired results.     Going backstage is actually a great way to gain an advantage provided there's some cool weapons back there somewhere. By cool weapons we mean the all powerful cattle prod. The same one that cost Goldberg is unbeaten streak last December. This electronic device deals out four times the normal damage of your conventional bludgeon weapons like chairs and sticks. Any opponent that you take backstage should get a nice dose of electricity before you go for the win. This is especially useful as you advance through the Quest for the Best career modes since the opponents get tougher and tougher.  The out of the ring action is a great new feature that should see its way into future wrestling games, but it's cool for one reason and one reason only. The punishment. You can still use conventional moves and punches just like in the ring, but only the most conservative gamers would opt for that. With all of those tasty weapons waiting for you around the ring and especially backstage, the out of ring battle usually boils down to who can get to the best weapons first. While we mentioned the awesome power of the cattle prod, but the kitchen sink is our sentimental favorite because of its symbolism and 2X damage. The thing in Mayhem is that you can only use the weapon of choice a limited number of times before your opponent will automatically reverse the move, bash you, and make you lose the thing.   Every once in awhile, there will be a run-in during the match that, for the most part, fall along the proper lines of affiliation. If you beat up on Chavo Guerror Jr. too much, Eddie Guerrero comes out to help his nephew. However, there are times when you'll get some run-ins that reflect some rather strange alliances. The one we have in mind, wasn't even a run-in but rather a surprise attack. We used Goldberg once against Sting and decided to take the match out back to give the Stinger a little taste of the kitchen sink. When we get back there, lo and behold Kevin Nash is there ready to whoop ass. Much to our surprise, Nash jumped on Sting and joined us in our beatdown. Now on a real Monday Nitro show this would be the beginning of a great angle or new story line. Unfortunately in videogames there's something lost when the wrestlers can't actually talk and brag to back up the story lines. However, if we can't hear the storylines the next best thing is to play them out and Mayhem gives us plenty of opportunity to do just that.  Attention to detail is very strong part of Mayhem. EA put out a lot of effort to bring as much of that WCW experience home and put it into this cartridge. While you can say what you want about the federation itself and its stars, there are few wrestling games that have brought the total experience of wrestling promotion home like this.     GL: WCW has been a great organization to work with. Honestly, everyone from the top executives to the crew were very co-operative and excited about helping us with our first wrestling title. Of course, it didn't start out as smoothly. We had to establish a completely new relationship with WCW as well as garner their trust in our production staff. This meant traveling to a fair amount of live events to photograph talent, record audio, and to get a better understanding of what goes into creating a wrestling show. I think the only real difficulty in working with WCW was scheduling. WCW does 52 live Monday Nitros each year in addition to all of the TV tapings, house shows, and Pay Per View events. We learned in a hurry that you have to be somewhat flexible in order to have the proper talent available for things like motion capture shoots, voice recordings, etc. In the end, it all worked out.....thankfully.     As good as the WCW detail is there are some things about Mayhem that can be a bit frustrating. Wrestlers change outfits as often as the change allegiances and unfortunately you'll be stuck with the default outfit for each wrestler. You can for example use the Wolfpac Sting with the red outfit and face paint, but rather than just toggling on this outfit, you have to unlock the Wolfpac Sting in the Quest for the Best career mode. This goes for other wrestlers as well. If you want to put Hollywood ~Hulk~ Hogan into his retro yellow outfit instead of his default NWO outfit, you'd have to do so in the Create-a-Wrestler mode. This would be great if you could import Hogan into that mode and just tinker with his appearance, but this is not the case. You have to build a Hogan lookalike and give him the outfit you want him to have. Again this would be tolerable as well if the Create-a-Wrestler had a little more depth.  Creating a wrestler is tough because your options are so limited. You get a choice of three body types equivalent to small, medium and large and a choice of ten basic character templates to work with. These templates are basically pre-rendered characters with personas like Diablo and The Wasp that you can then further alter.  You end up macro managing your wrestler's physical appearance by choosing entire faces and body shapes. However when it comes to superficial details like clothing and tattoos and such, you can really let your creative juices flow. You can choose to specify the type of head piercing, what kind of neck tattoo, which pants leg will have a hole in it and type of necktie your guy will have. It's not nearly as comprehensive as WWF Attiude's wrestler creation, but Mayhem fortunately put its strengths elsewhere in the game and it's worth it.  Sound The importance of sound can't be understated and in Mayhem you're getting probably the best audio of any wrestling game to come out this year. It starts with the announcing samples of Tony Schiavone and Mean Gene Okerlund. Schiavone is running his mouth throughout the duration of the match, just like he does on TV, but it all works because his speech is varied and very timely. When you stop wrestling and start your taunting, he'll complain that there's ~too much taunting and not enough wrestling.~ If you pick up a weapon and proceed to wreck shop, Schiavone will nearly wet himself because of the excessive violence that you're dishing out. For the uninitiated wrestling fan (who would by this game that wasn't into wrestling?), he even names some of the more conventional moves as you apply them to your opponent. Very good stuff. Mean Gene only introduces the match and announces the winner but he tells you the name of the event in true broadcast style, the rules of the match and the names of the competitors. No game this season has this.    GL: We have some of the best audio people in the industry working at EA and because of that, we benefit from all of the proprietary technology that has been developed over the past couple of years. It also helped greatly that our audio lead talent has done a lot of N64 product in the past and knows how to squeeze the most out of a 16 MB cartridge.     Even though you can adjust the individual volumes for the crowd, the music and the announcer, it seems that we can never get the music loud enough for our tastes without sacrificing in one of the other areas. Anyone who watches Nitro knows that they pump the music up loud and that makes the crowd even louder, but the balance still works to keep the energy going. In Mayhem we've turned the music volume way up, everything else way down and then turned up the TV volume, but we still didn't get that tingly feeling we usually get when Booker T's music starts up before a match. Maybe it would've been better if the crowd starts of quiet, the music hits and plays long enough for you to recognize and then the crowd goes wild.  Graphics We've already told you that there's no problem with framerate or fluidity, but that doesn't mean all is peachy keen. The excellent motion captured athletes make for some great wrestling moves but the guys can look a little strange when standing still. Even in the selection screen the guys stand there with their hands in front of their bodies and wrists held in such a way that they look like kangaroos. While we love marsupials as much as anyone else that's not what you want your kick ass wrestler to look like. The crazy wrist positioning seems to be intentional and included perhaps to make the wrestling moves look more accurate when they grab and wrap each other up.   Lash Leroux (he usually appears early in whatever program he happens to be in) was the talent for a lot of motion capturing sessions and he told us that the most difficult move to do for the game was the belly to belly suplex. Not because it's a tough move to do requiring speed and power, but because the mo-cap suits are made of velcro and would stick to each other when the guys were up close and personal. In spite of this, the belly to belly suplex looks great as do most of the other moves. There are a few problems with clipping and collision detection so that a guy may not get his arm completely around the other fellow or a punch may not exactly connect (maybe this game is more accurate than we thought!) and it can really get to you sometimes.  One way you can tell EA is proud of their mo-capped animations is when the camera moves in close during a special move. The camera hops around throughout the match, usually in a way that gives you the best shot of the action and really doesn't irritate you. However, when DDP sets up the Diamon Cutter, there's nothing like getting that nice low angle shot from ringside that shows off the devastating impact. Very cool. My first encounter with Mayhem left me with a very bad impression. The motion capped moves seemed to suck and the controls were atrocious. So you can imagine how delightfully surprised I was when we got a near complete version of the game that flew like the wind and sounded like the TV shows. Seeing this game develop every step of the way may give me a certain perspective, but I don't think there will be a faster, smoother wrestling game available this season. Likewise no game has the quality of announcing that Mayhem has. These two major pluses outweigh the biggest minuses to Mayhem, the kangaroo wrist thing and the lackluster create-a-player mode. It all comes down to gameplay and Mayhem has got it. WCW may be trailing in TV ratings, but this game is flat out fun and will satisfy your urge to whoop lots of ass.Are you a dedicated wrestling fan?
