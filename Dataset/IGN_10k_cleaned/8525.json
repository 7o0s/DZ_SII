EA Mobile updates the gem-swapping classic again for mobile, flashing it up with sharp animations, improved music and sound effects, and a variety of game play options for enhanced gaming.  What's more, unlike its recent Scrabble port, EA installed a robust online component for network play.  (Why they would put one in Bejeweled and not Scrabble is a mystery for the ages.) The inclusion of this more-than-competent online mode is reason enough to trade up if you already have an older version of Bejeweled on your handset, such as the original multiplayer Bejeweled from JAMDAT.   The concept behind Bejeweled is simplicity itself: an eight-by-eight grid full of multicolored gems of varying shapes.  Align three or more of the same kind and they disappear, awarding points as new gems drop in to take their place.  You must make as many matches as possible to move on to the next grid. The game control is ridiculously basic.  Just move your cursor (via the D-pad or the 2, 4, 6, and 8 keys) to the desired gem, click on it, and choose an adjacent gem with which to swap positions.  If this switch connects three or more gems, they'll disappear and you'll score points; if not, the gems will revert to their previous positions.  No harm, no foul (unless it's a timed game).   Play options include the good ol' standby Classic, the timed Action mode, or Multiplayer.  For the latter, you access a network connection to go head-to-head against a friend or random player, with your opponent's grid reduced to a small window in the bottom corner of your screen. What's more, in the Multiplayer mode, you can frustrate your former friend (soon to be bitter lifelong nemesis) by launching bombs that enable one of four different attacks guaranteed to impede his/her progress (reverse controls, etc.) and provoke fits of colorful language to horrify a boatload of sailors. Following a two-minute match, you can even gloat via a useful chat tool.   How is it possible for a human being to become so completely absorbed in such elementary gameplay?  I don't have the answers for you; I know only that my girlfriend fell asleep several times with the game in hand, unable to stop playing even as her eyelids struggled for sleep.  If I hadn't taken the thing away from her to write this review, she might not have eaten for days.   I'm not as inclined toward puzzle games as my better half, so I didn't lose sleep or miss meals to play Bejeweled.  But EA's gorgeously designed port dazzled me, and kept me switching gems for much longer than I could have imagined.  I don't recommend starting a game when you have to be somewhere anytime in the next half-hour or so.  Snazzier than earlier mobile incarnations, this Bejeweled is fast and fun.  It's hard to find flaws in a classic game that's so compelling it invades your sleep (careful: you may find yourself dreaming about multicolored jewels and unconsciously flexing your thumbs while you snooze).", "date": "May 24, 2007"}
