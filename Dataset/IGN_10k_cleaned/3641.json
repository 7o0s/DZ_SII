No Crash?  Thanks to one of Activision's earliest and greatest game makers, the Atari 2600 hosted the first real-deal side-scrolling platformer, and a genre was born.  The landmark title has now been successfully ported to your cellphone, thanks to the good ship JAMDAT.  Features: Side-scrolling action 200-plus jungle scenes MIDI sound effects   Pitfall! is still considered one of Activision's greatest triumphs.  And for good reason, as the game has held up fantastically over the last two decades.  Unless you are a true-blue graphics whore, it's impossible to not pick up the original Pitfall! and a be perfect content gamer for a good hour.  JAMDAT has managed to successfully recreate the magic.  This cellphone port contains the entire 2600 original--all 255 screens, every scorpion, every shimmering brick of gold.  And it's still quite the challenge, however, some of that can be attributed to getting used to the keypad controls.  Especially when it comes time to leap over those pesky crocodiles.  Give it time, though, and you'll be falling through pits with the best of them.  Forty minutes.  That's all the time you have to master his jungle.  There are exactly thirty-two treasures out there, waiting to be found.  The more you find, the higher your point total.  Points are subtracted, though, when you are hit by a rolling log.  No such respite, though, if you are gobbled by a croc, fall in a tar pit, or are dumb enough to touch the campfire.  And since that fire is a stationary object, you deserve to feel like a maroon for losing one of your precious three lives to it.  The game is presented in a sort of quasi-letterbox since celly screens are not quite the same shape as your old television.  The actual game happens along the top of the screen, while the bottom offers up a crib sheet for controls.  It looks exactly like the old Atari game, just scaled down for the smaller-than-small screen.  The sounds have also been faithfully recreated, including the unforgettable jungle bellow when you jump to a vine.Do yourself a favor and give Pitfall! a DL.  If you want to see what the platforming genre got started, look no further.  JAMDAT should be rewarded for this pitch-perfect port of the old Activision classic, and I am now extremely piqued to see how they handle their next Activision port: River Raid.", "date": "May 13, 2003"}
