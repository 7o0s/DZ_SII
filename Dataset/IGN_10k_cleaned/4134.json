And neither one were really anything special, both ending up better than average simply because they honestly didn't have much competition in the genre. The release of Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004, however, marks the first real, recommended game of golf on the Game Boy Advance. There's still room for improvement, but it's great to finally get our hands on a worthy links title made specifically for the GBA system. Features: Five courses Six on-screen golfers, including Tiger Woods and John Daly 12 different scenarios 20 collectable trophies Connectivity with the GameCube version Link cable support for two players Cartridge save (three player slots) Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 for the Game Boy Advance is based entirely on the GameCube, Xbox, and PS2 versions released just a month before. The portable rendition features five courses, three real (St. Andrews, TPS of Scottsdale, Bay Hill), as well as two devious fantasy courses (The Highlands and The Predator), offering the usual array of features including realistic ball physics, changing wind directions and weather, and different surface conditions that have an effect on the distance of the ball after it's hit. The GBA version features a tremendous amount of extras in its gameplay, including a career mode where they can build up their choice of on-screen persona (the game has six different rendered characters to play) by winning tournaments and spending the cash on abilities. There's also a bunch of gaming options to try: the Eagle Hunt is a real challenge since players must score two strokes under in each of the game's Par 5 holes. There's also a bunch of scripted scenarios to attempt that award trophies and much needed cash. The earned trophies and player stats can be saved to cartridge, and the game will even keep track of the last hole finished during a tournament just in case players have to abruptly switch off the system. The cash earned in the GBA game can also be moved to the GameCube version, which will unlock some super secret clothing in that version...but the connectivity won't really benefit the GBA player.  The issues with the previous two golf games released on the Game Boy Advance were generally based around the limitations of the graphics. Both of those games had gameplay restrictions because of technical limitations; both Final Round and the last Tiger Woods lacked land elevation, and Tiger Woods actually left out all the trees and objects in its only available course.  Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 on the GBA actually offers a much more realistic take on the sport, and it's all thanks to a wonderful graphics engine that can handle the drastically changing land height in the game's five different courses. Flatlands, rolling hills, even extreme cliffs are rendered accurately through a voxel engine on the GBA.  There are limitations to this engine, though, and Digital Eclipse worked the game's interface to accomodate these limitations. For example, unlike the console game players can't simply adjust their aim in the swing screen; they have to jump to an overhead view of the course and move the cursor to where they're looking to hit the ball. After this selection has been made, the game will pause to re-render the view from the first-person view, which takes about three seconds for the Game Boy Advance to calculate.   The developers worked to bring the console experience onto the handheld, and while the Total Precision (TM) style swing mechanism of the GameCube, Xbox, and PS2 versions work well with the analog stick, it's not really made for a system with only an eight direction digital pad. The Total Precision on the console removes the traditional power bar from the game, instead giving players control over their swing using the control stick. By pulling back and pushing forward on the stick, this simulates the motion of the on-screen character's swing, and by adjusting, intentionally or accidentally, the position of the stick during the back and forward swing, players can fade, draw, hook and slice the ball down the fairway. They can also adjust how much they want to swing by pulling back on the stick as much or as little as possible. This control was made specifically for the console's control, not the Game Boy's D-pad.   Still, Digital Eclipse mimicked that gameplay mechanism as well as they could on the GBA controls and, while they managed to pull out a decently controlling golf game, it would have made better sense to go with the traditional golfing control of button timing on a power-bar. It's a little too easy to shoot straight with this control scheme, since it's next to impossible to accidentally shank it during the swing unless you're attempting to pull off the fade or draw and screw up doing it. But players do have decent control over how much power to add by quickly tapping on the R shoulder button during the backswing. In the air, players can adjust the top or backspin of the ball before it hits the ground, just like the console versions. This direct control is a little more arcade-like for a golf simulation, but at least it's pick-up-and-play friendly.  Once on the green, the game moves to a strictly overhead view, cutting to a cup view when the ball creeps towards the hole. The putting game is admittedly a little on the forgiving side. Oh, sure, it's certainly possible to really botch a long putt, but the game spoonfeeds the green's read and definitely allows for wild, overpowered putts to go in. Even with its simplistic control and lax putting game, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 is still a satisfying golfing experience on the Game Boy Advance. It doesn't have much in the way of competition since the only two other GBA golf games weren't much better than the average fare. This game is a great first step in bringing the console golfing experience to the handheld, since it makes for a decent foundation for a 2005 follow-up. It will be interesting to see how well this holds up against the only other golf game on the horizon: Nintendo and Camelot's Mario Golf: Advance Tour. But as it stands, video golf fans will dig Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004.", "date": "Nov 7, 2003"}
