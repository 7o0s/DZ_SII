{"name": "Spider-Man [The Movie Game]", "name_review": "Spider-Man", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/04/17/spider-man-9", "text": "In the small world of videogames, nearly every superhero game has earned its place next to the lost and buried Atari 2600 E.T. cartridges for good reason. It's sad, but true, superhero games usually suck. Thanks to Activision and its developers, however, the Spider-Man series has risen above the drudgery of games with restrictive, dumbed-down design and poor implementation to reflect the personality and spirit of the comic books themselves.    Spider-Man, once known as Spider-Man the Movie, has shouldered its way past NeverSoft's first game as the best version of the past three, thanks to Treyarch's wisdom and vastly superior availability of technology (namely 128-bit systems), making this year's version sharper looking and better playing and bigger in scope than either of the other two versions.   Cameras  ~With great power comes great responsibility,~ is the chosen mantra of the latest Spider-Man movie, which also happens to fit nicely into the theme of this version, too. The longtime Activision developer has earned its stripes with Spider-Man by enhancing nearly every aspect of the Webhead's game design, adding important elements such as a different reward system, air combat, a slew of new moves, and more control over what is surely one of the trickiest superheroes to re-create in a videogame.    The problems Treyarch faced when designing Spider-Man for next-generation systems were multiple. And at least from where I sit, the big hit-list of problems to solve included the ever-nagging camera dilemmas, more precise control, and fresh level design. I would say the designers succeeded in achieving two out the three. Depending on how you look at it, perhaps only two of them are solvable.   After seeing developers deal with 3D camera systems for nearly seven years now, the cameras in Spider-Man surely present the most difficult of any game. This superhero walks on ceilings, clings to walls, pointy air vents, corners, frickin' everything, and the camera has to instantly respond and present the best angle for players to see and feel like they're controlling the game. It's always hard, but in this case it's extra hard.    New to the series is a slightly more advanced Spider-Man camera. On the ground, the camera follows Spider-Man from a third-person perspective, but when Spider-Man climbs walls, or turns around in a narrow hallway, the camera enables the Webhead to face into the camera, or it tries to find the best angle to see him. Unlike in previous Spidey games, the camera here isn't fixed against enemies or focused on the enemy. Somewhat like the Devil May Cry camera, this fluid camera permits gamers to continue pushing the left analog button in the direction Spider-Man was facing before the camera switched, and then switches back without altering gameplay. It's clever, and it works, mostly.    But there are camera issues on the ground. The biggest camera problem causes gamers to lose their direction. Sometimes, when in a boss fight that requires speed and instant knowledge of the enemy's whereabouts, the camera, which is purposely slow to make the switch, is too slow. Gamers can manually switch the camera with the right analog stick, but then they end up chasing Spider-Man with the camera, and it becomes downright frustrating. This appears in ground fights. With ground combat the camera grows annoying, though. When fighting Green Goblin, he always seems to have the upper hand, chucking guided bombs at you, while you're clinging to some wall, probably crawling sideways instead of up, and simply trying to orient yourself. These are the moments when the cameras can be a problem.   The air combat cameras are relatively flawless. Treyarch implements an excellent roving target cam, which keeps the enemy in view, and usually guides players into combat. Players can switch it on or off with the click of a shoulder button. This makes fighting in air very good indeed, and once again makes players feel like they are truly controlling Spider-Man like in the comics.    Overall, if players grow skilled in Spider-Man's abilities, the camera really isn't too much of a deterrent; it's more of an irritating nag, like a little brother or a mosquito bite. You'll live, but it's a pain. But then, again, what game truly delivers the perfect 3D camera? (The answer is none.) Honestly, Spider-Man is so nimble and possesses so many abilities that the camera work may never be perfect in this series, so given the obstacles in front of it Treyarch has done a good job.       Controls and Gameplay  When it comes to controlling Spider-Man, while his abilities have increased with new land and air moves, the changes aren't overly dramatic. They're slight changes and additions that either increase the game's breadth or make it more manageable to play, which you would expect from the third in the series. Don't get me wrong, they're all good, but it's not like Spider-Man is a revolutionary game.    Spider-Man still contains the basic problems from the first two games, but they're easier to deal with, because they have been handled better. For instance, remember how Spider-Man could only face in about eight different directions before? All gone. He's free, mobile, and completely controllable. Remember the annoyingly restrictive web slinging? Or falling because you dipped too low while swinging? Gone.    One of the coolest aspects of this new Spider-Man is that the air controls create a huge um, spider web of options. Heh. Spidey can cut webbing and switch directions instantly. He can drop through the air for like 20-30 stories in a pure freefall just for fun, and then at the last second, starting swinging again. It's all damn good! He can spin in mid-air and change direction, summersault and do it all again, no sweat.    Other new cool moves include the zip-line. You could zip-line in Spider-Man on PS, but not like this. By pressing L1 and aiming the left analog, players can quickly zip from one side of the room to another, eliminating walking or jumping, which takes longer and is b-o-r-i-n-g. This is zippy. Players can zip-line up the sides of buildings, too, which is very useful. Spider-Man contains several moves that are also exceptionally neat, but they're hardly useful.  He can hang from a web, and descend into an area secretly, and he can crawl, too, but it's not like you'll use these more for even 1% of the game.   Spider-Man has the ability to grab as many as 28 kinds of combo attacks, be they straight fighting moves or web-based attacks. Old moves are still there such as the web yank, impact web, and web gloves, but newer moves, such as scissor kick and the tackle have been newly added. The string of aerial moves also makes things more interesting, while other combo attacks include some acrobatic and wrestling style moves.    The full list of combo moves includes: Dual Fists, Field Goal, Gravity Slam, Web Hit, Backflip Kick, Sting, Palm, High Web Hit, Dive Bomb, Head Hammer, Dive Kick, Web Gloves, Adv. Web Gloves, Web Yank, Mule Kick, Uppercut, Flip Mule, Low Web Hit, Elbow Slam, Scissor Kick, High Stomp, Tackle, Handspring, Haymaker, Web Dome, Adv. Web Dome, Impact Web, and Adv. Impact Web. All can be found in the option menu.   What's best about the combo moves is that they're based on a reward system encouraging exploration and replaying levels. Combo moves are represented as gold spider icons which Spider-Man picks up. Many are easy to find, while others are hidden. Some are hidden on building tops, others appear at the end of a corridor, and others are one-time shots, as they float down a sewage path (yes, I found that one). You won't find all of them the first time through, which is nice.    The point system is different than the previous Spider-Man games (which were based on finding comic books) in that it scores your performance, divvying out points at the level's end. In some levels players are rewarded for fighting style -- variety of moves and success rate -- while others are based on timeliness or your ability to avoid taking damage. Players are rewarded with special costumes (there are a bunch, including playing through the game in Peter Parker's wrestling outfit, as Peter Parker, Alex Ross's version of the costume, etc.), special CG footage, and a hilarious ~pinhead bowling~ mini-game. And players are encouraged to beat the game on all four difficulty settings, with rewards for each. One nice extra is that once you've beaten the game, each level is then permanently opened to revisit at any time to increase your score.    The hardest aspects of controlling Spidey are once again tied into the camera angles. When you're fighting a villain and Spider-Man is crawling from once surface face to another, he's most vulnerable and most difficult to control. For instance, when fighting the Green Goblin in the level after saving Mary Jane, you have to rescue civilians from broken buildings. You must land and then web them back together while avoiding Green Goblin's attacks. If you miss the landing spot, and hit a corner or side panel, it takes time and usually you'll take a good amount of punishment to re-orient yourself. Sometimes, it's just better to jump off and try again.    The other control issue that is simply hard to reckon with is the double-edged sword that is Spider-Man. He clings to everything. That's a great ability. It's his special ability. But hey, when I'm fighting Green Goblin or some robot that takes five hits, and I jump away from him to re-orient myself and then stick to a wall by accident -- because I simply touched it -- I'm not feeling in control. I'm frustrated. Is that an issue that can be solved? I don't know, but it happens in Spider-Man a lot, and it's not amusing.   As for being the best in the series, the only way in which I feel that this version loses out to the original is in its lack of character variety. The first was jam-packed with enemies and allies! Black Cat, Punisher, Captain America, Daredevil, Rhino, Mysterio, Dr. Octopus, Venom, Scorpion, Carnage, heck, even the Lizard was there. Here, you do get to confront more enemies than in you'll see in the movie, but the distinct lack of enemies and allies is slightly disappointing. The new characters you'll fight are the Vulture and Norman Osborne as the Green Goblin, while Shocker and Scorpion make their comebacks, too.    This version is also by far more widespread in level design. Players will notice the wonderful return of web-swinging chase levels, which are far more interesting and compelling than ever before due to the great air combat system and larger levels. There are standard boss fights with each of the listed enemies, and there are straightforward switch-pulling action levels. Surprisingly, the Shocker chase levels, especially, the train section, was quite fun. Adding into the chase levels is the requirement to fix items the Vulture or Green Goblin have destroyed, which is cool.    A few levels, however, stand out as exceptionally good. Race Against Time is the classic Green Goblin dilemma, excellently implemented here. Spider-Man must choose between chasing down the Goblin or finding hidden bombs and saving innocent civilians. It's the stuff of comic book greatness. In fact, several of the Goblin levels are great, especially Face-off at the Bridge.    In another couple of levels Treyarch has implemented key uses of Spider-man's moves, which is applauded. In Chemical Chaos and Breaking and Entering, players must be sneaky, and like the first Spider-Man, in which Spidey had to rescue civilians stealthily, these levels force gamers into using stealth. In one part of Chemical Chaos, gamers have to sneak past dozens of trip wires, and the use of the R3 button and zip line are highly effective. The Vulture's Lair and Oscorp's Ultimate Weapon are the most difficult and the most cheap, too, and they aren't terribly inventive, but man, will you feel relieved after having finished them!       PS2 vs. GameCube vs. Xbox  I'm pretty sure I'll be saying this again in the future, but for this multi-console game, the PlayStation 2 version is, sadly, not the best. In fact, visually, it's the loser of the three console versions. That doesn't mean it's not good looking, it is, and I'll get to that later, but the GameCube and Xbox versions are easily better-looking versions.   With regards to gameplay, the GameCube and PlayStation 2 are exactly the same, but since I'm a much bigger fan of the PS2 controller than the GameCube controller I would chose the PS2 version, easy. I think the GameCube version has a slightly more confused controller setup than the PS2 version, so that's that.   As for the Xbox version versus the others, the Xbox game contains two extra levels not found in either of the others. It offers two missions with Kraven the Hunter. Mind you, these aren't stunningly insane levels that you MUST HAVE, they're pretty average in fact, but they do retain a fan attraction that's pretty irresistible in their own way. And the PS2 version shows off more flicker, aliasing problems, longer load times, and a slower framerate than either of the others.   Graphics  As I have been saying, the PS2 version isn't the best of the three console versions, so that's a drag. But standing on its own, the game features several nice touches. The swinging and outdoor levels are huge and bustling. An enormous landscape is filled with moving cars, choppers buzzing in mid-air, and dozens of various building structures that will catch your eye.    There is some nice reflection mapping going on in the windows of skyscrapers while you shouldn't miss the cacophony of shameless ads and plugs for Activision and Treyarch. As usual, the other best things about the looks in Spider-Man, as in all PS2 games, are the lighting effects and explosions.   One particular level that looks lush, colorful, and shows off a nice set of effects is the Vulture boss fight, ~Air Duel With Vulture.~ The sky is filled with rain, and clouds loom ominously above. A nice layer of cloud textures moves across the sky, creating depth and detail. As Spidey fights the scraggly but nicely rendered Vulture, the rain eventually halts, and the sky begins to clear, with light rays piercing down, and a rainbow appearing in one section of the changing sky. It's nicely done.      The costumes and character models reflect a highly specialized look, which is in some ways better looking than the comic book versions of the same characters. Scorpion, Goblin and Vulture show off excellent facial features, and tons of excellent animations. Vulture especially looks great. He's perfectly bald-headed and wrinkly, with a bent nose and skinny neck, and when he's flying there's all sorts of feathers flying off his body. His wings are full and wide, and sweet looking. Even the civilians, cops, and basic thugs look good.    The Goblin is a little more revamped for the movie, but he nonetheless looks good, and his arsenal of pumpkin bombs and razor projectiles are nicely rendered. Unfortunately, Mary-Jane Watson is rather dumpy looking, and looks weirdly like a combination of Kirsten Dunst and the comic book character, which is just weird.    Which brings us to the CG. Some of it is good, none of it is bad looking, but never do you feel as if you're watching real human bodies moving about in the actual way humans behave. At least the CG loads in quickly.     Sound  Since the game is mostly based on the movie, Activision was able to use the live voices of Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe as Spider-Man and the Green Goblin, respectively. This is a good thing because when you get the game the voices sound, well, exactly like those in the movie...because they are. Hey hey!    But, while Dafoe makes a mean Green Goblin, Maguire is remarkably staid with his interpretation of Peter Parker, so much so that I often felt he was, well...overpaid. This man can be downright boring as the videogame character of Spider-Man. His delivery is flat as a pancake 50% of the time, while in the other 50% he's pretty good. Pretty good. Naturally, I could have done a much better job as Spider-Man and...just kidding. He's OK. Kirsten Dunst did not contribute her voice as Miss Mary-Jane Watson, but it's no loss since she's hardly in this game at all.    The star voice actor in Spider-Man, however, is the remarkable, unstoppable, unflappable Bruce Campbell. In a role that's similar to Stan Lee's in Spider-Man and Spider-Man Enter: Electro on PlayStation, Campbell is incredibly flippant, sarcastic, and always hilarious in his own unique way. His bout as training narrator bleeds into the first few levels of the game is brilliant videogame stuff. Bravo. One last addition, the screech of the Vulture is just awesome, it sounds great. His appearance is so nicely crafted in every aspect.   The game music appears to share the same themes and approach that the movie takes, and so players get to hear sweeping and dramatic tunes that fill in great when the action occurs. It does the job well. And the sound effects are good, especially the web effects. Spider-Man on PS2 uses Dolby Surround Pro Logic II, which is good, but if you listen to the Xbox stuff, well, it sounds better than the PS2 version. I have already played though this game once, and I'm thoroughly enjoying Spider-Man the second time through, something I rarely get to do (thank you, slow April). While a number of the same issues pop up with regard to cameras, control and whatnot, Spider-Man is an excellent action game that's easy to pick up and play again and again. And in my humble opinion, it's the best of the three because it offers gamers more than the first two. It offers more styles of fighting, thanks to the tons of extra moves and air combat controls; more mission variety, once again adding stealth into the mix; and a wonderful sense of 3D control that simply wasn't fleshed out as richly in the other two versions. The character roster is weaker, yes, but gamers do get to fight two classic Spidey villains, Vulture and Green Goblin, and as for the Green Goblin, well he's one of the greatest Spider-man villains ever. In this game, you fight the Green Goblin several times and in several different ways, all of which are new. Plus hey, riding on the Goblin Flyer is awesome. The reason this gets a lower score than the first PlayStation version is easy to explain. For NeverSoft to pull off this kind of 3D engine on PlayStation, a 32-bit system, was simply amazing at the time. And that game captured for the first time the real flair of Spider-Man and it represented the very first and best superhero game ever. It easily deserved a 9 out of 10. With Spider-Man on PS2, the game is good, to be sure, and though it's not quite an 8.5, it takes the editor's choice because it's a damned good superhero game as well as a memorable action game. But expectations for next-generation games have risen since 1999, and while Spider-Man is a good game, it's not without its problems. Still, as a Spider-Man fan and a plan old gamer, I'm happy as a clam, and I highly recommend this game.", "date": "Apr 17, 2002"}
