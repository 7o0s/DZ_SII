Not only are we seeing more and more ads and commercials promoting Sony Online, but SCEA is cooking up a host of big name online titles such as Syphon Filter Online, and Gran Turismo Online for starters.   But who says online games have to be about being a secret government agent or racing hundreds of exotic (and not so exotic) cars from around the world? What about having a simple and innocent good time playing some simple and innocent games based on classics that many of us still hold dear to our heart? Sony's answer is My Street, a collection of mini-games that can be played online (or not), and the results are more nostalgic than they are deep, but whoever said that was a bad thing?   Gameplay When you first start My Street, you can either select from a pre-made character, or create your own by mixing and matching a number of body parts, hairstyles, and clothing items. While you can make some kooky looking characters, what I find almost disturbing about the game is some the options it gives you. For example, I created a Caucasian male boy with corn roes and a painted black face, except for large circles around his eyes and mouth. Now I'm not sure if I'm being delusional, but my character looked like he was straight out of Spike Lee's Bamboozled. No lie. There are also other racial and cultural stereotypes found throughout the game, whether it's a characters clothes or their manner of speech. Take the line ~You are for real unprepared to play with me. You don't have any bling bling, no marbles kid.~ After creating my character, this was the first line that was spoken to me. I understand that the game is trying to portray a ~hip and cool~ image, but I think maybe the game could send out the wrong message to kids.  Going back to the gameplay, you have three modes of play from which to choose from: story, play, and netplay. The story mode enables you to hang out in your neighborhood while you talk to other kids. Many of them want to play games but cannot due to missing items and whatnot. Your job will be to recover these items and make your neighborhood safe and fun again. Well, it's not exactly like that, but you get the drift.  The story mode moves a little too slow, especially since most of you will probably want to play the mini-games. That is what this game's about, right? It's nice that the mode is there: It adds some replay value to the game, but there's little motivation to play it. Add a frustrating camera and day/night changes that force you to retire for the day, and the story mode is more of a nuisance than a welcome addition.     Luckily, the play mode will throw you straight into the game where you can immediately play any of the games. All you have to do is talk to the appropriate child and you're on your way. Unfortunately, many of the times the said child is running around the neighborhood, and you have to actually chase them down just to talk to them. Why can't they move slower, or better yet, stand still so that playing a game doesn't turn into a game of hide and seek? It's not a major problem, but it's not the most user-friendly interface either.    The Games Marbles Do you like marbles? If you do, you might like this game, or...not. While not a re-creation of the standard marbles game that people played back in the day, many of the same principles apply. A marble shooter enables you to knock marbles into your goal, or outside the ring. You actually control the shooter and can activate a magnet to attract the marbles to you. And, there are power-ups that you can pick up to give you an edge over the opponents.  This is probably my least favorite of the bunch. The physics feel awkward, and the feeling of control doesn't feel right. It also feels like you're winning or losing from luck, rather than skill. Maybe a straightforward marbles game would have been better.  RC Racing  The RC Racing game is almost an exact clone of the old classic arcade game, Super Off Road, and that's what makes this game one of the best. It feels almost identical, right down to the physics and nitros. You have a decent number of tracks to select from, plus you can race forward, backward, or have two players going one way and the other two the other. Also, some of the tracks use buggy cars, while others use tanks or monster trucks. They don't feel too different, but at least it adds some variety.   Volleyball  This is very similar to many of the old 8-bit volleyball games, and that's a good thing. Once you get the timing down, you can actually get a decent game going. What hurts this game is the clumsy AI of your partner and opponents and the sluggishness of the characters. Still, the game is playable, and some would argue that the system is deeper than the recently released DOA Xtreme Beach Volleyball (though don't expect to see girls in lacey bikinis running around).   Lawnmowers  Much in the vein of the classic racer Super Sprint, the lawnmowers game has you racing from a top-down perspective, the main difference being that you're on a lawnmower and not in a fast F1 racing car. There's also a little more strategy involved in the game due to the weeds and flowers. See, the more grass you mow, the more points you get. But, if you mow over the beautiful flowers, you get points deducted. Luckily, there are weeds around that will give you bonus points and help you keep your score up.   The lawnmowers game is mildly fun, but some of the course design is questionable, as is the enemy AI. Also, even though you're on a lawnmower, the game could've used a little more oomph in the speed department. As is, the game is just too slow, making for an underwhelming experience.  Chicken Herding The chicken herding game is an obviously Chu Chu Rocket-inspired. In it, your goal is to herd the chickens into your goal while herding the pigs into your opponents. You do this by placing arrows on a grid, causing whatever touches that arrow to run that way. The concept is a good one, but the execution falls a little short. The problem is that things become too chaotic for you to compose any real strategy. Since the game is aimed for a younger audience, maybe this was a conscious decision, but as a huge Chu Chu Rocket fan, this is a little disappointing.  Chemistry Now we come to the chemistry game. While it may not sound like it, the game is heavily inspired by the Puyo Puyo games. But like some of the other games, the execution misses the mark. Chemistry almost feels like a dumbed-down version of Puyo Puyo with an added laser gun that you use to shoot away your blocks of chemicals. Again, this game could probably entertain the wazzoo out of a child, but those expecting even a faithful re-creation of the classic puzzle game may be in for a rude awakening.  Dodgeball One of the great classic games from the 8-bit days is Super Dodgeball, and the dodgeball game in My Street does a fair job of re-creating the nostalgia and excitement of the original. While the game could play a little smoother, it is still decent fun and is one of the better ones on this roster. But, as mentioned, it suffers from the some of the same problems as the other games, namely AI issues and slightly sluggish controls. Maybe that's how the controls were back in the day, but a little improvement would've been appreciated.    Online Assuming you've previously configured your online account, getting online in My Street is a relatively straightforward affair. Just click on the Net play option and go. (On a side note, LAN play is also supported for those of you who have the resources.) Once you've gone in, you can either play/join a game or receive any news updates about the game. If you decide to play, the game will pull up a list of game servers which are filtered by three different skill levels: I'm new at this; I'm pretty good; and I RULE. After selecting, you can join or create a game. If you create a game, you also have the options to lock the game so no new players can join, and also to kick out any player (y'know, for those causing trouble and talking too much smack).   Online play is always appreciated, but in this sort of game where everyone is onscreen at once, playing with some friends at your house is almost more fun. There you can talk smack and ~accidentally~ mess up your friends when they're winning. Really, one of the great things about online play is that you only see what you're doing, and not everyone else. That's what provides a lot of the mystery and surprise in some online games. The biggest benefit here is that you have unlimited opponents, assuming that there are people online and willing to play. Also, talking to people while playing them is also typical of online games, but the given method (choosing letter by letter with the control pad) is almost worthless, unless you only want to say ~hi.~ The fact that the game doesn't include keyboard support makes trying to communicate even more difficult. Maybe next time.  Graphics My Street is targeted for a younger audience, and it shows. The visual style is most reminiscent of Nickelodeon cartoons, with exaggerated character figures and environments with skewed perspectives. Buildings are architecturally impossible with angles that are curved and shoot out in every which direction; Characters have disproportionate arms, legs and heads; Colors are bright, bold and primary. It's not a style for everyone, but I can see the appeal it would have for a pre-teen child. Take that as you will.    From a technical standpoint, My Street doesn't push any boundaries, but instead gets the job done in a more-or-less utilitarian fashion: the game moves at a steady framerate, the particle and water effects are decent but far from special, and the day to night shifts are understandable, but hardly awe-inspiring. Also, the textures in the game are a little blurry, but recognizable. Actually, a lot of the game appears to rely more on flat shading than textures, but if you look closely, you'll notice that the textures are just very simple and subtle.   Overall, My Street is a relatively simple looking game with a style that you'll either love or hate. I can understand the need for child-friendly graphics, but a little graphical flash wouldn't have hurt.      Sound Aurally, My Street is a typical mix of bubbly Saturday morning music -- perfect for this type of game, but good for little else. Like the graphics, it's something you'll appreciate or loathe. There really is very little middle ground. Also, heard abundantly throughout the game are one-liners voiced by just about every character you see. These voices (in the one-liners and in the cutscenes) are heard much too often and grow on your nerves that much quicker. Luckily, you can you can adjust the voice volume, along with the sound effects and music volume in the options screen. My advice is to turn the music and voices off and play to your favorite CD instead.My Street is game with a good concept, but flawed execution. There could've been more games, and each one could've been fleshed out a bit more. Still, the game's target audience is pretty young, so maybe the simple games are a good thing. But, the game's target audience is also what I find a little odd: I can't imagine many young children playing their PS2's online. Still, the game is decent fun in short bursts with some friends in the standard multiplayer mode -- just don't expect much more from the game. For younger children, this game could be a blast. For everyone else, there are better party games to play (unless you really want another online game).", "date": "Mar 11, 2003"}
