The developers at Wide Games have brought that vision to the Xbox in Prisoner of War, as close you'll get to walking the yards of Stalag Luft and Colditz Castle. Originally conceived as a PC title and headed for that platform later this year, Prisoner of War is the ultimate stealth game because you'll be using your mind and cunning, not guns and grenades, to succeed. But after a few successful escapes of our own with the game's main character, Captain Lewis Stone, it's clear that for all of its brilliant gameplay ideas (comprehensive camp A.I. routines), Prisoner of War is better suited for a more patient and more tolerable PC gaming audience than a console audience that demands more instant gratification.  Gameplay  The prison camps in POW are living environments full of suspicious guards on patrol, barbed wire fences, fellow POWs going about their business and time sensitive events. The daily routine, in order, includes morning roll call, breakfast, morning exercise, lunch, afternoon free time, dinner, evening roll call and lights out. They happen at the same time everyday and provide the structure for your activities since you'll be ditching meals and whatnot to accomplish tasks around the different prison camps. Miss a roll call however, and you'd better be prepared for some serious sneaking since it puts the entire camp on alert. The in-game clock always lets you know where you should be at that moment and what  your next ~appointment~ is going to be.   The guards have vision cones just like the ones found in Metal Gear Solid and keeping track of these on your radar is imperative to your success. As long as you're where you're supposed to be and doing what you're supposed to be doing there's no problem with the guards seeing you. If you're outside of your barracks after lights out or stand too close to the barbed wire fence surrounding the camp, they'll shoot and/or arrest you. Bulky items like crowbars or disguises that can't be stuffed in a pocket and have to be held in plain sight will also set the guards off if they see you.     Each of the four missions in the game has several sub-missions or objectives to complete and often one leads into the other. For example upon your arrival in Stalag Luft, you have to earn the respect of the other prisoners --each of whom has a distinct personality and purpose in the game-- so you're given a mission to sneak into the camp's administrative building and play the national anthem over the camp loudspeakers. This objective, like many of the others, borrows from the cannon of great prison films like The Shawshank Redemption and The Great Escape. It's only after, in the cutscene, that you find out that your prank was also meant as a diversion so the other POWs, lead by the camp's Escape Committee, could steal some secret plans elsewhere in the prison. I had no problem with the basic set up of real time play unlocking a story driving cutscene.   The frustration sets in when you realize that very little is laid out for you in Prisoner of War. The developers encourage interaction with the dozen or more inmates, not to mention crooked guards, to gain valuable information about your current objective. It usually works where after completing the previous mission, you'll be given the next objective, but it's totally up to you to figure out how to go about it. The different prisoners have different dialects, angles and purposes and hitting the A button to interact with them can open up a menu of 2-4 phrases you can say to each of them. It takes a pretty comprehensive survey of guys to get the bits and pieces of info you need to come up with an idea of how to accomplish the task at hand. It will feel familiar to RPG fans but there's very little item collection or leveling up to make the chatter immediately worth it.   Each prisoner has his own look with a distinctive uniform, insignia and face, but it's still extremely difficult to tell the difference between two similar characters at a glance. Since the game's clock is always ticking away, time is of the essence and it really irritated me to be talking to the wrong guy knowing time is running out. You eventually realize who the truly helpful prisoners are but knowing where and how to find them in a timely manner is an expert level skill that you probably won't develop until you're 75% through the game.   Then you have the real time gameplay itself. Those times when you actually have to start climbing fences, hiding under trucks and throwing rocks for distraction purposes can be a bit frustrating as well, because Wide Games' third person action-adventure engine has a camera that will betray you at the most inopportune times. This is a stealth game so knowing your immediate surroundings is imperative in a game where you're constantly forced to sneak extremely close to and just out of the vision of guards. You have controls to duck, switch to a temporary first person view and stand flat against walls and whatnot so with the twitch camera you'll end up with a lot of extreme close-ups of dirt, the sky or the back of Captain Stone's head. Even though you have control of the camera on the right analog stick, you don't want your reaction times slowed because you can't see what's going on around you.   The guards have multiple stages of alert from normal to suspicious to P.Oed. When they're vision codes turn to red which means they know what you're up to and looking to arrest you, you can always rely on the ever cheesy ~run and hide until they forget~ method that has worked ever since Solid Snake first donned a headband. They close in pretty fast so you have to stay mobile since all they have to do to arrest you is get within a few feet of Stone. Or if you're really somewhere you shouldn't be, like the Kommandant house, they're just going to shoot to kill in which case you're headed for the infirmary. When you're arrested or injured you often lose valuable items, currency (contraband you can use for favors and bribes) and time. The game continues for you even when you're thrown in ~the cooler~ (solitary confinement) and the developers have provided ways for you to buy back or otherwise re-acquire any items that you've lost. However, at no point did we find it necessary to go through this whole process. It's much easier to save your game after a crucial point such as finding an important item or receiving a new mission, and simply reloading from that point when you're sent to the infirmary or the cooler. The game even gives you the option of continuing or loading your last save game from that menu. These two cheese-laden shortcuts are simply too much to resist in a game that doesn't move very fast to begin with and that can get even more bogged down when you're sitting in sick bay or in the hole.   It's single player only and the story of the game is very well written and presented. There's even a strong dose of humor in the game brought to you by the various personalities of the prison camps. You've got Polish Majors, French Privates and American Sergeants all in one place and a ton of jokes waiting in the wings when you talk to them. We would've liked more prison humor, but this game wants to be taken more seriously than that.   Graphics  This is another roadblock for Prisoner of War. Even with all of the sophisticated AI  pushing everybody around the prison camps, I expected this game to look a lot better than it does. The detail in the characters and the camp buildings themselves is lacking and the and overall the game just looks flat.    The animation of the guards and prisoners is extremely stiff and unnatural as well. They walk, they run and some of the aim and shoot, but nobody looks very realistic doing it. Arms and legs move to simulate movements but there's no sensation of mass or real physiology where all body parts are connected.   The lack of detail and textures ends up making everything look flat and all of this is emphasized during the conversation between Stone and the prisoners when the camera zooms in nice and tight. Mouths move when characters talk, but at the same time most of the guards all look alike. Not sure what that's saying about the German people but, whatever.   Sound  The surround sound in Prisoner of War has great separation even though the final version we reviewed still had plenty of popping and sound drops. Plus the soundtrack, and the application of that music, is truly outstanding.   POW, along with the upcoming Splinter Cell, should really set the pace for dynamic, interactive music in videogames. There are only a handful of instrumental background pieces but they're implemented and attached to events that you initiate in the game. Sneaking around at night will have a rich forbidden theme to it that will have you sitting on edge the whole time. The times when you're trying to figure out a way through a problem, the game almost seems to know it and plays, for lack of a better term, a thinking song. Very well done.   Nice sound effects like cans being knocked over or bumping into a chair will produce a startling enough sound that you'll swear the guards are going to hear it. A thumping heartbeat sound kicks in whenever you start doing something that you shouldn't be doing. It gets louder and faster the closer you get to being caught. When the heart stops pounding it's a great indication that the guards aren't on alert for you anymore.  I really liked what Prisoner of War was trying to accomplish but it ultimately fell short of providing a fun experience to go with all of that realistic immersive WWII prison camp stuff. The rewards were too few and too far in between to justify some of the long drawn out missions that inevitably require multiple restarts. Like I said some of the talking elements will appeal to RPG fans but you'll missing all of the leveling up and weapons and new abilities that usually accompany that much babbling. It's not that it needs violence to be more enjoyable. On the contrary, Prisoner of War was a nice change of pace from the usual third person fare. But a quicker pace with more objectives that lead one right into the other might have done the trick. This one is definitely worth a rental or simply wait to see what's done differently in the PC version.", "date": "Aug 21, 2002"}
