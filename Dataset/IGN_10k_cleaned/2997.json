Eidos brings the story of Agent 47, a genetically engineered killing machine, to the consoles after introducing him in the original Hitman: Codename 47 on PC. In the case of the Xbox version, there are only a handful of glitches and irritants to suggest this game's PC roots and so for the most part, Xboxers are getting a well conceived and executed third person game with superior video and audio elements worthy of the system.   Story  The story of H2 is more engaging than 80% of the third person action games out there and actually motivates you to get the job(s) done. Agent 47 is recovering from his last adventure (see here) at a monastery in Sicily. He's forced to return to work as an assassin when his host his kidnapped by some ruthless Sicilian gangsters. To get the info he needs he has to perform a gauntlet of missions for the agency. From the streets of St. Petersburg to steamy alleys of Jakarta, we're taken on a whirlwind world tour of assassinations and impersonations.   Gameplay  Hitman 2 succeeds because it pays attention to every detail that applies to a professional hitman, at least our collective vision of what a hitman is all about. Players are given an ever growing arsenal of weapons throughout the game, specialized assassin-only moves like ~sneak mode~ and just enough intel so that we know the who, what, when and where but it's up to us to figure out how to do the job.   Missions are graded according to the amount of stealth and aggression you use to make the hit. Usually you're free and clear to murder and entire mansion or villa full of people as long as you get the target, but you'll receive considerable style points and a better assassin rating for limiting the violence to the target and the target only. The best part of all this is that in any given mission there are multiple paths to the same objective and you can use as little or as much violence as you see fit in each situation you encounter. So while it may be necessary to kill the guard hovering around a locker where your weapons are stored, you don't necessarily have to kill his buddy around the corner. That is, unless the buddy comes wandering around the corner just as you're trying to dispose of his friend's body. Then he has to go too.     Wearing disguises is such an extremely important part of the game, you'll have to be aware of how others will perceive Agent 47's actions and equipment. Dressing as a Russian soldier is common, so it's no big deal for 47 to be walking around with an AK assault rifle in his hands. He can even walk by and brush shoulders with other Russian soldiers in that situation. But put a high powered sniper rifle in his hands instead and he'd better keep his distance from other soldiers or the subterfuge won't last. In this example, there are surely ways to accomplish the mission whether you want to use a sniper rifle or infiltrate as a Russian soldier, it's completely up to you. The hook here is that you'd better have a well thought out plan that solves the immediate problem and will allow you to reach the overall objective of the mission.  The A.I. of the non playable characters in Hitman 2 is more refined than in other third person action games because there are so many of them in any given mission and they're not all necessarily going to be enemies. In fact, a truly stealthy Hitman 2 player will only eliminate the target, the only true enemy in a mission, whilst leaving all of the bodyguards, soldiers and cops to live and protect again another day. While you're disguised, you'll know you're in danger of being exposed as an assassin when your suspicion meter fills up and enemies watch your movements and scratch their heads as they try to figure out who you are and what you're up to. This is a time when the novice Hitman 2 player will panic and kill that nosy sucker, probably with a shotgun or some other attention-getting weapon. The assassin with ice in his or her veins will just keep on about their business, trust in their disguise and act like they know what they're doing. Those skills are usually helpful in real life too. One complaint here is that if and when the enemies all turn on you and come for you with guns blazing, the ensuing gunfight can easily be won if you keep your distance. At point blank range, even grunts are dangerous but at a distance you can usually put those Quake III skills to use and switch to first person mode by hitting the white button.   This mix of actions and consequences leads to a lot of trial-and-error gameplay, but Hitman 2 does it in a way that we found to be more enjoyable than not. In a game like Dead to Rights, for example, Slate would sometimes die repeatedly simply because you'd be unprepared for the number and/or power of the enemies. The challenge would be obvious: get them before they get you. In Hitman 2, you're confronted with obstacles and challenges that could've been avoided altogether had you done something different. Furthermore, sometimes non-action is the best action. Stopping to kill a guard who's blown your cover doesn't always make sense in a crowded hall or area with lots of guards around. If you run into a room and do him and all of his buddies in there, you can just leave the bodies there instead of dragging them one at a time to a hiding place. Hiding seven or eight bodies lying in a hallway not only exposes you to more harm, but it takes up a lot of valuable time.   Hitman 2 has some of the coolest gear and gadgets ever assembled in a videogame. You get to keep weapons you take from downed enemies during a mission and collect them in your weapons hut back at the monastery. You can even see outlines of gadgets and guns you have yet to pick up. Before missions you get to pick which pistols and rifles, of the ones you've collected so far, you want to take with you but you're assigned specialized gear automatically for missions as well. Stuff like poison, remote bombs, and night vision goggles are all thrown into the mix for one-time, one-mission usage. As cool as all of these gadgets and guns are, sometimes the application of those tools either isn't apparent or is completely missing when you get into a mission. Many times the coolest gadgets are intended for the more stealthy Hitman 2 player while the wide selection of weapons is meant to appeal to the mass murderer out there. Sometimes you'll get a prompt for when you're supposed to use the remote controlled bomb, other times they'll give you a car bomb, and let you figure out how to use it, but with the understanding that you may not use it at all if you're not the stealthy type. Like remote mines in GoldenEye some of the stuff in Hitman 2 is just there for those times when you want to be mean to the enemies.   As a third person game, the camera and aiming control in Hitman 2 deserve special scrutiny. Even though the controls seem surprisingly well tuned for the console, you still get a lot of fudging on the aiming mechanism. With everything but a sniper rifle, you're really taking your chances with targets at a distance because even with the crosshairs lined up perfectly you can still miss still targets. Likewise, you're given credit for shots that obviously should've whizzed by. The camera is controlled with the right analog stick and can't actually be your best friend if you learn how to manipulate it correctly. The camera often gets hung up in tight corners or when Agent 47 climbs through sewer openings. But there are benefits in those situations. By manipulating the camera the player can become his eye in the sky or on the ground and see what's going on around the corner or up on the street without exposing Agent 47 to danger. It's so pronounced that it seems intentional. Furthermore, unlike most games, the enemies in H2 can look inside a sewer opening and see that there's a guy with a gun on a ladder or they can quickly peek around a corner and see there's somebody there. IO Interactive flipped the script and actually added a gameplay function to a problem that has plagued developers of third person games since the mid 1990s.  The camera and control do seem designed for a slower paced, more stealthy style of gameplay. The left trigger toggles 47 in and out of sneak mode where he moves much slower, on his toes, but he's super quiet. Perfect for sneaking up on a mark and silently jacking him with a knife or fiber wire. So while the control is responsive for quick reactions to dangerous situations, you're not supposed to be running all over the place annihilating everything in sight, although you will be tempted to do so quite a bit. In fact, when you're in disguise, which is 90% of the time if you're smart, you probably shouldn't be running since it will draw attention to your behavior. Some levels can take a long time to finish simply because you have to walk around calmly to maintain your disguise, but then again that's where H2's save anywhere function comes in so handy.   Graphics  This game looks like right at home on the Xbox with a blazing framerate and detailed environments and characters as refined as any on the system. The animation is especially well done and fits the theme of the game from top to bottom.    Every step and movement Agent 47 makes looks authentic as if he were actually made of flesh and bone instead of little bits of color on your TV screen. When he goes to clobber an enemy at close range with the butt of his rifle it's a quick compact move where you see his elbow slicing up into the guy's jaw. Breaking out the fiber wire to strangle somebody is a short but elaborate sequence where he swiftly reaches up and over the victim's head with his arms crossed and scissors them back into place once the cord is around the guy's neck. The two characters animate separately in a sequence like that instead of jumping into a two-man animation like we see in some sports games. The result is, whether it's a strangulation or a body being dragged, one character is acting upon the other and the reaction is looks natural. In the case of dragging bodies, the rag-doll animations work very well, until you start testing just how far they'll go. We had a moral obligation to not show you screens of the grotesque ways you can bend and fold bodies in Hitman 2 simply by dragging them to and fro.  The animation is done well enough that you can even perform multiple moves at once like dragging a body while picking a lock in sneak mode. This too can lead to some bizarre scenes if you take it to far, but for the most part you'll get a kick out of all the things you're allowed to pull off in this game.   The lighting in Hitman 2 is very good but just short of great since shadows can be a little inconsistent and jaggy sometimes. When there are light sources around, you'll see the dark and light sides of Agent 47's head and outfit but too many times we noticed inconsistencies with those light sources. Not that hiding in shadows is a big part of this game, but shooting out every light in an underground tunnel and donning night vision goggles made sense to us until we tried it and it was still too bright down there. In all out firefights, you'll see the entire room light up from the muzzle flash of weapons and blood stains splatter in patterns on the wall and floor. When the bodies start to pile up you can end up making Hitman 2 look like the last scene in Scarface  The environments in Hitman 2 can be breathtaking. The monastery is a kind of hubworld where you can select your weapons and practice moves before departing on a mission, and it's absolutely gorgeous indoors and out. We have yet to notice a stutter in the frame rate even when moving quickly between indoor and outdoor environments. The architecture on some of the levels is so well done that you'll wonder why other games can't pull off cathedrals, subway stations and sections of cities this well. While there isn't much draw distance in Hitman 2, the areas we are allowed to see are expansive, usually with multiple levels and complex designs.    Sound  With an outstanding original score by the Budapest Radio Symphony Orchestra and Choir, Hitman 2 ranks right up there with the almighty Halo when it comes to music application. Throw in some fine sound effects for weapons and you're easily immersed in this experience. Too bad there's no surround sound to bring it all home.    The music of most big budget action movies won't move you like the music of Hitman 2. It takes the gamer through all of the ups and downs and tense moments of the game and fades softly into the background when it needs to so you can hear everything you need to hear.   Most of the sound effects in Hitman 2 are limited to Agent 47 and his immediate surroundings. Outside of frightened women at cocktail parties screaming and the thud of bullets hitting bad guys at close range, there isn't much in his world that makes noise. You'll hear his footsteps, the clicking of his guns reloading and some very good voice acting when he communicates with the sweet sweet Diana back at the agency.  Hitman 2 makes for a fine stealth-action game on the Xbox because of its clear focus on assassinations. As we've seen from Antonio Banderas and Jean Reno, the life of a professional hitman can be both adventurous and slow-paced. The fact that you can run through the game in just a few hours and kill everything in sight is balanced by all of the fun waiting for you if you try the more realistic stealthy gameplay.When I put H2 up against similar title out there, it easily ranks among the top handful of third person games on Xbox. Even in the growing sub-category of third person stealth-action, Hitman 2 isn't too far removed from Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance and Splinter Cell when it comes to overall polish and presentation. Even with its minor shortcomings, Hitman 2 would be a runaway hit if it wasn't caught up in the logjam of late 2002 releases.", "date": "Oct 2, 2002"}
