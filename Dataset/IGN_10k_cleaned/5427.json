Back in the day, these cats made miracles happen. They juiced some of the most gonzo visuals from the C64 and Amiga that left you salivating all over the pages of ~Compute!~ magazine. Perhaps their finest achievement was, and still is, Defender of the Crown, a serf's-up strategy game that pitted you against the rest of a not-so-merry ol' England in a war for land and gold.   Well, Defender of the Crown is back. The game has enjoyed something of a renaissance (ho ho) lately, and Digital Bridges is keeping the Wayback Machine going with a mobile edition of the classic game. Time has often been unkind to resurrected classics, but Defender of the Crown's re-release on the Game Boy Advance proved it still had the heart to be a champion. It's too bad, though, that this to-go edition of the game stinks like Friar Tuck after a four-week mead bender.   The problem isn't necessarily the fundamentals of the game. Everything is still in place, from buying troops to launching boulders via catapults to entering jousting competitions for glory. But the control is terribly off in the action sequences, rending some portions downright unplayable, and there is a pivotal problem with the map screen that prevents you from moving your troops to gather up men for an invading party.   Another total botch is that when you buy new troops for your army, they are automatically sent to the castle in your original territory. Once troops have been bought, it's a mess to get them out of the castle and into your invasion force. Scrolling through text screens, trying to recall what territory has what number of troops, is a total pain. Not that it really maters, because the computer is positively merciless with you. It knows exactly which territory is weak and seizes on the opportunity without giving you even the most remote chance to beef up forces. It's not like it punishes you once for forgetting to guard an area, it beats you down over and over again. Defender of the Crown soon becomes more of a trial-by-error game than a strategy contest.   The action sequences are totally ruined by awful control and bad animation. Just to make sure we weren't being unnecessarily harsh on Defender of the Crown, we played the GBA port to compare the scenes. The jousting sequences are botched by bad control that leaves you at the mercy of timing you ca never get ahead of. You're supposed to direct your first-person lance at the opposing knight, but, well, good luck with that. The hard-to-see lance bobs around as if you're not even controlling it at all. The swashbuckling castle raids have been simplified to jamming on the action button and inching forward. There is no real swordplay, and thusly, no excitement.   The better your phone, the better Defender of the Crown looks. For example, downloaded on an LG VX6000, Defender of the Crown is ugly. On the QD, though -- not too shabby. But the game still looked better on the Amiga, and how old is that machine?  Woe to the gamer that downloads Defender of the Crown with memories of past glory. This port is a shell of the game's former self, bearing only a passing resemblance from the visual standpoint -- but the control is way off and the map screens are bizarrely complicated and lacking in crucial information that you would hope an update would have.
