{"name": "Rayman", "name_review": "Rayman", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/25/rayman-4", "text": "Platform games seem to be a thing of the 16-bit past. Games in which you move from left to right, collecting items and jumping on enemies' heads are just such a part of the 16-bit experience. To try and convert that  to 32-bit would be a difficult task. Take, for example, Sega's ill-fated, track-laden Bug! or even the conversions of Earthworm Jim 2. Sure it's a good game, but on the superior 32-bit machine, it all seems a little pointless.  Initially, Rayman appears to be a contender for the same fate. However, it is surprisingly enjoyable. What separates it from the rest is its cleverness. Yeah, that's right, cleverness. Maybe not as twisted as our pal Jim, but clever nonetheless. You have to climb through maze-like environments, navigate hazardous skies, and swing from perilous, suspended hooks.Sure, it's just like every other platformer but Rayman is done surprisingly well. Well enough, in fact, to warrant your precious gaming time.", "date": "Nov 25, 1996"}
