Just the thought of the television show's high production values, acting and innovative choreography coming home as a videogame had site editor Cory D. Lewis foaming at the mouth and howling at the moon in anticipation, in fact. But had we known that the shining excellence set forth by the pioneering, ever popular (read: 1991) afternoon series would hit N64 as a repetitive, dull, sloppy -- well, shall we say, uninspired piece of software, we might have preferred that the Power Rangers remain a television exclusive.   Wait a minute, we did prefer that! But alas, THQ would not listen to our pleas and now all Nintendo 64 owners must suffer through this gargantuan hour and a half adventure and all of the misery inducing gameplay mechanics that it dishes out. ~Quaking Cosmos, it's time to save the world!~  The Facts  Support for 1 or 2 players simultaneously Fully 3D characters in a 3D world Over 30 levels of action including Ranger, Vehicle, and Mega Zord games.   Tons of vehicles and weapons from the Power Rangers universe A new character exclusive to Power Rangers 7th season: the Titanium Ranger Authentic music and sound effects from the TV show Actual character voices by the Power Rangers Lightspeed actors and actresses Huge boss battles with monsters from the TV show including Diabolico, Magmavore, and others Compatible with the Nintendo Controller Pak to save games in progress   Gameplay Based on the television series of the same name, Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue features all of everybody's favorite spandex-wearing, summersault-loving fruits in a battle to save the world from such evil foes as Diabolico and Magmavore. The story isn't much to look at so we won't bother recapturing it for you, we'll summarize; Power Rangers have been kidnapped, you have to rescue them, beat some bad guys, clean up some toxic spills, and ultimately rid the Earth from disaster. If the back story sounds formulaic it's because it is, but not nearly so much as the gameplay mechanics, visuals, sound, and presentation of the title. Our diary:   12:20 PM: Insert Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue into our Nintendo 64. 12:21 PM: Laugh at how poor the graphics look. 12:22 PM: Call friends over and point. Say things like, ~Wow, that's bad.~ 12:24 PM: Look around area and wonder what happened to all of our friends. 1:40 PM: Completely finish game -- all levels and multiplayer characters unlocked. 1:41 PM: Search for other possible length extending modes with no success. 1:45 PM: Try out multiplayer mode for one minute. Turn it off in disgust.   The game kicks off with a Java-based ~story mode~ illustrated by incredibly poor hand drawn art with two or three frames of animation each. This is when we say, ~Well this one is obviously made for kids. Let's just cut it a bit more slack then and push ahead.~ So we do. Then we are introduced to the first of four different gameplay scenarios. A Power Ranger must walk through a 3D top-down environment fighting off sub-par animated low-polygon enemies in a fight to save people or collect one of three coins. The main character, a pre-set Power Ranger color, seizures through these barren environments with exceptionally poor animation -- so bad that it nearly sets a new standard for hideous fluidity on N64. The control is tight enough -- we can move our Ranger in any direction and shoot out energy bursts at foes; A button shoots forward and B fires backward. But there really isn't much to do except shoot around mindlessly and keep walking. There is no jumping, crawling, kicking, punching, or fruity back-flips and summersaults. Evidently the Power Rangers forgot how to do all of these moves in their transition to Nintendo 64. And not only is everything incomparably boring, it's all way too easy. The level design and goals in all 30 level can be whipped through in just over an hour if you're moderately competent. Kids will have no problem toppling this one. In fact, monkeys should run into no barriers here either.  The other three gameplay scenarios are as follows: a side-view ~save the burning cars~ or ~clean up the toxic spill~ mode; you basically maneuver through a scrolling 2D-ish environment shooting wrecked vehicles with water, or, in the variation, running into toxic spills with your cleanup truck. Next you have the mech-like first-person mode; you play as Mega Zord and battle enemies. All you have to do here is press the A button 20 times to fire off projectiles at your foe and the mode is over. Moving on, we have the flying game; you control a hovering vehicle that has to collect boxes located around a crap looking city. And that's it. These same three level styles are regurgitated through 30 stages -- usually without any changes in graphic appearance. It's repetitive and extremely uneventful gameplay.  The multiplayer mode, meanwhile, which enables two gamers to battle it out in first-person mech-ready arenas, is exactly the same mode from the single-player game only with split screen. It's an impressively poor single-player experience somehow made even worse as a multiplayer one.   Graphics At this point you might be wondering if there is any reason to buy Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue. The answer, dear friends, is no -- unless you hate yourself and like to suffer. The graphics that make up the shoddy ~kids game~ are of Super-NES first-generation quality, except in 3D. You'll become very familiar with the three of four different textures used per level if you continue to play the title. You may even try naming them as a more enjoyable alternative to playing through the life-sucking levels. ~Why hello Fred,~ you can say as you round another corner and see a texture that is identical to the ones used in the other 12 environments you've already bested. ~Fancy seeing you again old pal. I look forward to our next encounter, chap, perhaps in the following level.~ And you can take some comfort in knowing that when you do finally make it to the next area, usually three minutes per level, ~Fred~ will be right there again waiting for you.  The low-grade texture quality is unfortunately not out shined by spectacular animation either. The Power Rangers and enemies in Lightspeed Rescue are either all secretly robots from the year 1950, struggling to place one foot in front of the other, or they are lacking about 30 frames of animation. Our vote is for the latter. On a brighter note, there are three of four different enemy models to shoot at and some of the particle effects -- fire and energy bursts -- are passable. The title's greatest graphical standout is its framerate, sluggish at points but compared to the rest of the shortcomings a definite winner. The average fluidity is made possible by smart design on developer Mass Media's part -- no more than two or three very low-poly, barely animated enemies on-screen at once, stupidly plain background graphics and nothing else. The problem is while that may keep the framerate up, it won't keep the gamer playing.   Sound Comically poor.  Inexcusably bad speech samples for the entire game consist of two lines repeated over and over and over again, all mixed with compressed music samples that blend in with the mediocrity of everything else. Joy. Whether you're a 45 year-old rocket scientist or a five year-old monkey, this game sucks. Sorry. Some slower kids may enjoy it for a short while in the same way that one might enjoy chewing on a plastic block and staring blankly at a wall. But there's no challenge at all to be had in any form, the gameplay mechanics are boringly formulaic, the graphics and sound samples are downright poor and the multiplayer mode is an absolute bore. Not even recommended as a rental as it can be beaten in an hour flat.", "date": "Oct 3, 2000"}
