Since then, I haven't seen one shooter that has even come close to meeting these standards, until now. R-Type Delta, with ease, is the best side-scrolling shooter the PlayStation has seen this year and has definitely made a spot for itself as one of the best PS shooters of all time. Gameplay The only similarities that R-Type Delta has when compared to other R-Type games is, well, the name. For starters, R-Type Delta features, not one, not two, but three different warships to choose from, all in which have different Force attributes -- this alone should excite any R-Type fan.  When you start your game, you'll be able to pick from one of three ships, the Type 1: R9a, Type 2: Rx and the Type 3: R13. As you progress through the game, each ship can obtain one of three laser power-ups, which can be upgraded three times. But that's only the half of it. The Force module can be upgraded as well, and that's where a ship's play potential really differs.   For example, one of the ships, the R13, my personal favorite, features the Anchor Force, and here's how this ship in particular works. Unlike the R9a's Force unit, which plays similarly to all the previous ships that starred in the first R-Type games (you launch it, it fires lasers in various directions, etc.), the R13's Force, when launched, is hooked onto a laser chain. See, it doesn't fire, you basically have to maneuver your ship to where your laser chain can hit other ships. If used correctly, it can deliver some potent damage and might be the best Force weapon out of the three. The other one is the Tentacle Force and that one is alright, I guess. Anyway, the point is that when tired of playing through the game with just one ship, switch warships, it's almost a completely different game.  Speaking of playing through the game, R-Type Delta is hard! Even on easy, the game is super difficult, but fun as hell. But this shouldn't be mistaken for long gameplay. To put it bluntly, the game is short. There's only seven levels, and although it was great, when I got to the last level (and there's like babies in jars floating around), the game ended, and... that was it. So be forewarned, the game is fun, but it is hard and it's short. Graphics The graphics in this game can be summed up in one sound, mmm. I haven't seen a shooter that had a presentation like this since Einhander.   The environments alone, the level of detail and diversity, ahrg, it's just great. In fact, I found it so hard to just concentrate on the oncoming enemies, 'cause in the background, there's so much stuff going on. Right in the first level, you're like, cruising through this town and all of a sudden, this huge mechanical worm comes from the crashing through the buildings in the background and comes cruising through the foreground and almost takes you out. It's amazing.  I can honestly say that there were no complaints in the graphics department. There were tons of enemies, the bosses were cool looking, man, there was just so much stuff going on -- my eyes have never been this busy. Sound Again, no complaints. The sound effects in this game are unique and crisp, they totally fit each environment. From screaming metal fish, to ship explosions, the game boasts some weird and wild sounds like no other.  The music is cool as well. It's not as fast-paced as most shooters are (Einhander, G-Darius, etc.). The music in R-Type Delta, with the exception of some boss music, is really laid back, almost relaxing... almost. One thing I noticed is when you're cruising through Deformation area (Stage 2), there's a part where you can hover above, or go below, the water. It's cool. When you're above the water, there's this cool song going on, and when you go under water, the song gets muffled and sounds like a completely different tune, but it still maintains the same beat. Again, it's pretty cool. Overall I'm looking down the holiday list of games to buy this year, and as far as shooters go, there's not much out there. If you're a big fan of the shooter genre, and you're in the mood for another one, R-Type Delta, without a doubt, will sooth your appetite. It's a little short, and can be frustrating at times, but all in all, it's a great experience. I can't think of any other side-scroller that's coming out this year that could beat R-Type Delta.   -- Jay Boor", "date": "Sep 1, 1999"}
