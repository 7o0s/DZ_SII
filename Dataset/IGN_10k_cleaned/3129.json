{"name": "Divine Divinity", "name_review": "Divine Divinity", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/10/31/divine-divinity", "text": "I should start by reassuring you that I have nothing against market forces.  I have encouraged local and international merchants.  I have invested in stocks and bonds.  Some of my friends will tell you that I was even a dues-paying member of the necromancer's guild in Toledo, Spain, in 1162 AD, but that's a lie.  Really.  In any case, my point is that despite my proven capitalist credentials, there are times when I could wish the PC games retail shelf was a more controlled and level playing field.  One that isn't so greatly subject to the purchasing power of a few producers with the biggest bucks.   I'm sure you know what I mean.  A perfectly good game comes along, but it gets little store space and no wild, colorful displays or advertisements, because the producers couldn't afford that.  (Some great products don't even make it that far.  One of the most distinctive CRPG/strategy titles I've played, King of Dragon Pass, is only available for purchase on the Web.)  And the shame of it is, some really fine products end up being quickly remaindered because of nothing worse than low public visibility and shallow pockets.   Divine Divinity certainly qualifies on this score, lacking the marketing campaign and heavy commercial presence to draw your attention.  Worse still, perhaps, it suffers from a godawful game name that sounds like a Mel Brooks satire.  These factors aside, however, Divine Divinity is a truly fine CRPG, more varied and interesting than some recent, far more highly touted titles (cough, Neverwinter Nights, cough) in many respects.   It's also pretty apparent (at least, to me, but I could be hallucinating) that Divine Divinity draws heavily upon two other famous games for its structure and gameplay.  Let's take a glance at those titles, to see how they strongly influenced the development of Divine Divinity.   One Part Ultima VII...   Do you remember that 1992 hit, Ultima VII?  It hasn't been seen much since then, because the developers, Origin Systems, used a proprietary form of memory management that conflicts with Windows.  But what blew most of us away at the time weren't the great graphics or multiple person parties, but the fact that for the first time we could actually walk through a world that moved and regulated itself despite our presence: a world containing its own weather, day and night cycles, merchants who closed up shop at the end of business and went home, and thousands of items that existed as separate objects?including rakes, baskets, dinner plates and desk stamps.  Nothing 2D has approached it since (except for Ultima VII, part 2), but Divine Divinity comes closest.   There are no weather cycles in Divine Divinity, and though day/night occurs, it means nothing in the game: merchants stand around 24/7, which must be hell on the heels (not to mention the kidneys).  You also lead only one character in this 2D, isometric game.  On the other hand, rooms in buildings are extremely detailed, with even pots and pans in a kitchen rated for durability, weight and wear.  You'll find barrels, chests and boxes you can move, wardrobes you can open, cattle and chicken roaming about pastureland and coops, glowing gemstones that can be picked up, and torches you can damp or light with a touch.  Not to mention food: fish, boar meat, rabbit meat, cheese, apples, tomatoes, oranges, carrots, etc are found everywhere.  (Especially in houses.  You can steal anything as long as you aren't seen, which seems a bit odd for a savior type.)  Each of them is rated for an effect on your metabolism, too, so if you eat some boar meat, you can expect to regain lost hitpoints, as well as a temporary boost of two points to strength.  (The stomach isn't an infinite stacking location, though.  You can only consume a couple of items before getting ~stuffed.~)     There are fewer items to interact with outdoors, but that was the case as well with Ultima VII.  Don't expect to find Morrowind's 70+ herbs and plant species, though you will discover several different kinds of mushrooms that can be made into various useful potions.  The point in any case is that Divine Divinity is a fairly interactive world as 2D CRPGs go, much more so than the standard Black Isle Studios or Bioware game.  This gives its locales a more substantial texture, simulating to a limited extent a genuine 3D environment.  The attractive 16-bit graphics (up to 1024 x 768) help create atmosphere, as does the music, which changes to match the geographical area you're currently in.  (All except the title cut.  It features a wordless vocal that sounds like a mouse being choked to death.)   Like Ultima VII, too, Divine Divinity features a very large world.  Its four huge screens don't include the diversity of environment offered by the earlier game, but they do supply a playing field of vast dimensions.  Many CRPGs claim to furnish ~100+ hours of exciting gameplay~ but leave you wondering after a short while whether the public relations folks were running extremely fast clocks?25 hours, and you're done.  By contrast, I've been playing Divine Divinity for more than 60 hours, and I'm not in the endgame.      Ultima VII supplied three ingenious ways of allowing players to teleport vast distances through their enormous world.  Divine Divinity furnishes you with three, as well.  The first is a series of minor teleportal plates, usually placed to negotiate difficult terrain over short distances (such as the island dwellings in the Dwarven halls, separated by a river of bejeweled lava).  The second is a major teleportal plate system that links specific sights at vast distances.  You can't simply trigger these latter plates by stepping on them, but have to acquire empowering scrolls from a specific member of each of the seven major races in the game.  The third method is to use a pair of small pyramids that supply instant point-to-point travel when dropped.  It all works very well and smoothly, particularly the pyramids: running out of vitality and mana?  Just drop and activate a pyramid, sending you back to the other pyramid's location.  If you place one by the bed that was given to you free, upon arrival, you can sleep off the effects of battle.  Drop a few chests down there, and you can also store items you've come across but don't need, to sell later when you visit merchants.  As a result, accumulating gold is never a problem.   Interacting with Divine Divinity's world is simple.  To move, you right-click; to do anything else, you left-click.  If you left-click on a guard, he'll talk to you.  If you left-click on a potion, you'll pick it up.  If you left-click on that troll standing behind you right now, you'll attack it.  There are mini-screens you'll want to check that allow you to prime a skill or spell, study your active and finished quests, look at your inventory, your attributes, potions, a mini-map (with all enemies helpfully shown as red dots), etc, but these are quickly activated through the button bar at the bottom of the screen, or by using configurable hotkeys.   There are literally dozens of quests, most optional, available at all stages of the game.  You can both accumulate and track more than a dozen with ease, at any time.  (Note that even the questing in Divine Divinity resembles Ultima VII, as well?right down to a very few quests you're offered to bring lovers together, which once earned the latter game the satirical sobriquet, ~Ultima VII: The Love Boat.~)  Interestingly, the amount of experience you earn from a quest depends on your level, not the quest, itself; so there's no real need to focus on the more dangerous-sounding quests earlier in the game to get that really big experience boost.  You won't grow your character any faster by emptying a cursed abbey of its unpleasantly undead inhabitants than you will if you free up a little girl's cat accidentally locked in a merchant guild's archive.  This also hints at the variety of quests you'll receive, from simple deliveries to poisoning water supplies, to freeing hostages and accumulating the five parts of a lost set of Dragon Armor.  Some quests (like gathering the seven missing Council members) are also longterm, providing overarching themes to gameplay as you continue developing your character and exploring the land.   There's plenty of non-quest combat from native predators, the occasional gang of thugs, and territorial evil types who can't abide heroes marching in without a personalized invitation.  Larian deserves an appreciative nod (or a good, large mug of mead, if you want to really getting into the roleplaying thing), too, for making all the combat encounters environmentally logical.  You won't find skeletons hanging around with orcs in Divine Divinity to supply a greater challenge.  Battles have a feeling of being genuinely tied to the locale, rather than overlaid for experience fodder.  The placement of communities on the bigger map makes sense in most cases, though I don't understand why a thug encampment was positioned literally a few feet south of a well-patrolled merchant community.  You'd think somebody would notice all the heavily armored bandits right outside their windows?or that the developers would at least come up with a quest or an in-game explanation to throw at you.   Larian has chosen to provide containers that are like those in Ultima VII, too, and that's one feature I could have easily done without.  This is because the containers in the game have no segmented partitions?an admittedly artificial concept, but one that really enhances gameplay.  Who wants to open their inventory to find one large mess?  But that's exactly what you get in Divine Divinity.  Actually, it's five messes in your carried inventory; four of them used for armor, weapons, potions, spell charms/scrolls, while the fifth holds everything else and frankly looks it.  There's no scrolling in a container, either, so overlay is the only solution.  What's more, if you decide to stash stuff you come across in a chest anywhere in the game (and everything remains on the ground or in chests permanently), it becomes just like that closet your mother asked you to clean up twelve years ago, the one that hadn't seen the light of day in over eight years.  The one that still gives you occasional nightmares.  Yes, it's that bad.    ...To One Part Diablo   No, I'm sorry, but no matter how much publicity Blizzard paid for, Diablo isn't a roleplaying game.  A few stats don't substitute for real interaction with a fantasy universe, which is the hallmark of any RPG, paper-and-pencil or computerized.  Diablo and its descendents are highly linear action games?and a great deal of fun.  By contrast, one of the clever things Divine Divinity does is to wed the Diablo attributes/resistance system to a genuine CRPG.  You have four basic stats that affect everything important: your attack bonus and how much you can carry (strength), your offensive and defensive bonuses (dexterity), how much mana for magic-casting you've got (intelligence), and how many hitpoints your character has (vitality).  Each time your character makes a level you receive five points to distribute among those four attributes.  In addition, you'll find weapons, shields, and battlewear (helmet, body armor, necklace, boots, gloves, and two ring slots) that increases these qualities, and/or offers added resistance against various types of magical attack.     If the borrowings from the Diablo series aren't clear enough yet, you'll also find ~charms~ throughout the world that can be embedded in selected weapons, shields, etc.  These provide bonuses to resistances, improvements to attributes, etc.  Depending upon the item, it can hold anywhere from one to five charms.  As in Diablo, too, you'll find charms of different strength, and might want to sell the lesser ones you find while purchasing or discovering the major ones to use.   The character class system of Diablo is here made more flexible, so much so, that it's difficult to really speak of a clearly defined warrior, thief, or mage.  True, Divine Divinity employs that language for its three classes, though they refer to thieves as ~survivors.~  (You can choose from six characters when you start the game, but each member of a pair representing a class is alike, with minor skill variants.)  Classes are rated differently for their innate stealth, and the amount of vitality and mana increase that comes with making levels.  Each also possesses four ~paths~ of eight skills each, with each skill having five levels of increasing effectiveness.  Thus, the Way of the Wizard includes the path of Elemental Powers, where you can learn the Freeze spell?a really handy thing that not only administers some damage to an enemy, but temporarily paralyzes them.  On higher levels you pay more mana for the spell, but the paralysis effect lasts much longer.   The kicker to all this is that characters of any class may learn any skill.  The only restrictions are related to your character's level.  So you could create a warrior who's a genius at lockpicking, Freeze and alchemy, and great with a sword.  (I did.)  This rather makes the whole idea of four paths per class a bit ridiculous, though.  Perhaps the developers needed some manner of organizing their skills, even if they had no accurate reflection in game dynamics.  Or did they start development on the game with the intent of tying skills to classes, and only change this as Divine Divinity evolved further away from Diablo?   Visible evidence suggests the latter may be the case.  The demo portion of the game, which includes the beginning town, is far more Diablo-like in its structure than the rest of the product, with an extremely linear multi-level dungeon that even contains those repetitively unimaginative ~kill-all-the-monsters-then-kill-the-plotless-boss-monster~ setups.  The later dungeons are more varied in content, with a greater use of prop items to create atmosphere and for use in battle.  (You can drag barrels to open up or close off passages, for instance.)  Boss monsters have names you've heard elsewhere in the land, and may offer you dialog choices or at least a nice, megalomaniacal taunt before attacking.   Note that, just as in Diablo, you can play Divine Divinity's dungeons and outdoors combat zones as an action game, if you so wish, ignoring the spacebar/pause feature.  I don't, because there are plenty of spells, skills and weapons to use?and I don't feel it necessary to develop the kind of dexterity while having fun that's required to control heavy machinery.  But the point is, you can.  You can assign objects like potions, spells and weapons to function keys, and just sprint through dungeons as enemies come at you from all directions.  The option's there, and it's definitely a way of ratcheting up the visceral excitement level of Divine Divinity, if you wish.  The same realtime option is available in many other CRPGs but isn't as effective, because you're handling a party of four or more characters with far too many selectable effects to control on-the-fly.   War and Peace   But even if you pause regularly, the combat is pretty good.  Divine Divinity throws a variety of interesting enemy types at you, including fireball-throwing dragon fanatics, skeleton conjurers who summon up more of their kind, and orc wardrummers who can refresh the health of their troops with a single tap of the skins.  The large orc encampment is attractively detailed, and so is (in it charmingly festering way) the large, lizardman-invested sewer system beneath Verdistis.    Still, if you were making a nuisance of yourself invading the Assassins' Guild, you'd expect an avalanche of their best members to run for you at once, right?  Nothing like that happens here.  You're allowed to roam around, only meeting various ordinary assassins (who, in one of the worst graphical images of the game, look like bad imitations of Dracula) as you move from room to room.  Enemy AI is standard for a CRPG?which means that while everybody performs their roles more or less efficiently, no one has the commonsense to run away when badly hurt or call for backups.  Icewind Dale 2 is truly distinctive, in this respect.  Its orcs actually do run for backup troops.   But IWD2 is an extremely linear and combat-oriented game.  Divine Divinity allows your character instead to take time off and enjoy the pleasures of civilization.  You can get to know the local rural population bordering Rivertown, barter with a great jeweler and smithy in the Dwarven halls, and cozy up to an Elven lass whose father would just as soon introduce a poisoned arrow to your gluteus maximus.  You can go just about anywhere, and kill just about anything.  The game's sense of wide-open opportunities, as well as its truly contrasting modes of combat, exploration, conversation and merchant activities, really keeps things fresh and lively.   The Downside   There's much to enjoy in Divine Divinity, as my comments above show, but there are problems with the game.  Some of them are being addressed in patches, like a few occasional quest breakers, and freezing that occurs when you've quit and reloaded the game several times.  (Current solution: reboot before reloading Divine Divinity.)  Others can't be patched, though, and are rooted in the basic design.   For me, the worst fault is Divine Divinity's complete lack of originality.  The storyline, with its Great, Ancient Evil eventually destroyed by you, an average idiot, is only one example, and not too relevant.  (After all, most CRPGs have similar, unimaginative plots.  Aside from the very odd exception, like Planescape: Torment or Betrayal at Krondor, does anybody create a genuinely intriguing RPG plot for these games, rather than simply laying down an excuse to explore and Kill Things?)  The cliches unfortunately don't stop there.  Divine Divinity is riddled with predictable NPCs and events: Beer-guzzling dwarves and environmentally friendly elves fighting a war.  Orcs playing one group against another.  Graveyards filled with skeletons, zombies, and the occasional lich.  Plague-ridden poor, and aristocrats who lounge about ostentatiously and act like Monty Python caricatures.  Larian wasn't hedged in by AD&D requirements.  If they had wanted to set their game in a fantasy-inspired universe, they could have created some interesting cultures, and characters with complex motivations?perhaps even an over-arching theme, like the prejudice and fear of Ultima VI, which kept influencing so many encounters.  What we get instead in Divine Divinity is the usual fantasy rehash, served up lukewarm.   Then, too, some of the quest solutions are incredibly superficial.  I know: what do you expect from a CRPG?  But that doesn't mean all such quests have to be solvable by your average five-year-old.  For example, you're asked to assist a young lady get the goods on a corrupt administrator and merchant.  You accomplish this by opening the door to his house and looking in the main room, where, amazing to say, he has a book sitting in plain view to details all the ways he's stolen money over the years.  You don't even read the book to discover this; the description of it when you click on the thing reveals as much.  This is so condescending that it made me laugh out loud?not with the game (and it does have a good sense of humor), but at it.  There are too many examples of this in Divine Divinity.  There should have been at least a few challenges that involved using your mind, or at least assumed you had one.   I also don't like the fact that if you enter an area minus the quest for an item it contains, that item won't show up.  By my way of thinking, meticulous exploration should be rewarded.  If there's a prisoner being held by the orcs, he should be found in their stinking little prisons whether I got the Council quest yet or not; and if I haven't gotten it yet, he should simply thank me, go off to some inn for a little R&R and maybe a fling with an orc waitress, then show up in bed snoring his head off when I finally do the quest to discover his whereabouts, later.  I shouldn't see him residing in the same tiny cells I thoroughly investigated when all the orc legions were destroyed, some time ago.   Balance is excellent in keeping the game challenging as you advance, but not all the skills are equally effective.  Some are overpowered, like Deadly Gifts?which lets you drop inexpensive scorpion traps that morph into scorpion automatons, enormously well armored and capable of doing great damage over time.  Other skills are just as obviously underpowered, such as Flash Attack, which merely teleports you near a given target, and Feign Death, which allows you to fool your enemies into thinking you're dead.  A little more tweaking might have made a big difference, here.Divine Divinity is a very easy game to get into and enjoy.  It lacks anything memorable, like the party NPCs with minds and dialog of their own in Baldur's Gate 2, but it has atmosphere, tons of quests, and a great deal of variety to offer. Above all, it's plain fun to play, to develop your character and find ever-better weapons and armor, to face the foe around the next corner.  And who knows...?  With Bioware's assets tied up in light sabers and Black Isle Studios working on a game that has no strategic pause mode, perhaps Larian will step forward to carry the CRPG banner in the near future.  We could do a lot worse.", "date": "Oct 31, 2002"}
