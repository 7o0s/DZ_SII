While many of the ideas are creative and lend some interesting gameplay ideas to a space-based strategy setting where humans use blood-filled biological ships, there are a lot of simple issues and inconsistencies with interface, story and gameplay design.    The fiction behind Genesis Rising comes from an obscure European comic. After facing extinction, fractured human colonies united after the martyring of a unanimously respected leader. From there, the human existence turned into a long line of genetic alterations to themselves and the bionid ships they traveled in. Eventually humans reached the stars, grabbed hold, and shook out the other species on a religious crusade to dominate the universe.    The story in the game is set as the human empire sets out to acquire the Universal Heart, said to be the beginning of the universe. The heart just happens to be in the last (that's right, last) unexplored galaxy in the entire universe. Considering this is only 3000 years in the future, the premise is already pretty far fetched considering the incomprehensible numbers of stars and galaxies. What makes the premise of the game even more ridiculous is the human empire sending a tiny fleet in to find and secure the heart when, if they had conquered nearly the entire universe, they would probably have trillions of ships ram themselves down that galaxy's throat to choke anything living there out of existence. Instead, we get a small group of units putting around in the confining two dimensions of space that's become all the rage in space based RTS games.    The reason for the small number of units under your control is pretty apparent. Genesis Rising is all about adaptability in combat so the number of ships had to be small enough to micromanage.  If you were given control of hundreds, or even just dozens, of units, it would be pretty freaking hard to sort through all of the genes, attach them to the correct ship, and use them on the fly in battle. I understand that. It just is hard to sit with that considering the resources at the disposal of the universe-wide human civilization of this fiction. I would have preferred this type of gameplay in a story with a smaller scope instead of feeling hobbled the entire way through the game. Even the first cutscene shows hundreds of ships lined up for deployment. Talk about building up false expectations. Why not at least make the main character as part of a larger invasion fleet so battles could be bigger, or at least faked to look bigger.    The story is presented via cutscenes and conversations between principal characters. The cutscenes are pretty sad, both for the horrible voice acting and lack of ambient ship sounds, and the odd main character design. Why is a captain of a mothership wearing huge armor around on the bridge? It's pretty ridiculous. On the other hand, there are some cooler characters such as Vicar Juno and the Cerebrals who you'll meet throughout the campaign.   While the tactical action can be fairly fast-paced, this campaign can be pretty dull. While the types of missions can be varied in purpose, much of the game will see you and your fleet warping into an area with three to four enemy bases -- all with fleets -- and you'll have to take them out in order to complete your final goal. Because of the relative openness of space without more interesting terrain to develop a scenario, it's hard to get a feel that most of the missions are really much different than one another. There are some differences that will have players running errands, but travel times are long enough that it can get tedious when the payout isn't necessarily a very exciting battle.   In some cases, missions just seem to last and last and last with no end in sight. In fact, there's a mission that will keep looping forever until you get fed up and attack a different target not originally designated as a threat. I was almost sure I had encountered a bug that wouldn't let me finish the mission until I got angry enough for that myself. Not fun.   After the human campaign is over, you'll get a chance to play through some scenarios involving one of the alien races, which is nice because it's sad players aren't given more of a chance to check them out. Both the ice based and rock based aliens have different ways of producing units and different abilities that could have been exploited to better the game.   The tactical gameplay, whether in campaign or skirmish, offers up some interesting options for would be commanders. During the single player campaign, multiplayer, and skirmish, you'll will get to control the mighty bionid ships. These living organisms can be implanted with various genes that grant various abilities. They can range from basic weapons genes to booster genes that allow for speed increases or special abilities that are activated manually. Genes can be swapped out on the fly allowing for a pretty large range of tactics on the battlefield and great adaptability especially when considering the many varied genes at your disposal.     The problem is, it isn't easy enough to switch the genes out in the heat of battle to make adaptability in combat really feasible. The interface, while not horrific, is clumsy at best. Removing genes from a ship takes a certain amount of time and a new gene can only be added once a slot is empty. Micromanaging battle while trying to change micromange genes can become a nightmare. While the mechanic is still cool for some of the more puzzle-like aspects of the single player campaign, most changes are going to need to be made before battle rather than during the thick of it.    The sluggish gene interface wasn't the only presentation problem either. There are a rash of questionable decisions that I'm still scratching my head about. No mid-mission save which is especially annoying in the more difficult missions with conversation and cutscenes. No pause and play which would have helped with the confusion of battles. No adjusting options while playing or keybindings at all. No difficulty levels, which results in nearly the entire human campaign being too easy aside from the last couple of missions which are pretty challenging. The mini-map is terrible bordering on useless. The camera gets moved around by cutscenes leaving your ships in the thick of battle, which can be disastrous. Holding space to select special abilities brings up huge circles over each ship cluttering the battlefield. There's more, but those are the biggest offenders.   Metamorph tried to add some open-endedness to the campaign by allowing choice when it comes to both selectable missions and conversation in cutscenes. These choices provide a false sense of freedom however as you'll end up traveling everywhere and completing what amounts to a linear campaign (aside from the last mission which offers up different choices with different outcomes). The conversation strings in the odd cutscenes do allow for variation in gameplay. By choosing a peaceful or aggressive response, the characters will respond differently though most of the time the end result will be the same.    It's funny that so much choice would be presented to the player (whether it's useful or not) when this is another space-based RTS set on a 2D plane. I understand the need for it, using all three axis of space gets pretty damn confusing to many gamers. The main problem with being confined to 2D in this particular game is that units won't adjust along the Z axis at all to get around other units, which makes little to no sense. If you want to keep you from the confusion of full 3D movement, at least allow the AI to adjust for travel in a confined space.   Thankfully, the game looks very good. Not all of the textures are particularly impressive and the color palettes and styles aren't as fantastically alien as we've seen in other space-based RTSs like Homeworld, but what's there is certainly good. Ships in particular look about as disgusting as you would expect a blood filled spaceship to look. One of the best aspects of the visual design is the ability for the ships to actually grow new parts when genes are added. Seeing a huge gun grow out of the top of your ship is pretty fun and awesomely gross. While the ships, weapons effects, and environments are all good, the rest of the visual presentation is suspect with bland type, boring interface windows, and a GUI that has to be one of the ugliest I've seen in some time.Genesis Rising has a lot of great ideas that weren't implemented as well as they could have been. While adaptable living ships warping across the universe sounds like an awesome game, there were too many issues with interface, campaign pacing, and presentation to come out a winner. If you've been itching for some more space battles, Genesis Rising isn't a horrific choice, but we've definitely seen better in the past from games like Homeworld and Nexus: The Jupiter Incident.", "date": "Apr 5, 2007"}
