Many publishers want to capitalize on this, but very few of their games are worth looking at -- they;re just too simple or too similar. When Capcom announced that it was coming out with one, it seemed a bit late in the game to pull another chair up to the table, but make room indeed. What Capcom has with ESPN Poker Club is a challenging and fun Texas Hold Em title worth every penny you throw down for it.    The game allows you to create a new player and guide them through various locations in the world. As you progress through the tables, you'll unlock new, higher-stakes games, allowing you to amass quite a fortune, all while learning the basics and the advanced tricks of hold 'em poker. This is a great part of the game. In the real world, if you either play too aggressively, raising when you shouldn't, or if you play conservatively, constantly folding, you'd probably wind up losing a lot of money. However, the game manages help teach you how to play realistically, helping you figure out when to raise, fold and bluff -- important stuff for the high-stakes games.    The game rolls with solid AI, as your computer-opponents seem like they pick up on your gambling patterns. When you finally get a decent hand and you play aggressively, the others at the table will fold. If you try to lure them in by betting small, they'll only place small wagers, limiting the size of the pot. However, if you play consistently, with smart raises when you have a decent hand, you may be able to finagle your way into some huge winnings. The computer itself plays the game smart, bluffing, matching raises and making big raises of their own when they have something big, making things that much more difficult to deal with. It's not so difficult that you can't hang with it, but it does require a nice level of strategy, which is rather refreshing.    As you unlock new venues and matches to play, you can use your winnings to buy new items. These things are mostly vanity items that offer extra customizations for your avatar. You're even encouraged to buy them, as they can act as an extra bankroll of sorts. Should you ever run out of money in the game, you can just start over and create a new character, but a better option may be to sell the items that you've purchased. In addition to that, if you have more flair, it will allow you to show off your fortune during the online portion of the game. That's right, there's an online multiplayer component to this game.    This is online mode is perhaps the best part of ESPN Poker Club, as you'll actually be able to play against live opponents, adding an extra source of revenue for your character. Supporting up to eight players in a single match, this really adds value and re-play to the overall package. A turn-based system is used for the online game, with every player having a limited time to make their play. Despite the turn based system, the online game is so fast and responsive, it's almost as if it's actually a real-time game.     When testing the online portion of the game, there was little to no lag from when a player selected an action to the execution, which was shocking to say the least. If you're dropped during a game, you can rejoin at any time, popping back in as soon as the current hand is over. Should the game finish before you can rejoin, all the money in your pot will be put back into your overall total.    The biggest problem with Poker Club is that the matches tend to be relatively long. There are certainly short encounters, but some matches can last as long as 25 minutes. Should you want to play for a few minutes while you're waiting for an appointment, you more than likely won't be able to finish your game beforehand. If you're not worried about time and you'd like to play a match, then you'll have no problems. Aside from the one issue of length, ESPN Poker Club is one of the best poker titles on the market. Barring that one drawback, Poker Club is a solid choice for anyone who has a cell phone. The single player mode offers up a nice challenge to players of all levels while the online mode is surprisingly good, adding an extra level to the game, all with the bare minimum of lag, which is an impressive feat. Whether youre an expert or a beginner to the world of hold em poker, this title is a solid use of your money. So what are you waiting for? Shuffle up and deal!", "date": "Jan 13, 2007"}
