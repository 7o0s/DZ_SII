After the quiet arcade release in the US, the Zoanthrope transformation fighter never truly progressed enough to lead the changing fighters of the time, and despite the growing number of combos and added animals to transform into over the years, Hudson's once interesting series has pretty much remained at a standstill.   Bloody Roar 4 offers enough changes and alterations to differentiate this one from Bloody Roar 3, but Hudson hasn't given the game the dedicated depth or fine precision of Sega's latest Virtua Fighter or the intense charisma, combat stylization or playability of Namco's Soul Calibur series, either. What it looks like we have with Bloody Roar 4 is profits. Here's a game that's brought to the US because it's already made its money in Japan and with little cost expenditure, bringing it to the US should translate into gravy income, even if it's only a little.    Sound a little cynical? Well, maybe you should play Bloody Roar 4 and see for yourself (you should probably rent first), but if you are interested, don't expect anything of the caliber (pun intended) of Soul Calibur, Tekken, Virtua Fighter or Dead or Alive. But you will get a good amount of speed and graphical flair, some cool-looking beasts, and some of the worst dialog and localization this side of Mars.    Gameplay  Bloody Roar 4 is a 3D fighting game with a hook -- the transformation of your chosen character into a beast or creature, but in any case, a ~Zoanthrope~ of some kind. Several of the series' long-term fighters are still around, such as Bakuryu, the Mole, Alice, the Rabbit, and Shenlong, the Tiger, and this time newly added characters include Nagi the Spurious, Ryoho and Mana, Jenny the Bat, Reiji, the Crow, and a few others. Each fighter has his or her own special look and creature design, fighting style, and set of beast drive attacks. If you've played any of the previous games, you'll recognize these beasts, slightly remodeled and upgraded for this new game.    The storyline is quite humorous and silly on its own, but the poor localization brings it to a new height, with odd sections of silence, moving mouths with no words coming from them, and jokes that stand still like a fork in Chunky Soup. Utilizing the concept of Gaia, Hudson created a world in which life forms progress through natural selection, as creatures that might have made it through the natural selection if they had continued to evolve, but didn't, called the Unborn.    After the so-called XGC (X-Genome Code) Incident and the riots, earthquakes and disturbances that followed, the people of Earth, blaming the entire thing on the calamitous Stone Soul, finally calmed down. But despite the Stone Soul having been locked away, riots and earthquakes boiled up again. There is a lot of guessing to be done to follow the story, but the backstory is really just a 2D prop for the beasts to exist. What's important is that you get to hear the inane dialog and fight as a wild mole, rabbit or chameleon.    This 3D fighter brings a few wrinkles to the fighting table, with the manual ability to transfer energy from the Life Gauge meter to the Beast Gauge, a neat addition that gives players more flexibility in their preferred playing style, and more time in the more advantageous Beast form. The new characters add a more distinct aerial dimension to the game, with straight juggles and juggles off the breakable walls providing more punishment to the already ridiculously long combos. And like Bloody Roar 3 (but originated in the Dead Or Alive series), players can unleash a devastating hit that punches an opponent through the invisible walls into an entirely different arena altogether. Among other additions, such as new modes of play, the Career mode offers an immense amount of unlockable features. By playing and beating the Career mode, players gain monetary units to unlock and purchase what appears to be hundreds of pieces of artwork, dozens of offensive and defensive moves, and new levels.   Bloody Roar 4 is still pretty much a basic 3D fighter, with little innovation, or any kind of spark of creative life -- or special qualities -- that differentiate it from the pack. Obviously, there's the whole beast transformation dynamic, which is essentially the same as it was from the beginning. This year's set of beasts (or remakes of beasts) appears to resembles popular anime and manga -- see Xion's similarity to The Guyver, the anime and manga.    But there are solid nuggets to take away from the game. What Bloody Roar does well is to give players a superb set of basics. The characters are amazingly fast and responsive. The collision detection is tight and consistently good, and everything moves with a quick clip. The motion-capture work never gets in the way. The game's basic are like any other fighter, with a decent amount of kicks, attacks, and combos; and when combined with the Beast form attacks, which enhance or even transform weak attacks into monster attacks, the move set is more than healthy. Players familiar with Tekken will recognize a familiar set of combo attacks.      The moves and combinations, however, never feel terribly original nor inspired. The combos are relatively stale, and even though you can connect strings of them in a staggered state, one never gets the feeling that there's much depth to the gameplay other than dialing in combo after combo. The fighting system does an OK job of working in throws, which are pretty ordinary, and a poor job of employing counters, if you can call them that. Here, a cancellation of a move, or an enemy attack, is substituted for a real counter.    Hudson's game is really an offensive game designed to be a hyper-button mashing good time. No doubt there is depth here, knowing the characters' moves and timing the transfer of energy from human to beast form -- and more importantly, knowing when to transform or not. And there is certainly a good amount of fun experiencing the huge litany of moves unleashed in the game's longer (we're talking 50-plus hits) combos in Beast form, but Bloody Roar 4 is a game that still relies on speedy, flashy outfits and wild looking beast models, than innovation, depth or originality.    The game also presents a healthy amount of modes (Arcade, Time Attack, Versus, Training, Survival, Com. Battle, Sparring, and Career), but there is very little substantial difference between say, the Sparring mode and Training, or Vs. Com and Arcade. Naturally, the Arcade mode is the meat of the game, giving players a slice of the bigger story from their character's perspective and it's the mode wherein you beat the game properly, with credits flashing and all. But ever here there is something significant to complain about. There are a few sub-bosses prior to the final boss, and you must beat the final boss in one round -- or else you must start the game from the beginning again. We love a challenge, oh yes we do, but that's just a little heavy-handed.    The 18 plus characters, with five locked at the start, are also well worth checking out. The roster includes Nagi the Spurious, Yugo the Wolf, Bakuryu the Mole, Gado the Lion, Shenlong the Tiger, Stun the Insect, Uriho the Cat, Alice the Rabbit, Hion the Unborn, Ryoho and Mana, Busuzima the Chameleon, Jenny the Bat, and Reiji the Crow. There are three costumes per character at the start and 11 stages, plus locked ones. The levels are also uninspired and lackluster.    Graphics  As mentioned above, Bloody Roar 4 is a fast, fluid and pretty game. The pretty part, however, is not located in the backgrounds (which, like I said before, leave much to be desired), but in the speed and fluidity of the characters themslves. These characters blaze across the screen, instantly moving at your beck and call. The Beast Transformations are gilded with pulsing illuminations and blazing particles and the breaking wall animations are handled with good cameras and are followed with even better looking secondary arenas.     The beasts themselves are a little old by now, but they are well animated, even when they're goofy looking, like with Jenny the Bat and Reiji the Crow. Busuzima the Chameleon is still weird looking and therefore unusual to inspect, and while he's never been my favorite to play, he's always worth a look.   The menu systems are very basic and dull, looking like old scheme IBM menus. The plain blue and black menu blocks and linear construction are entirely unembellished.    Sound  If you've played games for a while and enjoy the occasional vocal ridiculousness, then Bloody Roar 4 is for you. The voice acting is simply atrocious. I don't mean that as an anime snob or a film critic (because I am neither), I mean they're just plain miserable from a simple layman's perspective. The localization is so poorly handled it's just fun to see what awesomely illogical and chaotic conversation these characters are going to have. Mouth animations are entirely unsynchronized with the words; there are ill-placed indelible silences between characters; and the overly long cutscenes seem to emphasize the silences and awkward camera angles rather than the puzzling words themselves. Sometimes (OK, most times) the words actually make no sense at all, as if a failing localization manager just gave up and flew the building, filling in the blanks with random words before fleeing the job in despair.  Bloody Roar 4 is a decent 3D fighting game with enough modes of play, a big enough roster, and a deep enough fighting system to please a hardcore gamer for a day or two. For the casual gamer unfamiliar with the series, the unique character designs are interesting enough, especially with their Japanese-like flair for sexual (and animal) ambiguity. Still, the stagnant ongoing series is definitely in the second tier of fighters, way below Sega's, Namco's and Temco's seminal series, and it's seriously getting old and tired.It's still a better-than-average game, but the lack of depth and subtlety and the emphasis on the offensive, rather than the defensive, puts this squarely two notches below the best in the genre. If you're super hard-up for a fighting game of any kind and you simply can't play enough of the handful of great fighters already on PS2 (Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution, Soul Calibur 2, etc.), than Bloody Roar 4 is at least worth a rent.", "date": "Mar 8, 2004"}
