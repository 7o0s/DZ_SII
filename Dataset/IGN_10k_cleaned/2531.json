The handheld version of the extreme sports series exceeded our expectations and became one of the must-have games in the GBA's game library. The development team responsible for THPS2 on the Game Boy Advance went straight to work on the next sequel...and while the technical novelty has already run its course with the first game on the system, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 for the Game Boy Advance improves on nearly every element established in the GBA's launch title...and it's still an amazingly fun game design and a highly recommended title for the handheld. Features Seven available parks 13 available skaters Create-a-skater option Battery save Link cable support for four players (hot seat and multiple cartridge support) Only for Game Boy Advance  If you've played Tony Hawk 2 on the handheld (and shame on you if you haven't), Tony Hawk 3 for the Game Boy Advance retains 99% of the same gameplay elements, while moving the series with more of everything. Larger levels, additional skater tricks, multiplayer support, create-a-skater mode, altering environments, interactive objects, collectable skateboards...just to name a few. The awesomely addictive game design hasn't missed a beat, though, as you're still challenged to accomplish tasks to advance through the game's six parks (and one additional one if you're good enough). This game is still a great title to quickly power up, score a few quotas in a park, and put away for later. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is based around the console versions of the same name...so the designers of the GBA game created skateparks around established THPS3 locations including The Foundy and its pools of molten metal, the creepy Suburbia, the Airport, Rio, earthquake-prone Los Angeles, and the vibrant Tokyo park. The GBA game also includes the newly-added ~revert~ move that helps link vert ramp tricks with grinds, manuals and other board tricks...meaning that, with the revert move, you can now create trick combos that'll blow the THPS2 scores right out of the water. Skill points are now collected instead of purchased, so you'll have to keep an eye out for the hovering icons to snag during your thrashing session in order to build your character's attributes.  Along with a laundry list of additional game design elements, Vicarious Visions, the handheld development team who brought Tony Hawk 2 to life last year, reworked its already-incredible hybrid 3D/2D engine established in the original GBA game...where the first game utilized basic shaded polygons for the motion-captured character sprites, Tony Hawk 3 features fully texture-mapped character and skateboard models. The fluid motion of the skater's hundreds of animation sequences is enhanced by the additional detail all over his body. Skaters can have tattoos, shirt logos, hair...and, yes, even faces. The massive levels can, and will, change during play...draining the lava out of the Foundry will open up a couple of skateable pools. Even with all the detail and enhancements added to the game engine, it's just as fast and smooth as the original game released last year. Optimized code is a wondrous thing.  And thanks to the texture-mapped characters, the developers were able to add in one of the missing game options from Tony Hawk 2: Create-a-Skater. Though cartridge size is obviously limited, the development team give access to at least a dozen different choices each of head, shirts, pants, shoes, and shoes, as well as shirt logos and arm and leg tattoos. And even though you only have one Create-a-Skater to use during his career, you can create four different versions of him for a bit of personal expression. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 also includes excellent multiplayer modes, both using a single system and link cable for up to four players. Horse can be played on one system via Hot Seat play, with each player performing a string of combos to score more points than the opponents. Through link play, up to four skaters can play ~Tag~ (skate away from the one who's ~it~), King of the Hill (grab the crown from the other person...sort of Tag but in reverse), and a mode where you simply score more points than the other players. Unfortunately, the popular Graffiti mode from the console game didn't make the cut...most likely because of technical restraints. The multiplayer mode is done very well, with a few programming cheats to make sure that slowdown is cut to a minimum;  opposing players ~flicker~ to reduce the need for processing power, for example...it's a slight distraction, but if you understand how much this game is pushing the system, you'll understand the need for this slight graphics tweak.  If there was anything to complain about, it's that the game's fixed angled perspective still makes it difficult to tell where your character is in relation to vert ramps, halfpipes, grind rails, and, most importantly, objects. And because the levels are four times larger than in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 on the handheld, there are more ledges, rails, and objects that make the perspective look all screwy to people not practiced on these new parks. It takes a good few sessions through each of the levels to learn just where everything is.  Tony Hawk 3 is an incredible package, and it's a lot deeper than you're led to believe. The designers have put in a ton of extras that are unlocked as you successfully go through its career mode several times. Extra characters, parks, and gameplay modes are tucked away in the game, hidden as an incentive to learn and master the controls and skateparks in this GBA title.  The ~gee whiz~ factor isn't nearly as overwhelming in the sequel, but that doesn't mean that Tony Hawk 3 isn't a marvel in itself. The game is tighter, longer, and more challenging than its predecessor, with more elements to enjoy, both in single and multiplayer modes. Don't miss this one.", "date": "Mar 6, 2002"}
