The name of the game is The Mummy Returns, it's the sequel to The Mummy and the movie starred WWF superstar, The Rock, whose catch phrase was, ~Finally, The Rock has come back to...~ Funny, eh? Okay, maybe it's not quite as clever as I had hoped, but it sure beats the hell out of the only other opening for this review that I could come up with --~Developed by Blitz Games and published by Universal Interactive Studios, The Mummy Returns is a 3D action game based on the highly-successful movie of the same name that raked in more than $200 million at the box office.~  Gameplay The game follows the same basic plot line of the movie, but with a twist. In addition to having the ability to play as Rick O'Connell, the game's hero who wants to rescue his son, Alex, resuscitate his wife, Evy, and defeat The Scorpion King to save the world, players can also choose to let their evil side loose and play as Imhotep whose ultimate goal is to raise up The Scorpion King and then use his army to rule the world.   This, however, is one of only a few cool things about the game. While both Rick and Imhotep have wealth of attacks at their disposal, as Rick can use guns, punch, kick and even pick up swords from fallen foes and Imhotep can use a variety of useful spells in addition to the hand-to-hand combat, the fighting in the game feels clunky, a bit haphazard, and generally uninteresting. Even though there's an auto-aim for the projectile and direct attacks, you'll still find that the character will punch or kick in the wrong direction much too often. The lack of a Zelda-like lock-on really hurts here and the general combat is made even worse by the fact that you'll find there's an overabundance of hits taken from enemies that are off-screen.  It was definitely a good idea to use a screen-relative control scheme, where the character moves in the direction pressed, as it better suits the game's action feel, but players will encounter some problems with the control because of some other game design decisions. First, the fact that you can't jump unless you're in a jump area combined with the fact that jump and climb use the same buttons slows down the pace of the game. Besides, since you can't jump from anywhere and it's possible to walk off ledges, you might encounter some areas where you fall off a ledge because you run to an area that isn't in the designated area that you can jump from, even though you should've been able to make the jump.  It's too bad that the game has these issues, as there are some good things about the game. The story, while based on the critically panned movie, actually works well in the scope of a videogame. Likewise, the ability to be ~Good~ or ~Evil~ is welcome and the variety in the locales, weapons, and enemies is decent enough. It just doesn't work with the mentioned control and combat issues.  Graphics Much like the gameplay, the visuals in The Mummy Returns offers a mixed bad of both good and bad, with the negative outweighing the positive in the end. The different character models look fine enough and there are a lot of nice lighting effects you'll see throughout the game's varied levels, but that's where the goodness ends. There's a lot of slowdown in random areas, the character animation seems more reminiscent of a 32-bit PlayStation game than something befitting of a next-generation system, and the backgrounds are comprised of some ugly, low-resolution textures with a lot of seaming problems.  Sound The music and sound is pretty generic stuff. Not bad really, it's just that the music is far from memorable and the sound effects are just completely standard videogame fill. The only real noteworthy aspect of the sound is the voice acting, but this definitely isn't a positive. The characters don't move their mouths when the words are spoken, the lines aren't delivered well and the overall presentation just isn't all that special.  There's honestly no reason to buy this game. If you're a fan of the movie just go buy the DVD, because this game really isn't worth playing. It's actually better than The Mummy on PlayStation, but that's not really saying much. The bottom line is that there are a lot of must-have games being released on PlayStation 2 right now and this isn't one of them.", "date": "Oct 15, 2001"}
