Bundled up in their woobie of choice, snuggled into a soft cushy chair, and downloading freeware games for hours on end is practically a Windows right of passage. Unlike the console crowd, where games must be purchased from stores or willing pals, PC fanatics can grab an entire library of games without even leaving their desk. And while it's true that the majority of free software out there bites the proverbial ass, every once in awhile there's a diamond in the rough that makes it all worth the time and effort. And so, for the first time since SEGA's Christmas Nights giveaway from a few years ago, the console faithful have been given a chance to discover a diamond of their own and enjoy a free game that doesn't suck.   Yes friends, with Tremor Entertainment's newest puzzler SEGA Swirl, you too can enjoy a light-hearted gaming session free of charge. Now, before most of you begin to span the globe, demanding your free copy from unsuspecting shop clerks, keep in mind that you may already have it. The title is included in the March 2000 issue of the Official SEGA Dreamcast Magazine and in spankin' new Dreamcast systems right out of the box, so you don't have to look too far. If you didn't buy your Dreamcast recently, however, and leave all your reading material to the web, then you had better be prepared to start calling in some favors.   Sometimes  The premise behind Swirl is actually very simple; clear a board of different colored swirling blocks and move on to the next level. However, in what can best be described as ~Reverse Tetris~ your goal is accomplished by starting with a full screen of blocks instead of an empty one. Definitely slower paced than Columns or Klax (some of the best times you could have asked for on the SEGA Genesis), the easily accessible game-board provides more of a challenge than you would think.   In order to empty your screen of its pesky swirling pieces, you have to match the different colors with their appropriate friends. Once you swat a few of them out of the way, playing the game with authority becomes second nature. Not to say that it's easy, not by any means. Even if you can chain enough colors together to clear the screen in a few minutes, it gets harder and harder with every stage.   Despite the caveman graphics and equally geriatric sound, Swirl's replayability still shines through. To help break up the monotony of playing the same thing over and over again, there is a myriad of different ways you can dive into the action. You can choose to play against the computer or up to three buddies; you can race against the clock or throw time out the window and just play for the hell of it; there's even an option to try and meet preset goals in order to advance to the next level -- it's easily the most challenging aspect of the game, and you'll spend hours on it.   Of course, what everyone wants to know is how does the included Email play fare? Well, it's a little slow (since you have to wait until your opponent sends off their information before you know what to do next), but it gets the job done. A terrific way to meet people and find opponents on those lonely Thursday nights, this limited approach to Internet activity is just a hint of what's to come. I will admit that the connect times could be improved on, but that's just nitpicking. Perhaps in a sequel we can play against our foes in real time.While SEGA Swirl may not be the greatest puzzle game of all time, there is plenty here that will keep you busy in-between those hardcore Soul Calibur and DOA2 jam sessions. Relaxing and a breeze to play, (that zero balance price tag helps a lot too) you can't go wrong with this, ~the little game that could.~", "date": "Mar 18, 2000"}
