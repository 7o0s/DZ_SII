You know, the one where I go at length about how great this series is and how we've all spent lots of time playing it? I'll also skip over the bit where we talk about how much we've been anticipating this game or how we had childish fights to see who would get to review it. I'm not going to bother to do any of that because you've undoubtedly read it all before (or, if you haven't, perhaps not even cared about it in the first place). So let's get right to the review.  (You can check out the game in action alongside our commentary in our full video review.)  For those who don't know, Raven Shield is the latest in the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six series. These tactical shooters are a harsh reality to the Quake crowd. Leading an elite hostage rescue (bomb defusing/tango killing/world saving) team through a series of high-risk missions isn't for everyone. One shot can end your life here and, since you can't ever save your game during a mission, this can be quite frustrating to the more twitch-minded player. For the rest of us, it can be a welcome change of pace from the hectic action of games like Serious Sam.  Raven Shield is pretty damn awesome. Not only does it continue the series' tradition of intense realism and the unforgiving consequences of close-quarters combat, it does it better than any of the previous titles in the series. The main changes for the game are largely graphical or mere matters of convenience, but the cumulative effect of the new technologies and design concepts create an experience that's as fun, if not as revolutionary, as the first game in the series.  Though the team has made some headway in the area of story, the actual plot of Raven Shield is still fairly thin and to some extent unnecessary. Since the series was spawned from a novel, it's been somewhat strange that more effort hasn't been made to craft a more meaningful story arc to tie the whole game together. Still, the nature of special operations work tends to work against any personal involvement in characters and situations.  This time around things are a bit better, but I still didn't find myself caring too much about the actual story elements in the game. There's a tighter continuity here in terms of events but you never really feel like a part of the story. Sure, it means something when one of your guys dies or is wounded, but it's never as if there's any personal stake in what's going on.  We do get a few cutscenes to highlight certain missions but even these are too few and too generic to really serve as more than a chance to show off the graphics engine. The one exception to this is the opening cutscene. It breaks from the mindless action montage that opened the previous games and actually sets up a situation that carries through the end of the game. But although the story begins in 1945, there's little sense of discovery or even consequence in what follows.  I found the enemy AI to be quite challenging but not unfairly so. Though there's no equivalent of the sniper mission from Rogue Spear, the enemies here put up quite a fight and will have you scrambling as you get yourself in to and out of danger. The enemies even scramble a bit. I was quite impressed with the handful of enemies that managed to run from an unfair fight and set up ambushes for us farther down the hallway or street.  Things like footsteps or breaking glass can cause enemies to come running, sometimes smartly, sometimes not. (I remember one instance where a terrorist thought it was a good idea to go check out a recent grenade explosion.) Every now and then you'll see enemies do something ridiculous, like standing in a corner with their back to the room, but for the most part, they behave somewhat intelligently.  The friendly AI is pretty good about providing 360-degrees of cover. The tailing member of your squad is frequently checking behind you to ensure that you're not taken out by an enemy to your rear. They're quick on the trigger and call out the targets in a way that's surprisingly helpful, more so at least than in the previous games.  Pathfinding can still be a real pain from time to time but, thankfully, almost all of the collision problems that have plagued the series have been all but eliminated. No longer will you see heads and feet sticking through doors. The odd effect still seems to spill over across strange barriers (like smoke from grenades passing through walls), but it happens so rarely and has so little effect on gameplay that it's hardly worth mentioning.      One of the coolest new features of the game is the opportunity to order your team members to open doors for you, toss grenades around and even clear entire rooms for you. Simply point your reticle at a door and hit the ~action~ key to pull up a radial menu of commands. Move the mouse over the option you want and click fire to issue the order. I've even taken to ordering my guys in to clear a room while I sit out in the hall and watch their rear. (Oh, grow up.) The only real drawback of this system is that I occasionally had to order my team to form up behind me again.  Pathfinding still causes a few headaches, but not nearly as many as in Rogue Spear. Guys still seem to get hung up on strange parts of the environment but not nearly to the extent that they did in previous games. Unfortunately there's still a real problem switching among characters when under fire. Naturally this ought to be a problem, but it tends to creates more trouble than it should. When the first member of your squad falls, it's usually a good idea to wait to switch to the second member until they've taken care of the enemy. That slight hesitation when you switch and the frequent problems reorienting yourself to the action mean that, if he is in danger, the next guy you switch to will also die. Realistic, maybe, but hardly fun.  The levels are both realistic and fun. They're still filled with the same clutter that populated levels in the previous games but somehow it all seems much more natural this time around. Sure, there are plenty of crates sitting around and slabs of beef hanging from the ceiling, but it makes a bit more sense within the levels than I remember from Rogue Spear. The levels are very natural with lots of cover and blind corners. I also like that there's a greater range of heights in the levels. The series has always had a wonderful relationship with the architectural phenomenon known as the ~balcony~ but now there are loads of raised platforms and walkways that really add a vertical dimension to the fighting. It's not unusual to find three levels of height all within a single space.  And the range of levels is quite nice, if a bit predictable. Taken by itself, the game offers numerous and varied locations. The only real issue that hampers your enjoyment of these diverse locales is that you've seen them all before in previous Rainbow Six games. And you'll even see a few from this game more than once as you progress through the game. For whatever reason it seems like the franchise hasn't yet shook its fetish for stock locations like airports, shipyards, banks, mansions, etc. Perhaps this is more of a complaint for the terrorists who continue to choose these locations in real life. But, not knowing any terrorists, I'll just pass the fault on to Ubi Soft.  By Red Storm's own admission planning is still the weakest part of Rainbow Six. While it still leaves a lot to be desired, it's been improved in some significant ways. Character and outfit selection still uses the same principles but in a much more intuitive way.  All of the information of weapons, characters, and special equipment is presented in a single screen that's quite easily navigated. Better still, the performance data for the weapons is displayed while you're making your selection.  Things fall apart a bit when you actually have to plan your routes through the environment and issue orders for particular locations. It's handled much more conveniently than in prior games, with things like individual go-codes and actions (breach, flashbang, etc.) having their own accompanying graphics. My favorite feature of the mission planner is the small window that displays the view from each of your waypoints. It makes it much easier to see what your team is going to see and helps stop you from positioning your teams too far beyond corners or on the wrong side of cover. Best of all, the default, pre-loaded plans can completely eliminate any involvement with the planning interface. If you don't particularly care, the default plans work pretty well.  During the mission, the waypoints are displayed on the main game screen, rather than in a small radar window at the bottom. This helps you keep your eye on the action in front of you while still leading you on your path through each level. Waypoints you've skirted around don't disappear like they used to, but you can cycle through those ahead of you to get back on track. (Strangely you can't cycle backwards through those you haven't cleared yet.) Things like heartbeat contacts are also displayed on the main game screen now, letting you gauge the height and position of your opponents relative to the actual environment.  As for the missions themselves, I've always been partial to the simple ones -- the ones that only require you to go in to an area and kick lots of ass. Those that involve hostage rescue are nice (as long as you know what you're shooting at) and the few bomb defusing scenarios are cool. The trick in each of these is to take down every enemy that so much as glances in your direction. Whether by killing hostages or releasing deadly nerve gas, the terrorists are sure to end your chances of success as soon as they possibly can. In any case, you can't get much better than the plain old terrorist hunt.      I still don't know why the team includes the obligatory stealth level. Forcing the player to sneak around and not get caught is fine in principle, but it seems to go against everything that makes this series standout -- namely the merciless and absorbing assault on groups of terrorists. Some may think it makes a nice change of pace, but it tends to throw off the rhythm of the game to suddenly switch to a completely different style of play. I understand these are covert ops, of course, but the tone of the game is oriented in a very different direction. Thankfully there's only one pure stealth mission here. If you're on the ball you can finish it in just a few minutes and get back to the louder stuff.  Multiplayer has always been a high point of the series and Raven Shield continues the tradition. For the most part, the modes that we used to love are present and intact in this new version. Players have long been asking for the opportunity to play more terrorist-themed missions in a head-to-head team format. Red Storm had always claimed that they would never allow players to take the part of terrorists. And while that sense of morality is somewhat preserved here, there are now a few team-based games that give one side a bomb or hostage and tasks the other team with eliminating it.   While it was never a terrible-looking game, Rainbow Six hardly got by on its graphics. That's changed with Raven Shield. It's far and away the best-looking of the games. Nevermind the great new effects. The image burn from flashbangs or the smearing of tear gas clouds is cool enough, to be sure, but what really get me are the basic things -- things like character models and architecture. They've improved considerably in this series and help postpone the realization that this is just a game. Additionally, the new rag doll effects of the models are much more lifelike. While they're still not on par with similar effects in titles like Unreal II, it's great not to see bodies as stiff as boards sticking out over staircases and the like.  Sound is also improved over the previous versions. There's a greater variety and a touch of unpredictability to the dialogue, which can be a big help when you're restarting a mission for the eighth time. Your own teammates keep you up to date on whatever is going on around them. The most effective sounds are those you hear at a distance. Walking around a giant mansion and suddenly hearing gunfire erupt on the other side of the level really gets your blood going.  Of course, the best part of the audio presentation is Bill Brown's score. Instantly recognizable to any gamer who bothers to notice such things, he's as much a part of the series as someone like Ding Chavez or Dan Bogart. Simply put, this a fine tactical shooter that belongs, not just on the shelf of fans of the genre, but actually on their hard drive. It's smart, unforgiving and genuinely exhilarating. My enjoyment of this series has always rested more on the concepts than the graphics. So it stands to reason that, now that the graphics are equivalent to most other titles in the action genre, I'd enjoy this one best of all. To some extent that's true. While I think the overall approach works here, I'm forced to admit that the changes made to the game are merely iterative rather than innovative. As such, and even with the welcome new features, this game didn't hold any surprises for me.As that was a big part of the original Rainbow Six's appeal, it makes sense to emphasize continuity over change. And any good publisher isn't going to run the risk of breaking a franchise like this. Still, with the new developer, I expected a few more surprises. In the end, I'm left with a damn fine game but one that never does anything I didn't expect from it. That sense of discovery was a big part of Ghost Recon, for instance.That's the real deciding factor. If you like the series (and you should, assuming you enjoy intelligent games that don't skimp on the action), then you'll like Raven Shield; you just won't find much that's really new about it. Even so, having a chance to relive the excitement of Rainbow Six is a much prettier, more convenient setting is more than enough recommendation for me.", "date": "Mar 20, 2003"}
