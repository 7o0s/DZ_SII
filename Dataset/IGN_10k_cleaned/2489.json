And since I really enjoyed the PC version, I was convinced that the PlayStation version would be just as good... and it was.  Set in the not too distant future, MDK puts gamers behind the sniper helmet of Kurt Hectic, a mercenary out to save Earth. Armed with a sniper-rifle helmet and some other cool items, your mission is to prevent the evil Stream Riders from turning the Earth's population into mindless slaves. Sounds good so far.  I hate to compare PC versions of games to their PlayStation counterparts, but MDK is an exception. This game moves just as fast as the PC version, it has all the levels, including a few bonus ones, and the sniper helmet is still 'pixel-perfect'. In fact, you can still knock a monster's eye out with your crazy sniper helmet like the PC version -- and it's just as bloody to.  Sure, this game looks and plays like the PC version, but it also possesses a ton of new additions that the PC version failed to include. The music has been completely redone, analog compatibility has been added for smoother gameplay, and my favorite, a different game ending has been put in as well.  The only complaint I had in this game is the random slip in framerate during some levels. Perhaps it's the real-time loading. But beside that, this is an awesome game and I would recommend it to anyone who favors action-packed first person shooters.  Jay Boor", "date": "Nov 22, 1997"}
