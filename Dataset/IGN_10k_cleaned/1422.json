Bar a few shortcomings, NCAA Football '98 has to be one of the strongest football games out to date.  This game has all the necessary options. In fact, there isn't a thing you can't do in this game. With all 112 college teams at your disposal, you can recreate the greatest rivalries, including a  Cal Vs. Stanford game. It also features exclusive rights to the Orange, Fiesta, and Sugar Bowls.  Not to spend too much time on the options, but the one that particularly caught our eye was the Dynasty Mode. This incredible mode allows you to play season-to-season, witnessing the growth of your team by recruiting and molding new freshman talent to replace your senior players that eventually graduate.  However, when it comes to gameplay, Football 98 doesn't offer anything new. In fact, it plays and moves similarly to EA's Madden series. The play-pick interface may possess all the top plays, but the on-field players remain sprite-based and still move like the classic, but out-dated, Madden series.  Although this game may play like Madden, NCAA Football '98 still seperates itself by adding all the stadiums, all the crowd noises, and an Alma Mater soundtrack filled with your favorite college fight songs.  So if you like college football, or you just want a solid football game, NCAA Football '98 will definitely keep your cleats muddy.  Jason Boor", "date": "Aug 6, 1997"}
