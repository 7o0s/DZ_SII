They are a highly trained group of soldiers specializing in anti-terrorist combat missions.  They get in and they get out and are capable of causing hellacious amounts of damage in those short amounts of time. This is definitely ripe territory for a computer game and NovaLogic has known this for years now releasing the first Delta Force game in the fall of 1998. NovaLogic's follow up to Land Warrior acheived little success due to very choppy framerates and very pixilated voxel terrain. Now NovaLogic is back and trying to do the series right with an updated graphics engine that supports 3D acceleration. The engine certainly does its job; the game runs very smooth. Unfortunately, NovaLogic seems to have spent too much time on the acceleration issue and not enough time on more important AI and realism issues.   Delta Force: Land Warrior takes its name from a project that is currently being developed and utilized by the U.S. Army. It basically provides more information for ground troops in the form of smarter weapons and real time tactical information, but you can read more of the details here. DFLW borrowed a couple of things from the program besides the name. The first and most important, is the GPS, which is a heads-up system that will give real time information on enemy position on the field. This is an extremely important addition to your screen as it provides you with all of the info you could need on troop movements, building locations, waypoints, and targets. You'll be using this a whole lot in the game. The second most important addition from the program is the OICW, a powerful new assault rifle that not only allows for long distance sniping, but also has a high-explosive grenade capable of exploding and launching shrapnel that can hit targets behind obstacles.   The graphics are certainly improved over the Delta Force 2. The terrains are very nice and as expansive as the voxel technology allows. There are no more huge pixels either so the terrain is nice and smooth. Add this with the ability to use 3D acceleration and you've got a pretty smooth game with fairly slick terrain. The addition of large, seamless indoor environments also adds more interest and variety to a largely outdoor combat game.   While the character, vehicle, and building models aren't up to par with many of the games available on the market today they still do the job plenty satisfactorily. Unfortunately the animations can leave them looking a bit blocky and lifeless at times. For example, the transitions between standing and prone positions are virtually instantaneous and choppy with under par crawling, running and swimming animations. They do the job, but barely in some cases. Deathimations, however, are decent most of the time. The problem with the deaths is in another area altogether. Collision and clipping problems are everywhere in this game. Not since EverQuest have I seen so many bodies poking through the ground, through buildings, through other bodies, out in midair... While it may seem like a small thing, there were a whole lot of people walking by my desk laughing at that very thing and saying how shoddy it was.   Well, I wrote in my first impressions of Delta Force: Land Warrior last week that I was having a bunch of fun with the game but it seemed a bit too easy. I also made the excessively brilliant comment that games usually get harder as you get farther into them. Well, that held true for Land Warrior, but for all of the wrong reasons. Instead of having the AI get increasingly harder and smarter, NovaLogic took the easy way out by throwing millions of enemies in your face. While it was a quite a bit of fun in one of the missions to defend yourself against an onslaught of Soldiering 101 failures, it certainly didn't fit the mold of the ~highly trained terrorists~ that you are supposedly battling.  The AI just never got better in the game. Even in the later missions, I found myself walking around a corner right into the path of a terrorist pointing an A-K 47 at me only to back away without the bad guy even trying to take a shot. He would say something in whatever language I'm guessing meant, ~No, no, it's okay. You weren't ready so it's a do over.~ And then I would shoot him. And he would die. No do overs now, eh? Not only was that annoying, but when sniping enemies and missing, enemies would most often:  A)Get in a prone position  B)Run for cover  C)Go get buddies and round up a posse  D)Look around for the sniper  E)Stand there looking like a dumbass  Can you guess? Correct! The answer is E. You win a big fat, ~you're so smart~ award. There were some times when the enemies actually fired back, but usually they didn't do a thing. Should we move onto friendly AI. Teammates, which are supposed to be helpful, ended up getting killed within the first couple of minutes in a mission half the time. They were reckless and really just annoyed the crap out of me. But every now and again they would manage to run by an enemy, standing up, at full speed, and the enemy would ignore it and run headlong at me instead.  There were also some other little problems with the single player game that didn't make sense. You can save anywhere in a mission, but when you use that save to come back into the game, you'll be replenished with all of the ammo you need. And when in a mission with an AI teammate, when coming back in using the save, the teammate won't respond or participate in the mission anymore. Little bugs, but they add up.  But even with all of these problems, I did manage to have fun with the game, as long as I put any hope of realism out of mind. All of the different specialties did add a bit of replay value to the single player as long as you tried to stick to using them as you're supposed to because you could easily use all of them in whatever role you wanted and still get through missions. Each of the characters is better with certain weapons and better in certain situations but not quite enough to really force you to change your tactics so you end up forcing yourself to try something new.  This also comes into what is probably the most popular part of the Delta Force series: the multiplay. NovaLogic hosts games over their servers called NovaWorld that hold up to 50 players per game. There are several types of games although none of them will be unfamiliar to a first person shooter veteran. Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, King of the Hill and all of the other regulars make their way into the game. Multiplayer in Land Warrior certainly is addicting however and solves all of the AI problems in single player unless you are playing against really bad players. Every specialty can play a part in this one. I had the most fun with a sniper rifle, but I was killed plenty of time by close quarter specialists using knives and machine gunners and grenadiers. Yeah, I died a whole lot, but it happens. When playing teams, organized groups of diverse weaponry and specialists can do a lot of damage. The point is that I had a lot of fun playing multiplay, and that is what is important when it comes down to it.  Unfortunately, the single player game didn't quite stack up to what I had hoped for after playing the game for a little while. Even though I did have a modicum of fun, the bad AI and graphics problems made the game pretty disappointing at times. If you can put up with those collision problems, and enjoy playing online, you'll find a pretty good group of people to play with over NovaWorld. If you really loved the first two Delta Force games (although you're suspect if you liked number two), and you just want the vastly improved multiplayer, you'll surely enjoy NovaLogic's latest outing. But if you were hoping that this incarnation would solve all of the past issues, you'll be a bit disappointed even with the new improved 3D accelerated engine.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
