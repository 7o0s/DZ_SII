{"name": "Peter Pan in Disney's Return to Never Land [GBA]", "name_review": "Disney's Peter Pan: Return to Never Land", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/03/04/disneys-peter-pan-return-to-never-land", "text": "There have already been a handful of Disney games released on the Game Boy Advance, but Peter Pan Return to Never Land marks the company's debut as GBA publisher. Normally, Disney Interactive licenses its properties to other publishers to produce Game Boy Advance titles, but looks like the company's ready to leap in and handle all aspects of the handheld renditions of its franchises. Unfortunately, as good as Peter Pan Return to Never Land looks, the tedious and sometimes unintuitive gameplay, as well as the wonky controls ground our elfish hero into the shelf of mediocre GBA platformers. Features Seven worlds 17 levels Two mini-games Four hidden FMVs Password save Only for Game Boy Advance  The game follows the recently-released theatrical sequel...but only a bit. In the game, you assume the role of Peter Pan himself...he's just arrived in London to show Wendy's kids a good time back in Never Land. When they get there, Tinkerbell gets kidnapped and then Wendy's kids, and it's off to rescue them and stop Captain Hook from doing whatever he's up to.  The game is, admittedly, a very pretty production, with well-animated character sprites, backgrounds, and still cutscenes that really take advantage of the GBA's color palette. Two hidden flying and cannon mini-games, accessible by collecting hidden pan flutes, also put to use the Game Boy Advance's scaling hardware, There are even a handful of short videoclips to watch...but you'll have to collect the reels hidden in four locations in the game. But where Peter Pan excels in graphic, it fails in gameplay...and it feels very rushed, most likely to make it on shelves for the release of the movie.  Peter can run, jump and butt-stomp enemies like all good platform heroes can...but when he grabs some pixie dust strewn throughout the level he can fly freely all over the place. It makes for a nifty game design, but it's a shame that the developers didn't make him control very well. It's obvious that the game's target is the younger GBA crowd, but Peter Pan is confusing to play...even for seasoned gamers like myself. Peter can and will get stuck against platforms mid-flight, and the clunky control scheme definitely becomes noticeable later in the game; I was even at a loss what was necessary to do during the downright clumsy and frustrating crocodile boss sequences. Levels abruptly end with no clear indication that it's the end of the area, and unless you've been keeping track of how many pan flutes you've been collecting, you'll never really know why you've been thrown to the mini-game at the end of a round...or, what you're supposed to do during these mini-games.  The level designs are also extremely bland and repetitive...the scenery changes during each world, but not the level structures. So, luckily, you're given a password save after every world of three levels...it's a good thing, too, since Peter Pan loses its fun quickly. It's best to take a break after every password earned so the tedium doesn't get you down. And the game's over really quickly, too...if you managed to outlast the unexciting gameplay and make it to the final boss, the game ends with barely a ~congratulations.~ Not a very fulfilling gaming experience, that's for sure.   Peter Pan looks great and sounds pretty good...no question about that. But the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. The developers didn't put enough effort into control tweaks or collision balancing...and continuity between levels is way too abrupt for a kids game. This really needed another month of polish, but considering the timeliness Disney needed for this game, it's pretty obvious that it was yanked out of the developers' hands before it was ready to go. At least, I'm hoping that was the problem.", "date": "Mar 4, 2002"}
