Nintendo has only had sporadic interest in sports gaming, succeeding best in niche genres, and outside that, no developer has really nailed home a killer sports title. That's including the entire run of the original green Game Boy as well as the life of the more powerful Game Boy Color. Outside a few satisfactory baseball games, sports fans have to sit it out year after year.  EA is finally getting into the game fully, to make up for some lost yardage. Already we've seen pocket versions of Madden, Live, and other EA franchises, but these were handled outside of EA's domain by developers for THQ. The results had ranged in quality, but always ended up a let-down in the long run. So we were excited to see EA reign the franchises back in to make their own attempts at professional sports. A new approach and renewed vigor for excellence seemed what was desperately needed. But, as it turns out, what we really need is a more powerful Game Boy.       Features:  Link play for head-to-head pigskin action Tons of plays and stats  All 31 NFL teams and updated rosters Only for Game Boy Color    To its credit, the developers of 3D6 have done what we've been asking for all along in the Game Boy version of the franchise -- Link Play. Madden is known as a detailed, explosive representation of football, made for football fans, and yet it can be argued that the real purpose to playing and mastering the single player game is to become a god in a head-to-head scrimmage against a friend or neighbor. THQ's versions of Madden skipped the feature, mostly because they relied on old Game Boy Pocket code that slowed the system down. But EA had the opportunity to start from scratch again, so they were able to design for multiplayer gaming from Day 1, and it shows.   The game flies along in multiplayer games without a hitch in speed or a stutter in flicker. And that goes for the rest of the game as well -- never a glitch or twitch in the graphics. Without the shackles of latent code, the game is really clean and fast. Players tear across the field in ways the older versions just couldn't touch. The player sprites are a little smaller than before, but there's also more screen real estate used in gameplay. There are also some nice new effects, like sound effects used to psyche out the hike.   On the other hand, the game is very evidently a first generation product from EA, and though the game is all-new and re-conceived, it's more archaic in many ways compared to THQ's efforts. The animation in the 2000 version of Madden is far and away superior to this game, with moving tackles and graduated player running -- something that makes a big deal when maneuvering along the line of scrimmage. Last year, you could see the hits and watch the tackles drop the running backs. This year, the game has devolved back to simple dives and splayed-out players, with no in-between animation.  The game also cuts back in the game play. Last year, THQ was able to add passing windows. EA, unfortunately, has not been able to replicate what has become one of the key features of the Madden series, and as a result, the passing game is again a matter of guess work. There aren't even arrows or indicators to tell if your receiver is open, and when they are, chances are the ball might come up far short because receivers are sometimes programmed to run until the edges of the stadium for a bomb, even though there's no way the QB could pass that far.  All the real teams and stats are in the game, so Madden fanatics can take heart that the core is there. It has the chance to play a great game. But on the field, EA again drops the pass. With such limited animation, it's tough to tell when a pass has been caught, or who's recovered a fumble. The playbook has a lot to offer, and the players run their routes well both offensively and defensively. However, the game's collision detection often screws up. Quarterbacks get tangled up in crisscrossing patterns waiting for linemen to rush by, and on the same line, defenders on a blitz stand a much greater chance of getting stuck against their own men than getting tied up in a block. Defensively, the game feels broken in the tackling game -- even when running arm-against-arm with a running back, you have to tap the tackle button, which invariably launches your defensive back into a dive that will miss the play. Tackles have to be almost exactly on the pixel, so even when going up through a full line of skins, you can skin by them all if the computer (or your link player friend) screws up the tackles. There's no juke or spin move, so passing through a crowd without a single block is just a matter of trusting the other guy to screw up. Chances are, he will.

With live chats, real-time audio and interactive polls, you can experience NFL action like never before. This isn't what we wanted to see from EA's first outing on a football field for the Game Boy Color, but it's still a decent first step. Full season mode, complete rosters, and books chock full of plays give some options to the game, and even though a game in Madden 2001 actually takes as much time to play as a real game -- four 15 minute quarters took three hours for me to play, making a full Season an unbelievable chore -- it's still a fast and furious football game, and a great one to play linked against a friend.But while the engine holds its own, the gameplay drops way short. It's an enjoyable game for those who just want a few ten-yard fights, but when my first full game drew up a score of 92 to 73 at the half, it just seemed a little silly. 3D6 has a good engine, but it's missing some of the key features for a Madden game, particularly the passing windows and the articulate animation. Without it, this feels too much like an arcade-like offensive charge from the 8-bit era, and even for those who grew up on the incredible Genesis Madden games, this simply isn't enough.", "date": "Nov 23, 2000"}
