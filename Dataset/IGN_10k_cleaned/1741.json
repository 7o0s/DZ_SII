{"name": "RC Revenge Pro", "name_review": "RC Revenge Pro", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/01/26/rc-revenge-pro-2", "text": "For those that aren't familiar with the series, RC Revenge Pro is essentially an upgraded version of RC Revenge, which was the PlayStation sequel to Re-Volt, which was released on the PC, Dreamcast and PlayStation.  Even though the PlayStation version of Re-Volt was the least impressive of the three, Sony's system was the one that Acclaim decided to make the sequel for it. But instead of trying the exact same thing again, the developers tried a different approach and ended up creating a pleasurable racing experience that was a good effort, even though it had its share of flaws.   Gameplay Despite its flaws, which came in the form of uninspiring track design and overly aggressive AI, RC Revenge was a fun game on PlayStation. It didn't have the same framerate problems that killed the PlayStation incarnation of Re-Volt and was simply a blast to play. Even though RC Revenge Pro is basically a port of the same game with some new improvements, it's nowhere as good.   The problems with it is that while the previous game had a fast pace, moved relatively smoothly and offered fun and addictive races, this game doesn't do any of those things well. The sensation of speed is not there, creating a situation where you never really get any sort of an adrenaline rush because you don't feel like you're moving quickly, and the AI of the computer-controlled vehicles is very inconsistent. The typical race will either see you get out in front and stay in the lead the entire race, or have you mixed up in the pack and find yourself going from first to last or last to first on a yo-yo type basis.   And to make things even worse, the framerate takes a serious hit whenever there's more than one car on the screen and a power-up is going off. And because of the slowdown, the control in these situations isn't nearly as tight as it normally is, so it's easy for you to get knocked around and steer off course in these circumstances where you need solid control and a good framerate the most.   The game does have a lot of tracks, plenty of secrets to open up, a wide variety of cars, a two-player mode (let's not even get into how unplayable this mode is) and a nicely crafted track editor, but none of it matters. The game isn't any fun to play and it's one of the least entertaining racing games that you'll find on PlayStation 2 or any other console.   Graphics It'd be easy just to bash the game's visuals with a reckless abandon for being some of the worst of any game on the console and to say that it's nothing but a quick port of the PlayStation version, but that's not really the case. Despite it looking like nothing but a high-res version of a PlayStation game, the backgrounds in RC Revenge Pro do feature quite a few elements that weren't in its 32-bit cousin. There are tons of new special effects in the form of lighting, atmospheric elements like fog and smoke, and other little niceties like transparent water and moving background objects. The transparent water with the sharks moving down below that can actually come up and impede your progress is an especially nice touch.   All of this, however, doesn't save the game's visuals at all. In fact, it would've better served the developers to not beef up the detail at all over the PlayStation game because it seems to have come at a major cost. The game's framerate is horrible and there's more slowdown in this game than in any other that we've played on the PlayStation 2. The sensation of speed that was in the first game is not here and the game comes to a crawl whenever there's a pack of two or more cars together on screen with any kind of special effect or power-up weapon going off.   Beyond the slowdown, players of the game will also have to suffer through some of the worse shimmering and aliasing problems that the PS2 has yet seen. It's not bad on every single level, but many of them look like a jagged mess -- with the pirate ship level being the most abusive on one's eyes. The game's visuals simply pale in comparison to Re-Volt on the Dreamcast and because of the slowdown, some might even say that it's a downgrade from the PlayStation version of RC Revenge. This game really seems rushed and shouldn't have made it through Sony's approval process.   Sound The general sound effects are pretty weak and the music gets an ~A~ for awful. While the tunes generally fit with the settings of the different tracks, they have repetitive beats and are very unnerving. Your best bet is to throw in your Britney Spears or Mandy Moore and turn down the volume on your television. If not, you'll be yelling out ~hit me baby one more time~ because you'll want the pain to end.  I took a lot of abuse from my peers (other editors at IGN and from competing publications) because I was one of the very few people on this green earth that happened to enjoy RC Revenge on the age-old PlayStation. Sure, it wasn't anywhere as good as the game's Dreamcast prequel, Re-Volt, but the developers were able to do the best that they could when you take into account the limitations of the console. And, even more importantly, they were able to create what I thought was a very addictive and enjoyable racing game. I was so happy with the game that I stated in my review that it was one of the most enjoyable racing games on the PlayStation. Well, this PlayStation 2 port of RC Revenge has none of the same appeal that made me enjoy and cherish the PlayStation version. The game suffers from an excess of slowdown, doesn't move nearly as fast as the 32-bit version, and simply lacks any of the addictive qualities that made it so enjoyable on PlayStation. This game is not any fun and stands as one of the worst games that I've had the displeasure of playing on Sony's newly released platform.", "date": "Jan 26, 2001"}
