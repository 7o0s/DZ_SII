{"name": "NASCAR 2000", "name_review": "NASCAR 2000", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/08/05/nascar-2000", "text": "NASCAR 2000 is a different kind of racer for a different breed of people, from a different bloodline compared to F1 Racer or RC Pro-AM. Those games are about the thrill and challenge of driving and steering, looking to find short-cuts and power-ups and good lines for taking turns. NASCAR titles take all of that out of consideration -- all you get are left and only left turns, and lots of them. However, considering how most handheld (or 8-bit racers in general, for that matter) can hardly handle corners in general, losing the option of turning in one whole direction actually doesn't hurt the game too much.  Instead, NASCAR 2000 is a game of stat tweaks and driver bios and car mods and other abbreviations. It's a game where you can jack the car up and tinker with the suspension and tire ratio before taking it out on a full 328-lap event. It's a game that tries to be so realistic that if you biff hard enough, you may find yourself driving in the wrong direction. Most of all, it's a game for NASCAR fans, and probably only NASCAR fans. THQ and the developers at Creations (formerly Software Creations) haven't run a checkered flag lap with this Game Boy Color game -- the graphic engine chops up like Martin Yan, and the game's controls just can't keep up with all of the details -- but it still works for what it is, and considering that THQ rarely puts this kind of polish on a game (Link mode, full season, battery back-up), I feel fine about defending the game against NASCAR crashers.   Features:  16 real NASCAR tracks 26 real drivers, complete with authentically detailed cars Full Season mode Battery back-up for stat saves and season tracking Link Cable compatible for head-to-head racing Only for Game Boy Color   The facts and figures will stand for themselves, so while I'm in THQ's corner on this game, I'm still not going to dodge the facts. The game is a chunky, ugly, downcast, dead grey, fugly racer. She's not much to look at, and thank god she's got no sisters. Trackside detail is clear, but only because the game doesn't actually scale -- it instead redraws each frame with a nasty hack and some spittle. The draw-in doesn't even alternate, and with roadside objects like grandstands, tractors, and signs repeating with every jerky flash, it sometimes looks like your car is standing still. Cars pop up on the horizon as grey boxes, and suddenly pop color just as you're about to ram them. A car coming up behind you will often crash into you and appear on your screen in the same chop.   Yes, it's a damn ugly racer. A scud, if you will. But taken in stride, everything else about the game works around that awful, awful, dreadful graphic engine. For instance, the game can handle 20 cars on the track. Even if you get half of those are on the screen at the same time (and that happens), the game is already so much of a chop-a-licious that it can't possibly chop up any more than that. And it doesn't, running at full speed and full chop with a whole pack on a tiny Game Boy screen. Pack mentality is now possible, as never before on the Game Boy, because you have to be wary of stepping out from a draft on corners or attempting a tight pass by a guy who's not afraid to swerve to block a pass.  Control of the game is faulted but fair, and though the god-awful graphic engine (which does get better on some tracks, but then gets real ugly on others) hurts the gameplay some. Some attempt has been made at pseudo analog steering, so tapping and grinding down on a turn will yield different results. Cars even yaw out of a banked turn, and the game has enough power behind it to draw different angles of banks. If you handle a track perfectly, the control feels really nice and smooth, and the game runs best once you're running with wicked speed. On the other hand, cars slip easily into a steep turn and begin pinballing down the track, particularly at key moments such as passing or banking. Because of this, the control falters badly at slower speeds and in crises. Though the sound (which is awful in the way only 8-bit racers can sound awful) seems to show power sliding, the cars actually pull into turns a lot more than they should (as opposed to Infogrames Test Drive Le Mans, which had you slipping all over the track).  You can, however, tweak everything about the car, and this is really what the true NASCAR fans will be into. Tweaking your wheel lock, fuel capacity, spoiler, weight jacking, and shocks is detail work that may well drive you crazy, and to make matters even more insane, many of these details have separate variables that can be further fine-tuned -- how about adjusting independently each tire's pressure on the car? Again, the game's chunky engine makes some of these variables moot, other times you can really make the game cook with some detail work. Running on fumes means lots of pits, but you're light as air when you are out there.  Then there's the Head-to-Head link mode, and the Season mode with Battery back-up instead of password. Both of these features are brand spankin' new to THQ, who never quite went the whole nine before in a sports game. Hopefully, this is the start of something new for the company, as Madden, NHL, and FIFA could benefit tons from added polish and resources.  Think of it this way: How many Game Boy games let you choose to drive with manual transmission? And how many also track damage to the car, to the point where races are more about driving well and placing all season long rather than going balls-out every lap and risking all just for first place? Damage is tracked across the car, and THQ has even done some fun things with the damage by including a limited damage mode, a kind of forgiving arcade version (you can also turn damage off) where the car is affected by crashes, but will eventually repair itself if you take it easy on the bad part. Even with all damage off, you'll still have to make strategic pits for fuel, and so knowing when to run and when to come in is just as valuable a skill as in the real sport. Heck, there are even pictures of all 25 NASCAR pros with full career bios, and while a guy like me couldn't care less about that if I were dead, my backwoods oakie grandma who loves NASCAR on her B&W TV but has no internet access or magazine racks in the nearby booze shack might thumb through this feature 'til her teeth grow back.  NASCAR games are what cut the consummate professionals of the games business from the fair-weather Johnsons. Oh sure, we all love reviewing the latest Mario or Zelda game simply because they're a joy to play. And while the aftermath of a wrathful game PR company isn't always worth it, there's always a gleeful release in unloading on a horrible Muppets or Rugrats game.But then a NASCAR game comes along, and suddenly you realize just how out of your league you are. I mean, a race game where you turn left and only left? What fun is that? But there are people in other parts of the country (and trust me, unless you yourself are a NASCAR fan, the fan fervor is in some other part of the country no matter where you live) who love this sport. Love it! Don't get me wrong -- I'd much rather be a fair-weather fan boy than have to wade through NASCAR games as a career, but taken in moderation and with the right frame of mind, they can be fun. And THQ's version of the EA Sports NASCAR franchise is, despite an awful graphics engine, enough fun for what it is to warrant a look for NASCAR fans. If you're just a casual race game, first off you should know never to be duped into a review by the NASCAR name ever again (need I say it again? LEFT TURNS!) and to instead check out Infogrames Wacky Races and Test Drive Le Mans. But if you're one of those guys living in wherever-the-heck you are and can't get enough NASCAR, all of the stats and licenses and realistic car options and knick-knacks and whatnot will light up your life. And even for others who fear NASCAR like all other things Southern, this pocket racer won't hurt you as much as, say, abolition of Darwinism or a nasty rodeo accident.", "date": "Aug 5, 2000"}
