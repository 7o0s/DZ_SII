The game marked the first time since EA Sports started making both the college and professional sports that the college edition was arguably superior to its professional counterpart, as March Madness 2000 offered gamers many advantages over NBA Live 2001, including a better framerate, smoother play, and more features and customizable gameplay options.   With the game's follow-up, which is aptly titled NCAA March Madness 2001, it looks as if EA Sports realized that they had a good thing with last year's version as nothing significant has really been changed. The game pretty much features all of the options and features that made last year's game one of the most feature rich in the history of sports videogames and has simply added to it to make it even more robust and playable than ever before.   Gameplay  NCAA March Madness 2001 has just about everything that any college basketball fan would ever look for in a videogame representation of the sport. It has everything that was in last year's version, including a comprehensive Dynasty mode, the Women's Sweet 16, a basic tournament, and a Dream Tournament mode that lets players compete in a tournament that features over 60 all-time classic teams, including some of UCLA's legendary teams from the late '60s and early '70s and the University of Michigan team that featured the Fab Five.   What's new to the game is the addition of a Coach K's Coach Mode that's a new option in the game's already extensive Dynasty Mode. The difference with this option turned on is that instead of picking and choosing which team to control, players are randomly given a small school to coach with a different set of goals that must be reached. For instance, players might be given the task of taking the realms of Bethune-Cookman Wildcats with the basic goals of finishing the season with a winning record, winning three conference games, and beating at least one top 25 team or three teams ranked above you in the conference.   The Coach K's Coach Mode manages to add quite a bit of play value to the game since it can give players something extra to aim for once they have already taken their own favorite school or Alma Marta all the way to the top. In addition to getting the opportunity to see if you can change one of these schools from the bottom rung of the NCAA to a full-fledged dynasty, the player can also look to move up the ladder as a coach and possibly pass Mike Krzyewski's 469 wins on the Coach's Leader Board rankings.   Beyond the rich play modes and features, March Madness 2001 also fairs well in the area of customizable options. Just as the case with last year's version, just about every single aspect of the game ranging from blocked shot frequency to the speed of the game can be tinkered with and set at a variety of levels that will help ensure that the game meets just about everyone's expectations of what a basketball videogame should play like.    However, even with the ability to customize the frequency of things such as blocked shots and steals, the rate of recurrence of both of those facets of the game still happens too much. Even when playing with the game with both the Blocked Shot and Steal meters turned all the way down, players should expect to find out that they're still blocking and stealing a lot from the computer and vice versa. Still, having both of the meters set all the way down does bring it to a more realistic frequency and it's much more believable than the default setting.   As far as the game's difficulty and AI is concerned, it's far more challenging than it was last year, which was so easy even on the Senior difficulty level that you could take the worst teams in the league and put them up against the best and not have too much of a problem beating them. Nevertheless, the game's only really challenging on the very hardest setting, as the Freshmen, Sophomore and Junior levels didn't even post that much of a challenge regardless of the match-ups. On the Senior level, it proved to be pretty difficult to take one of the game's worst teams and beat a team like the Duke Blue Devils. And even when playing as the Blue Devils, there were plenty of close games and even a few losses against top 25 competitors.   Conversely, the individual AI for CPU controlled players in the game proved to be quite flawed. While players did move a lot without the ball, they tended to get all bunched up together and would run in some weird and unrealistic patterns. In fact, when running up the court on offense, players will sometimes encounter a situation where all of their computer-controlled teammates will run the other way, giving them a strange one-on-five situation. When this happens you'll either have to just take on the challenge or wait until the players all decided to run back to the offensive half of the court.   March Madness 2001 also has some smaller AI problems that hurt the realist play of the game. Because of the problem with the players getting bunched up together and not spacing themselves well combined with the fact that there's an overabundance of steals and blocked shots, it's quite hard to run any sort of a real half-court offense. Even simple things like getting the ball to a guy in the post can sometimes be difficult just because your other teammates will sometimes all gather around together, making it near impossible to get the ball in to the man that you want without it being stolen by one of the three of four defensive players in the near vicinity.   Alls not bad in the game, though, as March Madness 2001 makes up for many of its AI problems by giving players a high level of control of the players. The control, which is both tight and intuitive, allows players to do just about everything that they would want to do in a game. The only thing that's missing is analog control, something that in the minds of some players is reason enough to not own the game. There are also some problems with scripted animation taking the player out of control and sometimes out of bounds or to the other side of the court giving them a backcourt violation, but the good points about the control outweigh the negatives.   Graphics  Just as was the case with March Madness 2000, this year's game once again goes for a better framerate over more player animation. March Madness 2001 is only average in terms of player animation as other games on PlayStation have more fluid player movement and better looking moves and transitions between them. But, the game more than makes up for it with a rock solid framerate and fast movement that blows away its competitors that have the better animation.   Moreover, the game also gets some points for its high attention to detail. The player models are a lot more varied in size, shape and look than ever before in the series, and the same can be said about the basketball venues. EA Sports has accurately modeled over 150 different real-life arenas, and while you won't see most of it during gameplay, it's definitely a nice touch that helps add a lot to the game's overall atmosphere.   Sound  One of the game's brightest spots is undoubtedly its sound. Pretty much everything that made last year's game so great in this area, including all of the recorded chants and the real fight songs performed by the real bands, are back and Dick Vitale's repetitive and annoying announcing has been replaced by a new play-by-play and color man. The play-by-play announcing is generally in tune with what's going on in the game and there are some nice little touches, but the color man does nothing but scream and gets every bit as annoying as Vitale did in last year's game. Still, there's not another title out there that better brings out the true atmosphere of the college game through the use of audio.  Looking back, I think that I gave March Madness 2000 a higher score than I should have. While I still stand by my belief that it was a good basketball videogame and superior to NBA Live 2000, it didn't quite deserve a 9.1 out of 10. For one, it had problems with regard to its difficulty that should've been reason enough to knock its score down at least a point or more. So, while I believe that this year's game is an improvement over what was given to us last year and should be considered one of the very best basketball games on PlayStation, March Madness 2001 is getting a lower score than what was given to last year's version. Additionally, I'm also giving it a lower score than what Fabian gave to NBA Live 2001, a game that I think is about on the same level of this one. For those that decided to forgo reading the review and went right to the scores and comments, here's a quick summary of what I thought about NCAA March Madness 2001. The game is one of the most feature rich sports games that I've ever played, with tons of customizable options and numerous play modes including an excellent Dynasty Mode and Coach K's Coach Mode. It has excellent control, decent graphics, a solid framerate, and a high attention to the details of the college game. However, there's no analog control, the block and steal frequencies are always a bit too high, and the AI has some weird problems (read the review for more details). Nevertheless, it's a very good basketball game and one of the best you'll be able to find on PlayStation.", "date": "Dec 19, 2000"}
