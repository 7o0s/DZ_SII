From the Street Fighter clones to the variety of 3D fighting games, there's usually a game for just about anyone's taste. A smaller scale division of this genre is the UFC/Pride circle. Real men, real fights, no gloves; it's this style of violent entertainment that has a more concentrated, and more loyal fan base, though the numbers have yet to rise into the traditional sports levels. With the games associated with this sport, realism and authenticity are what count, and overall, the games have been successful in this approach.  Enter K-1 fighting. A sport very different from UFC/Pride yet often grouped into the same category, K-1 is more structured in format; there are more rules, fighters where gloves, and one fighting style dominates: kickboxing (though Muay- Thai, karate, and boxing are also featured). Ever increasing in popularity in the States, K-1 fighting has an enormous fan base in Japan, comparable to football stateside; fighters are celebrities and can be seen endorsing everything from ramen noodles to domestic appliances. Great stuff to check out if you get the chance.  Several K-1 games have been released in the past, surprisingly enough, from Jaleco and THQ. And though K-1 World Grand Prix is not Konami's first, it is its first to be released in the US. Fortunately for us, it's the leader of the pack for K-1 games and easily ranks among the best realistic fighting games on any platform.  Gameplay K-1 World Grand Prix uses a fighting system that borrows from a number of games, and also includes some innovations of its own. Being a sport that mixes several fighting styles, it only makes sense that the game has taken this approach. The face buttons correspond to the character's left and right limbs, much like Tekken, and the should buttons are for blocking, taunting, big hits, and combos -- nothing to out of the ordinary here, though the combo system is worth mentioning.    By holding down the R2 button and pressing a face button, the player will perform a short, typically three-move combo. This gives each character roughly four combos they can perform (one for each face button), but not everyone has that many. While this system works well and even makes the game more accessible to players, the lack of more numerous combinations can feel limiting at times. Still, the one-hit-at-a-time fights are typical of a K-1 fight. Though the combos should be used when an opening in the opponent's guard is found, most players not familiar with fighting tactics will likely always use the combos as a means of attack, bypassing all strategic thought.   But those who adopt such methods of play will undoubtedly lose matches against more seasoned players. And this is part of what make K-1 World Grand Prix work as well as it does. The game captures the feel and pace of a real world K-1 fight, and careless behavior will inevitably lead to a quick and painful knockout.   Ironically, what most players will probably have the hardest time accepting about K-1 is the pace and feel of the game. Slightly stiff, and by no means twitch-oriented, the slow, methodical speed may give gamers the wrong impression. K-1 takes time to master, but once you understand the mechanics of the game and how to play it, it is quite a rewarding experience. Not every game can create a realistic gap between skilled and novice gamers, but K-1 fits the bill quite nicely.       Many fighting games provide relatively shallow single-player experiences, but K-1 not only has an in-depth career mode (Champion's Revolution), but a cool Revival mode where players must recreate famous matches, a Trial mode, and a nifty Fighter Museum with viewable movie clips of the fighters in action. Add to that the standard multiplayer modes and some cool unlockables, and you've got yourself a well-rounded package that offers more than a lot of the competition. The only thing missing is Bob Sapp (though he's been confirmed for the sequel. Yay!).  Graphics Being a videogame based on a real sport with real life fighters usually implies one thing: An emphasis is placed on accuracy, not flash or effects when it comes to graphics. And, love it or hate it, this is exactly what K-1 World Grand Prix does; the fighter models bear an uncanny resemblance to their real world counterparts, and having been to real K-1 fight, we can easily say that the entire visual presentation of each fight is spot-on, right down to the attractive females that precede each round.  There's very little complain about from a pure technology standpoint. Characters are smooth and detailed, the animation is mo-capped goodness, and there is nary a hint of frames dropping. But what you won't get in K-1 are over-the-top effects and other bits of flash to googoo and gaga over (Guilty Gear XX anyone?) K-1 has an extremely solid graphics engine that any fan of the sport should find to their liking. Just don't expect more than that.  Sound In classic Japanese fashion, K-1 World Grand Prix is filled to the top with Eastern guitar rock that feels both out of place and appropriate. More fitting than an epic score, yet not quite as surface-pleasing as a licensed soundtrack, the music in K-1 is suitable for the most part. But to get the full effect, we recommend turning off the music, isolating the hard-hitting sound effects and ambient ring sounds. Then you've got yourself a real K-1 fight, right in the comforts of your own living room.    In summary, the music is guitar rock -- use to your liking; the sound effects are good, especially the ring announcer and hits. Being a fighting game, music is not necessarily a huge issue, so expect corresponding results. This is a fighting game, but you'll have to let go of what the term ~fighting game~ usually conjures up in your mind. With a feel that's a mix of a boxing game and an Ultimate Fighting game, don't expect split-second responsiveness and hectic gameplay every second of each round. What K-1 World Grand Prix does offer gamers is a more sim-like angle to the genre, with calculated moves and a pace that is easily on the realism side of the fence. K-1 is not the most accessible game, but it's surprisingly more upbeat and easy to get into than, say, Pride, or even Rocky. If you're even remotely interested in the sport, or just looking for something other than Virtua Fighter or Guilty Gear X, check out K-1 World Grand Prix. It's pretty killer.", "date": "Jul 18, 2003"}
