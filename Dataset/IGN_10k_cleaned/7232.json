It highlighted what the N64 could really do.  The game looked great, it had amazing multiplay options, and in features the pinnacle of  AI for console style games.  Unfortunately, what works as a console game doesn't necessarily attract PC gamers.  One of the biggest disappointments of Turok 2 for the PC is that it is almost a direct port of the N64 version.  The menus look like the N64 menus (right down to the fact that, at certain data entry screens, you have to choose letters from a list rather than simply typing using the keyboard).  And like the N64 version, you can't skip the cutscenes by hitting a key.  Now that's just frustrating.  Graphically, the game looks just like the N64 version, which doesn't work as well on a monitor as it did on a television.  The textures look grainy and dull and the color scheme is boring and heavy with grays.  Turok 2 also lacks any sky textures and you can't see into the distance.  Rather, you're confronted with either gray fog or simply black darkness that the landscape magically appears from as you get closer to it.  I can understand that the designers wanted to minimize the graphic detail on the N64 version to keep framerates up (even though it seemed to work better in theory than reality for the N64 version), but you just can't compete with all of the beautiful shooters in the PC market with graphics like this.  Level design is also less than exciting as you'll have to backtrack to several areas you've already seen, often wandering around a creature-less terrain for several minute before discovering the gate/warp/door to the next level.  There's not a lot that causes more frustration than exploring a level endlessly only to be stuck searching for the exit with nothing left to shoot. It's also rather annoying seeing ~Mission Failed~ shoot across your screen if you accidentally walk into a warper trying to circle-strafe a lizard spawn.    To make matters worse, if you return to an area that you've already been to some of the creatures will have re-spawned.  This would be fine if all of the health and ammo power-ups re-spawned as well, but as it stands this just makes trudging through levels a real pain in the ass, not to mention adding several dead Turoks to the pile 'cause you ran out of ammo.  There are some good things about Turok 2.  The arsenal variety is some if the best in any first person shooter, rivaling the ingenuity and creativity found in Shogo.  There are over twenty different weapons (very cool since most FPSers stick to ten or less) and each is fairly different from the next.  Unlike the N64 version, the PC version also lets you save your game at any point.  This addresses one of the biggest problems that N64 users complained about-the save portals were spread too far apart.  The game also plays a lot smoother than the N64 version.  You've probably heard about the framerate problems on Turok 2 for the N64.  Well, for the most part framerate is fairly smooth on the PC.  There were a few spots were you'll experience some slowdown, but these are few and far between.  I even have a big bruise on my arm because Peer and Matt kept hitting me every time they'd walk by my monitor as I was taking on four baddies at once.   Of course, the multiplay aspects of first person shooters are what attracts many gamers to FPSers.  Let's just go ahead and admit that it's a heck of a lot of fun to blow the every living crud outta your buddies.  Well, like the rest of the game, there are some real highs and lows to the multiplayer experience in Turok 2.  I have to say that the text-to-speech taunt is a fabulous feature that more games should adopt. You just type in your insult and your buddy hears it in its full computer-generated glory. Sure, it's rather hard to type ~Rooney, you were raised by half-witted dingos~ before getting your brains drilled with the cerebral borer, but it's a scream to actually hear taunts instead of just reading them off of the monitor.  On the down side, the multiplayer maps seem to suffer from the same uninspired level design that's found in the single player game ... only it's a bit worse.  For the most part, they're just too small to offer much fun in a massive multiplayer setting.  Another big downfall is there's no Fragtag mode in the PC version.  Sheesh, now I gotta go hook up the N64 if I wanna shoot the monkey!!!    In the end, Turok 2 proves that what makes a good game on the N64 doesn't necessarily have what it takes to satisfy PC gamers.  Some of the things that N64 gamers woo about-sound reactive opponents, enemies that hide, and locational damage-have been in most PC shooters for years. If it would have been released two years ago, Turok 2 might have stood a chance in the PC FPS market.  But as it stands now, there's just not enough room for a game like Turok 2.  -- Tal Blevins  For a comparative view of the N64 version of Turok 2, check out IGN64's review here.", "date": "Feb 27, 1999"}
