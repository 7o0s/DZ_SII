A few cast members have cashed in on success with new books, such as Frank Vincent's guide to being a man, and grocery stores in the Tri-State area will soon be stocking Bada Bing! ice cream sandwiches. Mobile gaming stood no chance of escaping the Soprano net, with both a trivia game and the THQ Wireless-published Sopranos Poker.   There is an absolute saturation of poker games on the decks and this one brings absolutely nothing new to the table. It's a competent, but unexciting, poker game that hangs all of its fortunes on a popular license. These are the kind of games that frustrate me, because the license doesn't really have any affect on the play mechanics at all -- it's just there to get some extra eyeballs. And when somebody who is a big fan of the show downloads the game and realizes all they are getting is a basic poker game with unblinking portraits of Tony, Paulie, and Silvio looking back at them, I'm afraid they may judge all of mobile gaming for this underwhelming experience.   I tried imagining today what would be a better use of the Sopranos license than a base-level poker sim. Maybe a puzzle game where you are the wedding planner for Johnny Sack's daughter and have to draw up seating arrangements? Or a maze game with Paulie and Christopher having to get out of Pine Barrens before they freeze? (Oh, and the power-ups are ketchup packets.) Or perhaps a sort of Where's Waldo puzzler where you have to spot Vito in the leather bar?   As mentioned, the mechanics are solid. The five-card game you play with Tony, Paulie, and Silvio, plays like you would expect it to. You can even cheat a little and peek at the cards of the players next to you. I did this whenever I could and was never busted. One time, after winning a big hand, Silvio did pop up and say, ~This guy cheats.~ The strippers from the Bing play Texas Hold'em with you, and again, the game play is fine, but just not too exciting. (If you want to play a poker game with half-naked women, you are better off checking out Gameloft's Sexy Poker 2006.) There is a pawn shop where you can sell items like your watch for cash to keep in the games.   At least THQ Wireless' license allowed them to use the likeness of actors from the show, but even then, they all look just a little ~off.~ And they do not move. For example, while playing with the fellas, Tony busted out -- but he still sits at the table, holding cards, looking straight at you. That strikes me as sort of lazy. The guys couldn't switch positions or change expressions at all?  I don't care how big of a fan of The Sopranos you are -- avoid this game like you would avoid a country drive with Silvio. The poker is passable, but there are so many better simulations on the decks that deserve your download dollars. This is a lazy licensed product and nobody deserves much reward for that. For your Sopranos fix, you're better off just waiting patiently for Sunday nights.", "date": "Apr 11, 2006"}
