It comes down to the games, really. The SNES is the only place that has marquee names like Mario and Zelda, but the Genesis has not arcade shakers like Space Harrier and Out Run, but also the best 16-bit RPG yet, Phantasy Star II. Remember, this is before the advent of the Internet, so you're making your choice primarily on the strength of magazine content and back-of-the-box information at retail. You have your $200 in your pocket, ready to make a commitment to one console based on the strength of its current or promised library.   How does this box affect your decision?      Yeesh.   This ranks as one of my favorite bad boxes. It looks like it was thrown together by a first-day intern that was terrified of being remotely bold. Not only is the art just plain bad (the perspective and depth are off), but it fails to raise the pulse. Who would seriously buy this game.   Well, me, for one.   Yes, I know I railed Jewel Master's box as an affront to the eyes, but if you read the back, the game sounds pretty interesting. As a player looking beyond just basic jumping attacks, I was intrigued by jewel Master's basic premise. You collect a series of elemental rings that, when worn in different combinations, allowed you to cast a host of magic spells from fire balls to ice daggers. If you combined the most powerful rings of each element, you got a magic sword that gave you an advantage against the final boss. I know that sounds a little hoary to players used to the Ratchet & Clank school of huge arsenals with secondary fire functionality. But in 1991? Whoa.   However, in spite of this clever concept, Jewel Master is a very cookie-cutter side-scrolling action game. In 1991, these things were as common as peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in a grade school cafeteria. Your goal is to press through five different levels in the land of Mythgard, each themed as you would expect: forest, ice, desert, etc. The final destination is the evil king Jardine's palace. Each level is devoid of any real puzzle elements; the focus is moving from left to right, striking down incoming monsters with your magic attacks. Occasionally, the game thinks vertically and you hump up some stairs or drop down a cave.   Now, you can level those accusations at a number of 16-bit scrollers -- and rightfully so. But the pacing of the enemies in these uninventive environments is what makes the game so blah. There are no surprises here. The enemies, from weird-faced fish to very ugly yeti, always show up on cue. And they often do it overwhelmingly so, crushing you so you have to start the stage all over from the beginning when you hit that inevitable continue screen.      The bosses are where Jewel Master gets more interesting. Each stage is capped with a final encounter, such as a giant turtle or a huge phoenix. These monsters are tough, and the trick to beating them is to use your rings is the proper combinations. For example, the first boss is a panther that can outrun your hero... unless you put on the wind ring by itself for a useful speed boost. It's tempting to use the wind ring with your fire ball for a projectile attack, but trust me, you want that speed boost.   Jewel Master is not one of the better looking Genesis games. It uses familiar tricks like parallax scrolling to give the game a little kick, but there is just no way around the game's uninspired animations and character designs. When your hero is outshone by the muscle studs of Altered Beast, you're in trouble. The music, composed by Motoaki Takenouchi, is decent. Takenouchi's later work, such as Shining Wisdom for the Saturn, is much better. Jewel Master is not one the Genesis' shining stars and should it ever surface on the Virtual Console, I seriously doubt it would garner much attention. Despite the cool ring idea, too much of Jewel Master is tame. The game works entirely within the boundaries for a 16-bit side-scrolling action game. For a much better example of the genre, definitely check out Super Castlevania IV for the SNES.", "date": "Feb 4, 2008"}
