Take a deep breath and try to relive those glory days for just a few seconds. Now imagine that experience was a video game and that was all there was to it. The new Hot Wheels: World Race is exactly that. I know what you're thinking. You think I'm kidding, but no, it exists and it's sure to please little kids who love their toy cars and nobody else.GameplayHot Wheels: World Race is a fast game set in the future. Zip arrows are placed on a narrow track to speed you along. To power-up, golden rings can be collected in order to boost the car's Nitrox power. Fill it up, hit the boost button, and off you go like a bunny rabbit on speed. This boost power is necessary on courses that have straight stretches and ramps. Use them well and you can zip past or even over the other cars.There is one other way to boost your Nitrox levels. Zip arrow-powered ramps send the Hot Wheels cars flying over ridiculously large chasms. With the long hangtime, tricks can be performed in mid-air. Perform a good trick and land it cleanly and the Nitrox level will fill up to the top. If you hit a ramp and hit the boost button at the same time, the car will launch into the air, leave a fiery trail and create vortexes of color around it. Doing this enables an even longer hangtime and the ability to reach out-of-the-way tracks and additional rings or power-ups in the air. Mastering these tricks become essential in doing well in the game because this game is about getting that extra boost. Unfortunately, these tricks are extremely simple. The cars can flip forward and backward and roll left and right. It's possible to mix up a left roll and a right roll or do the same thing with the flips, but mixing between a flip and a roll is out of the question. This quickly limits the possible combinations to a half-dozen possibilities. All of which will need to be performed because one trick will become ~stale~ if it gets repeated and result in no extra Nitrox.In recognition of this lack of options, one extra feature to the trick system has been added. During a trick, button combinations will appear at the top of the screen. Hit them in order and the trick becomes even more rewarding. This does not in any way affect the trick itself like causing a special flip or combination, it just keeps it from becoming stale. It would have been a lot nicer if there was an SSX style trick system that rewarded kids for creativity rather than memorization and button mashing.The skill of the tricks here is the landing. For all the simplicity of the trick system, getting all four wheels down at the same time is another matter entirely. Get off kilter by just a little bit and the car slow down a good deal. It's a curious mix of easy tricks and frustrating landing. The AI seems to have no problem, landing smoothly every time.To make sure that no gamer gets left behind, a speed regulation system enables anyone to completely wreck their car and catch up within 10 seconds. While this is great for younger gamers who can quickly recuperate from their mistakes, there is one big drawback. If you're at the front and even use a boost near the end to speed away, one small mistake can bump your car from first to sixth in a couple seconds since the cars are grouped so closely together.There are 15 courses to race on and they feature all sorts of crazy racing terrain. Courses run along walls, twist through the air, loop around, and have ramps to launch you through the air. The courses are designed to be a bit cartoonish and out there. Fans of any ~serious~ driving will cringe at the wackiness of it all, but it's good for younger gamers who want the action frenetic. With so many crazy elements and the quick speed, sometimes it can be a little hard to see what's coming up ahead. Memorization is the best tool for knowing that after a twist, the car better be on the right side so you can hit the hidden ramp. The control here is a little too quirky to make racing easy for kids. The cars feel very light, almost as if they're not quite attached to the track. Taking tight turns require the use of a handbrake that invariably slows the car down and requires quite a bit of finesse. If power slides had been utilized, the game would move faster and be more fun.Mastering this system does have some rewards, namely the Hot Wheels cars themselves. There are 35 cars in five different categories: Scorchers, Dune Ratz, Street Breed, Roadbeasts, and Wave Rippers. If a kid is a big fan of Hot Wheels, this game would help pass the time. It's hard to see anyone else spending much time with it though.GraphicsThe colors in Hot Wheels: World Race are bright and loud. Since the cars race along extremely fast on tracks that literally twist and turn and loop, this helps out quite a bit. It's still gaudy and ugly, but it works in its own way. The courses are a bit fantastic and often feature big colorful flowers or bright red lava waterfalls.The framerate is smooth in single-player. With the tracks and the cars screaming along, the game flowed along without a hitch. In split-screen mode for two players it was a whole different story. The framerate dropped down a few notches and made it a lot more difficult to figure out what was going on. Considering that the tracks were meant to be fast, the loss of framerate made it very difficult.SoundThe music is a by-the-numbers soundtrack with random ~rock~ tunes backing up the game and funk interludes in the menus. It's all appropriate enough for the goings-on, but nothing special.The sound effects are pretty basic, a half dozen or so growls and beeps make up the large majority of the audio. Since you'll need to keep eyes on the screen at all times, this probably won't be noticeable.Hot Wheels: World Race is meant to be a simple game for kids. Using the Hot Wheels license, it's clear that THQ has aimed this at the 12-and-under set. Trying to be both big and loud and easy to pick up, Hot Wheels: World Race makes some odd decisions. The racing has some interesting courses and a simplified trick system, but the tricks become old way too quick and the control is too quirky and difficult to be a lot of fun. Courses require memorization and little to no strategy or creativity. Parents looking for a deep, skill-based racing game would be better off looking elsewhere. Those looking for a rather disposable, simplistic arcade racing game in the broadest interpretation of these descriptors just might -- might, we emphasize -- be interested.", "date": "Oct 31, 2003"}
