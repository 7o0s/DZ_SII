The characters are always done right, with great voice acting, a nice overall look, plenty of humor, and characters representative of their TV cartoon counterparts.  Warthog's Loons: The Fight for Fame continues that tradition.  Unfortunately, keeping up the Looney Tunes appearance is about all this game gets right.  An attempt at Power Stone with Looney Tunes characters, Loons fails to bring the three things madcap fighting games need -- speed, frenzy, and tension.  Features  Tons of gags straight from your favorite cartoons 15 different movie sets to fight in 7 mini-games to change up the fighting pace Up to four players battle it out with no split screen Play as Taz, Bugs Bunny, Sylvester, or Daffy Duck Lots of goodies to unlock, including classic Looney Tunes cartoons 5.1 Dolby Digital  Gameplay The plot for Loons comes straight from the mind of Mel Brooks.  Scoundrels Rocky and Mugsy have a great idea to make some cash -- run a Hollywood studio into the ground making an over-budgeted flop so they can then buy the studio on the cheap.  This sounds similar to Brook's The Producers and seems like a great way to start off a game spoofing the movies.  To help make movie a disaster, the two hire the worst director in town, Yosemite Sam.  The abrasive director needs to find some stars so he puts four of Hollywood's worst actors, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Sylvester, and Taz, through a series of screens tests.  Their goal is to increase their fame meter while beating and bashing their opponents until they're all outta fame.  Loons features Single Player, Multiplayer Madness, and Arcade modes.  The arcade mode is comprised of the seven mini-games unlocked through Single Player mode.  That's the main mode and it's the only way to unlock new levels (fifteen in all) and extra goodies.  In Single Player, you'll pick one of four Looney Tunes to play to play through every contest (Taz, Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny, or Sylvester). Gameplay is then split up among a series of challenges all involving, in some way or another, beating, whacking, and snuffing out your computer opponents.  Moving through the different levels, you'll experience a variety of different movie spoofs including takes on Apocalypse Now, Titanic, and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.  Each battle offers respawning power-ups, called gizmos.  There are usually about four different power-ups in each level, and often one or two skewed specifically for that level.  For example, you'll throw lightning bolts and chuck a discus at your enemies in the Coliseum.  Power-up ammo varies depending on the power.  Some are one-shots, others offer a half-dozen blasts.  Among the best are guns that change your enemy into a drag queen and a power-up that lets you rain down cows and anvils.  The power-ups are pretty cool and probably the best thing about fighting.  The problems come in how slow the game moves and just how boring the fights get, which I'll get into in just a few paragraphs.  Uh, okay.  To make things interesting on each level, there are level-specific events, called props.  Sam, the director, will announce that a prop is active.  A funnel of stars will appear near the prop and whomever gets there first will activate said prop.  Props include things like swinging from a vine and saving a damsel in distress to hopping on a gun turret and mowing down your rivals.  While the prop idea is great, it becomes a bit too easy to predict the next prop to be activated, allowing you (especially in single-player mode) to camp out by that prop so you can be the one to get the added fame.  And yeah, that's the main purpose of these props.  Most let you harm your enemies, and all of them can increase your fame meter, because you're basically taking center stage.  And, after all, that's the whole premise of the game -- becoming uber-famous.  The controls are about as simple as you can get.  X is for a speed burst, Y drops the Gizmo in hand, B jumps, and A attacks.  When you are without a gizmo, your character will attack with a hand-to-hand implement.  The choice of these is a little strange as Bugs Bunny walks around with a frying pan and Taz hits people with a bone.  Never do you get to see Taz spin around like a Tasmanian devil, which is disappointing, since that's what he's known for.  The game excels in its humor.  Each character has a variety of humorous things to say, both when hit by a gizmo or when whapping an opponent.  Characters have different outfits for each theme, so Daffy busts out the spy gear for the Mission: Impossible spoof and Bugs dawns a cowboy hat for the westerns.  The presentation is great and the humor is top notch, which makes it a real shame that the game itself gets boring fast.      Far too often in single-player mode, you'll find yourself running in circles trying to get at the last remaining enemy.  With four characters on screen it can get a little hectic (and hectic is good), but one-on-one the game becomes a tedious battle of thumping one another.  There's so much I want to like here, but there are some significant failings in the gameplay department.  For starters, your attacks are incredibly limited by only being able to attack in one way.  You can't pick up objects (though they can be destroyed through battle) and you can't grab your opponent.  Characters don't have anything special about them at all.  Taz and Bugs seem to play the same.  If only there was a special move specific to each character, like a Taz spin, the game might have had more to offer.  Because fighting is limited to smacking A constantly, it gets repetetive and boring and frankly the game feels very slow.  There needed to be a faster pace, perhaps even a timer, and more aggressive gameplay from the AI.  Multiplayer is a tad better, but you'll have to bust through single player if you want to unlock all the levels.  With four friends the game can offer some solid chuckles and good bits of rivalry.  But in the end, even with four of you going at it, the game can't offer enough to keep you coming back for more than a few matches.  Because once the novelty wears off (see something once, it's funny, see it again and it's not so entertaining anymore), the game becomes a drag.  Mini-games are also added to allow a change of pace in-game.  If your character's fame meter maxes out, a star appears on the ground.  Step on it and you'll start a mini-game.  Each theme has its own game (7 total as every theme encompasses two to three levels).  The mini-games couldn't come at a worse time as they totally separate you from the fight you're in.  Still, each character is a part of the mini-game and it's an easy way to do some serious damage.  The best of these games is a top-down ~bull fight~ that actually plays like Tron.  Here each bull has its own line left in its wake.  The idea is to get the other guy to crash into a line before you do.  Fun!  One cool incentive to push through the single player mode despite the somewhat weak computer AI are all the special features.  Stills, extra music, and clips of classic Looney Tunes can be unlocked by playing through the Single Player mode.  A great addition and honestly the only reason I forced myself to keep playing even though I got bored towards the end of each match.  Tron on bulls  Graphics Loons uses the same pseudo-cel-shading as Taz: Wanted.  It looks sort of like cel-shading, but at the same time it doesn't have quite the same 2D gloss of most cel-shaded games.  It's not a bad look at all and is perfectly cartoony.  The stages are a pretty good size for a fighting game but on some levels the environment will hide the action.  The camera can only pull out and in, so you can be stuck fighting someone and not being able to see what happens.  The animations are short and quick and really the humor is left to the effects rather than the characters themselves.  There's some slowdown when four players are going at it, which just shouldn't be there considering how little is really going on in the game.  The graphics aren't hard to look at, but nothing special.  Sound Plenty of great voice-overs and the characters offer specific comments for each level, which is great.  The music needs to be more present and more energetic.  The often barren score leaves the game feeling even emptier than it already is.  Sound effects are decent, though actually not as Looney Tunes as one would expect.  Though in 5.1, the sound field is really light for the most part.  But hey, you have to applaud the effort to at least go surround.  The sub woofer could use some loving too, but that ain't happening here. I wanted Loons to be great.  The premise was there, the presentation was solid, but the fighting was ill-conceived.  Too simple, too bland, and too boring to be recommended.  Adding grabs and throws, or even the ability to pick up and chuck objects would have helped greatly.  The game also needs some afterburners.  Powerstone played fast, this one limps along far too often. As I said in the beginning, a madcap fighting game needs speed, frenzy, and tension.  Loons is slow, and while there are moments of hectic play they don't last very long.  And really, the killer is a lack of tension.  There's never much of a feel of urgency in what you do, because the matches seem unending at times.  Add to this that there are only four playable characters -- Unacceptable for any fighting game.  If you are an absolute die-hard Looney Tunes fan, rent it first.  Otherwise, this one is best left alone (or bought at a garage sale for $5).", "date": "Oct 3, 2002"}
