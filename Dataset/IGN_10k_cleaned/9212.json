Whether a digital dog, or cat, or make-believe monster, you have to feel like you're really able to interact with the animal if you're going to have any fun at all. That ability to bond, to build an emotional investment, is an essential, non-negotiable gameplay element. Animates doesn't have it.   Animates claims to be a virtual pet experience, but it's just a hollow shell of what a virtual pet experience should be. Ponderously slow, excessively boring and altogether uncreative, it comes across as more of a work-in-progress demo of what should ultimately be a fleshed-out gameplay design. Which is unfortunate, because the basic idea behind the game isn't all that bad  the DS virtual pet genre is already flooded with ~realistic~ titles that try to simulate raising real-world pets like puppies, kittens, and ponies, so a title focused instead on made-up monster creatures could have made a mark.   Those monsters number five, which are your choices from the start in Animates. You can pick to play with a blue hippo/bunny thing, a dinosaur/dog of some kind, a cat-like lion cub lookalike and more. The animals are more closely related to the designs of monsters from the Pokemon series than any real-world mammals, and, also uniquely, you can choose to care for more than one  Animates offers the option to care for up to five different creatures simultaneously, if you can handle the hassle.     But things quickly fall apart in Animates after that opening spark of potential  because, after sitting through a loading screen (yep, loading screens) you find yourself staring at the lifeless, evergreen landscape that will be your constant viewpoint from then on out. Your Animate hatches out of an egg, then just sits there. Really, literally sits there, doing nothing. The game doesn't let you start playing until the creature has ~looked around,~ and, an eternity later, control finally defaults to you.   Sort of. You get the power to tap the screen, but doing that doesn't make any real impact on your creature, and doesn't initiate any interaction either. You're sitting there, staring at your Animate, and you can't pet it, or play with it, or anything. The only thing your touch screen poking does is mildly direct the creature's attention to a location on the screen, which it will then begin to slowly walk to. Sloooowly. Animates move at the pace of a sleepwalking, leprous slug covered in molasses. It's painfully slow.   And painfully repetitive, as you're constantly tasked to keep tap-tap-tapping on the touch screen to move it one more inch toward its ultimate goal. If you don't, it'll just stop and sit. And do nothing. Virtual pet games, again, are all about interaction with your digital creatures  but Animates doesn't have that at all. Instead, it forces you to become the brain for these mindless cartoon automatons, and renders even the most basic of your commands either frustratingly ineffective, or altogether useless.   There's some redeeming value in the game's character designs, which are fair, and the game's music, which is pleasant. But you'll be so bored after just the first few minutes that you just won't care. There are mini-games to find and play, but it takes half an hour of trudging blindly about the nondescript map to locate them, and they're all just as dull and uninspired as the core design. And the elements of taking care of your Animate, what should be the focus of fun for any good virtual pet game, are equally idiotic  feed the animal by just making it walk near the food. Make it drink by tapping close to a water source. Have it go to the restroom by tapping on, yes, the outdoor outhouse  but, by the way, there's only one of those, so if you travel to go and play the mini-games your animal will end up sick with a bladder infection before you're able to get them back across the plains to relieve themselves again.It's really just awful. There's no reason for anyone to go anyway near a copy of Animates, which, if you weren't convinced of enough already, also features a couple of programming glitches that can cause your creature to clip through parts of the environment. There could be a place in the DS system's library of virtual pet games for a title that focused on raising make-believe creatures, but Animates is far from filling that role  because this design completely misses out on the entire point of virtual pet games in the first place. Interaction. Connection. Establishing bonds. Animates doesn't have it, so don't let it have your money.", "date": "Oct 11, 2007"}
