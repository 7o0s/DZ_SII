Of all his creations, Go Go Ackman is probably the funniest and the sickest. The short comics, originally published in the monthly video game magazine V-Jump, chronicle the tales of a demonic young lad and his sidekick devil who kill the innocent, collect their souls in a jar, and then hock them to Satan. An angel named Tenshi-kun plays Elmer Fudd to Ackman's Bugs and usually ends up killing more people than he succeeds in saving. Are you starting understand why this series never made it out of Japan?    Banpresto made the most of the comic's fleeting popularity, churning out four games in under a year. The grand finale, Go Go Ackman 3, was his most twisted adventure yet. After besting the Christian rock group, the Metal Angels, in the second game, this chapter pits our anti-hero against a new nemesis, the archangel Raguel, head of the Angel Police  who also happens to be a leather-clad pederast with a thing for Ackman. In order to avoid being ~touched by an angel,~ Ackman is forced to pair up with his long time rival, Tenshi-kun, opening the doors for tag-team character switching and new gameplay opportunities.    Like its predecessors, this is a side-scrolling platformer with an action bent, vaguely in the mold of Mega Man, but with a variety of weapons like guns, swords, and boomerangs. Creativity is the order of the day, and much like the 16-bit greats by Konami and Treasure, Ackman 3 is loaded to the brim with giant bosses and crazy variety stages, including a forward-scrolling rail shooter and a top-view scavenger hunt. The short stages and frequent changes in direction really help stave off the repetition and ennui that can kill so many hardcore action games.    In the grand 16-bit tradition, you'll still face some tough opposition in your quest to save Ackman's sweet ass. You are up against the forces of God, after all. Luckily, it isn't as bad as the previous two games, thanks in part to the more frequent checkpoint. There's also a lot less cheapness to the enemy patterns, so it doesn't feel nearly as necessary to memorize the levels to survive.    WTF.  If there's any major flaw with Ackman, it's that the gameplay isn't nearly as original as the story. By the end of the 16-bit era, nearly every trick in the platformer book had been exhausted, and the formula is unchanged here. The developers have tried valiantly to steal from the best, and the result is a playable, charming, and well-paced game, but don't expect much in the way of originality. Still, on a platform where Donkey Kong Country sold millions, innovation clearly isn't everything, and a great world and cast of characters do more than enough to carry the experience.    It really feels like Banpresto finally found their groove with this title. While the earlier games in the series were promising but flawed, Ackman 3 has the whole package. Hilarious cut scenes bridge every plot point, the sprites are brimming with personality and stay very true to Toriyama's designs, and even the music is the kind of infectious stuff you'll be whistling involuntarily for the rest of the day. It's too bad nothing ever came of that ~Go Go Ackman 4~ teaser at the end.Ackman is Bart Simpson and Charles Manson rolled up into one, and a rare venture into the realm of dark comedy for a nation usually more occupied with the wacky and weird. It's one of the few licensed platformers to manage greatness, and it's a shame it never made it our shores. The growing import library on the Virtual Console offers a glimmer of hope for the future, but something tells me the Walmart crowd still isn't ready for this bad boy.", "date": "Mar 28, 2008"}
