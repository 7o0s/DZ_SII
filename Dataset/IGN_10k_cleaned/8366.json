Yes, people 'oooh' and 'aaaah' when they fly up in the air and explode. But fireworks also have a tendency of going off in your hand or tricking you into thinking they're a dud when in fact they're waiting to explode and set fire to your trousers. The sooner fireworks are banned, the better really.   Thank goodness for Boom Boom Rocket then, a virtual firework show that doesn't result in third-degree burns or permanent scarring. For those that haven't been following the progress of BBR, it's Bizarre Creations's much-anticipated XBLA follow-up to the obscenely popular and enjoyable Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved. However, rather than blasting spaceships with lasers, BBR sees you detonating fireworks in time to a series of remixed classical tunes. Think of it as a more explosive Dance Dance Revolution.   Unfortunately none of the fireworks explode into the shape of a gibbon.  Talking of Dance Dance Revolution, it's worth noting that the DDR beat runs right through BBR. Both feature directional arrows that move toward a bar indicating when to press the corresponding button, matching the rhythm of the tune. If you get the beat spot-on, you're treated to a higher score and some vaguely congratulatory on-screen message. Poorly timed presses result in a lower score while a missed beat reduces your health bar. Get too many misses and it's Game Over.   Not only do Boom Boom Rocket's fireworks create the visual pyrotecnics, they mimic the trajectory and speed of their real-life counterparts as they approach the bar. This means there are times when they slow down unexpectedly just as you're about to detonate. Other times, fireworks can overtake their neighbours, meaning you've really got to keep your eyes open and reactions primed. It's a little frustrating at first, with sudden adjustments to your strategy necessary, but that's where practice comes into play.   Boom Boom Rocket is entertaining in short bursts of explosive fun.  Of course, Boom Boom Rocket isn't a dance mat game. Instead, input uses either the 360 pad's D-pad or face buttons to obliterate rockets interchangeably. Fireworks are shaped like arrows to indicate a direction on the d-pad and are coloured red, blue, green or yellow just like the buttons. The ability to use either face buttons or d-pad together is crucial in later stages, if you're going to get through rapid song sections. In fact, most of BBR's appeal comes through pushing yourself and the speed of your fingers to earn higher scores and better grades for each song. Thanks to the addition of an online leaderboard, as is the nature of these things -- we imagine -- the pursuit of highscores could become an addictive for some, driving them to play extended sessions.     But problematically, BBR fails to provide any real sense of progression. From the start, there are 10 different levels to choose from -- each accompanied by its own piece of music -- and each can be played on three difficulty settings. By completing a level with a suitably high score, you unlock new firework patterns, like a musical note or the Bizarre Creations logo. These different fireworks then randomly appear in future displays, rewarding dedication with more spectacular pyrotechnics. Unfortunately you're almost always much too busy focusing on the correct button combinations to notice much of what else is going on in the game -- and therein lies one of the big problems with the whole experience.    Fireworks are pretty but like a supermodel they lack substance.  Gameplay is simple enough to pick up and play, and there are some moments where the experience clicks together. But break it down this way -- without the dancing DDR would be pretty uninspiring, and that's more or less the main gameplay premise of BBR. And given that the button combinations come thick and fast you'll barely notice the explosions -- let alone the cityscape below -- so on top of the basic gameplay being simplistic, there's little in the way of visual feedback or reward.   Worst of all, nothing the player does truly interacts with the music. It's just up, down, up, down, left, left, boom boom (somewhere in the background). Games like Guitar Hero and Amplitude have achieved greatness because of the tangible sense of aural feedback in the game -- the player directly creates or affects the music, and the experience. BBR has none of this and the appeal of the game suffers greatly as a result.    This might be more forgivable if Boom Boom Rocket hit the musical nail on the head. Rather than Gitaroo Man's burst of Japanese insanity or Guitar Hero's hair rock though, Bizarre has opted for generic synth remixes of classical orchestral pieces such as Ride of Valkyries and the William Tell Overture. Admittedly, it all works perfectly well from a technical standpoint, with music timed well to the onscreen cues, but there just isn't that creative hook present in the song selection. At the end of the day, music games live or dies by their song roster.   In fact the only real incentive to play on is the online ranking system, and possibly unlocking new fireworks (for those of us with three eyes). Compare it to the likes of Elite Beat Agents on Nintendo DS or Gitaroo Man and, despite its colourful firework-themed demeanour, BBR lacks that important imaginative spark.   Boom Boom Rocket varies from mildly entertaining to frustratingly repetitive, and one can't help but look at the game as step back for the music genre. Gameplay is easy to get into but there just isn't enough variety, depth or visual/aural spark to keep things interesting. A real missed opportunity when you consider how fertile a creative ground Xbox Live Arcade is for innovation in this kind of genre.", "date": "Apr 12, 2007"}
