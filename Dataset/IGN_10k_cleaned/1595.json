In description this sounds like a keen design...who doesn't want to screw up the competition on their way to first place? When the game was introduced to the Genesis market, the design in action just fell flat and lifeless despite some harsher edges in ~attitude.~ Later versions for the more powerful 3DO and PlayStation systems added more and better elements to the idea, but the game's never been one to floor folks in terms of sheer, intense fun. Though graphically impressive and competently programmed, the Game Boy Color is a chance to show gamers just how boring the game really was when it hit the scene almost a decade ago. Features Eight bikes Five tracks Three weapons Password save Only for Game Boy Color  There's not much to explain about the gameplay to Road Rash -- hop on a bike, head down the winding road, punch out a few opponents, and hope that your skills will keep you riding through the finish line in first place. The higher the position you come in, the more prize money you take home. The more money you get, the better and faster the bike you can snag. Opponents aren't exactly pushovers, as they're out to do to you what you're going to do to them: send you skidding across the pavement. They'll pull out weapons like a nightstick and chains to do it, but a well-timed punch and you can turn it all around...you can grab his weapon and thrash a few cyclists with the added power. The game's a competition against 13 other opponents and one cop. If you hit the finish line at third place or better on a specific track, you've qualified on that race. Get all five tracks at third or better and it's off to the next, harder and faster level.  The Game Boy Color version of Road Rash is based around the sequel to the Genesis game, which is a much better choice since the sequel included weapon stealing to the mix. The game uses the traditional ~3D~ racing perspective that the Game Boy Color can seem to handle...the same kind you find in such titles as Top Gear Pocket and Wacky Racers. The engine 3D6 put together is fast, smooth, produces wild hills and jumps, and can handle a group of three cyclists on screen...along with the necessary roadside objects to line the course. The controls are also tight -- usually it's the steering that make this type of racing game hit or miss, but the maneuverability of the cycles is well produced, offering a nice balance of powersliding in its cornering abilities.  There's even some crosstraffic thrown in to emulate the slightly busier streets of the Genesis game. While the Game Boy Color version doesn't have the same sprite scaling engine of the original 16-bit edition, the framerate is oodles better on the handheld. Take that, Sega!  But here's the problem: the game is dull. It's always been dull. The only hook in Road Rash is the idea that you can knock your opponent off his bike. That's it. The tracks aren't all that tough to negotiate, and the cop element is more frustrating than amusing: fall over when a cop's in pursuit and the level's over. Without the punching element, Road Rash becomes a not-so-challenging, slower paced game of Hang On. And after playing that game within the arcade of Shenmue for the Dreamcast, I honestly think that Hang On is much more fun and challenging than Road Rash ever was...and is. Don't blame 3D6 for this; this is how Road Rash felt back on the Genesis, too.  The development team did offer a link cable mode, but I think that the balancing should have been tweaked to make the races a bit more competitive, like keeping the bikes close together by increasing the trailing bike's top speed. As it is, if one of the players picks a faster bike, he'll be off to the horizon and never show up on the opponent's screen...unless he takes a spill by hitting a roadside object. This mode would have been a saving grace, but it just feels thrown in.  I've never thought much of the Road Rash series on the Genesis, and the design on the Game Boy Color doesn't do anything to up my opinion on the game. The programming's great; the engine is one of the better behind-the-vehicle engines on the system. The game itself fails to excite with any intense gameplay...a game that has the potential of being a modern day, Ben-Hur Chariot Race ends up as exciting as riding a tricycle on the driveway.", "date": "Dec 6, 2000"}
