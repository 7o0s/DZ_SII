I mean, they're fun compilations, and chances are they're still the titles that you get out when Wii newbies pop around for a drink, but it's time for something meatier. Something that focuses on a single sport, and really ups the ante in terms of what motion controls can deliver.   Sadly, Table Tennis isn't that game. Why? Well, we'll get to that in a second. First up, let's talk about what the game offers. Anyone who played the 360 original would be pretty much at home here, as the basics are very much the same, only now with added motion controls! The overall game structure is pretty sparse, with a handful of tournaments to win across three difficulty levels and an exhibition mode for when you just want a quick game. You can choose from a number of players, each with his or her own stats, and more can be unlocked (along with arenas and other 'goodies') as you win matches and tournies. It's all pretty plain and lacking in flair, which is unusual for a Rockstar branded property. The focus here is definitely on gameplay, as opposed to slick menus, compelling game options or interesting characters.     Like the 360 game, this is a game that celebrates both the accessibility of ping pong - anyone, after all, can pick up a bat and start swinging, as well as the pace and technical skill of the professional game, where the ball is often hit at incredible speeds with fierce spin, from well behind the table. Spin is a huge part of this game, and it's handled in a similar way to the other version - hold in a direction on the D-pad (up for top spin, down for back spin, left or right for sideways movement) before you hit the ball to 'charge' the spin. The longer you charge, the more the ball spins and the more juice is added to your Focus Metre, which also works in the same way as on 360; moving through three stages of effectiveness, and essentially giving you extra power on shots when activated. Each type of spin has a colour associated with it, so if your opponent hits the ball and it's glowing green, you know it has top spin on it, allowing you to counter with your own top spin... if you have time that is. The ball physics are a big part of this game, and once you understand how to utilise spin, it can be a powerful force in each rally.    Still, it may seem strange that we're still pressing buttons to add spin, rather than doing it naturally via the swing itself, but that's only one part of the puzzle. Whether it's to ensure the game isn't too hard, or simply that it would take too drastic a redesign, Table Tennis on Wii doesn't even attempt to use a one-to-one system where your motions in the real world are mirrored in the game. Instead, the swing system is pretty basic and doesn't even require you to swing at the correct time. Swing early and your player will position him or herself and hit the ball when it does arrive. It definitely makes the game easier (the timing on some of those supercharged rallies would be pretty difficult after all), but it also removes the player another step from the action. As it stands, in the default control scheme there are a number of basic movements that allow you to target different sections of your opponent's court, and they work relatively well, if slightly less reliably than we would like.    The controls are decent enough, but ultimately feel like the 360 system adjusted for Wii, rather than the optimal design for the system. Mind you, there are a couple of other schemes you can choose from. The default system moves your player about the court automatically, but if you want to position him or her manually, you can, thanks to the Control Freak option, which places player control on the Nunchuk analogue stick.    The other major control option we like to call 'The Failsafe'. The game, however, calls it 'Sharpshooter', because it gives you direct control over the direction of your shots with the Nunchuk's analogue stick - just point in a direction as you hit the ball and away you go. To us, this shows a lack of confidence in the default system, and in fact, the game is more satisfying played like this, as you have far greater control over your shots. Unfortunately, by using this system, the motion controls come down to little more than swinging the Wiimote randomly in time for each shot - everything else: angle, spin and power are determined by other elements. Ultimately it's not so far away from a traditional control solution.     But what about multiplayer? Does that save the game? Well, as we've (sadly) come to expect from the vast majority of Wii titles, you can forget online. This is strictly an offline, two player affair, and it definitely has its moments. Both players, after all, have the same limitations, and the view is nicely zoomed back so you can always see what's going on, but it's just not that engaging over the long haul - the real thing is way more fun, and stumbling home after a night at the pub and trying to tell your friends about putting spin on the ball and how to direct the damn thing is more trouble than it's worth.   Finally, how does the game's presentation hold up now that it's moved to a less powerful system? While the back of the box may feature exactly the same screenshots as were found on the Xbox 360 packaging (just a little misleading there Rockstar), the game's visuals have really been pared back. Character models are a great deal less sophisticated, and the lack of detail and subtlety in the textures and lighting have stripped away a lot of the game's personality. The visuals were a big reason to play the original, and while you'll still see some good animations and facial expressions on the players, it's just a lot more bland now. At least the sound effects are still excellent.You may be thinking that we're being a little harsh on a game that's actually quite fun, and priced competitively to boot, but we're just not sold on the implementation of the motion controls, and with so few options available to the player, it's still a little on the pricey side for what you actually get.", "date": "Oct 22, 2007"}
