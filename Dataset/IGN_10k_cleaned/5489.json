Controlling the marble without a 360-enabled input is an exercise in frustration, and frustrated is what you will be when you try to cross the disconnect between using a four direction scheme and moving the marble. Pressing down makes you go down-right, for example. In sticky situations, such as negotiating a sloped ramp, it's too easy to blow it.   However, the goofs are strictly relegated to control alone. The game itself looks great. The original boards are excellently rendered with all the hellzapoppin' color of the classic arcade screen. The music is also completely in place, which was always a highlight of the original game. We desperately wish we could recommend this classic port, but with the absolutely awful control, it just wouldn't be fair to you, your cellphone bill, or the memory of this iconic arcade game.", "date": "Feb 12, 2005"}
