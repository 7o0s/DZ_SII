{"name": "Backyard Basketball", "name_review": "Backyard Basketball", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/27/backyard-basketball", "text": "It's not difficult to argue that today's video game market is geared towards a more mature audience than it was five or ten years ago. After all, the most popular games are always trying to outdo each other in realistic portrayals of violence, sexual content and other ~adult~ themes. Whether you are a fan or an opponent of these features it is easy to lose site of the fact that are large segment of the gaming population are younger children. Therefore its not surprising that upon telling people that we were currently playing a game titled Backyard Basketball a common reaction was: ~Can you play as a hooker?~ In fact, Backyard Basketball from Atari is a wholesome and colorful basketball game geared towards younger children and is in no way related to the wrestling title from Eidos that is unfortunately also labeled Backyard.   Features  Keep in mind that this game was made for children. The controls are simple, the interface is colorful, and the overall game style looks like it was pulled from the back of a box of chocolate frosted sugar bombs. There are no double pump fakes, cross dribble controls, or the option to pimp out your crib with mad accessories.   There is the option to play some simple three-on-three basketball with a racially diverse group of children and young versions of NBA stars (re: Shaq and Yao Ming made the cut but Kobe did not). The children represent a variety of ethnic groups and social backgrounds; there is even a player who shoots from his wheelchair. This is by no means what would be called a deep game, however, there are some nice features that make it stand out as more than a bare bones affair. Right from the opening menu there are a number of customization options for kiddy b-ball.    There's the option to jump directly into a game with either a ~play now~ feature or a pick-up game, though, neither of these types are saved or effect season statistics. Pick-up games give you the choice of a court, team, and players while ~play now~ randomly selects all of these for you. There are also a few mini-games including horse and around the world, a self-explanatory practice mode, and a mini-game known as ~hot shot~ that consists of players taking turns making shots from areas on the court marked with different point values.   A ~meet the players~ option allows gamers to cycle through the stars of Backyard Basketball, review their stats, read their bios and listen to some sound clips of the players talking. For example, the sweater vest clad Jorge Garcia will announce that he has more money than you. Needless to say, Jorge didn't make our team. There's a Hall of Fame section too, where all of the team and player stats are listed and they're arranged for easy navigation. Perhaps no one would complain if the game didn't include field goal percentage rankings for players by season, single games, and career mode, but it is nice to see a something for a younger audience giving a little bit extra. This is particularly noticeable in the ~goodies~ section of Backyard that hosts a list of unlockable features and bonus features.   The meat of the game is in the season play mode. Here you can choose either an NBA team name or a made-up kiddy team with names like the ~Hot Doggers.~ As one of the fake teams, players have the added option of customizing their uniforms. After selecting your team members it's time to hit the court. Once there, the difficulty setting has more to do with added in-game options than with your opponents A.I.; as the hardest setting also includes penalties, player fatigue, and substitutions. There are options to turn on power ups, adjust the period length and turn off the shot ring, as well, so there's plenty of customization for more ambitious players.   Gameplay  As one would expect, Backyard Basketball is easy to get the hang of. Nothing in the game presents a challenge for gamers over the age of 10. With the settings on hard, it's still possible to put the controller down and get a snack without many consequences besides the eventual loss of the shot clock. The court is very small, about half the size of a regular video game basketball court. This means that there is little emphasis on passing and defensive strategy. Each team basically takes turns getting the rock to the best shooter and putting up shots.    On offense you can pass, shoot, dribble fake and spin. The R and L buttons allow players to sprint, back down defenders, screen, and activate an icon-passing mode. Additionally, because the game is three-on-three it's also possible to choose exactly who gets a pass with the two action buttons. On defense there is the option to jump, steal, and switch players. On D you can also sprint and enter a defensive stance with a number of game play options well suited for young children. Since your author is a former camp counselor, he can attest to the fact that kids are only willing to pay attention to so many rules. What they really want to do is shoot the ball at the basket and that is whatBackyard Basketball is all about. The game almost made us feel a little nostalgic in the sense that it felt like a throwback to the earliest Nintendo 8-bit basketball games.   If you choose to play with power-ups icons will appear randomly on certain areas of the court. Coming in contact with the floating boxes will have certain effects on either individual players or the whole team. These include increased speed, an earthquake that will shake the ball loose from competitor's hands, and the ability to avoid possibly illegal liaisons with younger fans when your character joins the NBA in ten years. One problem we had with the power-ups, though, is that there is no explanation of what each icon will do. It becomes apparent after a few games, but in a children's game everything should be spelled out and underlined.   Graphics  The game is bright and colorful with an assortment of very simple cartoon-like characters. The players and the environments are all three-dimensional but based on looks there is very little reason to assume that this game is on PlayStation 2 instead of 1. Camera angles remain fixed on a horizontal view of the court, so technically the game's presentation is visually similar to the animated 2D PC version. Power-ups will cause players to glow, the ball to freeze and other small effects. There's a nice little instant replay feature that comes after particularly sweet shots or dunks, too, but the overall visual complexity is equivalent to an episode of Teletubbies. Then again, a lot of children out there really like Teletubbies.   Sound  The music of Backyard Basketball mostly consists of funky, synthesized background drivel. The characters shout out exclamations and directions on the court and there is background noise from the environments such as car alarms and crowd noise. There is also the cute/annoying commentating team of Sunny Day and Barry Dejay. Players will have to be very young to find these two entertaining. Luckily, the audio in the game is broken down into seven different categories that can be turned on and off separately.A game that is developed for a younger audience should still adhere to the conventions of what makes a good video game. However, when the target age of a game dips below the range of teenager, those standards have to be adjusted accordingly. Not many eight year-olds are going to be disappointed at the lack of a solid franchise mode or the graphical details of Paul Pierce as a child. Backyard Basketball is a dose of sugarcoated simplicity but overall it is a decent sports title for young children.", "date": "Oct 27, 2003"}
