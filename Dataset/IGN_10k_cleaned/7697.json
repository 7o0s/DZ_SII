Both Gears and COD3 have ably demonstrated that Microsoft's next-gen console has well-and-truly hit its shooter stride. Just when we thought we couldn't handle any more face-blasting action on the 360, along comes Rainbow Six Vegas to suck away any spare holiday time left after the other big games. Rainbow Six Lockdown was a point-blank shotgun blast to the Rainbow Six franchise, leaving Tom Clancy's longest running series doubled-over like a rag-doll corpse. Ubisoft obviously couldn't allow Lockdown to be at the forefront of gamer's memories of Rainbow, and have pulled out all the stops with Vegas in an effort to compensate. The result is the finest, most feature-packed game in the Rainbow series. Firing from cover pulls the camera out to a third-person perspective. Upon first heading into Ubisoft Montreal's latest effort, we were struck with an overwhelming sense of Dj vu. Sitting in the back of a chopper, gazing out the open doorway as we fly low over a dusty Mexican city, a myriad of squat shanties stretching off into the distance - hang on a minute, isn't this Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfare? As we abseil to the streets below, an RPG round blazes its way to the Black Hawk, forcing our team mates to abort their landing. We're stranded, alone, in a neighbourhood that makes Cronulla look friendly. As the camera pulls into a first person perspective, we still can't shrug off the feeling that this game feels very similar to GRAW. That's not a bad thing though, considering that GRAW is still one of the finest shooters to grace the 360. However, as we progress through this first training mission and are slowly introduced to the intricate, yet incredibly intuitive, control scheme, we start to see that where GRAW focused on long-range, outdoors combat, Vegas is all about the close quarter battle. It does have its share of wide, open spaces to give your Scout sniper rifle a bit of a work out, but where it truly shines is during the close confines that urban warriors call home. As the level progresses, we move into the claustrophobic confines of an underground tunnel system, and the game's cover system comes into its own. Split screen co-op. Take note Gears, Vertical split is the way to do it! Nothing stops hot rounds chewing through your flesh like a metre of concrete between you and the bad guys, and it's as easy to use as holding in the Left trigger. As long as you hold the trigger, your player remains safely behind cover, but still has the ability to look around corners, with the view pulling seamlessly out to a third person perspective. Lean just a little bit to the side or over the top and you can lay down a wild shower of inaccurate cover fire. Poke the stick further in that direction and suddenly you'll pop out from cover, squeezing off more accurate shots. Using this technique it's possible to line up targets without leaving cover, before popping up to take the shot. It's a more controllable system than the one seen in Gears of War and, unlike that title, we didn't experience any moments of accidentally taking cover when we should have been retreating.     The cover system is just one example of the very powerful control scheme in Vegas. We can't think of another game that allows the player to partake in so many actions with such aplomb, and that includes the previous ruler of the acrobatic roost, Sam Fisher. You'll enter battle with a comprehensive swag of equipment, each of which has multiple options, from using your snake cam to scope out the other side of doors, to fitting silencers to your weaponry, to switching between thermal and night vision. Then there's the exceptionally cool ability to rappel, and even this includes a variety of modes. Once on the rope you can swing upside down and whip out your pistol, allowing you to take out important targets as your squad mates enter from side doors. Or you could simply jump past the window to the level below. Rambo wannabes will probably make heavy use of the breach feature, smashing through windows with all guns blazing. All of these features are very easy to use, and gives the 360 controller's myriad of buttons a thorough workout, yet don't require the dexterity of a concert pianist. For the majority of the missions, you'll enter battle with two very able squad mates by your side. Squad mate AI has always been a tough area to nail, but Vegas sets a new standard for realistic, and helpful, AI behaviour. Just like your own actions, controlling their behaviour is exceptionally simple, thanks to intuitive controls and very strong AI. Whether they're clearing rooms with flashbangs or flanking a hot spot in one of the open areas, they do exactly as they're required, and are exceptionally lethal. When breaching a room that contains hostages, the ability to tag high priority targets for your squad mates ensures mission success.  Lighting effects are over the top. Just like tacky Vegas. You'll need to rely heavily on your squad mates' ability to hurt terrorists, as the enemy AI is yet another glistening bullet in the arsenal of Vegas. These masked bandits make great use of cover, spot you from far away, react to noises and events, and flank, flank, flank. Just when you think you're tucked away safely behind some cover, a sneaky terrorist will pop up at your 5 o'clock, ruining your Vegas holiday. If there's one flaw with the opposition, it's that many of them originate from the same clone army, with repeated use of the same model. We weren't expecting Vegas to dazzle our retinas like a fresh flash-bang blast, but were pleasantly surprised once it hit our HD projector. Character models, especially those of the Rainbow team, are exquisitely detailed, while the guns are some of the most accurate depictions yet seen in a game. Levels range from the large neon-bathed Vegas Strip, through to dark and atmospheric cavern systems. While the level of detail of the environments doesn't quite reach Gears levels, the fact that most objects are destructible gives each and every bullet fired a real sensation of power and impact. Slot machines churn out coins and debris when hit, glass shatters beautifully and there are more sparks and smoke clouds during a firefight than we thought the 360's GPU could handle. For the most part, it all runs smoother than a K-Bar slicing through a thin layer of Kevlar body armour. Plenty of variety in the levels ensures that the game's room-clearing core doesn't ever get stale. Just as you get tired of poking your snake cam under yet another door, the devs throw in a wide open area with hostages to save, or a cool rappelling section, keeping it feeling fresh the entire time.  What you can't see in this shot is the oozy, bloody goodness of the blood effects. Backing up the impressive visuals are the ear-shattering sound effects. Guns are deliciously oomphy, and will pound your sub-woofer into submission. There's a nice little boom after each sniper shot that will pound you in the chest, while the potty-mouthed terrorists aren't afraid to sling the F-bomb around alongside their frag grenades. The music is a great mix of annoying casino-floor tunes, capturing the feel of this surreal city, and an atmospheric, dynamic score, helping to build tension just when it's needed. The main character's voice is a little bland, but you'll barely notice it above the cacophony of gun shots.    All of these factors combine to make the single-player game shine as the finest tactical shooter on the 360. We'd even go as far as to say that it pips GRAW in this regard - fire-fights feel more frenzied, more exciting, more desperate. Yet they also feel more strategic thanks to the stellar squad mate and enemy AI. If there's one area of the single-player doesn't quite live up to GRAW, it's the storyline - or lack of one, to be precise. We're used to playing shooters where the storyline doesn't come first, but the  clichd storyline of Rainbow Six is especially disappointing. Having said that, it's easy to overlook this aspect considering how satisfying the rest of the package is.  Let's face it, the game really needed some retired pensioners attached to slot machines to fill with lead.Were getting a little sick of handing out so many high scores to 360 shooters this Christmas, but when theyre all this good itd be a travesty not to give them their deserved props. Rainbow Six Vegas joins this acclaimed bunch and stands out as the finest first-person shooter on the 360. Unlike a certain overweight, Rhinestone Jumpsuit-wearing singer, being located in the surreal city of Vegas brings out the very best of the Rainbow series.", "date": "Nov 29, 2006"}
