Namco, which enjoyed a degree of success on the iPod with the original Pac-Man, has added to Apple's itty-bitty library with a go-go edition of Ms. Pac-Man. After all, what better way for the gaming icon to celebrate a 25-year anniversary than share hard drive space with the Bee Gees and Depeche Mode?   I wasn't an enormous fan of Pac-Man on the iPod. The control scheme required you to flutter your finger around the click-wheel to manipulate the virtual joystick. Hard clicks will get you nowhere but the belly of Inky and Pinky. Ms. Pac-Man employs the same controls, and so many of the same problems have return with them. Namco offers a tutorial and an easy mode for learning the nuances of the controls, but the game still feels way too touchy to be even remotely as enjoyable as it is with a real joystick or a reasonable gaming pad.    Helping matters, though, is the simple fact that Ms. Pac-Man is a better game than the original Pac-Man. The maze designs are still wicked and the cross-screen tunnels are a huge improvement over the original game. Ms. Pac-Man also offers challenges with tougher ghosts and fruit bonuses that move around the maze.   On the iPod, you can listen to your own music while crashing about the mazes or enjoy the original sounds. The game has a handful of modes, from easy to original, which replicates the arcade classic down to the pixel.  Even though Ms. Pac-Man is a better game than the original Pac-Man, it's still hobbled by the click-wheel. Let's face it -- the click-wheel is not a good controller for action games that require precise movements like, well, Ms. Pac-Man. If you want to download a game or two for your iPod, there are better choices -- but if you must have a pellet-gobbler, definitely choose Ms. Pac-Man over Pac-Man.", "date": "Jun 1, 2007"}
