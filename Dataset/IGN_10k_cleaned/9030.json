Sony Bend and SCE took Gabe Logan out of console retirement and placed him in an action packed portable title that really highlighted the PSP, showing what the system could do.  Not only did it prove that a shooter could work on the system without a second analog stick, it featured a robust multiplayer mode that took advantage of the system's features.  We liked it so much, we gave the title an Editor's Choice Award when it came out last March, and 2006's Game of the Year Award.   Obviously, when we found out that the title was making its way over to the PS2, we were excited to experience the game back on a console.  We couldn't wait to see how the game controlled and if there were any changes that would be made to the PS2 title.  Unfortunately, we were somewhat disappointed by what we found.  While it's still an impressive title by all accounts, the lack of the online play and minor visual adjustments makes the port less than it really should've been.    Dark Mirror, of course, follows Gabe Logan around the world as he deals with a para-military group known as Red Section that has managed to get their hands upon a new secret weapon.  Of course, this threatens the safety of the world, and requires the Agency's best agent, his partner Lian Xing and their fellow agents to defeat these terrorists before they can unleash its power.  Across seven episodes and numerous chapters, Gabe and Lian will fight their way through dozens of enemies, collecting information and even discovering secrets of Gabe's past that return to haunt him.  As Juan said in his review of the PSP title, the story itself isn't particularly original or unique, but the manner in which the tale is told is particularly striking, especially with its mix of flashbacks, narrative and voice acting that is impressive.   Yet, there is a caveat that has to be given with the PS2 version of the title - the visuals aren't particularly improved or cleaned up from the PSP version of the game, which were really designed to take advantage of the portable system's sharp screen.  As a result, some cutscenes, in-game movies and other gameplay images can look stretched, blurry or unimpressive when placed on a normal television screen.  Considering the fact that the new PSP Slims can run the UMD title on a television as it would appear on the LCD screen, this is a serious letdown.  What's more, it appears that some elements, such as the motion of the cutscenes, seem somewhat faster in the PS2 than on the original PSP UMD.  As a result, some of the dialogue syncing and story elements can run a bit behind the onscreen action.  It's rather disappointing, especially compared to the incredible presentation found on the portable.   On a mission. Of course, with the transition over to the console, players could finally take advantage of some of the elements that weren't available in the portable version.  No longer are you forced to use the face buttons on the controller to direct your aim, nor are you dependent upon auto-target locks to help you out in the midst of battle when you've got multiple enemies to target.  In fact, now that there's a second analog stick, there's a minimal focus upon using the face buttons within battle.  For the most part, the PS2 version does its job nicely, but it isn't anything particularly stunning with the control scheme.  In fact, you'd expect the controls to be a bit tighter because of the additional buttons, and it satisfies that decently well, particularly thanks to the fact that you can hit the R2 button instead of the up directional arrow to reload a weapon.  You don't have to fight your way against the controls at any point in time.  It's extremely intuitive, particularly if you've played an action title on the PS2.    While the controls might be intuitive, there are a number of adjustments that have also been made to the PS2 version of the game that are somewhat difficult to understand.  For example, some battle sequences are easier to complete, thanks to the addition of the second analog stick, because it's easier and at times a bit more precise to use the analog stick than pressing face buttons and continually adjusting your aim.  Does that make it better than the PSP scheme?  Not necessarily.  But the Dual Shock does exactly what you'd expect it to do in the midst of battle.  Then again, some other sequences are a lot easier to finish than you'd expect.  For instance, the final battle against Singularity is much easier to complete because there are basically no trains that ever move along the tracks that could interrupt your shots or potentially run you over.   Now, there are some other adjustments that seem to run anathema to the basic concepts of the franchise.  For instance, if you've ever played one of the previous Syphon Filter titles, you know that one of the classic facets of the title, as minor as it may be, was the option to stealthily set your opponents on fire with the taser.  For some reason, that feature has been removed from the PS2 version of the game.  Considering that it was a tactic that you could use within the PSP title, it's odd that the port has had this stripped from the game entirely.  In some ways, this almost removes the enjoyment that you have with using the taser in the game, and if you're going to perform stealth kills, you almost rely upon the knife, which shows brutal animations even if there's no blood to be seen.  That doesn't really help when you consider that one of the badges that you can acquire is for stealth kills, and the reason to pull those off is somewhat diminished.    Then again, perhaps one of the largest strikes against the PS2 version of Dark Mirror has to be the lack of the multiplayer mode.  The PSP title provided both ad hoc and infrastructure play, with four on four matches across Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Objective and Rogue Agent Modes.  Not only was there an impressive lobby system that allowed players to quickly and easily join matches, create clans and host games, but you could leap into firefights and improve your stats, unlocking new weapons to use in the various maps online.  It was one of the strongest titles that used the multiplayer aspects of the PSP to its fullest extent.  As a result, you'd expect that the PS2 version would carry on that tradition, featuring a solid gameplay experience that would rival that of SOCOM or any other popular online game.   Unfortunately, you're in for a large disappointment, especially since there is no online mode to be found within the PS2 version of the game.  While you don't expect the inclusion of Ad Hoc play, you'd at least think that SCE and Sony Bend would provide some servers for those players to leap online and build a PS2 community around the game.  This is especially true considering that the game is still frequently played on the PSP.  For some reason, this has been completely removed.  That maybe a design decision to make players realize the death of online play via the PS2 sooner rather than later is unknown, but for a first party title that made a large impact with multiplayer play, the exclusion of the feature is a gigantic letdown.  It also cuts down on the replayability of the title, particularly when you realize that after you've beaten the title multiple times and completed all of the badges, you don't have anyone else to test your skills against.   Look out. It's dramatic. All of that brings me to the final point, which is that this port of Dark Mirror doesn't really take advantage of the PS2 in any way.  The PSP version of the game highlighted the system - how incredibly the screen could display this kind of fast-paced action, the multiplayer aspects for the PSP, and the excellent control scheme.  On the PS2, however, the game comes across like a basic shooter without any significant elements that pushes the genre in any way.  Even 2004's Syphon Filter: Omega Strain provided online elements and a ton of weapons to showcase a new direction for the series.  With this bare bones port, this seems more like a minor side chapter in the series.The PSP version of Dark Mirror was truly an incredible experience, but its port to the PS2 leaves a lot to be desired.  Some grainy visuals, removed gameplay elements and easier sections makes the title somewhat weaker.  The largest issue, of course has to be the missing multiplayer, which added so much replay value.  While it's still an enjoyable title, particularly for the incredible story and the presentation of the game world, this is by no means as solid as its UMD counterpart.", "date": "Sep 13, 2007"}
