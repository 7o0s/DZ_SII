While the movie may not be fresh in theaters, a gamer scrolling through crowded decks will identify known quantities -- and for this reason, Digital bridges new racer, The Fast and the Furious should see major downloads.   And we should also be seeing plenty of happy gamers.   Features:   Features Vin Diesel  Upgrade your ride in the Chop-Shop  Twelve tracks   What we have here is a game that is neither fast nor furious, but it most certainly fun. It delivers little sense of speed -- not Digital Bridges fault, as handset tech is still pretty limited -- but the top-down racing mechanics are very solid. Think of that old Super Sprint cabinet at the convenience store and you'll have a good idea about game play. And considering how many quarters were dropping into that game, it's not a bad game to be compared to.   Where The Fast and the Furious succeeds in capturing the essence of its source material is in the production values and other game play elements. The game nails the street racing scene stuff from the movie, as you are able to customize your ride and tear up city streets.   The customization element is basic, but it works. Between races, you can spend your prize money on vehicle upgrades like engine, tires, acceleration, steering, and nitro. Even better, you can actually see the difference the additions make to your car while racing. A new engine and accelerator really does make your car zoom around the city faster.   Back to the racing: it's good -- as soon as you get used to the controls with the touchpad. But as soon as you figure out cornering, you'll be winning races with the best of them. While tearing up the twelve tracks, you can collect additional cash bonuses by driving over them.   And a word about the other drivers. They're jerks. They driver hard and have no reservations about steering into you or cutting you off as you approach a corner. The only way to win is do unto other before they do it to you.   The Fast and the Furious looks pretty solid. Digital bridges paid for the likeness of Vin Diesel, and his mug pops up from time to time to count down races and offer hints and tips. The tracks are decently details with sand and water hazards, as well as bad weather. The other cars have different paint jobs, too, so it's easy to not get lost in the pack.Digital Bridges, you deserve some serious applause. This was not an easy franchise to pull off on phones. After all, look how long it's taken for the The Fast and the Furious to reach consoles. The game play is good, control is tight, and all of the trimmings that link it to the movie are present.
