{"name": "K-1 The Arena Fighters", "name_review": "K-1 The Arena Fighters", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/09/04/k-1-the-arena-fighters", "text": "There was a cool mid-'80s movie called    Gymkata, where this guy combined    gymnastics and martial arts and kicked a lot    of butt. It was typical of bad '80s American    kung fu movies, like American Ninja 3    (featuring Lucinda Dickey of Breakin'    fame), and didn't really do anything to    further the genre made famous by Bruce    Lee and Jackie Chan. What does all this    have to do with K-1 The Arena Fighters?    Nothing really, we just wanted to bring up    some bad old movies.     K-1 The Arena Fighters, a polygonal    fighter from T-HQ, attempts to take the international sport of    kickboxing and transfer it into 3D    polygons. Developer X-ing has chosen to go for an    almost sim-like treatment of the sport,    dispensing with crazy fireballs and combos    for good, old fashioned punching and    kicking.  This is all well and good, but the game fails miserably. Each fighter has two meters, one for strength and one for stamina. The more your punch and kick, the less strong your blows are. You're forced to time your attacks so as to get the most out of them. OK, we respect X-ing for trying something different, but it just isn't any fun holding back.   Stick with Street Fighter and Tekken. If you really want to experience kickboxing, go take some lessons.", "date": "Sep 4, 1997"}
