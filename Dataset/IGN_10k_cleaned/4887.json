It's pretty rare for publishers to make any big changes at all on the little handheld system the second time out -- they usually just take the old engine and spin up some new levels that hopefully are more fun than last time. You don't see them change developers often, and when they do, you still usually don't get a better game for the change (we call this the Blitz Effect.) But, oh mommy, did Disney Interactive make a good turn with this one -- new developer, new gameplay approach, and like an episode of The Swan, the second Kim Possible GBA title is a total hottie.   Features  Based on the hit Disney animated show  20 stages, including special skating and flying levels  Five gadgets and multiple techniques to acquire  Battery save with auto-save     Whatever I was expecting when I saw A2M as the developer on the box (who's last game cartoon-based game was the melty Ice Age), it went over quick from the first play of Kim Possible 2: Drakken's Demise. There's a level of polish and stage design on this title that's rare for the handheld, much less a 'kiddie' game meant for girls and tweens. From the battery save (which automatically saves progress after each stage -- nice little bit of sugar there) to the sprawling levels full of secret collectibles and hidden paths to the special techniques Kim learns that make revisiting stages a whole lot of fun the second time through, this dev team gave this girl some pampered treatment.   Kim Possible 2 ditches everything from the original -- instead of a side-scrolling brawler, this new game is more of an action platformer that emphasizes Kim's gymnastic skills more than her fisticuffs. She'll be leaping through the air, grabbing onto a monkey bar, swinging off of a flagpole, and flipping off of the side of a wall ... often all in the same move, and she may even throw in a flying kick at the end. The shift to platforming does all kinds of good for this game's complexion -- stages are gigantic, and have Sonic-style routes through them with lots to seek out and collect after your first run-through.    Gadgets are this girl's best friend, and her friend Wade is there with a number of them throughout the game. Most of the gadgets in this game are sort of useless -- although you will find some clever uses for the ice-melting Hot Sauce and the gummy Glue Lipstick if you explore -- but the Grappling Hook is a whole other story. Sure, it's ripped right out of Bionic Commando, but anybody who's played that Capcom classic knows how much fun swinging through the air and tossing a hook out at the last second can be, and this game makes swell use of the hook as well. Between this hook and all of Kim's special techniques (such as the wall-bounce the cartwheeling long-jump), this game has all of the control you could wish for.    The animated series that this game comes off of doesn't give a lot of room for visual trickery, so the developers wisely concentrated on the animation -- Kim's moves come off with all of the fluidity of the TV series, and there's some nice touches in enemy animation as well (such as how laser light plays off their suits when they fire at you.) The story sequences, told with cut-scene stills and 'codec' chat pop-ups, actually makes some sense across the multiple episodes that this game is broken up into (for some reason, story writing takes usually takes a backseat in handheld designing.) And the soundtrack is laid out by the masters at Shin'en -- their multitrack MIDI-style tune stylings have lost a little luster with advancements in digital GBA audio, but what's here is still pretty sharp.Kim Possible 2 has got it going on. The only itch in this sitch?Her game can get flipping hard! Not hopelessly difficult, mind you --it's certainly not the toughest game I've hit on for GBA, and thepiled-on challenges are almost always fair -- but for the youngsters andtween'age girls who are fans of the show, it can get to be an impossiblemission. Even if you're not trying to collect all the goodies in a stage(and good luck if you are -- levels are packed with as many as to 250collectible trinkets), it's still a long crawl to the end of every stage-- they could have done levels half as long and still had a really fungame that everybody could play.Funny thing is, this deserving sleeper might actually find a secondfanbase. You've got a platformer with polished design, tight control,plenty of replayability, and a hot gal in the lead role as thebutt-kicking, high-flying, belly-shirt-sporting hero chick. ThinkCastlevania set in So-Cal, or Catwoman with some class.It's certainly a game that you gamer boys shouldn't be ashamed ofpicking up ... if you think you can keep up with her.", "date": "Aug 5, 2004"}
