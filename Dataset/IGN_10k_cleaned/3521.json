They have compelling storylines, sophisticated characters and most importantly, lots of action. But what happens when you make a Tom Clancy game from scratch, no book or idea to draw inspiration from? Well, you might end up with a game like Splinter Cell.   Splinter Cell puts gamers in the role of Sam Fisher, a secret Black-Ops government spy/assassin/ninja/George Clooney look-a-like. Two CIA agents have gone missing in Georgia (no, not that Georgia), and it is up to Sam to unravel the tangled web of mystery behind their sudden disappearance. Intriguing, no?  First making an appearance on Microsoft's big black box last November, Splinter Cell made a name for itself with its stealth-based gameplay and awe-inspiring visuals. Being one of the best-selling titles of last holiday season, ports were sure to follow, and now, six months later, Splinter Cell has arrived on Sony's not-so-big black box. Does the game do justice to its technically superior older brother? Absolutely.  Gameplay It's impossible to talk about Splinter Cell without mentioning the gameplay contributions served up by the game's graphics. Frankly, much of the gameplay is directly affected by what the lighting system has to offer. See, Splinter Cell is really all about darkness. Yes, the same darkness that keeps many frightened children awake at night as they lay under their Star Wars sheets and rationalize their parent's decision of the  absence of a nightlight. Unlike other games where the environments are lit by some mysterious light source, Splinter Cell does a respectable job of reproducing real lighting behavior, from pitch darkness to illuminated neon heaven, comparable to that of the intersection at Shibuya station in Downtown Tokyo.     More than just a visual gimmick, the light (or lack thereof) can be your friend...and enemy. Hiding in shadows is the key to survival, from both an offensive and defensive angle, and after becoming accustomed to obscurity, the first trace of light beaming from a all too innocent light bulb will trigger an instinctual reaction to pull out a gun and end its miserable existence. In fact, after spending some quality time with the game, I found the lights in the IGN parking lot to be a little threatening...  Splinter Cell is about stealth. But being a covert spy means not only moving in and out of situations like a ghost, but also covering your tracks.   Anytime a body is found, suspicion is aroused and/or an alarm is set off, so concealing them with dark shadows should always be part of the game plan. In the Xbox game, setting off one alarm often meant the end of a mission. While not necessarily bad design, problems arose when a body was found at an earlier part in the level and there was no way to go back due to automatic checkpoints. This resulted an endless cycle of the mission ending, starting the mission over, then having the mission end once the body was found again. Fortunately, a new three alarm system was implemented in to game and allows up to three alarms to be set off before ending a mission. This helps immensely and rids the game of the cheap death cycle.      For better or worse, much of the level design was also altered from the Xbox Splinter Cell. Most of the time, the changes in level layout/character placement are beneficial to the player and give the game a more balanced feel. There are less unavoidable enemy encounters, as well as a decrease in excruciatingly difficult combat situations. But this very change is a double-edged sword. Though the game feels more thought out and play-tested, the game is also substantially easier. Gone are the genuinely difficult situations that require skill and precision. Instead, what is left are stripped-down and over-simplified situations that require little, if any skill. For example, one level has you crossing a minefield while avoiding a searchlight, as well as the prying eyes of several enemy soldiers. In the Xbox game, this was one of the more difficult areas to pass. Shooting a guard or the searchlight would cause mayhem to ensue as each soldier took their best shots at making you a fading memory, so being stealthy was essential. In the PS2 game, shooting every guard before even attempting to cross the minefield is a-ok. On top of that, there are not only less mines, but the structures in the field (crates, oil drums, etc) lend themselves to a much easier crossing. Just about every challenging scene in the game has been altered in a similar way. It's too bad a good balance of difficulty couldn't be found when redesigning the levels.    Not all of the changes made in the game are so readily apparent, though. Take the user interface as an example. Subtle refinements in item and weapon usage go a long way in making the game play out more naturally and intuitively. In fact, the new interface is so much more instinctive that before going back and playing the Xbox Splinter Cell, the new changes were almost unnoticeable. Also, the newly added cinemas add more to the game than just a little extra visual flash. They actually add a lot of missing detail to the story and also make Sam Fisher a real person. Before, Sam was always cool. He was this super-secret government ninja. But that's it. In the PS2 game, his relationship with his daughter is fleshed out and not only is Sam cool, but now we care about him. He finally has more dimensions than the very page you're reading this review on. Amen to that.    Because we PS2 owners were left out in the cold during the last holiday season, we not only received numerous minor additions, but also an entire new level that takes place in a nuclear power plant. This new level was cleverly incorporated into the storyline and is by no means a cheap add-on. It is a full length level that actually provides one of the tougher challenges in the game. Additionally, we get to see Sam in his brand-spanking new white snow outfit, complete with ninja-like ski mask. Besides the additional level, Sam also has a set of zooming binoculars that can be used at any point in the game and come in handy on more than a few occasions.   Even with all improvements made to the game's interface and design, many of the game's flaws were left as is. Like why can't I skip cutscenes?   While seemingly a trivial issue, watching and listening to the same scene over and over again after multiple deaths will most certainly drive one up, and over a wall. Also, why can't Sam open a door while carrying a body? Opening a door, knocking someone down the hall unconscious, carrying the body back down the hall, dropping the body, opening the door, picking the body back up, and then going through the door takes more time than one would think, and is not a procedure that ever gets comfortably familiar. Additionally, while the game's AI is more-or-less competent ninety percent of the time, there are a few instances where the enemy will appear to be no smarter than a four year old child lost in a sandlot. Not a particularly big problem given that these situations are relatively rare, but worth noting.    Graphics When Splinter Cell was originally released for the Xbox, it was a graphical tour de force that made many of us rethink the way we thought about lighting and shadows in videogames. From the soft haze emanating from every light source to the pitch-black darkness that hid Sam Fisher from not only the adversary, but also the player, Splinter Cell's markedly new and radical lighting system was a sight to behold. But could the developers pull off the same feat on the PS2, a system that obviously has certain shortcomings and limitations, at least from a hardware perspective? For the most part, yes.  Splinter Cell's unmistakable lighting effects have the made the transition better than expected. While no where near as harsh or dramatic as the Xbox version, the soft lighting is in full effect, though the look is slightly altered in some instances. More like a fancy transparency than a subtle glow, there are a few illuminated objects that tend to have a more subdued shine to them. But this isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, at times it helps give the game's visuals a more realistic impression. On the Xbox, every object was blindingly brilliant and, while easy on the eyes, was a little over pronounced. On the PS2, the toned down look is actually beneficial to the game's overall visual effect. Just don't expect it to be more attractive on a superficial level.  The PS2 engine was written (mostly) from scratch and the efforts are immediately apparent. The game looks remarkably similar to its Xbox cousin, which is no small feat in itself, but to have actually added new effects into the game on top of that is even more impressive. There are now real-time reflections on surfaces and heat shimmers radiating from flame sources. But that's not to say that this game looks better than the Xbox version. As is the case with many PS2 games, aliasing issues rear their ugly heads around, though they are kept to minimum and are by no means unbearable. Also, textures are not as sharp or detailed, and the goggle effects (night vision/thermal) are noticeably of less quality. Still, Splinter Cell is one of the best looking PS2 games out there, and more importantly, the lighting scheme is just as effective and impressive as ever.   Sound Splinter Cell is more often than not a silent game. Most of the in-game playtime will consist of ambient sounds rather than a score of any sort. With this being said, the sounds in Splinter Cell are excellent. Boards creek; gravel shifts; metal bends and warp; it's all there. Simply put, the game is only as silent as you are.   Another area where Splinter Cell excels is in the voice acting, thanks in no small part to a top-notch cast, particularly Michael Ironside. His deep, smug voice and deadpan sarcasm suit Sam Fisher better than Sam's own skintight suit. The rest of the cast performs admirably, second only to Lt. Jean Rasczak himself.  Stealth: The act of moving, proceeding, or acting in a covert way. No other game encompasses this concept better than Splinter Cell. While many have accused Splinter Cell of being a victim to trial-and-error gameplay, I found that not to be the case. Close examination of the environment and slow, calculated moves led me to victory on almost every occasion. This game is about patience and observation. Without them, you'll find yourself continuously becoming frustrated and, well, dead. Because of the relatively slow nature of the game, I can't recommend Splinter Cell to everyone. But if you've ever wanted live out fantasies of being a covert government spy tangled in a web of deceit and murder, there is no other option: play this game.For those of you who've already played through the Xbox version and are wondering if this game is worth buying, the answer is maybe. Are a new level, added cinemas, and altered level designs worth a $50 purchase? For me, the answer is yes. The game plays out differently enough that I had just as much fun playing through the game as I did the first time. If the game never really tickled your fancy in the first place, I doubt any of the additional material will sway your opinion about the game.On the other hand, if you have yet to play the game and can't decide on which version to get, decide what's most important to you. Do you want a more balanced game that plays better, is a little easier, has an extra level, and tells a better story, or the prettier, more difficult game that is a little less user-friendly, but has downloadable content? The choice is yours.", "date": "Mar 24, 2003"}
