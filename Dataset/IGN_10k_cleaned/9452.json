We hate to sound as surprised as we are, but truth be told there's an astonishingly bad track record for any games geared towards girl gamers, especially here on DS.  If one of out every 50 licensed girl titles out there is actually a decent one though, we'd put this right up there with Super Princess Peach as the only truly impressive DS titles geared towards the female crowd specifically on DS.  It's not ~great~ by our standards, but it's easily the best in its class thus far, and a huge leap in the right direction for female licensed games.   Hannah Montana: Music Jam is a pretty simple concept, but its execution is surprisingly on the money.  You'll play as pre-teen sensation Hannah Montana, who is challenged by a rival teennie-bopper to win a jam contest where each team needs to learn and play instruments on-stage in competition.  In typical licensed game fashion, this basic story intro sets the stage for the rest of the game, as players hop into the life of Hannah Montana, and learn to rock out via the Nintendo DS touch screen.   Ignore this part.  Enjoy this part.   The single player game has all the typical licensed muck that makes it as annoying for us to play as it does addicting for the younger, female crowd.  You'll walk around the world as Hannah, steer your little 3D model around tiny playfields, change clothes, talk to statue-like characters that inhabit the world, and ~live the life~ in pocket-sized form.  If this was what the whole game was like, we wouldn't have been surprised, as it isn't a horrible overworld system, but lacks any sort of soul throughout.  The story itself is lame, the navigation around the world is boring, and the non-music mini-games are average at best, and that's giving it the benefit of the doubt.  Fortunately for all parties involved  especially the paying customer  these sections are gateways to a much stronger gameplay mechanic in the actual ~Jam~ moments of the game, which really shine in multiplayer.   Taking up the DS touch screen, players learn guitar, bass, and drum sections for Hannah's performances, and the skill translates over to multiplayer beautifully.  The general design is obviously ripped directly from the likes of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, but it really doesn't matter, as licensed games have been trying to take inspiration from the best for years. This one actually succeeds, and we'll give major props to that.  Music Jam lets you strum chords, change progressions with the d-pad, pluck individual strings (something that even Jam Sessions for DS, a virtual guitar simulator, doesn't do), and work the whammy bar.  The same general control goes for bass, with touch-based drumming handled as you'd expect, tapping different parts of a set with the stylus to lay down beats.     And now for a totally sweet trailer.  Ah yeah!     The general single player music mode is fun, having on-screen d-pad and touch icons scroll down the neck of the guitar (from top screen to bottom) and then line up along the strings, having players pick or strum at the perfect time, but where the game really excels is in the multiplayer modes, which allow you to not only play the small handful of licensed Hannah Montana music, but actually create your own music and jam as a band wirelessly.  The game uses some great technology to keep all players on the same page as well, with metronomes available to keep the beat, and a chord system that keeps the guitar and bass in the same key (basically an anti-ear bleed technology).  You can either free play with up to four players wirelessly, or actually lay down tracks and create your own music on your own or live in wireless connectivity mode.  It's a great multiplayer experience (and lets face it, you'll find more people playing Music Jam out in public than any other game), and it's obvious there's serious passion behind making not only a profitable Hannah Montana game  easy as that is right now  but also a quality product.   On the audio/visual side of things, Hannah Montana is a bit of a mix, as the 3D graphics are nothing to write home about, but the general 2D design of the actual music game is crisp and intuitive.  The music sounds great coming out of DS speakers, headphones, or amp (yes, we've played it with an amp), but with only a few licensed Hannah Montana tracks available it's going to come down to creating your own tunes, which is a bit more mature of a design than most starting gamers might be ready for.  Were amazed Hannah Montana: Music Jam is as good as it is.  The whole product is far from perfect overall, as about 50% of the package is still the average crappy overworld exploration, Hannah customization through shopping and endless wardrobe editing, and bafflingly boring mini-game experiences, but the game takes a drastic turn when moving towards the actual music elements, and thats where it shines.  Players can create their own tunes, link up with friends and jam on the fly or record music, and basically use Music Jam as a non-licensed Rock Band/Guitar Hero clone that just so happens to have a pink interface.  The multiplayer alone wont save the whole product, and in the end its still resting in the decent/good range, but its obvious the team over at Gorilla Games wanted to make a cool music game, and found a way to work it into an otherwise annoying licensed product.  Well keep on begging Disney Interactive Media to drop the license, lose the crappy single player mode, and make an entertaining portable Rock Band clone next time around  the team obviously knows what its doing  but for the time being well go get a few tattoos, pierce our ears, wear black leather, take up smoking, and give people evil looks as we rock out with Hannah Montana on DS.  It can be fun, but we just dont want anyone to know were playing it.", "date": "Nov 7, 2007"}
