{"name": "Chicken Run", "name_review": "Chicken Run", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/11/chicken-run-5", "text": "A hit animated movie usually gets licensed out to other properties in its lifespan, and Chicken Run is no different. Dreamworks and Aardman Animation's brilliant stop-motion flick really had a lot to offer in terms of entertainment -- brilliant writing and outstanding animation made this film one of the best of the year. The move from movie to videogame isn't a huge stretch for Chicken Run, for it had a lot of elements that could comfortably move to the interactive gaming world -- and the portable rendition isn't a simple cash-in. Some thought actually went into the design of this title, which definitely bodes well for the game since any other developer could have gone the ~safe~ route with a generic platformer featuring head-hopping roosters.  Features More than 20 levels Password save Only for Game Boy Color Chicken Run isn't an action game -- it's a ~task~ game similar to Lemmings where you have to herd a flock of brainless chicken (as many as four at a time) from the coop to each level's exits. You control Ginger, the heroine bird of the flock, and the only hen with any smarts whatsoever. She's the driving force in getting the chickens to freedom, and the only way to get them from point A to B is to drop piles of seed in a trail to the exit. Problem is,  Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy have it out for these chickens, and the second they see you or the mindless chickens trying to escape, that's the end of the level. The overall design isn't complex, but the challenge is definitely there. Some levels are a little easier to complete than others, and the element of time also adds to the difficulty of completing each level.  The game takes place in two locations -- the chicken farm and the pie machine. The way the game breaks the levels down, you're leading the chickens through different locations of the farm and then through the machine. Once you get the chickens out of the pie machine, it's back to the chicken farm to rescue some more chicken in different, harder levels. Ginger must make sure the coast is clear for these chickens to make it to the exit, so you'll have to find the tools that'll shut down the power in the spotlights, block the view of the watchdog with a crate, and toss a monkey wrench into the works to make sure the machinery doesn't make mincemeat of the fowl when they wander too close.  But even though there are different locations, the tasks are only different in cosmetics -- on the farm, you can grab a spoon and dig tunnels on specific spots from one location to another. In the pie machine, you grab a wrench and open vent doors that lead to another part of the machine. On the farm, you have to avoid spotlights and the dog,  in the machine you have to avoid the watchful eye of the camera. There are 20 levels in all -- that may sound like a short game, but some levels may take you an hour to figure out. Losing really must be done to win -- it's a little of that ol' trial and error. Chicken Run is extremely slow-paced, which means it most likely won't fall into the ~fun~ category for many gamers. You're literally dependent on the speed of the chicken you need to save -- and in some cases the AI of these brainless birds causes some problems with completing levels. Sometimes they'll wander away from the pile of seed you left for them, and you'll have to chase after them to keep them following the line. And sometimes, an open hole is more attractive to them than the pile of seed, which means they'll wander off your trail and elsewhere in the level. Once you learn how these birds ~think~ you'll be able to get through some of the more challenging puzzles later in the game, but it's a clumsy learning process early on -- a simple training exercise would have done the game wonders.  I'm super glad that Blitz Games (Chicken Run's developer) didn't cop out with a generic platformer, since we get plenty of that on the Game Boy side of things already. The design the team developed is a unique one, but it's not necessarily a great one -- the game putters along slowly, so it doesn't have a very maniacal, energetic feel to it like Lemmings does. The movie is excellent. The game is just slightly above average.", "date": "Nov 11, 2000"}
