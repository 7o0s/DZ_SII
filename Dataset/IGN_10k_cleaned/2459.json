Sonic's Sega's baby, and it's just a little odd to see the blue guy happily run across the screen on the former competition's system. Oh, sure, he managed to find his way onto the now defunct NeoGeo Pocket Color over a year ago, but that didn't seem as odd then as his experiencing his Nintendo debut with Sonic Advance on the Game Boy Advance. But it's definitely a good feeling, because Sega went all out for Sonic's Nintendo premiere...Sonic Advance is a well-rounded package for the GBA, containing new elements wrapped around the classic Sonic gameplay. Features Four characters More than twelve levels Chao Garden Mini-games Link Cable support for four players (single/multiple cartridge support) Battery Save GameCube interface with Sonic Adventure 2: Battle Only for Game Boy Advance Sonic Advance is a completely original product that expands upon an existing design. This Game Boy Advance product takes themes and ideas established in the original Sonic the Hedgehog series on the Sega Genesis, all the while adding new elements brought up in his newer adventures on the Dreamcast. Sonic Advance is a strict side-scrolling platformer that moves through more than twelve different levels in six separate environments. The first couple of levels are pretty much laid-out so that Sonic can stretch his furry legs to see what he's made of, since there are tons of straight-aways, corkscrews, jumps, springs to push our hero into his hyper speed...it's what he's known for, and his blazing velocity is accurately represented on the Game Boy Advance screen with no blur whatsoever. Thank god for high refresh LCD screens. The task is a simple matter of getting to the end of the round unscathed. Take a hit, and any rings that Sonic's collected along the way explodes out of his grip...as long as he holds onto one ring, he'll survive any hit from an enemy.  Many, if not all, of the levels are set in same locations used in the classic Sonic the Hedgehog series. The levels themselves are completely original, but the areas themselves dictate all of the obstacles and challenges. Casino Paradise Zone, for example, is full of the familiar pinball machine mechanisms, sending our character bouncing around the world like, well, a pinball. In the Ice Mountain Zone, you'll need to find pockets of air to survive the underwater areas. There are new ideas as well, like the grind function -- find a downward sloping rail along the way and Sonic will be able to slide down it without any loss of speed. The Secret Base Zone puts the GBA's transparency capabilities to use early on in a clever spotlighting effect...luckily it doesn't last long since it's really hard to see beyond this effect on the GBA's screen.  Admittedly, 12 levels can only go so far, and it's definitely possible (and more likely probable) to blast through all of them with Sonic in just under two hours. Fortunately, that's only part of the game -- there are three other characters to use, and each of these characters have his or her own techniques for the same 12 levels. Tails can literally fly up high to reach ledges that you might not have seen with Sonic. Knuckles can climb up the sides of walls and float beyond chasms that would have sent Sonic to his doom. And Amy...she's more of a Mario style hero, since she doesn't have the same maniacal speed or attacks as the other three. She carries a massive hammer and can get through the levels in a more leisurely pace, so use her to do more exploring and less sonic booms.  Sonic Advance is also jam-packed with other goodies that increase the playtime and worth. The rings you earn can be converted into goodies used in the Tiny Chao Garden. See, you can care for these cute blue critters on your Game Boy Advance, feeding and petting them as if they're a pet...a ~virtual pet~ so to speak. The cool thing here is, if find yourself a GameCube with Sonic Adventure 2 Battle and a GameCube Game Boy Advance cable, you can send your little buddy to the system and onto the Chao Races. The mini-games in the Tiny Chao Garden are also deceptively fun, too...they're honestly not much more than a simple game of Memory and Rock/Paper/Scissors, but they're designed in such a way that you may find yourself playing them over and over and over...I know I did. The Tiny Chao Garden is what's sent to the Game Boy Advance from the GameCube if you don't have Sonic Advance, but believe me...you want the cartridge if you're planning on a Sonic Adventure 2 Battle purchase, since the cartridge actually saves your Chao's progress to the battery backed RAM.  And one more thing: the link play in Sonic Advance is outstanding. If you only have one cartridge you can play a game of ~Get the most rings~ on a single map against three other people...and it's worth it right there. But if everyone's got a cartridge, then you and your buddies can leap right into any unlocked level in other modes of play: Race, a self-explained mode where it's first to the end of the round; and Chao Hunt, a cool little game of tag where everyone tries to stake a claim on a lost little blue creature.  To be honest, I've more been a fan of Sonic the character more than Sonic the videogames...even from the beginning, on the Sega Genesis, the huge turn-off for me was simply the fact that the level designers focused more on super huge levels to get the character up to speed...which unfortunately left me wondering what I'm passing by. The whole feeling of exploration was thrown out the window because of the heavy focus on speed.  And that's why I loved the NeoGeo Pocket Color's Sonic Pocket Adventure...the designers included little hidden tokens to collect throughout the game levels, encouraging the exploration element in its game design. Now, the GBA's Sonic Advance doesn't have these little hidden tokens to collect, but it makes up for it by hiding the super secret bonus world somewhere deep in each level...which means, if you simply blast through the game, you'll never gain access to the special worlds, and you'll never find the Chaos Emeralds, and you'll never finish the game with the best ending. Exploration is a good thing, people, and it's what makes Sonic better on the Game Boy Advance than on the Genesis. Add to this the ability to play as four distinctly different characters, and you've got yourself a game that you can play over and over well after you've completed all the levels the first time.The game, admittedly, does have some of the same Sonic-isms that drive me nuts...like an inviting stretch of roadway that begs to have your character blaze across it at top speed, only to have a spike strip jab you in the feet somewhere in the middle. It's an extremely cheap tactic, and it still bugs the heck out of me when it happens...especially since you're living in fear every time your character hits his maximum velocity.Still, Sega's GBA development team pulled out a wonderful handheld title...it covers every possible base on system: it's graphically excellent, it sounds great, it puts the link cable features to outstanding use, and its GameCube connectivity opens up potential never before available.", "date": "Feb 5, 2002"}
