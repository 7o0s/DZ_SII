The new baseball title features five single player modes including an expansive 162 game season mode, wireless two-player gaming, and the complete roster of MLB players with current stats.   Developer Hexacto Games has attempted to include multiple game modes and extras to make a well-rounded portable baseball experience, but despite of all the bells and whistles MLB Slam! suffers from dull and unintuitive gameplay that will fail to please all but the most desperate of N-Gage sports fanatics.  Features Five single player modes Two-player wireless multiplayer Full roster of MLB players Current player stats Dream Team creation mode   Whether you pick Quick Match, Spring Training, Full Season, Post Season, or Homerun Derby, the only thing that really changes are the teams and the number of games. You are still left with a very stripped-down pitch and hit game where the outfield and base running are left almost entirely under the control of the computer.   While there are a handful of pitching styles intended to keep your opponent guessing, the computer hits or misses at random, making the task of choosing a slider, curveball, or fastball unnecessary. We were able to win entire games without ever changing the speed or style of our pitch. Needless to say this results in an extremely tedious time at the pitcher's mound. Once the computer makes a hit the player's role in the game diminishes even further, and your closest outfielder automatically runs after and often catches the ball for you. All that's left up to the player is to choose which base to throw to.  Things get a little more interesting at the batting plate. Connecting with the ball is a simple matter of lining up a curser with the pitch. By pressing the 8 button you can put more power behind your swing, but as a result your swing curser becomes smaller and more difficult to line up with the ball. Paying attention to the batter's stats comes in handy, as attempting power hits with lesser skilled players can be disastrous. Relying on your reflexes and staying aware of your batter's abilities are the most engaging aspects of MLB Slam! Unfortunately the fun stops there and the computer takes control of the base running.  Full Season mode will take you through the entirety of a MLB season, including inter-league and post season games. You can play a season with your favorite MLB teams, or with your own handpicked roster in Dream Team mode. Dream Team is a fairly simple recruit-and-trade mode that makes season games a little more interesting by putting money and player value on the line.  While the N-Gage is supposed to represent a technological leap in graphics for portables, MLB Slam! is a stumble backwards. Extremely simplified character models, static, flat looking stadium environments, and choppy animations are reminiscent of the ancient days of 8-bit gaming. Camera perspectives are limited to two basic views--behind the batter and a top-down view of the field. The top-down perspective also has a major flaw; there are no icons to indicate player positions when they escape the view of the camera. Multiple times we found ourselves starring at a solitary ball, not knowing where the off-screen players where or which direction to press to run and retrieve it, turning a simple error into a helpless situation.  Umpire calls, bat cracks and crowd cheers make up most of the audio effects in MLB Slam! There is no music, commentators, or classic baseball organ tunes blaring across the stadium (probably for the better). Overall sound design conforms with the rest of the game in being barely average, and won't be missed if you play without it.The first baseball title on the N-Gage fails to take advantage of the system's capabilities and falls behind similar Game Boy Advance titles in almost every aspect. The expansive season mode, Dream Team option and full players stats are nice additions but they cannot make up for the tedious gameplay.", "date": "Dec 10, 2003"}
