But it is strange that it's this good. Don't get me wrong, it's not like Codemasters makes bad games. In fact, just the opposite. Like for instance, Colin McRae Rally is an awesome game that I played for weeks on end. But 1998's Toca (published by 3DO) was a slight disappointment, and this game is the American version of Toca Touring Car 2. What Codemasters did was work on the little things, lots of little things, and while the game doesn't quite gel, it's still a very impressive title.   Gameplay Stock car racing? Well, if that's what they want to call it, fine. But Jarrett and LaBonte StockCar Racing is really a touring car game in stock car clothing. Taken from Codemasters' highly acclaimed World Touring Car series, Jarrett and LaBonte Stock Car Racing brings gamers a highly refined, skill-based near-simulation of well a strange hybrid of stock car and touring car racing.    Jarrett and LaBonte offers gamers a wide range of racing challenges, plus some of the best car physics and physical damage you've seen in a racing game. So, before I list the modes, let's get to the heart of the game first. What makes Jarrett and LaBonte so fun is the amazing way cars take damage. If you're not careful, you can literally destroy the car in the first 30 seconds of the game. Why? Because of two things: first, the opponent AI is clever and mean and likes to push you off the road. Opponents race up behind your car and will tip your rear end, or push you into the green, instantly throwing you off course, or even worse, into a wild tail spin. Of course, as you learn the ins and outs of driving this game, you too will learn how to perform the same tricks, nudging them into the disastrous sidelines of green death. But, honestly, I am surprised at how good the AI is. It took me a while to get past the relatively medium learning curve, but it took me even longer to actually take first place in any race. Thank God for the Vancouver course!   I mentioned two reasons why this game is so amazing. The second technical reason that it's so cool is because of the planned randomness, the realistic situations that could totally ruin your perfect run. For instance, the first thing you must overcome is to simply leave the pack behind, a seemingly easy thing to do, but easier said than done.  At the beginning of every race, you must surpass 13 other cars at the starting line. And also because you can find yourself crushed in massive 14 car pileups. In one case, my car was crushed by a pack of cars making the first of many sharp turns. There may have been one other possibility to avoid it, but I didn't see it. In another course, I was performing extremely well in the Vancouver course, and before I could make out what was happening, a car had slammed into an island and I subsequently T-boned it hardcore.   I'm so far ahead of myself. Ughh...OK, Let's start with the game modes. Championship mode, which is really the heart of the game, enables you work your way up through dozens of courses as either Jarrett or LaBonte via ladder races (four to six race challenges) in which you need to place in the top three or accumulate enough points to continue racing. Codemasters has done a great job of re-creating 23 real courses from all over Europe, America, Australia, and more. Courses include Laguna Seca, Road America, Monza, Silverstone, Suzuka and Surfers Paradise, plus many more. Players vie on all sorts of courses in all sorts of weather conditions. By passing each challenge, you earn as many as four bonus cars, and you'll get offers from different teams depending on your performance, too.   Players also get the chance to race in Free Race (an open race in which you can set all sorts of factors, including number of players, weather, AI, number of enemies, courses, etc.), Time Trial (you against the clock, and in subsequent races, s ghost car), Quick Race (a simple random race just for fun).   The list of vehicles is quite impressive, too. It's no GT 2, but these guys did some serious work. Cars to choose from include Audi TT, Dodge Viper, BMW, Alfa Romeo, and Chrysler, Volvo S40, Honda Accord, Opel, Ford Taurus, Mustang GT, Mitsubishi FTO and the Mitsubishi GTO, Peugeot 306 GT-i, Plymouth Prowler, Toyota Celica GT-four,  Lotus 340R, AC Superblower, Mazda RX-7, AC Aceca, TVR Cerbear Speed 12, Volvo S40, Peugeot 405, Chrysler 340, Bentley and the Hunaudieras.   It's also important to customize cars prior to racing. Luckily for newbies, Codemaster does a good job explaining what does what and why. For instance, it's not as simulation-intensive a game as TOCA was, but changing the settings on your suspension, transmission, and downforce modifications still makes a big difference when it comes to dealing with different tracks. While fast tracks demand a different setting than slower, twisty tracks, getting into four-wheel drive is a major advantage in curvy courses, but faster rear-drive cars dominate on the straight sections. Users will need to play around with this aspect of the game over a period of hours to get everything just right.   Graphics In the fifth year of the PlayStation's amazingly long career, Jarrett and LaBonte shows some of the best aspects of the system, and some of the worst, too. At the top of the positive list we find that the cars are wonderfully detailed, and that they are totally interactive -- i.e. they can be totally deformed. Hood fly off in front of your window, bumpers smash off, glass is shattered, and fenders and side panels get smashed. The car deformation in this game makes EA's Need for Speed games (NFS High Stakes and NFS Porsche Unleashed) deformation look like child's play.   What's more, if your fender doesn't come all of the way off, it hangs from your car and skid around until it finally comes off, sort of like a scab or a hangnail. That in itself isn't a big deal, but it creates sparks that shoot about for as long as the fender is hanging there. Again, not a big deal, but it's cool looking, and realistic, and rarely if ever done. Plus, just like in the first Toca, you get the chance to see the driver steering and shifting gears in the cockpit. These guys did a great job with this perspective, it's really quite impressive. In the end, it's the graphic details that count and Jarrett and LaBonte has them in spades.   On the other hand, the courses are rather plainly detailed, with mostly grassy side sections, some buildings, and stands for fans. Certainly, the game looks better than the almost barren first TOCA, but once again it looks like classic Codemasters -- where the coders focus on great gameplay, physics and AI, and play the graphics very conservatively. I can live with that.   Sound I'll make this simple, if you like Offspring, Lit, Moby, Methods of Mayhem, Radiator, then you will enjoy most of the music in this game. Luckily, players won't hear the same song looped over and over in each of the longer races. You'll hear different songs before they replay. That's a good thing, because it spares just about anybody who plays the game long enough to get it, and provides variety. On the other hand, I personally think that the Offspring sucks; if I had to listen to that kind of music I prefer Green Day or better yet Nirvana or ~old folks~ Soundgarden, but those guys aren't ~cool~ right now.   As for the car sound effects, they're pretty middle of the road. You'll hear the cars grinding and the gears changing and the car spatting when downshifting, and the crowd roaring. It's just not a top priority for the Codemasters guys, it seems. Nothing is stunning, but it doesn't suck either. Games like Driver, GT, R4 have much better sound effects. Oh well. Having played a lot of racing games (dozens over the last 20-plus years), I find that Jarrett and Labonte is an odd one. Perhaps it's because I haven't been spoon-fed touring car games or broadcasts all my life, but maybe it's because this game truly is a weird concoction of elements that don't quite gel. It's got the right license for the US, it's packed with great physics, superb realtime car deformation, and perhaps some of the toughest opponent AI I've seen in the last two years of racer on PS2, but I simply haven't fallen in love with it. It's sort of like a woman I know is pretty, that other men drool over, but she simply doesn't pique my interest. The learning curve isn't tough, but you'll have to love this game to really enjoy it. It has all the elements to make it a great game, but I simply didn't fall in love with it. Perhaps you will, it's certainly a good game.", "date": "Oct 18, 2000"}
