{"name": "Centipede", "name_review": "Centipede", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/08/26/centipede-4", "text": "Sometimes companies create Game Boy versions of classic arcade titles because they appreciated the design of these titles when they were originally released, and feel they've passed the test of time and still hold up in today's market. Others do it for the money. Centipede on the Game Boy Color is an example of the latter, unfortunately -- it's a damn shame a classic game had to turn out this bad on the portable system. Features Based on the original arcade game Two player alternate modes Link cable support for two players cooperative For Game Boy or Game Boy Color  Centipede was designed as a game inspired by Space Invaders. The old Atari arcade was simplistic but addictive -- shoot a constantly descending group of insects before they crash into your pod. The field is filled with mushrooms that can be shot, and as each segment of the centipede is destroyed, another mushroom shows up in its place. Simple yet fun to play.  The Game Boy version, on the otherhand --  let's look at the facts: Majesco picked up Centipede, an existing Game Boy game that was released by Accolade more than three years ago, and it wasn't very good to begin with. Then, the company re-released the game with color enhancements, and that's it.  Why is the game not good? Well, first of all, it's just not an accurate representation of the original arcade game. It sort of looks like it, but doesn't sound like it -- but worst of all it just doesn't move at the speed it should. When the segmented centipede comes careening down the screen, he does it in jerky motions. And the control, originally a trackball, has been mapped to the d-pad insensitively -- you move either in a slow, or faster pace as you hold down on the direction. Either way you cut it there's no speed fast enough to accurately represent the hectic pace of the arcade game. There have been much, much better versions of Centipede on home systems than the one on the Game Boy Color.  Problem is, the person responsible for giving it color didn't bother to look at the way the game actually looks in the arcade. ~Hey, let's just give an assortment of colors to the mushrooms!~ Wrong. Mushrooms are one single color for a reason: so you can tell the regular mushrooms from the poisonous ones.  On the plus side, the game does feature a rather unique two player cooperative mode for those with two systems and a link-cable, but the programmer should have focused his attention on making Centipede look and play like Centipede before worrying about extras. It's just a shame to think what Centipede could have been on the Game Boy -- instead, we just get a rehash of a black-and-white with poor color implementation. Maybe Hasbro can re-claim the license and do Centipede right.", "date": "Aug 26, 1999"}
