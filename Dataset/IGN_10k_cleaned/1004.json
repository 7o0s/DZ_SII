So I'll pass on the hook and just say this: Flying Heroes is one of the best games I've played this year. Yes, dear readers, it rocks. It rocks hard in the morning when I play a round while still rubbing the sawdust out of my eyes, and it rocks gently in the evening when sleep is trying to wash over me like the cool, forgetful waters of Lethe. Best of all, it rocks at a bargain price. You should be able to find it for about $20, which is the value price that TalonSoft is pushing it at.   Flying Heroes is the game Drakan should have been. Forget all the stupid adventure game stuff in Drakan. We just wanted to fly and fight, and that's what Flying Heroes gives us in spades  well, to be precise, gives us on the backs of dragons, great winged birds, ensorcelled giant teapots, and powerful zeppelins. Flying Heroes is a game of fantastic flying beasts, enchanted objects, and mechanical constructs all battling one another in fierce league play. It's a game that's a delightful cross between a shooter like Quake and any space sim you fancy, all the while with a charm and style all its own.   The single-player game, called ~career mode,~ consists of a series of league matches. The fantasy world of Hesperia is one where warfare has been replaced by league sports. The sport is pretty simple. It's a free-for-all deathmatch with points be awarded based on the rank of the participants at the end of the match. At the end of the season, the player with the most points graduates to the next league. There are three leagues, bronze, silver, and gold. Each league gets progressively harder.   In an interesting twist, each mount starts with all the available weapons, but the player has to find ammo power-ups to be able to use all but the default weapon. Mana also plays a part, with each player being able to cast spells or perform special abilities that require mana, like a turn-back move that quickly reverses direction.    There are four factions, or teams, in the world. At the start, only two are available to the player: the flying lizards and the Magion. (You need to win the game to unlock the other two factions for play.) The other teams are the Sky Knights and the Hammercrafts. A large part of the game's appeal are the real differences in the teams. It's almost like a class-based system like you get in a game such as Tribes, although the factions in Flying Heroes are balanced towards combat and not specific tasks.   The flying lizards are your basic dragons. They handle a bit like a helicopter and have the ability to hover and fly backwards. They're pretty tough and get some good poison weapons. The Magion are mages and they enchant objects and use them as their mounts. If you play as the light and nimble Magion, you may start off with a flying carpet for example, and progress to other objects such as a giant teapot and finally a galleon. Although you flit around quickly and the Magion have better spell casting abilities than the other factions, they are lightly armored. The Sky Knights ride the backs of giant birds. These fly somewhat like jets and have powerful, rapid attacks but are also lightly armored. Finally, the Hammercraft are heavily armored and have powerful cannons with the ability to ~free look~ and aim everywhere except above (all the other factions can only aim straight ahead). The Hammercraft hover and move slowly in the air, however, and are vulnerable to attacks from above.   As you progress through league play, you get money for the frags you rack up. Also, between each league match you can fly an optional mission for cash. These optional missions can be games of ~tag~ (avoid being ~it~ and you'll win), combat missions against demons guarding treasure, and more. You can then use the cash to upgrade your weapons, which will make them dramatically more powerful, or even purchase a new and better mount. This ability to upgrade, which is essential to success, makes for a very engaging game. You'll find that you'll look forward to getting that better weapon or larger mount. It really helps drive the game forward.   You can also fly individual missions outside the campaign game. For these you can pick your opponents and select their mounts and weapons, so you can handicap the match if you feel like it.   Flying Heroes uses the PTERO graphics engine. It's not as strong graphically as the latest generation of 3D shooters and uses fog effects more than I'd like, but the textures in the game are very well done. The maps are excellent, ranging from underground caverns, arctic regions where you can fly above or below the ice, desert ruins, and floating cities in the air. The art in Flying Heroes could grace the cover of any one of a number of science fiction or fantasy novels and look right at home.   Despite its strengths, Flying Heroes does have a few shortcomings. There are only a dozen or so maps. The career mode matches could have used a little more variety than straight deathmatches. The multiplayer is a bit anemic. HEAT.net is supposed to provide a matching service, but it doesn't work right yet, so players are left to play by entering the host's IP address manually. Also, there is no bot support for multiplayer, which is a bit odd since the bots play well in career mode. Voice acting is comically poor. And the weapon sounds are just plain wimpy.   Flying Heroes is good enough and fresh enough to overcome these issues, though. It's a game that I've kept coming back to just to play for fun. You will have to stick with it a bit if you try it, though. It grows on you after a few hours of play, unlike a game like Unreal Tournament which great from the first moment you play it. Flying Heroes is a bit more complex and a bit slower to reveal its strengths, but they're there.   -- Mark Asher", "date": "Jun 10, 2000"}
