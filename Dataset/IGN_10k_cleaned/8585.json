SEGA's odd couple of funky-fresh, hip-hop aliens came from the Genesis, and in the duo's first outing on the 16-bit SEGA system they found themselves stranded on Earth, surrounded by psychedelic scenery and the general insanity of humanity's homeworld. After successfully re-assembling their crashed starship, though, it looked like the hyperactive action would get toned down to a more subtle, mellow jazz as the pair blasted off while the credits rolled. Not the case. A crafty batch of tourism-mad humans stowed away on ToeJam and Earl's interstellar cruiser and are now infesting their own home planet, Funkotron. Lame to the max.   So ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron is a clean-up quest, as the titular stars seek to recapture the invading earthlings, purify their alien planet and get all the natural funk back to normal. By side-scrolling. In a complete and total shift from the birds-eye perspective of play offered in the original TJ&E, this sequel instead opts for a more traditional, side-viewed, action/platforming design. Like Nintendo's choice to shift gears when moving from The Legend of Zelda to Zelda II (which also debuted today), the change in ToeJam and Earl's fundamentals wasn't taken too well by established fans, back in 1993.        What's here, though, isn't bad. Different, yes, but not bad. The focus this time is on bottling  exploring each vibrant environment, seeking out the hiding humans, and then stuffing them into little glass bottles. So captured, the invading earthlings can be deposited into an Earth-bound rocket at the end of each level. Miss any, and you'll have to backtrack to find the leftovers.   The platforming play is fair. A little loose in control, but all the while fluidly animated and fun  ToeJam and Earl both look much better than ever before, in fact, as their large, expressive characters sprites here are a massive improvement over the shrimpy, simple avatars of the original. The sonic stylings of the soundtrack also impress, though those aren't as much improved  TJ&E1 already sounded great, so there wasn't as much room for advancement in the audio.   The core component, of course, is the game's two-player cooperative play. That was the calling card for ToeJam and Earl's first outing, and remains a focus here. You don't find a lot of 16-bit era games that allowed for two players to simultaneously adventure together, and cramming screaming humans into small glass pickle jars is a more satisfying experience with a friend by your side.      Rounding out the adventure is a good fair number of extras that add a lot of depth  collectible items like more powerful jars, radar scans and vacuums help to expedite the success of the core mission, while a few tangential mini-games give you a break from the pursuit. ToeJam and Earl can find themselves involved in impromptu jam sessions with their alien friends, where button taps are used to break it down streetwise next to a pumping boombox. Or they might stumble upon a hidden entrance to the Hyper Funk Zone, a wacky alternate world rendered in scribbled crayon that plays more like a light take on Sonic the Hedgehog.Though not as memorable as their debut adventure, ToeJam and Earl's Panic on Funkotron is a suitably solid sequel. Gamers that gave TJ&E1 a try and enjoyed it would likely also have fun with this adventure, also priced at 800 Wii Points  even though the style of play is totally different. Give it a shot if you're tired of rescuing helpless humans in games, and would rather spend some time hunting them as enemies instead.", "date": "Jun 4, 2007"}
