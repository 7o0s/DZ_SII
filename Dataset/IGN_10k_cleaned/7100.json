Super Puzzle Fighter II may not look entirely different from such second-tier puzzlers as Columns, but the game offers some non-traditional mechanics that sets it apart from basic color-matching titles.   Capcom fans will surely enjoy the presence of some popular brawlers from the Street Fighter and Nightstalker franchises, such as Ryu and Chun Li. At the beginning of a game, players choose which fighter will represent them in the match -- but this is not just a cosmetic choice. Each fighter has specific gem-dumping patterns that affect the arrival of excess jewels.   Once in the game, players must direct a series of falling gems to the bottom of their wells. Unlike other jewel-based puzzlers, you don't clear the screen by just lining up the same colors. Instead, like-colored gems need to be grouped together to form mega-gems. Then, you have to look for circular symbols of the same color to drop into the well. Place the circle next to a same-colored group of gems, and it clears the jewels from the well. If you can clear out mega-gems, you'll earn big points and prep a barrage of ~garbage~ gems for your opponent.   Super Puzzle Fighter II is Capcom's first big stab at network play. The game was developed by accomplished mobile maker Mikoishi, the firm responsible for THQ Wireless' hit Star Wars Battlefront Mobile. Mikoishi has created a network-friendly play structure for Super Puzzle Fighter II that works quite well for mobile. The game is broken up into three rounds. During each round, you try to do the best you can to earn points and save up garbage. Between rounds, the game connects to the network and lines up performances, ~sending~ the results of your moves to the other player. Then, when the next round starts, your performance in the previous round is put into play. If you managed to wipe out some mega-gems, the other player will enjoy a fat drop of garbage of their screen sometime during play -- likely right before they get ready to make a solid play. Your score in each round is tabulated at the end of the game, points are deducted for every time you filled your well and KO'd, and then a winner is declared through a nice bit of animation. This is a pretty clever solution for keeping the action moving, but easily digestible for a mobile game session that won't consume too much airtime.   Setting up matches is easy, thanks to a simple lobby where you can issue challenges and check out other player's profiles. (This lets you gather pre-game intel so you don't waste airtime going up against a ridiculously good player when you're just starting out.) You can send messages to other players, too, which does foster some semblance of a community atmosphere.   While playing the game, I felt like I understood why Super Puzzle Fighter II never achieved the fame of other genre luminaries. There is an element of random-ness to the game. You know how you can set up combos in Tetris? That kind of strategy never seemed to work in Super Puzzle Fighter II. I could try and set up mega-gems, but I was always at the whim of the circle symbols. For example, I set up a massive green gem along the bottom of the screen, and then proceeded to only get blue and red circles. By the time the green circle showed up, the green gems were buried with no hope of getting to them before the 90 second round length was up. I don't want to be spoon fed wins by any stretch, but situations like this were the norm, not the exception. What is the thrill of repeatedly setting up big combos and then never getting to put them into play?  I wish I liked the actual game of Super Puzzle Fighter II more, because Mikoishi's method of dividing a competitive puzzler up into rounds is incredibly smart design. By limiting rounds to only 90 seconds, there is no risk of consuming all of your airtime with epic gem-for-gem games. Finding a game was easy, too, even if there weren't many competitors in the lobby this early in release. (I suspect that will change.) The game has a clean interface, good graphics, and a pleasant little jingle that accompanies the game play. Fans of Super Puzzle Fighter II will likely have a great time with this competitive mobile edition, but the mechanics of the game just never totally won me over like Zuma or Bejeweled.", "date": "Aug 1, 2006"}
