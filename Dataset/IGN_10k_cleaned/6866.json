In development for a good two years, the Japanese design team at KCEK in Kobe, Japan, had to overcome a lot of hurdles to get this game done. The original concept for Castlevania 64 called for complex intertwining game paths with four playable characters, but after evaluating an early version of the game shown at E3, Konami decided it would be best to simplify. The sad news is that two characters, Cornell and Kola, had to be cut. The good news is that almost everything else remained intact, making the N64 Castlevania a great first step into the third dimension. It's not as good as Symphony of the Night, but it's certainly one of the top third person action games on the N64.StoryIt's the end of the 19th century. Wallachia, Transylvania, where the dark legend of Dracula was born, is once again subject to unexplained phenomena. St. Elmo's Fires are casting their phosphorous glow on the crooked elm trees of the dark landscape. The damned souls of the people of Transylvania (what is up with these folks?) have once more awoken an evil that was banished 100 years ago. Castlevania, Dracula's seat of power, has started to emerge from the shadows and with it, the ultimate evil, the Lord of Darkness: Dracula. A bat, a wolf, a nebulous mist... ever changing... growing strong in the darkness, hating the light, cursing the gods... sucking the blood of maidens, enjoying eternal life With clouds of darkness gathering to smother all hope, monsters run rampant through the countryside terrorizing all except the ones that pledge their soul to the undead lord. Luckily, two valiant heroes stand in his way, guided by you, of course.GameplayAt the beginning of the game, a leather-bound Necronomicon opens on screen, revealing the two playable characters: Reinhardt Schneider, the most recent son in the Belmont clan, and Carrie Fernandez, a psychic magic user from an equally important family. As the simple moniker ~Castlevania~ (no number, not ~64~) suggests, Konami sees this game as a first installment in a new series of Castlevania games -- which explains the (in our opinion) strange name change of the main character.Depending on which character you choose, the game's quest will be slightly different. For example, playing as Schneider, you will never see the Towers of Sorcery or Science. To entice gamers to play through the game with both Schneider and Carrie, there are also two separate endings for each character.Gameplay and structure are very reminiscent of the original 2D games. Although some of the stages contain a few ~RPG~ or adventure elements, the level progression is completely linear. If you've played Castlevania before, you know the drill: platform jumping, candle whipping, undead killing, and so on. The game also includes a simple item system and the ability to buy power-ups from a ~demon merchant~ at key points in the levels.Controls are a bit loose at first, but you'll get used to the floaty feeling after a while. One area in which Konami should have tightened them or at least given more ~camera support~, is when climbing or descending platforms. The often fixed 3D perspective makes it really hard to judge the distance and location of the platforms, quite often leading to accidental deaths. Speaking of which, the camera is entirely too jumpy. Konami tried to implement some changes to the camera system late in the development process (probably after seeing Zelda), but there are still quite a few moments where the camera just won't do what you want. The late additions, namely a ~lock-on camera~ during boss battles and the ability to face your enemy by tapping R, are a step into the right direction, though.Puzzles are mostly straightforward and include finding switches or aligning statues in a predetermined way. Jumping and slashing enemies with the whip is easily executed (a red target cross shows which enemy you are currently aiming at), but players can also use a secondary weapon, or throw projectile weapons with the C Buttons. So if you're too close to a skeleton to effectively use your whip, simply stab at the undead warriors with your sword. Some hits will leave the skeletons headless or cut in half at the hip. But even when in pieces, the skeletons won't give up and crawl after you. A nice touch.The tertiary weapons, or projectile weapons, are limited in number. You have to keep a steady supply of red jewels to use them and you can only hold one weapon type at the time. They are -- thankfully -- taken from the old Castlevania games, although a little more variety would have been nice: Dagger: A fast attack, doesn't cause very much damage. Axe: An arched flight path helps you hit monsters hiding behind objects. Also good against bone dragons. Holy Water: Throw a vial at the ground to produce a burning carpet of blue flames. Good against dumb opponents who run at you. Cross: The cross-shaped boomerang takes out multiple targets at once.Whether you're inside buildings or outside, the time of day will constantly change -- much like in Zelda 64. In addition to the visual clues (such as the sky getting darker), there is also a small time display in the upper left corner of the screen. Apart from making for an atmospheric effect, the time of day in the game also affects your enemies' powers. During the day, vampires are weaker and must hide in the shadows, whereas they become vicious and dangerous at night. The time changes also play a role in solving certain puzzles, although this feature seems a bit underdeveloped. Certain doors only open at night, or you won't meet a character unless you're in the right spot at the right time. There are also a few ~12 midnight~ spots that let you stock up on items if your timing is good.There are roughly 14 different stages, some only playable by Schneider, some only playable by Carrie. Castlevania fans will be thrilled to hear that the clock tower with its spinning gears and cogs has made it into the game (albeit without the classic music), but some of the game's best moments are to be found elsewhere. The idea to start off the game with a boss (do yourself a favor and turn up the volume when you start playing) is excellent, the small, yet fun RPG elements in the Villa add to the adventure feel, and Dracula's final form will have you go ~ooooops... I'm screwed.~ Our favorite stage, however, is the Castle Center. Here, you're asked to transport explosives from one area to another to blow up a wall. The catch: You can't jump or get hit while you're carrying them, otherwise... Booooom! What a cool idea!The game is also fairly challenging for the most part (especially on the hidden ~Hard~ difficulty setting), but like Metal Gear Solid, it could be a lot longer. If you know what you're doing, you can race through the game in only a few hours. Good thing you still have the second character to play...We beat the game with both characters and have to say that we loved playing it (except for that #&@%! Tower of Sorcery and the hedge maze), but being the nitpickers we are, we have a couple of quibbles.1. First of all, the storyline. Konami could have made the story more interesting by trying to make sense of the mess it's created. A chainsaw and WWII-style motorbikes in the 19th century? We're sure Dracula has been doing some experiments with time, but they don't really come across. A little bit more work tying Castlevania in with the rest of the series would have been nice, too2. Whip. The fact that Carrie's attack homes in on enemies and Schneider's whip only works with nearby enemies makes for varied gameplay, but what ever happened to the alternate uses of the whip? We sorely missed being able to swing with the whip or using it as a shield against projectile attacks. Weird.3. Saving. This type of game suggests EEPROM saving. Instead we have to use Controller Paks. Thankfully, there are quite a few save points (in the form of white jewels) and the game only takes up a few pages on your Controller Pak.4. Vampires. If you get bitten, you turn into a vampire. Originally, Konami was going to pursue this route and make being a vampire more than just a punishment (you can't use your primary attack or eat food). Heck, shouldn't you be invisible when looking into a mirror?Overall, we walked away from Castlevania relieved that Konami didn't screw up its more than 10-year-old gaming series. Whether the move to full 3D was smart, or not, Castlevania is fun to play -- and that's what counts.GraphicsFirst the bad stuff. Castlevania is brought to you in vaseline-o-vision. It seems that Konami still hasn't gotten used to texture filtering and anti-aliasing, as many of the game's levels look much too muddy and blurry. There is also a fair amount of fog in many of the areas to keep the game running smoothly and you will notice old-fashioned slowdown when more than two enemies are on screen -- but at least the framerates are constant. The game's biggest problem is in the texture department. Although many of the wall textures look great from far away, Konami still hasn't figured out to make full use of the console's different texture modes. Ground textures are terribly low-res and stretched over huge polygons, which makes the landscapes look worse than they really are. While some rooms and character models look great, there are also a few overly simplistic ones. The Harryhausen skeletons are cool, but what was Konami thinking when designing the Villa vampire?On the positive side, each of the almost 15 game areas looks different from the other and Konami managed to create a very cinematic game. The forest level, for example, starts on a rainy night with thunder and lightning accompanying your quest. We won't give away what happens, but be sure to turn up the volume for a little surprise early on. The castle and villa levels look fantastic, with detailed rooms and corridors, moving cogs and plenty of enemies. Asides from skeletons, bone dragons and spider women, the game also features gigantic bosses, such as a horned Behemoth, a three-headed cerberus, an oversized skeleton, and even Death himself. The motion models for the creatures are great and there are even some subtle lighting effects on the characters.Graphically, Castlevania is an above average looking game with some nasty textures (Schneider's boots come to mind). Sadly, the game does not support the 4MB RAM Expansion.SoundKonami still has some of the best composers and sound designers in the industry. From the rain to the screeching sounds of gates and elevators, the sound effects in this game are outstanding. Music is equally fantastic and just beckons for a nice stereo system with a subwoofer. While there are at least four pieces that recall the aural greatness of the old Castlevania games, the compositions are much less complex and often more on the ambient side. Some of the graphically more complex areas have no music at all -- it's supposed to keep the game running more smoothly, but it actually helps build up the atmosphere. The intro music is vintage Konami. We were hoping for a few classic melodies from the old games, but the game is certainly one of the best-sounding N64 titles out there.I was really worried about Castlevania going 3D for a while, but I'm happy to report that this game is much better than expected. After you get over the initial frustration of making spatial judgments (damn platforms!), Castlevania quickly grows on you and will have you play non-stop till you reach the end. While I liked Schneider better (it's the whip. No, really), Carrie's got some neat levels of her own. It's definitely worth playing both characters. Graphics range from ~bleech~ to excellent, and there are quite a few original touches that make this game stand on its own feet. Castlevania's baby steps into the third dimension have been successful ones, but after seeing how well Goemon 2 plays in its pseudo-3D perspective, I really hope that we will see another 2D Castlevania with 3D backgrounds soon.PS: Don't bother with the EASY difficulty. It only lets you play a few levels.", "date": "Jan 28, 1999"}
