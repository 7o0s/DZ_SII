After becoming a sleeper phenomenon with a rabid following in its NES incarnation, you'd think somebody would have been smart enough to rip off its formula, to do that kind of sugar-on-speed super-charged yet technical gameplay that companies like Technos or SNK nailed in their old-school takes on sports. But they haven't, and maybe there's a reason for that. Maybe that killer two-button gameplay of NES faves was a perfection that we'll never reach again in the same way. Or maybe we just loved those simple games them because we didn't know what a Madden or Blitz would be like.     We're about to be schooled in old-school gameplay again, for better or not, with the return of Super Dodge Ball on the Game Boy Advance. This blast from the '80s still throws furious and has some new spin on the throw, but also has lost some air over time. If anything, it shows that there's probably a reason few have tried since to steal the winning formula -- perfect gameplay is dang hard to get right on any system and in any era, and a winning formula may be nearly as tough to get right a second time.  Features Furiously fast hot-blooded Dodge Ball fury  50 Super Throws  Nine World-Class teams  Customize your own team  13 teams to compete against  Link cable support for two players  Only for Game Boy Advance   Super Dodge Ball was always a game that lived and fried on its gameplay over graphics and sounds, so I'll just whisk one by those categories really quick before I hit the real spot of the game. Visually, it's not a breakthrough for the system and doesn't really offer the same POW as other games on the GBA. Yet even though the game doesn't taste as yummy standing next to eye candy like Advance GT, the bright cartoon visuals are a nice throwback. Switching out the old Dodge Ball super-deformed kids with ugly faces for super-deformed kids with cute detailed faces and odd Japanese hats does good to give character to the teams (although some won't appreciate the younger look of characters). The bizarre animal bonnets on some of the Dream Teams are priceless Japanese hokum. As for sounds, expect lots of triumphant synth music and lots of ~thwack~ sounds, and that's all I have to say about that. Oh, and the story is silly stupid fluff with no good ending, but who cares...  It's all a blacktop for the playground of the gameplay, so no complaints for low scores -- we never expected the game to be a dazzler. All fans of Super Dodge Ball are looking for is bulleting gameplay and impeccable balance. Taking a look at everything the GBA version adds to the Super Dodge Ball formula, there's a lot new to like. Super Throws have been added since the original, and the GBA's collection of killer zonks are wicked. Some are clever attacks that curve, speed up, hover, or split into multiball in mid-air. Others are dizzying specials that knock out multiple players at once, juggle up and deliver multiple hits on one guy, or just drop anvils on an opponent's head. Also new are Tag Team moves that can be strung together into a flurry of passes that'll snow the other guy silly.  So why isn't the game getting gushing raves from critics? Are there no hardcore gamers working the biz anymore? Or is something off? Depends. If you're just grabbing this ball because you like making kids eyes bug out, your '80s game is still here. But if you're looking for a more complete and balanced sport, Super Dodge Ball Advance is a let-down. With all the things added and all the options, there's more finicking with the controls than necessary. Pass, pass, pass all you want, but in the end, you throw the ball and hope the other guy doesn't catch the ball. Catching the ball is as simple as timing the press of the catch button. You either nail it or you get nailed. The NES game was easy like that. The GBA game is complex, throwing too much in the mix to matter.  It's still a hell of a sight watching the computer handle teammates like a pro, and once you get up to that level, the gameplay gets fairly hairy. But it always seems like there should have been things added to put the balance in. For instance, when the other guy screws up a Super Throw, you can zonk him for free, but it's tough to capitalize with really powerful throws -- landing a Super Throw of your own is near impossible. Maybe that was done to keep players from just wrecking havoc with paybacks, but in that case, there should have been more at stake -- off-sides attacks should have had more chance of going out of bounds. But the players on the sidelines are so weak and practically useless (except in Super Throw situations, which are very hard to pull off) that it wouldn't have mattered.   And the options... just not what I was expecting from vintage Technos pros. For one, Bean Ball is missing. So is the ability to play four-player or with multiple balls -- the GBA craves these things. The options that are here are good, but aren't stretched like they could have been. The Special Arenas, for instance, should have been brilliant, but instead there's nothing that adds to the gameplay. Some ramps, some obstacles, even a longer arena -- all those things would have drastically effected how you play. Instead we get some limited gravity options that just play on the game's flaws instead of really heating up the match. They were on the right track when they added the ice course, but that's as far as it goes. Same goes for the stat data -- all the right options are there (defense, speed, attack power) but you can only customize one skill, at the complete expense of the others. If Level 3 Offensive skills at least gave you certain Super Throws that Level 2 didn't, it'd make sense, but that doesn't seem to be the case. And why do we even have the option to grant a sideline player's defense when he's indestructible? Tune that dude for something useful!    This isn't an easy one to review, because there's a certain soft spot for classic games that make comebacks, and Super Dodgeball has a particularly devoted following. But as the only sports game of the GBA (sorry, but I don't count baseball), the game has a lot to live up to in giving that rush of competition, speed, strategy, and sheer energy of playing. Super Dodgeball seems like everything's in place -- the attacks are there, the means of teamwork are there, the strategies are there... but when you play, for some reason the gameplay isn't deep enough at any difficulty setting to play much more than a few solid rounds before you get bored.Why am I being so hard on a fan fave that deserves all the support it can muster? Because the game shows signs of being rushed, of not spending enough time getting kicked around in the producer's treehouse. The problem isn't Atlus USA's fault (although there are some niggling translation gaffs like an ever-changing female mascot and cornball Championship text, but those errors were to be expected and even bugged the Japanese game). It just seems like all the ideas were there, then mixed together well, but not aged right. For instance, I realize it's a classic Technos deal for Supers to require timing to throw as opposed to Fireball-type controller moves or taps, but Dodgeball is all about capitalizing on a catch or a dumb move -- without the control to launch what you want on cue, how can you deliver the pain just right? It's a fun game, but if America is only going to get one Super Dodgeball game every other decade, it better be a hell of a spanker...", "date": "Jun 14, 2001"}
