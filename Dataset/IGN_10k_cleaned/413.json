While many an issue be may debated by the left wing whackos whenever an issue on equality comes up, all men simply were not created equal when it comes to fakin' the funk on a nasty dunk.  I was more than well aware of this as a young hoopster, and though I did record the occasional throw-down on a ten footer, there was nothing quite like visiting the playground at the local elementary school and going to work on the nine foot iron that really gave me an idea of what Shawn Kemp must have felt like before he went on the lock-out diet.  By the same token, I've always had a thing for basketball video games, but despite all its simplicity and repetitiveness, there was always one series that managed to rise above the rest and give you a sense of unlimited hardwood skill:  NBA Jam. While it may not have been the most realistic game on the court, it certainly was one of gaming's most enjoying nylon nuking experience, and has since become a staple of any console platform's software line-up.  The Dreamcast is, of course, no exception in this regard, and the same crew behind the arcade classic has managed to bring the latest brand of Jam-inspired basketball to the DC in the form of a near-flawless conversion of the arcade smash, NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC.  Being a pretty big fan of the arcade version, despite the vile rubber-banding that has made this series famous, I was prepared to give this game a good ripping if it failed to measure up, but thankfully for the kids at Midway, I was met with a game that easily equals its arcade counterpart, and in many ways surpasses it.  Visually, despite a lack of intentional VGA support, we managed to get the game going on our monitor, and with the exception of the crowd, which seems to be missing a few frames of animation, the game is incredibly smooth and looks much sharper than the arcade version in many respects.  The players themselves look a bit better, and the game itself seems to move at a bit quicker pace on the whole.  Granted, the player models aren't quite up to the likes of NBA2K, but at the same time, they are quite detailed and I was more than impressed with their level of detail.  Player animations were also quite smooth, and from the game's famous over-the-top dunks to mean crossovers and post-basket celebrations, Showtime has it all, and thanks to its gratuitous nature, it is more than enough to make the opposing player feel like a bit less of a contender with each passing basket..always a plus in a grudge match.  As far as the gameplay is concerned, this is still Jam at heart, and in case you have lived under some sort of gaming rock or your frame of reference starts and ends with Sonic Adventure and Resident Evil 3, I'll fill ya in.  Basically, take everything you like about a fantastic play in basketball, magnify it by 100x, and then speed it up, and you've got Showtime in a nutshell.  Thanks to the simple nature of the game's control scheme, the DC pad handles it with ease, though the arcade stick is easily a bit more appealing for authenticity's sake.  The control itself is smooth and responsive as always, and yes, the AI still cheats like a bastard to help get the losing team back in the game.  Yeah, it helps keep the game close but one of these days, I hope it dies an evil, painful death.  Outside this, there's only one other thing to get me even the slightest bit peeved towards NBA on NBC.  To quote Midway's own campaign slogan for Gauntlet Legends, much like any arcade title, some things are better with friends.  As fun as Showtime can be between figuring out player hot spots and building up a created player, the game's most enjoyable moments are found when playing against or with friends.  Eventually, the computer simply fails to measure up without blatantly robbing you, and that's never any fun.  But with a few friends at the wheel, this is easily on of the best multi-player experiences ever created.  Thanks to its upgraded look and movement, it may even be better than its parent title in this regard.  In all fairness, multi-player isn't the only replay aspect contained in NBA.  As I mentioned earlier, create-a-player is cool, and the ability to add to your created player's attributes as you progress is cool, indeed, and there are, as always, plenty of secretes to unlock and codes to discover.  As much as I hated witnessing Tal and Steven (of IGNPC fame) take me to the hole with the ~Air Bear~ attack, it was still pretty cool to see special players in action.  If this sort of thing gets you worked up, then you'll find a lot to like with Showtime's extras.  In the end, this sort of up-and-down opinion swing characterizes NBA Showtime quite well.  If you're not obsessed with a sim-style basketball experience, then NBA on NBC remains an excellent arcade title, packed with intensity and personality.  While it may falter on occasion as a single-player experience, the multi-player aspects of Showtime will be more than enough to satisfy any video game b-ball fan and will go a long way towards pleasing the casual gamer, as well.  If this sounds like you, then you'd be well-advised to pick this one up, as it's the best homegrown arcade hoops title we've seen to date.  -- Brandon Justice, IGNDC NBA Showtime is a great game. NBA Showtime on the Game Boy is not. Midway needs to start looking at their Game Boy developments a bit more closely  sure, there's no way the Game Boy could do what the arcade does, but it could have been close. Instead, this basketball title is nothing but air.", "date": "Nov 17, 1999"}
