There were just too many opportunities to turn this game about the plight of Barry B. Benson into a rote 3D platformer with some honey-collecting scavenger hunts, so it is to developer Smart Bomb's credit that the Bee Movie Game actually pushes out the expectations of a licensed kid's movie game. That's not to say that the Bee Movie Game is a resounding success, because there are a few hitches and hiccups in the Wii edition of the game that will likely frustrate the target audience.   When the Bee Movie Game opens, Barry is recounting his life's experience to the reporter Jeanette Chung. Chronicling his life prior to the adventure depicted in the movie, Barry humbly discusses his roots in a series of small vignettes that employ a nice sense of humor. These cutscenes are not the kind you pound on the A button to skip through. Cutscenes that use in-game models actually look quite good and are a stark contrast to the scenes sliced from the movie itself, which are garishly compressed and ruined with terrible color. Seriously, check out the skin tone on some of the humans -- especially Vanessa, the woman Barry develops a, er, relationship with. Does she have jaundice?   After the set-up, we're dropped into Barry relatively banal life in New Hive City. Since this is before his legal crusade against humanity's honey thievery, Barry must earn a living by performing a collection of odd jobs. New Hive City is a decently bustling metropolis, full of bees just going about their daily routines. Barry must earn honey in the city in order to buy flight licenses that let him leave the hive (and thusly go on to the story-driven missions). To pocket some of the sweet stuff, Barry visits a job terminal inside New Hive City to accept gigs such as a factory worker, delivery boy, or cab driver. He can also race other bees.   New Hive City is hardly Liberty City, but there are some much-appreciated sandbox elements. Kids will enjoy just exploring the city and trying out these jobs. The taxi driving missions get progressively longer, as Barry zips around the downtown area taking bees to local sights, such as the Queen Bee statue or the movie theater. At the Honex factory, Barry enlists in simple tasks like collecting honey in buckets or operating a crane. These mini-games use the Wii Remote in very basic ways. Perhaps that's great for the six-year-old in your house, but slightly older gamers might be turned off by such simplistic mechanics as turning the Wii Remote to move a bucket or direct a crane.   In one of the more quizzical design decisions, Barry explores New Hive City in a car -- despite having his species preferred mode of transportation sprouting right out of his back. Driving controls are simple; it's mapped to the nunchuk with C and Z used for gas and brake. While exploring the city, players will find lots of things to gawk at, including an arcade full off classics that have been re-imagined for bees, such as Frogger and Space Invaders. This is a nice addition, even if the quality of the arcade games is mixed.   But if players want to leave the hive, Barry must fall in with the Pollen Jockeys. These high-flying bees are the hive's pollen collectors, responsible for bringing back the goods to produce honey as well as defend the hive from encroachers, such as dragonflies and wasps. When Barry leaves the hive, players enter into two different types of story missions. The better of the two is the interactive cinema, which plays out much like those classic arcade gems, Dragon's Lair and Space Ace. The free-flight sequences stumble thanks to overly complex controls that will quickly frustrate any game, young or old.   40-Love.   While outside the hive, Barry experiences the full brunt of the absolute rat race of a modern city. Barry must weave in and out of traffic, avoid trouble with humans, and in one of the game's most clever sequences, survive a tennis game. In these scenes, Barry is controlled by moving the Wii Remote and pressing buttons as directed on-screen. As Barry approaches a bus, for example, the player must direct the Wii Remote down to duck under it. But when Barry comes out in front of it, you must jam on the A button to keep him from getting sucked into the front grille. There are also moments where you must point at specific spots on the screen and press A to dodge an incoming danger or attack a target, such as a stock worker trafficking in stolen honey.   These scenes look great. They flow smoothly, filling the screen with a brilliant flurry of colors. The situations Barry gets into in these interactive cinemas are entertaining and players will want to play each of them a couple times to really see everything, especially since you spend most of the first run through just frantically looking for the on-screen prompts.   Where Bee Movie stumbles is when you have complete control over Barry. The controls scheme here is unnecessarily complex and the lock-on system does it no favors. In the wild, Barry must pollinate flowers while looking out for incoming enemies, such as those aforementioned wasps. To pollinate flowers, Barry must zoom up to a healthy flower, lock on to it, and extract the pollen by holding down the A button while pointing the Wii Remote at the bloom. After filling up his pollen gun, Barry then searches out withering flowers and douses them with pollen. When fully revived, a flower dispenses oodles of honey drops. Locking on to these flowers is iffy. Very often, Barry will lock on to a different flower or one behind the screen flower dominating the screen.   When battling other insects, Barry uses his pollen gun as a weapon. Using the nunchuk to accelerate toward trouble, players point at enemies and unload with the A button. Aim really seems to be loose. Just pointing in the general direction of a marauding dragonfly and jamming on A usually does the trick. In some garden scenes, Barry can use the environment to escape danger or defeat enemy bugs. When nearing a spider web, shake the nunchuk to send Barry speeding through it. The bug in pursuit gets caught up in the web and is consumed by a giant spider (off-screen, mercifully). Be sure to shake that nunchuk at a good distance, because if Barry gets too close -- and it's difficult to judge space in these 3D scenes -- he get caught in the web and must shake free.   Another menace in these free-flight sequences is rain. Barry cannot withstand many direct hits from rain droplets, so players must carefully chart routes in a drizzle. After zipping through the rain, Barry can rest under an awning, umbrella, or bench to recover any lost vitality. Barry does have a secret weapon to use against the rain, though: Bullet time. By pressing the d-pad, Barry slows time for a few seconds, allowing the player to dash around the droplets while seeking cover. After bullet time runs out, Barry must wait several seconds before using it again. Also useful for avoiding rainn damage -- wind gusts that rips Barry through the droplets.   The Bee Movie Game does a decent job using the Wii Remote and nunchuk combo; there is lots of shaking, pointing, and gesturing. Nothing here is necessarily revolutionary, though. Need to buzz in the face of a human to make them back off? Point Barry into the center of the screen and then shake wildly to buzz-buzz. This is only marginally better than just jamming on a button. Smart Bomb also does a solid job creating a busy, colorful game that really looks alive -- save for those awful, compressed movie scenes. This is one of the nicer-looking Wii games of the season.The younger gamer in your home will likely get a kick or two out of the Bee Movie Game, especially the New Hive City exploration and the interactive flying cinemas. (In fact, older gamers might even want to hijack the Wii Remote for those, too.) There is a lot to see and do in here, from story missions to mini-games to races. This holiday season is getting crowded with quick cash-in games for the Wii, but Bee Movie deserves to stand out from the filler.", "date": "Dec 11, 2007"}
