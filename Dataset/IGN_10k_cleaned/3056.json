TSR's old Buck Rogers pen & paper RPG was one of those, where our solar system was turned into something familiar yet strangely not. While the RPG was turned into a computer game that made its way to consoles on the Genesis, I always thought that a MMORPG around the same lines would be extremely cool. Westwood's Earth & Beyond is pretty close to that game, at least in terms of it's setting. The game takes place in the Milky Way, but sometime in the far future after mankind has expanded and explored our galaxy. Over the centuries, humanity evolved into three offshoots, and after a brutal conflict each race staked claim to one portion of our solar system and an uneasy peace was formed.   The game thrusts players into this galaxy, and allows them to live out their virtual lives as a member of one of the races. Terrans are the basic humans, they make the best traders in the galaxy and are the most balanced of the three. Progen are genetically altered warriors who make their home on Mars. They have the best weapons and armor of the three races, but sacrifice ship speed. Located on Jupiter, the Jenquai are the explorers. In exchange for the fastest ships, they have the weakest armor or weapons of the three. To mix things up a little bit, each race also has one hybrid class in addition to their standard Tradesman, Warrior, or Explorer professions that basically mixes their primary class with the Warrior profession (or Explorer in the Progen's case).   Character creation is actually quite streamlined. After you select your race/class combination, you're tossed right into defining the look of your avatar and ship. Choosing the look of your character and designing your ship from its paint scheme to its hull and wing design is basically what character creation in this game is. Players don't assign ability points to their characters at the time of creation. Instead, each race/class combo has base ability scores that you build upon as you gain levels in the game.    This allows players a bit of flexibility in the formation of their characters. You gain points to spend on abilities every time you level up. These can then be spent right away to upgrade one attribute, or saved for later use as some higher-level abilities require more experience.   As players rise in levels, more and more cool abilities will become available. One of the best examples for those going through early levels is a cool wormhole ability that Jenquai Explorers receive at level 15. Once this is gained, those Explorers can open their own wormhole to quicken their journey across the galaxy.  Not all skills are easily found, however. Some require you to really scour the galaxy and seek out the person who can teach them. These NPCs can be found on space stations, as well as on planets.   You can explore some planets in the game. When approaching one that you are able to land on, a little ~land~ option will appear above the planet in the targeting window. By clicking on that option, your ship will enter the atmosphere and you'll be able to fly around the surface of the planet (or in the atmosphere in the case of a gas giant), but warping isn't allowed. That means players will need to navigate between the nav points on the planet manually, and they can be some distance apart.    Speaking of experience, the way the game handles that is pretty unique. Unlike games such as EverQuest or Dark Age of Camelot where a player only has one experience bar, Earth & Beyond gives you three. Players gain experience via combat, trading, and exploration and each time one of the bars is filled you gain one point in that specific area of skill. For example, some Beam Weapon levels of skill not only require an ability point to gain, but also a specific level in Combat skill. But a player cannot spend the points to upgrade the skill to that level until they have also reached the required level in Combat experience.    This really makes you think of how you want to build up your character, while at the same time allowing more casual gamers to succeed in the game and have a good time without having to put in twelve hours a day into it. A player can jump in the game, run a couple of trade routes or explore a bit and walk away with enough experience or cash to feel like they accomplished something.     Once you have your character created and your ship to your liking, the game really begins. Most of a player's life will be spent from a third-person behind the ship perspective as they warp from location to location searching for new discoveries, fortune, and glory in combat. When docked at a space station, players are seen as their avatars but the controls remain the same. While in space, you navigate mostly by a handy star map. As you explore, the little question marks on the map will be fully revealed and you use the marks on the map to warp from place to place. To move from one area of space to another, you use gates that are usually found on the outskirts of an area.    As handy as the map is, I think it would've been a cool addition to the game to allow people to sell completed or partially complete maps to other players. While you'll always have players who'll want to take the easy way out by purchasing a map, there will still always be those players that would want to explore. Selling a star map would fit in well with the exploration/trade theme that goes through the game.    Westwood actually did a pretty decent job with the way the game controls by making it easy for almost anyone to pick up. You can control your movement either by holding down the right mouse button and moving it in the direction you want to go, or by moving forward with ~A~ and back with ~Z~ on the keyboard. The keyboard option is a little less intuitive than the ~WASD~ scheme so many PC gamers are accustomed to, but it gets the job done with what little movement you'll actually have to control yourself.   The reason for that is you'll be warping from location to location while in space. Each ship is equipped with a warp drive, with some naturally faster than others. While speeding to and from each navpoint in the space areas can eat up a lot of your time, you can eventually speed up the trips by purchasing faster engines and more powerful reactors for your ship.   That element of the gameplay is very time-consuming, yet fun. Players are able to upgrade the hull, weapons system, shields, engines, and reactors of their ship by purchasing, finding, or creating items. However, each part has a skill requirement attached to it, so while you're busy gaining experience in the game you also have to think about spending those skill points towards making your ship better as well.   I mentioned creating items, and that's another layer of depth in the game. Players occasionally will discover (or be given) a recipe for an item, and then by buying or finding the components, they can create weapons, ammo, and more via stations on the various starbases.    Those starbases are also where you'll do the majority of NPC interaction, although some will happen in space. The way the game handles those conversations is different than what has been done in other MMORPG's such as EverQuest. Instead of just having one text thread, there are multiple choice answers and responses. NPC interaction in this game actually is structured more like a traditional, offline, PC RPG than a MMORPG. Also, some key quest NPCs actually have full voice acting when delivering an important line that advances your quest.   Interaction with other players is a different matter. The game provides a small chat window at the top of the screen with different chat channels broken into various subjects from ~New Players~ to class-specific channels. The problem with the chat interface is that it's initially difficult to understand exactly who is reading what you type. After a while of fiddling with it and understanding how the various channels work in the game, you can figure it out, but for a new player looking for some help or advice it's rather cumbersome.   Once you find other players, grouping is encouraged and almost essential. There are certain quests in the game that are tooled specifically for a group, and due to the way the class-specific skills are; players will find that they will need to group with others when taking on larger obstacles in the game as well as making long trips. When you're out in the depths of space, you'll be thankful to have a friend with you who can repair and jump-start your ship when you get into trouble.    Players will find that Earth & Beyond's combat system that is somewhat similar to other MMORPG's, but slightly less boring. Once you have your ship equipped for battle with either a beam weapon or missiles, you can set out and look for some action. After locating something to fight, you simply target it and begin firing by hitting the button assigned to your weapon. Instead of having an ~auto attack~ like in EQ, early beam weapons must be activated each time you wish to fire them. Adding to the ~challenge~ of combat, your prey will also try to move out of range of your attacks, which means you'll have to maneuver and navigate to remain in the fight.   It's not as exciting as something along the lines as a true space combat sim (such as Wing Commander), but it isn't as boring as the ~click attack; go make a sandwich~ combat systems in other MMORPGs. And Westwood has done some things to keep at least early combat encounters interesting.   One ~newbie area~ features the player attacking small pirate ships while at the same time a giant NPC capitol ship blasts some of the extra enemies around you. It's a lot more exciting than chasing rats around the front yard of a castle, that's for sure.   Space is a dangerous place, and players aren't safe warping from place to place; especially the farther away from civilization you get. An example of this is when I wanted to take a Jenquai Explorer all the way to Earth and back, just for the exploration experience. I made it to the planet fine, but when I was warping back through the asteroid belt, I was ambushed by some pirates and made into scrap pretty quickly. Which brings us to death.   When your ship is disabled, you're basically ~dead~. You can then wait for another player to come by and jump-start your ship (a skill the some can learn), or you can send a distress message out to the last base you registered at for a tow. In addition to having the ship problems, you gain an experience debt when you die. So instead of losing experience when you die, you have a debt that takes a little bit of the experience that you gain until it's paid off. It doesn't really take that long to clear a player of an experience debt, which keeps up the pace of the game for the casual gamer.   Graphically, the game looks good, but still has some problems. Ship and player models are pretty good for a MMORPG, and there are all sorts of little effects such as some minor reflection effects for metallic surfaces, and the game supports Anisotropic filtering for some pretty solid graphics. All in all the game runs pretty smoothly, with the only bad moments coming when you enter an area of a station where there are tons of players.   The only big complaint about the graphics is that there seems to be no collision detection in the game at all. While it doesn't really affect the gameplay too much, you'll occasionally see some weird things coming out of a jump gate such as four or five ships occupying the same space.     What did you think of Earth & Beyond? In terms of audio, the game is a little subdued, which is a good thing especially in a MMORPG such as this. You don't want the music to annoy you, especially if you decide to spend a lot of time playing. The soundtrack is less along the lines of a Star Wars, and more like the ethereal stuff you'd hear on a NOVA special or Cosmos. It fits the theme of exploring our solar system rather well.   Finally, the presentation in the game is classic Westwood. If you've ever played any of their other games (C&C for example), you'd instantly know that you're playing a Westwood game as a personal assistant guides you through the entire registration process with full voice acting.   Earth & Beyond's setting, gameplay, and depth are just enough to set it apart from other MMORPGs and in the post-EQ world of online gaming, that's a good thing. The game offers just the right mix of gameplay and options for both the hardcore player and the more casual gamer. Despite some minor interface problems and some graphic glitches (caused by no collision detection), it's a very solid MMORPG that more than rewards those players who stick with it beyond the first fifteen levels or so.", "date": "Oct 14, 2002"}
