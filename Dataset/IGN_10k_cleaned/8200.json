The NES sports fan's game of choice, the game that started the football franchise craze. If you've ever been a part of a Madden football tournament, watched as EA predicts each year's Super Bowl champ with a pre-game simulation or even just hung out in pretty much any college dorm in the States on any given weekend in the past 18 years, you know the score. And you can trace it all back to Tecmo Bowl.   In the early days of the NES, Tecmo was known for its quirky, wacky titles. The company released games like the mythological platformer Rygar, the explosive action puzzler Mighty Bomb Jack, and Solomon's Key, a block-based head-scratcher that came to the VC a few months ago. With such a ridiculous repertoire, it was a bit of a shift in gears when off-the-wall Tecmo debuted a new title focused on something as mainstream and American as NFL football.    Tecmo Bowl came to arcades in 1987, housed in a humongous, double-monitor cabinet. And though players were puzzled at first by the company's new direction, it quickly became apparent  that famous Tecmo quirkiness was still in place, but it was just playing out on the gridiron instead of a maze full of monsters.          This edition isn't that arcade original, but rather the expanded and superior home version that came to the NES in February of '89. The arcade Tecmo Bowl was limited  you couldn't really pick a play, and none of the players or teams were accurate to the real deal in the NFL. But NES Tecmo Bowl improved on both counts.   First, the gameplay. You can choose two approaches  direct control over your players, or Coach Mode, where you pick plays and watch your men run them out. In both approaches you're offered a playbook of four possible plays on each possession. On offense, you select whichever of the four you believe will get you the furthest downfield, of course. But on defense, your job is to use your instincts and try to select the same play of the four that the offense did, so as to be in the best position possible to tackle the runner or intercept the pass.   Which is easy to do, considering that almost any coverage of an intended receiver in Tecmo Bowl will result in a possession-reversing interception. There's that Tecmo quirk again, as Bowl is filled with lots of little touches that aren't quite glitches, but aren't quite fair either. There are some teams in the game that are so unbalanced that tournaments wouldn't allow for their selection in '89 and the early '90s. But it wasn't really the teams themselves, so much. It was the players.   Tecmo Bowl doesn't have the NFL license, so you won't find real team names or logos. It does have the license, though, of the NFL's Player's Association  so even though he's playing for the generic ~Denver~ instead of the official Denver Broncos, you'll still find the actual John Elway lining up as QB.    Or, you would. If you were playing the NES cartridge version. Here's another example of revisionist gaming history on the Virtual Console, friends. Tecmo Bowl actually did have player names like John Elway, Mike Singletary and Dan Marino when it shipped in good old cartridge plastic 18 years ago. But licensing issues must have arisen since then, as now on the VC those names have been removed. Each player is now known only by a number.   Like the removed passwords from Kid Icarus, like the lack of ghost data saves in Mario Kart 64, and like the non-functional rumble function of Ocarina of Time, Tecmo Bowl arrives here in an unfortunately incomplete, altered form. It's a blow to the nostalgia factor, that's for sure.  Tecmo Bowl is still great fun, and especially enjoyable as a two-player experience  it's easy to see why this game was the Madden of its day. That said, though, there are a couple of caveats to any positive praise. First is the lack of player names  Tecmo Bowl never did have the real NFL teams in it, but you could fake it in your imagination when you saw ~Bo Jackson~ scroll across your screen. Now even that is gone. And, second, this is Tecmo Bowl. Not Tecmo Super Bowl. It's an important distinction, because most people's fond memories actually apply to the latter, which was the 1991 sequel to this 1989 game. Tecmo Super Bowl added much more to the experience. More teams, more plays, and, most important, the actual NFL license, allowing for the real logos and team names. Don't discount this game, as this first NES Tecmo Bowl has a lot to offer. But also don't hold out hope for any imminent arrival of its superior sequel  if this release is any indication, Tecmo Super Bowl may arrive in the future, but it would probably be similarly doctored and stripped of anything NFL.", "date": "Mar 13, 2007"}
