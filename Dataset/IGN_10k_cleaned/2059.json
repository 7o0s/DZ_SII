Everything from Colin McRae Rally to Driver will let you get the leadfoot urge out of your system, if you so desire.  Into the crowded racing space comes Hot Wired, a new racer from Xicat Interactive. The object this time: race away from the cops, since the game puts you in the role of car thief, that would seem logical.   To open the game, you're treated to cool, animated menus that swish and zoom around, giving you the game options with a bit of style.  It's not long, though, before you're presented with a serious problem: You can choose a gamepad to play with, but there's no way to configure it. And worse yet, we could never get the darn thing to work. The keyboard was the only control option left open to us, since controlling the car with the mouse was a bit like trying to come to a complete stop on a linoleum floor covered with butter and axle grease.  Once you get into the game, you'll see fairly decent graphics. But even before you begin the race you'll hear what we're guessing is supposed to be a gangster voice in a rather amusing impression. The only problem is, it gets a little tiresome after hearing it for about the tenth time.  The game's tagline is ~become the ultimate car thief,~ and it will put you to that test. You'll choose from among 10 cities to drive in, from Miami and New York, to Dallas, Portland, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Atlanta. Of course, only Miami, LA and New York are unlocked to begin with. You'll have to progress through the levels to open the rest of the cities. We were left wondering though, why no San Francisco? Obviously, we're a little biased because we live here, but it seems like a perfect place to set a racing game, what with all the hills and everything.  Having all those cities to choose from is a good idea, but it would have been better had the backgrounds actually reflected your selection of a different city. Instead, what the game offers is very similar driving surrounding until you get close to the city, and then a different skyline, depending on which city you've chosen. In essence, all the cities' driving backgrounds are very, very similar.  The cars you get to choose from are all pretty cool, but they're not real cars. For instance, to start with, you'll be able to select from the Twilight Stellar with a top speed of 187 m.p.h., the Inca 2K, which reaches speeds of 176 m.p.h., or the XiCat SI, with a top speed of 195 m.p.h.  The cars look very good as you drive them around, and you can choose from among 12 views to keep tabs on the action. There's the first-person view (inside the car), as well as several views outside the car, from the rear, front, and trackside. You get to pick from seven different cars to race against the fuzz, although only three of them are unlocked to start the game.  Track backgrounds are well-drawn, too. Since you're driving in the middle of the night, you'll see the faint glow of the moon as you zip down the freeways, not to mention nice lens flare on the streetlights as you zoom by them.  The tracks look excellent, as well, with solid framerates and little to no pop-in as you zoom towards the city. The sensation of speed is good, as the scenery zips by quickly. The only trouble is that many of the obstacles in your way aren't obstacles at all. Drive through a light pole, and what happens? Nothing. Flash through a street sign and what's the result? Your car doesn't even slow down. You'll bounce off chain-link fences and bridge abutments as you drive down the freeways, rather than actually crashing into them, as you should.  Another knock on the realism is that when you approach intersections in the cities, there aren't any cars coming from the other direction. That's disappointing, since what you're really looking forward to in this game is the chance to narrowly avert disaster.  In fact, the only time your car does slow down by any appreciable amount is after ramming into another car on the freeways. And when that happens, the game does show off some nice damage models, denting your fenders, hood and trunk enough to make you think twice about driving recklessly. The crash effects are all fairly impressive, with nice damage to your car, and cool smoke billowing from your wreck. In fact, if you crash hard enough, you can jar loose wheels on the car, making them stick out from under your fenders at odd angles, and really slowing down your top speed in the process.  Sound in the game is decent, although there is admittedly not much more than engine sounds to hear. Occasionally, you'll hear the chatter of cops on the radio as they get set to try and take you down. Stuff like, ~He's coming this way!~ or ~I'm on his tail~ are scattered around with frequency, and the voice acting for the cops is pretty good, too.  The overall object of the game is to take the car of your choice, and get away from the cops. To do that, you've got to get across the county line (because everyone knows that once you cross the county line, they stop chasing you ... at least that's what they taught us in Dukes of Hazzard and Smokey and the Bandit). If you get across the county line without getting caught by the squad cars, you'll get some cash as a score.  Save up your cash, and you'll be able to unlock some additional cars to race with. If you've got 25,000 big ones, for instance, you'll be able to unlock the police car to race with. For 40,000, you can unlock the semi truck with ~Mr. Peepers~ on the side to barrel down the freeways.  The police are obviously your biggest adversary, and the cop AI in the game isn't too bad. For the most part, in the game, they'll be on your tail the whole time, with six or seven squad cars tailing you as you zoom down the freeway at speeds exceeding 100 m.p.h. Occasionally, though, the police will come from the other direction and try to head you off. Although usually, that tactic isn't too successful, since the freeways are usually divided by a guardrail, and so they can't cross over to your side to try to get in front of you.  All in all, Hot Wired is a nice diversion, allowing you to zip down the freeway as fast as humanly possible (or probably, as fast as you've wanted to in real life). But there are enough significant problems here that it doesn't end up being much more than a drive in the park on a slow afternoon.  -- Mike Morrissey  Want to share your opinions with the world?
