While most of the email consist of rants on why this DC title has been canceled, miscellaneous PSO questions, flame mails from my Evil Dead review, and the assorted spam mail regarding teen cheerleaders, occasionally I receive complaints from old-school gamers wondering what happened to the difficulty level of games.  To a certain extent, I have to agree ? in order to grab a larger market of gamers, games seem to be ~dumbed down~ so everyone can be a winner!  Good thing there's a few video game companies that still believe in making ~frustrating-to-the-point-of-pitching-your-controller-against-the-wall~ games, and if you're up to the challenge, Capcom's Mars Matrix delivers.   Like most 2D shooters, the story to Mars Matrix is pretty light.  Choose between two ships and save Mars from an onslaught of enemies by the preferred method in all shooting games ? blowing up everything to smithereens.  Both ships have only one main weapon: the red rocket launches spread-like swarms of bullets while the blue battleship delivers a concentrate beam of hot death.  How do you get additional weapons? Uh... you don't.  But what you can do is level up your weapon by collecting the gold that's released from decimated enemies.  The faster you collect the gold, the longer the combo meter - that measures how fast you collect gold - stays on the screen, thereby powering-up your main weapon quickly.  So there's an immediate balance between staying alive and grabbing as much gold as you can; thank god you don't have to worry about colliding with enemy units.  And to increase your gold intake, you have to utilize the ~mosquito~ feature with maximum efficiency.   Probably the biggest gameplay feature in Mars Matrix is the mosquito ability of your ship.  At the bottom of the screen, you'll see a meter and as long as it's full, you'll be able to use the mosquito ability of sucking enemy fire.  When used properly, you can vacuum the bullets of opposing forces and while the bullets hovering around your fighter, send it back to the enemies with a quick motion of the D-pad.  It takes some time to properly send enemy fire back as it requires you to watch the momentum of your ships and the floating bullets.  But once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to send waves of enemy firepower back with huge gold bonuses.  You do have to be careful as the longer you hold the mosquito ability, the longer it takes to recharge the meter.  Finally, if you constantly suck in enemy missiles you'll eventually release the Black Hole Bomb that destroys everything onscreen.  It's a good maneuver to use when you're in a jam, but be aware you'll be waiting awhile before you can use the mosquito ability again.  And in the later levels, you're really going to depend on your ships ability to suck enemy fire, as the game gets monstrously difficult.   Mars Matrix is a pretty evil game; when you start the first level, the game throws a few tough enemies, but for the most part, it's pretty easy.  Then comes stage 2 and the enemy comes at you with absolutely no mercy.  Halfway through the second stage, the screen is absolutely crammed with small circular pixels that possess the touch of death.  And don't even get me started on the phoenix boss as I had to be restrained from my fellow editors from kicking my 20~ Sony Trinitron.  But don't give into ~decreased difficulty~ or the ultimate sign of weakness ? cheat devices!  Even I, a meek gamer that wails like a 12-year old girl, was able to learn the proper times to use the mosquito ability and exactly how to place my ship in a sortie of enemy missiles.  And the rewards are definitely worth it as the game keeps a cumulative track of your total score.  With this score, you'll be able to purchase new modes, options, and unlock hidden features at the Shop feature.  The strategy mode is highly recommended as it shows the player exactly how to maximize their gold profits.   Mars Matrix isn't flawless especially in the visual department.  Mixing in polygons with 2D sprites isn't something new and in many cases, it doesn't look that great in Mars Matrix.  Pixelization occurs from time to time and there is a touch of slowdown when the situation gets really intense.  Additionally, collision detection is a bit iffy; there have been times I've encountered a shower of enemy firepower and somehow, after passing through a couple of enemy bullets, I made it through.  And I have to admit as much as I like tough games, Mars Matrix really got on my nerves in some of the stages (i.e. Phoenix boss).  But it's rare that a game challenges my video game manhood and, in between leveling my PSO characters, I'm going to spend a few hours a week on Mars Matrix.  If you're one of those gamers that constantly needs a challenge or if you're looking for something that'll test your gaming mettle, Mars Matrix might be up your shooting alley.", "date": "Apr 30, 2001"}
