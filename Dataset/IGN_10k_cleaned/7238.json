Namco's mascot -- one of the video game industry's true mascots -- is staking out another screen: the iPod. Namco has prepped their hero to compete with music, podcasts, and video on Apple's bestselling portable media device. But how does this seminal experience rate on a platform that has no joystick, much less a directional pad, for proper gaming?   Unfortunately, not well.   The click wheel is just not capable of replicating a good dedicated video game controller, even though the engineers over at Namco made a solid effort to do so. Instead of clicking the wheel in the four cardinal directions to move Pac around his mazes, you run your finger along the wheel to point a virtual joystick the direction you want Pac to go at the next corner. An on-screen joystick icon shows you the current direction of the virtual stick, but taking your eyes off the maze can prove quite dangerous. The control scheme just doesn't work well, even after several warm-up games. Over-steering Pac is just too easy, especially when you get in a bit of a pickle -- most actually caused by not being able to turn when you really wanted to.   (Added 9/19/2006: I need to clarify something -- even though you can lightly touch the wheel where you want Pac to go on the next possible corner (you don't have to literally slide you finger around the wheel), I felt the controls were just not accurate enough to really get in a good game of Pac-Man.)   On the brighter side -- but not bright enough to warrant a purchase -- is that the game looks and sounds pretty close to the original. The maze's vertical orientation is preserved by filling only about half of the screen. The rest is occupied by scores and the joystick icon.  Pac-Man is usually a reliable pleasure, but this iPod edition just doesn't work any magic. The control scheme is not an acceptable substitution for a regular four-way directional set-up -- and there's no way to change it. (Update: Meaning, you have no other option than to use the click wheel since the iPod has no external controls. And I believe the click wheel is not an adequate substitute for the joystick in a precision game like Pac-Man.) The novelty of having Pac on your iPod wears off after just a play or two.
