Nostalgia might try to argue otherwise, but the Cruis'n series of arcade racers has always been simple, straightforward and shallow  not really worthy of the praise it's been offered by vast numbers of fans over the years. Even today we still strive to have high hopes for the franchise, but only set ourselves up to have those hopes dashed again and again. So don't get your hopes up for Cruis'n USA on the Virtual Console. It's never been good.   Cruis'n USA is an arcade racing game that puts you behind the wheel of one of four different cars and sends you out across the highways of North America. The hook of its environments is that you'll come across various American monuments and landmarks while you're racing, like Mount Rushmore, the Grand Canyon and California's Redwood Forest. The hook of its gameplay, though, is hard to find  as this is essentially just a ~hold down the gas and steer~ design that does little to add anything innovative to the driving experience.   You start each race at the back of a pack of nine, and a countdown clock starts ticking down to zero immediately after the checkered flag is waved. You only have that set number of seconds to make significant progress on the current course  significant progress being indicated by ~checkpoints~ that appear every few miles. Passing through one of the checkpoints adds time back on to the countdown clock, and gives you an update on where you stand in relation to the next nearest racer. The goal, of course, is to clear every checkpoint as fast as you can, blow past the rest of the pack and come in first to the finish line  where bikini-clad 2D women will celebrate you with a trophy and a set of odd, jerky animations.   Don't worry, the rest of the bridge is there. It just won't render until you're 50 feet away.  It's a formula that served the purpose of an arcade machine well  you would drop in a quarter, drive fast for a few minutes, get a high score and move on to the next coin-op cabinet  but as a full-on console game, it left a lot to be desired. And that's the feeling that still marks Cruis'n USA today. Though the instant gratification you get from being able to quickly sail past a pack of rival racers and take first place is invigorating at the start, there just isn't any depth to keep the design going beyond its first few minutes' worth of appeal.   Not to mention the game's technical issues. Cruis'n USA first arrived in arcades in 1994, making it one of the earliest 3D polygonal racers on the market. And by the time it was ported to the Nintendo 64 two years later, it already looked outdated. Add an additional 12 years to that time point to bring the game to today's VC, and you're looking at some seriously limited 3D visuals here.    The cars are as basic as can be, with very little detail contained within their models and almost no animation to speak of. If two or more cars collide during the race, the result is an incredibly unrealistic collision reaction that looks like two shoeboxes hit each other in mid-air and then went flying in different directions.    But worse than that is Cruis'n USA's horrendous amount of pop-up. This game is one of the industry's most notorious titles for poor draw distance, as objects meant to appear off in the distance only actually render themselves visible once you get to be about 100 feet away. Trees appear out of thin air, as do signs, buildings and bridges. The Redwood Forest level is especially bad  as you drive along what looks to be an open-air highway out on the plains, a dense crop of trees just pops out of nowhere to change the stage into the forest it's billed as. It's odd, it's distracting, and it takes away from the action at hand.Cruis'n USA was a poor game when it was first released for the Nintendo 64 over a decade ago, and it's still a poor game today. Though nostalgic memories might make our minds recall a more compelling title, this racer is simply shallow, too straightforward and technically flawed to be truly worth an investment of 1000 Wii Points. That said, though, spending 10 bucks on a download of this version of Cruis'n is likely a more wise decision than spending 30 on the recent physical disc abomination that Midway pushed onto store shelves a few months ago. Stay away from that one at all costs.", "date": "Apr 2, 2008"}
