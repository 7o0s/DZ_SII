The comment drew applause. And then the game did, too, because Super Boom Boom is an instantly accessible title that any gamer (mobile or otherwise) will thoroughly enjoy.Here's the set-up: You command a group of pirates with a hankering for treasure, but to breach the defenses and get the goods, you have to fire bombs up through a network of moving baskets. The only button used in the entire endeavor is either 5 or OK, which pops the bomb out of the current basket. This is a game of timing, so as soon as you ~get~ the rhythm of the game, you're in like Flynn. Finding the groove is the trick of the game, though. Admittedly, my first few attempts ended in early failure -- and in front of Gamevil representatives no less. With a little practice, though, I figured out the proper timing and scaled the levels not with ease, but certainly with a greater degree of confidence.Only the first stage is just moving baskets. As you push deeper into the game, you encounter new traps like trampolines, pulleys, poles, birds, and fire. Some traps must be avoided, but others can be used to vault your bomb even higher. You don't have long to figure them out, though, as a constantly ticking timer means you have to keep moving. If you don't reach the top in time, the bomb explodes. You also don't get to drop back down the screen either. If you miss the next basket, you cannot catch it in the previous one. The game is not particularly forgiving, but because the levels are so well designed, it's never frustrating.There is plenty of game in the regular mode, but you can also try out an Endless run to see just how high you can get a bomb. (This is a lot like Skipping Stone's distance.)Gamevil employs a nice cartoon look for the game that reminded me an awful lot of The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. Super Boom Boom is outrageously colorful. Gamevil really has excellent artists. The audio is great, too. This is a quality production that proves you only need smart art direction, not a bunch of polygons, to make an attractive, stylish game.Super Boom Boom cements Gamevil as a mobile maker to watch -- this is great entertainment. With great art, a winning concept, and simple controls, Super Boom Boom feels like the spiritual successor to Skipping Stone, which was my game of the year in 2005. And now, deciding the game of the month for April is going to be very, very tough. But the decision you must make to download this game is very, very easy. Super Boom Boom is a hell of a lot of fun.", "date": "Apr 18, 2007"}
