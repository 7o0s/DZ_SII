Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge was actually planned for release way earlier than it actually was, but the internal politics put its development on the backburner. It's not clear if the extra time behind the scenes actually helped the product along, but the end result is an extremely close representation of the Banjo-Kazooie game design developed for the Nintendo 64 system. But instead of an elaborate 3D engine, the team ~flattened~ the look and feel in order to make it work on the GBA hardware. It's a decent effort with only a few flaws keeping it from being a truly classic handheld adventure. Features More than a dozen different, acquired moves Five levels, one overworld Ten different mini-game challenges Cartridge save (three slots)  The story of Banjo-Kazooie is a strange one, but in a nutshell, Banjo is a happy-go-lucky bear, and Kazooie is his cranky bird friend that lives in his backpack. They've thwarted evil Gruntilda's plans once in the original Banjo-Kazooie, and again in Banjo-Tooie, and it seems that Grunty's not too pleased about this outcome. Through a little magic and science, her lackey Klungo's managed to resurrect her after her run-in with Banjo and Kazooie at the end of Banjo-Tooie. Now quite a bit more cheesed off and in a gigantic mechanized suit, Grunty's ultimate plan: to go back in time, before the original Banjo-Kazooie and prevent Banjo and Kazooie from ever meeting. She hops off to Banjo's abode, birdnaps Kazooie and zaps into the past, leaving Banjo to go after her.  This story is extremely half-baked because, honestly, barely anything in the game ever refers to time travel. Players never manipulate the space-time continuum with anything they do. It's a badly-written plot that's supposed to tie the whole game together, but the result is a tale that's limply woven with some missed opportunities for in-jokes or references to past Banjo games.  But even though the plot is weak, the game design isn't; Rare's first GBA title is just as deep and extensive as the original Banjo-Kazooie game released on the Nintendo 64. Grunty's Revenge, like the past games in the series, revolves around players, as the Banjo-Kazooie pair, wandering around different locations collecting musical notes, puzzle icons known as ~jiggies,~ and lost little Jinjo critters that look like refugees out of a Fraggle Rock episode. The task is, of course, to collect everything that's scattered around the environments, because as silly as they look, every item has a point.  Musical notes, for instance, are used as currency whenever players need to acquire a specific ability. See, in the beginning, all Banjo can do is walk, jump, and slap his big backpack against enemies, since at the beginning of the game Kazooie is lost somewhere in the past. Collecting enough musical notes will get Bozzeye the mole (if that's a pun, I don't get it) to teach Banjo a brand new, helpful move. These moves are absolutely crucial in accessing different locations in the game, since many areas are inaccessible without performing a specific move or technique. Other places are actually locked away, and players will need to collect enough Jiggy pieces to break the gates of the different locations. Rescuing the Jinjo creatures aren't as important, since they're only really hiding a Jiggy piece...and it's only when players rescue all the Jinjos in each location that they'll give up the piece. All the collectible items are recorded through an easy-to-follow statistics screen that shows each location and how many of each hidden item have been collected; and trust me, you'll be referring to this screen many times, especially if you're trying to complete the game 100 percent.  But even though collection is Banjo-Kazooie's focus, the challenge comes from exactly how these items have to be acquired. Some are a simple matter of following a string of musical notes, but others require a bit more skill. Players will have to leap across chasms to grab an out-of-reach Jiggy or Jinjo, or hit a trigger and try to score a revealed Jiggy before the clock runs out. There are also a handful of mini-games outside of the platform gameplay, like a fishing challenge that's somewhat similar to the one Rare created for the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance versions of Donkey Kong Country.  There are also vehicle challenges where players must compete against three computer opponents in a race to collect the most objects or hold onto a specific item the longest. What's interesting is that this game was originally announced to have some link cable support for multiplayer challenges; the multiplayer modes have been removed from Banjo-Kazooie, but it's pretty obvious that these mini-games are residue from the original link cable intention. And it's a shame that these vehicle challenges aren't multiplayer since it would have been a feature that added a lot to the replay value.  Banjo-Kazooie starts out extremely slow and easy, which may turn off some folks since there's really not a whole lot of challenge right from the start. Everything players need to complete the early challenges are almost spoon-fed to them, and boss battles are an absolute joke since there's honestly no mystery or challenge in defeating them. But give it time, because the difficulty curve is a gradual one...and when it's time to fight Grunty in the final battle, much of what you've learned in the adventure will be put to the test. Literally. Folks who've played through either N64 Banjo games will understand what I mean. And even when the game's over, the developers steal an idea from Super Monkey Ball for the credits, and tokens earned here can then be used to buy existing challenges from an arcade machine hidden in one of the levels.  But the game isn't a cakewalk, but it is over pretty quickly; gamers can complete the adventure in six hours, skilled gamers slightly less.    At the very least, Rare did a wonderful job recreating the look and feel of the original Nintendo 64 game utilizing the strengths of the Game Boy Advance system. The team rendered the Banjo-Kazooie lead in 3D for silky smooth animation; considering there are more than a dozen moves players can pull off in the game, and many of these move has to be rendered with the characters facing more than four different directions, that's a lot of animation on the cartridge. The sound engine is just as impressive, mimicking the same audio style the Banjo N64 team pulled off on that system; the music is solid and catchy, and each character ~speaks~ with a goofy, digitized gibber...it sounds silly, but that's the designers' intention.  The biggest issue in Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge is its perspective. Since the game utilizes 3D-style platform hopping in a 2D, overhead engine, it's extremely difficult to judge height and distance since the reference between platforms isn't as clear as if it was rendered in realtime 3D. The developers do their best to help players orient themselves through well-drawn backgrounds and a shadow under the characters...but even then some tiling issues in some areas make it difficult to tell what's a platform and what's simply a vertical wall. At the very least, players will remember the height differences since the game requires them to continuously go back and forth over the different levels multiple times in order to collect every single item in the game. The story is incredibly weak, the boss battles lack imagination, and the adventure's a little on the short side. But Rare's first Game Boy Advance title still impresses with incredibly solid platform-style gameplay, recreating the style established on the Nintendo 64 a half-year ago. It's a challenge while it lasts, and at the very least Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge shows that Rare has a talented team working on Game Boy Advance titles. We can't wait to see the studio's next handheld game.", "date": "Sep 12, 2003"}
