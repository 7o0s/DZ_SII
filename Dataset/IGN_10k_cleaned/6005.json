A shooter entirely in the vein of Space Harrier (but not so much that they can expect a call from Yu Suzuki's lawyers), the Ditto-developed game casts players as the titular space butt-kicker. Too bad the camera is focused so tightly on Carnage's butt so as to prevent the player from seeing too much of the action. It's a design decision that really cut into my enjoyment of the game, and I suspect it's a complaint that will be echoed by many mobile gamers that surrender their hard-earned cash for it. (Note: Major Carnage 3D costs $7.99 on Cingular, for example.)   Major Carnage 3D can fly all over the screen, firing his cannon at the waves of enemies that come at him from the front and flanks. But unlike the Harrier hero, Carnage is pretty much stuck in the center of the screen. Pressing in any direction moves Carnage a little, but adjusts the background a whole lot. Add in the physical size of Carnage on the screen and the problem of Major Carnage 3D truly emerges: You can hardly see what you're shooting at. When you line Carnage up for his shot, you can't see if the enemy is returning fire. Ugh. This causes the kind of frustration that makes one almost consider throwing their Sony 710 across the room. Almost.   The one design flaw completely undercuts the rest of the game's achievements. The scrolling levels are impressively, especially the land-bound ones like the trench runs and the planetside routes. Several of the enemy craft are nicely designed, too, such as the mid-round and end-round bosses. The visual elements come together quite well, and Ditto gives the proceedings enough personality to suggest a potential franchise.  Major Carnage 3D actually had all of the elements to be a fun action game, but whatever goodwill I had for the game was unceremoniously executed by what I perceived as a massive design flaw. Should Major Carnage 3D get a second tour of duty, for the love of Samsung, please adjust the camera and let Carnage out of his invisible box.", "date": "Sep 12, 2005"}
