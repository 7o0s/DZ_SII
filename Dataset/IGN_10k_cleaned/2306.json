Based on an obscure boardgame, it arrived from Sweden with little fanfare and a charmingly inept manual. Complicated, yes, but one of the best pure strategy games released in years, particularly in terms of fresh design.  Much of what the player did fell into the traditional realm of strategy gaming -- you spent money building armies, improving your cities and colonies, and investing in scientific research. But Europa added new ingredients to the mix. Its diplomacy model was sophisticated, among the best yet in a computer game, and it was one of the few titles to actually model religion as a factor in international relations and domestic dissent.   Furthermore, its historically-accurate, province-based map gave Europa Universalis the kind of verisimilitude simply not found in other historical strategy games, like Civilization, Imperialism, Caesar II or Colonization, to name a few. With a variety of scenarios hitting many key points in history, the game revealed itself as a powerful lens into the politics of the 16th through 19th Centuries.  Make no mistake though, EU was no thrall to history. Because of random events and the actions of a human player, any game of EU would quickly veer off of our historical timeline and morph into something unrecognizable. This is another part of its charm, this ability to play with alternate histories. Could England retain her American colonies? Can Scotland remain free? What if Sweden became a power in the New World, or Russia conquered Byzantium? Deservedly, the first game got a shining review.  The Sequel  As strong as the first game was, there was room for improvement, and shortly after the initial release, the developers began work on number two. Now, less than a year later, that game has arrived. Europa Universalis II is here. The good news is that EU 2 is packed with new options, decisions, and playable countries. The game's been broadened and deepened in many ways. The bad news is I'm still not convinced there's enough here to justify a full-priced sequel, so that's something you'll have to decide for yourself.  First, the good news. The timeline has been extended all the way back to 1419 and Joan D'Arc, and forward to 1820, the Age of Napoleon. The scope of the game has increased too -- hundreds of new provinces and playable countries have been added to the map, and much of the non-European world, previously inhabited only by non-competitive natives, has been beefed up with full-blown kingdoms and empires. Furthermore, all these countries are playable, so it's possible to carve out an empire using the Incas or Dahomey or the Chinese, well before the European explorers ever arrive. My Japanese grand campaign, for example, is actually very peaceful  -- during one hundred years, I've had one minor war with Korea and a couple of random event-created revolts. China annexed Manchuria, Korea is my vassal, and I know absolutely nothing about the rest of the world, and am furiously trying to develop naval technology, because I don't think I'm ever going to get any explorers.  But that's what's fun about this game, every country's position is pretty unique. And what's impressive is that even though you only control one country, all the others are in play too -- an AI traffic control nightmare, I'd have to imagine, which is why this game is so good. I don't know of another strategy game that has as many countries acting independently during a game. You may have anywhere from fifty to a hundred countries all engaging in trade, warfare, and diplomacy all at once, and what happens in one country can have a ripple effect throughout the world elsewhere.   Civilization contains a paltry handful of ~civilizations~ compared to this game, and the complex web of military alliances, trading agreements, and politico-religious divisions is both compelling and extremely realistic. This is not a game for those who fear complexity, but if you're a detail-oriented kind of person, you'll be enthralled. At one moment you might be trying to calculate if you'll have enough diplomats to create a new alliance, then a random event will crop up that will cost a huge slice of your treasury, or throw you into debt. And of course you almost never have enough money to do everything you want to do.  Probably the biggest new feature of the game is the addition of domestic policy sliders. Before, every country was hard-coded in many ways -- Russia always had cheap but plentiful troops, because presumably serfdom never went away there. Now serfdom and freedom can be set along a sliding scale, along with about ten other factors from free trade vs. protectionism to army-centered vs. naval power. What's best about these sliders is that you can only move one slider once every ten years, and doing so costs a stability point. That really makes you plan ahead, and it's more realistic. So yes, pretty much everyone in Russia is a serf, but if you want to change that it you can, gradually and realistically over time. That's cool.  However, not every feature of the game has been so thoroughly worked over. One that's largely unchanged is combat. I find Europa's combat system to be vaguely unsatisfying because it's essentially out of your control. The best you can do is make sure you have enough troops to do what you need doing, and that their morale and quality is high enough. But that is the situation real world leaders face, so maybe it's not such a bad deal. Still, it would've been nice to have something more tangible in the sequel, but the only major addition to combat in Europa 2 is the addition of mercenaries, ordinary troops that are always available but at an extremely inflated price. Why not things like razing a province or buying off rival mercenaries too? Assassinating leaders? Intelligence coups? Wouldn't raising massive armies in the same provinces, year after year, eventually inhibit population growth and increase the local chance of revolt?  A final feature worth discussing is annexation, since this equation lies at the heart of the game mechanic, and as any experienced player knows, it's primarily through annexation that your empire grows. This is especially true of the sequel, which begins fifty-three years before Columbus, so initially there's hardly anywhere you can colonize. So here's the problem. In the first game, if you occupied every province of an enemy you could simply annex them. It would play hell with your diplomatic rating, but usually you'd do it anyway. This sort of dragged the excellent diplomatic model of the first game down a little, because a good player would just go on an annexation feeding frenzy and get powerful very quick, and not worry about repercussions -- relations can only get so low, and then there was no further penalty.  Presumably, in order to nix that kind of approach, the game now won't let you annex an entire country at once. You have to get them down to one province first, then you can annex them. Plus, now the AI is so stubborn at the peace table that it seems like you literally have to conquer and occupy their entire country just to make them give you one province. Then you have to do it again to get the next one five years later, etc. That really seems like an artificial restraint to put on a player, and I think it would've been better to simply make it harder for a player to utterly defeat a country in the first place, by making military maintenance higher or making the diplomatic penalty for continuous annexation so dire -- let ratings slip from -200 down to -1,000 where every country in the world stops trading with you and attacks and burns all your fleets and colonies on sight -- that players would think twice about military conquest, particularly of co-religionists. And make diplomatic annexation easier! As it is, there's a 10% chance it will work, but after twenty years it should be double, thirty years 50%, etc. Aargh.  Anyway, those are some of the major new features and changes in the game. I've already written extensively about some of the rest in the preview, so I'm not going to mindlessly recapitulate them here -- they won't make much sense if you haven't played the game yet anyway. I will say this though -- they changed the game quite a bit, and that EU 2 is now the game EU 1 should've been all along. Or at least it would be, if it hadn't been so rushed.  One problem with trying to get the sequel out by Christmas was that there wasn't enough time to truly overhaul the presentation or graphics in the game, so it might be hard to shake the feeling that this could just as easily have been an expansion pack. This is not the huge leap in graphics that we saw from say, Civilization I to Civilization II, which was a product of refinement and elaboration over a period of years. But on the other hand it's not fair to just look at the graphics and say there's been no significant changes -- most of the changes are design-related and show up mainly in the text and numbers. These have already been discussed.  Another problem, one that is probably more reparable, is the bugginess of the initial release. In the rush to hit the all-important North American holiday shopping season, the game was knowingly shipped with a number of bugs, the proof of which is that the first patch was being readied before the game even hit the shelves. We'd be here all day if I tried to list every minor bug, so here's just a few: it can be impossible to cancel a vassalization with another country, new alliance members join existing wars against you without bothering to inform you of that fact, and it's impossible to check on your policy settings when presented with a random event.  The latter bug is particularly annoying. Let's say I get an event that says the peasants are upset, and I can either lose 100 ducats and gain one Centralization point, or I can lose four Stability but keep all my money. When this event happens, a dialog box pops up and asks me which I want to do. I can easily look on the top of the screen and see where my Stability and Treasury currently stand, but checking the new, ~Slider Traits~ like Centralization, etc., simply can't be done while the game is paused and awaiting my response.  But I'm sure these nagging bugs will all eventually be patched out, because the game's developer, Paradox Entertainment, runs an excellent interactive community online, where bug reports are actively collected and team members regularly inform the game's following on what's going on with the state of the game. All developers should be this attentive!  More curious is the multiplayer mode. Currently you can play over the Internet, over a LAN, and find opponents on their matchmaking server, but I experienced a number of crashes and some lag on the Internet, and there's gonna be a real dearth of opponents for any one user locally, since this is a game with a real niche audience. But I honestly don't care much about multiplayer in a game like this. The engine makes it impossible to play it turn-based by e-mail, and who can actually get half a dozen people together to play a historical simulation for hours and hours at a time? A few diehards, perhaps.  So is there enough here to justify a sequel? Not really, but EU 2 is enough of an improvement that you'll have to go buy it anyway. If you loved the first one, you'll love the second one. If you never played the first one but all this sounds very interesting to you, then you'll love this one too. Only if you didn't like the first one or simply don't like massively addictive, time-consuming, leviathan-sized strategy games (which is a distressingly large number of you), then you should probably steer clear -- but you don't need me to tell you that.  Europa Universalis 2 is going through some growing pains, but if you're at all interested in history or empire-building games, you owe it to yourself to play this game.  -- Jason Bates      Want to share your opinions with the world?
