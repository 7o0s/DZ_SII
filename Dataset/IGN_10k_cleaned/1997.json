{"name": "Bloody Roar 3", "name_review": "Bloody Roar 3", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/06/26/bloody-roar-3", "text": "The first rank of fighting games, and the select group of developers that make them, is defined very clearly in this day and age.  Ask more or less anyone, and they will tell you: there is Namco, there is AM2, there is Team Ninja, and then there is Everybody Else.  Or to put it more appropriately, there is nobody else.  Tekken, Soul Calibur, Virtua Fighter and Dead or Alive have captured the lion's share of the attention in the genre since the peak of the Playstation era, when DOA came out of nowhere to become a recognized contender.   Which Bloody Roar never quite was.  Raizing's lycanthropic fighter had two outings on the PlayStation, both localized by Sony and met respectably at the box office, but the franchise never seemed to earn the respect that Dead or Alive pried loose from the market and that Tekken and Virtua Fighter seemingly possessed by default.  DOA's next-generation debut received a flurry of hype and anticipation, while the eventual arrival of Bloody Roar 3 on System 246 and PS2 barely raised eyebrows.   Unfair?  To a degree.  Bloody Roar 3 is not the toe-to-toe equal of Soul Calibur or Tekken Tag Tournament, and it's not as ambitious as DOA2 in some ways, but it's undeniably fun as a solo or multiplayer game, and every so often it throws out a moment of serious graphical flair.  It's certainly worthy of its American release, which has come thanks to Activision, and it's worth the attention of those looking for something off-beat in a fighting game.   Gameplay  Bloody Roar's gimmick is the inclusion of monstrous alter egos for each of its characters -- the werewolf's the cover boy, but there's also the were-leopard, the were-lion, the were-tiger, the were-rhino beetle, and something called the Unborn, the definition of which has never yet been satisfactorily explained.  The cast runs the gamut of visual and technical fighting styles, both in and out of their bestial forms, which they can swap between almost at will.  ~Almost~ is the kicker, though.  The game's chief strategic element involves managing the energy meter that allows the transformation, and knowing when to use the extra attacks that it enables.   See, characters can fight in human form, but not nearly as effectively as when they're packing giant fangs and sharp claws (or antennae, or giant prehensile spiky things, or floppy ears and a cotton tail).  Beast form enables stronger combos, and you can sacrifice your entire store of beast energy on the gamble that as a massive Beast Drive -- hit or miss, you return to human form, but it's worth it if you can land in excess of 20 hits.    Offensively, then, Bloody Roar 3 has a lot of flash and a reasonable amount of depth.  The combo scheme should be familiar to someone with a grasp of Dead or Alive or the more basic elements of Tekken -- characters have a decent-sized selection of attacks based on directional movements and the two attack buttons, with preset combos generally ranging from two to six hits (although a few stretch up to eight or so low-power strikes).  Like DOA, though, linking attacks is generally determined by the canned strings or by staggering your opponent (which works more or less as in DOA2).  There's a little less emphasis on developing original combos, although you can still devise some very clever linked attacks by studying how the stagger system works and what effect the walled arenas have on combat.   It's the defensive system rather than the offensive system that feels a little less deep than some.  Bloody Roar 3 includes a simple, easy-to-use sidestepping system, with up and down mapped to the lower shoulder buttons, but it's not the equal of the reversal scheme in DOA or the complex parry/reversal/sidestep system that Tekken's evolved over the years (you haven't seen real fighting sausagedom until you've seen someone chicken an attack in Tekken Tag).  Defense in fighters has evolved a lot in recent years, and Bloody Roar 3 definitely feels a bit behind the curve.    Graphics  But dang, it looks pretty sometimes.  Bloody Roar 3 at its best features some superb high-speed animation and creative use of the PS2's lighting capabilities -- like DOA2, the stages use multiple light sources to add a visual richness that limits on texture memory might otherwise preclude.  The stage architecture is a mixed bag as far as looks and design go -- some of them are pretty, while others are rather uninspiring -- but the characters are the weirdly-designed equals of the competition in Tekken Tag Tournament.  The reworked character designs are cheerfully bizarre, from the relatively subdued Shina (as per usual, Marvel's been renamed), to Xion and Stun's hulking beast forms.  Everyone has a selection of three costumes, too, including a few highly questionable DOA-esque outfits for the ladies.   The animation is smooth on the whole, especially for the more complex beast forms, but the Beast Drive attacks are where things get genuinely ridiculous.  Yes, they look the same every time, but they're definitely worth seeing them far more than once -- the sequences of attacks move ridiculously fast, but they're all carefully linked together and set off with special effects.  For me, at least, it's fun to recall my old King of Fighters roots, in a 3D game that's not afraid to bring a little of that Eight Maidens flavor to its special attack system.   Sound  Anthony, we've found some competition for the glorious sounds of Yu Suzuki -- yes, Bloody Roar 3 enters the ring to the brilliant strains of violent butt-rock.  sanodg and the rest of the vaunted Namco sound team can back the hell off, because none of Tekken's admittedly brilliant electronica can compare to the thunderous guitars and trip-hammer beat of Bloody Roar's most exciting moments.  All that is left is the final showdown: Bloody Roar butt-rock...versus...BOMB FACTORY~!  WHO WILL BE CHAMPION?   This is a battle for another day.  Moving onward, Activision has replaced a scattered selection of the voices in the game, which were originally in a mix of languages.  The clips that were in English remain as they were, meaning Shenlong sounds as bizarre as he did in the Japanese version, and some of the Japanese has been replaced, meaning Alice doesn't sound half as cute as before (well, depending on how your tastes run, I suppose).  Heavy sigh.But hey, she's still pretty darn cute.  The curious bunny fetish permeating Japanese pop culture has produced some appalling horrors over the years, but this particular specimen ain't bad.Adapt that idea to describe Bloody Roar 3 as a whole.  Where it fails as a fighting game (which is not to call it a failure in any general sense -- it's definitely a well-made fighter), it bounces back on the strength of its personality and unique visual presentation.  It may not necessarily be something equivalent to the competition, but it presents something different, which is a solid alternative route to success.The fighting cognoscenti may scoff at various bits of questionable gameplay here and there, then, but the rest of us can just snicker and fire off another Beast Drive.  Give it a rental at least, and don't be surprised if you come back for more.", "date": "Jun 26, 2001"}
