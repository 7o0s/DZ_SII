Secret Police.  The game could have been much, much better than what was inevitably thrown on a cartridge and shipped this month. Features:  Fast-paced racing game Three modes of play Five cars 10 stages Two player via Link Cable For Game Boy and Game Boy Color   Chase H.Q. Secret Police is a portable conversion of the Taito arcade game that was released about a decade ago. In it, you play a team of undercover cops out to nail suspects on the highway. Disable their vehicles by nailing them with a hearty bump of your fender, or hit 'em from a distance with your gun. Hurt him enough and he won't be able to do much but surrender.  The handheld version's been tailored a bit more for the console market -- instead of just going balls-out on the highway after your suspect, you actually have to first track him down in the overhead map. Here, you choose three team members, each with his or her own special abilites (from speed to power to better car handling), and plop them down in different locations of the city. The challenge is to tell them where to go on this map to trap the suspect -- once he's been intercepted on the map, it's up to that one vehicle to take him out of commission in the behind-the-car perspective. But, there are many routes the suspect can take that will let him get away. If he gets to one of the maps exits, then your game is over. In all honesty, this overhead map portion is the best part of the game.  The arcade version was all about weaving between mobs of slow moving traffic to get to your suspect. The Game Boy version is somewhat like that, but not exactly -- to make life difficult on the highway, the game just gives you tighter turns and rocks in the middle of the road, with the occasional slow car to get in your way. The driving portion is rather boring, especially in the later levels when the suspect's car has superhuman abilities and you have to pull off perfect driving skills just to catch up with him.  Graphically, the game moves at a pretty good pace. I hate the fact that the camera shifts over to the side in a tight curve so you can't see what's two pixels in front of your face. It's a dirty trick to make the game harder to play. And don't get me started on audio -- I literally had to get to the medicine cabinet for an aspirin after having to listen to the high-pitched squeals in the music for far too long. I was really looking forward to Chase H.Q. Secret Police, especially after blowing a few bucks in quarters on the arcade machines about 10 years ago. The Game Boy Color version is just flat-out dull, and I'll never play this game again after this review goes up on IGNpocket.", "date": "Oct 1, 1999"}
