This year's iteration puts you in control of one of 33 different recognizable automobiles, and it's up to you to pilot to the finish line by learning how the pros do it.  Something of note about NASCAR, if this style of racing isn't your bag, then you won't like it. For EA, it's big money, and for those who love it, NASCAR 2000 is a solid representative of the sport. As for the rest of the planet, this game may not be of interest to you; it's not your average racing game. Gameplay  It's not devilishly fast, it's not wickedly furious, and it's not amazingly fun, but you've got to admit, it's got different ways to play. Included is a Single Race Mode, which is home to regular racing, head-to-head action with a buddy, driver creation, and more. The main meat and potatoes of the game, the Championship Season, is where the action is. Here you get to pick your team, car, and race through the season by learning the tracks in and out, how to manage your time and the car itself.   But it's the two-player mode that is one of the most entertaining aspects of the game. Especially if you decide not to follow the normal race and instead have a ~collision contest~ with a friend.  Hey, nothing beats slamming into a chum with a car that's got M&Ms painted all over it, right? Well, OK, even NASCAR fanatics will enjoy hat creative aspect of the game. Here, you get to detail out your car, pick from several courses, and got head to head for serious competition. Even though I'm not a huge NASCAR fan, this was a blast with a friend. Here is the big list of courses, which are all official NASCAR tracks: Atlanta, California, Charlotte, Bristol, Darlington, Homestead, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Martinsville, Michigan, North Carolina, Phoenix, Pocono, Richmond, Sears Point, Talledega, Texas and Watkins Glen.   NASCAR's controls, though, are fitting for a game of its type. Players are sat behind the wheel and can get started without any problems. It's easy enough to get started, but it takes a little longer to truly becomean expert. The car physics are adequate and the responsiveness is solid, too. And, for those who love peripherals, you're not in a tremendous amount of love, because NASCAR 2000 is compatible with one of several different kinds of steering wheel controllers. Also, after you circle a track several times, it's probably time for you to head off to the pit stops for all of your automobile needs.  Do you require fuel, tires, or something else?  Pop on in, and you'll be set for awhile.  After your car has all that it needs, it's time to hit the road and reclaim your position once more.   This update has improvements over last year's debut, there's no reason for fans to be uninterested, especially since it's packed with drivers, cars, and locations that should practically be common knowledge.  EA packed the game with 18 real tracks (with five new road tracks), plus five new fantasy courses, better computer AI, for more hard-core racing down the stretch, and 33 drivers as well as rookies. EA also has dug into history a little, adding several legendary racers. Still, you've got to love NASCAR racing to enjoy this game, If you couldn't care less about who ~John Andretti~ is, or what it's like to race in a car sponsored by ~Goodwrench Service Plus~, it's highly suggested that you steer out of NASCAR 2000's path and speed away.   Thirty three active drivers and cars were updated for the 1999 season. These racers include Jeff Gordon, Dale Earnhardt, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Mark Martin, Dale Jarrett, Terry Labonte, Bobby Labonte, Jeff Burton, Jeremy Mayfield, Rusty Wallace, John Andretti, Kyle Petty, Adam Petty, Mike Skinner, Tony Stewart, Ernie Irvan, Kenny Irwin Jr., Kenny Wallace, Johnny Benson, Ken Schrader, Ricky Rudd, Darrell Waltrip, Michael Waltrip, Bill Elliott, Sterling Marlin, Bobby Hamilton, Ward Burton, Steve Park, Geoffrey Bodine, Wally Dallenbach, Chad Little, Kevin Lepage and Joe Nemechek. Graphics If the shoe fits, wear it. Graphically speaking, NASCAR 2000's shoes fit well, at least when speaking about the car models and menus. Everything has a recognizable appearance and will easily stick out if you're familiar to the NASCAR scene.  Of course, it doesn't matter whether or not you really are gung-ho on the whole deal, because there's a distinguished look for everything. The tracks, however, are a bit less detailed and beg for a shot of flavor.  While the ~Fantasy Road Courses~ boast a better look than the normal tracks, most appear drab and barren, and if your attention span allows you to race for a few dozen laps, it won't take long to realize how lacking some courses truly are. Electronic Arts Sports did, however, manage to pull the game off with a steady framerate in high resolution.  The cars and backgrounds look sharper and more detailed, but at a cost, it seems. There is noticeable draw-in, and the graphics don't exactly manage to be pushed anything up to the level of ~excellent.~ Like most other games of its kind, NASCAR 2000 includes a ~Replay Mode,~ which gives off the highlights of the race in a TV-style manner. Aside from the visual appearance during gameplay itself, things outside sport a nicer look.  Menus shine with NASCAR-icity and will make following devotees feel right at home.  Sound While the music is run of the mill, the sound effects and voice commentary are what make its audio bearable. The exclusive TV-style commentary by Benny Parsons and broadcast legend Bob Jenkins does add color and interest when the driving itself gets a little...repetitive. As for the sound effects, the normal ~Vroooooo-vra-vroooooooooooom~ fits the picture, and screeches, crashes, and peel-outs aplenty have sound effects that complement what happens. Even with all of these, most every noise is swallowed by the extreme volume of your car's engine as you speed your way along, including spoken comments, making things other than your own vehicle difficult to hear. us awake.NASCAR 2000 is nothing more than average to gamers whose interests lie in different racing styles. I found myself bored as I played through its many courses since there is a serious lack of variety, one which ultimately decides whether it was indeed enjoyable or not.  That's not to say this game is bad. In fact, as far as an update goes, it's an excellent one. This year's version has a lot of extras last year's didn't, and it shows in the overall feel and several different modes available for fans of the genre. However, my favorite types of racers have loads of diverse tracks, great interactivity, and a healthy amount of options, and in comparison to a few other of my favorites, NASCAR 2000 really didn't have much to quench my thirst.  My idea of ~fun~ isn't circling the same track over and over and over again, after all! However, love-swayed zealots who are enthused about NASCAR will gobble it up, no fork, knife, or bib required.  But for me and many others, there's just not enough to impress, let alone keep", "date": "Oct 30, 1999"}
