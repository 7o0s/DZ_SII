I had never considered that if that was ever to take place, I would have to travel to only dark and inhospitable planets with a bunch of malcontent lazyasses. Space Colony from Firefly, the makers of Stronghold, throws that proposition at potential gamers. There are some quirky and fun gaming moments to be had along with fairly good strategic decision making opportunities. But unfortunately, interface annoyances, lackluster graphics, and characters that should have been fun to interact with mix in to create a  game that was almost great, but will remain average in my mind instead.   The Idea   Take one part The Sims, one part Startopia, and a pinch of combat strategy and you'll have Space Colony. The general idea of the game is to be able to build a profitable colony on a distant planet while managing the ~strong personalities~ that each of the colonists bring with them.    You will take the role of an overseer for Blackwater Industries. They're shameless profit mongers and could care less about your personal sanity as long as whatever insane job they assign to you and your crew gets finished. Throughout the game, during announcements from the company and in mission briefings, you'll hear get an earful of their clever company slogans such as ~We put profit first!~ At least they're honest, yes?   The humor in the game runs along these lines and is pretty entertaining for the most part. Your colonists will all have their own catchphrases and lines of dialogue for all of the functions available to them in the game. There aren't a ton of them, so you'll start to hear repeats shortly, but they're done well for what they are. When the big Norwegian biker starts talking to himself, you can't help but give a chuckle.     Over the course of the game, you'll have to interact and use several different colonists to keep your new colony clean, healthy, safe, and operational. Missions are broken up into several general types. You'll be charged with setting up and running mining installations, tourist traps, and directing military actions against hostile alien life and competitors. Most of the difficult missions will have you completing a bit of each. Bring in intelligent alien life and you've got some real problems sometimes. It's pretty hard to beat some of these missions on the first try. The computer can be ruthless with its attacks and if you don't place defenses in the correct positions, your money supply will dwindle quickly and your base will be destroyed.   In any case, there are plenty of scenarios to keep you engaged. You'll have the campaign, which actually follows a path of rising difficulty (which can be pretty difficult), the Galaxy mode, which will allow you to pick individual scenarios with ranging difficulty levels, as well as a sandbox mode with several types of planets to suit every player's needs. Add a level designer onto this, and there's plenty of play to be found here. The question is just whether you'll want to keep playing it or not.   The Colonists   The personality of the game rides all on... well, personalities. Each of the colonists that's supplied to you will have some sort of personality disorder to drive you nuts. Some, such as the main character Venus will give you little to no problems (unless they've been probed by a floating alien brain), while others like egomaniac Greg, will give you nothing but problems. Each of the colonists have needs, some of which will be more important to them than others. Stig needs to eat, Greg needs to talk, Mr. Zhang needs to sleep, and so on. If their needs aren't satisfied, they'll get angry and they're work shift will diminish. A lot of the equipment that you place into the game will require one of these colonists to operate it. So really, your success depends on keeping your colonists happy. And they can be a bunch of little whiners.   Generally, none of your colonists will take care of their own needs unless they get to a critical point, and sometimes even then, they won't take care of them, at which point they'll go insane and you'll have to either send them to the robot psychiatrist or throw them in the brig. This can be pretty aggravating as you'll sometimes find your colonists sitting around doing nothing when they're out of their work shift. They could easily be filling up their needs instead of sitting around. Why they don't take care of this stuff I don't know. Even the wackos I know in real life will make sure to have some fun, eat, or take a nap when not at work. What's even more frustrating is that very few of your colonists will stop and talk to each other when not at work, which means friendship ratings will drop quickly (way too quickly) and the next time two individuals stop to speak, they'll just shout insults at each other. This not only makes relationships worse (to the point that colonists will knock each other out) but it also drops the relationship need down all the way, meaning you'll have to hold their hands even more.   Perhaps it was just that the game felt too much like a babysitting simulation at times. While I didn't mind micro managing the colonists some of the time, it seemed like that was all I was doing. Why couldn't they have gotten some relationship points when sitting down at the same table with someone while eating? It makes sense. People talk when they're at the table with someone else. Why were there no relationship points given when colonists were doing activities together such as dancing? Yes, there are special commands to get colonists to specifically go and do things like dance and sit in the hot tub together. But why not when they just happen to be sitting together? Actually getting two people together to talk can be a pain in the ass as well as every character on the team, aside from Slim and his skateboard, are slow as constipation. But I suppose what really baffles me is that I thought people would have gone crazy because they couldn't have gotten away from one another, not because they couldn't find anybody to talk to.   Even more frustrating is that when colonists are in their shift and the job runs out of things to do, one of two things will happen. The first is that they'll just get up and wander off to do nothing (if they don't have a secondary job) instead of just sitting down and waiting at their post for more work to come up. The second is that they'll continue to sit at their post even though they have a second job that needs doing more.    Finally, in missions that require some military presence of colonists (the manned lasers), they'll just get up in the middle of an attack and wander back to the base because they need to hit the dance floor! Nevermind the rampaging aliens destroying the base and the last ditch effort at survival. Being entertained is more important than living! When you aren't paying attention, this can be disastrous to your base. Some aliens are incredibly powerful and will destroy your defenses and some important structures in seconds.   I know these personalities were supposed to be quirky and damaged, but they're too much. I spent most of my time just being frustrated by these characters and their total lack of direction and motivation instead of having fun. If objectives weren't so stringent and dire as they were in some cases,  I might have had more fun spending time diddling with the colonists and had more fun with that. It wouldn't have hurt to have some more unique interactions between colonists either. Interactions (aside from some more chuckle worthy dialogue) are pretty bland.   The Base   The base comes with a control room, where power, oxygen, and medical supplies are maintained, and some warehouses. From there, you'll have to add on new biodomes and objects to keep your colonists happy. Unfortunately, this is where the game starts getting annoying to me. This is unfortunate because this is pretty much just the beginning. All new rooms that are added onto your base will have to be constructed in small, medium and large format. All of these new rooms are square. Their shapes and sizes can't be fiddled with. This leaves you with some pretty limited planning options. I would much rather have had some different options as my bases would tend to get disorganized and confused.     Placing structures inside the base is fairly plain. Once you have the money you can select and place anything from a combat ring to a relaxation pod. Each of the colonists has likes and dislikes when it comes to entertainment so placing a good mix is key. The variety of these items is actually pretty good and made me wish that they had been a bit more interesting. Along with those are necessities such as mess halls, medical bays, showers, and so on. All of these structures are fairly small and uninteresting and can't be rotated at all to create any visual interest. Your view of the game will be stuck at one angle in isometric view as well creating pretty uninteresting environment to play in.   Outside the base, you'll have to place various industry buildings, such as mining stations and robot construction bays. Again, these could have benefitted greatly with a rotate placement function as they tend to be long with the useful side at one end. Being able to rotate so that the section with the actual mining robot would face the way you want would have made things much better.   Military Action   When you're assigned to a planet, it might be totally devoid of pests and hostile life, but chances are it's not. Therefore, you'll need some military might in order to get your job done. There are several different options here. You can go with automatic weapons like the auto-firing laser turrets as well as energy shields for both ground assaults and meteorites falling from the sky. These items pretty much take care of themselves, which is nice. Manual lasers are more powerful than the auto-lasers, but as I said before, you'll have to depend on some colonists that are generally not dependable.   If you're looking to go on the offensive, whether that be to take out an alien mother or mix it up with a rival alien mining firm, you'll have to build some robots. You'll need actual materials to create these robots in a facility (you can't just purchase them like you can purchase structures), but once they're done, you'll be able to command them to go wherever you wish. Just be careful where you send them because the pathfinding can be bad for their health. These robots will always get where they're going, but don't really care if they walk over damaging lava fields to get there. Even when there is a clear path that would lead these units past lava to their destination, they'll still walk through it. This actually applies to your colonists as well. If there aren't enough hover bikes to take all of your colonists to and from work, there's a chance one will get off his or her shift and walk back to the base... right through a pit of lava.   These controlled military units are not the easiest beasts to direct in action and generally tend to be slower than anything else out on the planet. Regardless, military planning does add a bit more tension and interest to the experience.   The Graphics   I'm generally a fan of isometric artistic games. Titles like Commandos 3 and SimCity 4 prove that engines don't have to be fully 3D or have a billion polygons to look good. But while Space Colony has some cute objects and interesting design, it lacks the punch that these other titles bring. Industry structures are the best thing in the game. They all have moving parts and add a lot of interest and color. However, items that you place inside the bases are fairly stale by comparison.   All of the objects found in the game are animated rather poorly as well. Objects move chunkily around the screen losing all fluidity and sense of realism. If you're going to do a game in 2D nowadays, it really should be well animated, full of life and color, and have plenty of variety.   The most annoying thing about the graphics isn't the look. It's the functionality. There are some big structures in this game, and if you happen to stick one in front of your base and your view, it's going to be a trick to see around them. They go translucent so that you'll have some chance of seeing what's going on behind them, but some of the time, you won't be able to select any of the hidden structures, which leaves you depending on your stubborn colonists to use the items there themselves. Good luck to that. This should have been thought through a little bit more since they were obviously stuck on having a fixed camera.Space Colony was a game that I wanted to love but just ended up not finding fun for all of the reasons outlined above. While I like character interaction, psychology, and humor, I don't like having to babysit psychotic and incurably incompetent characters. Sending one of them to their deaths every now and again was more fun than keeping them alive. Too bad they get reanimated back on the orbiting mothership.This game is so close to being something that I would recommend. It just missed out on some of the ease of use that Startopia and The Sims had as well as the visual personality of either of those.", "date": "Oct 21, 2003"}
