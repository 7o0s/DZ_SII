Set in the desert land of Elona, the third entry after Prophecies and Factions offers two more character classes, plenty of new story and missions, a new player versus player (PvP) mode, lots of new items and methods of modification, and NPC Heroes. While the focus of the game is still centered on competitive PvP combat and grouping with others for cooperative missions, the Heroes function to make Nightfall a more appealing title for gamers looking for a solo experience. If you have yet to dive into the world of Guild Wars, Nightfall is the best point of entry.   Nightfall's overall design remains the same as before. Players interact, chat, and form parties in the various towns, then enter an instanced area when embarking on missions or secondary quests. Only you and your party exist in the world outside towns, so there's no need to worry about getting ganked by high level opposing players or anything of that nature. Players get the opportunity to hack at each other in a separate mode, appropriately titled PvP. When starting a game, you'll create a character and enter them into the role-playing (RP) or PvP portion of the game. In PvP your selected combatant automatically starts at 20 but will have limited options for customization. You're better off starting up an RP character and leveling them to the level cap of 20, since along the way you're bound to unlock items you can use to customize your PvP avatar. Any RP character you've bumped to 20, which depending on how much you play can be accomplished in a week or less, can be imported to the PvP portion of the game (just click the little ship on the world map), so there's no need to worry about all that RP time investment going to waste.    Though the core gameplay remains the same in Nightfall, plenty of frills have been tacked on. Heroes are the most prominent new feature. As you complete primary quests that advance Nightfall's narrative, you'll acquire these permanent NPC party members. They can be switched in and out as you see fit, but they'll always be available to bring along should you need some extra swords or spells. While henchmen can only be hired and directed to attack, Heroes are more controllable and customizable. You can give them new weapons and off hand items, buy new skills and customize their eight slot skill bar, and augment their statistics however you see fit. Up to three Heroes can accompany you at any time and each can be given individual move orders, use specific skills on specific targets, and  told to adhere to three behavioral patterns: Fight, Guard, or Avoid Combat. Their armor auto-levels with them, but can be customized with runes purchased at a vendor or salvaged from identified items.   Before heading out into Elona, you'll now get to select the newly added Dervish and Paragon. Each new class has a specific focus, and they seem fairly effective so far. Dervishes carry around mammoth scythes used to hit multiple adjacent opponents in one swipe. Also in a Dervishes arsenal of skills are various enchantments they can cast on themselves. The enchantment can thereafter be consumed to lend added power or other beneficial effects to scythe attacks, similar to how a Paladin functions in World of Warcraft. In any kind of group battle, the Dervish was a welcome ally, quickly draining multiple health bars with a few spins of the scythe. The Paragon plays much differently, providing consistent damage from afar with their tossed spears and capable of buffing the entire party with various effects. Their buffs, divided into chants and echoes, seemed to be their most powerful aspect if used correctly. Some of the echoes, called refrains, auto-refresh on an ally if they're still active when a chant ends. For players who pay attention, properly combining these for maximum effectiveness will certainly help out during larger and more lasting RP or PvP battles.    Once you finally decide on a character class and set out into RP, there's an all new storyline to play though. If you're actually trying to follow along with the narrative instead of just power level, reading the game manual is recommended. There are quite a few characters and factions involved in how the main plot develops, and it's easy to lose track of who's from where and what their motivations are. To move along the story you'll need to complete primary quests, which link together the game's 20 main missions. Don't let that number deceive you, there is way more to do in the single player campaign than those missions alone. Plenty of secondary quests are available, all of which net you experience and occasionally Sunspear promotion points. On many occasions you'll be prevented from engaging in the main narrative until you've achieved a certain Sunspear rank. So in between primary quests you'll have to do whatever side quests you can or get a Final Fantasy XI-like Signet cast on you that grants promotion points for killing specific monster types.     With the occasional focus on promotion point grinding, getting involved with the actual storyline takes an excessive amount of time. Plenty of plot developments occur on the island starting area, but we reached level 20 before really even engaging Nightfall's narrative meat. Trudging through the somewhat boring opening areas pays off, however, as any Hero you unlock in RP is unlocked for PvP. Without doing this, you'd have to spend faction points received by winning PvP matches to recruit them. It's also worth playing the RP to identify items dropped from mobs. They'll come with specialized inscriptions, weapon components like scythe snathes, shield handles, and axe grips, and augmentation pieces for armor like runes and insignias. All these can be added to your Heroes and main character to power up their abilities and effectiveness in combat with added armor, health, energy, or other special effects. One annoyance we had was only characters created specifically for PvP can access the equipment modding template to add all these special effects. If you bring over your level 20 character from RP, you have to manually apply all the inscriptions, runes, etc. which is inconvenient. Also, there's the issue of being able to infinitely apply the same runes and inscriptions on your PvP-only character and Heroes, whereas the RP runes and inscriptions can be applied to only one item, seemingly lending an advantage to PvP-only characters' equipment.    For the more hardcore crowd, ArenaNet implemented an armor and skill save templates. This way, PvP and RP characters can save their secondary profession, skill setup, and attribute point allotments and thereafter quickly switch between different builds. The same goes for equipment setups, but that only applies to PvP characters. RP characters can, however, customize weapon sets and switch between them with the F1-F4 keys. Though many aspects of equipment and skill management and swapping have been streamlined for Nightfall, the inventory itself could still use an overhaul. As it is, your main character and Heroes all share the same inventory; an inventory that can quickly get cluttered. It's not as big a hassle as something like Neverwinter Nights 2, but you still need to pick through the menu screens, double click a salvage or identification kit, and then click the target item. Any kind of auto-identify, auto-salvage, or auto-sort options would have been greatly appreciated.   For players who couldn't care less about RP, there's a new Hero Battle PvP mode. Nightfall's PvP retains the same progression structure from Factions, where consecutive wins advance you to higher level arenas. Hero Battles are almost instantly available, however, so there's no need to work through Random, Team, Hero's Ascent, and so on to get there. The new Arena provides the closest thing Guild Wars can offer in terms of one on one fights, only you bring along three Heroes. Each map has a main capture point, which can be commandeered by your side by standing on it. Taking the point starts a morale meter moving, which awards you a point every time it fills. Other capture points can be taken that provide different kinds of benefits, even an extra mercenary fighter. Killing opponents is the best way to earn points, best accomplished by focusing your attacks on the enemy healer. It's certainly a welcome addition the PvP arenas, and something that shifts Nightfall's emphasis even more toward solo play.    As with Prophecies and Factions, Nightfall is a beautiful game. Dervishes and Paragon character designs all align with the emo-fantasy styles of the other classes. Elona itself looks great, with sprawling dusty mesas, claustrophobic steamy bogs, and imposing, intricate architectural designs. Some of the monster designs look great too, like the lumbering mesas and stone snakes that will probably make you laugh. After all, how often do you fight a walking land mass? Elona is yet another visually engrossing fantasy world in which to indulge yourself. There's some great sound as well, particularly the symphonic overland music tinged with an appropriately epic feel and some striking ambient sounds. Voice acting could use a lot of work, however, as the awkward, artificial cadences will frequently jolt you back into the real world. Other than that, expect to hear a lot of the audio from the previous two campaigns.If you've never experienced Guild Wars, Nightfall is the place to start. It offers plenty of augmented features to make playing solo more viable, while simultaneously facilitating cooperative play. Grouping with a few players then dropping in Heroes to fill the open slots is far more time efficient than waiting to fill up an entire group with human players. The new Dervish and Paragon classes have some interesting abilities, and are certainly worth checking out for those who've been playing Guild Wars for a while now. The gameplay itself is still largely the same, so don't expect anything drastically new (controllable sandworms excluded) if you're thinking about a purchase. Tweaks to the menus mean the game's easier to navigate, weapon and skill loadouts can be saved, and the Hero Battle mode provides an alternative for PvP players sick of relying on a human controlled team. Despite the fact that Nightfall feels similar to past campaigns, it's difficult not to recommend a game that's still so much fun to play. Oh, and if you didn't know, Guild Wars has no subscription fee.", "date": "Nov 9, 2006"}
