Scooby Doo has made one impressive comeback in the last few years.  The cult classic cartoon is now a mulit-million-dollar franchise, spawning toys and games, awful movies, and a new animated series on Cartoon Network.  And now ol' Scoob and the gang are searching for clues in your pocket, thanks to Digital Bridges' new Doo cellphone game.  But does this go-go adventure manage to turn your cell into a Mystery Machine, or is it as palatable as Fred's bright orange kravat? Features: Adventure-style game play Two mysteries to be solved Play as Scooby, Shaggy, or Velma Scooby Doo's visuals may not necessarily blow your ascot back, but don't let their simplicity fool you, because Jeepers Creepers has a surprising amount of depth for a first-gen cellphone game.  Scooby Doo presents two different mysteries for amateur sleuths to solve, and to do so, you must physically collect clues, evaluate evidence, pilot the Mystery Machine away from trouble, and finally point the finger at the guilty party.  The first stage of the adventure puts you in Shaggy's bellbottoms, as he wanders a spooky old house or abandoned mineshaft, searching for clues on the ground.  These locations are not simple side-scrolling levels, but mapped out lairs that require backtracking, finding shortcuts, and plain old guesswork.  And Shaggy ain't alone.  Ghosts and ghouls wander passages, hoping to scare the pants off Shaggy.  Fortunately, the ever-hungry goof is able to hide from these bad guys by slipping behind clocks and other fixtures.  The clues aren't just laying in the wide open, either.  Shaggy is going to to have search urns, bookcases, and whatnot to uncover all three clues.  Some fixtures reveal hidden passages, too.  Then it's up to Velma to review the clues Shaggy found.  First, you look at the four suspects' mug shots, memorizing details like height, weight, hair, etc.  Then, it's time to see what the clues say.  Shaggy had the opportunity to find three clues, but if he got scared away before finding all three, you'll have to try to solve the mystery with less evidence.  Using these collected factoids, you must identify the perp, but this time, you can no longer see the pictures.  You must ID the guilty by name alone.  Then it's time to lure the ghost into a trap.  How else, but by piloting the Mystery Mobile or a mine cart?  Plenty of obstacles are in your way, like massive potholes and rolling logs, so you have to steer around or jump over them.  Should the ghost catch up with you before reaching the trap, game over.  If you reach the trap, the pursuing ghost will be captured, and it's time for the unveiling.  Hopefully, Velma got it right.  Considering that most cellphone games are one-screen affairs, it's amazing how Digital Bridges was able to successfully pull off a somewhat ambitious design like the multi-leveled Scooby Doo.  Platforming, driving, memorizing--not bad for an itty-bitty game.  And none of the sequences suffer for the benefit of the others; each was obviously designed with the same level of care.  Now, back to those graphics.  Shaggy and Scoob look as rudimentary as can be, but they get the job done.  The mansion and mine are cleverly designed, with different fixtures decorating the passages.  The Mystery Machine and mine cart chases are handled fairly well, too.  No blurring here, but the control is a little irritating as it seems like the jumping doesn't react as fast as you'd like it to.  Unfortunately, there is no soundtrack, not even a snippet of the show's famous theme when the game starts up.Scooby Doo: Jeepers Creepers is surprisingly engaging for a simple cellphone game.  The multiple gameplay styles are well done, each one feeding into another to create a complete, cohesive adventure.  I'll be honest, I'm not much of a Scooby Doo fan, but I enjoyed this little game not just because of what it tried to do, but on how well it delivered.", "date": "Apr 28, 2003"}
