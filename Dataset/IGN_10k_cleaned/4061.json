Along the way, they've learned what works and what doesn't, what gets old fast, what needs to be done to keep a game fresh, and more. So it's important to have a long pedigree, since there are so many pitfalls you have to avoid. Unfortunately, No Man's Land makes a few mistakes here and there.   NML is set in American Colonial times, and the single player aspect consists of three campaigns involving the Spaniards, English, Navajo Indians, and others. The multi-mission tutorial will start you off with the Navajo, who are already deep in deadly conflict with the colonists. All the usual RTS suspects are here: gather resources (wood, gold and food) with peasants, build increasingly complex and expensive structures, and improve units and resource gathering through research. All well and good so far. No Man's Land gets the basics down just fine.   However, where it innovates, it does so with decidedly mixed results. You'll have several battle formations to choose from, but it's near-impossible to keep your units organized, in practice. Sometimes they will also ignore your repeated commands to attack a certain structure or unit if set to their maximum aggression level. But if you set them to Defensive, they will often stand stock-still when under the attack of a ranged unit.   Unfortunately, there's no happy medium. In fact, it's so difficult to control a large group that sometimes I just had to watch them spread out and choose their targets, letting the chips fall where they may. They do a decent enough job, but I could have kept more of them alive if they'd been more responsive to my commands. The Offensive mode is just a little too independent.    Thankfully, there are several things you can do to make you units last longer. For example, once you've built a Navajo tannery (or a English smithy) you can research better weapons and armor. Building a Navajo shaman hut gives your units the ability to heal over time as well. Also, your units gain experience, and gain modest improvements to their maximum health. Unfortunately, only the hero units last long enough to gain useful benefits from this feature.   Hero units are identified by a spiked circle instead of a smooth one. They have many times over the health points of a grunt, heal faster, and sometimes hit pretty hard and move quickly. They will truly take a beating, but if one of them dies, your mission almost always fails immediately. In the thick of battle it's difficult to keep track of them, though, because enemy ranged units can be devilishly difficult to spot among the buildings and trees. You can set the game to show all hidden units (except for those who have invisibility as a skill), but ranged units will generally stay locked on one distant target even if they have a dozen soldiers right in their faces.   This goes for your ranged units as well. Since formations are extremely difficult to maintain, the bowmen and riflemen might as well be kamikazes. And since they do relatively little damage and don't often come in handy for targeting certain units, they won't be very useful, except for those flaming arrows, which are great against buildings. Yet even here, there's a drawback. Colonial guard towers do a punishing amount of damage. They can only attack one unit at a time, but get two or three in close proximity, and things get real ugly for your ground units.   No Man's Land fares significantly better on the water--it's too bad there weren't more naval missions. Without the troubles of dealing with messy formations and disobedient units going off into suicide missions, things go much more smoothly. Plus, the warships pack a serious, satisfying wallop. One volley can take out several ground units and send a spray of earth high into the sky. Your ship-building dock can also research improvements for speed and damage. A single warship can really lay into a town, as long as you keep a sharp eye out for cannons, which have a large bonus against naval units. A few shots from those, and you're toast.     Unfortunately, as with the ground units, if the enemy's attack range goes farther than your unit's Defensive Mode awareness, your unit will sit there and die. Altogether too much babysitting, then a correspondingly ironic lack of control when the heat gets turned up.   They've some pretty good work with the other elements, however. The music is actually pretty cool, with each faction getting its own theme song performed with instruments specific to their culture. You'll also get environmental sound, with the wind sighing through the trees, the sound of chopping wood, waves lapping the shore, and the buzz of wildlife. Graphics are quite colorful without being cartoonish, but both naval and ground units are decidedly blocky. Fire and smoke are pretty realistic, with buildings looking increasingly worse as they become more damaged. The actual destruction animation is a little cheesy, though--the entire structure just kind of turns black and sinks into the map. Dead bodies sink into the map as well, which is kind of odd-looking. It might have been better to have them fade away.    And the enemy bodies will pile up, at least on the default difficulty. Some missions will have you running a hero or two from point A to point B, picking up allies along the way, instead of the rote schedule of build, gather, train, collect, etc. The extra units usually consist of small villages under attack. When you come across these villages, you will immediately be able to control the inhabitants, adding them to your army. On standard difficulty, I had a throng by the end of most missions when my hero units were melee fighters. But ranged-attack heroes don't seem to do much damage, and take a lot of damage because they don't take evasive action or switch to a close combat weapon.   Multiplayer, of course, offers some more interesting challenges, and there's plenty of variety here: Deathmatch with alliances, King of the Hill (being the first to reach a central flag), CTF, Eliminate Elite Unit, and a couple modes involving railroads. Build/Destroy Railroad is pretty straightforward: one side tries to build a railroad, the other side tries to prevent them. Alternatively, you can do Railroad Competition, where one player tries to be the first to build his or her railroad from point A to point B. All Internet play is done through an integrated Gamespy client, for up to eight players, and can also be done over a LAN.  Age of Mythology and Command and Conquer: Generals are casting a long shadow over the genre right now with their recent expansion packs. As such, there's no compelling reason to pick No Man's Land over the other two choices, unless it was at a budget price. But at $39.99 MSRP, it just doesn't offer comparable content. The mechanics feel a bit stale and it's just too frustrating trying to keep your units together. There also doesn't seem to be much historical accuracy throughout the game, which is unusual for a period strategy game.", "date": "Oct 24, 2003"}
