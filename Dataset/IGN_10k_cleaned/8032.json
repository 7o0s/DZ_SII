We got our hands on a couple of new Head Games titles a few days ago and we played them until we threw-up, which was about twenty minutes total.  Some of you may remember Head Games as the publishers of such titles as Big Game Hunter, Extreme Paintbrawl and Extreme Tennis.  Now these titles haven't been the most well received by the editors here at IGNPC, but they have all garnered rather memorable reviews.  Well, for some reason Head Games didn't send us either extreme rodeo or extreme bullrider, so when we saw these puppies at our local EB we just couldn't resist picking them up.  ~So what separates an extreme rodeo from a regular rodeo?,~ you may be asking yourself.  ~Are the bulls doused in gasoline and set ablaze before the shoot opens?  Do the cowboys put rattlesnakes in their pants before the big calf roping competition?  Are the rodeo clowns outfitted with rocket-powered rollerblades and big sticks?~  Well, the answer to that question doesn't seem to be very easy.  Head Games has a long history of applying the ~extreme~ moniker to anything and everything, even though none of the extremeness ever seems to bleed through.  If Head Games were in the food processing industry, they'd probably have a product called Extreme White Bread.  Well, the same seems to hold true for extreme rodeo.  Except for the fact that the game's title is printed in lower-case letters, there's absolutely nothing extreme about it.  As a matter of fact, it's pretty damn boring and tame for a rodeo simulation.  The action (or lack thereof) in Extreme Rodeo is split into six different events.  You can choose to compete in bull riding, saddle bronc, bareback, calf roping, barrel racing and bull poker.  Most of these events are self-explanatory.  The first three involve little more than wiggling your mouse to stay on your mount and clicking the button occasionally to spur the animal into a frenzy, thereby guaranteeing you more points.  In the calf roping event you'll chase a baby cow through the arena, hopefully lasso it and wrestle it to the ground in what looks like an incredibly painful and horrifying experience for the poor little thing.  And barrel racing is exactly what it sounds like ... you race around some barrels.  Yeehaw, now that's extreme.     Out of all of the events in extreme rodeo, bull poker is certainly the most deserving of the ~extreme~ tag.  Ever seen that picture of the dogs playing poker?  Funny, ain't it?  Well, bull poker has nothing to do with that so I don't even know why I brought it up.  In bull poker you become a maddened bull whose sole purpose in life is to hurl rodeo cowboys into the air with your horns.  OK ... I admit that's pretty extreme.  It's still not fun, but it is extreme.     As if the playability in extreme Rodeo Wasn't bad enough, the graphics are just plain laughable.  Although the game is supposedly enhanced with a 3D accelerator, you'll wonder if your circa 1985 C64 is somehow mistakenly attached to your monitor when this one loads up.  All of the animals and riders are incredibly stiff and blocky, and the backgrounds actually tilt up from some camera angles, giving the appearance of riding in front of a huge green and brown drop cloth.  And the game physics are remarkably poor.  For example, in bull poker the bull can't even move backwards.  You know ... just like in real life.   After playing a few rounds of Extreme Rodeo, I went into the options menu to make sure I hadn't switched off the 'Fun' option.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find it. In all seriousness though, avoid this game.  If you're a rodeo fan and think this is the game for you, you're wrong.  If you find this one in the bargain bin, don't even waste five dollars on it.  Remember, you've been forewarned!  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "May 5, 1999"}
