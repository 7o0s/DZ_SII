Since then, the team's been hard at work duplicating that gaming success by continuing one of the company's properties it brought to life on the Sega Saturn: Guardian Heroes, a fantasy action game that pushed the Double Dragon-style of gameplay into new and exciting directions. The follow-up, entitled Advance Guardian Heroes, brings back the original Saturn game's style of gameplay, but its unbelievably irritating technical problems and underwhelming art style doesn't bring back the magic fans might be expecting. Features 20 playable characters Co-op mode Vs. Mode Cartridge save (one slot) Link cable support for four players  After the critical praise the development team received for its action game based upon the Astro Boy property, Ubi Soft was definitely thinking clearly when it signed the publishing deal for Treasure's next GBA project. An ambitious follow-up to the fan favorite, Guardian Heroes? Sign it on up! The end result, unfortunately, isn't nearly as exciting as the idea is on paper, and ultimately, while the game definitely has some fun game design ideas and play modes, it's hard to overlook just how overwhelmingly sloppy the product is.  Guardian Heroes may seem like an RPG on the surface. Realistically, though, the game's all action. It's Treasure's take on the ~brawler~ genre, a style of gameplay popularized by titles such as Double Dragon and Final Fight. The RPG elements come into play when collecting gems; at the end of each Episode, players can (and should) convert these collected gems into character attributes that make them much more powerful in battle.  At the beginning of the game, players have a choice between three different characters of specific abilities, and once that player's selected, that's the one that's taken through to the end. With only one save slot, players can't have multiple games going with different characters, and that limits the appeal of discovering what one character does over another -- to do this, you'll have to erase the game in progress and start anew. Some might find that this encourages multiple plays through. I just find it irritating that Treasure couldn't find a way to squeeze in multiple save blocks in SRAM.  The Treasure style definitely comes through in the gameplay, and the influence shines even stronger if you've played through Astro Boy: Omega Factor. The game is all about stringing combos together and sending enemies flying into other enemies for even more damage. It's a very satisfying direction for the brawler genre, since it allows for creative flair...players can choose many different ways of taking out the enemy. This combat gameplay does tend to get repetitive in places, which is why it's a good thing that the game saves player's progress after each key level battle.  There's also heavy focus on counterattacking, so much so that if players can't get this technique down pat there's no hope for them deeper in the game.  See, when an enemy attacks, players must learn the art of ~blocking~ at the exact moment the attack makes contact. Done right, the attacking character will be stunned for a few seconds, leaving him open for a flurry of attacks. This sort of mechanic works when one or two characters are on the offensive...but when you find yourself being attacked on all sides by five or six characters at once it's best to just move to a safer part of the screen. Or, at the very least, hammer down some attacks that'll clear the screen of the assaulters.     The action is certainly promising, and in a handful of places its a very enjoyable GBA experience. But then, the problem...and it's a doozy: just like Astro Boy: Omega Factor before it, Advance Guardian Heroes has a habit of slowing down during the action when the screen gets a little too cluttered. But where it was ~on occasion~ in Astro Boy, it's more like half of the experience in Advance Guardian Heroes. The slowdown is downright severe in this game, almost to the point where you wonder if the game's defective. It absolutely ruins the timing necessary to pull off the integral counterattacks, so players are left hammering down on the block button hoping that a random button press will trigger it during the bogged-down action. Treasure seemed more concerned throwing as much special effects at the GBA processor on top of tossing in as many as ten on-screen enemies at once; do we really need to see the non-interactive background woosh around like the streets in Outrun when we're being overwhelmed by character attacks from every direction? The game needs a much better balance between ~ooh, neat~ effects and basic level design.  Even though Advance Guardian Heroes uses the namesake of the classic Saturn title, the GBA version, a ~sequel~ of sorts, is really its own game. The namesake is more used for the style of game than it is to reprise past character's roles and situations. In fact, the Game Boy Advance game throws out the Saturn version's confident character and monster style in favor of a more cartoony theme -- the main characters share more in common with a lanky Ichabod Crane than they do a bold, heroic knight. Anyone favoring the Saturn game may be disappointed in the art direction of Advance Guardian Heroes, and if the character poses don't do it, the weak, choppy animation of these guys certainly will.  In its defense, a Game Boy Advance cartridge holds far, far less data than a Saturn CD, and the fact that there are more than 20 controllable characters and even more enemy sprites to store, the amount of animation frames for each being in the game definitely had to be limited.  Like any complete game experience, Advance Guardian Heroes features the expected, extensive storyline that spans several episodes of many levels apiece. But its weak US localization makes it incredibly difficult to figure out what the heck's going on; character dialogue and text feels like the script was given only a single pass through the translation phase, so while sentences have structure, the translators and script writers didn't do a whole lot to clean up the wonkiness of the conversations between characters.  And then there's the ~secondary~ game level designs where players must leap from platform to platform by double-tapping the A button. These challenges are few and far between, but they are definitely there in numbers, which is unfortunate because these are simply out of place and just control far too awkwardly to be any fun.  But despite the sloppiness of Advance Guardian Heroes production value, this GBA title definitely isn't short on options, and its focus on multiplayer gaming is certainly one of its few redeeming features. Two players can go at it in the main storyline in a cooperative mode, and as many as four players can enter a single arena and use their character's abilities in an all-out melee. And when players encounter specific people in the single player battle, defeating them will add those characters to the multiplayer rosters. Just because it's a Treasure game doesn't automatically make it a fantastic gaming experience, and Advance Guardian Heroes proves that the development team isn't this group of infallible game designers. The core design element is certainly sound, and when the action retains its full pace it's actually a lot of fun. But the processor slowdown is downright unbearable in places, and it's far too frequent to be ~acceptable.~ It's rare when the game keeps up to its intended speed, which makes it next to impossible to do specific moves that are important to succeed through the game's levels. The game's story presentation also adds to the sloppy feel of the production, and seems like it was rushed straight through the translation cycle without any brush-up to make the tale coherent. After experiencing the stunning product that is the studio's Astro Boy: Omega Force, it's more than a little disappointing to take a significant step backwards in Advance Guardian Heroes.", "date": "Sep 15, 2004"}
