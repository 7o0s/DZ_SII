{"name": "Jekyll and Hyde", "name_review": "Jekyll & Hyde Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/02/15/jekyll-hyde-review", "text": "comes to us from Dreamcatcher Interactive and Cryo/In Utero and is another action/adventure, emphasis on action.  Based upon the novel by Robert Louis Stephenson, this game takes us into the split personality of Dr. Jekyll and his evil alter ego, Mr. Hyde.  While it has a solid story line, the graphics and simplistic puzzles cause this game to not live up to the standard set by other action/adventure games of today.Four years prior to the start of the game, Dr. Jekylls wife was killed.  After her death, he swore to never again branch into the research of his evil side, Mr. Hyde.  He is raising his daughter alone and heads an insane asylum.  One night, the patients all go crazy and start killing people and destroying things.  Dr. Jekylls daughter is kidnapped by a Mr. Burnwell, a patient that was recently admitted.Dr. Jekyll will do anything to get his daughter back.  After finally catching up with Mr. Burnwell, he reveals that he wants to meet Mr. Hyde.  Dr. Jekyll buried that part of him when his wife died, but now, to save his daughter, he has to once again resurrect the evil Mr. Hyde.  After resurrecting Mr. Hyde and again making his way to Mr. Burnwell, it is revealed that simply meeting Mr. Hyde isnt all that is wanted.  Instead there is a mission that only Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde can complete.  Burnwells strings are being pulled by a mysterious lawyer who admitted Burnwell and demands that Dr. Jekyll retrieve several items for him.  The entire game then follows completing these tasks and, eventually, saving Dr. Jekylls daughter.During the journey, Dr. Jekyll will travel to various locations, from a cemetery with graves that attack to the top of a train where he must avoid electric currents and various enemies.  Periodically, transformation into Mr. Hyde will be required.  This involves combining water with a potion.  Mr. Hyde is stronger and can jump higher and farther, but cannot pick up or hold items.  Switching from Mr. Hyde back into Dr. Jekyll happens without warning, but always when needed, so even that possible challenge is missing.There are no weapons to be found in the game.  Dr. Jekyll attacks with his walking staff and Mr. Hyde uses the brute force of his very large hand.  The monsters are pretty simple for the most part, only requiring one or two shots before becoming immobile.  Some, like the robots, will become stunned when hit, and can be run by.  Boss monsters usually require more hits or alternate means of destroying them, like pushing a master vampire into the light.  All of the enemies lack challenge.  The final boss isnt even a real challenge and the player  doesn't directly attack it to defeat it, which is disappointing.Jekyll & Hyde can be played entirely with the keyboard, although there is an option for using a control pad.  This game, like many action/adventure games, involves a great amount of jumping and combat.  There is an inventory where items, like healing potions and keys, can be stored.  One item can be held by Dr. Jekyll at all times, which means a healing potion can be only a keystroke away.  Controlling the character can be frustrating.  It can only move forward, and to turn and run in the opposite direction, a full one hundred eighty degree turn is required.  Sometimes the player needs to move in an exact direction very quickly and the controls make it incredibly difficult.  Also, there is no quick save feature and the game will only save at specific points in each mission.The camera angle is pretty horrible.  Sometimes, the camera angle cannot be changed and the player has to jump or move in a very awkward fashion.  Other times, the camera angle can be changed, but if not manually changed, will slowly move to a back angle.  Couple this with awkward movement, and this game is very hard to play.The graphics are dated.  During cutscenes, none of the characters move their mouths.  Most of the character models are absurd looking.  Dr. Jekylls daughter is the only character model that is pleasing to the eye.  The locations are very nicely done, but hardly noticeable.  Today, with games setting the mark like Beyond Atlantis II and American McGees Alice, graphics and animation this poor should be a thing of the past.The sound is done pretty well.  Good voice acting is unfortunately overshadowed by the lack of animation when characters are speaking.  Sound effects and background sounds are appropriate.  Unfortunately, if almost nothing else is good about a game, sound cannot save it.Jekyll & Hyde might have been a great action/adventure title several years ago, but today it is far behind the curve.  Poor graphics, horrible animation and the lack of any challenge far outweigh whatever story this game might have.  Playing it through once is rough enough, so I cant imagine anyone ever giving it a second go.  Perhaps if it had a great ending, it would shine a little brighter, but as many other games of this genre seem to ignore the dramatic ending lately, this one is no exception.  There really is no reason to buy this game, unless a person really loves games that are at least four years behind its time.", "date": "Feb 15, 2002"}
