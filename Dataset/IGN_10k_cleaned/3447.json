Nintendo first-party games are easily the best on the system and though Sony releases fewer first-party titles than Nintendo and Microsoft, their first-party fare is generally quite good.  Microsoft, on the other hand, has green-lighted and published such mediocre fare as Kakuto Chojin and Sneakers.  Whoever keeps giving the thumbs up to these projects needs to be slapped and fired.  Microsoft's latest entry into the ~games only a third-party company would put out~ is Kung Fu Chaos.  While KFC isn't a terrible game, it's not one that showcases the power of Xbox and certainly isn't something worthy of a first-party release.    Features Live your dream and become a '70s Kung Fu action star Pick from one of nine action heroes Long single-player mode will eat away the hours Four-player mayhem Custom soundtrack support 5.1 Dolby Digital  Oh, Most Ancient Play of Game Kung Fu Chaos is a four-player fighter in the same vein as Capcom's Powerstone 2 and Infogrames' Loons: The Fight for Fame.  Hong Kong action director Shao Ting is looking to shoot his latest blockbuster film.  You take the role of one of several action stars vying for top billing.  Using sets from other movies (what better way to make a budget title?), players fight one another for the spotlight while the famous Mr. Ting films it all.  You can choose from one of nine characters, each a spoof of an action cliche.  From Pam Grier wannabe Lucy Cannon to ~from every martial arts movie ever made~ Master Sho-Yu.  And, of course, there's a monkey too.  Each has unique taunts and moves and all are distinctive from one another.  KFC may fall apart in many gameplay aspects, but it does quite well with character and presentation.  Ready, make fighting! The controls in Kung Fu Chaos are about as simple as they come, with the X and Y buttons serving as heavy and light attack, B for grab, A to jump, right trigger to block, and left trigger for a taunt.  Each character has only a handful of combos at their disposal, which you'll have experienced after only one or two matches.  There's no depth to be found here, but that's not a big shocker.  The only slightly tricky aspect to fighting is learning when to taunt.  Hit the left trigger just as you knock your opponent down to perform a successful barb.  Your target will have a tougher time getting up (giving you time to grab them and throw them to their death) and you'll earn one star.  Get three stars and you can squeeze both triggers to perform your character's one specific super move.  The super moves are quite cool and range from throwing dozens of shurikens to blasting fools with your double-barrel shotgun.  A super move is almost a sure kill in the game, so learning to taunt is the key to your ultimate success.    Problem is, once you figure the taunt out (give it three fights) the game becomes almost too easy.  Especially when you take on people who don't know how to taunt properly.  There's no learning curve for KFC at all.  The only skills needed are the taunt and playing through each level once or twice to see when programmed events will occur.  While no one expects great depth in a party game, there's even less to KFC than is acceptable.  There are so few moves that combos become an unconscious act.  I know, for example, when I take control of Ninja Fu Hiya the three combos I need to hit.  And I do them again and again and again.  Do a combo, get someone on the ground, taunt them, pick them up, toss them off the stage.  It's as easy as 1-2-3.  Assuming you have three fingers to count on, that's pretty damn easy.  Too easy, even for a four-player party fighter.  Death is a regular event in any KFC fight.  Unlike most fighters, your goal isn't to beat your foe down just one time.  Instead, each character has a number of lives that they can lose.  The winner at the end of a match is whoever's left standing or whoever had the best kill ratio.  If death doesn't appeal to you, you can switch up the goals to include things like having the most mojo or earning the most style points in a bout.  It's always nice to be able to change things up.    He who steps lightly, falls last Like Powerstone 2, KFC features moving environments filled with troublesome obstacles.  As players kick, punch, and throw one another about the set, the environment itself conspires against them.  For example, when fighting on the set of the Titanic, player's battle as the ship sinks.  As cardboard cut-out extras fall to their watery graves, players must sidestep them at every moment as well as avoid sliding pianos, falling chunks of ice, and the chilly water of the Atlantic.    Sounds cool in theory, but in practice it's not nearly as fun.  The camera sometimes gets too low, making it difficult to see where you're standing.  And when you have three other characters on a small surface that is moving across an environment filled with obstacles, it's incredibly confusing.  The single-player experience is good and even with two players it's not too bad.  But the moment you have four character crowding in, it becomes a nightmare of confusion filled with statements like, ~What the &$%* is going on?!~  Not something you want from a party game.  The environments are smart.  You get a Jurassic Park rip-off and an old western stage and even a '50s Martian invasion set.  But the events occur the same every time you play.  So, while you may be surprised to have a lifeboat land on you the first time you play the Titanic level, you'll know to expect it every single time afterwards.  In a way, this helps add some slight strategy to a fight, because you can try and position others to take the brunt of an event.  But, in the end, that slight bit of strategy can't overcome how endlessly repetitive the levels begin to feel.  KFC may seem fresh and new at first, but it becomes seriously old hat after several hours of play.  Ancient modes path to enlightenment By far the best aspect of KFC, oddly enough, is the single-player mode Ninja Challenge.  In the Ninja Challenge, you choose any of the available characters and take them through twenty-seven challenges.  Some are standard fights, others are interesting (though sometimes poorly constructed) mini-games.  Overall, this is by far the most enjoyable aspect of KFC, which is weird for a party game.  Add to this the miniseries mode where you can play through three player-specific scenes for each character and you've got a good ten hours of single-player enjoyment.    KFC also offers a variety of good multiplayer modes.  You can play with up to four people or you can switch in bots if you want.  While a free for all is always possible, you can also have team battles and even run through a championship mode where players compete across a variety of stages and mini-games for an overall winner.  The play modes are great.  In fact, it's these modes that give KFC any life and hope at all.  However, the weak gameplay really kills Kung Fu Chaos in the end.    The warrior is one... except when his friends come over to play The single-player aspects are worthy of merit.  But this is a party game, intended for four players fighting each other at one time.  Powerstone 2 tried the same thing and failed.  With Powerstone 2 the camera was too far away, the players too removed from the action and the adventure elements more prominent than the fighting.  Well, KFC fixes some of this.  The camera is now much tighter so you can actually see everyone and the environments, while longer than in Powerstone 2, aren't very wide.  You can't move beyond what you see on screen, which helps keep the action contained.  But the adventure aspects still overshadow the fighting at times.  It seems that because the fighting engine is so incredibly basic that the adventure aspects had to be pumped up to compensate.  As cool as it might be to watch UFOs destroying a city, it's really not that much fun to hop from building to building over a 30 second span without throwing a single punch.  And things get absolutely hectic with four characters on screen.  By yourself, when it's just you and three bots, it's really not so bad.  But throw in three other players and even a seasoned KFC veteran will get a headache.  It's tough to see where you are at times, tough to tell what is going on with the environment, and really a pain in the ass to leap from frog head to frog head while seeing three other characters mixing it up.  KFC is a good single-player experience, but isn't nearly as enjoyable when your friends come by.  That's just not what a party game is supposed to be.    You Like Massage for Your Eyes? Kung Fu Chaos isn't going to light any graphical fires.  The animations are limited, the backgrounds look good but aren't anything special, and there's little oomf to the special effects.  Obviously a light-hearted fighting game doesn't need to be ultra-realistic, but at the same time, KFC seems to shy away from tapping into the graphical power Xbox provides.  KFC doesn't impress, doesn't awe, doesn't astound.  It's your average Xbox graphics.  However, the smart art design is enough to push this up a notch.  Gotta love the visible wires on the characters when they jump from scene to scene.  Be Silent, Like Ninja There are cheesy sounds aplenty in KFC, as there should be.  And while the sound effects are very limited, it's hard to complain about that aspect since it fits in with the whole ~bad action movie~ theme.  But what does suck is the lack of music variety.  It's great to hear ~Kung Fu Fighting~ ever five minutes, but at the same time there are a lot of other great '70s tunes out there that could also have been licensed for the game.  Fortunately, you can use your own custom soundtracks, which is why my version of KFC plays the theme from Shaft whenever I go into battle.  Most of the characters come to bat with only a few phrases.  But director Shao Ting, who talks throughout many of the levels, has a seemlingly endless supply of malapropisms and insults.  He's truly a riot.  Even funnier than former IGN Xbox intern Kaiser ~Benedict Arnold~ Hwang.  Okay, that's not so hard.  But hey, better than being less funny than Mr. Hwang.  Shao Ting is the best comedy in the game, far better than any of the site gags which tend to fall a bit flat.   I have to hand it to Microsoft.  When we first saw KFC it was total crap.  There was nothing enjoyable about the game whatsoever.  The half-year delay has truly saved this game from being a total waste of disc space.  However, it's still a very flawed game that just doesn't work with four players.KFC is a tough one to judge for me.  I put in a lot of hours in the single-player mode and really, really dug it.  But when playing multiplayer, it was never a joy.  I've yet to play with anyone who wasn't totally frustrated, annoyed, or bored by the game in a multiplayer match.  Everyone I've tricked into player single-player has had fun.  But, the multiplayer just isn't good. As much as I like the single-player modes, the truth is this is a multiplayer game.  It's a party game.  And as such, it's not so good.  If you just want to enjoy this by yourself or possibly with one other friend, I'd say rent it first and test it out then buy it if you like it.  But as a party game intended for four buddies at once, it's a big no.  So sorry, try again.", "date": "Feb 19, 2003"}
