{"name": "Poker Pop World Tour", "name_review": "Poker Pop Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/06/11/poker-pop-review", "text": "The casual landscape has yielded a crop of successful games ported to mobile, including Bejeweled, Zuma, and Diner Dash. Add Poker Pop World Tour to the line-up, as Glu Mobile's edition of the PlayFirst-published casual is an extremely playable game that smartly combines elements of poker and mahjong.   Poker Pop casts the player a jet setting playboy, traveling the world to play this mash-up in locations like Fuji and Australia. City-hopping is accomplished by beating boards composed of an endless stream of poker-themed tiles. The goal is to create high-value hands from connected tiles, hitting requirements like so many three-of-a-kinds or flushes to register a win. It's a very simple premise and you have a few levels to get your sea legs before the game starts to roil the water.   The field of tiles is often plagued by perils. Perils block moves or threaten to sabotage your game plan, such as freezing an entire area of the field. Smoldering tiles also threaten your play if not matched up before long. To counter-balance the perils, you can also enjoy power-ups such as joker wildcards, score multipliers, and tile scrambler that make it a little easier to spot hidden hands.   The entire package here works exceptionally well -- the game has a very engaging flow, it ramps up the difficulty with a real degree of fairness, and the presentation is both pleasing and clean. (No worries about not being able to read tiles.) In addition to the main ~campaign,~ you can also check out an endless arcade mode and a challenge mode that harasses you with a timer. These three modes combined equal plenty of play value -- I suspect you'll see four or five hours from this game unless you turn into a hopeless addict.  Poker Pop cashes in on the continuing poker craze without being a ~me too~ entry. The combination of mahjong and poker works quite well -- I can see why this was such a success for PlayFirst on the PC circuit. There's a lot of game here and plenty of replay value, making it an easy recommendation to casual gaming fans.", "date": "Jun 11, 2007"}
