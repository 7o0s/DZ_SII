{"name": "Persona", "name_review": "Persona", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/10/21/persona", "text": "Persona is the perfect title for any RPG fan who craves something different. Taking place in a world all too close to our own, this philosophical game departs from traditional swords and sorcery to deliver a tale of dreams, the purpose of life, and who we are as individuals.   But to find the answer to these questions, be prepared to face hundreds of monsters and dozens of well thought out puzzles. Add to this a unique method of spellcasting (similar to Final Fantasy 3's espers), multiple endings, a hidden character, plus much more, and you have an RPG masterpiece.
