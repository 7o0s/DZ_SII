{"name": "Warriors of Might and Magic", "name_review": "Warriors of Might and Magic", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/03/21/warriors-of-might-and-magic-3", "text": "The Might and Magic series goes so far back into the annals of videogame history (OK, the industry isn't more than 30 years old, but the game goes way back there), that few people remember the first game with its simple commands and strategy-based gameplay. It's strange now to see Warriors of Might and Magic, an altogether different game from its originator. Oddly enough, Warriors harks a ways back, too. It's a classic return to familiar ground: the hack-and-slash RPG, steeped in  clichd Dungeons and Dragons lore. It's a direct descendant of the earliest computer RPGs, except here, it's on the PS2, upon which people have placed much higher expectations, besides great gameplay. Warriors hits and misses its marks. It's neat looking in many respects, its levels big and diverse, and aspects that aren't normally good in a 3DO game are reasonably impressive here, such as sound effects and special effects. In many ways Warriors of Might and Magic is a decent game. In many ways, it's pure retread material. GameplayWhile many a console gamer might enjoy this style of game, fans of turn-based RPGs who enjoy Final Fantasy, Lunar, and heck, even the action-RPG Brave Fencer Mushashi are sure to grow downright bored with it. You see every time Warriors does something well, it does another thing badly. In many respects, Warriors is quite pleasing: it's filled with special lighting, water, fogging and particle effects, the range of textures is hardy, and the amount of items and weapons is abundant. The reward system is generous. The levels occasionally clever designed. The CG is clean and well choreographed. Like I said, it hits the mark in several areas. With Warriors, it's not the clothes on the emperor that causes the trouble, it's the skin and bones themselves. Warriors of Might and Magic has one of the clunkiest, most simplistic fighting systems ever, and a limping framerate and animation system to go with it. And if you want to count the AI, if you can call it that, it also helps to sink the game, too. Along with these elements is a decent story, at best. These are the things that will eventually attempt to dull your senses and numb your wits.  OK, that's not terribly nice, but Warriors struck me as fun for about one hour, when I got to encounter all sorts of little puzzles, fought off some demons and skeletons and then collected millions of little gold pieces. Like the PC series Diablo, Warriors is built around the relentless element of collecting, which keeps pushing you to increase your inventory, and to push for the next coolest thing. I was also curious enough to see all of the levels, dungeons, and countless side quests, which were all fun and neat in their own regard, mostly because of their looks and atmosphere, but little else. In fact, when I realized that I was just going to bash the poop out of everything in the same repetitive fashion in an endless dungeon crawl for 10 more hours, the idea of playing for even the next several hours was horrifying. You see, while Warriors comprises the gameplay element of collection frenzy and coin-op combat, it's neither fast, nor for the most part does it make you feel smart. It plays to your lower senses, not the higher ones. Let's address the combat system first. I personally dislike turn-based battle systems, so I am a candidate for liking Warriors. But the reason why a game like Final Fantasy has grown so popular isn't because of the rather drawn-out fighting sequences (although the opposite can be argued). It's because of the imaginative storyline, interesting characters, and surprising plot twists. And since Warriors is lacking in the storyline department, which is really more like a loose backstory than anything else, and there is only one main character, Alleron, who's essentially a ~warrior,~ (i.e. a big strong brute with fewer brain cells than most), that leaves plot twists, which are few and far between. The whole idea of an intriguing story doesn't hold up very well in Warriors, and isn't terribly interesting even when it does show its funny head.Ah, but Warriors is an action-RPG, which gives it more razzle-dazzle, more...bang-'em up action, right? Gong. Have you ever fought dozens of monsters with the same attack patterns? I mean, literally, the exact same fighting patterns? You hit, I block. My turn. I hit, you can't block, I do damage. Your turn. You hit, I block. My turn. I hit, you can't block, I do damage. Repeat until enemy is dead. I've played a game like that, it's called Warriors of Might and Magic. You can time an enemy's attack in your sleep, and they're so dull, even a baby monkey can beat the AI. And much like the animation and framerate, the overall control is awkward, clunky, and slow. Luckily, your dumb brute of a lead character isn't all brawn (just mostly). He's kind of an all-in-one wizard/warrior, because he also can cast spells. In fact, it's loaded with spells and potions, which adds to the moderate fun. The spell-casting system works by pressing Circle, when enough mana is present. Players can cast spells from fire to ice to electric bolts, and the relatively easy spell menu enables on-the-fly selections that protect your character while making the choices. That part of the functionality is pretty good, and it breaks up the mundane fighting nicely. However, aiming from a distance is difficult and annoying, which sort of defeats the purpose on many levels. The puzzles are primitive. They're really for first-graders. Nearly all of them are right there, easy to find, easy to solve. Brains simply aren't required. A few examples are like...step on four parts of the ground to open a secret door, or find wood and a flint to light a fire. Those are the earliest ones, but even in the later levels, they don't get tough enough to warrant a second grade graduation certificate to play. What happens when you play Warriors is quite weird. Unlike the PlayStation version of this game, which looked bad but had a great framerate and quick control, this version boasts a horrible framerate and clunky control. The levels are quite big and they're well textured and plush with cool fogging effects and lots of lighting effects, too. As you progress, Alleron himself grows more detailed and distinct, clothed with better armor, new shields and weapons, too. Then you take a good look at the game in motion, and you wonder what happened. Watching Alleron or any enemy in hand-to-hand combat is like watching a 10-year old perform a GI Joe fighting with two dolls, their arms swinging mechanically, rigidly, and stiffly up and down, elbows taught and straight, action all from the shoulder, banging on each other, until one falls dead, like some one dropped a plank of wood. The only neat thing about the death animation in Warriors is the silly way in which some enemies crumble into a dozen or so pieces, or how they fall croaking to the floor (and with some enemies, you can pound them as they slump to the planks, which is kinda fun, too). This doesn't happen fast, either. The framerate and the animation are slow as molasses. It's all sort of surreal, but not in the ~good trip~ kind of way.What does work is that many obvious things are well sorted out. Like for instance, you know when you go to find an item in Tomb Raider, and it's a pain the arse just to pick up? You have to step exactly on the right spot, or you simply fail? It's lame. Here, if you just get close to an item and press R1, bam! You pick it up. The same goes for picking up treasure, weapons, and anything else. It's convenient, and it makes the game a little more enjoyable. Likewise, the camera system is, for the most part, pretty sophisticated. Players move Alleron with the left analog, and then move the right one to change his viewpoint. When trapped in a small corner, the camera never clips outside a wall. It always zooms inside the wall, and on occasion, Alleron becomes transparent, to he doesn't get in your way. The only case where this fails is when Alleron moves quickly in a small place, then the camera zips around, zooming in and out, winding up the player into a dizzy fit.GraphicsAs I have been spouting about on and off in the gameplay section, I have mentioned a little bit about the graphics. To be honest, the graphics are, for the most part, the best part of Warriors. Much like the original PlayStation hardware, the PS2 is especially good with lighting and special effects. 3DO has gone to town with special effects and has found neat ways to primp up the lighting effects. For instance, the simple torches look like they're real flames, with a heat wave rising above them. In some areas, skeletons reach out from under cells, and the mixture of transparent bodies and cool blue lighting creates an eerie effect that works perfectly. 3DO has used many colors in the PS2 palette, creating neat looking cool icy dungeons, woody structures, and neat mists. In one level, an invisible ghost, but formed by a glowing blue cloud, is scripted to run down a hallway, trying to escape something, you or a little insect, whatever. Either way, it's a nice touch. In another clever way to create depth and scale, the stories in most dungeons are intricately layered so that second stories cross over one another, giving players the chance to look down, through gratings, down bridges, or what have you. In some levels a bottomless pit may stand 20 feet from a two-story plunge, the latter being the one to jump down. The sense of scale is usually countered with endless small rooms and corridors, but when they wanted to, the folks at 3DO designed some nicely constructed, many-storied levels that show off the system's massive polygonal capabilities, without fogging or pop-in. Just to be Germane, while the levels look good and the enemies are occasionally creative and neat looking, the animation is horrible, the framerates are sluggish, and a wave of simplicity glazes the whole game's look, to boot. SoundHere's where things really get weird, if they weren't already. Ninety-nine percent of the times, 3DO games sputter out the worst music and sound effects on the planet. Just pick any Army Men game (sans Air Attack 2), and you'll hear horrible music, voices, and sound effects all squared off with poor production values. In Warriors, the music is often eerie and spooky. It's not so much like music as it is atmospheric background filler, but even at that low level, it creates a little anxiety and tension, and it kept me creeped out. There are incidental sound effects, too, like the loose change in your pocket or your armor clinking around, creating a neat audio effect that makes the player listen carefully to what is happening. On the other hand, while the music and atmospheric sounds do its job, the monster voices are a mixed blessing, ranging from spooky to just plain stupid. First, the monsters usually only mutter one kind of thing: one kind of groan or grunt. So, if they see you, they make a noise, the same noise as when they are hit, jump, or hit you. Perhaps some creatures make a noise when they die, which is a simplistic variation of their original consonant-free vocab they've used for hundreds of years. The timing of their groans is another subject altogether. These guys sit in one corner of a room for centuries making their one sound until you show up and then they see you and utter their pathetic sound with earnest and interest. Everything is slightly out of whack, sound wise.Warriors of Might and Magic is a simple, hack-and-slash RPG that tries to combine fast-action combat with the compelling elements of collecting and upgrading. Players who love to collect and upgrade will adore this game, but at the same time, those same people probably also enjoy fast framerates, a good story, and even the slightest variation in combat, none of which appear in this game. The combat is not only slow when it should be fast, it's dumb when it should only be only slightly more intelligent.  While Warriors is a gorgeous looking in game in many respects and boasts an intriguing sense of atmosphere, the music and the mood are hampered by inane sound effects from an army of dumb acting and dumb-sounding monsters, and repetitive, mindless gameplay. If you want a decent action game, buy Oni, Z.O.E., or Onimusha, and if you want an RPG, try out Summoner or wait until Dark Cloud comes out. Warriors of Might and Magic hits the mark on a few cylinders, but its clumsy, redundant nature will put you to sleep, and for a videogame, which is by definition supposed to be ~entertaining,~ that's not a good sign.", "date": "Mar 21, 2001"}
