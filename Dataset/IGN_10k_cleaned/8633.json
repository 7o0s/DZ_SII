They just keep coming! Maybe this one will replace all the numbers with less recognizable objects. Or perhaps it will have dragons that try to mask its incompetent design. Is it also a minigame battle title? Fortunately, the team at Jaleco realized that in order to make a dent in the already flooded Sudoku market, they'll have to offer something more than a stupid gimmick, and they do. In fact they offer four things more, making their Sudoku centered puzzle title a refreshing change of pace, though still not the best out there.    Brain Buster Puzzle Pak compiles five different puzzles that it claims are ~sweeping a nation.~ That nation is supposedly Japan, because, besides Sudoku, these puzzles are unfamiliar. The five puzzles are all of the number/logic variety. The kind that look like math puzzles, but really aren't.    Kakuro is the only gave that actually uses any math, though it's rudimentary addition. In this Sudoku-esque puzzle, players must fill in blank squares with non repeating numbers. The numbers in the row or column have to add up to the number at the end. The other puzzles are more logic based, using numbers as clues.    In Light On, players have to place glowing bubs in positions dictated by number clue squares to light up the entire board. The numbers tell players where some of the bulbs go, and they have to figure out the rest based on how the light fills up the board.    Nurikabe is a puzzle where players have to create little ~islands~ on the board for each number, and fill in the rest of the spaces. Certain rules dictate how much space of ~sea~ can be between each island, forcing players to figure out the best way to make each island.    The object of Slitherlink is to make a connecting line that touches sides with every number on the board, but only as many times as the number allows. So the line can only cross by a one, once, but has to hit three sides of the square with a three.    The puzzles are all pretty fun, for those that like logic puzzles. They offer a nice change of pace from the plethora of Sudoku games out there, and create a balanced array of puzzles to choose from. Some of them, like Lights On and Nurikabe are somewhat simple and faster paced. They work well as palette cleansing puzzles in between marathon runs of Sudoku or Kakuro. Each puzzle, while using a similar strategy, plays very differently. It doesn't feel like the same puzzle game with five different coats of paint. Players will likely discover their favorite couple puzzles and stick with those. Honestly, it would have been preferable if Sudoku was just left out entirely, and Brain Buster consisted of five different puzzles to play.    Brain Buster is played using only the touch screen, leaving the top screen to display the time and current ranking for the puzzle being played. As the time in the game progresses, the player's ranking goes down, thus encouraging players to finish as fast as possible. It's a little frustrating since the tie clock is as big as the actual puzzle board, and players can see their rank going down slowly. There's no option to turn it off, even in the practice mode, so players can't have a relaxing round of Kakuro, it has to be a timed, you-just-lost-your-Master-ranking round. Players have the option of going back and replaying puzzles to beat their score, however, for a lot of the games, it's not near as fun the second time through.    As far as Sudoku games go, Brain Buster is thankfully not nearly the worst one out there. While it doesn't incorporate some of the fancier options like handwriting recognition, it still makes use of the touch screen controls. Players tap a number on the sidebar, and then tap the square they want to put the number in. The essentials to playing, like the ability to add notes to the corner of the squares, are in there. There's also an option to have the row and column a player selects highlighted to help tell whether it's the right spot for a number. Brain Buster has an answer ball feature to help out stumped players. By hitting the answer ball, then selecting a square, the correct number, or object will be filled in. It's not extremely useful for games like Light On where most of the field is blank, but for games like Sudoku or Kakuro it can really help revitalize a stagnant puzzle.       Each game has 50 puzzles to play initially. That may be a substantial amount for Sudoku, but for games like Light On, which generally last under 30 seconds, those puzzles are quickly completed. Players can unlock more puzzles by going back through and completing all the puzzles in a short enough time to earn a master ranking. Thankfully, there is also a section that makes randomly generated puzzles to play, but they don't give the player points, or count towards the number of completed puzzles played.    For experienced puzzle players, Brain Buster is going to be a cake walk. The difficulty does creep up along the 50 puzzles, but it doesn't get hard at all. The game is more like a beginners guide to logic puzzles. It's nice that the developers included answer balls, and helpful tools to make the game easier for beginners, but it should have been balanced out with harder modes so the puzzle gurus could have something to be challenged by.   While it is certainly not a justification, Brain Buster is not the worst Sudoku game on the DS. Of course it's not nearly the best one either. What it lacks in glitz, it tries to make up for it by having a wider selection of puzzles to play. Of course, with all the other Sudoku game gimmicks out there, it's a little weird for theirs to be ~You can play these other games instead.~ Brain Buster is a solid, and pretty entertaining puzzle collection, bit it is really only for people that are new to this whole puzzle craze thing, and for people that prefer their relaxing, personal puzzles to be timed, ranked, point counting competitions.", "date": "Jun 13, 2007"}
