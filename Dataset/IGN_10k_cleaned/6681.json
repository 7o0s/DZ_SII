Kayak Interactive wisely zeroed in on this evergreen license, publishing a pleasant assortment of silly mini-games starring the trio of oddballs: Larry, Curly, and Moe. The game stretches a pretty loose plot around the mini-games. The Stooges agree to raise $300 to help a suffering orphanage by doing a series of jobs and tasks that indeed include pizza throwing, which gives a little extra layer of depth to the subtitle Makin' Dough.    Three Stooges is a completely innocuous game, full of clever little nods to classic Stooges humor, but is admittedly as shallow as Curly is smart. That's not necessarily a slight. A lot of successful mobile games are surface affairs, and some of the mini-games in Three Stooges are real winners. Almost each game is timed, so you are never in a single event long enough to get bored -- a very wise design decision from developer Big Blue Bubble.   Mini-games include the aforementioned pizza making, where you throw dough into warm ovens. You must avoid slapping Larry and Moe on the face with the wet dough, as well as not mistakenly tossing the dough in fiery ovens where it gets burnt. There is a whack-a-mole mini-game in a garden where Curly and Larry also show their heads as much as the pesky moles.  The Three Stooges link arms in a brewery mini-game, as you try to collect beer drippings in only Larry and Moe's buckets. If Curly gets under the sauce, he'll drink it -- and then your controls are temporarily reversed. A moving game sees the Stooges passing valuable belongings in a chain, trying to get them in boxes. This is only a sampling -- there are a few more events.   There really isn't a dud in the bunch, but some are more fun than others -- and worth a lot more money. I found it almost too easy to keep selecting the whack-a-mole game (you use a slot machine to select three events at a time -- then you choose one to play) and rake up $80 per play. It's much harder to earn cash during the drinking game or the laundry mini-game. From time to time, you can play a quick card game with a nefarious type that steals $50 if you choose the wrong card.   Big Blue Bubble did a solid job with the graphics. I tested the game on an LG VX8000, and thought all of the Stooges sprites were nicely detailed with giant heads that looked as much like their real-life counterparts as you're gonna get with only a few dozen pixels. The game screens are bright and colorful. The audio is also quite slick, as the makers were granted use of some voice clips. You hear Curly's ~whoo-whoo-whoo~ over loading screens, as well as an assortment of ~hey Moe!~ and ~Nyuk-nyuk!~ outbursts. Good stuff.  Three Stooges: Makin' Dough is just a breezy little collection of mini-games that you'll have a week or so of fun with. If that doesn't sound like a value to you, then I'd understand if you overlooked the game. It really is kinda shallow, but I think fans of the Stooges (and they are legion) will have a good time with these jokers. I know this fan -- who did pay to download it -- did.", "date": "Mar 2, 2006"}
