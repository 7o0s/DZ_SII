Since Visual Concepts debuted their NBA franchise on the Dreamcast its been the pro hoop simulation to beat.   It's the game professional athletes, not just NBA players turn to when they want to fire up some NBA action from the living room sofa. Why? Because no hoop game has captured the grace and athleticism as consistently or as well as the NBA 2K series. The power of the Xbox simply presents VCs proven animation and physics system with stunning clarity and detail. You can gain new appreciation for Allen Iversons agility or Shaquille ONeals strength just from watching this game.However, for all that NBA 2K2 does well, it inherits many of the shortcomings and problems weve had with previous editions of the franchise.  GameplayJust like they have with the passing game in their NFL 2K series, VC seems to have taken one crucial element of pro basketball, worked like hell to perfect it and let everything else fall in place after that. In NBA 2K2, the AI and physics of the game work so well together, its difficult to figure out which came first. The AI in NBA 2K2 is tougher than ever. By tough we mean, your margin of error is extremely small and youll have to play well consistently to defeat the CPU in a solo game. This will be good news for hoop junkies who want to get plenty of value out of their NBA sims but rookies may be easily intimidated. On offense youll have to be creative because the defense in 2K2 adjusts quickly when it looks like youve found an easy scoring option. Pounding the ball inside with Shaquille ONeal for the entire game  won't even work because the opponent will start swarming him with defenders. Even if youre bull-headed enough to keep feeding the rock to Shaq, hell start to get tired dragging those defenders around and his shot percentage will plummet. And its the same case with any other marquee player. The defense will put constant double teams on Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady or Vince Carter to keep them from driving. Hot shooters like Ray Allen or Reggie Miller will have to work harder and come off more screens to get open shots. You get the idea.We  don't  want to sound like your high school hoops coach but in 2K2 You gotta let the points come to you! and operate within the framework of the offense!. New controls like the pass to player closest to hoop button are marvelous new additions to old favorites like the special dribble or call for pick buttons. To work the offense effectively you have to read and react to what the defense is giving you and be good enough on the controls to pass and make moves quickly. Youll have to know that it takes half a second for Iverson to set up his crossover or other special move off the dribble when you hit the B button. In that time, everybody on the floor can be in a different position. But if youre comfortable with the momentum based physics of the game, youll know that The Answer only needs six inches of daylight to get by his man. If hes within range hell continue on to the hoop, but this illustrates the marvelous integration of physics and artificial intelligence in 2K2. This is the stuff the best sports games are made of. On defense you have to play tight and then hope for a little luck because the CPU is extremely aggressive and confident shooting the ball. This is also the end of the floor where youll get the most out of 2K2s coaching system. Youll need to assign matchups, set the amount of pressure and call appropriate situational defenses so that you can keep the computer opponent just as frustrated as you are. You can call defensive sets (full court pressure, man to man, etc.) on the fly using the right analog stick just like you do for offensive playcaling. Plus youll get plenty of use out of the new switch to the last man back button. That ones great for stopping drives to the hoop. If you  don't  spend the same amount of effort on defensive strategy that you do on offense, the CPU will have no problem shooting well over 70% on you game after game after game, like we saw in the PS2 version. Youll be shooting a high percentage as well but with all of those points being dropped, it will be easy to fall behind in a hurry. In fact, stopping scoring streaks is why sound defense is important because once the CPU gets their offense going, they can quickly blow a game wide open.    How you choose to control your players on defense is really a matter of taste. Controlling a quick guard who can scurry around stealing the ball from taller players has its risks and rewards as does patrolling the lane with a shot-blocking big man. Again though, this is where the physics of 2K2 come into play. The new steal animation that lets your guy jump into a passing lane has its own precise timing thats difficult to master, but well worth it if you do. Blocking shots is one of the more difficult skills in the game since it more or less comes down to the computers decision on whether or not you timed it correctly. There were several instances when we were perfectly positioned for a block and even saw the ball pass through our defenders hand on the way to the basket for two points. It wasnt registered as block because the shot blocker clearly went up late, nevermind the fact that our guy was 611 and the shooter was 6.In fact collision detection problems is our major gripe about 2K2s basketball engine. Youll commit far too many goaltending violations in efforts to grab timely rebounds because players can reach right through the rim and net to touch the rock. When was the last time you heard of a player at any level of basketball goaltending a free throw? And remember with all of the high shooting percentages there  won't be more than a dozen or so misses to rebound anyway. Continuing with the theme, the collision detection will frustrate you on defense in other ways as well. Weve already told you that lining up for a block shot and timing it are extremely difficult, but the insult added to the injury is that players, not just the basketball will pass through your defender as well. And not just his hand. Even if were late getting a guy in position and hitting the jump button to block the shot, we should get something positive for getting him there before the shot gets off. The defender should change the shot one way or another either by fouling him with his body or simply being a tall guy with long arms in the way. Far too often the offensive player is at an advantage once hes into his scoring animation because hell simply ghost through a defender and shoot a percentage as if the defender isnt even there. That is, once Latrell Sprewell starts to wind up his dunk animation, nobody, not Dikembe Mutombo nor Shawn Bradley standing right in front of him, is going to stop it. If you wanted to stop the dunk, you shouldnt have given him the lane and the ball. We would be fine if offensive players could be bumped in mid-air and they still make circus shots all the time, but ghost play down around the hoop just isnt any fun. The gameplay modes in 2K2 include Street, Practice, Tourney, Exhibition, Franchise, Season, Fantasy and Playoffs. Thats more than enough to keep basketball fans knee deep in this game. The Franchise, Season and Fantasy Modes are especially well done and deep enough with plenty of details and things to do off the court. The Street Mode features nine courts made famous by movies and word-of-mouth like Rucker Park in NYC and Run N Shoot in Atlanta. Theyre accurate right down to the posters at the late Hank Gathers Rec Center, but where are all of the scantily clad gold-diggers and entourages? GraphicsThe players in 2K2 are as crisp and clean as their original Dreamcast brethren could have ever hoped to be. Weve already raved about the animation but it cant hurt to rave some more, because the players move with an illusion of weight and mass that makes the whole thing work. When it comes to the players VC included all of the accurate facial hair, tattoos, headbands, wrist bands, high tops, socks of every player represented. This includes Kevin Garnetts excessively baggy shorts as well as Bob Cousys old school tighty shorts. The facial animations are the same was weve seen in previous editions of NBA 2K but they just look sharper in this Xbox game. But if youre looking for the new and improved Xbox only graphics feature look no further than the populated baselines. Dance teams, ball boys and photographers are all crowded together and fully animated in the out of bounds area. The players may not move with the same explosiveness as their real life counterparts but the speed of their animations is very consistent within the game. That is, the difference between Jason Kidd walking the ball up the court and pushing the ball on the break is very believable in relation to the speed of every other player. Quick guys are noticeably quicker than the big lumbering oafs because you can see them pumping their arms and moving their feet faster thanks to their smaller frames. In the low post game, youll really see the effects of momentum on the player animation. Rasheed Wallace lowers his center of gravity when you squeeze the L trigger and he begins leaning his weight into the defender as he moves towards the basket. When you release the trigger youll see sheed stay low and roll his way around the defender step by step on his way to the basket. Staying low and executing the footwork is the key to the move and what separates good low post players from the bad ones. Youll actually recognize the fact that the defender cant move because Wallace is too low and too quick around the corner going to the basket. Even a packaged animation like this flows seamlessly into the next move where he goes up for the dunk or layup. It's illustrated most dramatically in the post up game but youll appreciate the animation in the open court as well. Earlier, we mentioned the tiny opening Iverson needs to shake his defender, but once he does, all it takes is two of those long ass NBA steps for A.I. to raise up for a jam. NBA 2K2 links all of these elements together seamlessly, in real time and at a believable speed. The replays are also worth mentioning. Multiple camera angles or even super extended replays of spectacular moves are a very welcome addition. Theyre at least as well done and well timed as the replays in NFL 2K2. SoundBob (Bob Steel) Fitzgerald and Rod (Rod West) Brooks are back yet again with much of the same tired commentary weve heard two or three times before in this game. Rod West still wants guys like THIS on his team if he was still coaching and so and so forth. The few new lines of commentary  don't  do nearly enough to make the play by play in this game fresh and exciting for the Xbox in 2002. The two real life Bay Area sports radio guys were adequate when NBA 2K debuted two and a half years ago, but times have changed. New music in 2K2 is a given so why cant we have new commentary? Jermaine Dupri and the Beatminerz hooked up the main themes of NBA 2K2 and while none of the cuts would ever win a Grammy, they serve their purpose well in the game. The best part about the sound effects in the NBA 2K series is the chatter from the players and coaches. Even though most of their comments are as recycled as the announcers commentary, its still a great feature to have in a hoop game. Other than the squeaking sneakers, arena organ and crowd noises are very adequate and get the job done. I enjoy NBA 2K2 mainly because it won my heart a few years ago as the NBA sim of choice and this latest version on Xbox is the best VC hoop game out there. The established animation-physics system and tough-as-nails AI have kept millions of gamers locked to their TVs for hours at a time always playing just one more and Im one of them. On the Xbox, the game looks better than ever and plays the same as I remember from Dreamcast. Visual Concepts basketball engine will likely be refined even more when 2K3 comes out and this will be a great thing for all gamers. High Voltages surprisingly solid engine for NBA Inside Drive 2002 has suddenly turned the NBA sim derby into a two horse race.  Now that Sega Sports has established itself on other consoles with the 2K2 rounds of football and basketball, both as solid as expected, the future is going to be a bright one indeed for sports gamers.Upon its release NBA 2K2 will be the best NBA sim available on the Xbox, getting the nod over Inside Drive because Microsofts game lacked way too many features to be taken as a wholehearted effort. If youve been talking to your Xbox, waiting for your first hoop game, NBA 2K2 is it.", "date": "Feb 26, 2002"}
