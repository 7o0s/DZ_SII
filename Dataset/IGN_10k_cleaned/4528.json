Built over the ashes of the Great War, World War II technically began in 1933 when Adolf Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany, took Germany out of the League of Nations, and began to herd legions of Jewish people into concentration camps. For eight years the United States literally sat back--becoming strict isolationists under President Roosevelt--watching Germany, Italy and Japan create the axis under which much of the world--both in the European and Asian theaters--were taken over by the evil forces of Hitler, Mussolini and Hirohito.    This remained true until Japan awakened ~the sleeping giant~ on December 07, 1941. That day, according to Roosevelt, was a day that will live forever in infamy. It was also the day the United States began their quest to free the world as the very next day the U.S. declaring war on Japan and the rest, as they say, is history.   The epic nature of this global conflict is wonderfully relayed into the Medal of Honor series and the latest installment, Medal of Honor: Rising Sun is certainly no different. While the game left something to be desired (it's a little too short in my opinion), the soundtrack certainly hits the nail on the head. Filled with moody, lengthy, and surprisingly non-repetitive music, it complements game play rather nicely. And while the game itself is only a mere nine missions, there are over thirty uniquely orchestrated songs.    As is often the case with game soundtracks (much like movie soundtracks) that are comprised of original material in lieu of popular rock/rap/or other existing contemporary music, creating and setting a mood is very important. Composer and conductor Christopher Lennertz performs this task wonderfully, having written songs that are both emotional and awe inspiring. Tracks like ~Philippines/Zero Attack~ are so start-and-stop that it initially provides the listener with a reason to be nervous and then when the tempo slows down and becomes light-hearted, it instills the listener with a feeling of ~safety,~ only to tear it back down. I won't pretend to be an orchestra aficionado (I, in fact, am a rock drummer, with musical training on the other side of the spectrum), but I can certainly realize and appreciate the feeling of emotion that Lennertz creates in the music he writes; a feeling of emotion that drives Medal of Honor: Rising Sun to unparalleled heights in that department.    This music, not being of the weak and random variety that ruins the soundtracks of so many otherwise-epic games, gives the player the opportunity to further immerse himself into the gaming experience. When you're fighting through the caverns on the game's seventh mission and the ~Yamashita's Gold~ song unfolds in the background, you get the very real sense of urgency in what you're doing. This is a prime example of how both the game play and the awesome soundtrack combine to create an immersive experience that is equal parts sight and sound.    In terms of his compositions for the game, one thing that Lennertz has done wonderfully is to incorporate more Asian-sounding aspects into his music. This is accomplished through the use of various Asian flutes, percussion, as well as mandolins, and other stringed instruments. Tracks like ~Jungle Swarm~ stand out in this regard and much credit can be given to Lennertz for localizing his soundtrack efforts to the Pacific, as this is the first Medal of Honor game that takes place in the Pacific theater, instead of in the European theater. An incredible amount of credit must also go out to the ever-capable Hollywood Studio Symphony, which brought to life Lennertz's music. Their efforts, combined with the various guest musicians who provided the rarer Asian instrumentals sections, create an epic soundtrack experience that can only be compared to the efforts of John Williams and his work on the Star Wars and Indiana Jones films.   While Medal of Honor: Rising Sun, the game has gotten mixed reviews aplenty, Christopher Lennertz has written an original score unlike any you will find elsewhere in the world of videogames. Few game scores can provide the feelings aroused by this particular soundtrack--feelings of urgency, danger, and heroism. So play the game and play it loud. Let the music speak to you as you play and I guarantee you it will heighten your experience.There is little to say here except this: go buy it, and go buy it now. You won't be disappointed.", "date": "Mar 8, 2004"}
