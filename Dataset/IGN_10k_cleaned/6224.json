That's not to say there haven't been any paintball games, it's just that none of them have been particularly good. Enter Splat Magazine Renegade Paintball, a game that certainly has potential to take virtual interactive paintball to the next level. Unfortunately, this game suffers from significant problems in just about every department.   There's no real storyline in Splat, just a wide variety of game modes. When you begin you'll be given the chance to select one of nine personalities, all of whom are completely over exaggerated in their appearances. Essentially this is a pointless step, since none of the characters have any discernable differences between them. Afterwards you'll be free to choose between Career, Skirmish, Arcade, Multiplayer, and Level Editor modes.   You'll Wish You Had Bullets.   Playing through the single player portions of Splat is not an enjoyable experience. Even though there are a wide variety of game modes and paintball guns, it still proves to be frustrating at and times feels like your actions have no effect on the gameplay. Through each of the game's modes you'll be playing Deathmatch, Team Elimination, King of the Hill and a few Capture the Flag modes. In Career mode, the mode there should be the most engrossing single player experience, you'll find nothing more than a series of consecutive skirmishes. After each skirmish match you'll be assigned a point score based on shutout bonus, quick completion, accuracy, and frag bonus, among others. These will contribute to a running score as you progress. However, beyond that, there really isn't anything that differentiates Career mode from simply setting up a series of Skirmishes with identical parameters.   Splat chose to include a number of different personality types, but never wraps them into any kind of substantial storyline. Maybe if the career mode was accompanied by some sort of plot or featured specific character rivalries it might be able to set itself apart from the rest of the game. As it stands, Career mode doesn't make sense to play considering you can just create an almost identical game in Skirmish. It may have been necessary to play Career if it was required to unlock all the maps and guns for Skirmish, but it's not. A large number of maps and guns are available to choose from right from the first time you start up the game. Skirmish also allows you to customize your guns and even use custom maps, so why limit yourself to Career if there's a way more varied and more interesting assortment of options available in another mode?    As many options as there are in Skirmish, that doesn't mean you'll be getting into some entertaining gameplay. Mainly, this is because of Splat's enemy A.I. In many cases, both in Career mode and in Skirmish, we walked up on foes that were facing directly into the corner of a room. Even after we stood behind them for a few second and waited to see if they would turn around, they just stood still. We're assuming this isn't supposed to happen. There were also problems with the A.I. being way too smart. For instance, there were several instances where we'd descend quietly from a perch on top of a tower and exit out a back door. From our radar we could tell that the opponent was around the corner on the other side. Yet, as we emerged from our cover we would turn around to sneak up on our foes only to find that paintballs aimed at our face were already in flight. How had we been seen? How are the enemies so accurate yet also stupid enough to stare into a corner Blair Witch style? We don't know, but we can definitely say that players should not expect to fight against a consistent and well behaved A.I.   Some of the enemy A.I. issues could be overlooked provided you could spend a decent amount of time under cover and be able to pick precise shots. However, you'll find that none of the single player experiences in Splat revolve around stealth. Many of the Career mode Capture the Flag or Team Elimination matches turn into frantic blast fests. Oftentimes the result is your team losing and thereafter having to replay it if you want to advance. Mainly this is because the time limits that are imposed on you are way to short to allow for any sort of patience when picking your targets. Also, there's absolutely no way to control your team. In Skirmish mode the time limit can be increased, but you'll still find the experience to be unsatisfying because of one of the game's other problems, the inaccuracy of your paintball guns.     With the exception of the two highest accuracy guns, it's incredibly frustrating to hit an enemy and turns out to be a matter of luck rather than accuracy. I found that even at practically point-blank range I would miss an enemy with a paintball when I was aiming directly at them. At longer distances this becomes even more of a problem. It could be argued that the game is just trying to mimic the real life shooting patterns of paintball guns, but it really should have been tuned a little better in the game to make all of the guns fun to use. Stick to the PC version for better controls.   Better With Humans?   It was unclear whether or not the online multiplayer modes in this game were actually working. Occasionally we would jump into an online game and be able to see our enemies, sometimes they would be invisible. We noticed more problems with the PC version than the Xbox, such as being shot when nobody was shooting at us. With the Xbox version, we were able to play one or two maps where nothing seemed to go horribly wrong. Still, the multiplayer clearly had its share of serious problems.    Aside from those problems, you have the ability to customize your own maps and use them in online play. We played on a few custom maps online and found that after they were downloaded, we could actually go into the map editor and re-mod the modded maps and use them for play. The map editor is extremely detailed and a big reason why this game didn't get rated a lot lower than it did. There are a ton of terrain types, objects, and textures available so you can create an extremely wide variety of maps.   You'll also find that you actually need to lead your targets with your shots, proving there are some actual paintball physics in the game and some skill involved in getting successful shots off. Granted, you need to be using the top end guns to be accurate, but assuming everyone is using the same gun it can turn out to be enjoyable. You'll also find a wide variety of controls at your disposal, including leaning around corners, crouching, sprinting, going prone, and switching to a third person view. The prone command did seem a little ridiculous at times, however, since you drop to prone in about .2 seconds. If these were real people in the game, they would have shattered just about every bone in their body were they to be attempting this on a regular basis.    Remember what the graphics were like on the Nintendo 64? Well, aside from a few lighting effects, that's pretty much what you'll find here, in addition to noticeable slowdown. Textures are completely washed out, detail is minimal, and player models are boring. In addition, you'll find that computer controlled opponents and allies will skip around the field of play. Not skip in the happy-go-lucky sense, but actually teleport from one area to another. This can make aiming difficult when your enemies disappear and reappear at random times. The PC's graphics are generally sharper than the Xbox, but not a major improvement in any way.   Sound is no better. The announcer is laughably cheesy and pretty much the only sound effect you'll hear during gameplay is the repetitive clicking of your gun. Furthermore, the music is just awful and actually hampers the game experience. In fact, the rock music soundtrack could be classified as shockingly generic, based on your taste. Also, it drowns out the audio cues you'll need to listen for to hear someone sneaking up behind you. The music definitely needs to be turned off immediately. Once you've done that, you're left with a sparing amount of boring sound effects. The only thing really worth noting is that different surfaces underfoot make different sounds, so you'll want to stick to grass if you're sneaking up on someone.The single player portions of this game are not fun. The bot A.I. is erratic, models occasionally disappear and reappear steps ahead, and many of the games paintball guns are annoyingly inaccurate. Theres no story, the graphics are awful, and so are the games announcer and music tracks. Though entirely forgettable, the sound effects serve their purpose to a degree. The map editor is a great tool for anyone looking to extend the game's playability. The multiplayer modes appear to be horribly bugged, though we noticed more problems on the PC than on the Xbox. Pick this title up only if you have a burning, insatiable urge to play paintball. Otherwise steer clear, there are plenty of other games out there that feature first and third person shooting that are much, much better.", "date": "Oct 27, 2005"}
