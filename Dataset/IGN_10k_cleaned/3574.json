Still, as those pictures on the right look mighty lonely without a lot of text beside them, I'll try to expand on my disappointment just a bit.  First things first. In CTU Marine Sharpshooter, you take on the role of, you guessed it, a marine sharpshooter. A group of terrorists is in possession of the potential to make a nuclear weapon and you and your spotter have been sent in to find out what's going on and put a stop to it. Along the way, you'll visit such ~exotic locales~ as Afghanistan, Chechnya and the jungles of the Pacific islands. You'll be the sniper on the mission, with a single marine buddy to back you up.  You'll progress through each of the game's fairly small and linear levels endeavoring to shoot just about anything that moves. When you're out in the open, it's relatively easy to take out your opponents before they're even aware you're there. This is what being a sniper is about, after all. When you're in tunnels or warehouses, it's still just as easy to take out the enemies, but sniping from a mere thirty yards away seems a bit silly. You have a pistol for these situations but it's so much less powerful than the sniper rifle, that you'll almost never use it.  Marine Sharpshooter features a spectacularly unhelpful spotter. I have no idea how this albatross they've burdened you with ever passed basic training and obtained a position of responsibility in the marines but, if this is the kind of training we're giving the leathernecks, then I wouldn't even bet on them to take down the League of Women Voters. Let's start with his inability to actually hit anything. I've stood by giggling like a root canal patient while he's unloaded two full clips from his machine gun at an opponent only twenty yards away. The law of averages would seem to suggest that even my dog could hit him at least once but my marine spotter must never have studied probability in college. Assuming he even went to college. Luckily, the enemies seem to have just as hard a time hitting him so I guess it's a wash.  More often than not you'll actually be the one to kill your spotter. Sometimes you'll do this intentionally in outright frustration for his horrible pathfinding. He'll sometimes nudge you out beyond your cover if he feels the need to push up against your butt is too great. Then there are the times he walks right in front of you while you're trying to shoot your enemies. Pulling the trigger just as the fool walks right in front of your crosshairs is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, he gets what's coming to him; on the other hand, killing him means you have to reload the mission again.  Thank god for the handy (and oft-used) quick save and quick load keys.  Your spotter also has a pretty sorry AI and seems oblivious to your requests for him to ~hold position~ or ~follow.~ I'd be tempted to say that he comes along or remains behind out of some foreknowledge of events. But when he lags behind and gets shot to hell by enemies behind you or comes racing forward in to an area you haven't cleared and gets shot to hell by those enemies, you wonder if the game might not have been better titled CTU Marine Babysitter.  The spotter is sort of useful for pointing out enemies on your compass. A small bar that rolls across the top of your screen orients you towards the directions of the compass and small triangles indicate the direction of enemies spotted by your buddy. This can be fairly helpful in the more open levels but the game plays out too linearly for this to be much help. In any case, most of the enemies start screaming in Arabic once you get anywhere near them, so you won't need much help finding them on your own.  To be fair, your spotter will occasionally tell you which way to go in some of the game's larger levels. But simply saying, ~We need to EVAC~ doesn't really tell me much. It would be better if the spotter could actually point you in the direction of the next mission objective but maybe I'm just used to playing games that emphasize fun.  A few missions even designate certain areas as ~off-limits.~ If you stray too far (but not too far) outside the combat area, you die and the mission ends. This can be particularly irritating when you're scouring the level looking for the damn exit. Where's that quick load key again?      You can see from the shots that the game doesn't look fantastic. And by ~fantastic~ I mean ~good.~ Textures are quite flat and the lack of lighting doesn't really help to give shape to the otherwise flat environments. Character models are fairly convincing at most distances but the face geometry is much too simple. It makes all of the characters look as though they're wearing pantyhose on their heads.  The game also has a problem in its contrasts. Some of the levels (like the first one) are far too dark while others (like the snow one) are far too bright. I was constantly adjusting the brightness so I could see the dark things and not be blinded by the bright things. I did make use of the game's nightvision effect but after seeing the new approach in Raven Shield, this nightvision just looks sad. This nightvision effect simply looks as if someone replaced your monitor with a bowl of lime sherbert. A pale green filter simply lightens things with no regard to ambient light.  A few odd graphical bugs reared their heads now and then during the game. During one infuriating sequence, I was unable to exit zoom mode. Trying to finish the rest of the level with severe tunnel vision was a new frustration for me. Enhancing both the aggravation and humor of the bug, my vision stayed zoomed in even as a I switched to my knife or pistol. There's also been some strange blurring that crops up as you lean left or right. It doesn't happen a lot but often enough to mention.  I always joke that I'm going to kill our Gameboy editor because he constantly leaves the most annoying and repetitive music playing when he walks away from his desk. After having to sit next to me playing Marine Sharpshooter last week, he says I can't complain any more. It's not the bamboo-shoots-under-the-nails audio torture of games like Hamtaro, for instance, but the repetitiveness and plinkiness of it all kept me looking over my shoulder to see who was watching Halloween for the seventh time.  The rest of the sound lacks a real sense of weight but still suffices to provide a little atmosphere and suspend your disbelief at least temporarily. Soon enough the other weaknesses of the game compel you to give up altogether.If a budget game can't get by on its own merits, it frequently makes up for this with a reasonably low price. But even the $20 sticker seems steep for CTU Marine Sharpshooter. The inclusion of spotter management had tremendous potential to help this game break out from an all too predictable formula. Sadly the poor AI and overall concept of the role simply turns your spotter in to a hostage that you have to protect.I'm hard-pressed to find a reason to recommend this title to anyone, marine sharpshooter or otherwise. I suppose it might make a good way to dissuade someone from actually joining the Marines, if that's your agenda, but that's about as far as this one's usefulness extends.", "date": "Apr 7, 2003"}
