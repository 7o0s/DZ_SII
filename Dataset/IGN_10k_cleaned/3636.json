{"name": "dothack 2: MUTATION", "name_review": ".hack//MUTATION (Part 2)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/05/05/hackmutation-part-2", "text": "With .hack//INFECTION (Part 1) appearing on store shelves a mere three months ago, it's difficult to speak of the second installment in overwhelming detail. Already given the four-page treatment back in February (the likes of which can be found here), .hack is still considered a new release by more than a few retailers, and it's hard to imagine that another could be on our doorstep so soon. And yet, despite the surrealism of it all, .hack//MUTATION (Part 2) is indeed upon us. Though for all intents and purposes, it's still pretty much the same game.   Then again that assessment isn't entirely fair. As publisher Bandai and developer Cyber Connect have made some bona fide attempts at expanding on MUTATION's scope by adding another selection to the two-servers available. Another dynamite plus is that the story has become a little less convoluted and it feels as though we're finally getting somewhere in terms of understanding what's going on. Accompanied by another 45-minute DVD as part of the package, MUTATION closes the book on several unanswered questions left behind by INFECTION. Of course, new problems and mysteries have arisen to leave us scratching our heads, but we suppose that's what the forthcoming OUTBREAK and QUARANTINE are meant for.   Gameplay  Should MUTATION end up being gamer's first exposure to the .hack series, the only thing we can say is to stop, go back, and play from the original. MUTATION offers no tutorial or teaching mode whatsoever, and after the complicated events of INFECTION could baffle the hell out of anyone who hasn't been through this before.    This fact is reinforced by the game's somewhat intricate inventory and trading systems that are definitely more text-heavy than your typical role-player. Since .hack is simulating the community of a Massively multiplayer online RPG known as ~The World~, there's a lot of NPC interaction, item swapping, and INFECTION references that could leave a lot of newbies playing shrug-shrug with their arms. The real-time/turn-based hybrid that the battle system presents isn't exactly a walk in the park either, especially when considering how confusing the freestyle camera is in the early going. That said, MUTATION can still be experienced by first-time players who accept the rather hefty learning curve -- they're just not going to get as much out of it as returning veterans.   Speaking of returning veterans, those who completed INFECTION can load their saves into MUTATION with the click of a button. Character levels, keywords, items, weapons, and Ryu Book stuff (the goodies unlocked by accomplishing certain tasks) are retained and implemented into Part 2 immediately. Additionally, the optional and secret characters discovered in Part 1 can be found in your address book and the Grunty you raised will come along with them. Should gamers start MUTATION without importing their save, however, they'll be given the same party that was assembled through plot-based events in INFECTION with a generic list of weapons and no secrets or bonuses whatsoever. If that's not a big enough reason to want to play through the first game beforehand, we don't know what is.   Regardless of whether you're new or seasoned though, .hack//MUTATION does offer a few things that the last version didn't. The most obvious of which is the all-new Lamda server that accompanies the always-open Delta and Theta destinations. Enemies and stages in Lamda are not only more difficult, but offer up several designs and landscapes that weren't previously seen in INFECTION. TNot to mention how welcome they are to explore after spending the last three months building our characters up across the same two servers.   Another big addition is the inclusion of five more characters to join your party: bolstering your squad of Long Arms, Heavy Axemen, Twin Blades, Wave Masters, Heavy Blades, and Blade Masters all the more. Some of them, like Nuke, Moonstone, and Wiseman are really cool, and make much more powerful companions than your buddies from the previous quest.   Naturally there's a bigger a list of rare items, sidequests, and everyday equipment that weren't available in Part 1 as well, and the new Grunty race mini-game and additional quests located in the older servers raise the fun factor even higher.    Unfortunately, the second game doesn't attempt to improve on any of the original's shortcomings. As the various stages of ~The World~ are plagued with some rather uneven balancing issues (even by typical MMORPG standards) and the enemy A.I. isn't very smart. Granted, there are over 400 different types of enemies, but their tactics aren't diverse enough to warrant a series of battles being more fun than any other. Too bad there weren't any true upgrades to the gameplay mechanics as the in-game message boards promise; it's all just a plot device.   Graphics  Identical in nearly every way to .hack//INFECTION, MUTATION utilizes the same great character designs by Evangelion genius, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto. Though the returning characters are completely unchanged, some of the newer personalities (such as Nuke) truly upped our appreciation for the game's unrelenting stylistic charm. Sure, the floor and wall textures aren't at the greatest resolution in the world and some of the monsters are a little bland when compared to the protagonists, but there's so much color and distinctiveness to ~The World~ that we don't notice very often.   One aspect we did notice, however, is the still-problematic camera. Controlled via the shoulder buttons and the right analog stick, the freestyle setup offers tons of flexibility and customization -- but with the constantly changing directions of both your own characters and enemy targets, getting it to work properly isn't exactly easy. We were hopeful that the setup would be smarter and more responsive in Part 2, but sadly it isn't. Even the oft-dissected Kingdom Hearts vantage point offered better response than this; and for those of us who've played with it; that's saying a lot.   Sound  We were fans of INFECTION's score and remain so with MUTATION. Disappointing, as it is to learn that there's little new music short of the Lamda server, the melodious piano and oboe themes were still brawny enough to convince us that we needed to buy the soundtrack sometime in the near future. Also strong is .hack's performance through surround sound receivers and speakers; it may not have the greatest positioning in the world, but it's clean and extremely clear. Especially since incorporating Dolby Digital for this installment.   Just as INFECTION offered, MUTATION allows gamers to listen to the storyline in either English or Japanese, and though the Japanese voices are stronger in comparison, .hack offers up one of those rare instances of a surprisingly strong dub performance from its American actors. Be careful who you repeat that too though, news of such could trigger rumors of the apocalypse. .hack//MUTATION is in many ways a superior game to the original. With it's added server, new characters, extra items, and other such goodies, returning fans are going to go crazy over their added possibilities. On the flipside, MUTATION doesn't quite capture the same sense of discovery and originality that Part 1 had, and we'd be lying if we said the shunning of the first game's problems didn't bother us a teeny bit. Part 2 isn't as user-friendly for beginners either, since it instantly thrusts its players into ~The World~ without so much of an explanation for what to do.Gripes aside, .hack//MUTATION is still quite the satisfying adventure. With its compelling storyline, interesting approach to the online MMORPG community, and two more games to follow in August and November respectfully, it's hard not to latch onto this one and ride it out 'til the end. Recommended for returning players almost exclusively, MUTATION is still good enough to advise the rest of you to check out the first game in preparation. See you again in three months!", "date": "May 5, 2003"}
