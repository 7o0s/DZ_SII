Let me see a show of hands. Nobody? Alright, so most normal people (read: non-IGN staff) can go about their lives without resorting to heretofore unheard of levels of violence, but that's the kind of game series Condemned is. It's the ends justifying the utterly blood-sodden means. It's a game about a drunken jerk who kills his way through junkies and monsters to stop a serial killer who has a thing for severing heads and ripping people up. Not exactly the happiest premise, really.   Of course, it does provide plenty of gameplay meat to gnaw on along the way, and Condemned 2 (or Condemned 2: Bloodshot, if you're a yankee), sequel to one of the Xbox 360's most compelling launch titles, tries very hard to immerse you in a blend of David Fincher's 'Seven' and developer Monolith's own F.E.A.R. On the whole, it's scary, strange and very occasionally inventive for a game that sits in a very crowded genre of me-too horror FPSs.    Perhaps that's giving the game more credit that it deserves; by the end, the tension dissolves into fire-fights and oddball enemies instead of the carefully plotted and white-knuckled levels of the first game. The multiplayer is also a misfire too  but we'll tackle that stuff shortly.     Ex-agent Ethan Thomas, now homeless and milking an unhealthy affection for the little brown jug, returns to lead you through a hunt for Serial Killer X (SKX), who has seemingly returned to his regular pastime of creating gallons of gore, drawing eyes on walls and cutting off heads. With the government kicking him back into gear, the game begins with you learning the new two-armed fighting mechanics in a back alley cesspool.   The L and R triggers now throw your punches, slow and weighted, in succession. Pull them both at the same time and Ethan will block. Clicking in the right thumbstick activates a shunting kick that introduces your enemies to the floor if you hook their knees or back from behind. All up, it's a flexible combat system that improves on the original game's rather simplistic fisticuffs system. Of course, the real star of the combat system is the object-based melee attacks.    Like in past games, if it looks like it might make a good weapon, chances are you can grab it, swing it and spill some blood. We're talking about taking your traditional crowbars, pipes, planks of wood, claw hammers and steel bats and ramping it up some  into quirky and even darkly amusing territory. Ever hit a deformed man with a toilet seat? Or swung a pooltable ball at someone's face? That's just for starters. Every object has a series of performance ratings (speed, strength and so on) that determine how long it's going to withstand this kind of abuse before you're back to using your fists. This is all pulled from the original; this time however, the rating for each part of the objects (consisting of pluses, minuses and equals signs) has been refined slightly. Now each symbol has a strong and weak variant, giving you a few more points to take into consideration when choosing your tools of destruction.   The other side of the combat is the timing system, which we found to be a little unforgiving. You can smack a guy with a two-by-four, expecting him to swing around, reeling backwards, but instead he'll take the blow and immediately attack you with a nearly unblockable set of swings of his own.    I swear these guys make cameos in Rockstar's Manhunt.  The game does give you combos of your own to help balance things out a little. These gradually upgrade after successfully performing these a set number of times, and you can trigger slow-motion attacks and very impressive environmental finishers that dispatch your victim in style  heads through windows, in presses, neck breaking stomps and so on.   The forensic detective work, a clever but overly simplistic feature of the first game, has been fleshed out in the sequel. Holding down X brings up a radial menu (all the rage these days) of different device functions  camera, GPS, black light and sound detector. Each is mostly pretty self-explanatory, but the training wheels have come off and you're now prompted much less on what to do and how to do it. At times, you're retracing similar puzzles from the first, but added functions and some simple question/answer minigames keep this mode feeling fresh, relevant and well integrated. Plus, that black light effect is damned convincing.   Right. Let's talk about this crazy chase sequence, because it's a great example of where Condemned 2 gets it very right. Midway through the game, you're tromping through a fairly bland snowy night level. Eventually you make your way into the underside of an old wooden maintenance shack. Blood is pooled here and there, as are severed limbs and a few corpses. Really, it's all pretty much par for the course  until the thumping starts from above. Thumping and dragging. And then moaning.    Something is very wrong upstairs, you realise.     The game scripts some of the tightest action I've seen in a shooter outside of Half-Life 2 and Bioshock; turn the right (or wrong) corner and things can go very wrong very quickly. Ever played Dragon's Lair? You remember  it was that hand-animated, choose-the-right-path-or-die arcade game that came to every CD-based console throughout the mid-90s. In a lot of ways, Condemned 2 has more in common with this game than you might expect on the surface.    Anyway, back to the chase. If you make your way into the main shack, you eventually see through a crack in the wall a soldier clawing his way across the floor, bleeding heavily. Never a good sign. Press further and suddenly things become clear. Not only are you not alone, the serial killer you've been pursuing is the least of your troubles  seeing as a giant brown bear has just burst through rotting door and starts chasing you. Now, the game begins to take cues from active-time-events in other games, as you physically wind your way through hallways, through holes, between crates and into wall spaces as you try to escape. All the while, the game handles your physical presence in the world with startling accuracy. You really get the feeling that you're running on two legs and strafing means literally moving your legs from side to side. It's nice to play a shooter where you don't feel like you're rolling on a giant trackball the whole time, and you're more than just a giant disembodied head with a gun arm.   Oooh. Graphic. Nice. Sure it's gory, but it's in context - so obviously the OFLC had no qualms about letting this one through.  Watch out for other incredible moments where you tumble down stairs, take some big leaps and do some scripted climbing and grappling. All of this is woven into one of the most atmospheric and spatially-aware games since Bioshock. The ever-night, noir setting plays with light and dark; though sometimes the game can be too murky for its own good, the game's best levels are the ones that stay true to the original setting  the mean streets and rundown residences that made the first game a tense and claustrophobic experience throughout.   The character models and animations are mostly pretty decent  facial textures do vary in quality though, and I can't shake the feeling that Ethan's deathly-white face is more the result of some sort of run-in with a mound of baby powder than undiagnosed sorosis of the liver. Maybe he just really likes foundation. Who knows.   In some ways, some of the tension has been lost in the second game, mainly due to the later overemphasis on gunplay (which frankly is a cop-out in a game that goes a long way towards bucking the 'shooter' moniker). We also think the story is a muddled mess of somewhat rough acting and jumpy transitions. The script itself is surprisingly crisp, but the direction of the voice actors (including some notables who worked on the Metal Gear Solid series amongst others) means that a lot of personality and conviction is lost by B-grade delivery.   So much atmosphere. A lot of other developers could take a few notes from this game.  On the other hand, the length of the game has been upped significantly, giving you probably double the single-player game of the first. Of course, playing the game on anything higher than Normal difficulty will also see the length of your game greatly extended. Multiplayer has been included  but honestly, it all feels a little bit tacked on. There are four different modes  your standard deathmatch variants and two more interesting game types  Bum Rush (agents versus bums) and Crime Scenes, where one team hides some evidence and the other must find it using forensic tools. Hey  it's not going to pull many away from their Halo 3 or COD4 jaunts, but it's an option and it's appreciated.  Condemned 2 falls apart at the end of the game; it steers itself too far into the choppy seas of silly science fiction, rather than keeping things balanced as it mostly is in the first few chapters of the game. That's the real problem; the game takes too many leaps into the fantastic, rather than keeping you grounded in much more dire, dark, familiar  and therefore more suspenseful  reality. The mechanics are 85 percent reliable, I'd say (though, I want to strangle the person who decided against a jump option)  but the combat can get a little clumsy and the sometimes unfair AI pulls down the final quality of the game. There are other little quirks too  the now-stunted taser, the inconsiderate auto-save function, the occasionally all-too-linear levels and obsession with making you take the long way around when you could just as easily kick some rubble out of the way and proceed.But that's Condemned 2 for you  unique to a fault. It's adventurous, dark, silly, and it'll keep you up at night whether you want it to or not.", "date": "Mar 28, 2008"}
