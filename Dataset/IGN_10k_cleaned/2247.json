Bringing a trick-based, combo heavy skateboarding game into 3D wasn't an easy task. But Activision and Neversoft pulled it off with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, which was first released for the PlayStation in September of 1999 and later in March of 2000 on the N64. Texas-based developer Edge of Reality was in charge of porting Neversoft's original THPS engine to the Nintendo 64, and because it did such a splendid job it was again chosen for sequel, THPS2. Just as we expected, Edge of Reality gave the N64 the best version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 it is capable of having. Fans of the series who didn't play it last year on Dreamcast and PlayStation will want to look into this one.    Features   Grind through 8 track locations including The Big Apple, Venice Beach, and The Bullring, Mexico  Avoid being a poser and choose from one of 13 pro skaters such as Steve Cabellero, Bucky Lasek, and Tony Hawk himself  Create-a-skater, customizing skin tone, clothing, shoes, boards, and more  Design your own skate park with a real-time 3D editor  Start a career and earn cash to improve player stats  Play with a friend competing in Trick Attack, Graffiti, or Horse mode  Save your career, custom created player, and skate parks to memory pak  Music credits include Anthrax & Chuck D.'s ~Bring the Noise,~ Rage Against the Machine's ~Guerilla Radio,~ and more   Expansion pak support    Gameplay When THPS first arrived on the N64 the fever was just reaching its high for the franchise due to its success on the PSX, so the little blue cartridge sold like hot cakes. Unfortunately this backfired a bit for Nintendo 64 owners because Activision decided to delay the arrival of the sequel, THPS2, to give the original more time to sell. In fact, until early in 2001 we weren't even aware it would arrive on the N64. This primed many to opt to purchase the PSX or Dreamcast version (which was and still is gorgeous). When it finally was officially announced for the N64 we were met with the sad news that it wouldn't even show its face on the console until late in 2001. So, here we stand almost a year after it was originally released and the uniquely yellow Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 cartridge has finally arrived. Was it worth the wait?   The Nintendo 64 version of the game has everything the title had on the other consoles. You can build your player stats in Career Mode by finishing level goals. Each level has 10 level goals and as opposed to the first THPS, you earn cash upon completion. You then use this cash to buy new stats for your character and open new levels. With a total of eight career levels and several more to boot, there's little to complain about. If you do choose to create your own skater you'll find all the options available for the PSX and Dreamcast versions. You can customize your name, place of birth, age, shirt, pants, shoes, face style, and a number of other options. It's an intuitive mode and anyone who decides to use it will have no trouble creating the ultimate poser.  When you get tired of skating levels such as Venice Beach and New York you can spend your time creating your own skate parks with a real-time 3D park editor. In this mode you can choose from four different themes including ~school,~ ~industrial,~ ~outdoor,~ and ~power plant.~ If you don't have the patience to build your own you can choose from 60 pre-made parks available for session skating, free rides and Two-player mode.   Speaking of the Two-player mode it is not dissimilar to THPS in that it runs with a lot of fogging and somewhat sacrificed framerate. You can face off against friends in Trick Attack, Graffiti, Horse, Tag, and Free Skate. We recommend Graffiti or Trick attack.  So, yes, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 has all its moves and modes that it has on other consoles, but has its gameplay stood up to the test of time. The PSX and Dreamcast saw THPS2 a year ago. Considering the facts, you don't want to pick up THPS2 for GameCube if you've played it on the PSX or DC. There's just no point to it. If you were a fan of the original, however, and have held out this long and only have an N64, it's a definite pick up. Otherwise it's best played on the Dreamcast.   Graphics The Hawkman graces the N64 courtesy of Edge of Reality. They're a talented bunch of folks and did a bang-up job with the original. As expected they brought some pretty clean texture work and a decent framerate to the Nintendo 64. It's not perfect by any means, though. There's a lot of draw-in, clipping, and texture seams but for an N64 title it's average. And given the gameplay, any visual artifacting is easily overlooked.   Sound Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 for the Nintendo 64 features a total of six songs. Oddly enough Edge of Reality has forgone MP3 technology for oddly cut-up tracks of the true songs. Songs like ~Bring the Noise~ are butchered into instrumentals and basically just the chorus. The other five songs follow the same pattern. The sound effects are just as varied as before only there are a lot more now. Whether you slam into a fence, pick up a subway coin, or kickflip over a bum the sound effect is appropriate. Given the N64 cartridge size, Edge of Reality did a decent job of giving N64 owners something to listen to.I actually was so addicted to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater that I bought a Dreamcast when it was released for Sega's little swirl-branded box. I figured I'd bite the bullet (knowing a price drop would come) and finally pick the system up. THPS2 played like a dream (pun intended), and was absolutely one of the best pieces of software on the market at the time. Above all, it was a stellar game among all ever created -- yes, it's that good. You'll notice I continue to say ~was,~ which is past tense. Does that mean it's not good a year later? Absolutely not, but Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, which promises to deliver a lot of new features, will be on the market in a few months. The truth is die-hard fans are better off buying a next-generation console than plopping down $60 for an N64 game. You can buy GameCube for another $140 dollars or another next-generation console and invest in the future. And if you get an Xbox you can have Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2X, which is an amazing version of the game. The sad fact is that the Nintendo 64 is history. However, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is a game you should no go without, especially if you enjoyed the original. If you don't own a Dreamcast, and you're not purchasing a next-generation console within the next year and you will actually still play your Nintendo 64 over the next few months then I suggest purchasing it. The fact is, THPS2 is still the best skateboarding game on the market. And the N64 version comes with the same addiction factor.", "date": "Nov 12, 2001"}
