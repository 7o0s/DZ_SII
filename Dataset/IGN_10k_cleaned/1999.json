The Wipeout games helped define how racers should be made for the PlayStation, by creating their own, unique worlds. G-Police also has its own world, one in which people live in giant domes on Callisto, a moon of Jupiter. A world where giant corporations wage war on each other. A world where police enforce the law from high in the air in heavily armed DASA-Kamov Havoc jet helicopters. What a world it is.  The look of the game is pure sci-fi, with a heavy emphasis on Blade Runner. The skyscrapers are always lit up, and giant billboards and neon signs are around every corner. The graphics are unfortunately the low-point of the game, with terrible background draw-in and polygon distortion on the buildings. The PlayStation, bless its two megs of RAM, just can't handle all that's required of it here. You can lower the frame rate to reduce draw-in somewhat, but it still doesn't improve it all the way.  However, the relatively poor graphics are more than made up for by the solid gameplay. Flying the Havoc takes some getting used to, though. There's a training mode to get you used to flying between buildings and hovering up and down, something you may not be used to from other games. Once mastered, flying the Havoc feels like second nature.  The majority of the game is involved in accomplishing missions for headquarters, such as locating and eliminating hostiles or protecting a convoy of friendlies. Other    missions include stopping a renegade    construction robot, preventing the import of    lethal arms, and quelling a riot. Riot foam    away!  With a flair for the dramatic, and an attention to detail that should impress even the toughest of critics, G-Police is a rock-solid example of great gameplay. Add this one to Psygnosis' list of winners.", "date": "Oct 17, 1997"}
