The trouble is, good looks seem to comprise the bulk of their reputation.  Expendable, for example, was very pretty, making it a benchmarking tool for 3D cards for some time, but as far as gameplay was concerned, it was essentially a very pretty remake of Super Contra. The UEFA Striker series was famous looker, but it's never held a candle to the FIFA or ISS series in any other area.  I approached Wild Wild Racing with expectations informed thus, assuming that I'd be playing a very pretty version of Buggy Heat.  The good news, though, is that this is a much better-designed game than most of its off-road competition, and Rage's graphical chops have resulted in something that looks a sight better than most of its competition on PS2 (not to mention that it maintains a perfect framerate, too).  If Ridge Racer is just a little too clean for your tastes, Wild Wild is a rougher alternative with just about as much going for it.  Graphics   Wow, this game is pretty.  Initially, it may come off as just a sharper update of a previous generation's dune-buggy games, but if you pay close attention, there are some very subtle animations and effects going on here.  The kit-car-style vehicles are all extremely well-modeled, with very detailed textures and subtle highlights, and the only complaint I have with their animation is just a slight stiffness to the movement of the front tires when you steer (although they look very good, picking up a coating of dirt from the road).  The suspension animation is amazing, especially how it complements the well-modeled terrain (more on that later), and since the engines are exposed, you can actually see those animating as well.  The drive chain moves around the crankshaft, and the flywheel spins up and down.  There may not be any fog effects obscuring the draw horizon, but there's some very cool colored smoke in the form of engine exhaust and dust kicked up by skidding turns.  The tracks have some excellent detail in the immediate backgrounds, but after seeing the amazing feats of scripting in games like Smuggler's Run and Moto GP, it's a little disappointing to see the terrain for just a short distance around you, beyond which point it fades or slopes away into a 2D background.  Most areas of any given course are designed such that you rarely see very far beyond you (there's usually an obstacle in the way), and when you do, it's towards a rather unassuming vista.  Nearby, though, there are often some realistic, good-looking backgrounds, like construction sites or other more complicated areas, and the framerate stays at a solid 60fps.  Sound  This is yet another racing game with generic techno in the background (a la Moto GP, as opposed to the inspired techno of a Ridge Racer or Wipeout), but at least the vehicle sound effects are good.  They vary according to your speed and revs, and you'll hear backfiring and transmission noises when you shift up or down.  There aren't many environmental sounds to speak of, but the grinding noise as you slide across dirt or gravel is definitely a highlight.  Gameplay  The key to sliding your way around Wild Wild Racing's lengthy courses is the handbrake turn, which lets you throw your buggy around sharp curves with ease.  The feel of the powerslides is balanced well - it's more smooth and even than the mechanical drifting in Ridge Racer, but it doesn't approach the simulation stiffness of something like Gran Turismo.  The learning curve on the handling system isn't unpleasantly steep, so it won't be long until you're drifting like a pro.  My one complaint about the vehicle behavior concerns the collisions, which occasionally knock you in inexplicable directions, but for the most part, your car interacts plausibly with the walls and other vehicles.  Though you'll get the hang of basic handling soon, the tracks gradually up the ante in the championship mode, by presenting you with gradually more and more complicated terrain.  Wild Wild Racing runs you through courses on a remarkable variety of different surfaces, and the detail of the track modeling interacts with the complex suspension physics of the vehicles to create a great feeling of interaction with the course.  Any given race will demand that you deal with several different terrain types in sequence, too.  India, for example, includes off-road hillclimbs, muddy construction sites, halfpipe-shaped concrete culverts, and ordinary flat highways.  On other tracks, you'll encounter mud, water, and ice, each of which demand a different driving response.  One element of progression that you have to get a handle on early is the alternation between the championship and challenge modes.  The former is a simple series of races, divided up into gradually more difficult classes.  The latter is more or less a requirement for success in the championship, though, because it's where you unlock more powerful cars.  Each stage of the challenge has three sub-stages, Quest, Skill, and Stunt.  In the first, you have to negotiate a track and hunt down a series of letters that spells the name of your new car - that unlocks the car.  In Skill, you have to perfect your vehicle control to knock a ball across the finish line of a special course - that unlocks a new engine for better characteristics.  In Stunt, you have to negotiate an obstacle course - completing that gives you one more boost to the vehicle's stats and opens up the next stage of the challenge, where you can go for a better car.  Some of the later challenges get ridiculously hard, but they do teach you how to control your car more effectively, and the Quest mode, though appallingly frustrating at times (the letters are often hidden in very out-of-the-way corners of the track), has the benefit of showing you where a lot of the shortcuts are in a course.  Generally, you have to beat the challenge before you can take on the equivalent stage of the championship - or at any rate, having that new car makes it much easier.  It also helps to remember lessons learned in the earlier rounds, because you'll take on similar courses in each successive championship.  The difference is that, as you move forward, the courses grow more and more open, with more complicated shortcuts and wider areas to roam around in.  The courses are pretty long to begin with (a typical race can run from three to four minutes even in the early stages), and they get even bigger as you go along. Wild Wild Racing sort of straddles the line between a track-based racer and something that's entirely free-roaming, like Smuggler's Run.  I suppose it's a little like SSX in that respect, although not to the same degree.  The funny thing is, though, that I'd rather play it than Smuggler's Run, because within its different context it actually comes off as less limited and repetitive.  Smuggler's has a ton of space to wander around in, but doesn't seem to do a lot with that potential, while Wild Wild Racing takes a step outside of its track-based model, adding some more depth and replayability to its already good-sized suite of tracks.And of course, it looks so prettttty...  Wild Wild isn't a ground-breaking racer, but what it's chosen to do, it does very well, and it's worth your attention if you need a slightly different species of speed at the PS2 launch.", "date": "Oct 25, 2000"}
