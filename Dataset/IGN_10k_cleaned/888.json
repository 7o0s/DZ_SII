{"name": "Vandal Hearts", "name_review": "Vandal Hearts", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/04/10/vandal-hearts", "text": "Surprisingly, Konami has entered the race for the ~Best RPG of the Year~ award. Not only has it entered once with Suikoden, but twice with Vandal Hearts. With role-playing games becoming more and more popular, Konami has definitely suppressed our appetite for Final Fantasy VII.  As opposed to a futuristic setting like Final Fantasy VII, Vandal Hearts takes place in a more medieval environment. From an overhead perspective, you'll lead Ash and his band  to victory through grueling battles filled with blood and drama. It's kind of like the movie ~Braveheart~ and Mortal Kombat mixed together.  Beside the so-so graphics, the game play is surprisingly smooth. During the battle sequences, you can zoom in and out of the field and rotate the map. This works especially well for enemies that are hiding behind trees or buildings. The war-engine itself is really fast and the lag time between turns isn't that annoying, unless you have a million enemies on the screen.   What's really cool is that you can mold your character to fit your strategic needs. For example, you can promote a 5th level Archer into a level 30 Sniper or 5th level Healer can study to become a high-level Priest. Some of your warriors can eventually turn into Birdmen, which increases the amount of steps you can take in a turn.  It's no secret, time-based games are hard to enjoy because they simply lack depth. Vandal Hearts on the other hand defies this stereotype. The story alone makes this game worth buying. With unexpected deaths and temporary alliances, this game definitely keeps you alert and on your feet.", "date": "Apr 10, 1997"}
