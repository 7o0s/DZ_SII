EA Mobile hopes to cash in on that unwavering dedication with the mobile release of NCAA Football 08, a go-go edition of their bestselling console football franchise. It's based on the football engine pioneered by JAMDAT for their series of successful NFL games prior to its acquisition by Electronic Arts.   If you played the old JAMDAT Sports NFL games, then you know NCAA Football 08 is based on a solid foundation. The game uses the same color-coded passing system where receivers assigned to the bottom tier of number keys (*, 0, and #) appear as red, yellow, or green. A green player is wide open. Passing to a red player is pointless. The playbook, a star feature is past football games, is also present. Scrolling between passing and running plays is easy. I also liked the ease of busting out offensive moves like jukes and stiff-arms when plowing down the field with the OK or 5 key.   The problem I had with NCAA Football's game play is that it's good, but dated. EA Mobile recently handed off a review build of their new Madden NFL 08 for mobile that offers a handful of improvements, such as making the passing entirely one-thumb. NCAA football 08 was released within just a couple weeks of Madden, so why aren't these excellent additions in here?   NCAA Football features 32 college teams, including many of the top teams like USC. Space dictated that some teams fell by the wayside, though, since EA Mobile included so much extra content for each team, such as a digitized fight song. When you select your home team, you essentially ~theme~ the game for that team. If you chose the Beavers, you'll hear that fight song on start-up and see Beaver trimmings all over the menu screens.   I reviewed the 3D edition of the game, which looked rock solid on a good BREW handset like the LG VX8100 (it's a Verizon handset). The animations are good, the visuals are clean, and the sound is impressive. However, just like the game mechanics, compared to EA Mobile's other new football release, NCAA Football 08 looks slightly aged. That game, dear friends, looks awesome.With the release of both Madden NFL 08 and NCAA Football 08, EA Mobile is still reaping the benefits of the JAMDAT acquisition. NCAA Football 08 uses many of the innovations pioneered by previous JAMDAT pigskin entries, such as passing and playbook navigation. However, even though NCAA is a good football game, it comes in the shadow of the superior Madden NFL 08. Unless you absolutely must play with college teams, I strongly recommend you download Madden instead.", "date": "Aug 20, 2007"}
