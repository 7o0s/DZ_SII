Vol.2//Reminisce Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/05/hackgu-vol2reminisce-review", "text": "If there's anything that makes the .hack series truly unique, it's the series' sequential approach to its games: where one game ends, the next in the series begins. There are no sequels in any of the .hack games because each one is a part of an over-arching storyline. And not only do the games follow in each other's footsteps, but you can take the data saved from the previous game and use it in the next, giving your characters a level and item advantage.  For .hack fans, the ability to deepen their exploration of the game while using their previous stats is part of the series' appeal. For the developers, this is a great way to get games out faster by using the same backgrounds and characters, and also improve on glitches found in a previous installment. Although Reminisce doesn't fix all the problems found in Rebirth, it does manage to improve things on a few fronts.   First, the story manages to gain a little more depth and breath. Continuing literally where Rebirth left off, Reminisce sees the main character Haseo growing both as a person and as a player. Gone is the rebel-without-a-clue, replaced by a more mature and considerate Haseo. No, he doesn't write poetry or talk about his feelings, but he's more willing to cooperate with other characters.       After a scary incident that takes place at the end of Rebirth, Haseo is more determined than ever to rid the online game known as ~The World~ of the malware virus AIDA. Along the way he makes new friends but also finds himself up against a few surprising enemies. From there the story takes quite a few twists and turns, but you'll have to play the game to know what those are.   The next improvement is the expansion of ~The World~. You're still able to fight in arena battles and help your guild out, but now thanks to a feature that lets you tune-up your steam bike, you can also participate new sidequests.      Speaking of tune-ups, the battle system also gets a bit of a spit shine. New skill triggers and a new Awakening mode are available thanks to Haseo's job extension. Now the former PKK sports a wickedly enormous scythe with moving teeth along its edges that allows him to attack several enemies at once. Even his Avatar gets an upgrade (though the Avatar battles are still nothing more than a glorified shooter mini game).    It's good to have friends. In addition all these online upgrades, there's a big new offline feature in the form of a card game. Called Crimson Vs., the game allows players to do battle against the computer with a deck of special cards. Since each round is done automatically, you can log into ~The World~ for a bit and come back later to see the results of each battle. It's mildly entertaining, but it's also a bit disappointing since you don't get any major prizes or unlockable features if you win a tournament. Therefore it's tempting to throw this feature into the ~pointless~ bin, right next to Avatar battles.   Since we're already on the subject of things that are pointless (this is where the game starts to go downhill by the way), this might be a good time to mention that there is way too much backtracking in Reminisce. You see, in order to advance certain parts of the storyline you must read an email telling you to go to a specific area, go to the area only to find out that you don't have what you need to access it, log out of the game to read a new email explaining what you need to do in order to access the area, log back in to go to a different area that has whatever you need for the first area, log back out to confirm you've done the right thing in the new area, then finally log back in to go to the area you wanted to go to in the first place. For some strange reason the makers of .hack//G.U. thought this would be fun, because this happens quite a few times in the G.U. series, and it gets old rather quickly. It's an inefficient way to move the story along and it takes away from valuable monster mashing time.   On top of this serious faux pas, Reminisce fails to fix what was wrong with the first game in G.U., which is the lack of online gameplay. There's far too many cutscenes where characters talk about their feelings, and not about what's going on in ~The World~. You still have to sift through pointless board threads in order to find key words or learn about the next stage of the game. Level grinding is still slow and tedious thanks to bland and repetitive dungeons (if you've transferred your save data from Rebirth you should already have HP and therefore can avoid some of this), and the battle camera is still wonky. This really hurts the game's score, since we want to play a game, not watch it or read about it.Even with solid voice acting, great music and improved controls, Reminisce doesn't solve the series' main problem, which is lack of online gameplay. It's important for a series as unique as this one to not just draw fans in but to give them incentive to continue on to the next game. Reminisce doesn't utterly fail to do that, but it doesn't do a steller job of it either.", "date": "Oct 5, 2007"}
