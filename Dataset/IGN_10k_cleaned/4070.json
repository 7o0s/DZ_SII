{"name": "SWAT: Global Strike Team", "name_review": "SWAT: Global Strike Team", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/28/swat-global-strike-team", "text": "is the first appearance of the popular SWAT franchise on home consoles, after several successful runs on the PC. Developed by Argonaut, SWAT:GST was initially going to be a bit of a twist on the old squad-based tactical shooter genre, but in the time since it was announced for PS2 and Xbox and it's recent arrival on those systems, other titles like SOCOM and Rainbow Six 3 have surpassed and improved on what SWAT: GST set out to do. SWAT is a first person shooter where you're able to issue commands to a pair of AI teammates either using the controller or voice-commands if you have a headset. This is the main hook for the single player game and the multiplayer options are limited to split-screen games only. The lack of features and the overall shallowness in terms of gameplay and visuals ultimately undercut a lot of the good ideas presented in SWAT: GST.  Gameplay  You play Mathias Kincaid the leader of a team of SWAT operatives with special global jurisdiction. Unrealistic? Sure, we're videogamers and we're not supposed to challenge the political validity of things like global elite police organizations. Anyway, as a police unit arresting enemies and protecting the public are central to your gameplay experience. The game's compliance system compels you to try to get a suspect --like a terrorist or bank robber-- to give up without getting shot so you can then handcuff them and move on. Hitting the compliance button or shouting ~SWAT: Drop your weapon~ into your headset will start a compliance meter going under your targeting reticule as long as you have the suspect targeted. You will see enemies drop their weapons, at which point you can either have one of your teammates cuff the baddies or you can move close enough and hit your action button to do it yourself. This in and of itself is pretty engaging and adds another layer of strategy to the standard ~kill everything that moves~ motivation that drives every other FPS. The downside is that this feature, like many of the others in the game, goes underutilized throughout the game.  Commanding your teammates is done using the D-pad where commands will pop up contextually when you're targeting an object that you can interact with. Looking at a door will bring up commands like breech, enter etc. You can select what you want your teammates to do by pressing the appropriate direction on the D-pad or simply say the command you want to issue if you have a headset. Teammates can 'cuff and stuff suspects once they've surrendered, disarm bombs and crack codes in computerized security locks with the press of a button. However, the game doesn't stay hectic enough, consistently enough where you'll have to master all of your command skills in the heat of battle. Too often a sequence will unfold where the gunfight will happen first and then whatever objectives in that particular area will be handled first. But your AI teammates are on their own and deadly accurate when it comes to engaging enemies, so firefights tend to be over quickly.  Also you don't have to do much thinking when it comes to deploying your mates.  For example, your demolition expert is the only one who can hack and disarm stuff so all you have to do is find the bomb or computer interface, hit the button and you're done. The only challenge here may be protecting him while he does his work. They always stick close to your side so there's not much threat of them getting smoked around the corner ahead or anything like that. Your teammates can be hurt but there's nothing stopping you from always being at the front of a firefight to protect them or anything. Your ability to manage them just doesn't affect the gameplay as much as it should.    You get bonuses and even medals for following the proper rules of engagement which means not killing innocents and not automatically blasting bad guys who aren't threatening you. That is, just because a terrorist is ready to blast doesn't mean you can shoot him without first giving him a chance to surrender. Shooting armed suspects in the back is also a good way to get bad pub for your global SWAT team. Some enemies have no intentions of ever surrendering so when you target them you'll see there's no compliance meter under your reticule. Similarly, after you've gotten a suspect to drop his weapon and put his hands up, if you take too long cuffing him, he'll eventually get his nerve back and reach down to pick up his gun again to shoot you. However, the game can very quickly boil down to a bulletfest since all you have to do is wait for an enemy --even one who's ready to wuss out-- to raise his gun at you so you can shoot him and not get penalized for excessive force.   It seems many of the cool ideas that are brought up in SWAT Global Strike Team are shortcircuited before they're fully explored. There's not enough of a threat from the enemy AI at any point to make executing various strategies risky. As long as your aim is true, you'll be finejust like in most first person shooters you've played in your life. SWAT suggests a step in another direction but we never quite get there.     The multiplayer elements of the game are similarly disappointing because beyond the two-player co-op game that has you going through similar but separate missions and levels from the single player game, there's not too much to be excited about. The omission of network and online play is a glaring weakness considering other games in the genre like the aforementioned SOCOM and Rainbow Six franchises hang their helmets on community gaming. Think about it this way: you have no reason to own a headset if you don't play games online through your Xbox or PS2, yet without a headset, SWAT:GST loses a huge percentage of its appeal with its voice recognition system. SWAT: GST is more interesting and fun with a headset, yet there's not enough in this game to warrant a purchase of a headset if you don't already have one for your library of online games; a library that most likely will already include a military shooter of some kind.  The co-operative play is a nice component to have, however. You don't get any advantages having played through the single player game, since the co-op missions are different than the solo missions even though they're in the same settings. You get a lot of different co-op and competitive game types but nothing that really stands out from the crowd. The time attack games have you trying to notch a certain number of kills, whether competitively or cooperatively in a certain amount of time for example, and this is mildly entertaining. It's just that knowing how games in this genre have evolved recently makes you wish SWAT was more of a complete package.   Graphics  SWAT Global Strike Team isn't showing off too much in terms of visuals, but the game does feature high quality light and shadows with lots of glowing bloom lighting and other special effects. Other than this character animation is below average and there are an awful lot of hallways and other confined spaces throughout the game. The textures in the game world are disappointing as well. With so many other disappointing visual elements, the lighting stands out as the only bright spot, literally.   The animation of the enemies is robotic and unnatural. If you're swift enough on your feet you can dodge and circle them to avoid their shots with relative ease. This is because the enemies have limited animation routines and even the most elaborate sequences --like a dodge roll-- aren't very impressive. The enemies will rotate around, whether standing or crouching, as if they had invisible rotation plates under their feet or magic dancing shoes like Michael Jackson had in the video for ~Billie Jean.~ In either case, it doesn't look right. Handcuffing bad buys and innocents probably should have been a little more dramatic in terms of animation as well considering how important it is to gameplay.    The biggest problem with the animation comes from the enemies and this overshadows a lot of the nice little touches. The weapon sway when moving includes an animation that shows the weapon being withdrawn from the screen when you get close to a wall or other solid object. He moves his gun out of the way when he gets close to something, which is cool, so it's hard to understand how so many other things go wrong. The shadows and intricate lighting are all very well done but unfortunately the environments being lit and cast in shadows are fairly dull.   Sound  There's a lot of information communicated through audio so it's a good thing that these elements are solid. The option of using your Xbox Live Communicator or SOCOM headset to issue voice commands is nice if you really want to immerse yourself in the game. It might help too since SWAT can get slow and empty at times.   The music is well done and all of the voice acting is adequate. The weapons sound effects are good, there just aren't that many of them. Enemies and innocents don't say much and your character only says things intended to gain compliance. Whether you're actually shouting ~SWAT! Drop your weapon!~ or pressing the button that says the same thing, you're going to hear this over and over again.   The surround sound applied in SWAT GST isn't anything too special and sounds from the environment don't factor too much into gameplay. You'll be able to hear where gunshots are coming from which is all you really need.  SWAT: GST just couldn't hold my attention mainly because I know there are better options out there when I want to play a military style, tactical shooter. The balance of teammate and enemy AI and mission structure just doesn't synch up well enough to keep me interested. The idea of having to manage two NPCs who can interact with the same environment that my character can is very appealing but it remains an unfulfilled promise in this game. The voice-recognition element is appealing but still not quite what it could be since managing your teammates isn't as crucial as I would like it to be. Whether you're shouting commands into a mic or pressing a button doesn't matter if the NPCs are too independent and powerful. SWAT:GST might be a nice holdover until you get one of the higher profile tactical, squad-based games on the way to both Xbox and PS2, but you have to really be an impatient gaming fiend to justify this purchase. It'll make for a pretty good rental, especially if you have a headset lying around.", "date": "Oct 28, 2003"}
