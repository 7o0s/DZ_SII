Scream Arena", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/25/monsters-inc-scream-arena", "text": "In the increasingly popular videogame industry publishers are fighting to get the most popular movie licenses, which in turn will help them sell a product. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's simply just a front to turn an otherwise frail gameplay idea into something sellable. So, it comes as no surprise that Monsters, Inc. Scream Arena from THQ is nothing more than basic dodgeball -- the kind you used to play in the schoolyard -- in a shiny Disney/Pixar package. It's clearly aimed at a very young audience, but the sheer simplicity and mindlessness of it is unforgivable. This is not a game for Disney fans, kids, or anyone. In fact, it's barely a game at all.    FeaturesPlay dodgeball in seven different arenas inspired from the movie  Six different gameplay styles  Choose from 13 different characters from the feature film  Unlock scenes from the movie as you open up new arenas  Multiple ball types have varying attributes  Four-player support  Jazzy soundtrack inspired by the movieGameplay  If you've seen the movie, you'll know that the monsters of Monsters, Inc. have had to come up with another source of power for their worlds -- something other than screams, shrills, and shrieks. For the purpose of the Radical Entertainment developed GameCube title, it turns out entertaining kids with dogeball is the way to do it. With that idea in hand, Monsters, Inc. Scream Arena was created. It's an entire game based solely around dodgeball -- throwing balls at other people.    It's very unsophisticated in design. You can choose from a total of 13 different characters (only five to start), which will be unlocked as you progress along through the seven different arenas in single player. Each arena, based on a scene from the Pixar film, comes with a total of five different objectives. Only when you complete them, which you have to do in a linear fashion, will you be able to move onto the next arena. Objectives include obtaining the most points from pure hits, hitting targets, holding onto a special ball for the longest, and more. To further mix things up there are a huge number of types of dodge balls that are fast, slow, sticky, and explosive, in addition to other creative ideas, such as the ~pet~ ball, which will follow you around until you want to use it and even return to you. On top of the single player mode, there is support for up to four players. The dynamic is slightly improved because there's actual interaction with other players in the room, but no matter what options there may be, it's still a very tiresome experience.   Essentially, this is all there is Scream Arena, which, by our calculations, is nothing. You are put in small environments to pick up a ball and throw it at your opponent. Dodgeball, a wild, active child's sport, while it may be entertaining in real life doesn't translate so well into a videogame. There is zero depth to it. You pick up a ball with the A or X button and toss it a certain distance depending on how long you hold down the A-button. You can also lob it with the X-button if you want to mix things up. You're also able to run in bursts with the B-button and, with the Big Red Ball, you can use the R and L trigger to block low and high shots.      The simple fact is, Scream Arena is mind-numbingly and laughably boring. For a much smaller investment, your children can go out and buy a big rubber ball to lunge at each other's bodies in the basement or front yard. The game is a blatant attempt to use a movie license to sell a product. Something like Monsters, Inc. Power Walking or Monsters, Inc. Sewing might be an appropriate sequel for mature (very mature) gamers. Dodgeball is, at best, a clever idea for a mini-game. Not an entire game.   Graphics  Radical Entertainment did put some effort into the visuals. It didn't exactly manage to come up with fur effects for Sully, the hairy star of Monsters, Inc., but there are some texture and lighting effects to spice things up. Self-shadowing and specular lighting effects give the otherwise low-polygon models some depth. Unfortunately, they animate so erratically and awkwardly, it takes away a lot from the attempt to make it look reminiscent of the sharp, critically acclaimed computer graphics flick from Pixar.    Sound  The sound, while not exactly the best we've heard, is a cut above the rest of the game. Each character comes with a handful of one-liner voice samples, which have been acted by most of the actors that were featured in the film. When you're choosing your character, these one-liners are welcomed. However, during the game you mostly hear lame screams and grunts from the characters as they get nailed with the ball.     In contrast to this, however, the soundtrack that overlays the action is splendid. For each arena there is a different jazz track, fully fleshed out redbook audio replete with bass, piano, sax, clarinet, and all the other big band instruments you'd hope to hear pulled together by a conductor. So, if you're a parent and want to dare a rental, the tunes are great. We don't think the kids will appreciate them so much, however.Despite its intention to be for children, Monsters, Inc. Scream Arena is not going to be appeal to any youngster that was born with some mental capacity. Dodgeball is boring, tedious, and lackluster in concept for videogame purposes. Why anyone would think that tossing balls at each other in a virtual world would be entertaining is beyond me. I don't think there's anything that Radical could have done to make the kids sport fun. It doesn't matter how many arenas or variations on throwing balls there is, it just isn't fun. Don't rent. Don't buy. Don't bother.", "date": "Sep 25, 2002"}
