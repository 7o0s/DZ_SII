I suggest you take a deep breath and wait, at least until you read this review.  Initially, Road Rash 3D is everything that one would expect Electronic Arts to do with the game. It's fully 3D (like the last versions that appeared on 3DO and Win '95), the characters are bigger, the tracks are interwoven and full of shortcuts, and the crash animation sequences are more generous. If you look at how the game has changed strictly based on the last game, it's definitely improved in many ways.  All of the aspects that make Road Rash the lovable chain-gang biker game that it is are all here also. Enemy AI is smarter and remembers you, and the AI also teams up in gangs, so instead of pissing off one guy with a grudge, you have a bunch of bikers looking for a good time at your expense. The roads themselves are cooler in at least one aspect: You can ride up on hills and sloped vertices to a greater extent than before, and you can go backward. Interaction between cars, obstacles, and your vehicle is also more improved (with a few exceptions), so that you might bounce off a car, but not bite it. Jumps off opponents, smashing into them, and long high jumps are all back with a different flair as well.  The vehicles are all different in speed and vary in look, feel, and abilities. And just like last time, you earn money by winning each race in order to buy new bikes to vie against faster, better equipped opponents. Some bikes perform far better in long straight stretches, while others are quicker, punchier, but better on the jump. In later stages, the bikes are extremely fast and challenging. And of course, the cops will come and shackle you if you're caught.  Musically, EA did a superb job of keeping the muscular, grungy taste that was so well performed by Sound Garden on the 3DO version up to par by signing up bands such as the Mermen, who slam out the surf-garage sound perfectly. The sound effects also are up to snuff, and your yelps after falling off your bike, as well as pedestrians howling, enemies growling, and your actual bike sounds are all cool.  But the reviewable version of Road Rash 3D we received, however, isn't a big leap from the previous game. To be honest, it's a huge disappointment. And this is coming from a fan of the series.  No matter what course you're on, there seems to be a graphic earthquake, in which every polygon is moving, regardless of whether it's a (stationery) post or stretch of dirt. The game makes you feel like you're in a 3D, polygonal environment, instead of immersing you. It's clear that Road Rash 3D isn't programmed as carefully or as cleanly as its predecessor, and you'll see and feel it when you play.  Control-wise -- it really all depends on which bike you choose -- but if you have played any of the previous Road Rash games, you'll feel right at home. Meaning that the control is based on an arcade model, with realism thrown in for balance, and (duh) realism. If you haven't played any other versions, there is a slight learning curve that isn't difficult, and you can choose from either analog or digital control, and obviously, analog is better. But the control isn't even a minor leap in feel, speed, or reaction time. In fact, the 3DO control was much tighter, and in this journalist's mind, better.  The other biggest disappointment is that you can not play in two-player mode. A representative at EA told IGN that because of the way the graphics are streamed off the disc, a two-player mode wasn't possible. Huh? Whatever! Road Rash without a two-player mode? That's truly a disappointment.  Finally, there is the expectation factor. Road Rash fans and racing fans in general have seen enormous leaps in both arcade and realistic racing games on many systems. With games such as Gran Turismo, with amazingly realistic physics, on the PlayStation, and even Need for Speed 3: Hot Pursuit, which looks and plays amazingly well (not to mention the crazy flips and arcade antics pulled off in Top Gear Rally and SF Rush on Nintendo 64), why isn't Road Rash a phenomenally better game?   How long has this game been in development? Two, three years? Why doesn't this game ride super fast? Or even faster than the great 3DO version? Why isn't the collision detection better? Why isn't the control honed to perfection? Why isn't there a two-player mode, or even a four-player mode? This game simply forces me to turn on the 3DO version and play it to death again in hopes that EA, which can and does produce great games, will makes Road Rash the great game it should be.   For now, fans of Road Rash will probably buy this game, and feel a bite of anger and sadness, knowing how good it could have been. And for those who haven't ever played Road Rash, well, there are better motorcycle games out there.  A disgruntled Douglass Perry", "date": "Jun 12, 1998"}
