There are a few elements specific to this Lynx edition, but it's honestly nothing more than the ball and paddle game that sparked this whole market known as the videogame industry. Features Three difficulty levels One or two balls in play Two players on one system Available for purchase at https://songbird.atari.org For Atari Lynx  Ponx is a straight-forward game, with very little fanfare in terms of interface. Select one or two players, one or two balls, and you're off. The object of the game is to hit the ball with your paddle, returning it to the other side of the screen where your opponent (human or AI) controls his own paddle. Every hit on the paddle sends the ball back at a faster speed (and a different angle depending on where it hits). Get it passed the paddle and score a point. First to 10 points wins.  My main gripe with the game is with the computer A.I.  Ponx is restricted in control due to the Lynx's digital control pad. It's either up or down  unlike versions that used paddle controls for precise, analog controls. In other words, you push up or down, you travel up or down the screen at a constant rate. However, the computer has the luxury of analog control  if you watch his paddle, he'll follow the ball at varying speeds, something human players can't do. This is a handicap flaw that I just can't let slip by  both players, whether they're human or computer, should have the same control capabilities, and I cry foul for the computer having the advantage.  The addition of a second ball does a good job of shaking up the action, though I would liked to have seen more variations on the Pong idea  if only to give the game less of a ~shareware~ feel to it. The stereo effects of the ball bouncing back and fourth are, admittedly, rather neat. If you strap on the headphones you'll see what I mean. And the Lynx scaling hardware is put to minor use  the paddles zoom onto the playfield at the beginning of the match. It's not much, but it's a start. In all honesty, 40 bucks is a bit much to pay for a slightly updated game of Pong. But if you've still got batteries in your Lynx, you might want to inject a bit of new fun into it and support the efforts of a guy keeping a handheld legacy alive. What's more, the cartridge, while not burned on an official Lynx card, is professionally manufactured and won't make your Lynx collection awkwardly bulky like the Telegames EEPROM releases of a couple years ago. Ponx isn't going to set the handheld community afire, but it's good to see some people making steps to keep a bit of gaming history going.", "date": "Oct 14, 1999"}
