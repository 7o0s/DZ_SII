The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Adventure Game, based directly on the story of the book/movie, succeeds because it embraces author Douglas Adams' trademarked absolute absurdity. You have ugly aliens that read awful poetry, shape-shifting friends, and an alien ship called Heart of Gold. How can this not be a fun ride?   You play as Arthur Dent, the everyman hero sentenced to wander the universe after earth is destroyed. In order to survive your decidedly crap lot in life, you must interact with a cast of crazies and use the game's impressive number of objects with the most oddball ways possible. Nothing unfolds in a normal way in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Adventure Game, but if you are having difficulty getting around some of the game's most bizarre puzzles, you can invoke their solutions -- but at a cost to your points.   The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Adventure Game plays out like one of the PC adventure games of yesteryear, a sort of point-and-click affair with the pointing and clicking. You must use a menu of eight commands, such as talk and combine, to perform actions. It's a little clunky, but certainly useable.   The sheer size and scope of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Adventure Game is sure to impress and appease fans. You will travel from Arthur's house to a Vogon ship to the Zaphod's Heart of Gold. Developer TKO has stuffed almost 30 screens worth of playing field for exploration and considering the number of actions and puzzles that must be done, this is sure to take your a few hours to complete.   We appreciated how close the game sticks to the appearance of the movie. The cast is instantly recognizable and the locations have been ripped straight from the sets. The animation is decent; Arthur shuffles everywhere he goes. Unfortunately, the game is a little on the quiet side.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Adventure Game is a fantastic companion piece to the new movie. All of the characters and situations have been faithfully recreated for the smallest screen with an obvious reverence to Adams' taste of humor. Fans should not hesitate to download the game, it's a great ride.", "date": "Apr 29, 2005"}
