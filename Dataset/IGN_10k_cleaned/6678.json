Mr. Pants is just the titular character, a cult hero created by Rare, the development house responsible for some pretty major hits like Perfect Dark, Banjo-Kazooie, as well as the Xbox 360 launch title, Kameo. Mobile maker In-Fusio's deal with Microsoft Game Studios (which now owns Rare after a pricey buyout from Nintendo) granted them access to this puzzler, which was a minor hit on the Game Boy Advance.   Mr. Pants humbly requests that you clear a block-covered screen by placing a series of shapes he hands over into the mix. If you can fashion the shapes into rectangles of any dimension, they will vanish from the screen with a cute little audio flourish that I never really got tired of hearing. The game isn't as easy as just slapping down pieces to make rectangles -- the shapes are different colors and over overlap. These two final features lead to some downright devilish puzzle action in later stages. You can see three pieces ahead, so you have to plan your attack in advance, and there is the occasional element of trial-and-error that could certainly frustrate more than few gamers.   The game manages to make all of this extra-difficult by using a color palette that looks like somebody ate a whole crate of Pas Easter egg dye pellets and chased it with some milk of ipecac. The whole thing is a mess of day-glo colors that is designed to trick your eyes and make it harder to see puzzle solutions. That gets a little annoying, even if it does play into Mr. Pants' whismy.   It's Mr. Pants include three game play modes: Puzzle, Wipeout, and Marathon. Most gamers should start with Puzzle, as it offers a brief tutorial to help with the action, as well as a helpful hint here and there for when the going gets tough. Marathon is trickier, as the game gives you a huge board and then starts scribbling along the borders. As the game space shrinks, the challenge of clearing the blocks increases. Wipeout gives you a screen full of odd blocks that must be eliminated in under a specified time limit.   Now, is this any fun? That depends on your personal taste in puzzle games. If you like a more meticulous game where you have to sit there and try over and over to complete just one puzzle, then Mr. Pants should fit the bill. However, I can imagine a lot of gamers getting ultimately frustrated by this strict machine. It's one thing to botch a puzzle by making a silly mistake and seeing right away that you blew it. It's another to screw up a move and then not necessarily realize it until later on, and then you've wasted time. You start over, correct one mistake, but then hope against hope you don't make another since you cannot see all the pieces available for the board.  It's Mr. Pants is a tough puzzle game and ends up being one of those love-it or hate-it titles -- I cannot imagine anybody falling in the middle ground. As you can see, I am not one of the former. The game adds some artificial difficulty by setting up tough puzzles but limiting the number of pieces you can see. You have to keep trying the puzzle over and over, and after a while, it stops being any fun. That, and the game is hard on the eyes. Pass.", "date": "Mar 2, 2006"}
