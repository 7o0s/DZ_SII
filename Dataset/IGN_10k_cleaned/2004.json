As unexciting and visually stale as most pointclickers are, there are a lot of consumers who love these types of games mostly because there's not a whole lot of depth to this genre.  Anyone, hardcore veteran gamer to the scrubbiest mainstream consumer can jump into a pointclicker and immediately ~enjoy~ the game.  Enjoyment of this genre relies primarily on two ingredients: story and puzzles.  There's not a whole lot of action to sweat over so to keep the gamer entertained, the puzzles have to be both clever and challenging and the story definitely has to keep the player interested.  Stupid Invaders does a decent job of doing both although there's little reason why you would play the game again once you've finished the game.  The story line is quite simple - our five aliens have crash-landed on Earth and in order to repair their spacecraft, they take up residence in an abandoned house in suburbia enjoying the greatest pastime of every full-bellied American: watching TV.  Unfortunately, a rather sinister scientist, Dr. Sakarin, wants the quintet of aliens to occupy his favorite pastime: autopsies.  Thus he hires a rather shady character by the name of Bolok, to capture the group of aliens.  Throughout the game you'll play as every alien member in your quest of getting the remaining parts of the spaceship, all the while avoiding capture from the cold Bolok.  Each of the five aliens have their individual characteristics ranging from the dim-witted Bud, ~old man~ and whiny Gorgious, and the smart Etno, who reminds me a lot of Frazier.   As stated in the beginning, this is a poinclicker - you control a cursor over several colorful pre-rendered backdrops.  You use this cursor to interact with objects onscreen as well as point to locations to get your alien to move.  Basically, you'll go from one room to another, looking for new objects and specific devices to move.  A major portion of the puzzles requires you to combine two or more items together - for example, one of the very first puzzles involves Bud combining a plunger and some ~high tensile~ toilet paper together to create a climbing device in order for you to escape a locked room.  There's a lot of style and humor when solving these puzzles and while some of the puzzles are amusing, most of the puzzles aren't too hard and without the hilarious FMV sequences, this game would be completed within an hour.  While the puzzles of Stupid Invaders barely kept me interested, the large amount of FMV cut sequences had me rolling several times.  Being a two disc game, Stupid Invaders comes packed with lots of comedic FMV sequences, some of which are just plain wrong.  While not as disgustingly humorous as the sick comedy seen in Conker's Bad Fur Day, Stupid Invaders definitely walks the border; the game doesn't pull any punches when it comes to making fun of everything, whether it's raunchy defecation humor or poking fun at certain ~holiday~ icons.  The voices of all the characters are done with great style and comical wit that will surely entertain the cartoon fan in all of us.  As delightful and funny as Stupid Invaders is, the main flaw is the lack of replay value.  You can only play the game over and over again so much before all the funny sequences are memorized.  Furthermore, I'm not a huge fan of this genre for one major reason; there's little depth involved in these games.  The puzzles aren't that clever as they usually involve finding the right item for the right situation.  Still, there's something to be said about the laughs you get when you watch our Stupid Invaders in action.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Jun 29, 2001"}
