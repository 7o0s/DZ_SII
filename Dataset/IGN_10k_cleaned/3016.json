In its first year out, weve seen 3D racers, skaters, shooters and flyers. But probably the most difficult feat for any handheld game is translating the excitement and spirit of its source movie or TV show, so that the player really feels like theyve entered the world they know so well. Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring for the Game Boy Advance succeeds on many levels, but a few pestering gameplay issues keep it from being top dog. Features Play as Jerry or Tom Password save Only for Game Boy Advance Published by NewKidCo (the company behind the not so hot E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial and the surprisingly decent Muppets Pinball Mania) and developed by Cave Barn Studios (creators of the GBA oddity Urban Yeti), Tom and Jerry follows everyones favorite cat and mouse team, as they run amok in the home of a local Wizard. Jerrys gotten a magic ring (hence the title) stuck on his head, and spends the game looking for something to pry it off. Tom must track down his non-feline companion and protect him from the endless amounts of cats who want a free lunch. At least, this is what the game is supposed to be about (its based off last years video of the same name). What it ends up being is an old-school, beat-em-up in the vein of Final Fight or Double Dragon, with Tom or Jerry wailing on cats and rats with any weapons they can find, until an arrow appears, signaling its time to move on. And for the most part, this type of gameplay works quite well, though it would have been nice to have more chasing in the game, with Tom fleeing from rolling pianos and whatnot. I always found the Tom & Jerry cartoons to be both frantic and clever, and sadly this game has focused all on the former. I doubt the cartoons would have been as popular if they were just hours of Tom & Jerry smashing each others skulls with baseball bats against a stale backdrop. The game is also virtually identical regardless of which character you pick. Maybe  I'm a little spoiled by Ecks vs. Sever, but a little clever variation with how the two stories intertwined would have been nice. The graphics, especially the sprites themselves, are absolutely gorgeous. I  don't  think Ive ever seen such faithful pixilated renditions of cartoon characters. Tom walks like Tom, his paws and arms curled out in a ready-to-pounce position, and Jerry skips and sprints along exactly as he always has. When a bomb goes off in Jerrys face, you get the classic covered with soot silhouette with the blinking eyes, and when Tom gets doused with milk bottles, he actually looks grossed out as the liquid drips vividly down his torso. Enemies (with the exception of some of the bosses) also look wonderful, and move just as smoothly as the two protagonists. Backgrounds are nothing special, but theyre colorful and  don't  detract from the sprites. What brings the game down is the lack of variety in gameplay. Youll basically spend the hour it takes to beat this title hitting a cat, running away to get some distance, then hitting him two more times before moving onto the next cat. You meet different enemies as the levels progress, and some can be very amusing (when youre not attacking the sewer rats, theyre donning hats and canes and busting out in dance routines). But what games like Final Fight and Double Dragon had going for them was a solid variety in enemies, dramatic entrances, mini-bosses and perfect enemy placement along the level. When you came across a band of gangs hanging out at a corner, it seemed plausible that they were actually there before your entrance. In this game, it feels like someones just randomly shoveling cats into each room. You get one or two enemy types per level, with no variation, and since you must defeat them all before moving onto the next area, the game quickly becomes monotonous. Also, because of the large sprites (with Jerrys exception) and the surprisingly tiny levels (usually only about four or five screens wide), maneuvering around the enemies becomes rather difficult. Jerry and Tom seem to attack at about half the speed of their enemies, so even after you get a hit in, chances are the cat youre facing will take a cheap shot before you can run away. It also hurts the game that you cant do combo attacks; once you bop a cat, you have to run away for a second or two before the game will allow you to hit him again (if you stick around, hell just swat you back). And as I said before, having to constantly hit and run in such small areas usually means youll probably just run into another cat wholl knock you on the floor. The game is also unforgiving when it comes to actually hitting the enemies. Often youll find your character swinging a punch or a weapon but not contacting, because youre either too far away from the cats center, or youre not lined up with them vertically.  It's even worse with the bosses, who seem to have the tiniest of areas that actually connect with your attacks (I spent a good three or four minutes swiping at the bird boss before I realized how close I had to get to actually do damage). Weapons are fun, and youll see the levels littered with abundant bats, rakes and milk bottles. But  there's no apparent difference in the way they impact your enemies, other than slightly different animations. The bosses are particularly disappointing; to beat them, you just use the same attacks you did on the enemies that led up to them. No variation, no clever weaknesses. And a lot of the bosses (such as a woman bursting through the kitchen window to fight you on the counter tops) just  don't  make sense. Aside from all this, the games not bad. Its colorful, moves fast, the characters are fun to watch, and there are no major camera or screen problems. If there were more mid-level variation in enemies, a little more thought were put into the order in which you encounter things, and a lot more effort put into how your character fights, this game could have been a real sleeper hit. As it stands now, it feels like a very talented group of developers got rushed, and had to throw all their characters and animations into a box to meet a deadline. Its still worth picking up for your eight-year-olds birthday, but its a shame when you realize how close this game came to being something more.", "date": "Oct 7, 2002"}
