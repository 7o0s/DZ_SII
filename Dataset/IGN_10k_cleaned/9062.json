He's a balding, 35-year-old fat bloke with a penchant for green body stockings and mannerisms so camp they make Kenneth Williams look positively butch. Yet here we are about to review a game that features not only Tingle as the lead character, but a bunch of other misfits that look like they've escaped from Hyrule's mental asylum. But while Tingle's quirky charms certainly won't be for everyone, those willing to look past some of the game's underlying shortcomings - and there are many - will discover something of a unique, albeit flawed, DS title.   The story begins with Tingle playing host to a mysterious character called Uncle Rupee, who informs our green fairy-lover about a wonderful place called Rupeeland. According to Rupee (so-called, no doubt, because he has a Rupee for a head) it's a place where all Tingle's wildest dreams can come true - beautiful women, glorious food and more money than he can possibly count. But to enter this amazing place Tingle must first collect thousands of Rupees and 'donate' them to a pond on top of a tower. Bizarre, we know. The more Rupees you throw into the pool the taller the tower becomes, which enables Tingle to reach new areas by climbing to the top and gliding off using his famous red balloon.   The dungeons are extremely similar to those found in Zelda games.  Raising cash is a case of visiting the various different areas of Hyrule - including familiar Zelda territories such as Deku Forest and Lon Lon Meadows - and completing tasks for many of the land's residents. These quests range from finding a jeweler's daughter to collecting butterflies, and upon completion you're rewarded with a fat load of Rupees. To play Tingle feels a lot like a watered-downed version of the top-down Zelda titles and as such features puzzles, dungeons and side quests similar to those Link is tasked with. But while Link does so to save the world, Tingle is doing it for purely selfish means - to live the high life in Rupeeland. Remember, it's all about the Rupees.   That said, raising the cash isn't quite as easy as it sounds because everything in the game requires Rupees. For example, Tingle doesn't have a typical health bar - instead Rupees provide his energy and once he runs out of cash it's game over. Even speaking to other characters eats up money too because they only give provide vital information once you've crossed their palm with gems. However, what's slightly odd is that you're never told outright how much this or that information costs, instead forced to haggle with the people you meet using the game's somewhat flawed bartering system. After making an offer using the simple touch-screen calculator you're either given the info you need because the offer was ample enough, or you're left fuming because the amount was so puny they keep their lips sealed - but they take the cash anyway, just for the hell of it.   We'll leave it up to you to decide whether that's a woman or a man in drag.  Sealing a deal is therefore the result of complete guesswork, which can be frustrating to say the least. You could well end up paying 110 Rupees for something only worth 60, because your initial offer of 50 is rejected (and therefore the money is wasted) and you have to pay another 60 to get what you need. It wouldn't be so bad if there were enough Rupees to go round but to actually make progress in the game you need to throw increasing amounts of Rupees into the pond on top of the tower, so careless bartering severely hampers your progress.     What's more frustrating is that the reward system works in much the same way as buying info, so you have to name your price when you finally complete a mission. If it's too high you'll be asked to make a lower offer, but be warned - you only get a handful of attempts at aiming the right price and if every offer you make is too steep then you'll walk away with nothing.   Fail too often and you'll have to resort to other, often more long-winded ways of raising cash. These include mixing ingredients you find in levels - like fruit and veg from trees and items left behind by defeated enemies (more of which in a moment) - to make items that can be sold to villagers. This is all done via a short cooking mini-game that requires you to stir the ingredients around in a pot (using the stylus, naturally) until they're cooked. As the recipes become more complicated you're required to add more ingredients, which again results in more time spent just to keep your Rupee levels up. What's more, higher-priced recipes require rarer items that are often a chore to find, so the process of finding said items and then creating the recipes quickly becomes a tiresome bore. Not good considering it's something you're regularly forced to do in order to continue with your adventure.   Prepare to watch 1,000s of Rupees lobbed into the pool near Tingle's house.  Ah yes, defeating monsters. You're probably thinking Tingle doesn't look like much of a fighter and you'd be absolutely right. But rather than engaging in fisticuffs himself Tingle visits Bodyguard Salons scattered throughout each location to hire the help of a bodyguard. Here you have a choice of fighters to call on but, naturally, the tougher the bodyguard you want the more expensive they cost - which is yet another drain on your oh-so-limited supply of precious gems.   As for the fights themselves, they're somewhat bizarre. When you bump into a bad guy the battle kicks off inside what is best described as a cartoon-style cloud from which fists fly in every direction. At this point your bodyguard automatically runs in to help out; if they're fit and fresh they'll quickly win, leaving you to pick up whatever the enemy leaves behind. You can take on more than one enemy at a time too, by moving the 'fight cloud' over other nearby enemies using the D-pad. This is beneficial because you receive a higher reward to taking out more enemies but if you're bodyguard carks it midway through - they have a more traditional health bar made up of hearts - then you need to spend Rupees in order to revive them.   All in all fighting involves very little skill and it's really only necessary to collect cooking ingredients. Boss battles, on the other hand, are much more imaginative and each is different from the next. For example, the skeleton pirate is defeated in a Super Punch Out-style fistfight while the poisonous plant can only be beaten by letting it eat Tingle while holding poisonous mushrooms. These boss fights are definitely one of the highlights of the game but it's disappointing the battles throughout the rest of the game aren't so interesting. As it stands they offer only brief respite from the otherwise tedious combat swamping the majority of your adventure.   Boss fights are a joy and some of the most enjoyable we've played on DS.  But while all this adds up to sound like something of a disaster - the overly simple combat, flawed bartering mechanic and often tedious fetch quests - it's all held together by a wonderfully quirky storyline, bursting with Tim Burton-style characters, that somehow makes sense, in a warped, twisted way. After all, Tingle is a 35-year-old single bloke who believes he can get rich quick but in reality he has to struggle every step of the way and that struggle - or unfairness, dare we say - is carried over onto the player. In that respect it's one of only a handful of games that perfectly places the player in the shoes of the lead character, to the point where you experience the same feelings and frustrations Tingle feels during his quest. It's no excuse for what is essentially a flawed game but it makes it slightly easier to stomach.Tingle is a very strange game then, and not just because of the far-out plot and bizarre cast of characters. Theres no deny it can be irritating, depressing and positively unfair at times but equally it has an undeniable charm that helps overlook some its inherent flaws. Exploring familiar-yet-skewed Zelda locations and the superbly imaginative bosses are certainly a highlight, and concocting recipes is fun too. Plus theres Tingle himself, who is such a relentlessly cheerful idiot you cant help but want to see the adventure through to its climax. The problem is that to do so you have to suffer enormous frustration and if thats enough to turn you off then give Tingle a miss. However, if youre willing to persevere youll discover one of the DSs most curious and quirky titles to date.", "date": "Sep 19, 2007"}
