It's one of the most popular video games ever made, and for good reason -- it's still insanely addictive, even if you're played it for the last ten years. Atlas Mobile has now taken the classic block-busting game and converted it into a chance to win free stuff as Tetris Tournament For Prizes!, published by Blue Lava Wireless.  Features:  Head-to-head play 40 lines per game Practice option  If you don't know how to play Tetris by now, yer hopeless. It's just a simple game of arranging falling blocks of different shapes, trying to fill in lines. The more lines you can fill in with one fell swoop, the more points you get. Nailing four lines at once is called a tetris.  Tetris Tournament takes the never-ending puzzler and puts a cap on it. Each game ends when you either clear forty lines or when time expires. This keeps games from lasting hours on end, thumbs from going numb, and minutes-used from destroying your credit rating.  There is a Practice Mode in Tetris Tournament, which will prep you for the online contests. Because this is a race to complete forty lines, the goal is to fill and empty the screen as fast as possible by slamming pieces into place. Fortunately, the control is simple and solid -- you're only in trouble if you have bananahands.  Getting into an online game is easy. Winning it is another story. There are some seriously good tetrisheads out there. Rarely will the time expire, as you find yourself learning how to expertly slam pieces into place and stay ahead of the time limit. Each players has the exact same pieces, too -- so it's a completely even match-up.  The display is clean. It's certainly not the most attractive game of Tetris we've ever seen -- Blue Lava has that cornered -- but to get this thing online and moving fast, you understand the need for a simple, serviceable game screen.Tetris Tournament For Prizes! is one of my favorite of Atlas Mobile's online tournament games. (The other is Switchix For Prizes!) This is pure, classic Tetris -- but the heated competition adds another level of excitement to the simple block-tosser. Recommended to anybody who likes Tetris and free stuff -- which should be damn near everybody.", "date": "Feb 21, 2004"}
