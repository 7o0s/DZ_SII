{"name": "Last Blade", "name_review": "Last Blade", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/04/29/last-blade", "text": "If it's a fight you want, the NeoGeo Pocket Color is your ticket to a pummeling. In fact, there are so many fighters that the system is nearing brawling overload. There are literally dozens of these games Fatal Fury, Samurai Showdown, King Of Fighters, SNK vs. Capcom, Gals Fighters, the upcoming Megaman Battle and Fighters, Kung Food... Alright, not Kung Food, but I think you get the point -- there's a ton of these pocket fighters on this handheld.  And now, Last Blade. As you might expect, it features super-deformed characters, dual-color character graphics, a good sense of speed, tons of technique, lots of characters, special collecting functions, and a heavy sense of been-there, done that for your average NeoGeo Pocket player. But is that a bad thing? Features:  Based on the NeoGeo arcade game. Last Battle and Last Battle 2's storylines. Fast 2D fighting gameplay. Nine main characters and five hidden fighters. Story, Survival, Time Attack, Training, and other secret modes. Game Gallery to collect character images, story content, and open secrets. Link Cable play and Gallery Trading functions. For NeoGeo Pocket Color only.   If you have a box full of these NeoGeo pocket fighters (as we do, and as do many NeoGeo readers), you don't need this one over any other pocket fighter. Not many of us even remember the arcade, and even if you fell in love with that game, the Japanglish text in the Story mode and the confusing variety of characters won't do much to deepen your interest in Last Blade.  That said, it's a fine fighter in the tradition of SNK's vast line-up of 2D fighters and pocket conversions. The technical skill leap here is in the Repel and counterattack function. If you time a parry at just the right time, you can redirect an opponent's attack and turn their advance into a devastating reversed move.   Each fighter in the Last Blade tournament is different from the last, and the techniques fit each fighter well. While there are no wrestlers like SNK vs. Capcom's Zangeif, there is plenty of variety in the cast. The more pure brawlers fight without many special attacks, and their Repels are easier to do. Other fighters, including a wacky fisherman who relies on a turtle hidden in his knapsack for attacks, have techniques that are in some ways more akin to standard fight fare (projectiles, spinning charges), but these moves have arcs that may take practice before fight pros can add them to their repertoire. (And yes, there are plenty of cute chicks to battle as, although if that's what you're looking for, try Gals Fighters.)  The depth of this game is the real strength of Last Blade. In addition to the technically proficient fighting game, there's a Survival Mode (where you fight wave upon wave of opponents, and at the same time can bet points for certain challenges such as a 4-hit Combo) and a Time Attack mode that force gamers to play in totally different ways than the standard story mode. And if that's not enough, everything you do racks up points for the Gallery. You'd better take every challenge the Survival Mode offers you if you want to buy every secret in this game. After hours and hours of gameplay, I still haven't opened up all the secrets in this game. And while the storyline clues you open initially aren't much of a help, the secret modes that you unlock later in the game are truly awesome and open the game up for a lot of fun.Last Blade is a good game in a crowded field, and while it does stack up with the best of them, it ends up falling short because it just doesn't have the same charm and familiar characters that the bigger names in SNK's NeoGeo Pocket line-up do. It may be one of the most accurate fighters, but most of its innovations have been siphoned into Gals Fighters (which also has jumped a few programming hurdles and offers a less letterboxed screen and the fastest fighting gameplay on the system). However, the cast of fighters is deep, the game is fun, and the Gallery may take your entire lifetime to complete (it's like an Easter Egg Hunt in Chickentopia). You can't go wrong with Last Blade, but you could go even more right with SNK vs. Capcom and Gals Fighters. If you're still hungry for fistcakes after those two, dig into Last Blade.", "date": "Apr 29, 2000"}
