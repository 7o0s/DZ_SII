But just because a game was a moderate success back in the day doesn't necessarily mean that its classic status will make it a good game in today's market. Shamus is nearly identical to the game released in the Eighties, but that's not really a positive selling point. Features Four areas 128 rooms Bonus levels Password save For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  Shamus is a very basic formula, designed in the era of very basic formulas  wander through a massive map separated by individual screens swarming with suicidal, kamikaze robots. The object is to wipe out the robots before they touch you, and get from one exit to the other to continue through the maze. How? Shamus can shoot in eight directions, two shots at a time.   Some areas are blocked off by locks, and you'll have to find color-coded keys to open up these road blocks. There are more than four maps put together by 128 individual screens  but don't expect these levels to look any different. All of the screens follow the same, simple pathways  some have two exits, others have only one. But all of them are saturated in enemy sprites, whether you enter the room for the first time or backtrack through a previously exterminated room to find another route.  The problems of Shamus are few, but in a game with very little to begin with, that's a lot. First, the controls are downright horrible  you can't move and shoot at the same time, and that causes problems trying to run away from the enemy robots. To shoot, you have to hold the fire button and push in the direction you want the bullet to go  and your guy has to stand still to do it. Second, the game is incredibly monotonous. There's just not a lot of variety to the design to drive you forward through the game, since there's really no point other than shooting an endless wave of robots. The action is long and hard (saved by a password system), but in all honesty there wasn't enough incentive in Shamus to keep me going longer than a few plays.Shamus is a blatant clone of the classic Stern arcade game Berzerk, without the tight controls and maniacal pace. Heck, if you wait around too long in a level, the main bad guy The Shadow comes out to chase you into the next screen  shades of Evil Otto. The control problems are a real shame, but top that off with tedious level design and it's a game that's just not worth the effort. Granted, Shamus was created as a budget title  but so was Yars' Revenge, and that turned out a whole lot better.", "date": "Jun 3, 2000"}
