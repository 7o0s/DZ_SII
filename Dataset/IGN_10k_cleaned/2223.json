You've played Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX. So what extreme sport icon is left? Enter Mat Hoffman and his BMX...  Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX uses a slightly modified Tony Hawk engine, and by ~slightly modified~ we basically mean it's just like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 but replace the skateboard with a BMX. The camera angles, controls, and trick system is identical, but that's certainly not a bad thing considering that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is the ultimate extreme sports game on the PC.   While you can opt to ride around each course if you unlock them, the main core of the game is the Career mode. Like THPS2, each course has five goals or objectives to complete. You'll have to snag a certain number of magazine covers to progress to other courses. These challenges range from finding he letters to spell ~TRICK~ to pulling off enough tricks to claim the high score to recovering the hidden magazine cover.  It's not very realistic, but it's not supposed to be. You're a master BMX trickster, so 40-foot big airs and suicidal falls are all in a day's work for you.  What's not in a day's work is looking pretty. As Mat Hoffman is a console port, the visuals in the game aren't what we've come to expect out of modern PC games, and it actually looks like something out of the late 90s. The textures are blotchy and grainy and the character models are blocky. It looks a lot like the Dreamcast version, but not quite as crisp. On a high note, the animations are fluid and display a good sense of flinging your body around in spasmatic position while holding onto 30 pounds of steel and rubber.  The lacking visual quality wouldn't be so bad if the game ran at a decent rate on low-end systems. Don't let the PII266MHz minimum spec fool you.  Since this is a high-action kind of game, you'll need a much faster system than that to see Mat Hoffman ride smoothly, and I'd suggest at least a 600MHz machine with a decent 3D card to play Mat Hoffman at a respectable speed.  Graphics aside, it's Mat Hoffman's gameplay that makes it better than it's closest competitor -- Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX. While it's not as responsive as its console cousin, the controls in Mat Hoffman are solid and easy to execute, and anybody who has played THPS2 will be able to pick-up the game and start pulling off some amazing tricks right away. Like its skateboard-bound brother, you can pull off grinds and manuals in Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX, as well as fakies, bunnyhops, and a bevy of aerial tricks. The trick set is pretty varied, with a fair amount of differences from rider to rider, and each one has a lot of individuality just in his basic tricks as well as in their special signature moves. The sense of speed -- something that was lacking in Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX -- is up to par in Mat Hoffman, keeping the action intense and the motion fluid. Unfortunately, there are a few bugs in the game which hamper the motion, like starting sideways halfway up the side of a pole or getting stuck in a corner. This particular problem is only exacerbated by the fact that the camera has a tendency to go into an epileptic fit when you get stuck in a corner, shaking and vibrating wildly until you eventually bunnyhop your way out of the situation.  Level design is brilliant in some stages and lacking in others. Like the console folks, I wasn't very impressed with the New York level, as it felt too open and sparse, making it difficult to string tricks together. Some of the levels, like La Habra and the Treatment Plant, make up for it with plenty of chances to combine your tricks for mega-scores.  As we've come to expect from these types of games, Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX sports an impressive line-up of ska, punk, and hip-hop bands which fit the onscreen action perfectly. Bands such as Jurassic 5, The Stone Roses, Bad Brains, Pennywise, and Outkast.  And old-school punks like myself will be glad to hear Agent Orange's Everything Turns Grey pumping while pulling a few Indian Air seat grabs. Unfortunately, the sound effects are canned and repetitive, and the guttural groan that accompanies bails quickly becomes annoying.  While there's a lot to unlock in the single-player game, from advances areas to secret riders (including an old friend who you may have seen in another game *hint, hint*), if you unlock everything there are a couple of multiplayer options to play around with, even though they're kind of lame since only two people can play at the same computer or over a LAN. There's no Internet option at all.  You can also squeeze a few extra hours out of the park editor, which is pretty easy to work with, especially if you've used the park editor in Tony Hawk.    As you can tell from the review, Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX is a mixed bag. While the action can be intense at times, the bugs make the game more frustrating than it has to be. It's no Tony Hawk, but it'll prove fun for those of you looking for a little big air while you're waiting for THPS 3.  -- Tal Blevins      Want to share your opinions with the world?
