Why pay $50 for the interactive version when you can get the paper version for $10? The only real advantage to having it in electronic form is that you're not dependent on finding human opponents -- you can play against the computer anytime you wish. So, working off that logic, the computer AI would have to be the most important part of any board game port. Sure, graphics and interface are important as well, but it's the AI that will really make the game worth the extra $40. Monopoly for the PlayStation has terrible AI.  I admit it's a little over-dramatic of me to just blurt that out and not qualify it. But I'll get to that later. First, I want to talk about a few other things that could've been done better in the game.  First off, the interface is unnecessarily complex. Monopoly is a point and click game and absolutely screams for an intuitive interface. It's not that it's slow -- it's quite speedy. And, after you hook up your PlayStation mouse (if you actually own one) you're clicking along just fine. But the interface! Nothing is ever really clear, and there are tons of extra steps that could've been done away with. For example, when bidding for property you tell the computer you want to make a bid. Then it asks you again. While this in itself isn't so bad, imagine having to do this all the time, and you're starting to get the point.  Secondly, a lot of what happens in the game isn't clear, or happens too quickly to keep track of. When the computer buys a property, it never states that it's been purchased. You have to look at its money total to see if it's gone down. Also, when the computer offers to buy property from you, it doesn't say what the property is, or its value. This failure to state value occurs when bidding as well. You have to make sure you catch a glimpse of the value before the screens change so you don't over-bid.  All right, let's get back to that pesky AI. There are 10 different computer opponents to choose to play against, ranging in intelligence and caution levels, that being how careful that player is in regard to purchases and trading. However, the fundamental AI in the game is so flawed that it will let you buy property, a basic aspect of the game, for much less than its value. When you land on a property for sale, bid for it instead of paying full value. You'll be able to pick it up for less than half the price on most occasions. If the opponent doesn't bother to bid against you, you can grab it up for $1! The computer opponent will almost always pay full price. Was this game even play tested?  So there you go. While it may seem cool to be able to cheat at Monopoly, where's the fun if you always win? If Hasbro Interactive wants to make a name for itself in the PlayStation market, it needs to make some good games. After three bad titles (Frogger, Beast Wars Transformers, and Monopoly), gamers are going to catch on that Hasbro Interactive is a name to avoid. And nobody wants that.
