The sales totaling into the millions and growing every day say you haven't. Activision agrees. In 2007 alone we've already seen Guitar Hero 2 release on Xbox 360 and Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the '80s on PS2, but that hasn't stopped the demand for more. Enter Guitar Hero 3, the first in the franchise made by development studio Neversoft after the former team, Harmonix, was snatched up by MTV Games. You can toss out any fears you might have had about a new developer ruining your favorite franchise right now. Guitar Hero 3 is another great reason to slip into some tight leather pants and rock out with your friends.   For music rhythm games, it often begins and ends with the soundtrack. Guitar Hero 3 has nothing to worry about. From top to bottom, this is easily the best lineup yet. Metallica, The Rolling Stones, Slayer, Iron Maiden, Aerosmith and more are all in with master recordings no less. Activision even got the Sex Pistols to re-record Anarchy in the UK just for the game. The same goes for Living Colour's Cult of Personality. The songs that were performed by cover bands, as usual, don't live up to the originals but there are less of them than ever before. This time, when you start up a Guns n' Roses track (Welcome to the Jungle), it will be Axl Rose belting out the words to accompany your shredding. And that makes all the difference in the world.   It's hard not to like this game.  Unlike Rocks the '80s, this is indeed a full sequel. The list of additions reads like a wishlist compiled from fans across the world. A full cooperative career has finally been added, complete with its own songs picked specifically for their great bass or rhythm guitar parts. A battle mode is in as well, inspired in part by the Ralph Macchio movie Crossroads, where players duel against each other by throwing attacks at each other in an attempt to make one another miss notes and fail out. We've had a great deal of fun with this new way to go head to head with a friend. It may sound a bit odd, but don't write it off.   For the first time, the franchise goes online with co-op, face-off, pro face-off and battle mode up for play with a friend or stranger around the world. The PC version includes a open match list for browsing, quick match, and the ability to create a private match. To play with a specific friend, you'll either have to find them first on the public match list or know their handle to search for the private match after they have created it. There isn't any friend list, which is a bit of a disappointment. There's also a bit of an issue with people having poor connections online, making it a little difficult for us to find a match that we could even join. Once you're in, though, the game runs smoothly.   One thing the PC version doesn't have (yet?) is access to the guitarhero.com online community. This web tool, that pools stats and organizes tournaments from the Wii, PS3, and 360 titles, is a great addition and sorely missed on PC.   The new wireless Les Paul that comes with the PS3, 360, and Wii versions of Guitar Hero 3 doesn't work with the PC. Instead, you'll get the X-Plorer design that came with Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360. This isn't nearly as good as the new Les Paul with a less than ideal button layout and a wired connection. PC gamers aren't completely ignored when it comes to new controls. You can also play the game with the keyboard. It isn't the most ideal way to play Guitar Hero 3, but it is fully customizable and functionalif you can stand the constant tapping.   Even us simple folk can be stars. Then there are the licensed legends. Slash, of Guns n' Roses fame, is in the game as a playable character. So is Tom Morello and a few other imaginary avatars, but we'll say it again: You can play as Slash in Guitar Hero 3. If you don't think that's cool then there is something wrong with you.   Guitar Hero 3 was built from the ground up by Neversoft without access to any of the code from the first two games and was then ported to the PC by Aspyr. The work done to ensure the game plays like its predecessors is admirable, but this title does play a tad different than what you're probably used to if you've been following the series closely. For starters, the window of time in which you can successfully hit a note has been extended by quite a bit. Guitar Hero experts may see this as blasphemy because of how much easier it makes the game, but this was actually a great move by Neversoft. The difficulty on the lower tier songs has been reduced, making the game much more accessible to new players. It also makes it so that intermediate players can feel like a rock star right from the get go, a feeling that really is the entire point of playing the game.    There isn't any need to worry that the game has been made too simple. In fact, the songs that come towards the end of the campaign are the most difficult we've played yet. Even with a bigger window to hit the notes, most will find themselves with a huge challenge. Songs like Metallica's One and Slayer's Raining Blood are ridiculously hard on the expert difficultly. If you can beat Dragonforce's Through Fire and Flames on expert than you have our utmost respect.   The challenge has been put in largely through a new approach to how the scrolling notes are laid out. Quick changes between two and three note chords are now the status quo. There's also a greater emphasis on strings of notes that can be played with hammer-ons and pull-offs, a technique that allows you to play notes without strumming. It's a bit different than what we're used to, but the notes are laid out well enough that nearly every song is fun to play.       Hammer-ons and pull-offs are present in full force. While the songs are a blast to play, most everything around the game could use some work. The character models have been given a new art direction and its one that we're not particularly fond of. Although a lot of motion capturing was done to get the signature moves of Slash and Bret Michaels, as well as to nail the singing animations, the way the band and crowd move just doesn't feel like rock and roll. All of the motions are stiff with the drummer as the most animatronic of them all.   The visual work on PC is largely comparable to what you get on the PS3 and 360. The option is there to boost the resolution, but you'll never get a game that really looks fantastic. The one thing potential owners should note is that the minimum system specs are a bit high on Guitar Hero 3, so dreams of it running on your somewhat old laptop might not come true. We tried running the game on a single core machine and it didn't hold up too well with prevalent slowdown. Make sure you check your specs against the minimum requirements before you rush out to the store.   The standard campaign mode has only been slightly tweaked for Guitar Hero 3. The game still plays as a list of songs broken into tiers with a surprise encore at the end of each one. It's about time for an overhaul -- this presentation is feeling dated at this point in the series' life. The small addition comes in the form of three boss ~fights~ that make use of the new battle mode. Each one has a track recorded just for Guitar Hero 3 and they're all great fun. This is one feature we'd love to see fleshed out in the future.   Little vignettes have also been added between each tier. They're a decent addition and nice to watch, but they also highlight a facet of the game we could do without. One of the little scenes shows the band getting upset at accusations that they've sold out. That's fine, except that Activision clearly sold Guitar Hero out in every way it could. The story is rather hypocritical. Ads are fed into the game, an entire stage was sold to Pontiac, and there is even an Axe Body Spray guitar. Sponsorships are nothing new in the Guitar Hero franchise, but in the past they were kept strictly to music related brands. These are the sort of ads that don't bring anything to the game and really have no place. Not cool. Not cool at all.    We want a real Jimi -- not this knock-off. With all that has been added, there is still a lot missing. The fact that you can't play the co-op career online is a big oversight. Several songs can only be unlocked by playing this mode so you'll have to get a friend over with another guitar (or controller, blech) if you want them. You also can't play the co-op mode in a quickly fashion. The three boss battle tunes you play in the career mode also can't be tackled outside of that mode. How cool would it be to play The Devil Went Down to Georgia against a friend in a battle? The co-op quickplay and boss battle battle gripses were patched on the Xbox 360 and PS3, but no patches have been released as of yet for the PC.   This lack of patches raises an interesting point for the PC version. Patches, it seems, start first on the consoles. We assume they'll make it to the PC version eventually, but who knows? It's an odd day when the PC versions of games wait on patches. There also is no downloadable content ready for Guitar Hero 3 on PC, though the PS3 and 360 already have some up for purchase. Worries over the tracks being pirated on the PC may be holding this up. So while gamers on PC might not get the full benefit of downloadable content that the console owners get, they likely will get some extra content through more illegal channels.   With online play in the mix, the lack of a character editor becomes much more noticeable when you continuously run into the same small set of avatars. The tag line to the game is Legends of Rock, yet there are only two legends in the game that you can play as -- Slash and Tom Morello. Bret Michaels is in the game too, but he hardly qualifies as a legend. As cool as it is being Slash, and it is very cool, it seems that the game could have drastically benefited from either licensing more rock icons or including a character editor so that the players could create their own legendary rockers.Now that Harmonix has moved on, Guitar Hero 3 is a safe first entry into the franchise by the new management. The group didn't rock the boat too much and stuck with the tried and true formula of previous Guitar Hero games in most situations. The soundtrack is fantastic and the new online additions are going to take the Guitar Hero community to the next level. The lack of guitarhero.com features on the PC are a disappointment, though. It really is hard to argue with any facet of the gameplay. Everything outside of the game itself, though, is in need of an overhaul as the presentation is growing a bit stale. It's hard to ask that of a first foray into an established franchise, but it's equally hard to look at the game and not see room for improvement.  Everyone got it right where it counts, though, and the third entry into the Guitar Hero franchise is just as fun as ever.", "date": "Nov 14, 2007"}
