Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/09/13/rengoku-ii-the-stairway-to-heaven-review", "text": "Last year, Konami and Hudson Soft released Rengoku: The Tower of Purgatory, a title criticized for its lackluster level design, an unbalanced battle system and a questionable control scheme.  Considering the creative post-apocalyptic setting for the game and art style by renowned manga artist Jun Suemi, the game was definitely expected to be a better title, so when the sequel was announced, the hope was that the follow up would erase the negative reception for the series.  Unfortunately, while a few things have been changed in its favor, the essential gameplay with its significant flaws remains the same, making Rengoku II: The Stairway to H.E.A.V.E.N almost a carbon copy of its predecessor.   The story of Rengoku II is set far in the future, where Earth has been devastated by war.  To fight these massive battles against each other, humans created A.D.A.M. units (or Autonomous Dueling Armed Machines) to be the ultimate weapon.  Surprisingly, these units were all too good at their job, and managed to eliminate the need for warfare entirely.  However, these effective killing machines still existed, so instead of destroying their inventions, humanity did the next best thing and created a kind of cybernetic bloodsport.  Sealing the A.D.A.M. units away in massive Rengoku Towers, the units were able to continually wage war against each other while humans watched. However, thanks to the perpetual combat, a strange accident has occurred to one of these units: players take on the role of a newly self-aware A.D.A.M. unit that seeks to fight its way out of the tower and discover what it once was.   Look out -- pink robots are deadly when provoked. As far as fighting is concerned, your A.D.A.M. will be able to equip any weapon or item that you scavenge off the bodies of your opponents, or that you find by destroying environmental objects, such as boxes and debris. Each item can be assigned to one of four areas of the body - the head, torso and both arms, which correspond to the four face buttons on the PSP.  Although equipping the various weapons gives your character four different ways to attack enemies (with more than 300 separate weapons or items to choose from), there's a definite caveat to this system.  You need to continually use weapons to power up your character's skills, but these weapons can't be used in combat forever; constantly relying on one part of the body will cause it to overheat, rendering it inoperable.  What's more, each one has a specific number of uses before they stop working.  Once this happens, you're forced to return to hand to hand combat.     Speaking of combat, only two adjustments have been made to the battle system from the last game. Players can now strafe while firing their weapons, which definitely helps when you're facing two or more opponents in a room.  Players can also choose to use the analog nub to control their characters. Since these are the only changes, the game still suffers from a number of battle flaws.  Combos, which the game claims are the best ways to maximize your damage, are still extremely difficult to pull off simply because the game has an innate lag whenever you switch to a different weapon.  Consequently, you may try to chain together certain attacks, such as a shotgun blast to a machine gun to a chainsaw attack, but you'll find that having to wait for the extra second or two gives many of your foes time enough to break the combo entirely.  In fact, the only time that you can try to do an uninterrupted combo is an overkill, where the enemy is already dead and you're pummeling its body for any potential weapons or items you can find.   Please run into the light...Please! This is when you manage to defeat your opponents.  The notoriously imbalanced play from the first Rengoku makes a return appearance in the sequel, which literally eliminates the need for tactics in favor of button mashing and finger crossing.  Inevitably, as you move from one section of the tower to the next, you'll discover that the weaponry of your enemies will far surpass the ones that you have.  Whether it happens to be flamethrowers, homing missiles or some other piece of equipment, it's extremely easy for some group of enemies to take you down, especially since the rooms you enter lock their doors as soon as combat starts.  What makes this worse is that any time you die, you immediately lose all of your weapons, so any of the powered up arms that you might have had are instantly left behind where you died.  This leaves you with much weaker weapons that won't cause as much damage or last as long, which can lead to you dying again and again.  More often than not, it's worth it to lose your progress and return to a previous save if you wind up dying than go through this painful process of starting over from scratch.    The only way to save your game is to reach a terminal at the start of the tower level. Terminals are the key to your survival because they also allow you to upgrade your character.  By collecting Elixir Skin from fallen opponents or by melting down unused weapons and items, you can receive points that you can use to upgrade your A.D.A.M.'s health, heat resistance to overheating, and even increase the number of weapons that can be equipped in an area of the body.  This lets you immediately have a replacement available to your character when an item stops working, letting you remain dangerous in battle much longer. While it's a creative system, the Elixir Skin trading is somewhat skewed.  For one, you need to collect a lot of it to redeem at terminals for one upgrade, and the next successive ones get exponentially higher and higher.  Depending on how necessary the upgrade is (and for the most part, you'll always need to upgrade something) you'll find yourself scavenging for every item and weapon you can get.  Considering that you won't always receive items (in fact, it's possible to go through a series of battles without uncovering a single thing), you may find yourself strapped for equipment.   Something else that's rather strapped is the storyline itself.  While the opening movie and cutscenes are impressive, the remainder of the game is extremely sparse.  It's obvious that the game is still trying to hold onto its literary roots based off Dante's Divine Comedy, such as references to guides Beatrice and Virgil, and bosses that mention their flaws of the seven deadly sins.  But will someone please explain to me why you get some odd monologue from a random boss placed on a stage, or why they're not explained after you defeat them?  With less than five or so pages of dialogue after each boss fight, you're not getting a particularly add up to an interesting story.  After you've progressed through a number of stages in the tower, you get less and less interested in the dialogue as you notice that you're playing a simplistic hack and slash with a clunky battle scheme.    Pick out the two robots fighting in this image.  Go on -- we'll wait. You also notice that the game doesn't take advantage of any visual strengths.  The character designs often bleed into what appear to be generic bipeds with random assortments of weapons. Many of these armaments you can't discern by looking at your opponent until the character model fires.  This is unfortunate, particularly because the visuals that are shown in the character gallery are quite nice, but they don't translate over at all to the game itself.  This is also true of the level design.  While it isn't as boxy as last year's title, including other hexagonal room layouts don't necessarily make the environments that engaging or appealing. There's still a ton of pixilation, a ton of oversaturated visuals, particularly when you go up and down levels or whenever fire is onscreen, and a lot of generic details that makes the game look like only a minimal amount of effort was put into the sequel. The multiplayer, which was the saving grace of last year's title, is primarily the same as last year, but the biggest issue with the system has to be the lack of customization.  Players run around maps, picking up weapons and equipment without any idea of what the item is until it's been equipped.  While it forces you to rethink how you approach battle, it sucks that you are forced to use every weapon before you can pick up a new one.Considering the drubbing that the first Rengoku received in the press last year, you'd hope that the sequel was particularly stronger in every single way.  Unfortunately, the game manages to duplicate just about every single problem that the first game had, from a weak storyline to an unbalanced combat system to unimpressive level designs.  It's obvious that the development of this title was definitely stuck in purgatory, which is where you'll be if you decide to play this game.", "date": "Sep 13, 2006"}
