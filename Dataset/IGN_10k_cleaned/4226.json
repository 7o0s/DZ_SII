Instead, Tartakovsky turned out a surprisingly deep, introspective show filled with gorgeous imagery, and a pacing and style of storytelling more akin to the films of Akira Kurosawa than standard Saturday morning fare.  As part of their recent 7-game series featuring Cartoon Network characters (including oldies but goodies like ~The Flintstones~ and ~Tom & Jerry~), European wireless game developer Macrospace has released their own take on Jack and crew with the Nokia- and Sharp-compatible title Samurai Jack: Samurai Showdown. The game is available now in Europe and the UK, and will be launching  soon with most carriers in the US.  Features  Fast and furious gameplay A range of Samurai moves, cool weapons and magic attacks 15 levels of Samurai Jack mayhem  Samurai Jack: Samurai Showdown plays a lot like the NES Double Dragon games. Walk, punch, wait, walk, punch, wait, repeat. In it you control the time-displaced warrior as he wanders across various fields and jungle settings, battling warriors of the evil demon Aku before facing up to the big man himself. The plot of the show is that Jack's father, village and (more or less) life were destroyed by the demon, before he cast Jack a few centuries into the future, to a world where Aku rules over everyone. Needless to say, Jack's got a bit of a grudge.  The problem with this game is that it's just not that dramatic. The TV series is almost overwhelming with its abundance of lush backdrops and intricate artistic direction. And while some of that makes it into this game (travel near the top of the screen, and you'll see some pretty nifty trees floating on a separate layer) mostly you'll just find yourself walking an endless brown plain with no distinguishing marks, aside from an occasional rock or urn. Likewise, the enemies also get repetitive very quickly, with little variation other than their outfits. But still, fighting a never-ending onslaught of zombie warriors could have been quite cool, were they not so slow and dim-witted.  Like Double Dragon, you walk Jack up and down, lining him up with enemies before thwacking them with his sword. In addition to this attack, you can also use a power-draining lightning attack of sorts, as well as pick up temporary weapons along the way such as a bow & arrow (which looks simply adorable as it flies through the air). There is a combo-system that doesn't count for much, but it's there. However the AI of your enemies is almost non-existant. Beating most foes usually boils down to running off to one side of the screen, facing them and then just tapping the action button for 30 seconds or so until they're all dead. In most cases, they seem quite eager to line up in front of you and walk into your flailing blade. Disappointing too is the fact that timing your attacks is not really necessary ? as long as you keep mashing that action button, your foes will not get a slice in edgewise.    What they do have up their little demon sleeves are the common 'game foe cheats' such as being able to walk offscreen and attack Jack where he can't see them, and oddly enough if Jack and a warrior overlap and start hacking away at each other, four of five times Jack takes the blow. These little annoyances wouldn't be that bad except that the game moves at a snail's pace, so it's difficult to get away from such situations. You have plenty of time to plan out your strategies as both Jack and his nemeses shuffle like old men from one side of the screen to the other.  Running isn't too useful as Jack flees almost uncontrollably, however Macrospace's decision to assign a 'jump left' and 'jump right' as opposed to a standard jump works very well in the game, and makes maneuvering out of sticky situations a little more possible. A mid-air slash is also appreciated. Every now and then your enemies will play a nice match of tennis with your skull, but again this is easily (and unfortunately) avoided by just waiting to see where your foes spawn from, then running to the other side of the screen to wait for their lemming-like suicides at your blade.  The art is solid, but sparse. The sprites are incredibly small, but they do retain quite a bit of the personality of their TV counterparts. Jack runs, jumps, slashes and even dies exactly as you'd expect him to, with a minimum but effective amount of frames. Enemies are also effective enough, but the problem is that there's just so little going on in this game. You feel as if you're playing on a half-empty chessboard, and aside from some little-seen details at the top of the screen, it's that same endless floor each level (in a variety of colors) occasionally broken up by a river or hill.  The game sports a few bonus levels, reminiscent of the old Street Fighter II mid-level exercises, and fighting Aku in his various forms was pretty refreshing, but the journey to get there wasn't. And teased by a wonderful recreation of the show's theme song at the title screen, the in-game sound (categorized into selectable sound, dialogue and music options) was as sparse and ultimately dull as the ground you spend so much time staring at. High Score and an online scoreboard (can you beat 3 million points? Betcha can't!) round out the title, which to its credit sports a clean interface with solid instructions and an appreciated array of options.Samurai Jack: Samurai Showdown isn't a bad game. There is a wonderful little charm to the characters and even though you might find yourself beating on the same guys for ten minutes at a time, it can be enjoyable. The game just feels a bit too hollow in the end, like it was made for a phone half the resolution and stretched out at the last minute. Considering how accurate the characters look and move, it would have been nice to have seen them from something a bit closer than a birds-eye view. If you're a fan of the series, and you want a title that'll kill five minutes at the bus stop, this will fit your bill. It's just nothing to write home about.", "date": "Nov 19, 2003"}
