Konami released Fisherman's Bait as an arcade unit about a year ago  it featured simplistic gameplay based on, well, fishing. The controls were basic  you wrapped your hand around the lower potion of a fishing rod (the handle and reel) and tried to catch fish. The game offered very genuine force-feedback as you reeled in the big one, so the submersion into the game world was quite believable. But in a nutshell, the gameplay was simple  how many fish can you reel in on a single credit?  As already said above, the PlayStation version is a dead-on port of the arcade unit, minus the force-feedback controller (and obnoxious load-times at the most irritating moments). But unfortunately, the game was made to be a one- or two-shot deal. There's absolutely no reason to own this game, since the game design wasn't made for it. Graphics  Right off the bat, here's where you can knock a few points off the game's score. The graphics can be segmented into two parts. One is the standard game screen where you're looking over the shoulder of your on-screen persona at the lake. Other than a tiny window that shows the close-up of your lure, this screen is a grainy, 2D, barely animating bitmap. Even the low-budget fishing titles on the PC have better graphics than this. On the flipside, when you actually snag a fish, the game will cut back and forth between the main screen, and underwater where you're treated to a close-up of the fish you're bringing in. This is the only 3D in the game, and it's used well...but it's really not needed. Sound  Other than the occasional ~Fish On!~ and simple commentary from some off-screen guy, there really isn't much audio to speak of. The guy tells you how big or small your caught fish is, and when you've got a bite...but to review this game based on the audio is silly. Gameplay  Okay, it's fishing. But instead of simulating the sport, they've abridged it by simplifying every nuance of the sport. There are only six fish to find (Largemouth Bass, Blue Gill, Rainbow Trout, Snakehead, and two types of Catfish), and seven different lures to use to catch them. You can't pick any spot on the lake  there are only a handful of designated places to set up your camp (if that's the right term to use).  Here's the gameplay: cast your reel, and drag it in. Hopefully you'll get a nibble  if it happens, push down to hook the fish. If you're successful, you'll be in a fight to reel it in  it turns into a game of Track and Field, repeatedly hitting the X and O buttons. If the line tightens up too much, it'll snap, so you'll have to hit the shoulder buttons to let the slack out.  You're rated on the size of the fish, especially in Tournament Mode. But the whole idea is to reel in as many fish as possible in the given time. The bigger the fish you reel in, the more time that's added to the countdown. When time's up, you have to use a continue. Once all continues are up, the game is over.  The first few times you've caught a fish, it's not too bad of a game  that is, until you realize that's all the game is. Forget it. Your PlayStation gaming time is better spent on more elaborate discs. I do have to say, I wouldn't touch a fishing game normally  but since it's a PlayStation game, and I'm a PlayStation game reviewer, it's my duty to give the game a go. This is a renter, folks, and even then I wouldn't race down to your local Blockbuster to give it a shot. I've played 15 dollar PC budget fishing titles with more character. As an arcade game, sure, I'd spend fifty cents to see if I can land a huge bass or catfish. But to have this game in your permanent PlayStation library? Well, that's just plain stupid.", "date": "Feb 19, 1999"}
