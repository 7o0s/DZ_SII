Almost as fun as playing the game being reviewed. Because contrary to popular belief about critics, praising something is infinitely more satisfying than trashing it in a scathing diatribe that leaves the reader wondering ~Well, Mr. Reviewer, let's see you do better.~ Because in the case of Jewel Quest, I-play's mobile port of iWin's ultra-popular web/download puzzler, we doubt we could do better. This is a wildly addictive puzzler that can be enjoyed by anybody. Anybody. And if that's not the cornerstone of good, smart mobile gaming, then what is?   Jewel Quest is a deceptively simple game to get into. You must create threesomes of like-shaped jewels from a grid of sparkling chaos. But the goal is not necessarily to clear the screen -- in fact, you can't. The treasure keeps cascading into the grid. Your goal is to turn the sand behind the jewels into gold by creating those threesome combos. And it's not necessarily easy to do, because if you start just going for easy combos, you'll find lone un-gold spaces that are difficult to fill in without having to create a series of combos to work your way down to said spaces.   Oh, and there's a timer always running. Did we mention that?   Jewel Quest is composed of 100 levels, plus some additional bonus ~quests,~ should you prove yourself a real treasure hunter. The mobile game uses 25 grids four times each, but with each pass, it introduces a new game play mechanic. For example, some jewels will be buried and when you create a combo using a buried jewel, it simply allows the next jewel to fall into that space without turning it into gold just yet. Your next combo will gild the space. Cursed jewels fall into the screen in later rounds that, if made into a combo (but not through a chain reaction), will un-gold the spaces behind them. There are also later puzzles where the first combo turns the sand into silver first, then finally gold when you make the second combo in the space.   To say Jewel Quest is a challenge in later levels is an understatement, however, at no point is it overwhelming to the point you want to turn it off. It's almost a tease, a taunt of a game because when you blow a puzzle, you instinctively know you could've done better, and immediately reach for the 'restart~ key. That's the kind of magic that makes Tetris and Bejeweled huge sellers while other mobile puzzlers like Pop and Drop and Stack 'Um are eventually forgotten.   I-play's mobile take of Jewel Quest is a clean-screen puzzler full of bright colors and easy to identify jewels. Between completed puzzles a gold idol slowly comes to life. Just good presentation perfect for a puzzler -- pleasant, but not distracting.  As mentioned, I love writing reviews for excellent games -- and that's exactly what Jewel Quest is. This is the kind of game that deserves downloading, heavy play, and great word of mouth. It's something that anybody -- casual gamer or hardcore numbthumber -- can really sink his or her mind into. The learning curve is pitch-perfect, giving you enough victories to hook you before really turning the screw. This is one of my favorite puzzlers for mobile as well as an early candidate for one of the best of 2005. After releasing some questionable games like Rollerball, I-play has really found its groove. And it's a pleasure to follow them there.", "date": "Jun 2, 2005"}
