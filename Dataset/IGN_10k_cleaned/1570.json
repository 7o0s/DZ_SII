{"name": "Tomb Raider Chronicles", "name_review": "Tomb Raider Chronicles", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/12/01/tomb-raider-chronicles-3", "text": "Like several gamers I know, I grew tired of Tomb Raider after the first two games, mainly for three reasons: (1) the lack of anything really different, (2) past problems that were never fixed, and (3) because I have a low tolerance when it comes to switch-flipping and block pushing.  My sentiment isn't shared by the die-hard Tomb Raider zealots who can't seem to get enough of the jumping sequences, switch scavenger hunts, and light combat mechanics.  Well, according to the game, Lara Croft is dead and Tomb Raider Chronicles is the last Tomb Raider title of its kind -- AND supposedly the game has ~gone back to the traditional values~ of the series.  I don't know what that means, but if going back to the old-school style means even more of the same-switch flipping action, flawed action sequences, and problematic camera issues then you can count me out on this one. It's sad, but despite some new play mechanics, including a stealth mode mission (a la Metal Gear Solid), the same old flaws are here and the same gameplay that I'm tired of still lives, even if Lara is dead.  The concept of Tomb Raider Chronicles isn't a bad one: Lara Croft has gone missing after her last outing and all her close friends have accepted her death.  It is during the mourning ceremonies that three of those closest to Lara Croft gather around the table, each one recollecting their favorite adventures of Lara.  Among this circle is Lara's butler, Winston, James Yves from Tomb Raider 4, and Father Patrick Dunstin, new to the Tomb Raider circle.  And obviously, as each man recounts his story, you pick up Lara and play through the adventure.  So, you get four different adventures in one game... or actually, four different areas to play the same type of game.  You can say that the visuals in the game are probably the best looking in the whole series.  Maybe it's just me, but that just isn't good enough when compared to the rest of the Dreamcast lineup.  Considering the fantastic differences between the PlayStation and Dreamcast version of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, where the Dreamcast not only had cleaner textures but a blazing framerate, is it too much to ask for the same thing for the Dreamcast version of TR Chronicles?  Lara's latest adventure on the Dreamcast looks cleaner and the colors aren't as muddled as the PlayStation version; overall the game looks pretty nice and the Lara Croft model is the best-looking one so far.  But when it comes to the framerate, it's the same as the PlayStation version -- despite the added power of Sega's console. If Eidos can improve the framerate for Soul Reaver on the Dreamcast, why not Tomb Raider?  On a side note, there's a new ~dripping effect~ after Lara Croft gets out of the water... and it lasts almost a minute.  And we're not talking about small droplets of water here; it's as if all of Lara's pores decided to shoot streams of water out of her body.  Yes, it looks very, very bad. You'll also see the same texture clipping problems, collision detection, and most of all, camera problems that have plagued this game since the very first outing of Miss Croft.  The camera problems are very frustrating, especially since it often affects gameplay at the worst times.   As with the previous title, the fun you'll have with the gameplay of TR Chronicles depends on how much patience you have and how much time you really want to waste on tedious puzzles. Once again, the game is dominated by tricky jumping sequences, heaps of switch flipping, scavenger hunts for ~key~ items, and mindless gun shooting sequences.  All this stuff would actually be sort of fun if Lara Croft didn't control like a badly aligned bus, if they reduced the switch flipping by half, if the ~key~ items that needed to be used were easier to find, and if there was some skill in the actual gun shooting sequences.  Lara takes turns just like she did in the first game, and while she executes some new skills like monkey-climbing, tight-rope walking, and sniping attacks (with the proper gun), she doesn't demonstrate any new advances to her basic movelist.  Jumping sequences are fine, but too often, you won't have enough time to get enough distance between jumps.  ~Key~ items can be frustrating to find, and there have been numerous points in the game where I've spent way too much time just to find a specific stupid key.    Gun sequences are mindless since aiming is automatically taken care of, all you have to worry about is keeping out of the way of an enemy's attack.  Unfortunately, enemies attack in the worst places where the camera won't go, leading to the most aggravating fault in this game - free hits from enemies.  I HATE it when there is absolutely no way to avoid an enemy's attack.  For example, you're walking to a room to turn on a switch and as you enter the room, a dog will pounce out from nowhere to bite you.  I have tried sneaking slowly into the room, and even trying to use the sniper weapon to take out the dog early.  But of course, the dog doesn't materialize until I actually walk into the center of the room where I have no chance to avoid the dog's attack.  Sure, a dog can't kill you with one hit, and very few enemies can kill you with one hit.  But it's the fact that I have no means to avoid the attack at all; when a game is designed so that you cannot avoid the first attack from an enemy, that just isn't fun in my book.  While I like the new environments and some of the new skills, Tomb Raider Chronicles, at its core, is the same game we've seen for the past few years.  I suppose that die-hard Tomb Raider fans have gotten used to the tedious switch-flipping, scavenger hunting, and platform jumping and will enjoy this game. I, however, would rather spend my time playing a Dreamcast game that not only takes advantage of the power of the Dreamcast, but also isn't a game filled with cliched gameplay and tired puzzle ideas.  Besides, Lara's dead, baby... Lara's dead (as I get on my hog and drive away).  --Anthony ~Still Not an Eidos Hater~ Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 1, 2000"}
