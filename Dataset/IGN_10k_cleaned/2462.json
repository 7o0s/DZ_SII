Though Eidos holds the videogame rights to the Winter Olympics this time around, Ubi Soft's grabbed the opportunity to release Salt Lake 2002 on the Game Boy Advance. Unfortunately, it definitely seems like the development cycle on this game was a bit on the short side, because this design lacks a bunch of necessary elements that's necessary in a game of competition. Features Six events Four gameplay modes Battery Save (four save slots) Only for Game Boy Advance Salt Lake 2002 is a compilation of six different winter events, all based on official events in the Winter Olympics. Players can choose to play a single event, a group of events in a single shot, or challenge the record in a time trial or arcade mode. Bobsleigh, better known to us Yanks as Bobsled is a trip down an icy channel in a two-man railed vehicle. This GBA rendition of the sport in Salt Lake 2002 is pretty lame because the challenge is to simply overlap a dot on top of bigger blip in a guide ~radar~ on the upper portion of the screen...the dot representing your sled, and the blip representing the optimal position of the sled on the track.  So, despite the artists and programmers creating a semi-cool 3D engine for the bobsled, the players are just going to stare at the top of the screen. Downhill Slalom, Downhill Skiing, and Snowboarding all utilize the same game engine and game design, so we'll lump all three into this paragraph. The problems with these events are many and annoying...the largest culprit being the actual viewpoint. You're forced to view the action of your skier traveling down the screen, but the camera is so close to the action that you honestly can't see gates or obstacles approaching. Which is an odd thing, since this engine subtly zooms out a bit as your skier gains speed, and zooms in when he hits the brakes. So, why doesn't the camera zoom out even further to show where the slope's going? Visibility is extremely important in skiing and snowboarding, but the game designers assume that it would be fun to limit the viewpoint to a dozen feet ahead of the racer. Guess what? It's not.  The Ski Jump looks great, but it's one of the most basic events in the game. It's all a matter of timing your approach when the wind's at its least violent, and moving a dot inside a target circle during the jump...just keep the dot inside the circle and you'll reach the necessary distance to move on. After two or three jumps, you'll be breaking the record and moving on. It's just not challenging enough a design to keep your interest.  And Curling...a baffling Winter Sport if there ever was one. It's not a complicated event, it's just not one of the most interesting spectator sports in the Olympics. But, in the case of Salt Lake 2002, it's deceptively fun and the best one of the six in this GBA compilation. Curling is essentially shuffleboard on ice, using your sweepers to help along your super heavy curling rock down the alley. Players take turns sliding their four rocks to the scoring area...the closest player to the center takes the points. The design issues are minor but obvious: one, you can't see any stone that didn't quite make the target area. A side-view isn't the best angle for this sport. And two, collision detection is a bit weird...the stones seem to have an invisible border around them, causing them to knock into each other even when, graphically, they never touched. The event just goes on for much too long, especially in the actual competitions. Battery save in the middle of the event would have been extremely helpful.  The biggest fault of Salt Lake 2002 is its presentation. Or rather, lack of one. It's obvious the development team rushed this game to market to make the proper release schedule...after all, why release an Olympics-licensed product after the Olympics' closing ceremonies? The GBA game lacks a whole lot of necessary items to make it feel like you're actually competing. In Ski Jump, for example, how did a 103 meter landing earn your player 158.42 points? It just happens, without visibly tallying all the points. There's also no way to see the current record for each of the six events, unless you participate in the ~Time Trial mode,~ and even then you're only given the record after you've completed the challenge. Nor can you actually view the records that you've actually made yourself...even though the game saves the progress of four different players. When playing against multiple human opponents, you cannot assign your saved character profile to the competition, nor can you even name your onscreen persona during these events. And when you're playing by yourself, you don't have the feeling that you're actually being challenged by anyone else in the events...you're just trying to beat an established ~Target Score.~   I've always been a big fan of multi-event Olympic style games, but these six events just aren't designed well enough to make the cut. The three skiing/snowboarding events are poorly thought out, and the bobsled event is counterproductive. The only event worth playing many times over is, strangely enough, Curling. But the package, as a whole, is pretty cold in its Olympic presentation.", "date": "Feb 6, 2002"}
