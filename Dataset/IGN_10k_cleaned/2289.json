{"name": "AquaNox", "name_review": "AquaNox", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/11/20/aquanox", "text": "Few know Aquanox is actually a sequel to 1997's lesser known, unceremoniously dubbed ~WingCommander clone~ submersible actioner by the name of Archimidean Dynasty. Never heard of it? It was more commonly known as ~Schleichfahrt~ in its homeland of Deutschland (now you know why it was lesser known). That game's story, as well as its child for which you are here to read about, follow the lives of humankind as they exist beneath the dead matter encased seas of a post apocalyptic, surface ravaged Earth.   Taking on the roll of mercenary extraordinaire Emerald Flint, Archimidean Dynasty thrust players headlong into a struggle to save the planet from a mysterious aggressor known only as the Bionts. A race of mysterious robots with rudimentary neural brains controlled by a hive like structure, the Bionts are kind of like toasters, only smart, submersible, heavily armed, and mean -- so then, more like them fangled new microwaves.  Aquanox takes this story, and like all good sequels, expands upon it. The Bionts are all but gone, and once again you find yourself in the sopping wet boots of Emerald Flint watching as a new, more ominous threat awakes due to seismic disturbances caused by an orbiting satellite -- not exactly your first choice for a good morning.  The story is rich and ends up partitioned into manageable chunks delivered in the interim between missions. Choices concerning with whom you wish to converse are made available, but end up under utilized (the whole thing might as well be delivered from end-to-end, person-to-person). Some dialogs drag onto the long and annoying side, but most come reasonably sized and well acted -- except for Flint himself who often comes off as bored and dry. If anything, skipping through them is a breeze if they become tiresome. Further developments and twists come mid-mission, as is often the formula for which a great many games of these sorts follow.  Cramming a 70-page manual full of fiction, descriptions and terminology is also rightfully commendable, but sadly only so because what the developers at Massive have done is something others should take as a standard, but do not. There could have been more added (massive compilations of related MechWarrior booklets come to mind), but the game, despite starting rather abruptly and vaguely, stands on a merit worthy foundation of admirably delivered fiction.  This manner of production value doesn't so much carry over to the QA department (quality assurance for the lexicon deprived).  Aquanox crashes more times than a drunken hillbilly after a football game and three trips through a drive-thru liquor store whilst being attacked by a swarm of ravenous mosquitoes that inject some sort of crazy mutant ~crash~ virus when they bite.  The title's claims of being truly next-gen apparently don't cover the compatibility department. Don't even try playing Aquanox on Windows XP, as literally every single time I loaded it up, I was crashed back out into Windows at some seemingly random interval. I really like the image I've chosen for my desktop, but I don't like it that much. I do understand the game was not specifically designed to support XP, and my gripe with its apparent incompatibility will not affect final score (because XP is never listed as supported) but this kind of lack of foresight is baffling considering the title's focus on other areas of the latest whiz bang technologies. And no, I'm not a newbie; I've tried the compatibility modes, have all the latest drivers, and was even running a GeForce3 and Pentium 4 -- two products that Aquanox has no problem boasting as supported and even enhanced for on its box. I'm sorry if I take so much offence to this, but I kind of like to do a little something with my games called playing, and XP is the way to play now and in the future. Win98 augmented with today's accepted standard in configurations and latest drivers (GeForce line, SB Live, PIII), on the other hand, comes sparsely populated with infrequent crash bugs, not nearly to the point of brain swelling maddening that XP carries with it, but still troublesome.  I honestly can't begin to grasp how this happened because, other than the aforementioned straight to Windows crashes, there was ne'er an occurrence of noticeable bug-infested coding -- the game was rock solid. Perhaps fault lies on myself or my three completely different systems, or even some easily remedied fluke in printing, but the most likely culprit is an unfortunate rush to the presses. Though I even find that hard to believe seeing as how Aquanox has seen European release for a bit now. Whatever the mysterious answer may be, stable the game is not, especially on Microsoft's latest.  If you either don't experience or can easily overcome Aquanox's inherent and incessant failure to function, you'll find two things most prominent about the game...  1) Massive has set a new bar of measurable aesthetic luster in the PC market. 2) This heightened standard does not apply to the way by which the game is controlled.  Perhaps the hundreds of screens, dozens of movies, and several technology demos gave it away, but the secret is out... Aquanox is beautiful to behold. Provided you have the system to take advantage of what it offers (and even if you don't it's still a hefty treat), Aquanox can force your monitor to output visuals you thought only previously attainable in technology demos. Even the mighty Xbox with all the splendor its heavyweights such as the shooter Halo, racer Project Gotham, and fighter DoA3 have to muster will be hard pressed to match the vibrancy, design, saturation, depth, and technical quality the game so effortlessly manages.  Firstly, turn off the V-sync option in the graphics sub menu as it quickly turns a playable clip into a slideshow. With that out of the way...   Texturing is astounding both up close and from a distance. The entire world feels alive with moving particles, drifting seaweed, and gorgeous patterns of light and dark that dance off every surface. The draw distance takes a noticeable hit from all the candy strewn about, but can be easily written off and attributed to the underwater setting. Anyway, I guarantee you won't care at all about how far you may or may not be able to see upon first partaking in an immense battle with what feels like over twenty opponents and a dozen comrades on and around beautifully realized structures and capital ships. The sheer amount of action, is pleasantly overwhelming and insanely implemented when the always striking ship detail is taken into consideration.  The color, design, art, and technology usage both beg and deserve to be seen and appreciated.  Explosions (of which I am a connoisseur and stickler of) are cool, but not quite up to Comanche 4 standards (differences in style aside) and even seem a bit less detailed than Starlancer's, but are still on par with those and indeed also even with those found in Freespace before it (at least in the same ballpark with). That's to say, no craplicious orange blobs from the original Rogue Squadron here.  Suffice to say if you're in it for the pretty graphics and wish only to showcase the power of your system there is currently no better choice than Aquanox. It's deeply saddening then that the same cannot be said about either control or the aural arrangement.   For a game that takes place in the deep blue, Aquanox sure has some funny sounds. Foremost, I hate the assortment of German techno played throughout. It's completely inappropriate, unfitting, and ends up coming off as something thrown in because it was created by the little brother of one of the developers. The game screams for a militaristic, inspired orchestral score, but does not recieve one. Sound engineers charged with developing the audio portions of games should be required to play the likes of Warhawk, Halo, and Starlancer.   In summation, put it this way, if you closed your eyes and managed to drown out the superfluous and oft aggravating German techno you wouldn't for a second know that the game took place underwater. It features none of the ambience, deep bass, and whooshing water associated with the setting. Some sounds seem marginally catered to the environment, but never so much so to strike an awe of believability that wrenches at your gut gnawing for more. All I'm saying is that when you go to a restaurant and order chicken you expect to be served chicken and not steak, regardless of how good said heifer may be.   The combat system fairs no better and plays out like a twitchy first person shooter with poorer mobility grounded in pseudo physics. Everything can spin on an axis at speeds ranging from relatively fast to ~oh crap everything's going blurry.~ Conversely, movement ranges from overweight, retarded, gimpy pig to tired dog -- markedly slow to say the least. There are boosts that immediately propel you to uncontrollable speeds for brief stints, and they come into play as one of the single most distinguishing flight dynamics, but because of the unbalanced speed and turning ability coupled with the more FPS centric controls, combat more often then not degrades into close quarter swing fests with your craft and point of view wildly jerking about.   Because your craft moves forward at a much brisker pace than it does back or horizontally, making passing strafing runs at people will become key. But again, because they can for the most part turn on a dime, they'll just swing around, at which point the winner of the ensuing combat will be the one who can shoot the most with the most powerful. Any sense of actually dog fighting with anything gets depleted to absolutely nothing. A lesson learned from the Starlancer school of intense as all hell dog fighting would have benefited the game greatly. But, as it stands, Aquanox is more akin to an unwelcome amalgamation of a scaled down G-Police and a run of the mill twitch shooter. Here's what that means. You can slowly strafe in all directions, must shoot like crazy, and can't do complete loops (predefined turn limit on vertical directions).  Battles within cities and around obstacles alleviate the tiresome mechanics some, but still won't completely eliminate the problem. Thankfully, tossing aside the mouse and keyboard combo and playing with a joystick helps considerably, but still winds up lacking.   I can't stress this enough, the game would have been un-freaking-believably cool if only it'd came with a developed flight model reminiscent to quick space combat games. Smoothness of control and actually being able to use piloting skill in combat = good. Sloppily jutting left and right just to stare your opponent in the face at all times = suck.  I leave the game angry. Angry at the raw amount of botched potential the game's visuals, story and design worked so hard to develop. Angry that one single game could crash more in a weekend than any other game in all of history. Angry that we still seem to be stuck in the rut of graphics over game. Angry that because Aquanox is only average to good at best, a deserving third installment may not be created.   If, by chance, you fancy yourself a strictly reflex gamer at ease with overly fast control and constant shooting, and also have the high-end equipment to boot, you'll no doubt overcome the slow movement and troublesome swinging to and fro of the mouse at all times to find Aquanox to be a visual delight that's accentuated by substandard audio and a rich fiction.  Please make a third in the series, and please make it proper.  -- Ivan Sulic      Want to share your opinions with the world?
