I know this, because I have met them, worked with them, read an assortment of their thoughts on the subject, and in fact I sit in the cubicle next to one of them right now.  There was and is a point beyond which I did not quite understand them, though.  I found its control scheme aggravating and its visual design aesthetically questionable, although when it got going it presented some pretty impressive sights and smartly-handled dialogue in comparison to its imported competition.  Fear Effect 2, however, presents essentially more of the same, and occasionally more of what I wanted less of in the original game.  While there is more pretty FMV and more nifty HK/Blade Runner/anime-inspired action, there is also more blood, more cleavage, more cheap death, more goofy puzzles, and more Resident Evil-inspired control.  Fans of the original will dig this, and fans of blood and cleavage (yeah, I'm looking at you, Dave Z) are advised to pick the game up without delay, but Fear Effect's gameplay is going to turn off those who've come to expect something more from an adventure game, and I'm inclined to say its content will offend more than just canting zealots.  Gameplay  Now let us consider a piece of junk, if I may borrow a line from an old piece of film criticism.  The junk in this case is not The Night Porter, though, it's the Resident Evil control scheme, which is now surviving into a second hardware generation, as well as a second Fear Effect, and not showing signs of sucking any less.  I wonder whether Shinji Mikami, or whoever it is that came up with the idea, knew exactly what he was unleashing when he conceived of this scheme several years ago.  Probably he thought it was just a stopgap, something to make do with until designers got a better handle on how to deal with a 3D environment.  If only.  That's what Fear Effect 2 defaults to, although if you dig very deep in the options menu you can switch from ~Classic~ to ~3D~ controls, which swaps you over to something approximating Metal Gear-style control.  This improves the situation a little, but you can tell it's an adaptation of the default controls rather than something entirely new -- the characters still turn in slow arcs and pivot on an invisible rod lodged through their spine.  This makes for the usual spots of clumsiness.  The automatic turn-around and auto-aim work reasonably well, but you'll still die plenty of times thanks to the vagaries of the control scheme, auto-aim, camera, and enemy placement (my favorite part is in the hedge maze on disc 2, where you can be killed by invisible enemies located around turns) until you realize that repeated diving rolls can spirit you past a great many threats with ease.  Perhaps this is intentional, something like the Heart of Darkness/Out of this World puzzle-solving-through-repeated-death concept.  Thankfully, the save points are a little more frequent in the sequel.  Fear Effect at least deserves some backhanded props for following the Lame-Ass Brain Teaser school of budget puzzle design, as opposed to the Resident Evil Lame-Ass Fetch Quest school.  I don't know if you've noticed yet, after four iterations, but you do a lot of hiking around finding dumb key-like things in those suckers, don'tcha?  In Fear Effect, you do have to hoof it a little, picking up keycards and things like that, but most of your puzzle-solving dead time is spent scratching your head and wondering why they've come up with so many peculiar variants on the combination lock way out there in the future.  There's color-matching, alphanumeric codes, bar-graph variations on the one about the two bottles of water from Die Hard 3, digital-readout jigsaw puzzles, adding, subtracting, and that's just on the first disc.  They are none of them very hard, which suggests to me that whoever commissioned these security systems should consider switching contractors, and while tedious, they aren't as bad as the sorts of puzzles that make you go from one end of the game to another repeatedly.  I wonder sometimes why design like this bothers me, in Fear Effect 2 and other games, because I grew up on some of the most obnoxious adventure-game design in the world, stuff by Sierra and Icom and Infocom, and poured hours of my misspent youth into matching wits with it.  But back then, those sorts of puzzles weren't 15 years old, and game design had not yet evolved beyond that point, whereas by now it most definitely has.  The classic text adventures also did not have quite such a bollixed control interface -- hell, if you wanted to go all the way to the other end of the area, you could just scratch your head for a second, tap eight or so directional commands into the parser, and ka-ching, you were there, unless you forgot to refill your thermos of protein goo and died of starvation on the way.  It also helped that those games had a very deft sense of humor, which Fear Effect rather lacks -- more on that later.  Graphics  Fear Effect 2 employs the same graphical scheme as its predecessor, using realtime 3D characters in looping FMV backgrounds.  They range from the intentionally drab to the remarkably beautiful, but the main problem with those backgrounds hasn't been fixed -- while they look sharper and more detailed than before (albeit rather dark and blurry at times), they still don't sync up quite right.  The sequences are about three seconds long, and then there's a little blip where the world freezes and resets itself.  That would not be so bad if the beginning and end of the cycle fit together properly, but they don't, making that blip even more disconcerting.  The character animation, meanwhile...The texturing and highlighting of the folks in Fear Effect 2 is in fact very good, giving them a slick cel-painted look.  They're not perfect, but I recognize the technical limitations that require the same side of Hana's thighs to be illuminated no matter which direction the light is coming from.  The animation is what bothers me.  Humans do not swivel their hips that much when there's nobody looking, or indeed when somebody is looking.  I know this from long experience -- and yes, I also know that, to a significant degree, I'm just refusing to take part in the joke.  Kronos does, however, get credit for coming up with a style of character design that allows for a smooth transition between realtime and pre-rendered sequences (as opposed to something like Final Fantasy).  In general, the Fear Effect visual style remains in effect, and the fans it hooked in the first game will continue to enjoy the slick, colorful, angular look of the characters.  Bits of the style still seem a little strange, like the jerky animation of the seemingly pasted-on facial features, but for the most part it manages to recall the appealing qualities of the animation that inspires it while still adding enough of its own original touches.  Presentation  In a larger stylistic sense, Fear Effect is still a cut above most adventures as far as the trappings of cinematic presentation.  Its creators are pretty gifted as far as camera direction and scene-setting go, even if they can't resist the lure of the pointless Matrix homage, and their pacing is hampered by the need to mix interaction into their interactive movie.  The voice acting is pretty well-done, though, even if the actors are occasionally hard-pressed to overcome the cheese factor of their lines.  I was unmoved by the rest of the soundtrack, however, because there often isn't much of one, and the presence of the Macarena, which seems to have made a comeback in the late 21st century, is such an unforgivable sin that it could easily outweigh any number of aural achievements.  There aren't many tracks that stick out otherwise, whether positively or negatively, and most of the time you won't notice many sounds besides the shouts of guards and the rattle of automatic weapons, or the groan that means you've died and had to restart yet another time.  Content  Now we move on to the hard part, because I'm generally in favor of the introduction of more mature themes into games.  While hopping around and stomping on mushrooms in a happy magical fantasy land is all well and good, a change of pace from that sort of thing is nice, and I'm glad that games like Metal Gear Solid have made steps toward presenting adult-oriented themes and content.  But there's a difference between ~adult~ and just ~not for children.~  Now, I am no angel (and Mom, you probably want to skip down to the next sub-heading).  I am, have been, and will be, a conoisseur of the dirty, nasty, offensive, and perhaps tasteless.  Sitting right next to me on my desk here, I have Takuya Fujima Macross 7 doujinshi that would be most accurately categorized as Epic Filth.  Back home on my wall, there's a four-foot-wide print of Giger's Necronom V, the Alien ancestor that's doing something unfathomable with whatever is attached to its solar plexus, next to the Neo Freak 5th Anniversary poster.  I regularly throw in my tape of the Bakuretsu Hunters OVAs and laugh like a nitrous-huffing loon, ditto the original Fist of the North Star flick.  There's a Dwarves/Dayglo Abortions mix album in my CD player running right now.  The point is, most of the time I'm not offended by extreme violence and sexual content, depending on the way in which it is presented.  Fear Effect 2 managed to offend me. Not only will a lot of the content in this game bother the sensitive, straitlaced, or uptight, it will probably also bother more or less anybody with taste.  It is such a geek show sometimes, a bunch of ugly images hung out on the washing line to turn the stomach of anybody who happens to pass by.  We have hideous transmutations, throttlings, blood-spewings, really big needles, draining corpses mixed with the Eszterhasian sex-is-death phobia, gratuitous rat massacres, gratuitous massacrings by rats, heads pierced with giant spikes, mechanical insect cunnilingus, some of the worst pick-up lines ever devised by man, and crimes against fashion deserving of the bastinado, none of which is presented with any evident intent other than as if to say ~Wow, we can get away with some wacko s-word in games these days!~  We are not quite in I Spit On Your Grave territory, but this is a very B-grade affair nonetheless, and unless you get a real kick out of that sort of cheese-and-sleaze melange, you're going to do a lot of cringing during this game.  By the way, if anybody wants to argue the relative aesthetic worth of the Dwarves with me, you're welcome to come by the office and do so -- I'll be waiting behind the door to brain you with a cheap Mexican Stratocaster.  Moving onward...  As for the game's lesbian scenes, which considering the hype behind them deserve their own paragraph, the only thing offensive there is the mountain Eidos made from such a molehill.  Or perhaps I should be offended by the fact that most of our readers were dumb enough to bite -- during the long build to Fear Effect 2's release, every time we stuck ~lesbian~ on a news story strapline, it got double the hits of anything roughly equivalent to it in significance.  Oh, well.  Traffic is traffic. If I ever have to write a review with the phrase ~mechanical insect cunnilingus~ in it again, it'll be too soon.  Sorry, just had to get that out of the way right off.Anyway, I look over what I've just written and seen that it consists primarily of complaints.  This is not very fair, because Fear Effect 2 has positive qualities as far as graphics and gameplay are concerned -- it's quite the visual achievement at times, and it does improve on Resident Evil's aggravation factor.  But when you're playing the game, the fun and impressive bits feel so short in comparison to all the time you spend dying, hiking around, and figuring out silly puzzles.  Furthermore, I feel compelled to reiterate that there are things in this game I really wish I hadn't seen.Y'all are probably chomping at the bit to see them now, though, so have at it -- I doubt you'll be disappointed.  I hope, however, that when Kronos sets to a next-generation project they work on improving their grasp of game design, rather than just coming up with a new set of pretty/dirty pictures to show us.", "date": "Feb 22, 2001"}
