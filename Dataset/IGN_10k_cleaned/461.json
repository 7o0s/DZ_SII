The original concept of Jeff Gordon XS Racing was a futuristic racing game featuring stockcar-like vehicles that go at incredible speeds. On the PlayStation and PC, it makes sense -- you can really give the game the whole ~crazy flips, spins, corkscrews, jumps~ workout with the systems' 3D capabilities. On the Game Boy, this game just can't strut its intended stuff -- this is nothing more than another 8-bit Top Gear-style racing title, and a somewhat dull one at that.  Features Seven tracks Championship and Time Trial Link Cable support for two players For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  The sense of speed just isn't here. The cars may go 400+ MPH, but it sure as heck doesn't feel like it. There aren't enough obstacles on the track to really give the illusion that you're whipping down the course at near landspeed record pace. The 3D scrolling perspective is a decent effect, but it's been done better in games like Top Gear Pocket on the Game Boy Color -- with more hills. Every once in a while you'll hit a bump that will make your car fly sky high, but that's about the only real excitement that happens in the game.  The game isn't ~extreme~ in any sense of the word -- it's simply a matter of avoiding the edges of the road, and the four other cars on the track. Once you've passed the entire pack, the game becomes a task of blocking the opponents from passing you. That's just about it. The game features a one-on-one link-cable mode, but that doesn't bump up the challenge much -- there's just no real technique involved in this racer. Left, right, swerve to miss the oncoming opponent...then stay ahead of the pack. If more focus was spent on making this an exaggerated racing game like San Francisco Rush, Jeff Gordon XS Racing might have filled the niche. As it is, though...it's just a bland wanna-be 3D racer without any real flair of its own.", "date": "Nov 30, 1999"}
