Not since games like Sprung and Ping Pals have we dual screen gamers had to endure something so exceedingly awful. That is, until Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Nemesis hit the DS. The console version wasn't much of a blueprint to begin with, but the dual-screen rendition is bad. Really bad. No amount of unlockable material can hide the fact that Marvel Nemesis shipped well before it was ready.   Marvel Nemesis for the Nintendo DS builds off the concept of the console design: a half-baked one-on-one fighting game featuring an assortment of classic Marvel superheroes and villains, as well as a few original good guys and bad guys created for the series peppered into the line-up. The idea is a sound one, and in fact, Capcom already had incredible success with its own Marvel fighting design. Granted, Capcom used its knowledge and technology in the 2D fighting arena to get the job done,  but it was done right. Marvel Nemesis, however, an original creation, does not, and the obviously rushed, incompetent dual-screen edition  is far worse than the console version.   Regardless of the game's quality, the version created for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube version clearly had far more time to bake in development than the Nintendo DS version. That unfortunate point is made clear in the very first round -- though fighters have an assortment of punches, kicks and special attacks, all the action reduces to simply hammering down on the action button. The character collision mechanics are implemented so poorly that attacks connect a good body's distance apart. And even with the large assortment of characters to control in the game, when all Marvel Nemesis boils down to is an absolutely repetitive and unnecessary ~punch-punch-punch-punch,~ there's really no point in the variety other than the cool factor of having so many recognizable folk at the ready. Actually, that part's insulting as well, since the developer locked away most of the characters. At the start you can only play as four key fighters, with the rest teasing you with a locked icon. Which means the designers force players to endure some of the worst fighting mechanics imaginable in order to free up their favorite characters.    Do not expect the same elaborate presentation in the storyline, because the DS version doesn't have it. Instead, some very uncreative comic panels drive the fights from one location to the other. The DS game features several original battle arenas made specifically for the DS version, many of which are constructed of multi-tiered platforms. But the AI is so bad in this portable game that the computer controlled opponent many times becomes clueless on what to do if and when you end up somewhere that's not on the same level as he is. If there's an obstacle in the way, the opponent will have a hard time moving around to keep the fight going. And the camera system is terrible -- it follows your character and not the overall action, so when the opponent gets off-camera, players have to waste time off the clock just to find out where he went to.   The only truly good thing that can be said about Marvel Nemesis is that it's pretty obvious that the game's graphic engine was given most of the development focus. The framerate is solid and smooth, and the action flows without stutteringat least on a technical level. But the animation is stiff and stilted, and the game's camera system is the absolute pits. The fighters walk and run around at a pace that doesn't match the floor they're marching on. And worse yet, the engine doesn't give the fighters any shadow, which ruins the 3D gameplay further since it's tough to see where the characters stand in relation to each other in the arena.  There's no ifs about it: Marvel Nemesis is easily one of the worst Nintendo DS games released yet. It's extraordinarily hard to see any good in all this bad, and honestly I can't imagine any DS owner working their way through the progression because they're enjoying the clumsy, clunky, chunky, buggy, and most likely unfinished gameplay. If you like this game then you clearly enjoy being tortured.", "date": "Oct 20, 2005"}
