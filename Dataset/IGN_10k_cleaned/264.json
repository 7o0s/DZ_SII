Ignore for the moment the rather high profile personality (that would be Ricky) attached to the game. Normally when a ~big name~ or license is attached to a game and we eliminate that expensive aspect, you're left with a lousy, expensive dud in your hands. But with Championship Motocross, you hit paydirt...so to speak. Here, you're left with a highly detailed motocross racer that offers total bike customization, three bike classes to choose from, an excellent physics model, great graphics and 12 tracks. Sure, it's great that you can race as two time AMA National Motocross Champion Ricky Carmichael, but who cares when this game is so much fun in its own right?  Gameplay The best part about this game is big air on a 500cc motocross bike. If you're not familiar with motocross or motorcycles, a 500cc machine is a beast. We're talking huge and powerful. Only the best can race 500cc machines and Championship Motocross puts these babies between your legs along with the smaller, but still fun, 125 and 250cc bikes.   In Championship Motocross you get both indoor and outdoor tracks to race on, along with weather effects and a variety of track surfaces like mud, grass and dirt. The tracks also have realistic ruts and pot holes that can impact your racing performance.   In real motocross racing, responding to these different racing conditions requires some fine tuning of any stock bike. While real world bike tuning is a science, there is enough in Championship Motocross to get across the dozens of factors that can influence performance without getting too bogged down in details. You can change settings for just about everything on you bike, including brakes, gearing, suspension and tires. There are nine bikes in each class to choose from, each with slightly different performance curves, but you should consider each of these bikes a base from which to develop a customized bike that fits your racing style.  There are 12 different tracks to race on in different areas of the world. Each track also has mirror modes and can be raced in Championship, Single Race, two player or time attack modes. What's great here is that each track requires quite a bit of practice to nail it right, and because of the variety of tracks, players are sure to have lots of great replay value.   As for the computer-controlled competition, the AI, even on the easy settings, is aggressive. There are no easy wins in this game and even if you are used to motorcycle racing from other games like MotoRacer or Road Rash, you're going to have to learn a whole to way to play to master this game. And don't forget, these tracks are indoor and outdoor, as well as dirt tracks.   And for those who want to know about control, it's excellent. Forget about Jeremy McGrath and that sorry old Acclaim game from last year. Forget about any other motocross game. Here, your rider is very responsive and the dual shock lets you know every time you come down for a landing. The bikes are extremely sensitive, making them technically deep to master and long in playability.   Let's face it folks, one of the big spectator draws for motocross racing is death defying stunts and air. There's nothing quite like watching a rider take a hill and go 20 feet up in the air, pull a trick, swing his bike and be heading in a new direction, all in the amount of time it takes you to take a bite of a hot dog. Championship Motocross enables you to attempt those same maneuvers, with an easy to learn, difficult to master, trick system. Players can pull off stunts like no handers, no footers, and the always impressive one footed Superman, among others. Graphics Visually, you'll find that Championship Motocross has a lot going for it. The bikes you can ride are the real thing, and the game's renditions of them are quite good. If you've ever seen the Kawasaki KX250, you'll be able to recognize it in this game.  In racing games, one of the most important graphic elements is frame rate. Poor frame rates equal no fun. Luckily, Championship Motocross is fast, with a great frame rate that also manages to deliver crisp graphics at the same time.  Thankfull, all of the racers are also well animated. This is especially noticeable when you're attempting a trick. Your riders' motions are fluid moving from the seated position to something like the no-handed surfer and back. Crashes, kickstarts, and movement are all very convincing.  Sound So what do you do for a game like this? Techno, jazz, classical, and pop are out, right? Alternative is the current fad, so that's a maybe, but for motocross hard rock is, well, really the only choice. That is, if you have no imagination. Racing games usually delivering some kind of mindless techno or metal, and in this respect, Championship Motocross has fallen in with the crowd. The music is from names you may, but probably won't, recognize, or worse, you'll hate.   The worst offender is ~Too Cold~ from Vanilla Ice. Didn't somebody send him back to his imaginary 'hood years ago? The rest of the songs are really no better and the game would have benefited from just about any other musical treatment. Even generic racing music would have been better than this. C'mon guys.   What the game lacks in musical taste it makes up for in sound effects. The difference in sound between a 125 and 500cc bike is enormous and it comes across perfectly here. The crowd noise is also great, and offers a more compelling audio accompaniment than the music.If you're into racing and big air then THQ has delivered a perfect package. Lots of tricks, great control, good graphics and a high framerate make for a good time. Even though the it will take you a while to master dirt bike racing, the payoff is worth the effort.", "date": "Sep 30, 1999"}
