It doesn't have anything to do with being ashamed  for enjoying a game featuring a cop mouse and some rogue cats. No, it has to do with the fact that I literally wasted nearly an entire day playing the original arcade game in a Disneyworld arcade. Back in 1983 my folks gave myself and my siblings a ~free day~ to run around by ourselves in the Florida themepark, and I was so drawn to this game that I blew through a good amount of paperroute dough instead of enjoying Mr. Toad's Wild Ride or spinning around in the Mad Hatter's Tea Cups. Essentially, my parents fronted an entire day's admission cost just so I could hang out in an arcade and spend my own cash on Mappy. There was something truly engrossing and addictive about that damn mouse. Not Mickey. Mappy.  And that memory comes flooding back after playing a few sessions of the game recently launched in Nintendo's Japanese-exclusive Famicom Mini series. Namco was one of the first third party companies to jump in with their own Famicom/NES games for Nintendo to publish in its first edition of reprints, and what better way to join in on the cheap production value of emulated NES/Famicom games than with an easily recognizable and original game such as Mappy? Mappy is a unique concept, just like many of Namco's classic arcade games of the early 80s. In this one, players control Mappy in a museum set out to recollect booty that's guarded by some pink cats. The museum's lined with trampolines, and the only way to get up to a higher ledge is to bounce up off of them; Mappy's invincible in the air, but the trampolines will break after three consecutive bounces, so it's not a good idea to remain on them for long.  The game follows the Namco formula. Just like in Pac-Man, players can turn the tables on other cats by opening special ~power wave~ doors; the more cats removed in a single shot, the higher the multiplier. And like Galaga, interspersed between two rounds are bonus rounds, and in this case Mappy must pop balloons in a trampoline network without dying or running out of time.  Namco's Mappy can still hold its own with other 80s classics, and the NES version mirrored the arcade version very, very closely...a testament to the capability of Nintendo's home system compared to Namco's arcade hardware. The Famicom Mini version features both one and two player modes, but it's alternative multiplayer so only one system is needed. If two players want to play on individual systems, Mappy, like the other two-player games in the Famicom Mini series, supports link cable and the Wireless Link adapter. Mappy is still incredibly fun and unique to this day, but on the GBA it feels like it should be part of a collection and not as a standalone game. Even though there's a variety of museums and increasing difficulty in the package, the action or tasks never change beyond simply getting harder and faster. That's the way most classic arcade games were, sure...but to ask for the standard $20 price for a single game that's normally included in a retro-package, and in a weaker NES emulated edition, is just a little hard to accept. But, if you want it just for the collectible aspect, it's a great game with its own style of addictiveness...a fun little title that's hard to resist.", "date": "Mar 18, 2004"}
