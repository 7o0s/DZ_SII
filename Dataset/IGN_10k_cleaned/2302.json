{"name": "NFL 2K2", "name_review": "NFL 2K2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/11/21/nfl-2k2-3", "text": "It might be a little late out of the gate, but the first entry from Sega Sports and developer Visual Concepts in the PlayStation 2 gridiron wars is a very respectable one. Sega's ~all sports, all platforms~ declaration is definitely looking like a good move for the company and NFL 2K2 will help the world (maybe just the United States, seeing that nobody else cares much for our football), understand that Sega is sports powerhouse that can stand up to anyone.   With NFL 2K2, Visual Concepts has crafted a great playing football game that's as good as anything else on the market. It gives EA Sports' Madden NFL 2002 a run for its money and the PlayStation 2 version is greatly improved over its Dreamcast cousin released just a few months ago. Is it the best football game ever made? Is it better than Madden? The answers to those questions will ultimately depend on your specific tastes and opinions about how a football videogame should play. However, one thing's for certain -- there's no doubt in my mind that NFL 2K2 is a great football videogame that's a joy to play.  Gameplay The thing that makes NFL 2K2 so enormously fun to play is that it really excels in the gameplay department. If you're one of those people that don't like the fact that the 2K series has always moved really fast and is too responsive in some cases, thus making it a less realistic football simulation, you might as well stop reading right now because that part of the game hasn't changed.   It's still possible to make unrealistic cuts on a dime, the game still moves at a pace faster than it does in real life, and it still has many of those arcade-like qualities. Consequently, if you haven't liked the series because of these qualities, then the many upgrades probably won't make you change your mind about this title.  On the other hand, if you've been a fan of the series on Dreamcast, or have found that Madden is too slow or unresponsive, or just want an accurate simulation of football that feels different than EA's game, then NFL 2K2 has a lot to like. The control is really tight and you'll rarely, if ever, encounter a moment where you feel that the onscreen player didn't do what you were trying to make him do.   The area of the game that you'll notice the excellent control the most is with the running game, which has been improved immensely over past efforts from VC. Not only does the ball carrier respond perfectly to your controls, but the developers have also added a lot of new player animations to deal with some of the problems that have plagued football videogames for years -- ~Mario Running.~   What this term refers to is the common problem where the running back would run into the back of an offensive lineman when trying to fit in a small hole, and instead of slipping past the blocker, he would just get stuck and run in place until the user would move him away or the player would just get tackled. In order to do away with this problem, VC has added new animations that automatically happen when this situation is encountered. So instead of just running in place and coming to a standstill, the running back will either put a hand and push off of the lineman in front of him or turn his shoulders to make him ~skinny~ enough to fit through the hole. Seemingly small things, these new animations help make for a more realistic feeling and looking running game.   The running game is enhanced even further thanks to some new tweaks to how special moves are performed. Spin moves, for instance, are now contact sensitive as there has been a pre-spin animation added where the player slows down to prepare for contact and will spin when hit instead of just in the middle of the field. And since the player slows down a little while doing the move, it's not something that makes the move overly effective because there are some drawbacks to doing it.   And as good as these things are, we haven't even gotten to my favorite part -- the line play. The interaction between the offensive and defensive line in NFL 2K2 is better than you're going to see in any other game currently on the market. Not only do they have realistic blocking animations, but they also move well during blocks and because of this, the art of finding holes is a lot closer to the real-life experience. You're not just looking for a space, but actually reading the blocks of your offensive line to see where a hole might appear that isn't immediately there.   The only real problem is that because of the speed of the game and the fact that player momentum doesn't come into play that much, the art of setting up blocks isn't quite as apparent and realistic. Even still, it's very fun to run the football in NFL 2K2 and the combination of the new animations, great collision, use of the special moves and the improved line play make for a good feeling of realism.  A downside to all of this is that these enhancements make it a little too easy to run the football at times and some of the special moves and the automatic animations are sometimes overly effective. When playing on the Pro difficulty level, which I feel is the most balanced of the three (the others being Rookie and All-Pro), you can expect go easily gain 100 yards per game if you have an upper tier running back.   In fact, in separate seasons my year-end totals with some of the game's premiere runners crushed the Eric Dickerson's single season rushing record of 2,105 yards. I was able to rush for 2,536 yards in a season with Corey Dillon and the Bengals, 2,511 with Rick Williams and the Saints, and 2,601 yards with Edgerrin James and the Colts, with per carry averages of 5.9, 5.6, and 6.9 respectively, and all on the Pro difficulty level.   Even with a less skilled back, like Lamar ~Sub 4.0 Yards Per Carry~ Smith, you can still look forward to putting up some nice numbers if you call an intelligent game. And by this, I mean mix up your play calling effectively because the game's defensive AI does a nice job of making your pay for continuously calling the same play over and over again. You still can get by with running something like the ~22 Iso~ 30 times a game, but you'll just have to make sure you throw in a few pitches here and there and pass every once in a while to keep the defense guessing. And if you're wondering, for my season with Smith, I was able to put up a nice total of 1,592 yards with a 4.5 per carry average (high for him, not too far off from reality).   There is a good side to these bloated numbers, though. The computer can and will often put up big rushing numbers against your defense, which is a rarity these days in football videogames. You'll still likely finish the season with the number one ranked defense in the league against the run whether you're playing as the Colts or the Ravens, but don't be surprised if a good back rushes for 150+ yards on you once in a while, because it will happen.   From a defensive perspective NFL 2K2 does a great job of making you actually worried about defending the run and going up against an Eddie George or Edgerrin James. If you don't call the right kinds of defensive plays and don't worry about stopping the run, backs of this caliber might just shred your defense. Sadly, you'll still have some games where the computer will abandon the run early or will fail to make good use of their pro-bowl caliber halfback, but there's a lot more to say about the CPU play calling which I'll touch upon later in the review.   A lot of the problems with the running game, which is primarily the ease of running with a good back, can be eliminated by upping the game's difficulty to All-Pro, but that actually brings up some issues that I have with both the passing and turnover balance in the game. While it's completely fine that it's difficult to pass in the game and that you really have to learn to mix up your play calling to do well in this area, I don't like the way that it's made difficult both offensively and defensively, which is tied a little too closely to the player ratings.   The difference between a Randy Moss and an Orande Gadsden is just a little more pronounced in NFL 2K2 than it should be. With Moss you can expect to rip apart a defense for upwards of 200 yards per game (in a season with the Vikings on All-Pro, I finished with 2,390 receiving yards), while it's near impossible to put up respectable numbers with someone of Gadsden's rating. You can argue that it's this way because Culpepper, while an overrated chump, is a better quarterback than Fiedler and Moss, while a slacker who doesn't deserve his God-given talents, is much better than Gadsden, the real-life difference between these players aren't quite as wide. Football is a game of inches and the difference between an All-Pro player and an average starter is a little subtler and the game doesn't do a good job of reflecting this.   A player of Moss' ratings will come down with just about every catch thrown his way, while middle-ranged receivers like Gadsden will drop way too many wide open passes, will jump at a wrong time or will take himself out of the play when he shouldn't. The elite player should perform better, but the average NFL wide receiver shouldn't be a complete imbecile, either.   The ratings imbalance can also be seen in defending the pass and how defensive back coverage is handled. The lower the rating of your defensive back the higher number of times you'll see him do something completely idiotic. In situations where there's a receiving going for a catch right in front of him, the defensive back will sometimes jump up for the ball as if it's going right to him instead of doing what he should do -- which is go hit the guy that's clearly catching the guy that's five yards in front of him. Cornerbacks will also go take too many risks and go for interceptions where you wish they would've played it safe and they'll even take themselves out of some plays by stopping and jumping up for a ball in situations where they didn't need to jump and were following the receiver closely on a slant. You can eliminate a lot of this by taking control of the defensive backs, but that shouldn't be a scapegoat for this problem.  What all of this does is create situations where you're prone to giving up big plays and this can be especially devastating -- especially on the All-Pro difficulty setting where you're completely slammed for any mistake you or your computer teammates make. The interception frequency in the game also seems a bit high, as you're punished for any mistake you make. While the challenge is good and you have to respect AI that forces you to call good plays, mix up your run and pass selection and look for an open receiver, it seems that there are too many interceptions in comparison to passes that are knocked down or deflected and way too many INTs that are returned for touchdowns.   Speaking of which, there are an excessive amount of defensive and special teams touchdowns in the game and a lot of it is completely out of your control -- especially when it comes to simple fumbles in the middle of the line that gets returned for 60+ yards by someone like Tony Siragusa twice in the same game.   Even though I have these issues with the way the passing game is handled, I'm still a fan of throwing the old pigskin in NFL 2K2. It's nice to have to work for your completions, Randy Moss notwithstanding, and the defensive AI in 2K2 really makes you earn what you get, even on the Pro setting. If you do nothing but pass the ball non-stop, even with the Rams or the Vikings with Moss, the defense will adapt to your play calling and even double team the receiver you keep going to. Therefore it's in your best interest to mix up your play calling, throw in a couple runs to open up for the pass and vice versa. Just like is the case in the real thing; a one-dimensional attack won't take you that far unless your team over-performs in just about every other facet of the game.   All this is made even more enjoyable by the fact that NFL 2K2 has one of the deepest and most varied playbooks around. Teams have playbooks that are closely modeled to what they run in real life and when you play with these different teams and playbooks you can really feel a difference in the way that you must call the game. And for even more control, the user has the ability to call plays based on the package being sent out instead of simply formation. Likewise, on defense you can call the defensive fronts and coverage separately, giving you even more control of what your defense does. Some of the playbook depth might not be noticeable to casual fans, but for diehards like myself, it's enough to give me a semi-erection, as my deranged high school football coach liked to say.  The game's AI, as mentioned numerous times already, provides of a lot of challenge. Even when putting up record-breaking numbers with the aforementioned backs, most of the games were hard fought and challenging. And even in the season where I went 15-1 with the New Orleans Saints on the Pro level, I managed to get man-handled by a Rams team 36-7 that I had beaten earlier in the year 31-3. There are money plays in the game, but they aren't your typical money plays that work 100% of the time. They're instead plays that will work well, but only if you mix it up with other kinds of plays. You could theoretically get away with running two plays throughout the whole game if one's a pass and the other's a run, but unless you're playing on the rookie difficulty level, you will have to mix it up.   My only real grievance with the AI in the game is that the play calling of the computer can be disgustingly awful at times. It doesn't matter if you're facing a Brett Favre or a Ryan Leaf, the computer offense has no idea how to run a two-minute offense. First and foremost, it'll call way too many run plays when in situations where they should be passing the ball and should be trying to get out of bounds. It's realistic to throw in a draw every once and while to keep the defense guessing, but with less than a minute on the clock and down by five points, the Colts would never hand the ball off to James five consecutive times, consequently running out the clock and letting the game end with three timeouts left in their pocket.  The CPU is horrible at managing the clock in general and won't always use their timeouts effectively when on defense or offense near the end of the game. And you'll even see this in extreme situations where calling a timeout is the only option. In a particular victory, the time ran out on the computer as it was just about to kick the game winning field goal -- and it had two timeouts remaining. Similarly, the computer won't even try to run out the clock and it's entirely possible to have 50 second left to play in the game and no timeouts and stop the computer with enough time left to get off a last-second desperation play.    So, there's the control, running game, passing game, some offense some defense, AI...what's left? Oh, that's right -- the special teams. For those familiar to the 2K series, the kick meter is pretty much unchanged. You have an arrow, which is moving and must be corrected on the fly that controls the height and direction, and a meter that controls the power. I personally don't care for it much, as I'd rather have kicking extra points and kickoffs be a little more ~mind-less~, but it does make for a little more tension when kicking field goals and it's not overly difficult by any means.   Features Even though I've pointed out good number of problems with the gameplay in NFL 2K2, the bottom line is that it's a great playing game of football. As I've said many times already, the challenge is welcome and despite the play calling problems, the AI is fantastic. Where the game falters a bit, especially in comparison to its biggest competition, is in its features set.  It does have all of the big, must-have features, including things like practice, team create, player create, fantasy draft, franchise and so on, but it's somewhat lacking in the presentation of each of these features. In the case of the Franchise mode, even though you have your career stats tracked for each player, you can only look back to season stats for the previous year only and not anything before it. And for some reason, you can't have a look at the current season stats once you enter the playoffs, even though you can look back at them when you're playing the subsequent regular season.  And even though the game does feature a rookie draft during the pre-season, it seems somewhat limited as you can only see the list of players at each position and can only see the player ratings in five categories. A lot of functionality that should be there just isn't. You can't pull up a list of all the players that have been drafted, you can't check up on the draft picks of other teams, you can't make draft day trades, and you don't have a lot of player information available to you that are offered in the drafts in other games.   There are also quite a bit of navigational problems with menus and in trying to find things in the game. If you want to find out when an injured player will be back for your team, instead of going to the Management section where it seems like it should be, you must go to Stats, then to This Season, and then to Injuries. And even there, you're give a full list of all the injured players in the NFL and not just your team.   Setting your depth chart is also more of a headache than it should be. Some of the positions are lumped together into one category, which makes for some trouble in deciding who's the starter for certain positions. Instead of having a depth chart for strong/weak cornerback, free safety and strong safety separately, they're lumped into one list that doesn't really define which order that it's listed in. The top two in the list will be your cornerbacks and the third and fourth will be your safeties, but there's no way of knowing this without just figuring it out by yourself. Within the game, you can substitute players by package, but this is only an in-game option and can't be done in-between games.  Outside of the problems in presentation and functionality, NFL 2K2 does have most of the bare bones features that are now must-haves in football games. The trade logic seems pretty good and it's cool that you can put players on the trading blocks and teams will offer you trades out of the blue and will make counter offers to trades that you make to them. It's not too hard to use trades to make a dynasty of sorts by doing things like picking up free agents that are highly rated, but nearing retirement, and trading them for a young player that's not as highly rated but on the way up, but it's up to you as whether or not you take advantage of this little flaw. However, other than the apparent neglecting of player age in the trade logic, it does seem pretty fair in that you'll have to give up a good player or players to get one of equal talent.   Graphics The visuals in NFL 2K2 are pretty impressive, especially when you consider that Visual Concepts hasn't really had all that much time with the ~difficult to program for~ PlayStation 2. The polygonal models, which are comprised of approximately 2,700 polygons (that's what I'm told, I didn't count) each look fairly realistic and are highly detailed.   The models are realistically sized and there are a lot of different player sizes. It seems that VC has even fixed some of the player model problems that were in the Dreamcast games, which included blocky looking facemasks, helmets that were on the smallish side and the almost complete lack of necks for many of the players.  Details on the jerseys and helmets are also really nice. It'd be nice to see a little more definition with the mesh on some of the jersey's and certain things like the emulation of the way the jerseys look when they're stretched around shoulder pads isn't quite as detailed as you get in Madden, but these are minor complaints and not major issues.  General player animation is also quite good. Because of the speed of the game, it doesn't always look all that realistic, but there's a lot of variety in the animations you'll see and the collision detection between players is quite impressive. When a defensive player tackles the ball carrier, it looks like a real tackle and the player bodies look like they're interacting with each other. There are just a ton of different animations for player contact that just help make the game look a little closer to reality.   Quarterbacks will raise his arm to point out defenders when walking up to the line, the blocking animation you'll see between an offensive and defensive lineman is probably the closest that I've seen to mimicking reality, and there are just a lot of neat little extra animations that don't affect the gameplay directly, but instead simply enhance the experience of the game.  The most impressive aspect of the player models is their face textures. A lot of the players look exactly like they do in real life. Case in point -- when playing the game this weekend, there was this close-up of Warren Sapp celebrating and smiling after a big sack in the game and at the same time, there was a highlight on some half-time show that showed Sapp's big cheesy grin in real life, and it looked strikingly similar. Not all of the player faces are quite this accurate, but even the ones that aren't, still look good.   You obviously won't see it while playing the game and you don't really get much of it during the instant replays, but if you go back and zoom in on a player during a play, you'll actually see that the player's face is fully animated and his emotions will change as the play progresses. It's so detailed that it actually looks like the player is taking in and exhaling breaths.   Similarly, there's an insane amount of detail in the sidelines. In addition to the fully polygonal players and coaches that you'll see on the sidelines, you'll notice camera men, cheerleaders, the chain gang, and random people that are probably there because they're the ones supporting some player's drug habit.   The grass textures are also worth mentioning. Six layers of grass textures have been created, so the grass will look good regardless of how far the camera is from the field. It looks best when close-up, but doesn't become distorted and overly blurry when the camera is moved back because a different texture is being used.   Yet another visual treat worth pointing out is that the game features dynamic lighting and shadows where the shadows are actually cast on the players and not just the field. When players run into the shadows, whether from the stadium, moving clouds or a blimp flying over, they'll actually become darker.   On the other hand, the general lighting could use some work. When playing day games, you don't quite see the differences for when the sun is at different angles, the glare and reflection off of the helmets in night games need to be a bit more pronounced, and it'd be nice to see them recreate the overexposed look of the field that you get when watching afternoon games on the television.  My only other real complaint is that there's some slowdown during the actual gameplay. It's not a big problem and the game generally runs at 60 frames per second, but during some plays, especially on runs up the middle, you'll see some distractive slowdown. It's not bad enough to destroy the game, but it's there nonetheless.   Sound The sound and commentary in sports videogames is one of the areas where there's probably the most room for improvement. We'll obviously keep seeing improvements in the graphics, but the next big leap probably won't happen until we move onto the ~next~ generation of consoles after the PS2, Xbox and GameCube. Gameplay will always see new enhancements from year-to-year, hopefully, and there are still a lot of things that can be done in other facets of these games, as well. However, it's in the area of sound where things probably can be improved upon the most.  NFL 2K2 has actually made some nice strides in this area, primarily in the commentary during instant replays. Instead of just keeping quiet, which is what you'll get in some other games, or just saying some random unrelated crap, the commentary during instant replays is actually tied into what's going on. The commentators will actually comment on specific moves by the ball carrier, such as a spin or good juke, and his comments will happen as the move will happen. It's done really well and helps make the gaming experience feel a little closer to the TV-watching experience.  The general in-game play-by-play and color, which are handled by Dan Stevens and Peter O'Keefe, is only average, though. There is a lot of variety in what they say and there's a nice mix of comedy here and there, but they do get repetitive at times and aren't always completely accurate with what they're saying. For instance, if you run a lot in succession, you might here the same line about missing the correct hole, even if the only reason you didn't run it there was because Warren Sapp busted through that gab and forced you to try and bounce the play.  That said, it's still superior to any other football game on the market and it does feature some cool things that you won't find in many other titles. The commentators will actually refer back to things that happened earlier in the game and if you do something like run the same play over and over and keep getting stuff, they'll call you out. Likewise, if you keep running the same play over and over effectively, they'll comment on how you're doing that and the defense still can't stop you. It's done really well and makes up for the repetitiveness that you'll encounter, as it's still more varied than just about anything else out there.  NFL 2K2 also does well in the area of general sound. The crowd noise is dynamic and will actually change based on what's happening in the game. If the home team's defense is backed up against its own goaline, the crowd will get louder and chant defense. If you choose to go for a field goal instead of going for it, your home crowd might boo a little. It's pretty good, and yet again, helps make the experience a little more lifelike.   On the subject of making it more real, the game actually presents several different sound settings that you can play the game with, including TV Broadcast, In Stands, On Field, Off, and Default. With each option, the different sound sliders, which include Commentator, PA, Referee, Sound Effects, Crowd, Player Chatter, PA Music and Menu Music, are adjusted to make the experience more akin to whether you're watching it on TV, on the field, in the stadium, or just playing a videogame.

The big question on everyone's mind is undoubtedly, ~is NFL 2K2 better than Madden NFL 2002?~ Unfortunately, at least for those of you looking for an answer, I don't have a clear-cut answer to that question. The biggest problem with trying to answer that particular question is that Sega's NFL 2K series and EA's Madden series are based on two different styles of gameplay and whether or not you like one over the other will ultimately depend on the play style that you prefer and not necessarily which is the superior product.And before you begin thinking that it's a case of NFL 2K2 being arcade-styled while Madden 2002 is more of a simulation, that's not really a fair assessment, either. Both games are simulations of the sport of football and while Madden does a better job of simulating certain aspects than 2K2, Sega's game bests Madden in other areas. Both games should be considered simulations of football, with the biggest difference being that 2K2 moves at a much faster, possibly less realistic, pace, whereas Madden is a little slower, more methodical, and takes into account momentum when it controlling the player, making it less responsive to your controller movements. Which style is better? It all depends on what you're looking for in a football game and there's really no clear-cut winner in my opinion. The bottom line, at least in my opinion, is that both titles provide great football experiences and it'd be possible to argue in favor of either game till your face turns blue. As for why NFL 2K2 is getting 0.2 points less than Madden, it's a situation where I think that while both titles are pretty equal in terms of gameplay that Madden is a much more polished product within its world. If you've been a fan of the NFL 2K series on Dreamcast or have grown tired of Madden and want a rock-solid football simulation with more responsive and faster control, you're going to enjoy NFL 2K2 more than Madden 2002 and you'll probably even bitch about my score. But, assuming you believe my theory of equal but different, then you'll have to agree that NFL 2K2 has a lot more room for improvement within its particular world. Its franchise mode isn't nearly as polished or deep as Madden's, or ESPN NFL Prime Time 2002's for that matter, it lacks a lot of functionality outside of the gameplay that Madden offers, and to repeat what was said a paragraph earlier, it's just not as polished of a product. It's still a great football game and a perfect title to pick up if you've already played through several complete franchises of Madden because since it does have a completely different feel to it, you'll be treated to a distinctively different play experience. And for those of you that passed on Madden waiting for Visual Concept's beast, you're going to enjoy the heck out of it, as it's the best that the series has yet to offer (at least for now).", "date": "Nov 21, 2001"}
