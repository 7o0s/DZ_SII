But in the late '80s and early '90s, the landscape of competitive video gaming was much different  especially in Japan. Had you lived in or visited the home country of Hudson in those days, you might have been able to attend one of their All-Japan Caravan Festivals  events that pitted player against player in competition for high scores on the latest and greatest vertically-scrolling shooters. The game of choice in 1990 was Super Star Soldier.   A sequel to Star Soldier from the NES, Super Star Soldier was the first spaceship shooter game Hudson developed for their TurboGrafx hardware. Attendees of the 1990 Caravan Festivals found out quickly that the leap to more powerful hardware meant a dramatic increase in the look, feel and challenge of the series  especially the challenge. This game was, and still is, truly difficult.           Shooter fans who've mastered Radiant Silvergun and Ikaruga may find it to be a walk in the park, but in 1990 few other titles had thrown so many massive swarms of quick-flying enemies at the player. Success comes from keeping calm and making good choices in powering up your craft, particularly in the area of weapons upgrades. Four varieties of blaster are available, including a basic rapid-fire gun, a flamethrower, a lightning shooter and a rippling spreader. Collecting colored orbs activates one of the four, and grabbing more of the same color increases its power.   Your starship suitably armed, you'll feel confident as you lay waste to the waves of baddies. But the difficulty doesn't subside even when you're flying a totally pimped out ride. Stray shots and single bullets are enough to knock your power-ups out, and if you collide with anything while powerless, well, you're dead. Death comes with harsh penalty here, as Super Star Soldier will often throw you back to the very beginning of a stage instead of respawning you where you fell. Progressing through the game, then, takes a nearly perfect run each time.   Dying isn't so dire in the game's other modes, included in the title specifically for Japan's competitive festivals. They're 2 Minute and 5 Minute time attacks called Caravan Mode, and they're races against the clock to see how high a score you can rack up in a limited amount of time. You can die as many times as you want and the timer will still keep ticking, though you probably won't be posting much of a lofty number if you're wasting time with respawns. These modes make what is supposed to be a single player game have effective support for as many players as you want  just keep passing the controller around and see which of your friends is the greatest Soldier in the stars.  Super Star Soldier is the sole shooter so far on the Wii's Virtual Console, and Hudson's decision to include it in their first batch of TurboGrafx games was a wise one. The game holds up well after over a decade and a half, and it's likely to find an all-new audience of fans that missed out on its original release years ago. If you like jumping into the cockpit of games like R-Type or Gradius, hop in and give this lesser-known ship a spin.", "date": "Dec 8, 2006"}
