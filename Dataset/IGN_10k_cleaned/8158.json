You won't notice at first, because its polish and bombast does such a good job of persuading you it's something special. But for all its grand gestures and macho chest-beating, this is a very old-fashioned game, and one that thinks small.Where other titles would have set the opening shoot-out in some sprawling, or at least multi-storey level, here we have a night club that is little more than three or four small rooms linked by corridors. And yet you'll be fooled into thinking something much more sophisticated is going on by the unyielding noise and the kaleidoscope of colour. It's a good summation of Infernal as a whole: a lot of spectacle and trickery with little substance underneath.  The back of the box does a better job of explaining the convoluted plot than the game does. And the story isn't improved by some rather clunky exposition - the kind that holds up its hands apologetically and says ~I know I'm a bit of rubbish, but I promise you'll be shooting monks in the head in no time, really.~And that's exactly what you'll be doing, and probably having fun too, at least for a while. Playing as Ryan Lennox, another in a long line of badly-named, poorly-developed game characters, you take on the guise of a fallen angel, now working for the other side. But Ryan looks like he was condemned to be Beelzebub's monkey from the start. His ~I Love Satan~ goatee and his attempts at tough-guy banter were never going to make for a believable cherub.As you'd expect, the one interesting character, and the only one with a half-decent voice-over, is the Devil himself - a cross between Ice-T and Robert de Niro's demonic turn in Angel Heart. But even the Lord of Darkness has to suffer the ignominy of being a walkie-talkie guide through the missions. When you hear the Devil's voice in your head, it's supposed to say things like ~take the forbidden apple~ and ~mow down your postal co-workers with an AK-47~, not ~powerful shots cost you a lot of mana. Use them only when necessary~.  Those powerful shots are just the first of your ungodly powers. As you progress through the game, you develop second sight, telekinesis and the ability to teleport. None of them really lift the action as you'd hope though, and are used mostly when the game requires you to use them. Infernal is like a flashy sports car with a thundering engine, but one which only ever lets you drive in a straight line, and which doesn't seem to be going anywhere interesting. Considering the closed-in feel of the finished game, it's surprising to learn that there was originally going to be driveable (non-metaphorical) vehicles.While, for the most part, you can gun your way through legions of enemies without much trouble, the game keeps engineering unnatural ways to kill you, frustrate you and make you wear out the Quickload key. A couple of these instances, usually boss battles or death traps, are more likely to have you wishing the whole damn thing to hell rather than thoughtfully studying your next move. This is the lack of balance we were bemoaning in the preview and while we were hoping these issues would be redressed, it was never going to happen without pushing back the release date another six months. Ditto for the enemy AI, which still feels anything but intelligent.    There is also an irritating level of inconsistency in how the environment behaves and how you can interact with it: you can jump over this wooden fence but not that one, even though they look identical; you can climb up this steel grating but not the one right next to it; you can blow up some objects and walls but only the ones the game lets you.It seems cruel to label the action with that tired, old adjective of ~mindless~. After all, you need to use your powers to solve some basic puzzles and have to figure out how to get out of seemingly impossible situations. But somehow it's the mindless part that stays with you: the endless vomiting of ammunition into anything that moves, the explosions, the constant repetition of the soul-sucking animation by which you replenish mana and collect weapons off dead enemies, the succession of samey locations within levels.  Of course, mindlessness is always a bad thing. If you go into it with the right expectations, there's plenty of hours to be lost to Infernal's pretty, if derivative, charms. But there's no getting around the fact that if Infernal were a Simpsons character, it would be Disco Stu, posing around and making a lot of noise while dead goldfish lollop around in his see-through platform shoes. It's about time those witless action game  clichs got flushed down the toilet.For all its flamboyant gameplay tweaks, there is something very primitive in the way Infernal plays out; a lack of sophistication that will sometimes have you looking for a coin-slot. The third-person perspective lacks fluency and gets in the way, and you never feel properly submerged in the supposedly epic struggle between Good and Evil. And still there is enough going on, enough moments of frenetic pleasure, that it will probably find an audience willing to forgive those flaws. The rest of us though, are probably better off resisting temptation.", "date": "Mar 2, 2007"}
