That said, it does add on some new features and more action that fans of the original game will be sure to eat up. The new additions include five new weapons like the M14 and Scorpion, new multiplayer options including the new Turn Table mode, and a brand new campaign which has some great moments and some mind blowingly frustrating moments that follow a different main character across several new missions. Even with some gameplay problems and relative brevity of the campaign, Fist Alpha is still an acceptable expansion to one of the more interesting shooters of last year, especially at the lower $20 price tag.   The new campaign serves as a prelude to the original game. It follows the exploits of the same crew that you play with in the original game but under the command of your character, SFC Warren Douglass, a new addition to Vietcong. The ~story~ of the game shows the recon and beginning process of creating the Nui Pek base your crew is stationed at in the original Vietcong as well. It interesting seeing it being built and seeing it become what we had seen previously.   Fist Alpha will also introduce one other new character named Nguyen Nham, who will serve as your point man for the first portion of the game until your old friend Nhut joins the squad. The rest of the guys, including Hornster, Crocker, DeFort, and Bronson are all back on the squad in their previous capacities with their same personalities, which you'll see more of in the cutscenes than the actual game.    The new campaign is a short affair that is a lot like the original. There are some interesting and varied missions that create a very tense and dangerous atmosphere. There are a lot of shooters out there, but there's nothing quite like the Vietcong experience and those that haven't given it a try might want to now that it's been repackaged along with the expansion. What you'll find are forests thick with undergrowth and full of enemy soldiers laying in wait for you and your band of soldiers. The pace and mood are nearly wonderfully controlled in most cases with some of the most impressive and unnerving moments residing in the calm before the storm. You know the fight is coming, you just don't know exactly when. But when that gunfire finally erupts and you're in the middle of a bullet storm, it can cause some serious heart fluctuations.     Missions will take you in and around Nui Pek as the United States tries to establish its base there. Not only will you be leading reconnaissance missions and defending the fledgling base, but you'll also be heading out to remove hostile forces in the area in assault and stealth based missions. Frankly, assault works much better than stealth here. Over the short campaign which I finished in roughly five to six hours, including time to create profanities vile enough to have my reservations in hell dropped down another level, I probably had about four hours of fun, mainly because of some AI issues and one sadistically sick level.   This particular level is at the very end of the campaign and charges you to sneak into an area to destroy a radio before starting an attack in earnest. The rub is that you can't ever be seen for more than a fraction of a second. If you are, the enemy will somehow telepathically signal his friends that you're there who will in turn set off the alarm which will result in a mission failure. In fact, if you bring your squad at all, they'll immediately break out their noisemakers and shoot the baddies as much as possible, also blowing cover. The worst part about this is that they all begin the level with a damn silenced pistol in their hands. Why don't they just use that pistol? I don't know but you'll have to enter the danger zone all by your lonesome and quickly learn the locations of the enemies, usually by being killed through a clump of bushes or by being seen from some unknown direction. At least once you've been killed the camera will move to the location of your murderer at which point you'll know where to murder him first. This whole level is simply an exercise in frustration where the AI is either too good or awful. Either it will be able to spot you crawling through the underbrush from 50 feet away or they won't be able to hear their buddy get shot in the head two meters away. They won't react to dead bodies and set off the alarm, but are jumpy as hell to a faint rustling of the bushes from your direction... it's bizarre and simply not fun.    Dealing with your own squad members is also an issue. You'll lose a mission quite often simply because one of your men was caught in a grenade explosion somewhere across the map where you have no say in the matter. Losing missions and having nothing to do with losing them is probably one of the most frustrating issues in Vietcong. If the mission is a failure then it better be my failure. In many instances it seems that the dev team had seriously considered this. Your squad mates are nearly invincible when it comes to being shot. You'll see them get peppered with a barrage of bullets that would kill superman yet one stray bullet will cut your life short. But they still died fairly often from a stray grenade.   Aside from that, they'll usually pick targets intelligently and dispatch them in a short amount of time. Your point man is also still good for leading you around traps and alerting you of imminent danger. The only problem here is the sketchy pathfinding that will lead your men to wander in circles, get stuck on trees, or bunch up together for a good couple of minutes before they can sort themselves out.   Along with the small, yet mostly satisfying, campaign are some additions to multiplayer. The five new weapons can be used by everybody, including those without the Fist Alpha expansion, with the new 1.60 patch, which is pretty much being used on every server that I saw. A new multiplayer game type has also been added called Turn Table where teams will have to capture a series of flags. Once the last flag has been captured, the sides will be reversed and the other team will have to attack. Whichever team takes the least amount of time to finish it wins the point. While the idea is good and can be used for more competitive gameplay, most of the servers are running older game types and older maps. Maybe that will change as more people pick up the expansion. In any case, multiplayer remains a good portion of the game and a pretty good experience by itself.   Both the single and multiplayer portions of the game use sound well, although the single player game certainly shows it off a bit more with some of the best ambient sounds in the business. It has the power to draw you into the game that much more before your point man ruins the illusion by getting stuck on a tree.     The visuals are looking a tad worse at this point when comparing it to nearly released games that use similarly dense environments such as Far Cry or Joint Operations. There are points in the game that I was actually fairly impressed while others would simply show off some blurry textures, blocky environments, and sub-par special effects. But at least it runs pretty well this time around. The original had some serious technical problems on release that have been fixed at this point so both the original and the expansion should run smoothly on your machine.  There's really no way of getting around it. Vietcong and the expansion offer a type of gameplay in a shooter that you can't really find in any other setting. The recently released Call of Duty had squad based combat and the brother in arms mentality, but without the more personal nature that familiar faces and personalities bring or the ability to influence the action of other soldiers on the battlefield.But there are still some problems with the AI and some of the level design that can leave a frustrated film on the gaming lobe in your brain. It's so close to being a seriously great experience that it can drive a guy crazy. The ideas are great, the execution is not always.Still, the Vietcong: Purple Haze package with both the original and the expansion is a box that gamers might want to check out if they haven't tried Vietcong out at all yet.Now the Vietcong: Fist Alpha expansion by itself has some great moments but is quite brief and doesn't add quite enough material for me to recommend it for everyone. That being said, if you really enjoyed Vietcong you'll get more of the same, and that isn't so bad for the $20 price.", "date": "Feb 27, 2004"}
