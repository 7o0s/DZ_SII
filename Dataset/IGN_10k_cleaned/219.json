For better or for worse, the Japanese developer of so many Street Fighter games (15 now?) looked like it would never enter the ~modern~ 3D world, trumpeted by Sega's Virtua Fighter 3 and Namco's Tekken series.   But the bitter 2D/3D war ended not too long ago when one of the most innovative fighting games in ages hit Japan, Capcom's own PowerStone. While games such as Virtua Fighter 3 mastered the traditional realistic 3D fighter, and even Midway's Bio Freaks tried to stretch the realm to new heights with multi-tired arenas, weapons, and unique characters, Sega's masterpiece never took off in the US, and Bio Freaks lacked the tension and refinement(among other things)that help define a break-through title.  With PowerStone  , Capcom not only leap-frogged its own crop of 2D fighters into the 3D realm, it has forged a new kind of fighting game, with an acute sense of gameplay, graphic prowess, and interactive creativity that has yet to be matched. It's no Soul Calibur, but it easily stands on its own, and has paved new inroads in the fighting genre.  PowerStone brings gamers into 3D environments with interactive objects as potential weapons, and provides complete 3D character movement, real weapons, and four collectible stones so eager fighting fans can battle it out for the winner's crown. Once all stones are collected, the characters transform into a more powerful adversary, able to cause considerably more damage than while in their regular form. Unlike a normal fighter, characters cannot block, but they can use nearly everything in the arena to attack, strategize, and defend. Adding to the game's complexity is the multiple tiers.  The game takes place on all sorts of platforms, steps, and second and third stories. Where this game succeeds to this end and Bio Freaks failed is in the size of the arenas. The smaller levels of PowerStone do a good job of containing players, preventing them from getting too far from one another, thereby maintaining tension-filled fights.   Not that you'll warm up to this in an instant. At first, PowerStone is just plain weird. It's not like anything you've played before. But after the first couple of minutes, picking up the simple four-button fighting system is easy. In fact, although I'm not a big fan of the wide-load Dreamcast controller for traditional 2D games, it works with PowerStone like a champ. Originally a Naomi-based arcade game, this home convert uses the exact same button configuration as the coin-op, so arcade-goers will instantly pick it up, while newbies need only take a few minutes to champion the moves.   Identifiable, too is the game's cast of characters.  With a decent crop of never-seen-before fighters, PowerStone corrals a wide variety of heavy, middle, and feather weights into play, balancing speedsters (Ayama, WangTang) with strong men (Gunrock, Galuda), and countering the traditional Ken and Ryu-types (Falcon, Ryoma) with mummies (Jack), pirates (Kraken), and genies (Rouge). All told, the game's 8 regular characters and bonus characters for a count of 10 total. While there certainly could be more players, learning each -- and the many environments -- is part of the fun. Each contains an innate set of moves, such as hitting, kicking, swinging, throwing, picking up weapons, grappling, jump-attacks, rolling, climbing, spinning off columns and pillars, and collecting, to name a few.   The difference in character moves varies generously after that. Rouge projects fireballs in her regular state, while big men Galuda and GunRock can savagely dislodge long columns and pillars from the arena to bat you into unconsciousness, and Ryoma and Jack wield a samurai sword and twin knives, respectively. Jack is by far the most unusual of them all, walking like a spider on all fours, able to hover in mid-air, and capable of bizarre super attacks reminiscent of those in Darkstalkers, with power saws and colorful projectiles aplenty. Each of the buttons while in super mode enacts a small world of new moves that intensify and deepen the game. They also add the perfect level of depth and tension to the 3D environment, setting apart PowerStone from any competitors with hit-and-run strategies -- once you've bashed your competitor smartly, a powerstone flings out of him or her, and hopefully nearer to you.            Fast action aside, what makes PowerStone so amazingly fun is the balance. Straight fighting, air attacks, the use of objects as projectiles, and a variety of weapons all combine with the hunt for powerstones to bring a tightly woven package, all showcased in perfectly sized arenas that feature cleverly placed objects and weapons, and are wrapped up masterfully with interactive backgrounds. The pure quantity of attacks is blissful on its own. Double- and triple-taps make up the bulk of standard fighting moves. But this game doesn't rely on standard fighting techniques alone. Weapons always come in handy. And the weapons selection alone is awesome, ranging from a gun, rocket launcher, and a flame-thrower, to a sword, crowbar, stick, and hammer, to timed bombs and roman candles. These appear any time players run by a chest. If you prefer using inanimate objects, your choices are still bountiful. Chairs, tables, urns, sandwich boards, boxes, crates, and barrels, among others, are easily picked up by pressing B. Jump while holding a weapon to intensify combat, and then hurl them. Finally, there are the finesse attacks, created by jump moves, but also implemented by the use of the environments. Characters can swing off poles, columns, and pillars to move into the offensive. They can leap-frog boxes, crates, and barrels to knock opponents down. And they can hang from the ceiling or stick to the walls and jump attack. The amount of interactivity is staggering at first, but this is where PowerStone truly shines.    Actually, that's a partial lie. This game, while more cartoon in style, is a visual stunner, too. An arcade-perfect port from the Naomi-based arcade game, The Dreamcast version loses nothing from the translation. Up until the Dreamcast, this kind of port simply didn't happen. Games always lost something, frame rate, animations per second, textures, effects, etc. Not here, holmies.  Graphically, the animation style varies dramatically from anything Capcom has created previously. Many of the characters are more generic in look, and lean more toward an anime style, close in look to old Speed Racer episodes.    What characterizes them most is the amazingly smooth motion, which each one has in buckets. These characters are without seams, angular joints, polygonal clipping, texture-warping or correction. The old problem of covering up joints, such as knees, elbows, etc., is over. These characters are smooth, silky creatures that look more like liquid motion than anything else. The developer's choice to work with solid color textures enables faster processing times, and yet never did I feel as if they don't contain enough detail. Additionally, while the characters are zipping around the arenas, the blinding level of lighting effects, transparencies, explosions, fire effects, and water effects are all running perfectly, adding a killer sense of action and realism.   All this praise aside, PowerStone did have its share of problems which kept the score from running through the roof. Mind you, not many, but a significant few. While fighting, my most frustrating moments came when I accosted my enemy and freed up a stone, only to see it fling off screen! More often than not, you can't see where the newly freed powerstones have flung, and sometimes the enemies actually reach them before you do! Drat! That sucks. Skilled or not, if the camera angles pulled back a fraction more, you could at least reap the benefit of the beating you just gave.    Additionally, while PowerStone may bring in the new way of fighters, it's old school in a couple of ways. Like many 16-bit or even 32-bit brawlers, PowerStone is short on single-player gameplay. It's really a two-player game at heart. The one player mode is a pretty quick study, and can be beaten relatively painlessly. Thankfully, players can switch up their difficulty levels to challenge themselves. But the AI isn't that good at the most difficult levels. Adding to that argument, there aren't enough gameplay modes for one player. Look at PlayStation's Bloody Roar 2, Tekken 3, or even Street Fighter Alpha 3; there are tons of ways to keep gamers playing with only one player. Here, gamers get Arcade mode, Versus, Options, and PowerStone Collections, a treasure chest goodies to reward you after beating the whole game.    The other big stickler is that PowerStone isn't that well balanced. Character balance is troublesome in some areas. The Native American Galuda is strong and powerful but way too slow. The other heavyweight Gunrock is quicker, making him far more desirable in the long run. I don't like the big guys in any fighting that much, but I played to the end with both of these guys and Galuda is torture to win with. When a good fast character such as Ayame comes into play, Galuda is quickly history. Even though you can master him with timing, I just isn't worth it. Also, some of the Super Attacks aren't equal in power. Rouge, Falcon, and Ayame's super attacks are nearly unstoppable, while Galuda's and Jack's left something to be desired.   And finally, PowerStone could have used more characters. Eight regular and two bonus, for a total of 10? What's with that? The game needs more balance than exists if only 10 characters are selectable. Soul Calibur, for instance has more than 19+ characters.   In the end, despite its minor problems, I loved PowerStone. It's engaging as all get out. I just haven't been this excited about a fighting game in ages. With Sega's first batch of games looking so killer, one particular genre is stunningly strong. The system already has top-notch fighting games. Hell, with one swift stroke, PowerStone or Soul Calibur easily wallop any fighter on Nintendo 64. Throw in Ready 2 Rumble, and you might as well throw that old cart system in the gutter if you're a fighting fan.   PowerStone is deceiving, too. It's not the deepest fighter ever, but it's by no means shallow. The depth isn't in the super moves or the hand-to-hand combat. It's in the timing and variety of attacks. Spin around a pole and jump attack into your opponent, and pick up a flame thrower to finish him or her off. Or just throw chairs at him all day. That'll work. This game has been well tested; it's professionally refined in most every way, and you can see that in the little details. The levels with animated backgrounds and interactive areas are especially noticeable. Play through to the one with the meat grinder, the pirate ship, or the breakable windows, and you'll see what I mean. For any true fighting fan, PowerStone is a must-have Dreamcast game. Go get it.   - Douglass Perry, IGN.com", "date": "Sep 9, 1999"}
