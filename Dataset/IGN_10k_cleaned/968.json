While it doesn't have the popularity of the NFL, it has garnered some recent attention because many of its stars have recently gone on to fame in the NFL, with the most recent being Kurt Warner.   As the Quarterback for the St. Louis Rams, Warner led his Cinderella team to victory in the Super Bowl and won the league's MVP award, all just shortly after having a career playing for the Iowa Barnstormers in the Arena Football League. With the recent increase in awareness of Arena Football and the rise in popularity of Kurt Warner, it's not that big of a surprise to see this game, Kurt Warner's Arena Football Unleashed.   Gameplay At its heart, this game is essentially the same as NFL Blitz. The most significant differences have to do with the dissimilarities with the sports of NFL Football and Arena Football League. This simply means that instead of the 100-yard field and other rules you've come accustomed to with the NFL, Arena Football Unleashed is loosely based on the rules of the AFL.   Meaning that the field is only 50 yards in length, there are walls alongside the sidelines and balls are live if they bounce off of them until they hit the ground, and there's no punting. There are also nets on the sides of the uprights of the field goal posts, and balls kicked off of them are live and can be recovered by either team. Though, the rules in Arena Football Unleashed are only loosely based on the real AFL rules since this is only a Blitz-style representation of the sport.   While a new version of Blitz with different rules, the real AFL teams, might not seem like a bad thing, it definitely is in this particular case. For a variety of reasons, the game doesn't play nearly as well as Blitz. Firstly, none of the plays seem to be as well thought out as they were in Blitz and come off as being somewhat random.   This is mostly likely the result of really shoddy computer artificial intelligence (AI) for the CPU opponent and your CPU-controlled teammates. Many times during the game, before and after the snap of the ball, some of the CPU-controlled players will be seen shaking left and right rapidly, as if they were having some sort of a bad trip. Seeing this just makes one think that the game was most likely rushed and not really finished.   Players will also encounter AI problems with the way the computer runs its plays on offense. In most cases, the QB will run sporadically to the left or right of the field and will let loose a random pass within a mere second or two after the ball is snapped. In most cases, it'll be to a receiver being covered by a pack of defenders and will either be tipped or dropped for an incomplete pass. The only real time the CPU will generate offense is when the tipped pass is caught by one of the other Wide Receivers, who will then get some additional yardage out of it. Otherwise, unless the player calls a lot of full blitzes or rushes in with cornerbacks, the computer will rarely make throws to open wide outs.   The game does have some redeeming qualities in its multiplayer support, but it still fails in the end because it's still plagued with glitches and the gameplay feels too random. It's just not that fun of a game and anyone looking for a fun arcade football game will be better suited playing either version of NFL Blitz instead of Arena Football Unleashed.   Graphics Even though it seems to be based on the NFL Blitz engine, the game doesn't look as good as either of the Blitz games on PlayStation. The backgrounds and the player models both appear to be less detailed and less polished than they were in Blitz.   This might be partially caused by the fact that the game's camera angle is much close to the field, so the players are a lot larger looking than they were in Blitz, making it easier to spot the abnormalities. But, if that is the case, it was a horrible decision by the design team to go that route.   Overall, the game just looks really unclean and unpolished. The only redeeming quality is that it moves at a fast pace and there are not really any noticeable slowdown or framerate problems.   Sound The audio in the game is basically your standard arcade football game stuff. There's wacky commentary, the occasional weird comment out of the stands, fast-paced rock music, and over-the-top sound effects. While there's nothing wrong with it and it fits the game perfectly, there's also nothing special here that does anything to enhance the game.  The idea behind this game isn't a bad one. Anyone who has watched Arena Football on television, or better yet, live from the stands, will probably agree that it is one amazingly fast and exciting sport. It seems like the perfect sport to be made into a videogame. What's more, the NFL Blitz engine would seem like the perfect engine to use to try and replicate the sport's fast pace. However, in the case of this game it just didn't work out one bit. Firstly, while it seems based on Blitz, the actual game engine seems more like a poor man's Blitz. The polygonal models aren't quite as sharp as in Blitz, the field looks worse, and the AI of the computer is just messed up. The game just seems unpolished and unfinished. CPU players on your team and the CPU-controlled team will often start gyrating back and forth like they're having some sort of seizer, both before the ball is snapped and after. The game also doesn't seem as balanced or fine-tuned as either of the NFL Blitz games. The CPU doesn't seem to ever actually run plays, but instead just randomly throws passes to any receiver on the field, whether he's open or not. Most plays are over within just a few seconds because the QB will get rid of the ball so quickly and never let the play develop. It's just a mess. Playing Kurt Warner's Arena Football was painstakingly difficult, and it wasn't just because the game was bad. What hurt the most was that the idea behind the game was actually quite promising; it was just implemented horribly. There's really no reason to buy this game, even if you're a huge fan of Arena Football.", "date": "May 31, 2000"}
