There's not even a Peter Graves. Even with those tremendous omissions, the latest stealth-action game from Atari, developed by Paradigm, comes off just slightly north of decent. It streamlines a lot of the controls and functions that may have intimidated gamers who stumbled through Splinter Cell or Metal Gear Solid 2.   However, for serious fans of the genre, this simplification of the stealth concept presents a problem. If you want a new kind of stealth challenge, this isn't it because there's far too much handholding going on throughout Operation Surma. For everyone else however, this latest Mission Impossible game isn't a bad way to spend the few hours you'll have between your other holiday games especially if you want to spend more time with the M:I characters introduced in the recent movies.   Gameplay  There's a treacherous plot in motion by evil forces all over the globe involving scientists, high technology and security leaks that you, as an operative of the Impossible Mission Force must solve. To this end, Ethan Hunt boasts more specialized weapons and gadgets than both Sam Fisher and Solid Snake. There are the super binoculars that can zoom in over great distances, take pictures and eavesdrop on potential targets. The EWG lets you disable cameras, track bugs and throw noisemakers all in one convenient pistol-shaped package.   These two items alone would've stuffed the knapsack of a poorly equipped agent who would've needed a separate item for each function. And that's the thing that ultimately undid a lot of the fun for us in Mission: Impossible. There was a purpose for everything and everything had a purpose plus it was extremely obvious when it came time to use the different items. It might be that as the subgenre of stealth action continues to evolve and grow, a room full of guards with alarms blaring just isn't as intimidating as it once was. The trial-and-error element of figuring your way out of trouble in Mission Impossible just isn't very daunting for the most part.    You get the now standard practice of timing your movements with guard routines, reading the vision cones of cameras and guards and what we like to call alarm management. This last bit is especially important in MIOS because the game is initially generous with the alarm deactivation panels scattered throughout a level, usually near places where enemies will find you. Sound off an alarm? No problem, just find a deactivation panel and all of a sudden a whole base that was scrambling to meet a threat is standing down and going back to whatever they were doing before. The stress is you'll only have a limited amount of time to deactivate the panel before the mission is aborted.   The end result is you can trigger an alarm --hitting a tripwire, getting caught on camera, scaring guards-- and then sprint to a deactivation panel before it's too late and then go on about your business. At times it can end up looking like one of those classic cartoons where the bulldog/cowboy/coyote has to repeatedly run away from the house of a sleeping king/ogre/ostrich to detonate a giant firecracker given to him by the mischievous mouse/spider monkey/praying mantis that he's trying to catch. Funny stuff sure, but it just seems a little silly that a secret agent could get away with setting off alarms repeatedly in some high security area.   The variety of actions you can pull off with Ethan Hunt is impressive and in line with what we've seen before in stealth-action games. Climbing along pipes, dropping down on enemies from above and judo chopping enemies from around corners are all very handy and are applied in different ways throughout the game. Sneaking through a complicated maze of laser beams using all of your stealth abilities is a good example. The problem is, the game is too linear for our tastes. One little deviation from the path or what's expected of you and you're starting over from the last checkpoint. You're just not as free to solve things in your own time and manner as you should be. Gathering evidence has to be done in a certain way and that's it, so using trial-and-error until you first figure it out and then get it right is a little disappointing.   One of the strengths of the game is the intuitive control system for the gadgets that allows you to keep weapons --for example-- equipped for surprise encounters, yet you can still easily interact with other objects in the game world that require other specialized equipment. The ELP and laser cutter are two great examples of gear that will automatically be equipped when you approach a control terminal or steel door that needs to be hacked into or cut through, respectively.    Ethan will instantly pull out that item and start using it when you hit the action button, but whatever you had deliberately equipped to his hand before you approached the door or terminal will be at the ready as soon as you're done hacking or welding. You can, of course, equip these items but it's extremely convenient knowing you don't have to. Even though it makes an already easy game, a little bit easier, this contextual inventory/equip system should certainly find its way into other stealth action games on the way.   Other than this Mission Impossible is straight up solo stealth-action with a little more focus on hand to hand combat than either SC or MGS. Button mashing your way through little scuffles feels strangely satisfying since most games of this type don't allow you to get your hands dirty. In MIOS, it's presented as another way to simply take control of the situation. If you've set it up so that you can get the drop on an unsuspecting baddie, why not reward you with a nice four or five hit combo that makes you look like the lethal weapon you are? They did, so don't ask.    Graphics  This game looks well enough with decent character models and better than average animation sequences. There's just nothing that stands out and the user-controlled camera can be a bit of a problem.   There's good quality lighting and shadows but this game certainly isn't going to make anybody forget Splinter Cell. Ethan's character model is surprisingly detailed with all kinds of intricate textures on his stealth uniform. When you use the super-binoculars you get spiffy looking blur effects when the binocs rack from far objects to close ones and back again. But the camera during the third person elements of the game remains a huge problem.   The camera keeps Ethan on screen well enough, but it seems to wobble, for lack of a better word, a bit off of its vertical axis for some reason when you start manipulating the dual analog stick. Moving Ethan is fine on the left stick and moving the camera on the right stick is fine too. It's just when you start doing complicated moves with both during the heat of battle that things get a little sketchy.   Sound  Tom Cruise's reluctance to throw his likeness into a videogame is really starting to get on our nerves, but in MI:Operation Surma this simply lets the voice acting of Ving Rhames stand out even more. The music is well done as well with variations of the classic television show's theme song scattered throughout. No Limp Bizkit or Metallica really isn't that bad after all.   The application of sound is better than expected as well with surround effects being used here and there. You also get to use Ethan's binoculars to listen to any characters you line up in its crosshairs. It's almost like reading their minds because they think nobody is listening.Mission Impossible isn't a bad game but there's no denying that it does very little better than anything that's come before it. Combine that with the fact that another Splinter Cell is just around the corner and EA's next James Bond is going to look and feel a lot like a stealth game and there's just not a lot here for Ethan Hunt to hang on to, let alone gamers.The heavy focus on gadgets is good fun for a little while, but there's just never that immersion that I think has become required for games in this category. You're doing an awful lot of sneaking in stealth games so the developers have to give us plenty of atmosphere and intangibles to keep us in the mood. In between using the gadgets, there's just not enough of that  for me in Mission Impossible Operation Surma.It's worth a rental if you're a stealth junkie or an unstoppable Ving Rhames fan. Other than this, you'll need to take a huge leap of faith if you think this is going to satisfy your M:I movie or stealth-action cravings.", "date": "Dec 11, 2003"}
