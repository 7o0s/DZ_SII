For subscribers to Cingular and Sprint, wrestling fans can download WWE RAW, but Verizon Wireless users get WWE Smackdown. The game follows the exploits of five WWE superstars as they grapple for the championship, detailing each chop and body slam that unfolds in the furious series contests.   Although WWE Smackdown offers five WWE superstars -- John Cena, Charlie Haas, Booker T, Kurt Angle, and Rey Mysterio -- only Cena is available from the initial download. In order to unlock the other wrestlers, you must play through a series of tournaments no fewer than four times. This sounds a bit excessive from the outset, but the wrestling system is solid enough that fans will likely at least give the game a couple run-throughs.   The wrestlers have individual speed, power, and technique stats, as well as their trademark finisher. While the controls may be fairly uniform, which is good for ease of play, you can definitely detect that each wrestler has their advantages and disadvantages.   All moves are mapped to the number pad. Movement is handled with ~1,~ ~4,~ ~5,~ ~7~ -- which is definitely a bit odd. When you want to move up, it's hard to not immediately go for the ~2~ key. Attacks are mapped to ~3,~ ~6,~ and ~9,~ which isn't a bad set-up, as you are able to quickly decide on heavy attacks versus basic moves. From these keys, you can enter grapples and try to wrestle the other superstar to submission. I really liked seeing the ability to climb turnbuckles, as that's such a pivotal part of the ~sport,~ and I've played mobile wrestlers where the move wasn't included. As you smack and beat on the other superstar, you juice up your finishing move meter, which can then be called on in either desperate situations to buy time or finally pin a weary opponent.   WWE Smackdown offers a nice trio of play modes: Arcade, Tournament, and Unlimited. Arcade is a quick match, while Tournament enters you into one of the multiple bout challenges to win the title and unlock a superstar. Unlimited offers some frenzied fun, as you take on as many comers as possible before you are finally worn down and pinned.   The wrestlers in WWE Smackdown are somewhat smallish, but there is no way to mistake their identities. Mysterio's mask, Cena's jeans shorts (which have to go, it's just too Marky Mark for the character), and Angle arrives with a chrome dome. The ring always looks the same, dressed up with a little Smackdown flair. The audio is lacking, though, with just some basic melee sounds. Some digital audio would have been nice to see here.  WWE Smackdown is a solid thumb wrestler for WWE fans, which is just my way of saying that if you don't plop down in front of the TV to watch these dudes in action, steer clear. I wish the starting line-up was a little thicker -- I mean, what if you just hate Cena? What if you wanna be Booker? Why do you have to work for it? Why not have all five available, then hide a couple extras? The action moves at a solid clip, and once you get the controls, it's pretty natural to go through the motions of slap, grapple, finisher, pin.", "date": "Nov 11, 2005"}
