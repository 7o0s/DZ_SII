{"name": "Namco Museum 5", "name_review": "Namco Museum Vol. 5", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/11/26/namco-museum-vol-5", "text": "If you're a retro gaming freak, the Namco Museum series has been a godsend. What with all the classic Namco arcade titles, plus some you've never heard of, all assembled in five discs, you know you can't go wrong. Granted, some are better then others, and some, like Vol. 5 here, have some gems you may not have heard of before.  Top of the list of known games is Pac-Mania, a late-80s version of Pac-Man that puts the game in a pseudo-3D, isometric perspective. Pac-Man can jump, which takes the point out of the game, but to make things more difficult there are more ghosts. It's alright, but not the reason to buy the game.  Shooter fans may remember Dragon Spirit, a top-down affair. It's a lot like 1942, but with a dragon instead of a plane. Your dragon also has the ability to drop bombs, which gives it a distinctly Xevious-like feel. Metro-Cross is also here, a game you may or may not remember. Your jump-suited character runs from left to right across the screen, jumping rolling barrels and riding on skateboards. Both these games are OK, but again, not the reason to buy.  The real meat of Vol. 5 lies in two titles, Baraduke and Legend of Valkyrie. Baraduke is a very strange shooter, where a man descends through monster-filled caverns. The monsters are surreal and very creepy, and give the title an odd feel you don't normally find in games like this. Legend of Valkyrie is also cool, and deserves to be seen. With cartoonish enemies, and some pretty impressive scaling effects, it's the definite stand-out of the collection.  Unless you're a Namco fiend, or love the old games, you may not really find Namco Museum Vol. 5 all that interesting. But if you're like me, and love all things retro, it's worth getting as a delightful look back at a simpler time.  Adam Douglas", "date": "Nov 26, 1997"}
