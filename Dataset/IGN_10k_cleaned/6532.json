Test Drive 5 boasted the best cars, Need for Speed III looked the best, and Powerslide had the best handling. But even with this load of new titles, the PC was missing a good old fashioned arcade racer that could deliver the feel of a Crusin' USA or a S.F. Rush. All of that has changed with UbiSoft's release of SpeedBusters, a quirky little arcade game with all of the graphics and sound depth you'd expect from a PC title, but with all of the gimmicks (secret tracks, hidden cars, and short cuts) that you'd expect to find in a console racer.  Speed Buster's story is obviously an attempt at rationalizing a way for racers to get rewarded for speeding instead of penalized. According to the intro screens (which set a new low in FMV sequences, by the way) a local law enforcement officer has won the lottery and the influx of money has made him a little bit crazy. Now he sits in speed traps waiting for speeders to come by and pays them instead of putting them in jail. Oh well, no one really expects much plot out of a racing game anyway.  Once you get past the opening screens (did I mention how bad they are?) you'll be given the choice of either racing arcade style or entering into a championship. If you've got a few friends handy, you can also start a network game as well. In arcade mode, you'll pick a car and a track, select the weather conditions (rain, fog, or dry) and time of day (day and dusk are your only options here) and jump into a traditional arcade race where you must beat the clock to each checkpoint in order to continue racing. The championship mode offers a bit more depth. Here you'll have to buy a car with the set amount of cash your given at the start of the game, and purchase any options you want (spoiler, extra nitro, etc.) before you're ready to jump into the circuit race. Between each race in the championship circuit, you'll be given the chance to repair and upgrade your car with any winnings you received during the last race. Since you're awarded money at the end of the race on a formula that multiplies how fast you went past the policemen in the game by a modifier that's awarded to you depending on which place you came in, you'll have to develop a racing strategy unlike that of any other racing game.  Although the game doesn't boast the same level of realism in play that other titles do, it does handle pretty well. Although the game's skidding and spinouts may annoy hard-core players, arcade fans will pick up the game's bouncy ram-n-slam play method fairly quickly. One big problem I did have with the title was the lack of any reverse (that I could find). This means that when you run in a wall, you'll have to spend the next thirty to forty seconds trying to turn past it before you get back on track. This is made even more irritating by the fact that a loss of only a couple of seconds can cost you the entire race.  Speed Busters looks much as you would expect any arcade racer to with lush car graphics and beautifully detailed objects that get foggier in the distance. The cars in the game are designed with a strange blend of future tech lines and old-school bodies that give the race a very distinctive feel. You can make the cars even more distinctive by using the game's paint or skins options which give you choices that range from standard black to weird Dada doodles and medic symbols. Although the game runs pretty smoothly most of the time, we did run into some trouble with our Monster II board that took a little sorting out. In the end though, the title ran fairly well even at its highest detail levels.  Speed Busters succeeds very well at what it's designed to do  provide a quick and dirty racing experience that's all about fun and not at all about reality. Better still, it manages to keep you entertained by offering up loads of secret hidden shortcuts, tracks and cars for those who spend enough time with the game. If you've been looking at the recent titles released for cartridge systems longingly, Speed Busters maybe just the game you've been waiting for.  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Jan 7, 1999"}
