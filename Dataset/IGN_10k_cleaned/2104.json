This latest offering from Shrapnel Games, while it does contain a few decent concepts, is poorly executed and surprisingly unrewarding. Doing away with resource harvesting and base construction, Remote Assault lets you focus on getting your army to beat the crap out of the other army in small scale engagements. Although it attempts to diverge from the normal real-time strategy model, Remote Assault winds up seeming flat and uninspired. I admit that I applaud some of the concepts behind the game but the overall effect is a paradox of frustration and boredom.  A very detailed system of unit design gets your hopes up. The game models all sorts of factors for each of the units within your army. Different armor facings, separate damage models for each system, ammunition levels mean you need to be keenly aware of the status and orientation of each unit. All of this information is presented in a sidebar that is only comprehensible after much practice.  Command is handled largely through groups. In other words, instead of directing each unit individually, you can control them in groups of up to ten or so (although five or six seems to be the norm). While the actual particulars can get a bit muddy, the process of moving units around the map is painless. Units seem best used in line formations and the control scheme makes setting up the geometry of your tactics very simple. Simply drag a line on the field and tell your units to form up along it.  Fortunately you don't necessarily have to command each unit to fire. You can adjust various behavior factors to control how aggressive your units are. This is a really intricate feature that allows you to fine-tune unit autonomy. At the default level, they will fire on most enemies they see. Selecting individual targets for individual units is more difficult. Since I like to rely on concentration of fire to take out enemies one by one, this is especially frustrating.  The units themselves are really generic. Various types of tanks, APVs and helicopters are pretty much interchangeable with speed and range in inverse proportion to weapons and armor strength. Unarmed vehicles are used purely for reconnaissance. Artillery is useful in a support role and resupply trucks must be available to reload all of your vehicles. For some reason the game includes RABs -- ~chicken-legged robots~ instead of regular soldiers. Since nothing else in the game seems even vaguely suggestive of a futuristic setting (except the date 2063 at the top of the briefings), this seems kind of odd.   You'll command all of these units (rarely more than a dozen separate squads at a time) on non-descript maps. Terrain is usually green and flat with some small forests and hills scattered about. True line of sight and fog of war modeling make reconnaissance a necessity. The only other features are roads and rivers that have a notable effect on movement.  The terrain, like the rest of the game, is really much too monotonous.  Camera control, which initially seemed kind of poor, got much each easier to manage the longer I played the game. The camera has a much greater range of movement than that in most other 3D games. Given that limited camera movement is one of my biggest pet peeves with the current crop of RTS games, this was a welcome feature. The extremes of both zoom and tilt are really appreciated here. Still the camera twist function too often results in accidentally scrolling the map. No, I am not an idiot and can work around the problem but it shouldn't be happening in the first place.   But what you're looking at is hardly worth the effort to get the camera set up. Trees look like little bushes, roads turn at sharp angles and the edges of the map drop off into empty blackness. You can almost count the polygons on the vehicle models. The explosions themselves are well done but the machine gun effect animation looks like the tanks are throwing ping-pong balls at each other. The rocket effects are better (especially the MLRS) and the explosions and accompanying smoke are average. Given everything else in this game, average seems really good.  The game ships with two campaigns and a set of single missions that seem suspiciously like missions from the campaigns. Although the setup is a second civil war in America there's not much context here. Normally I don't have a problem with that. It's kind of a vague war you're fighting but the detached nature of the conflict makes it seem somehow more engaging.  I suppose that if you've got a P266MHz with a Voodoo 1 and are really looking for a purely tactical RTS, then Remote Assault may be for you. Still, I can think of hundreds of ways you can put your $40 to better use. Those of you who simply won't take our advice are more than welcome to purchase the game at Shrapnel's website.  Don't say we didn't warn you.  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
