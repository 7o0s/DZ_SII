In the first Dino Crisis, an elite group of SWAT-like militia learns of a time project that's gone haywire on a remote island, and they're called into investigate. Although the game was designed much like Resident Evil, players mostly ran from dinosaurs and found themselves frustrated by the lack of action and increasing limited control virtually unchanged since the first Resident Evil.    With player complaints of not enough action, Capcom took Dino Crisis 2 in a different route, modifying the RE design by speeding things up, placing lots of huge guns in players' hands, and turning the whole thing into an action-adventure romp. While some people liked it, others hated it (and apparently it didn't sell with beans, though there might be other reasons for that, which is an entirely different story).    Dino Crisis 3 is supposedly appearing on Xbox, though that's been the case for about 19 years now, (just kidding) it was announced about two years ago, and nobody has ever seen a single iota on it. So what happens? Capcom flips the R&D microwave on, and presto, a brand new game flops out, using the Dino Crisis universe, but it's not a sequel, it's not a prequel, it's what called a forgettable, a drop in the bucket, or it's formally known as Dino Stalker, a hodge-podge of first-person shooter aspects, smashed into the middle of a slow-ass adventure, using the light gun, and with a story that is about as fresh as a McDonalds Cheeseburger on a slow Sunday.   Gameplay  I'll make this brief, folks. Dino Stalker is an oddball light-gun game using the first-person perspective and plays like a minimally improved version of Resident Evil Survivor. Yeah, remember that old PS clunker? The one that essentially made a mockery of all of the good Resident Evil games with its horrible control, poor story, bad looking graphics, and awful delivery? Well, Dino Stalker adds a bit to the recipe by permitting other territories than Japan to play it with the Namco light-gun (Survivor wasn't GunCon compatible because of the proximity to the Columbine Shootings) and it enables players to move around the area. The Dpad on the butt of the GunCon enables movement, the side buttons enable strafing, and the button on the bottom of the hilt switches weapons. Every button is used.     So, what's the fuss? Every button is used. After the first mission, your hand is in pain. The Carpel Tunnel syndrome you didn't have before throbs in fiery extended agony as if to say hello, and you have just started. Your hand stretches into positions you didn't know existed like a Chinese contortionist, your fingers are purple with rage and bitterness like Matt Caamassina when he sees Fran Mirabella on any given morning, and your mind is dulled by the inane experience of it all, like me while playing the game. In the dozen-plus levels you play through, the slow-paced, awkward control is not only annoying but it hurts you. That's just the opposite of why I play games; see, I like to escape from pain, nor wallow in it.   But at least there is some comic relief, and for the pure sake of flat-out lunacy, this game may be worth you while. You begin by watching a CG introduction. You're a World War II fighter pilot whose plane has just shot down, and just as the enemy venomously aims the spinning propeller of his plane at your falling body, time freezes. You wait helplessly as the entire world stops. Then instantly, you have been transported to another sky, one in which Pteradactyls fly by in flocks; one in which a gun appears magically in your hand; one in which a weird computerized wrist gadget appears on your forearm. Guns? Pteradactyls? Attacking Pteradactyls? What else is there to do, but shoot? And shoot you do.   For the first several missions you won't find what?s going on, you'll just shoot dinosaurs. It's fun for about ? hour, and then your hand tells you it's over. But the story gets better. You learn that you're in a time warp, a land of the lost so to speak, wherein the dinosaurs are run by a leader dinosaur who sees you as the obstacle standing in their way of peaceful existence. Naturally, you'd just like to go back to 1941 and fight Japanese fighter pilots, but once you meet a sexy young blond woman, it's time for testosterone-filled RESCUE mode!    In short, the same scientist who messed you up big time in Dino Crisis has left a legacy, and these dinos, who were supposed to be transported from the past to the future, and then back again, are stuck in this limbo for the time being. So, as you defend yourself from being slaughtered you're supposed to help your slim new female friend, send the dinos back to their time, and get back to fighting in 1941. Piece of cake, right? Yeah, if only you didn't want to lop off your own hand to escape the misery you're sure to ensure.   Well, after about one to two levels of this hand-wrenching goodness, you may wonder whether it would simply be better playing Time Crisis 2 again. (And the answer is ~yes,~ it would be time better spent.)  If the annoying control doesn't send you to the doctor, and the hilarious storyline doesn't make you feel that watching Scrappy Doo re-runs would be a far more intelligent endeavor, the simplistic, redundant gameplay will. You know what Dino Stalker really reminds me of? It feels like a spin off of the mini-gun games in Dino Crisis 2, only this is an entire game based on that premise.    Graphics and Sound  Ever see low-resolution CG? Dino Stalker looks like it was designed as a PlayStation game and that it only recently made the transition to PlayStation 2. The low resolution CG, which is practically a dichotomy in and of itself, and the mundane visuals are nothing to write home about.    The world is filled with basic jungle textures and structures, blastible, destructible rocks, crates, and other destructible items, and small, medium, and large dinosaurs. As always, the dinosaurs are really the coolest things around, ranging from brontosaurs to Raptors, T-Rex-like carnivores, and various swimming creatures. It's an average looking game at best, and that's putting it nicely.   As for the sound, the game does indeed have it. Giant dinosaurs roar, rocks are basted to bits, and your character's constant monologue of confusion as to what the hell he is doing there (~Where the hell am I~), falls just short of Luke Skywalker's ~NooOoOoOoOoOoooo! Your not my father!~ smoothly handled lines of bliss and relief. Needless to say, you don't want to hear this, never mind connecting this up to any stereo, that is, if you know what's good for you. I know that you bought a light-gun and you desperately want to make use of it with the latest GunCon-compatible game. Well bucko, here's another sappy game you might want to rent  if only you're that desperate and pathetic. I beg of thee -- save your money something, anything else! For the most part, Capcom is a maker of fine games, such as the first three Resident Evil titles, Devil May Cry, the Mega Man series, Strider, and the Onimusha series, which are some of my all-time favorites. But Dino Stalker is not of that ilk, not even closely resembling that ilk. It's a straight progression from the weak-in-the-knees Resident Evil Survivor game, which was a fabulous dud. Stay far away from this my friends, or feel the pinch or having been suckered later. But don't say I didn't warn you.", "date": "Sep 16, 2002"}
