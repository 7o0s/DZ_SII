A psychiatrist named David McNamara arrives in New York to reconstruct the memories of five disturbed kids in a run-down hospital on Staten Island, and along the way has to confront his own psychological quirks as well. His co-workers, Dr. Young and his assistant Tamara, run a very different operation than David, with loads of medication. David's method is a bit more subtle, and as he inches his way further into these kids' pasts via hypnosis, things get pretty intense right up until the end, where you just sort of say, ~Oooookay.~ It's the maddening withholding of information that will keep you playing, like any decent adventure game, but the process of uncovering it is more fun and interesting than what you actually find.   Stepping back from the story's conclusion, let's examine the controls. You will not need a manual to play this game, which is terrific. The left mouse button is your all purpose tool for looking, investigating, taking, and speaking, with context sensitive icons and pop-up labels. Navigating Overclocked is a breeze because this system works so well. The only thing to really add is that you can cancel an item selection by hitting the right mouse button, which is naturally the first thing you'll try in that situation. It's also a pleasure to have nothing to do with the keyboard, unless you want to double-ESC to skip cut-scenes or save your game. Your inventory is always at the bottom of the screen, with large pictures (and again the pop-up labels) keeping it accessible at all times. Overall, a much appreciated simple and intuitive approach, even compared to some other adventure games.      I swear, the mini-bar was empty when I checked in. Most of the time you'll be playing David, as he makes daily trips between his hotel in Manhattan and the hospital via the ferry. The most important skill in the game is knowing how to make good use of your PDA. In addition to using it for phone calls to the detective he's working with or his troubled wife, David makes recordings of all the sessions with each patient and spreads his findings around to stimulate everyone's memories. It's an interesting mechanic, but can get a little old since you're hearing the same dialogue over again. Fortunately, the snippets are only a couple seconds long, so it's not too painful, and it doesn't generally take too long to think who would respond best to the freshest clip.    When you hit on something, David will ~Hmm~ at you, and speaking to the patient triggers a flashback during which you actually become that person in the past. Thus, there are a total of six playable characters. Flashbacks are where most of the puzzle solving comes in, as the kids have to escape this creepy old military facility using standard accessories like crowbars and guns. After learning of their escape, you have them reach back again and again, playing through more of their experiences until you finally find out what was happening on that island base and why the patients were all brought into this clinic after running around half-naked, popping off shots at the sky.    That is a huge cell phone. ...which is where the game goes a bit stale. Without revealing the big shocker at the end, I can say it seemed a bit silly, if not puzzling. The story isn't supremely brilliant to begin with, featuring events that feel more forced than creepy. For example, you have to put a deer out of its misery, and the camera positions itself in such a way that your screen gets spattered with blood. Even so you're compelled to keep going, just to solve the main mystery. Once you do, though, you wonder whether it really all adds up, what it's supposed to mean. The very last scene, in particular, seems too much like a happy-end tack-on, especially after making this whole point that they made.Overclocked gets better than average marks in pretty much every category except load timesfor some reason the cut-scenes will make your disk drive really huff and puff. The haunting main theme (especially if it's dark and you're overtired) and gloom of rainy New York adds an appropriate layer of anxiety to the experience, which is short enough to play in a single weekend day sitting if you're really on the edge of your seat. To spoil the plot would be unfair, which is decent praise in a genre where story is so important. You know the kind of mood it takes for these types of titles, and if you're in it, Overclocked is a decent ride-- even if the final destination is a little strange.", "date": "Apr 10, 2008"}
