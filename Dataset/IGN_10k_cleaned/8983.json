Towns full of wandering, mindless citizens speaking poorly translated text. A young hero, untested and innocent, finds out that his true destiny is to save the world. Sound like a premise you've heard before?   Breath of Fire II claims that distinction now, stealing it away from any others that might have told it before. Because Shining Force is more about the strategy, because Paper Mario is hybridized with a platformer design, and because Sword of Vermilion was just a mediocre mess, Breath of Fire II is a real and focused role-playing experience with familiar themes that take it where you'd expect.   These guys are toast. Ryu is the bright-eyed youth this time around, a blue-haired young man born from a legacy of dragons. Early on, though, he has no hint of his heritage -- he's just a humble ranger, working with his best friend Bow to accomplish menial missions like finding someone's lost pet pig, or taking out the trash. It's an honest living, until fate steps in to send him out on a journey alone, where he begins to encounter more of what the world has in store for him.   Breath of Fire II's story is accessible RPG fare. Though predictable, there's comfort in the consistency -- and this particular JRPG isn't one that everyone has already played in the past, so it'll still be a fresh narrative for many. An obstacle new players have to overcome is some clunkiness in the dialogue and menu screens. The game's text is displayed in far too large a font, the translation is sloppy and lacks proper punctuation half the time, and core characters' names are all limited to only four letters each.   Another potential stumbling block is this adventure's difficulty curve, which almost demands you to invest several hours into level-grinding to power up your warriors over the course of the journey. This process can be a bore, but it's sped along by the game's inclusion of an ~Auto battle~ option. Simply highlight ~Auto~ and press A at the beginning of a battle and you'll then be able to watch the combat unfold, hands off, while the AI makes your decisions for you.   The cast of characters you ultimately end up meeting and recruiting is diverse and fun, from the cat-woman Katt, to the frog warrior Jean, to the massive sentient armadillo Rand. Four characters can be sent into the battle lineup at once, and you can rearrange their position on the field in relation to one another -- tank characters can stand on the front lines to absorb the brunt of the enemies' blow, while distance fighters and supportive healers can hang back behind to do their thing.Overall, Breath of Fire II is a solid, enjoyable RPG experience that earns just a little more distinction by the fact that it's arrived with few other competitors when it originally saw release. Though it's not a role-playing masterpiece on the level of Final Fantasy VI or Chrono Trigger, Breath of Fire II is still a game that fans of those more notable titles would enjoy.", "date": "Sep 5, 2007"}
