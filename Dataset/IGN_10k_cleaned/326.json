After publishing Human's disappointing F1 Pole Position back in 1997, French publisher Ubi Soft takes a second shot at Formula 1 racing on N64 with the self-developed Monaco Grand Prix. Thankfully, the in-house developed console follow-up to the popular F1 Racing Simulation for PC is a better game on all counts -- even though it lacks the all important FIA license.Since Japanese publisher Video System has locked down the official Formula 1 driver and car licenses in an exclusive multi-year deal, Ubi Soft's game sadly only features made-up driver and team names. To at least partially make up for the lack of licenses, Ubi has signed on the Automobile Club de Monaco as well as a number of official sponsors (like Schweppes and Castrol) to lend a bit more authenticity to the game. Of course, die-hard F1 fans can also edit all the driver names to recreate the actual lineup (backed up to the cartridge's EEPROM, without the need of a Controller Pak) -- but there is no fix for the fake team names, generic machines and bogus car decals.Luckily, Monaco Grand Prix gives the officially licensed competition a run for its money and actually manages to recreate the feel of F1 better than both F1 Pole Position and F-1 World Grand Prix -- minus the disqualification scandals and fractured foot bones, of course.Features 16 international professional tracks 22 cars on screen at the same time Three levels of difficulty Arcade and sim control option. Customizable car configurations EEPROM (4k) saves configs, driver stats to cart. Two-player split-screen races Rumble Pak and Controller Pak compatibleGameplayThe title ~Monaco Grand Prix~ may be a bit misleading. In addition to speeding down the 3.367 km long circuit that links Monte Carlo, the harbor and Monaco, MGP sets out to recreate a full F1 season on 16 authentic, international tracks  just like its licensed brethren. Before jumping into the game, players first decide whether they prefer sim controls or the slightly more forgiving (but still fairly ~simy~) arcade setting. However, only if you select simulation will you be able to access the game's best feature, the Career Mode and be able to progress through the game's three skill levels; amateur, pro and expert. Monaco Grand Prix features the following lineup of modes: Single Race: Race on any of the 16 different tracks using the team/car of your choice. You can customize everything from the weather to the number of cars on the track. You have the choice of driving qualifying runs or not. If you don't, you'll start off at the end of the grid. Championship: Race a full-fledged Grand Prix season on all 16 circuits. You're not only fighting for personal victory (based on the actual F1 point system), but also for the Constructors World Championship along with your second team mate. In championship mode, you are encouraged to first familiarize yourself with the track using the practice run option. This allows you to tweak your car to perfection until you get it to perform the way you want to. Before participating in the actual race, you need to first qualify for a good grid position. Once you've got your position, it's time for the real thing  the race against the full field of 21 cars. If you car happens to get damaged during the race, you can drive into the pits for repairs. Like in real life, pit interaction is limited to wing repair, tire changes and refueling. Career: This awesome option is only available in simulation mode. If you've played other team-oriented racing games like World Driver Championship, you pretty much know what it's all about. Sign on with one of 11 racing teams and compete in multiple seasons. Depending on your performance, you will be offered new contracts and work your way up to top teams and secure yourself a place in the (EEPROM-backed) MGP Hall of Fame. Time Attack: No fuel consumption, tire wear or damage here  just pure racing for lap records. Dual: A two-player head-to-head race mode that you can play on a horizontally or vertically split screen. Catch-up logic can be toggled on or off. Fun for a while, but it would have been nice to race against other cars as well.Unlike its prime competitor, F-1 World Grand Prix, Monaco Grand Prix sticks with standard analog controls. Sharp turns are executed by pushing the analog stick all the way into one direction (none of that pull down towards you stuff) and like in most racing sims you can't just plow into a sharp curve at full speed and expect to make the turn. Even on arcade setting, gamers must learn to follow the racing line and brake and downshift for turns and when overtaking opponents. Looking to take cheap shortcuts? Don't do it  even if that Hockenheim hairpin turn looks too good to resist. Like in real F1, taking a shortcut that effectively betters your position will get you a time penalty or even a black flag if you're a repeat offender which means immediate disqualification. Yellow flags are also used, but only to alert racers of dangerous situations ahead. However, there is no pace car like in the real Formula 1 and no penalties for overtaking someone while the yellow flag is up  probably wise omissions, unless you enjoy driving slow all the time...As you would expect from a game of its caliber, Monaco GP features full car setup options. Players can adjust wings, suspension, tires, steering, brakes, body height, gearbox, and fuel level to their liking. Along with the weather conditions and the personal stats of the chosen team and driver, the settings directly influence the vehicle handling and play an important part in the ultimate outcome of the races. You can adjust these options using easy-to-understand menus and the effects of the changes are shown on the fly in an on-screen car performance menu.Monaco Grand Prix's realistic features are backed by an excellent physics engine (based directly on Ubi's own F1 Racing Simulation engine), good car AI and responsive steering. Players who were turned off by F-1 World Grand Prix's tough controls (complicated by the static camera) will love MGP's more forgiving and ultimately more natural control schemes. The learning curve is still pretty high for beginning players, but drive a few races with the damage settings on off and do exactly what your opponents are doing and you'll get the hang of it. Thankfully, the game's manual does a great job at explaining how to set up your car, what the different flags mean and how to avoid oversteering and understeering.Like F-1 WGP, MGP offers full car damage. Drivers can lose their tires, knock off their wings, and virtually break every crucial part of their car. Spinouts look great, complete with smoke trails and skid marks, but the actual crashes themselves are only semi-realistic. Collisions with cars or obstacles cause significant damage, but don't expect to see spectacular flips and lots of debris. If your car is damaged beyond a certain point, it will be unceremoniously steered off the track and you drop out of the race. Being able to react and drive around damaged and stalled cars (hey, is that an Arrows?) that are waiting to be pulled off the track is very much a part of F1  it would have been nice if Ubi could have at least built in a delay before the cars roll onto the green.You'll get the most out of Monaco Grand Prix if you get used to shifting gears by yourself, but the automatic transmission setting performs flawlessly as well. Although it will do all the shifting for you, it is still necessary to switch to reverse using the downshift button (Z) to back up after a spinout. You then manually upshift to first gear using R when you want to go forward again. It's second nature if you've use the manual setting before, but I can see how gamers can get confused who have only driven on automatic.GraphicsI think it's fair to say that Ubi Soft has taken Paradigm/Video System's F-1 World Grand Prix as a direct example of what an F1 sim on N64 should look like. From the overall texture design to the way the game draws trees, Monaco GP and F-1 WGP almost look like twins separated at birth. Both games run in low-res (320x240), feature skid marks, smoke and dirt clouds, and lens flare -- but there are a few subtle differences. Whereas the car models are better in WGP, Ubi Soft managed to get their game to run at an overall higher framerate. Although it's still not perfect and bogs down in crowded turns, the framerate never hampers the gameplay  and it should be said that getting the N64 to keep track of 21 cars driving independently on a realistic track without fog is not a small feat. It would have been nice to have an option to switch off filtering and anti-aliasing (low-res games with all filters switched on tend to look overly blurry), though.As the name suggests, the Monaco track is really at the heart of the game. Although all the tracks are well represented, Ubi managed to one-up the competition with the Monaco track and built an accurate virtual duplicate. Everything rings true  from the Beau Rivage incline to the Piscine Chicane. The car models are a decent approximation of a generic F1 machine, but Formula One fans will be disappointed to find that Ubi didn't particularly try to recreate different real-life cars. If GT and rally game developers can get away with putting unlicensed lookalikes into their titles, then surely Ubi could have made their fake McLaren model look more like a real one, complete with the camera module and decals.There are a total of five camera views, including a rear-view (mirror) quick-look function and a graphically well-designed in-cockpit view with working instruments. Beginning players who aren't familiar with the tracks will appreciate the zoomed-out 3/4 view that gives you a good idea of what lies ahead. On the special effects side, MGP features dirt/grass buildup on tires, nice rain and haze as well as good water spray effects. It would have been nice if Ubi could have implemented polygonal pit crews instead of the flat sprites -- and the overall menu design could have used some more work as well, but everything is functional and very intuitive.Although the developers originally intended to include a replay mode, it was sadly cut from the final version to keep framerates high.SoundThe engines sound realistic, albeit a little bit too clean, lacking the throaty roar of a real F1 car. On the upside, there are multiple sound sources -- unlike in F-1 WGP, where only the player's car generates engine noise (with a looping sound sample supplying the rest of the audio), Monaco GP lets players hear the other cars when they pass by in stereo. Pit talk is very limited, mostly due to the fact that the game doesn't feature licensed drivers.Like with most F1 sims, there is no music during the races (chalk it up to lack of system power, but at least N64 owners don't have to suffer through the hokey soundtrack of the Dreamcast version that pops up in the arcade mode). The music that accompanies menu selection and car setup is uninspired and forgettable, but at least it's not annoying.Peripheral SupportThe game backs up settings and driver names to a built-in EEPROM chip but gamers will still need a Controller Pak to save their season data. The game doesn't feature Expansion Pak support (although the extra 4MBs could have easily helped realize a replay mode) and steering wheel support is limited to digital pedals. The Rumble Pak is supported.Monaco Grand Prix took me by surprise. Early versions of the game I was able to play were promising, but framerates were so dismal that I wasn't exactly confident that Ubi could tweak the game to run at passable speeds. Well, the programmers pulled it off and put together a great Formula 1 sim that's easily the best on the console when it comes to handling and gameplay. The control is excellent and enables you to drive just like the pros.If there is one complaint I want to lodge against Monaco GP, it's that it doesn't exactly try to beat its competition by offering something new. The career mode is great, but a game that appeals to a specialized audience yet lacks the official licenses should offer a little more than just the usual lineup of modes. It would have been nice to for once see a four-player mode, a two-player championship mode, an in-depth story mode, or  if the N64's hardware limitations are simply too much to overcome  at least some extra goodies like a decal designer, a classic race mode (like the one found in the Dreamcast version of MGP), or perhaps the newly built Indianapolis track. And where is the Kuala Lumpur track that's part of the '99 F1 Championship? What N64 owners get instead is a bare bones, albeit exquisite F1 racing sim with a great career mode and outstanding control. With Ubi Soft and Video System now collaborating on a new F1 game for the next season, it will be interesting to see if the two companies can combine the attention to detail and wealth of features of F-1 WGP with the excellent handling of MGP to create the perfect F1 sim. Until then, Monaco Grand Prix remains the leader of the pack.", "date": "Oct 19, 1999"}
