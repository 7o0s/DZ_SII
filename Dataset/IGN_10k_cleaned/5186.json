In the ten months that have passed so far, the list of impressive ~A-Level~ games for the PlayStation 2 have been nothing short of staggering. And with titles like Burnout 3, Sly 2, Shadow Hearts: Covenant, Katamari Damacy, and the unbelievable Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, it's no wonder that it's the single best year for gaming since Final Fantasy X, Devil May Cry and Gran Turismo 3 first invaded our systems back in 2001. That stream of high-quality titles show no sign of letting up either, as the first week of November alone brings us even more kickass gaming goodness in the form of Sony's second party IPs that include Killzone, ATV Offroad Fury 3, and Insomniac's intergalactic sequel, Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal. But while opinions may vary on how marvelous ATV and Killzone have turned out to be, I can't help but realize that if there's a single game out there that can give Rockstar's gritty Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas a run for its award-winning money, it's Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal; a game that's nothing short of awesome.   But given the history of the series up 'til now that's not really much of a surprise, is it? If anything, the team at Insomniac Games has proven year after year that they're the masters of making sequels ever better than their predecessors were. 2003's Going Commando, after all, made quite a significant progression when compared to the original. The number of stages, improvements to the weapons, and addition of several RPG-like enhancements added such a profound amount of replay value, that it took home the honor of being named IGN's PlayStation 2 Game of the Year -- something that the first Ratchet and Clank failed to do.   Click For More Images This year, however, Insomniac has gone way beyond the notion of just adding a couple of upgrades or weapons before calling it a day and have implemented an all-new, fully-realized multiplayer feature as well. This new gameplay option isn't just a half-assed tacked-on bonus mode either; it's an extensive, entirely entertaining supplement to the single-player game that, for all intents and purposes, is the best PS2 online head-to-head I've experienced to date. Essentially, it's a Lombax's version of Unreal Championship. But man oh man, is it ever good.   Broken into several different gameplay types, the multiplayer option can be enjoyed in a variety of different flavors: Capture the Flag and Death Match play out as they always have in a million other different games before it: Encouraging players to kill or be killed in a set amount of time or to seize their rival team's flag in the most number of instances. These classic (and still fun) gameplay modes are almost worth the price of admission alone. But it's with the incredibly addicting Siege Mode that gamers will no doubt be spending most of their time. Borrowing ideas from titles like Battlefield 1942 and Star Wars Battlefront, Up Your Arsenal enables players the ability to overtake enemy bases in order to gain complete territorial control -- with all manner of special defenses such as laser turrets and protective robots to help along the way.   Rather than just relying on the CPU's auto defenses and your teammates to assist in your victory, however, Ratchet and Clank 3 also provides gamers with numerous ways to succeed in a proactive way. In addition to a myriad of different weapons that allow players to put some serious hurt on the opposition (including the Sheepinator Gun, an interesting blaster that transforms your enemies into mutton) you'll also be able to hop into several different vehicles that each have their own physics, weapons, and armor ratings. Throw in a host of cool auxiliary add-ons, like the Gravity Boots and Jump Boosters, and you have all the ingredients necessary for some crazy online action.    What makes the multiplayer mode so fun, though, is the fact that it's so incredibly responsive. Taking a cue from first-person shooters and similar games in the genre, Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal provides players with three distinct methods of control -- the original third-person platforming style used in earlier games, a first-person schematic that feels just like Unreal Tournament, and my personal favorite, a fascinating FP/TP hybrid that brings first-person controls to a third-person perspective. This new amalgam of control styles (known as the Lock-Strafe Mode) adds a terrific degree of accuracy to the firing of your weapons and feels a lot more natural than your typical action/adventure. Best of all, players can use this scheme in the single-player adventure as well, and hopefully future developers will start adopting this method (weapon firing on R1, Jumping on L1) for 2005 titles -- it works wonders for high-intensity battles.   The multiplayer entertainment value doesn't solely rest on the shoulders of the control scheme, though, as another one of Up Your Arsenal's strongest attributes is the sheer amount of action that's going on at any one time. In addition to the eight players that are out to kill one another in the online mode (that's four on four if you're curious), there's also a huge amount of CPU-controlled turrets, robots, and other such defensive units blasting away at each other at the same time. Amazingly, this is all going on at a full 60fps (30fps when playing offline split-screen) with full support of the USB headset. It truly feels as though you have a large-scale cartoon war going on and the technology put in place to convey this is truly impressive. My only complaint is that there are only ten multiplayer maps to choose from, but hopefully Sony will support more sometime in the future.   Click For More Images But don't think that it's only the online mode that makes Ratchet and Clank so great. Because longtime fans of the series can already tell you that the franchise was built on a superb single-player experience to begin with and that reality is no different in Up Your Arsenal -- as this third installment has managed to fine-tune the gameplay mechanics to near-perfection. Of course it needs to be understood that on the whole, Ratchet and Clank has almost completely moved away from its status as a platformer. Now it's almost entirely an action/adventure with a few platforming elements and a heavier emphasis on shooting. That doesn't make the game any less enjoyable, though, because if anything else, Up Your Arsenal is a much better game than it has ever been before. Ratchet's reaction time and virtual weight when jumping, for example, feels terrific (no more of that slippy-slidy feeling that we had in the older games) and the faster-paced nature of the enemies makes for a much more exciting selection of missions.   As for the missions themselves, they're more varied than ever and really take advantage of the game's deep universe of characters. Clank, for example, plays a much more prominent role here than he did before; his exciting ~control the robots~ and ~giant mech~ scenarios are found with more frequency in addition to a few other things that are best left for you to discover on your own. And while it's true that the game is still somewhat linear in the design of its stages (a staple of the series), you can still go back and visit them as often as you like -- usually finding all new goodies that you probably didn't know were there previously.   Another nice touch to the mission structure is the addition of several new mini-games. Perhaps the most talked about of which is the new side-scrolling Captain Quark platform challenges. Similar to the old Apogee PC Duke Nukem titles, these addicting little sidequests use some old-school sound effects and a 2D perspective to retell Quark's most famous adventures prior to his meeting with Ratchet and Clank.    The Captain Quark stages are only playable when you collect Captain Quark vid-comics, though, so be on the lookout for them as early as possible -- the search is definitely worth it. You can also expect to find a few ship-related quests and some turret-busting missions in addition to some of the returning underwater swimming assignments and all-new skydiving sequences. The mission variety here is phenomenal.     The primary focus of the game, though, is Ratchet's ability to shoot things savagely with his weapons. In all, there are a host of different guns to choose from (including a few from both the original game and Going Commando), with items like the Plasma Whip and Infector (an item that brainwashes your enemies into attacking each other) sticking out as my favorite new selections. There's even a new Rift Inducer than creates black holes and sucks enemies inside for devastating effects and a Refractor that bounces lasers off an invisible shield to insta-cook your rivals. What helps separate Up Your Arsenal from the rest of the action games with various weaponry, though, is the fact that there's a definite strategy for each of these different attacks. Certain guns will be damn near ineffective against specific opponents, for example, so you had better be ready to use your brain as well as your trigger finger.   Helping you in this regard is a much more streamlined weapons upgrade feature. In Up Your Arsenal, most of Ratchet's weapons now gain experience for up to five different versions of that gun (Going Commando was much more limited), and the effects of each of them are quite extensive. Blast radius, number of rounds, firepower, and ammo limit all increase as you go along, and just like Going Commando so does the visual presentation to represent them. It serves as just another strategic element of the game's vast playability.   Click For More Images But the tactical aspects of Up Your Arsenal don't end with weapon selection -- they're also a big part of your enemy's behavior as well. In an interesting twist that helps add a lot to the progressive difficulty of the game, your Tyrannoid enemies arrive in a host of different varieties: with each of the more advanced versions of the creatures sporting more eyes than the last. But that's your visual clue: as seeing a monster with more eyes is a conscious reminder that it may take more than just a gunshot to eliminate an impending threat. So while a one-eyed creepy may simply run at you while making noises before you blow him into oblivion, a five-eyed monster may search for cover when you shoot at it; or perhaps attack cohesively in a groups. This kind of obvious but effective approach to AI definitely merits mentioning and was a great addition to the series.   The smooth as butter gameplay and gun-oriented strategy are made even better by some of the PlayStation 2's best graphical technology to date. Able to be seen in both widescreen and progressive scan, the character models and environments look terrific regardless of what kind of television mode you run them in. It's easily one of the best looking PS2 titles I've seen this year, and boasts even more onscreen objects and enemies that last year's Going Commando did. This impressive feat is further enhanced by a collection of gorgeous-looking particle effects and some truly satisfying explosions. The animations are just as top notch and provide a great deal of personality for each character in how they move and how their faces react to the onscreen action.   I do have to point out, though, that Naughty Dog's Jak series still has the advantage over Ratchet when it comes to characterization and personality. Don't get me wrong, I love the characters and universe that Insomniac has created with Clank's line of actors, but the artistic style and level of comedy feels a little forced and generic in comparison. When taken on its own merits, however, the game offers more than enough to keep you interested.    Part of the reason that Ratchet's characters overcome its less-inspired character design is thanks to its stellar voice acting and superior soundtrack. Among top tier games like San Andreas, Jak 3, and Legacy of Kain in terms of its audiosUp Your Arsenal manages to capture the personalities of its characters fantastically. Captain Quark in particular is pretty hysterical, with the Bill Clinton-esque Galactic President one of the more endearing characters. Clank's dry sidekick humor is in great contrast to Jak's own sidekick Daxter (for those of you that play both games), while Ratchet's ~Why me?~ delivery is spot on.   I really enjoyed the game's orchestral soundtrack, though. While not quite as good as Going Commando's superb score, it offers a solid selection of movie-inspired themes that are both dramatic and action-packed; providing some of the best original music this side of Final Fantasy. The audio effects are just as impressive, with a wide range of different sounds effectively representing everything from the grumble of stupid level-one monsters to the baritone boom of your 30-strong weapon set. It's definitely good stuff, and it's made even better by some slick encoding that really brings everything together. If you have a quality surround sound system, make sure you crank that sucker all the way up.Of course the most common debate among PlayStation 2 gamers these days is ~Which is better, Ratchet 3 or Jak 3?~ And while I'll leave that debate up to each individual player once both games have been released, I can safely say that Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal is easily the single best effort in that entire series of titles so far. Granted, it would have been a close race if not for the inclusion of Ratchet's online mode, but once that feature has been considered it's all over -- the sheer amount of fun you'll have when playing against seven other people in the ten different maps and various gameplay modes here is almost immeasurable -- it's that damn good.But what impresses me most about Up Your Arsenal is the fact that the single-player adventure didn't suffer in the least. It's just as entertaining, interesting, and fun as the online segment. What's more, is that Ratchet 3 can be picked up and played by just about anyone and be enjoyed equally; offering a viable Christmas alternative for people that are apprehensive about the curse-ridden violent opus that is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. It's only real detriment is the fact that it's a bit on the easy side (easier than Going Commando), but that's really about it. The rest is all gravy, and an unabashed must-own for every PS2 gamer with a pulse. Enjoy!", "date": "Oct 29, 2004"}
