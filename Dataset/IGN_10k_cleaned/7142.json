While some of us quite like the idea of pouncing around on a dance mat to impress potential suitors under the giddy influence of alcohol, we don't necessarily want to sink slowly beneath a torrent of brain hemorrhaging Europap.   Bring on Dance Factory: Codemasters' entry in the dance mat rhythm action genre and a game which does away with the pointless faff of licensing half a dozen songs so infuriating they make you want to stove your brain in with the sharp end of your DualShock. Instead, its single, and utterly genius, gimmick is that you can slap in your own CDs and dance around like nobody's business.    In fact, if you've played and enjoyed any type of dance mat game before, that's probably all you need to know about Dance Factory - oh, and that it works brilliantly.Of course, in the unlikely event that the DDR series and its bastard offspring are still an entirely alien concept, a quick run-down of the basics might be in order. Let's go!   Essentially, the core components of any dance mat game - and Dance Factory plays it entirely by the books - are the four arrows resting nonchalantly along the top of the screen: one up, one down, one pointing left and one pointing right. As the music plays, a combination of secondary arrows (representing beats) fly up the screen, your task being to stamp the corresponding direction on your mat as the rhythm prompts hit the arrows at the top. Do it right and, congratulations, you're a super dance fiend - do it wrong, and you're a shambolic embarrassment with little to no dexterity or coordination. Really, the only thing complicating matters further is the difficulty setting, dictating whether you'll be foot-tapping like your dad at a family wedding or - on the tougher levels - replicating Michael Flatley's River Dance, assuming it had been conceived while his pubic hair was on fire.    That then, is pretty much that. As previously mentioned though, Dance Factory's monumental trick is its ability to convert any of your own CDs into playable tracks. Best of all, it's an incredibly simple process - slot your CD into your PS2 while in the game, select the track (or tracks) you want to convert and - shazam - Dance Factory's off like the clappers. It's all very clever and, by and large, works brilliantly. During our rigourous tests, we threw a veritable smorgasbord of stuff its way. Impressively, Daft Punk, Pulp, Mint Royale, Muse and Kenickie (okay, we haven't really bought that many CDs since the 90s, but we'll get onto that in a moment) all magically transformed into perfectly playable dance-offs - and it's pretty much a no-brainer to note that the limitless potential for personalising your soundtrack roster increases Dance Factory's longetivity infinitely.     If we have to start casting disapproving glances in the direction of anything however, we'd start with the length of time it takes for Dance Factory to convert CD tracks. Approximately one minute doesn't sound like a long time, but that does amount to ten-to-fifteen minutes of downtime if you're after a whole album. Of course, once converted, you can save the game's dance interpretations to your memory card for future use. However, it does mean you'll need to do some careful planning if you're intending to use the game in its natural party environment, and don't want your playmates to be twiddling their thumbs while you go conversion crazy.   For single tracks though, the only negative we can really find is that you're likely to end up with a shocking pile of CDs balanced in front of the telly if you're the kind of person with the attention span of a daffodil. Commendably, Codemasters has been thoughtful enough to provide a little distraction during the conversion process too, in the form of Cubrix - a simple rotate the blocks Tetris-style puzzler. It's an inclusion which is wholly indicative of the thought that's obviously gone into the entire package.    Alongside the usual modes - Normal (dance to a single track of your choice), Endurance (dance endlessly until your legs are bloody stumps with nothing but flailing nerve endings to keep you going), Fitness (dance and watch the calories burn off on-screen) and Record (create and save your own dance sequence for your favourite songs) - there're a couple of other nice features in Dance Factory too. First up, we have some slightly gratuitous EyeToy support - actually, make that 'gruelling'. Plug the fella in and you'll discover a left and right hand marker either side of your four usual arrows. Now, alongside your fancy footwork, you're charged with wafting your mitts around in time to the music too. It's a nice inclusion but, if the exertion and sheer amount of things to keep track of doesn't kill you in a matter minutes, congratulations - you may actually be bionic.   On top of that, there's also a Creature mode, where you can conjour up your own avatar to dance along in the background while you're stomping away - a welcome addition given that Dance Factory's collection of background visualisation 'Themes' accompanying normal play range anywhere from tediously generic to nauseatingly hideous.    Creatures can be decked in a variety of outfits via the game's shop, all purchasable using the points racked-up during standard play. In yet another entirely superfluous twist, creatures can battle against an opponent's critter during multiplayer, if desired. While we're on the subject, if you have dancing buddies, Dance Factory also offers up standard Battle play, Cooperative play and a sixteen-player Tournament mode.   Aside from the aforementioned track conversion time niggle, there're literally two other issues we encountered with Dance Factory. First we noticed that - on extremely rare occasions - our PS2 would freeze while reading a presumably slightly scratched CD. This threw the entire customised dance sequence we were playing off-beat, making progress near-impossible without a restart. Secondly, Dance Factory is pretty much worthless if you don't own any CDs, given that the game comes with a paltry five tracks; featuring The Pussycat Dolls, The Bodyrockers, Kool & the Gang, Rhianna and Tim McGraw. If you're the kind of person whose entire music collection is in MP3 format, then you may as well give up now. Perhaps in future iterations, it might be possible to get Dance Factory to read your digital music stored on, say, your PSP? Who knows.Ultimately, CD collection withstanding, Dance Factory is just about the best dance mat game you're going to find on PS2 - thanks entirely to its impressive track conversion capabilities. Of course, anyone that detests dance mat games should absolutely, completely give this one a wide birth (and you're reading this review, why?). However, any self-respecting fan of the genre should be thrilled with Dance Factory - just think, with its potentially limitless song list, you may never need to buy another dance mat game again.", "date": "Aug 22, 2006"}
