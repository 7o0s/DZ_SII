And it wouldn't be a Disney movie if there wasn't merchandising tie-ins. Enter the Herbie Rescue Rally game, developed by the guys over at Climax. Sure, it's a little late to really be a movie game, but that's because it technically isn't. The game has ditched everything relating to the movies, including Lindsey Lohan (thank God), and the result is a game that has a few kinks in the engine, but ultimately gives a nice, fun ride.    A glance at the game's case would lead players to think that Herbie Rescue Rally is a crazy, Hot Wheels style racing game complete with giant loop-de-loops. While the game does have its share of jumps and stunts, it's hardly as death defying as the cover art. The game does have an epic story line though. Louise Noble must save her family's animal sanctuary from being turned into a dump by the E. Vile corporation. To do so she and Herbie must win a cross state race against Edward Vile himself to win the $1 million dollars it'll take to buy back the sanctuary. Saving cute animals and defeating the man? It's a way better story than the time Herbie went to Mexico to stop that counterfeiting ring. (Herbie Goes Bananas, look it up). The story is told through cartoony cutouts of the characters. The style is really simplistic, a stark contrast to the semi-realism of the game itself. With such a simple style it would have been nice if the characters had more expressions. The two or three each one has don't always match up with that they're saying. Still, the dialogue is fairly well written for what is obviously a game geared towards the too-young-to-really-drive crowd and there's a fair bit of humor in there.    The entire game is light hearted, despite the heavy plot. This is Herbie after all. The races, while set in realistic areas and featuring somewhat realistic cars, still have a lot of kart racer elements. There are powerups to pick up, and speed boosts on every track to keep the action fast paced. Rescue Rally uses the Ridge Racer theory of few tracks, many courses. There are only four tracks in the game, but each one has different paths to open and close, so each time players race on them it's a different course. Each track is very different, and a few of them have special events that trigger during the races, such as tornadoes and avalanches.      The game also features a variety of races during the story mode. Players will compete in four car circuit races, head to head races, time trials and speed trials, the latter two being single car events. The time trial is a race to see how long that player can keep the timer up. By collecting clock tokens on the track, players can add time to the clock and stay in the race. The speed trial is a race to see how far the player can get within a certain time. Hitting the speed boosts becomes a crucial element in this event. Both races are fun in their own right, though not necessarily fun enough to play a major role, which is why they make great interlude races in the middle of the game. It's a change of pace that keeps the game from getting stale.    Unfortunately the game never even gets a chance to become stale, since it's pretty short. The story mode takes a little over an hour to beat, and even though it can be played on three different difficulties, there isn't much incentive to play it again. The developers have added in a separate circuit tournament to the game to extend the playability, as well as a multiplayer mode.    The multiplayer mode is similar to the single player, with up to four player circuit track racing. It does require friends to have the game too, which is a bummer, but it shouldn't be too hard to convince a friend to pick it up. The multiplayer mode has the appeal of offering two additional powerups to the race that aren't featured in the single player game, a great incentive feature that other games ought to copy, instead of offering toned down versions of the game for multiplayer.   Yeah, it feels kind of weird to say that Herbie Rescue Rally is a good game. For a system that is seriously lacking in solid racing titles, it's refreshing to find one that is at least worth playing. Rescue Rally is a solid title, with a lot of great elements, and makes the most of the limited technology to offer a well rounded racing title. It's a shame that the game is so short, and too easy to offer much of a challenge to anyone that actually is old enough to drive.
