Had you been alive, and had you been out shopping, and had you been in a mall in the middle of Manhattan you might have chanced upon a scene. There, desperate for attention, a young and unproven company called Nintendo of America had set up a show.    On display  the NES. On the NES  Baseball.   One of the 18 launch titles to debut alongside the original Nintendo Entertainment System, Baseball was heavily relied upon in the earliest efforts to market the machine. It was a game for the everyman, the national pastime of the country. General passers-by couldn't be expected to know Ice Climber, Mach Rider or Gyromite on sight. But Baseball, sure. Everybody knows Baseball.   And everybody knows baseball players, a fact the young Nintendo street team in New York used to their advantage to add a little celebrity to the show. Major League players like Mookie Wilson and Ron Darling were brought in to play NES Baseball on a giant-sized projector screen amid an array of a dozen other smaller monitors, each one hooked up to an NES. The Mets stars signed autographs, and Nintendo's booth-manning employees got to see some return for their hard work when people who'd normally pay no attention to video games actually came over to give them a shot while meeting the players.   The game itself is simulation, the best representation of a full nine-inning contest available at the time of its first release. By today's standards, it's limited. In 1985, it was robust.   Gameplay focuses on batting and pitching, with fielding the ball handled automatically. When a pop fly soars through the sky, it's hands off the controller  computer A.I. takes over, positioning the appropriate fielder to make the catch.  Only after the ball is caught or picked up off the field does control return to the player, then able to throw to any of the four bases.   Pitching has more depth than first glance would suggest. Fastballs, curveballs and change-ups are all possible through button combinations with the D-Pad. Batting, too, has a bit more strategy than just swinging away  the player at the plate also commands the running game for men already on base.    Six teams are available for players to choose, each one color-coded to represent a pennant-winning club from the mid-1980s. The game had no official MLB license, so gamers in the '80s had to use their imaginations  Team C, clothed in red, was probably meant to be the St. Louis Cardinals.   Today, the Cards are the reigning World Series champions. Back in 1985, they were also in the Fall Classic, playing Game 1 just one day after the NES launch on October 18. They ended up losing that year, but the NES came out a winner  thanks, in part, to Baseball.  Wii Sports Baseball is packed in with every new console sold  strike one against this NES classic. This game has also been re-released recently in a few other places, including an emulated appearance in Animal Crossing for the GameCube and an e-Card version for Game Boy Advance  strike two. But Baseball's important place in Nintendo's history, its two-player support and its still-intact sense of fun keep it from striking out. If you're a fan of hard hits, home runs and horsehide, give Baseball a try  it's less than the price of Cracker Jacks and a ballpark frank.", "date": "Jan 17, 2007"}
