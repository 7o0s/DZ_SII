It's addicting yet difficult game play was a wonderful example of early eighties game design where being a twitch gamer was rewarded over being a gamer who merely knew where to find a shield power up. I love Frogger. I was sad when Levi sold his Frogger arcade machine. I have Frogger as my ringtone. I am a total dork. But as the years go by, and companies try and freshen up beloved video game characters, you end up with something like Frogger Launch. The nostalgia is there, but not the game play.   Frogger Launch, like its predecessors, relies on simple game mechanics. Instead of guiding your frog safely home through tons of traffic or crowded rivers, you have to launch Frogger over obstacles and get him to the landing zone at the end. It's a simple concept, much like the wireless game Skipping Stone, but poor planning and uninteresting game play keep this frog from ever catching any game of the year awards.   To start, pick your frog and then enter an area. Usually each area comprises of three to five stages. Beat all of the stages in that area and you unlock a new character. I've unlocked about five characters now but I don't really notice anything different in regards to their attributes. Each stage has a champion you must beat but merely getting to the end is all it takes to clear the area.   Your character is standing in a giant slingshot on the far left of the screen. Press the OK or center button once and the screen scrolls to the right, giving you a visual overview of where the pads, enemies, trees and other obstacles are. It's a good idea, but unless you have a photographic memory it won't do you much good. Press OK twice and you're ready to go. Press OK to select the amount of force and watch your froggy get launched into the air. But how do you make it all the way to the end of the level? You do this by bouncing off of lily pads, rocks and catfish. Numerous enemies and obstacles are in the way, though, and if you hit one, you lose a life and have to start over.   This is where the game becomes troublesome. Even though you're able to preview where obstacles are and see where bounce pads are, the game screen flies by much too quickly to make any kind of a good decision. Most of it is just luck because if you die, the pads and enemies are in different spots the next time. Pressing up while in the air will inflate your character and slow his descent. Press down and he'll descend quicker. These options are put in there so you can try and hit the bounce pads, but when the game is moving by so quickly, it's really hit and miss. I've completed levels just by managing to bounce off a pad, then pressing up at the top of my launch and praying I manage to float to the end of the stage. There is a status bar at the bottom that gives you some indication of how much further you have to go. I would have liked it if this bar had small icons showing where things were placed on the map. It would have been more fun and I could put the blame on myself for not planning my airtime ascents and descents correctly. As it stands now, I'm just pressing up the whole time and hoping I don't hit anything.   Earn an extra life every time you catch a fly while coins add points to your score. Worms make your frog go faster, but I don't recall ever seeing one, and if I did hit one, I never noticed it. You start out with three lives but it's pretty easy to grab flies and have at least 5 lives by the time you hit the last stage of the area. Unlock all the characters and you become the Frogger Launch champion with the game congratulating you then asking you to do it again. Yeah, no thanks.   Each frog area is bright and colorful. The characters, enemies and obstacles are animated very well and the backgrounds are very vibrant. The downside is every area looks the same but with a different color palette. The music was rather annoying so I made sure to turn it off. Controlling your frog was iffy at times. If you stick with the pressing up approach right after you bounce off a pad, you won't get as high and could easily land right back down into an enemy. You have to come up with a good combination of pressing up, just leaving the controls alone, or praying gravity and luck clear the stage for you.Frogger Launch was a noble attempt but the mechanics needed some tweaking. A bigger variety of areas and a more user-friendly progress bar would have made the game one of skill instead one of luck. But if youre living life as a frog, and your job is to cross the street without getting smooshed by a car or launching yourself across a swamp with getting eaten by an alligator, then luck is going to always be a factor in your survival.", "date": "Dec 13, 2007"}
