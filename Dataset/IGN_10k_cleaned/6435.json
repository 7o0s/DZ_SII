If you like the game, you can usually have fun with any iteration of it, from the freebie included with every copy of Windows to the uncountable number of versions on mobile. Gameloft enters the crowded arena with Platinum Solitaire, and while it is admittedly difficult to screw up the well-established game, there's no way around the general excellence of this edition.   What sets Platinum Solitaire apart from its competitors immediately is the inclusion of four varieties of the game, including Pyramid and FreeCell. Bang, right there you can eliminate the need to download two additional games. Also slick: The addition of a Casino mode, which gives the game some longevity beyond just tuning in every once in a while to burn a few suits. Not everybody will be into this single-player ~campaign,~ but it certainly adds additional value to a game that already has four times that of a normal solitaire release.   In Casino mode, you can visit four themed joints -- Sphinx Hall, Venezia, Le Grade Folie, and Paradise Island. Naturally, each casino has it's own look and feel to it, such as the backdrop for the action and the dealer. In the casino, you place bets on your talents at clearing decks. While a lot of players will get in there and noodle around, let it be said that after a few ~hands,~ this mode can get wickedly hard. To earn big cash, you have to place high bets, and the higher you bet, the greater the challenge Platinum Solitaire unloads on you.  Platinum Solitaire oozes value. Not only does it include four different types of solitaire, but it also features a single-player mode that dangles a carrot to keep coming back to it. Tracking progress through the accumulation of wealth? Is there any greater goal to a human than that? If you like solitaire, Platinum Solitaire is an excellent value and I recommend you download it, toot sweet.", "date": "Nov 29, 2005"}
