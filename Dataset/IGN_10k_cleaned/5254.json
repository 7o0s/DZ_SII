Legions of fans follow the sport, millions of people worship its athletes and, maybe more than anything else, its energy and charisma. And as Acclaim could attest to with the sales of WWF: Warzone, wrestling sells -- in any shape, way or form.  THQ sparked Nintendo 64's wrestling genre last year with the arrival of WCW/NWO: World Tour, a 3D polygonal adaptation of the over-the-top sport. The game, complete with a commendable cast of wrestlers and a well-liked ~grappling~ system, was an overwhelming success. And now, the company is back with an enhanced sequel that features more wrestlers, more rings, more options, better graphics and more style than ever before. Welcome to WCW/NWO: Revenge.  The Facts  128 Megabit (16MB) cart. By comparison, last year's game was 96 Megabit (12MB).  EEPROM backup(no memory pak required). More than 60 wrestlers, including 50 WCW/NWO superstars. Official wrestling arenas and pay-per-view events. Up-to-date roster (August '98). Stat tracking. Arcade-style scores at end of match. Championship mode with different WCW belts. Enhanced wrestler entrances. More than 700 frames of animation per wrestler. More hidden weapons.  Instant replay feature. Improved AI, speed and animations. New face texture maps. Costume edit mode: Change your favorite wrestler's costume (switch costumes, adjust colors. Multiple types of facepaint also available for certain wrestlers). Improved crowd graphics, including fans with signs and face paint. All the real WCW belts. 40-man Battle Royal (consecutive or random). Combo moves. Voice and likeness of referee Mark Curtis. Rumble Pak compatible. Four-player support.   Gameplay Revenge is running on an enhanced version of the World Tour engine, though one may know realize it at first glance. Asmik and THQ have added quite a few additions, both in terms of visuals and gameplay options. Remember all the wrestlers the original featured? That's nothing compared to what Revenge dishes up. Just some of the game's unmatched character lineup include:  Hollywood Hogan, Stevie Ray, Kidman, Kanyon, Bret Hart, Giant, Bryan Adams, Scott Hall, Scott Norton, Eric Bischoff, Kevin Nash, Sting, Lex Luger Buff Bagwell, Macho Man Randy Savage, Konnan, Raven, Saturn, Lodi, Riggs, Sick Boy, Reese, Roddy Piper, Diamon Dallas Page, Goldberg, Chris Benoit, Rick Steiner, Fit Finley, Disco, Inferno, Jim Neidhart, British Bulldog, Glacier, Meng, Van Hammer, Yugi Nagata, Larry Zbysko, Barbarian, Laparka, Chris Jericho, Eddy Guerrero, Psychosis, Rey Mysterio Jr, Dean Malenko, Juventud Guerrera, Ultimo Dragon, Chavo Guerrero Jr, Alex Wright, Aki Man, Shogun, Executioner, Dr. Frank, Jekel, Maya Inca Boy, Hawk Hana, Kim Chee Dake Ken, Brickowski, Ming Chee, Han Zo Mon, Scott Steiner, Curt Hennig and Booker T.  And that's not all. There are also a few hidden goodies awaiting wrestling fans. Unfortunately, The Ultimate Warrior is not featured in the game. THQ says that it simply didn't have the time to incorporate him for release. Maybe for the next one, huh? Even so, that's one hell of a selection, especially when taking the game's costume-edit mode into consideration, which adds all the more variety. However, you cannot create your own character, like in Warzone, but with a lineup this huge, that's not a big loss.  As you might have guessed, Revenge plays remarkably similar to World Tour. The series' trademark grappling system (which players either love or hate) returns for one more go-around. The mechanics of the system enables faster moves and counters than WWF: Warzone, which keeps the action intense, easy, and addictive. In addition, Asmik has done an excellent job of capturing the speed and style of professional wrestling. Players can now sprint up and slide into or out of a ring, battle outside the ropes, or inside with weapons. Run-ins from opposing wrestlers are common, as are accompanying managers (who can be fought), where appropriate, and more. More than any other wresting game on the market, Revenge feels, moves and plays like the real thing.    It must be said, however, that THQ's title doesn't offer the variety of moves that Acclaim's title does. And, though there are a few new maneuvers possible, Revenge recycles much of World Tour's -- albeit excellent -- animations. Collision detection is also much better. You can tell THQ worked on making wild punches work better when facing two or more opponents, but there are still instances where you fail to hit someone who is standing right next to you, just because the ~focus~ is on the other player. Unfortunately, one of the major annoyances from the original has returned in the sequel. You can break most pins by tapping the analog stick, which screws up the multiplayer game for some. Here's a tip: make an agreement with your friends not to do this trick.  Revenge serves up a Championship mode, divided into US Heavyweight, Cruiserweight, Tag Team title, World Heavyweight, and TV Title (hidden: win Cruiserweight title). Brawls take place in fully-licensed pay-per-view arenas like Monday Nitro, Souled Out, Super Brawl, Bash at the Beach, Halloween Havoc and Starrcade. If you don't want to enter a Championship, Exhibition offers a quick Single Match or Tag Match, or you can try your luck at the 40-man Battle or Handicap Match. The difficulties have also been tweaked. If you're kicking butt on easy, try the same thing on Hard and watch the tides turn rather quickly.  Weapons mode has been significantly expanded, with more brutal objects than ever before. That means beating opponents senseless with an arsenal that consists of briefcases, stop signs, trashcans, chains, pipes, chairs, bats and more. All of which, we might add, can be found in the audience scarily enough. As in the original, Realism Mode provides the necessary blood -- and this time the cart will save it on the ~on~ position, so you won't have to always switch it manually.  And though it's a given, Revenge's four-player mode is just as addictive as last year's game, if not more. Be warned: once you start, you may not be able to put the controller down for quite some time.   Costume Mode Revenge features a well-designed costume mode that enables players the option of alterating the colors of preset suits and face-masks. Not nearly as brilliant as Warzone's create-a-wrestler feature, but a nice addition all the same. So if Sting decides to change his face mask again, you can make the necessary adjustments without problems.  Graphics Good and bad. Asmik has definitely made some notable exterior improvements with Revenge, but the series' 3D engine is beginning to show its age all the same. OK, first the good: new texture maps for just about everything. Wrestlers look less cartoony and more realistic. The crowd looks great and actually animates. Matches are brimming with cinematic intros that highlight wrestler entrances (smoke, pyrotechnics and all), instant replays that show off brutal blows and even subtle changes to fatigued athletes with more blood than ever before. But, and this is a big but, it has never been more evident that Asmik is not using soft-skinning, especially in the wake of WWF: Warzone. Wrestler seams are in abundance, as is clipping. Also, although it's very smooth and beats Warzone's in many respects, the animation could use a bit of work to make the players look less stiff. In the end though, the game looks pretty darn good. In fact, it's rather on the pretty side, but it's certainly not as clean as the competition's admittedly less colorful product. We think it's time to update that engine, Asmik.  Sound Doesn't feature any individual wrestler theme music, which is forgivable given there are so many wrestlers. The generic theme music is pretty good though, the sound effects are cool, and the crowd sounds distinct and clear, but that's really about it. There is no commentary, which is a wrestling must nowadays, and the game completely lacks any speech samples from the stars. Could have been better. I like WCW/NWO: Revenge a lot. It's a much more complete ~update~ to the original. In all honesty, it feels more like an upgrade patch to World Tour than it does a completely new game. That's because the gameplay mechanics remain nearly identical, whereas most of the enhancements lie in graphics and options departments. That's not necessarily a bad thing. My suggestion: if you own World Tour then sell it. Take the money you get for it and put it towards Revenge. It's a much more complete game with tons of style and ambience. Once again, the four-player mode is addictive and reason enough to buy the game, especially if you're a big wrestling fan. However, the game has its faults. Dated graphic seams, and little improvements in the way of moves or animation. Also, don't expect much in terms of music or commentary. But, all things considered, Revenge's strengths definitely outweigh its weaknesses. A great update to last year's version, but THQ would be wise to use a new engine for its next wrestling undertaking.", "date": "Oct 27, 1998"}
