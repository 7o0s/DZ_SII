Picking out a pony's lunch, and brushing his coat, and even cleaning out his stable stall are all pretty tough activities to get incorrect, when adapted into video game form. But, up to now, no DS developer has managed to make actually riding a virtual horse into an intuitive, engrossing gameplay experience. No prior title has managed to make it as fun, addicting, and appropriate to the functionality of the system's touch screen as it should be. Well, Horse Life does.    At long last, this game's translation of riding a mighty thoroughbred through cross-country events, dressage competitions and steeplechases gets it right  with an interface and implementation that are much more fun and addictive than you'd expect, going in. This effort may not have the wealth of customization options and depth of basic care activities as its competing games in the DS virtual pet genre's sub-category of horse sims, but its gameplay takes a clear first place.    You begin your new life with horses at the beginning of one new horse's life, witnessing the first steps  on wobbly legs  taken by a newborn foal. You're offered the choice to choose the young colt's breed, color, stockings and name, after which time time fast-forwards through two full years, and you find yourself back on the ranch with a now three-year-old horse, ready to be trained.    These early moments in Horse Life display both one of the game's drawbacks and one of its great strengths. The drawback being the relative lack of choices in breed and color when first selecting your horse (Pony Friends, for example, is much more thorough and offers a much wider variety of options), and the strength being Horse Life's far superior graphics and animation. In seeing the new pony struggle to its feet for the first time in its life, any player who's also witnessed the 3D models and animation employed in other DS horse games will have to immediately admit they've been bettered here. Horse Life's horses look great.   Whether in competition or just out on the trail, riding your horse is controlled with simple but engaging stylus motions.  You'll get an even better look soon after, too, as your in-game grandfather directs you to begin training with your horse right away. The grandpa directs you to do a lot of things, actually, which ends up working well  though the dialogue gets repetitive pretty quickly, for both him and other non-player characters, it keeps the game structured and flowing well. The training, which Grandpa also hosts, shows off the animation even more  and introduces you to the game's slick, simple and impressive gameplay interface.   Arrows and circles. That's pretty much it. Horse Life's horse-riding gameplay is built on a foundation of arrows and circles, as you tap, touch and drag along them to complete the wealth of different riding maneuvers that you and your horse ultimately learn to achieve. It sounds overly simple to start, and it is early on  completing a simple turn to the left or right is accomplished by tracing a single arrow's progress along the screen, while jumping a low obstacle takes just one tap on a circle followed by another small arrow.    But things get more complicated quickly, as a fully-realized, engaging game structure is built up on that basic foundation  soon enough, you'll find yourself tapping the horse's haunches to increase his gait from a walk to a trot to an all-out gallop, tapping eight circles in sequence to spin him around in a circle, tracing an almost-too-fast-to-handle arrow in a figure-eight pattern to get him replicating your moves with the stylus into moves with his hooves on the ground ... and having fun all the while. The individual techniques seem simple, it's true. But in stringing them all together, fluidly, and making sure each one feels unique, the developers behind Horse Life have created a horse-riding gameplay system that is just a lot of fun to play.   Almost like Elite Beat Agents, in a way, as that game could also be described in a way that oversimplifies what it feels like to actually play it.    Horse Life offers a fair variety of ways to experience that gameplay interface, too, with its variety of different competition events, along with its more open-ended free trail riding. Dressage competitions call on the full range of abilities your horse has learned. Trail riding in the forest is pretty much just all turns and small jumps. Cross-country and steeplechase fall somewhere in-between, altogether creating a good balance of play.   And outside the training and competition aspects of the game, you'll of course get to take care of your horse by feeding it, brushing its coat, cleaning out its stall and all the rest. And you'll get to buy new equipment at the gear shop, win money and acclaim, earn diplomas that certify your skill, et cetera. But these activities are all secondary to Horse Life's spot-on riding gameplay, and horse lovers will want to check out this effort based just on that aspect alone.Eidos Interactive's Pony Friends, which came to the DS earlier this year, still holds down the crown for the greatest depth and variety in creating your own virtual horse, and customizing its look and accessories. But while Horse Life doesn't win against it in that race, it crosses the finish line wait out in front when it comes to actual gameplay. The simple foundation of tracing arrows and tapping circles implemented here to translate training and riding your champion thoroughbred is engaging, and hard to put down. It's a great use of the touch screen, and it will certainly entertain horse lovers for hours. At last, a horse-owning sim that gets the gameplay right. Let's hope it's not the last time.", "date": "Nov 30, 2007"}
