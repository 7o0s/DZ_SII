There's only so many times you can empty the heavens of alien ships or slice up evil warriors before you yearn for something a little more cerebral. Something that works the muscle between your ears. Something like Mobliss' mobile take on the venerable word game, Jumble.   Features:   High score board  Download new puzzles   Jumble has actually been available for several months, and during this time, it has gained a freakishly rabid following. Mobliss' version of the game is multiplayer -- you are scored on quickness of completion -- and its incredible cult following devotes thousands of hours to gaining the top spots on the game's leaderboards.   Download the game for yourself and you'll get an idea why the game inspires such feverish followings. You're presented with a series of nonsense groupings of letters -- but each can be un-scrambled to form a word. There are no un-solvable puzzles. Fortunately, you are given little clues to help finish off a puzzle when you get stuck.   Each day, players download a new puzzle, and it's a rush to see if you can nail it down and make it on the leaderboard. Let's just say this now: You won't. Not unless you have the bizarro dedication of a small cabal of Jumble-heads.    Jumble looks decent enough. The text is clean and clear, and that's all you can ask for from a word game.If you are any sort of word-game junkie, like me, you will get a solid charge out of Jumble. Do yourself a favor, though, and detach yourself from any hopes of seeing your login name on the big board. Once you're free of this pipe dream, you can enjoy Jumble on a daily basis as an affirmation that you know your words.", "date": "May 19, 2004"}
