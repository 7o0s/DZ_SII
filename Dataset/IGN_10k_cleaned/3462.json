Most of the cars you'll race against are the fastest and finest from Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, Lotus etc., but the car you'll be handling in the game's career mode is an original design by your own self-made car company. And it's more than able to take all kinds of nasty dents and scrapes that those other fancy rides can't.   Of course, the premise behind Apex is more than this. Apparently in Europe the automotive industry is such that automakers' performance in various races around the world directly compels consumers to hold those automakers in high esteem and save up the money to buy their vehicles. Apex takes this concept and puts you in the role of automaker with the future of your company hinging on your success as a driver on the racing circuit. This premise ends up reading better than it plays since the game still requires you to win and win often, the only difference is that in addition to unlocking bonus licensed cars, you're also unlocking the elements you'll need to build and improve your company's lineup of original vehicles.  Gameplay  The racing in Apex feels tight and responsive and on par with most other high quality racing titles. It blurs that line between sim and arcade racer the same way Project Gotham because it's very easy to pickup and play, but mastery requires a little more effort. The learning curve for the game is fairly flat. If you like racing games there's nothing here that you haven't seen or done before. The anti-lock brakes on every car give it an arcadey feel since you'll be braking and turning at the same time quite often. The point is, it's consistent so you can learn the way Apex races and have plenty of success once you get it down.   The A.I. of the opposing drivers is an example of an eternal debate about realism versus fun that gamers and developers have wrestled with for years. The enemy cars will slow down and stay within your line of sight when you fall behind as long as you're at least trying to drive competitively. Should you take the lead in a race, they'll always be looming large in your rearview mirror waiting for your slightest mistake before they strike. And by slight mistake we mean letting a tire slip off the track for a split second or brushing up against a guard rail midway through a turn. Surely, in real life these things would slow your race car, but it's also true that your opponents in this real life race would always be going for the kill and would have no problem permanently leaving you in their dust. So as we said the enemies will be on your tail, strike when you make a mistake, but then they'll never open up their lead once they overtake you. It certainly keeps every race interesting and competitive, and you won't feel compelled to restart a race over and over again, but it also just as certainly doesn't feel like the real thing. In the end it's better to have a race continue to mean something rather than feeling doomed because you made a mistake early on. Fun 1, Realism 0.  The total number of cars and tracks in Apex is impressive enough that you'll get plenty of hours out of the game. We haven't counted them ourselves but Infogrames claims there are more than 80 cars to be found in the game. We do know that they're spread across the Dream Car, Roadster, Super Car and Sports Car categories and that final figure may include multiple versions of the same car where once has turbo and the other doesn't.  The multi-national tracks are a joy to behold and even if the direction of the tracks themselves are repeated at least the surrounding environments are kept fresh with urban, country and stadium motifs.   The Dream Mode serves as the game's career mode where you're both CEO and marquee driver of your new car company. The interface is similar to what we're going to see in Pro Race Driver with a fancy menu system that looks like a garage/work area with different characters milling about and shelves and billboards that can be used to manage the game.   You're given a rundown old garage with a overly enthusiastic mechanic to boot. You pick the initial car you want your company to build and select a name and original logo for it. After that it's time to start making a name for yourself. There are 39 championships you can run through in Apex and most are made up of four races. All pro and semi-pro (37 out of the 39) championship races will earn budget points for your company depending on where you finish in the race. With only six competitors in each race, placing fourth or better isn't very difficult and you'll get at least a few budget points. The budget points accumulate until you reach a certain amount where you'll have the option to either spend them right then and there on a new car design or you can keep your cash and continue racing for the big points still out there waiting for you. Either way you'll have to keep racing and either way you'll be on your way towards earning enough budget points to commission new car designs and begin producing them. Nothing leads to more success like success and as you continue racing and winning you'll eventually get a bigger facility, more cars and more staff.   The whole automotive empire building system feels a little hollow because you're not really designing specific details of your product line, you're merely commissioning new pre-determined models and features to be built. You're regularly unlocking licensed vehicles simply by competing in more and more races, but the budget point system is merely a way to unlock unlicensed concept cars that come under the guise of ~new cars~ your company is building. We really like the direction Apex is heading in but an extra layer or two of customization is really what we need to feel like we're actually making a difference in this fantasy world of auto executive/driver.  Graphics  The lighting in Apex is superb. It's not quite the Splinter Cell of racing games but the developers did put a lot of effort into the way lighting changes and behaves on a race course. The cars and race tracks work hand in hand to give Apex a striking presence on your television.  The cars themselves are made up of polygons that rival what you might fine in a Codemasters racing title. You'll appreciate this the most when you check out the smooth shiny rounded fenders of some of the unlockable dream cars in the game. The environments reflect off of the shiny surfaces with remarkable clarity even when you switch to a cockpit view where the hood is nice and close to you. And it's not just a texture that mimics the surrounding environment either, the building you see zooming by on the left will show up on your vehicle a split second later on the correct side in the correct proportions.   As we said, the original cars in Apex take damage but that modification to the car model isn't all it could be. Front and rear bumpers will crumple a bit and you might even get a piece of dragging metal kicking up sparks, but the flailing pieces of debris and twisted metal of Pro Race Driver have already shown us what kind of damage can be done on the Xbox. The damage system is slightly disappointing considering how great the rest of the game looks.   The racing locations are extremely crisp and full of more life than most race tracks. When you're blazing through Manhattan you'll see the flashing lights and hear the sirens of police cars bordering the race track. Sure the police cars themselves aren't very well done themselves but they're there. Imagine the detail and sharpness of the structures, people and objects we saw on the sidelines in Rallisport Challenge and that's pretty much what we're getting in Apex. The difference of course is that you're getting an Entire European countryside or downtown area rendered for you. Very nice indeed.  We're convinced that Apex uses the same track layout, or at least different track pieces, in multiple courses throughout the game. And we mean the asphalt you're racing on, not the whole environment around the track. There are a handful of turns that have the same angle, the same grades but unique surroundings like trees, in one example, or a European village in another. This isn't so much a criticism as an indication of how much emphasis the developers put on fresh race tracks in the game.   Sound  The sound effects are in 5.1 surround sound, but they're so inadequate that you don't want to hear crap like that so clearly. Remember how we said that the enemy drivers in the game are rarely out of your line of sight? The audio result of this is the sound of a pack of cars revving their engines behind you to catch up, but the effect is to muddied to be convincing. When you switch camera angles from cockpit to chase to nose to 3/4 rear you don't get the necessary change in sound perspective that should be there.  Crash sound effects are bland and leave you wanting a lot more. An impartial observer at IGN remarked, upon witnessing a nose-to-tail crash that it ~sounded like a wrench hitting a pipe.~ Wrenches and pipes are worthwhile sound effects but don't get the job done when you're talking about powerful racing machines crashing into each other.  The built-in soundtracks are forgettable euro-techno (as if there needs to be a distinction between different types of techno), but thankfully customized soundtracks are available in Apex and will take you away from all of that headache music.   The voice acting of the characters is surprisingly well done and effective. You're given subtitles just in case, but the game wouldn't be cool at all without the characters actually speaking to you. And the fact that the American voice actor still delivers lines of dialogue that are full of British-isms (nobody on this side of the Atlantic ever says ~straight away~ unless their giving directions) won't be held against the developers either. My biggest problem with Apex is that there isn't anything this racing game does that hasn't been done better somewhere else. Once I got over the fact that it's main gimmick (the auto empire building) didn't add any emotion to the races, I was left with a very basic, competent but still basic, racing title. The development community seems to have an infinite amount of enthusiasm for the racing genre even if they've long since run out of effective gimmicks to make individual games stand out. I would recommend Apex for the absolute diehard racing fan who's already had enough of Sega GT 2002 but who can't wait for Pro Race Driver or Project Gotham Racing 2 and needs something to drive in the meantime. Otherwise, casual fans would be better served sticking with the the established racing franchises.", "date": "Feb 28, 2003"}
