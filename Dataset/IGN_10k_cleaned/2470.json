And because the company's goal is to make games that sell well, it's constantly trying to broaden its reach, drum up with new ideas, and market them appropriately. As with any company, the problem always comes in the execution, and with the exception of the High Heat series, which has generally stayed above the fray, the execution in 3DO's games is lacking. Jonny Moseley Mad Trix is a perfect example.   It's a skiing game, which nobody has approached yet, and in the extreme sports arena, that's a plus. Everything you do, essentially, is based on some cool skiing trick that simply hasn't been breached in games. Cool, right? It's got an arcade feel to it, so anybody can get to grips with the controls, mostly, and pull off some tricks. It's got a great soundtrack, which enhances the skiing fun,too. It's got the master skiing dude, Jonny Moseley, who is Mr. frickin' ski miester right now.   But throughout the game, no matter what level you're on, the experience falters big-time. It's no fun to play. The camera is all screwed up, the levels are wide open and dull as spit. The response is wonky and slow. The game feels loosely tested, and the whole experience is the opposite of extreme, it's sloooooooow as molasses. It's the perfect example of why this 3DO game, and most 3DO games, isn't worth buying.   Gameplay It's hard for me to say these things. I know and like the people who work on 3DO's games, and I want to like this game, because I am convinced that if the proper resources and time were put into it, the series eventually could amount to something. But, as with nearly every other 3DO game I have played, the end result is miserable, and it's something I would not recommend, even to avid skiers.   Jonny Moseley Mad Trix is an extreme skiing game that features the Olympic Gold Medal winner in Freestyle Moguls Jonny Moseley, who you may have seen in recent Sprint TV commercials. But players can get to grips with a slew of other skiers, including Tanner Hall, Evan Raps, Vincent Dorion, A.T. Barron, Miki Iijima, Phat Earl Grogan, Beth ~Wild Child~ Clark, and naturally, the wacky ~Skier X.~   The idea here is to feel like a mad skier, a crazy, extreme skiing fiend who wants to pull off crazy levels of tricks, bust the speed gauge, and earn medals. Players can enter into Freeride, a time-free ride that enables you to simply explore, race, jump, trick, whatever you want, or you can enter into Competition, which offers Ski Camp (training), Slopestyle (competition for gold based on tricks), or Big Mountain, enabling players the ability to speed down the course free of man-made slopes. And if you do it speedily enough, and with big tricks, you will be demoed in a Matchstick Productions ski movie. Yea!   Like I said earlier, the skiing experience in Jonny Moseley may be unique in that it's the only skiing game around, but when it comes to extreme sports, this one is so far behind the others -- Tony Hawk, Dave Mirra, SSX -- that it's jaw-dropping. When I picked it up, I was open minded and tried desperately to find something likeable in it -- as I do with any game, giving it the benefit of the doubt. But after several hours with Mad Trix, I realized that aside from some better than decent motion-capture work (which by the way occasionally got in the way of the tricks themselves) and a cool soundtrack, there was pretty much nothing to like.   First off, the trick system is pretty familiar, based on much of Tony Hawk's initial layout, and so it's easy to begin. It unfortunately goes downhill from there, so to speak. The trick list is short and repetitive, and after two hours, you've essentially tapped out the game's list.   There are huge items laid out across the slopes to multiply your tricks (Blue and Red multipliers for extra points), but why would you really need these? If the tricks were fun to pull off in he first place, then I would spend days in a half-pipe or on some slope driving to pull off more. Instead, these multipliers just seem like cheap incentives to get me to pull them off in designated areas. The point is that the whole damn slope should be an incentive. It should be designed so well that I could find killer spots to return to again and again.   Which brings up another point: Downhill games have an inherent problem in them, it's that players are always going downhill, constantly moving from point A to point B, rather than freely moving about across an environment. Most games, such as SSX Tricky, have been designed to sidestep or even improve upon that rather faulty aspect of skiing or snowboarding games. You recognize that you may have missed something as you speed downhill, but the excitement level and the height of intrigue is so high that you say to yourself, ~Oh damn! I'll have to go back and see what's in there.~ Designing various stories, layers, multiple paths, or a combination thereof creates this experience. And these paths are worth taking, regardless of which one it is, because there is a reward or an item or something that compels you to go there. In Jonny Moseley, regardless of which path you take, it feels like the wrong one. It feels empty. None of the paths in San Francisco, Rome, Machu Pichu, Las Vegas, Washington D.C., Lake Tahoe, Alaska, Nepal, Mt. Kilimanjaro, or Antarctica are stimulating or intriguing or wild rides, or SOMETHING. Here, sadly, you can pretty much spot every single line in the game at first sight, and in games such as Tricky and Tony Hawk 3, it may take you days, or even weeks, to find all them all.   The camera work is generally good, meaning that for most of the time, the camera doesn't get in your way, or intuitively follows the skier, providing the most comfortable position. But that all comes to a crashing halt when skiers enter a bowl or wall area. The camera completely wonks out, confusing the player, and providing the least intuitive angle possible. And not coincidentally, the bowls and giant walls are the areas that provide the most amount of mad trix madness.   I could go on and on, but I won't. The gameplay in Mad Trix is honestly not good no matter how you define good, fun, or extreme, and I had a painful experience every second I played.      Graphics Jonny Moseley is a decent looking game, which moves at an average 30 frames per second. As with all 3DO games, it's brightly lit, colorfully designed, and at least this one is super arcade-y in design, so the Slopestyle levels emote a certain cotton candy, pinball machine-like effect. They're quite creatively designed, at least in look (not in effect), and it was amusing to see what the team did in each wacky new level.   The skiers are motion-captured well, and the so they often move just like real skiers. Having skied most of my life, it's remarkable to see a videogame capture the movement of skiing so well.   Overall, Mad Trix is OK looking, but nothing to write home about.   Sound I don't know much about the current state of the raw/metal/alternative/rap hybrid genres, but I do know that this soundtrack is great fun to listen to.   The list of bands and songs include, respectively, Tribe by The Mad Capsule Markets; Click Click Boom by Saliva; Out With the Old by Alley Life Featuring Black Planet; Chemical by No One; Helium by Seven Channels; Ride by Lyrical Desperados; Inside by Sw1tched; Boomshakalaka by Logan 7; Blinded by Super Human Strength; Contagious by Mission:; Midi Surf by The Mad Capsule Markets; and Get Ghetto by Industry Standard.   The song list, in my humble opinion, is the best thing about game, and if you really like it, 3DO made a separate soundtrack for the game, all by itself.  Well, I kind of feel that I've already said my two cents, and it's not what 3DO wants to hear. I didn't like this game a bit. It's badly designed, weak on tricks, obvious, slow, and light years behind the best, or even the most average extreme sports games. Jonny Moseley is not a game you should buy by any stretch of the imagination. On the off hand that you love skiing so much that you must have this game, I strongly recommend renting it before shelling out any money for it. But still having said that, my first recommendation is to not even look at it. Just walk right on by.", "date": "Feb 7, 2002"}
