The 3D revolution on handsets was a mixed bag of the first degree with a couple games making use of the tech while the other treated polygons as a cheap gimmick. Spider-Man 2 3D: NY Rooftops unfortunately fell into the latter category, but that didn't stop Sony Pictures Digital Mobile from going through with the second chapter of the planned trilogy, Spider-Man 2: NY Subway.   Maybe if you all agree to not download it, we can stop Sony before it kills again.   Spider-Man 2: NY Subway is a bad game. There's just no way around it. The 3D action game spawns five mini-games -- none of which are fun. The game starts out with Spidey sitting on top of a subway car, webbing guns out of the hands of criminals as they speed by on an opposite train. The game simplistic and dull. The next game has you dodging Doc Ock's tentacles on the same train, occasionally splashing him in the face with some webbing. You must watch Spider Sense icons on the bottom of the screen to see where his tentacle will strike next and dodge it by pressing the thumbpad in different directions. Zzz.   The third game is perhaps the worst of them all. You must swing after a runaway car by timing button presses with dot on a meter in the top corner of the screen. There may be some cool 3D action happening on the main part of the screen, but because you cannot look away from the meter, you can't enjoy it. The fourth game has Spider-Man running across the top of a subway car, jumping over and ducking under steel girders. And finally, the fifth game, ~Special Attack,~ is a retread of the number key button masher from the first game that wasn't fun then and sure as hell isn't fun now.   The game features some decent 3D (but not as good as the first game), but refuses to use it in an engaging way. It's 3D because it can be, it does not enhance the game play whatsoever. But, really, what can enhance some un-fun mini-games? Spider-Man 2: NY Subway does VCAST no favors, nor the Spider-Man license.Wowza, this is a bad game. Spider-Man 2: NY Subway should not be downloaded not only to save your gaming dollars for better wares, but to send a message to all developers that D-grade licensed games will not be rewarded. If you want a good Spider-Man experience on your phone, download one of the 2D games released a while back if they are still on the deck. Otherwise, fight the temptation and spend elsewhere. This game is far from heroic.", "date": "Apr 21, 2005"}
