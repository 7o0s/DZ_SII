{"name": "The O.C.", "name_review": "The O.C.", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/08/19/the-oc", "text": "The trend of re-skinning existing games is a disturbing development in mobile. The first memorable re-skin is Glu's Bush Vs. Kerry Boxing, but there have been many other since then, including Indiagames' The Office Games. Add The O.C. to the list, which is essentially a re-skin of Gameloft's very clever New York Nights: Success in the City. The mechanics are nearly identical, such as the need to perform tasks to increase four character stats. It's odd to see such a bastion of creativity like Gameloft pull a re-skin on mobile gamers. True, the firm has used the Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia mechanics for a variety of titles, such as the superlative Mission: Impossible III (the zenith of the engine, so far). But The O.C. is the first time where I found myself thinking about the dreaded word ~lazy~ in connection with a Gameloft game.   Now, there are some differences between The O.C. and New York Nights. The O.C. is more obviously story-driven. At the beginning of the game, you choose one of the four principals of the serial (the game takes place prior to the death of a pivotal character), and then play through a storyline surrounding the lead. The O.C. also includes more mini-games, such as a cooking game for when you seek employ at the local diner and an Asteroids knock-off for when your character plays video games in-game. (In an amusing tweak, your intelligence rating actually goes up when you burn vids in The O.C.)   Fans of the show will likely just want to know if it approximates the source material. Honestly, I'm not a fan of the show, so I wouldn't know if plot lines are hooked into the serial or not. (One story has Ryan trying to repair his reputation after his clothes are found in a stolen car.) But according to IMDB, all of the show's primary characters are in place, like Marissa, Summer, and Seth. During the loading screens between location, the screen fills with snippets of dialogue from the show, many of which are actually quite clever.   When you begin your adventure in Orange County, you have a basic set of stats, such as maturity, intelligence, and style. You must talk to people to improve your standing with them, give gifts to woo a little love from their hearts, as refine your character stats. Each character has favored stats so when you perform activities that boost that stat you get an additional increase. Certain storylines require you hit specific stat levels so a character will ~like you,~ or further the story somehow. Other plot points are achieved by minigames. When you finish the end of a character's story (which doesn't take that long), you can start up with a new character.   Money and time also factor into The O.C. You have a weekly allowance of $40, but you can work at the diner to earn more scratch. You need money to buy clothes at the mall or give presents to friends. The calendar clicks by as you play, and you must achieve certain requirements by specific times, as well as sleep in order to refresh the effectiveness of the different stat-building exercises.   The O.C. skin visuals are pretty solid. The characters all looked like dressed-up sprites from New York Nights. When they talk you see character portraits of the show's actors. The locations are bright, colorful and detailed. Several locations have interactive objects such as a stove, video game consoles, etc. The game is accompanied by several music loops.  If you liked New York Nights, chances are you'd like The O.C. -- since it's built upon the same game. The O.C. is a little more story driven, the dialogue is pretty smart, and there are some new minigames that I think gamers may enjoy, such as the Asteroids. Unfortunately, the game isn't as deep, thanks to truncated character arcs and some simplified game mechanics. I think fans of the show might be amused by this game, but New York Nights is still readily available on most carriers. I recommend you download it instead, or wait for an upcoming Gameloft title that will run circles around both of these.", "date": "Aug 19, 2006"}
