Following their philosophy of always willing to try something new no matter how crazy the idea, who would've thought that a fishing game would've caught on with gamers everywhere?  SEGA's first fishing games sparked the launch of hundreds of different fishing games, but rather than keeping with the arcade nature of SEGA's fishing adventures, other developers opted to make fishing simulators that included every minute detail for the hardcore fishing sportsman.  To this end, gamers had either a choice of simple fishing games that didn't have too much depth or complex fishing simulators that had too many specific details and mechanics, often forgetting about the fun.  Well, with one last cast of the rod, SEGA delivers their final fishing game on the Dreamcast, SEGA Bass Fishing 2 incorporating the easy and fun arcade play mechanics with the fishing sportsman details of water depth, temperature, and free boat movement.  The result is one of the most complete fishing video games that any gamer can get hooked into.  One of the most remarkable features of Bass Fishing 2 is...well, the number of features to customize!  You can opt to fish a full season with all sorts of weather, time, and seasonal effects, or go on a short jaunt with your own environmental situations selected by yourself.  Fishing sportsman should be happy with ability to select the time, the weather, and season they'll be fishing; altering any of these features will have an immediate impact on the number of fish you'll be able to hit, what type of fish will be swimming about in the water, as well as if they'll be deep or shallow water.  Once these settings have been finalized (either by you or the computer), it's time to do some fishing!  SEGA kept the core gameplay mechanic of Bass Fishing 2 relatively the same as its predecessor but added a few new fishing details that will have students of the rod and line prostrated at attention.  In past fishing games, the player had a limited area where he could cast his bait.  That has changed now as you have the ability to cast your bait at different distances and with different casting techniques.  The ability to cast shorter or farther depends on the position of your boat.  In SEGA Bass Fishing 2 you now have full control of where you fish by moving your boat.  Along with the ability to move your boat, you also have a depth scanner that measures the distance between the bottom of the lake and your boat; this will help players to judge good casting areas.  Of course, to make your life a bit more difficult, the fish will often be hanging around pier columns or underneath other fixtures.  Thankfully, you have the ability to cast your bait with a sidearm motion so you'll be able to pop that bait farther into those narrow areas than a normal overhead cast could.  Of course, you'll have all sorts of different baits to try out with different attributes of sinking depth, color, and noise levels.  This time around, the baits are a bit more challenging to work with than in previous versions and the fish are definitely on to you.  It's rare that a fish will bite the same bait twice no matter how much time you wait to cast in the same area.  With all that said and done, the actual fishing mechanic is virtually the same as it ever was.  Toss your bait and reel it in, with the hopeful result that it'll grab the attention of some large-mouthed bass.  Obviously, the SEGA Fishing Rod is the best tool in order to get that great fishing experience and I would almost say it's necessary if you really want to enjoy the game to its fullest.  While it plays fine on a normal Dreamcast pad, the controls aren't quite as fun or intuitive.  Additionally, you'll feel you have more control with your bait - reeling in action while using the fishing rod's analog pad to make the bait ~jump~ - on the fishing rod than the Dreamcast pad.  Nonetheless, the fishing action remains the same; once you set the hook on a fish, the tension meter will appear and believe me, you want to keep that tension down as fishing lines break a bit more frequently than in the previous games.  Fish never look more appealing and realistic, as Sega Bass Fishing 2 offers some of the best-looking visuals for any fishing game - yeah, that not really saying too much because we all know how ~graphically intensive~ fishing games can be.  Still, there are some really nice visual effects especially since time plays a role in the game.  Fish move with nice realism and the jerkiness of motion that you might've seen in past SEGA fishing games is no longer prevalent.  Occasionally, there are a few clipping problems where fish will swim ~into~ certain underwater objects or when your character is handling the fish, his arm will appear ~inside~ the fish, but miniscule flaws like that really don't hamper your overall enjoyment of this title's visuals.  As stated above, there's a good amount of features ranging from fishing the whole year round, as well as the ability to customize your fisherman.  All in all, beyond the small visual flaws you might see, the game can get a bit tough; at one point, I had my line break three times in a row when reeling in a fish because the tension meter filled up right as I set the hook on my fish.  Additionally, I wish you could start off with a better selection of baits, especially since you don't start with many that can sink.  Finally, I'm a bit surprised not to see fishing weights in the game - with slightly more ~sim~ aspects of fishing, I would've thought SEGA would add the well-known technique of applying fishing weights to your line so you could drop the bait deeper into the water.  But all in all, you're not going to find a better fishing game for every type of skill level than Sega Bass Fishing 2, as SEGA once again, knows how to reel in the big ones.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Aug 29, 2001"}
