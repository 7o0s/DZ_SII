That soft spot contained a certain charm and likeability sat in those cartoony bodies. The games might not have been the best strategy series ever, but at least it had its style to set it apart from the crowd. Not only did they change the style of the art, which was a mistake as far as I'm concerned, but also tried to ~Americanize~ the game by making it more combat oriented. Sadly, the combat added does nothing to promote the genre, even going so far as to be reminiscent of so many cookie cutter RTSs that cluttered our lives 3-5 years ago. The Settlers: Heritage of Kings is... bland. That's the word. Bland. I have a feeling I would forget about it immediately after writing the review if the music wasn't scratching through my head like a broken record.   The thing is, Heritage of Kings isn't a horrible game. I don't know that I would even truly call it bad. It's just... well, it's just there with no nutritional value. Take Dario (a name that inspires respect and awe in Medieval Times restaurants everywhere) the main character. He's the son of a king that was whisked away to safety by his mother, the queen, only to find out because of an amulet that he was the ~rightful~ heir to the throne. So far so average, right? Well, along the way, he meets up with old friends that join forces with him. A mountain ranging dwarf that blows things up, a soldier friend from home that can whoop armies all by his lonesome, a misunderstood thief girl, a wise old uncle... you get the picture. They'll help him take back his country one territory at a time, gathering folks grateful for his help and leadership, some of whom will actually hand their towns over to him.   But the story is told with so little detail, character, or panache that I just don't care. I don't know who Dario is. He doesn't seem to have a personality at all. All the other heroes act pretty much the same. They have different voices and accents, but they're all just as mysteriously boring. Not even their special abilities are special looking. It's almost easy to forget to use them (and hard to know they've been used in some cases) because there's no visual reward. For a game that lasts so bloody long, you would figure that these characters would have had the chance to develop some sort of individuality. They just kind of get lost in the midst of the game and environment (sometimes literally). Having lost the art style and personality of the cartoony charm, story and character should have been a bigger issue.     The strange thing is, the graphic quality of the art is actually very good from a technical standpoint. Animations are very decent, especially with the moving parts on the buildings (the cannon factory is my personal favorite), and add a good level of detail. All of the textures, whether they're on the buildings or character models are technically lovely as is the world in general. You can tell that these guys are proud of their achievement, especially the waterfalls, as there are a couple of moments in the game where they literally say ~Hey, stop and check out the waterfall, it's beautiful.~ The problem isn't the quality of detail or execution, but little missing details and the generic nature of the art. Details like real-time lighting and shadows can make art like this sing, even without style, but it was missing. So instead we're left with art that looks like a crisper version of art we've seen a thousand times before.   Same goes with sound. There's some good, if repetitive, music to listen to and some good ambient sounds, but the voice-overs are so boringly lifeless that it's really hard to give a crap about what anyone is saying. They're trying to be fun, but just plain aren't. Unit acknowledgements are my real problem. While they sometimes say some clever things when you click to much or select them, all of the military units have the same voice work. The sword men sound the same as the spearmen who sound the same as the archers who sound the same as the cannons.   The gameplay that's supposed to outshine both the story and the visuals doesn't exactly help either. The Settlers series has never been known for a ton of action packed moments or even particularly good gameplay and in this respect Heritage of Kings stays true to its roots. Yes, the game is a lot about economic build up and challenge, but it takes for freaking ever to get a really viable base going in the single player campaign. Resources trickle in as you try to build an army, research, and build up a town. It's a challenge to juggle the resources and decide what part of the town or army is most important, but there's not usually a huge sense of urgency about any of it. Occasionally there will be something that requires you to perform a task in a certain amount of time, such as using a weather machine to thaw out a lake, but those moments are few, far between, and don't really inspire a sense of need that they should.    Level design is similarly disappointing. Again, there are the exceptions, but the basic point of every map is to build up a town by first finding resources, then constructing beginning structures like housing and farms around the resources, building a college for research purposes so you can construct other buildings, and so on. Yes, there are different objectives. One mission will have you harvest enough resources to help a town while another will have you wander the map trying to find a chest in a swamp. But the basics are always the same. This game is back to late 90's as far as mission design goes. Put some creativity into it guys. Provide some meaningful challenges as far as town planning or resource harvesting goes. It's the same fricking thing every time, which is the same fricking thing as Settlers IV. So much for change.   And then there's the pace. The pace just never picks up. Heritage of Kings doesn't get anymore exciting as you go along. The difficulty level increases thanks to some enemy bases that are well defended (and an army that's terribly hard to control) but strategic challenges seem to have been pushed to the side in favor of... in favor of... I don't know what they pushed it aside for, because there's not really anything there.   They say that combat has been redesigned to be more meaningful, and yes, it's more important because enemies attack you and you have to attack enemies, but combat control and depth seems to have also been taken from one of the cookie cutter games of the late 90's early 00's. It's rock, paper, scissors type stuff, but armies are so hard to select and control once battle is joined that it's basically left up to who has the most upgraded soldiers in order to win. You can tip the balance of the battle in your favor with some hero abilities for buffing defense and offense, but when coming up against heavily fortified locations, you just have to hope for the best. Even cannons designed specifically for knocking down buildings don't really do a decent job of it. Their range isn't good enough to stay out of range of towers and they don't do a particularly good job taking them out anyway. It's actually quicker to send in upgraded spearmen or swordsmen to take down towers, which not only makes no sense, but also sends them into huge danger from other towers located in convenient direction. Every RTS game I know has a counter for base defense. Settlers is wholesale slaughter if there is significant defense with towers and men backing them up.     On top of all of this, there were some simple mistakes and problems that seem to have been sadly overlooked. For instance... why are there no scouts? Why isn't there an automatic explore button like there is in any other resource heavy game like this one? Why are enemy health bars so freaking hard to see? Why isn't there better organization for troops? Why does double clicking on a unit only sometimes work to select multiple units of the same type in the area? Why can't I queue up research, building construction, or military units? Why can't I set a rally point for military buildings? Why are saved games sorted by alphabetical order instead of most recent saves? These are all simple things! Simple things that have been in RTSs for years. By themselves they might be overlooked, but there's just so many of them throughout the entire game.   Multiplayer features three different types of play to go along with all of the problems. Thankfully, because a couple of these types of play actually focus on research progress, those that like to build cities will actually have a planning battle with one of their friends that will last a couple of hours (unless you play the time limit version). It's almost better not to have to worry about the crap that comes along with the single player campaign. The challenge will be in a human opponent instead of working your way through a sadly designed mission or campaign.I miss the big headed people. They added charm to a game that was otherwise without much charm. Without those big headed cartoon people, The Settlers series is just another RTS that manages to scrape by on technical graphics and decent sound. The gameplay, which I had believed would be changing fairly significantly, hasn't really changed a bit. Armies are organized a tad bit differently, but combat is still elementary school strategy for dummies. The pace of the game is still frustratingly slow (even if they did rid themselves of horrible pathfinding problems) and missions aren't anything close to exciting, even when they're supposed to be.This is simply a below average game that I can't really find much of a reason to recommend. There are plenty of strategy games out there that have both military and economic challenges that are much more fun and rewarding than this.
