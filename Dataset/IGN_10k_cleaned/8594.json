That's likely because, aside form the most furtive corners of department stores, it doesn't exist. We'll assume it hasn't gained more widespread appeal because it's repetitive, boring, and pointless, which accurately describes the experience of playing through Made Man. You'll be doing quite a bit of mannequin-blasting in this game, since the AI routines for the enemies are about as complex as a cup of dirt.   You play as Joey Verola, a Vietnam veteran climbing the hypothetical ladder of the New York mob. It's a third-person action game split into stages based on flashbacks from Joey's life. In the present, Joey's driving in a car, telling mob and war stories and when he launches into each you have to shoot your way through it. In this sense, the game actually has an interesting narrative vehicle, although the story itself isn't particularly gripping. If only the shooting was remotely interesting.    Most of Joey's enemies, from country folk with shotguns to mob soldiers to FBI agents, all suffer from extreme lethargy. They're more than content to simply stand still, firing their weapons until the clip runs out, then reloading, and then resuming the exact same action. Joey is able to put his back to walls and fire around corners to stay out of harm's way, but this is hardly necessary given the opposition's pathetic level of intelligence.   Once in a while you'll see an enemy do something which indicates they have a slight sense of self-preservation. They'll duck behind cover, occasionally, but then ruin their chances of living by standing up to shoot in the exact same spot every time. You can sit there with your cursor sitting over where you saw their head pop up, and they're dead. Other enemies will run directly at you; many try to fire through solid walls, and others run automatically to specific spots, start firing, and never move.   In an action game where all you do is shoot, you need interesting targets. Made Man delivers a shooting experience more akin to hitting immobilized elephants with a sniper rifle from five feet away.   We can't forget to mention all the awkwardly tacked-on combat mechanics in this game. Killing enough people allows for an extreme slow motion mode, allowing you to line up your firing cursor even more accurately, as if that was required. There's also a Retort Kill mode, where, after you shoot down an enemy, you can once in a while hit the circle button to unleash a stylized execution. By that we mean the screen splits in two, Joey spouts an idiotic line of dialogue before shooting the downed opponent in the face.    Made Man is a clear example of how stuffing profanity into dialogue in no way makes it better. Though the voice acting for Joey and some of the main characters isn't the worst around (see Mage Knight: Apocalypse), it's poorly written. The random shouts of grunt NPC enemies are so bad they'll probably make you laugh, maybe even briefly distract you from furiously hitting the power button on your PC. Gun effects are much worse, with shots sounding more like a soda can opening than gunpowder being ignited. Visually, there's practically nothing to hold your attention. With Made Man, you get simple environmental textures, generic character designs, and bad animations.   But hey, Joey can wield dual shotguns. That counts for something, right?   For the PC version, players are treated to a more high-resolution version of an ugly game, though you won't find any widescreen settings. Props have to be given for including mouse support, something neither Capcom or Ubisoft decided to implement for the recently released version of Resident Evil 4.Made Man's combat is as boring as daytime television, and all you do is fight. There's a notable narrative structure to house the flat storyline, but it's nothing to get excited about. Poor graphics, banal sound effects, and frequently absurd voice acting wrap up this bomb of a game in a rotten bow. Avoid at all costs.", "date": "Jun 5, 2007"}
