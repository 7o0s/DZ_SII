All THQ Wireless needed to do to succeed was release a competent port of the famous ostrich-on-vulture violence simulator to please fans, and the firm has done just that. The look and overall feel of the arcade game has made the transition to the smallest screen, however, the controls did need slight adjusting to make up for the change in venue.   Now, instead of jamming on a button to flap your wings, you just press up. This does steal away some finesse, but it was an essential change. It may take a slight adjustment period for purists to hone their drop techniques, which is how you turn vulture-mounted bad guys into point-a-licious eggs.   Joust is a very solid recreation of the arcade game, including the visuals. Things have been slight shrunk, but there is no mistaking the classic. The game still looks like something from a late-70s prog-rock album cover. Many of the sound effects have been included. Overall, this is a good port of a great game -- not deep, but neither was the original. A solid timekiller if there ever was one.", "date": "Feb 12, 2005"}
