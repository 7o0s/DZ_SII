Saturn, PlayStation, NeoGeo Pocket Color, and Game Boy Color...each of these systems has had at least one variation of the Bust-a-Move design, and I've been there to play and/or review each one...and it hasn't been a chore, since the game is a load of fun and darn addictive in whatever form it's been produced in. Ubi Soft is the lucky company with the Bust-a-Move rights for the Game Boy Advance, and the version that's been created for the system is by far the best handheld version of the series. Features Four modes of play Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Advance  In this devious and engaging puzzle game, it's all about hand-eye coordination, quick thinking, and planning ahead. At the bottom, you've got your bubble shooter. At the top, you've got your stack of bubbles. The task is to shoot colored bubbles one at a time at the stack above, connecting three or more of the same line to make those bubbles pop. All this must be done before the stack drops below the line -- right under your bubble shooter. Since bubbles connect to one another, you can drop a whole load of bubbles off your screen by removing the support bubbles that hold them in place.   Every version of Bust-a-Move has its own hook, and Super Bust-a-Move is no different. This version adds a new element to the mix: mini-bubbles. These bubbles are tiny enough to fit into small gaps between bubbles, before expanding to the normal bubble size. Of all the past inclusions that have been added to the original's design, the mini-bubbles actually fit the series the best, since there's not a single Bust-a-Move player out there that hasn't tried to squeeze bubbles into holes that they thought a normal bubble could fit. And though the game throws away additions that were established in previous sequels (like the stupid chain reactions and the semi-cool pulley system of Bust-a-Move 4), Super Bust-a-Move brings back some of the more elaborate elements: rainbow bubbles that turn the same color as the bubbles that have been linked next to it, and star bubbles that pop same-color bubbles when they're thrown into the stack. Of all the variations of Bust-a-Move ever created, the designers have finally created a near-perfect balance of old and new elements. Of course, if you just want to play the standard Bust-a-Move way, Classic Mode is in here so you can play the old-school levels without the power-ups.  Solitaire's a fun way to play Bust-a-Move, but competition is always more hectic...and Super Bust-a-Move has a fantastic Vs. mode that puts the player up against eight of the strangest computer characters around. Our dino heroes Bub and Bob have been reduced to the roles of the creators and distributors of the bubbles...the new creatures take a more prominent role as the players' personas and competitors during the Bust-a-Move battles. Each of these characters has its own ~attack pattern~ for when you drop bubbles out of your stack, so it's best to see what kind of havoc each of these characters can cause to help you on your way to victory. This Vs. mode also supports a second player, but you'll have to grab another system, a link cable, and another copy of the cartridge to take advantage of the two player feature. This game could have seriously benefited from supporting the GBA's barely touched single-cartridge multiplayer mode...the game's program can't be that sizeable, can it? Eh, this would have been an awesome feature for Ubi Soft to utilize, but sometimes you just can't have it all. Super Bust-a-Move on the GBA does require a strong, keen eye during gameplay since the bubbles are a bit on the small side. The graphics are sharp and clean, and definitely the best looking handheld version thanks to the enhanced color palette on the system. But you'll have to train your eyes to immediately tell the difference between certain colors, like orange and yellow for example. The D-pad controls are way too loose to really utilize properly, since they move the pointer a might too quickly for any sort of accuracy. Luckily, the L and R buttons have been mapped for the more precise left and right movements...and I found myself using the shoulder buttons for 99% of the action.  Though players will have their top scores recorded in all the modes in the game, including how each character performed in the Vs. mode, there's no battery in place to save this data. So once the game's shut off, all these records are wiped clean. It's obvious that Altron had planned on a battery, since there's an option to ~Clear Records~ in the game menu. That's a real shame, and it would have added to the game's enjoyment had this information been recorded to cartridge.  Despite the lack of battery save, Super Bust-a-Move is a great puzzle game for the Game Boy Advance. Its classic design returns the game to its roots, but it includes elements that make more sense than additions that were included in the series' sequels. Just train your eyes to recognize certain colors that look a bit too close to other bubble colors, and you'll have a great time with this action puzzler.", "date": "Dec 5, 2001"}
