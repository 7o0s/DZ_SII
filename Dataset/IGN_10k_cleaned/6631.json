The only face of fame for a graf artist in those days was the images they left blazing on cement walls across the cities. As Dream crept into the Oakland train yards night after night, hood pulled low over his face to help obscure his identity, I'm sure he had no idea that one day there'd be a videogame based on his highly controversial art. Nevertheless, here we are in 2006 and we have a videogame by Atari that mimics the lifestyle of the urban graf artist. This isn't Jet Set Radio, but a tribute to one of the four legs of hip-hop -- the urban art of graffiti. This is Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure, a game with great elements, but weak execution. The story revolves around a young urban phenom named Trane. He lives in the oppressive city of New Radius and is ambitious about becoming a star graf artist, but there are a ton of obstacles to contend with. Rival crews and fascist-like police officers called the Civil Conduct Keepers (CCK) are very much interested in destroying young Trane. But he's not going to let any of that get him down. Trane seems used to being disliked. In fact, almost everyone he meets wants to kick his ass, probably because he crosses out others' pieces he sees on the wall. In the real graffiti world, that's enough to get almost anyone beat-up. One of the coolest things this game has going for it is the kick-ass soundtrack! If the same scrutiny given to the soundtrack was applied to the control scheme in the game, Getting Up would've been an extraordinary experience. Just to give you a taste, the game features songs from Talib Kweli, Mobb Deep, Pharoahe Monch, Del The Funky Homosapien, Eric B and Rakim. That's some serious hip-hop talent right there, and it truly adds to the atmosphere of the game. At one point, Trane is riding the roof of a subway and has to tag on it without getting knocked-off. In the background, I hear the beat from Grandmaster Flash and Melle Mels' White Lines. This not only made me want to start breakdancing on the spot, but it made this scene in the game adventurous with hip-hop flavor. Awesome! Another great element is how the designers have incorporated graffiti legends and black books in this game. If you know anything about graffiti, you know that a piece book (or black book here) is a tagging necessity. It's not only what you use to practice your art in, but whenever you run-up on another cool artist, you want them to put something in your book. When Trane first meets the legendary Futura, he makes a request for him to hit-up in his Black Book. It's a moment that made me smile because it reminds me of the first time I met Dream. And just like Dream told me, Futura tells him to ~know his history.~ He explains that every time he sees a legend's piece around the city, he should take a snap-shot of it and put it in his Black Book. Other legends offer up sage advice, like when Cope2 tells Trane to ~stay off the third rail.~ Any real graf artist knows what this means as soon as they hear it. If you're dying to know, play the game, or go rent the movie ~Beat Street.~ In sum, the game takes an opportunity to educate the players on the nuances of graffiti and what the art is all about. One of the more curious elements in this game about art is the combat system. Trane can deliver a host of punch and kick combos, roll maneuvers, blocks and grapples. On top of this, Trane can humiliate enemies by smacking them when they're on the ground, and even go as far as shoving them into pits or throwing them into oncoming traffic. For those of you who've played Devil May Cry 3, and managed to use Dante's Beowulf weapon, some of the techniques used there might look familiar here. By holding the punch or kick button at the end of a combo, then letting go, you can deliver a power move that drains some of your blue-colored skill meter. In brief slow motion, this move flings a walloping punch or kick at the enemy, taking a chunk out of his life bar. When the skill meter runs out, you can no longer pull off power moves, so you have continuously feed the bar by getting your hits in. As for grappling, hitting the punch and kick buttons at the same time will make Trane grab his enemies. At that point you mash the punch and kick buttons as rapidly as possible to gain the advantage, and then Trane is able to deliver the appropriate knee in the face or jaw-dropping elbow to their backs. There are some rather unforgiving problems with the combat system. For one, the mouse buttons don't feel responsive enough, so most of the battles rely on the user simply mashing away at the mouse in hopes of timing a well-placed hit. Everything just ends up feeling rather clumsy and forced. It's a bit more intuitive on the PC when using the mouse, and Trane feels as though he moves a bit faster here than on the consoles. But the overall combat still feels awkward. I know that at its core, this isn't a fighting game. Be that as it may, I still expect the fighting component to feel fluid and accurate. When I'm trying to land a punch in this game, I mash away at the mouse as if I'm trying to force the game to work. The platforming component here gets awkward as well, especially if you are using a mouse and keyboard. For one, some ledges you'd expect Trane to grab are unobtainable to him. You'll jump and jump until you're blue in the face, and all he can do is the same lame slow-motion lunge without making a grab for a ledge that he can obviously reach. Sometimes simply jumping from one platform to another feels just as clumsy as the fighting. The camera isn't as painful of an issue on the PC, because you can whip around and get a good look at everything using the mouse. So navigating is a little friendlier here. If you want to know where the sweet spots for tagging are, you have to activate your Intuition. When you hit the appropriate button, the screen turns yellow, and blue and gold wisp-like vapors streak across the screen. These ghostly entities show you where you're supposed to ~get-up~. You follow the trail as they glide through the air, and they eventually land at an opportune spot for a brilliant piece or throwie (or throw-up, as we say on the west coast). The gold vapors land on gold Xs which are your primary target. The blue vapors show you secondary targets that will get you bonuses. Once you make it over to where the vapors landed, be it a wall or billboard, the initial outline of your tag design will glow white. At this point you can hot key through several styles you have in your black book. As you progress through the game, more and more styles become available to you. You can even make the piece bigger, depending on where your target is. If the piece is too big for a given region, it'll glow red, letting you know that you must shrink it down some, but you do in fact get bonus rep points for make big pieces. When it's time to act, Trane pulls out the right tool for the job. He can tag with an aerosol can, paint roller or glue brush, while some situations call for the simple scribble of a marker. Once you start painting, it's your job to move Trane's arm around and cover the entire surface of the design with the paint. He has to fill in all the spots without lingering too long in certain areas or else he'll get dreaded drips. Getting the piece done in a sufficient time frame gets the user rep points. If you're playing the PC version, this is where the PC controls get a little awkward. Using a mouse and keyboard together to paint can feel cumbersome. Trane has to fill in all the spots without lingering too long in certain areas or else he'll get dreaded drips. It feels a bit more difficult to spray evenly with keys and mouse buttons. Getting the piece done in a sufficient time frame gets the user bonus rep points, although I had tougher time meeting that time requirement using PC controls. Don't assume you can just tag anywhere in New Radius. Although this would be a great feat to be able to paint wherever you want in this world, Trane is limited to the predetermined zones. There were several occasions where I ran up to a wall just for kicks and tried to scribble something with a marker, and all Trane could tell me was ~not here.~ What? What do you mean ~not here~? It's not like this is some complicated, slanted surface in the city -- it's a perfectly flat wall ripe for tagging. Unfortunately, Trane couldn't do it. And this happened more often than I would've expected, which is what made it stand out to me as a flaw. The fact that a graffiti artist (an ambitious one at that) would stop himself from tagging anything just boggles the mind. The hardest thing for me to get used to is the fact that this game has no feature that allows users to design their own tags and put them in the game. On a purely philosophical level, how can someone go about making a game about art without allowing users to be artistic themselves? Sure, you can pick out colors and styles, but that's it. Graffiti is all about personal expression, so it's rather heartbreaking to learn that the one game that was devoted to graffiti won't let you tag what you want. EyeToy for the PS2 would have allowed you to take a snapshot of a drawing so you could throw it in the game. As soon as I heard this game existed, I simply assumed that it would have some kind of functionality that worked that way. I was sadly mistaken. The fact that you can't paint your own personalized tags and pieces around New Radius has a direct impact on how fun the game is. Think about it: How motivated are you going to be to climb some dangerously high platform to tag someone else's name? I struggled with this throughout my experience with Getting Up. I'd use my intuition to spotlight some high, tough area to tag on and suddenly feel myself rolling my eyes in apathy. I just didn't want go through the trouble of getting up there. And this feeling perplexed me for a while until I realized that I had invested nothing in making sure that Trane got his name up there. The reason why real life graffiti artists risk their lives to paint their art in those hard-to-reach spots around the city is that they're very proud of the art that they come up with. They want everyone to see what color combinations and amazing designs they've woven together. Why would any of them go through all that trouble to paint someone else's name and use someone else's style? Sometimes a graf artist might write their friend's name next to theirs if they're going tagging alone, but for the most part, it's a very narcissistic hobby. So the fact that we can't impose our own sense of art in the game becomes an even bigger loss. I appreciate what this game is trying to do. Unfortunately, it can't quite get the fundamental controls to work well enough. I appreciate what this game is trying to do. Unfortunately, it can't quite get the fundamental controls to work well enough. If fighting is in the game, it has to function as well as everything else. The same goes for platforming. And gameplay gets a little messier if you're playing this on PC, where the controls have its pros and cons. The fighting feels a little faster, but the spray painting feels more awkward using a keyboard and mouse. I love the soundtrack, and I love the graffiti cultural nods that show up through the story. But I really wish there was some way to import my own art and paint that all over New Radius. That element alone would have given this game so much more substance. My only wish now is that the team pursues a sequel where the controls are tweaked and user art can be implemented.", "date": "Feb 16, 2006"}
