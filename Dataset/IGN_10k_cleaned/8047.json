Ask any selection of bright-eyed children their plans for a future career, and you're sure to hear ~vet~ mentioned more than just once. It's that audience of young, potential pet doctors that this release, Paws & Claws Pet Vet, is targeting. It's not a virtual pet game, as might be your first guess. It's more of a simulation, placing you in the role of a young woman just starting out with her own veterinary clinic. The experience will be most engaging for those with an existing interest in animal care, and is worth a look from players fitting that description. But Pet Vet isn't going to win any awards for outstanding presentation or depth of design, meaning a majority of Nintendo DS owners won't be missing out by passing it by.    THQ is publishing Paws & Claws through their budget-oriented division ValuSoft. This game's style, though, may remind you more of one of EA's brands, The Sims  Pet Vet could have easily been marketed as SimVet. The only problem with that is that SimVet already exists, in the form of The Sims 2: Pets. That Sims spin-off came to the DS just a few months ago, and was an underwhelming release. It presented a veterinarian simulation, sure enough, but also kept to the strict Sims franchise convention of raising and caring for your human avatar as well. The split design was unfocused and, ultimate, unengaging.    Paws & Claws is more targeted. Here the focus is strictly on the animals, the gameplay's core never straying from the goal of becoming the most successful vet you can be. To begin, your practice is small. A lone, little building sitting out in a field, containing a lone, little waiting room of no population. Customers will come, and do, one at a time, carrying with them their enfeebled, diseased and otherwise unhealthy animal companions. Only birds, rabbits and hamsters appear at first  you're uncertified to care for larger animals at the onset. The dogs, cats and horses come later, after properly completing a set chain of tasks in your veterinary career.    The game's progressive line of goals to achieve is outlined simply and visibly through an in-game menu. You need to treat your first patient, then examine a few different species, then earn enough money to construct additions to your facilities and so on. Paws & Claws does a nice job of keeping things clean and organized, so you never feel frustrated or unsure of what to do. The hand-holding is especially important in the game's animal examination sequences, where your pet patients lay trembling on the treatment table and it's up to you to administer the proper injections, apply the proper ointments and calm the patient with the proper bedside manner.    The last of that list is achieved through the DS microphone, which picks up such spoken phrases as ~Don't worry!~ and ~It's alright!~ and registers a soothing effect on the current examinee. Well, maybe it does. It's hard to tell if the mic feature really even picks up anything at all, as each animal's anxiety meter seems a non-factor in the gameplay anyway. It's hard to tell if Pet Vet uses any of the DS system's unique features, really, as its touch screen elements are similarly scattershot and inconsequentially implemented  you're better off just using the D-Pad and face buttons than trying to figure out when and where a stylus tap might be recognized as input.       That's the lacking feature that will keep the not-quite bright-eyed potential players away. Pet Vet has the faintest markings of a Trauma Center for animals, but stops well short of being immersive and settles into button-tapping tedium. It's fairly intriguing to see the added complexities that come through extended play, like the arrival of more involved medical cases and different kinds of animals. And there's an undercurrent of edutainment running through many of the game's management tasks, in balancing your budget, buying food and medication in town, choosing whether or not to advertise your clinic to attract more customers. But there's little beyond the educational experience. You'll learn a lot from simply reading the disease diagnoses and choosing the right medications to apply, but why not some added gameplay there? Why not some control over the application? If I'm told to wipe a disinfecting cloth over the patchwork skin of a mange-ridden rabbit, I'd like to actually rub the bunny rather than just pressing A. With that kind of potential left uncapitalized on, Paws & Claws Pet Vet won't inspire anything more than a moderate level of interest. As a ValuSoft budget title, Pet Vet's asking price is a bit of a bonus. You should be able to find it in stores with a tag of $19.99. But its no-frills gameplay likely won't prompt any child to re-assess their plans for the future  kids already considering veterinarianism will leave with a better vision of the job, while the rest will continue dreaming of becoming police officers and firefighters without distraction.", "date": "Feb 14, 2007"}
