{"name": "Purge", "name_review": "Purge Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/04/29/purge-review", "text": "In the middle of the last decade, a fledgling development team now known as Freeform Interactive released a total conversion for one of the most acclaimed shooters of the time. Dubbed Future vs. Fantasy, it lent an RPG-like depth to its single-player and online play, which revolved around a conflict between a cabal of fantasy-style combatants and a faction of technology-infused warriors. Likely based on its popularity, the developers subsequently decided to turn the concept into a commercial venture, securing a publishing deal with Tri Synergy and changing the project's moniker to Purge. To furnish the visuals, the studio licensed the Talon iteration of Touchdown Entertainment's middleware technology, using it to render some eight different character models plus 32 types of weapons, and to produce a diverse setting encompassing both indoor and outdoor environments on 15 disparate maps.  As with its thematic forebear, Purge features two diametrically opposed forces, The Order and The Chosen. Within a futuristic setting where mankind is governed by the technology-obsessed combatants who comprise the former, the latter faction, embittered after the assassination of its founder, has emerged to pose a formidable threat. The ensuing conflict takes the form of round-based combat, with each of the two sides endeavoring to destroy the other's portal, a structure through which troop reinforcements may be spawned. As well as the aforementioned variety of armaments, there are 24 different skills - three available to each infantry class - which may be utilized in supportive, offensive or defensive roles.  As Freeform Interactive seems to be going to increasing lengths to point out, Purge is considerably more involved than a run of the mill shooter, something that becomes apparent upon start up. Before you can enter the fray, a choice of your protagonist's alignment, Order or Chosen, has to be made, in addition to which you are required to select from one of four general character classes. Android, Cyborg, Commando and Wastelander comprise The Order's forces, while Mages, Fighters, Assassins and Monks provide the opposition under the banner of The Chosen. As well as selecting which of these character classes to play, there are four further variants per class, which effectively boosts the tally of disparate character types to an impressive 32. Each sub-class is tailored to performing a specific role on the battlefield; for example, in the case of the Android, it has variants known as Infantry, Anti-Armor, Marksman and Engineer, each designation being fairly self-explanatory as to the area of specialization. In addition to this, there are seven characteristics - including Dexterity, Agility and Strength - that have a major bearing on how your character performs on the battlefield. A character with good Dexterity, for instance, will be an accurate shot, while one with decent Strength can carry more ammunition.  The online-only conflict plays out on 15 different maps, varying from blue steel industrial complexes to lush, vegetated outdoor levels. Regardless of the environs though, the objective on each map is identical; to destroy the enemy's portal, through which its reinforcements are spawned. Locating said transportation device usually doesn't involve too much reconnaissance, but destroying it can be a tad trickier if your opponents are defensively minded. There are infantry types that are configured to operate in support roles, to bolster the longevity of their own portal while having the capability to inflict a modicum of damage on the enemy's. The Mage class, for instance, has a dual Mend/Repair skill, which can restore lost hit points to a friendly portal, yet has the opposite effect if cast in the vicinity of the opposing teams portal.   More generally, each infantry type has three skills it can call upon, in addition to a personal arsenal that comprises three weapons. The Android's Repair/Demolish skill is somewhat equivalent to the mend/repair trait of the Mage, while there are other similarly functional albeit differently named skills that are available to both factions. The Ion Barrier that an Android can throw up performs in the same manner as the Ward barricade of the Mage, in that both provide a concentric column of energy around the point of casting, which will harm any enemy that comes within its boundary. Some classes also have the ability to produce runes, which when picked up by an ally, will have a boosting effect on one of the recipient's characteristics. The Assassin class, for example, can produce runes that turn team members temporarily invisible, with the duration of the effect depending on the skill level of the character that created the rune.   Each round of the conflict begins with the combatants of the two factions materializing at their respective portals. More tactical players may then wish to consider whether to operate in a defensive, offensive or dynamic role on the battlefield. With regards to the first of these, portals are often placed within a cramped structure or locale, sometimes accessible by a single, narrow passage. This is easily defendable by obstructing it with an Ion Barrier or Ward, and consequently, offence can be a rather difficult endeavor if your opponents have adopted this tactic. On a few occasions, I witnessed either my own or the opposing team using this stratagem to such an extent that multiple barriers were placed in the access route, making it arduous to get close enough to inflict damage on the portal. This could either be seen as challenging or rather frustrating, but perhaps it would be a prudent consideration for a future patch to preclude the possibility of a team consisting solely of one infantry type.      The weapons of The Order and The Chosen are styled in a manner that appropriately complements the respective technological and fantasy themes of the combatants who wield them. Those of The Order consist mainly of aesthetically futuristic firearms, some of which are rather similar - in terms of the ammunition they deliver - to contemporary weaponry, while others are a tad more outlandish. The VEE3 Phalanx falls into the latter category, as it launches a volley of explosive energy bolts, while in secondary fire mode, it operates more as a ground pounder, able to inflict considerable splash damage. Armaments such as the Minigun or XL5 are solid, modern day-style shooting irons, and while they lack the lethality of the Phalanx, they do deliver their ammunition to a target almost instantaneously, foregoing the need to add lead if the target is moving.  Although there are 32 weapons in all, each infantry class is limited to a maximum of three disparate armaments. Of the more exotic ones, there's a rifle for the Wastelander class that spews chemical goo, which aside from having a corrosive effect, also reduces the maneuverability of the recipient, making it a less elusive target for subsequent fire. The Wastelander can also wield a futuristic sniper rifle of sorts.  Officially designated as weapons, the Mage's three offensive abilities are actually three different spell types that can be conjured using a suitably arcane looking, gnarled staff. The least powerful of these unleashes a small bolt of frost that can have the effect of temporarily stunning an opponent. More striking in both an aesthetic and potent sense is the Lightning spell, which delivers a stream of forking electricity to a target area. The most formidable projectile the Mage can summon is the deceptively mundane named Fireball, which has near maximum damage potential. Of the three, the Frostbolt spell doesn't have any special requirements before you can cast it, but Fireball and Lightning invocations are only possible if your avatar has met some basic prerequisites; Lightning requires a minimum dexterity rating of 15, while Fireball requires a similar number of strength points.   What did you think of Purge?  LithTech Talon is the engine responsible for Purge's graphics, and although this technology can hardly be considered bleeding edge, Freeform has managed to produce some fairly impressive visuals with it. The environments, and in particular those of the al fresco levels, are highly detailed, with a variety of well-defined textures. Smoke and reflection effects, translucency and bump mapping all appear to have been implemented, and the title will run smoothly on even a modest system. Perhaps a little less accomplished, however, is the aural facet. Some of the vocal commands you can utter to your teammates are a tad indistinct, while in terms of suitability, weapon sound effects are something of a mixed bag, ranging from the aptly ominous whine of the Minigun to the eyebrow raising 'pebble in water' plop that accompanies the Frostbite spell. Purge is arguably the most notable example of what is a rather specialized niche within the action genre. For sure, the concept of class-based, team-oriented conflict is hardly a new one, but the added depth afforded by the skills and leveling system is something that few, if any, ostensibly similar titles presently boast. The character development aspect isn't without its negative points though, as new players can find themselves outgunned by veterans of any particular server. However, as even casual observers of the title will no doubt have noticed, Freeform continues to refine and improve upon its endeavor, which can only bode well for present players as well as those who have yet to bear arms in its caustic clash of ideologies. However, there are a number of grievous problems that just cannot be denied. Currently, the actively playing community is practically nonexistent. A sheer lack of modes hurts, a distinctly copying style mars, and some unpolished, ~like to get you stuck between two rocks~ level design is unacceptable.When others do most that is attempted here, only better and sometimes even for free, its hard to recognize and tout the few true positives of Purge, regardless of however redeeming they may be on their own. Ultimately, this action title is basic and bland, a testament to cliched design and rudimentary play mechanics.", "date": "Apr 29, 2003"}
