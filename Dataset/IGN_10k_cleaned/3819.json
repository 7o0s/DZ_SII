One such game, Chaos Legion, surprised many people by not being what it initially seemed. At first it felt like a pure button masher, a great-looking action game with little depth. Soon thereafter, however, people learned of the game's minute strategic and RPG elements. What is really going on with this game?   In our recent video interview with Producer Yoshinori Ono, we learned that Capcom intended on letting journalists and players found out on their own what Chaos Legion had inside it and for them to make up their own minds. Ono said the game is open for people to customize and to control on their own. This is no doubt true, players can indeed customize their legions and play the game relatively differently each time through. But the other side of the coin is that Chaos Legion, while interesting just below the surface, doesn't offer much more than a tiny bit of strategy or RPG elements.     The fact is Capcom's newest game is a solid, mildly interesting action game featuring a little bit of everything -- juggles, combos, interesting creature design, and a Devil May Cry stylishness, but it never elevates in strategy, design or affect above moderately amusing and mindless button mashing. It's good for an afternoon in the summer, but hardly worth writing home about. Think Dynasty Warriors only made by Capcom and you'll get an idea of what Chaos Legion is like.

But it's deceiving in at least two major ways. What's interesting/disturbing about the game is its presentation and the developer's overall desired affect. On its surface, it looks like the twin brother to one of Capcom's biggest recent phenoms, Devil May Cry. The European castles and archaic Italian-style villas and hill cities, stone courtyards and the like look very much like those seen in DMC. The lead character, adorned in full-length trench coat, resembles Dante in affect if not in purpose. He even taps his sword on his shoulder at the start of each level much the way Dante did in DMC. The third-person camera angles enable players to see the action well enough, and strangely enough, the combos often result in juggles, which strangely enough, were also a big part of DMC. And much like its brethren, players can upgrade various elements in the game just like in DMC.      Sure, games before DMC offered juggles, European cities, characters with attitude, and upgrade systems, but not in such a distinct manner and not in so similar a package. So, for all intents and purposes, Capcom willfully created a game that rides on the shoulders of its action brother and yet attempts desperately to play differently. It only partially succeeds.    Chaos Legion is also deceptive in another way. It starts off with an entirely obscure and confusing story and gives players the most powerful of all legions, Thanatos, and then takes him away. After that, players must earn each legion on their own. So, at first the game is actually boring. I suspect many gamers will either fall asleep or simply not bother past the first hour unless they are purely fascinated with redundancy and there is simply nothing else to do or another distracting game to play. Chaos Legion only becomes mildly interesting after players earn at least two legions, after which they can begin building up the powers of each. So, Chaos Legion doesn't start off very well, and it makes a bit of a mess of explaining exactly what's going on. It's not until the about two-thirds of the way through it does the story begin making some kind of sense, or grow interesting.   After the first couple of missions, however, some things become clearer, and the game actually becomes moderately fun. First, collecting all the legions is enjoyable, given the talents of each one. Believe it or not, in this way, Chaos Legion is a little like an gothic Pokemon game. A legion is a soul-based army specializing in a particular kind of attack. Lead character Sieg is able to call a new one each time he collects the corresponding crest. We've written a huge feature on all the legions (Anarchy's New Order), which include armies that wield swords, specialize in archery, create powerful walls or use incredibly powerful brute force. You gotta catch them all, as they say.    Once players collect them, they can use the energy collected from their souls, in addition to the hits, attacks and combos to convert them into power for themselves and even their legions. Each legion comprises these characteristics: force, assist, enchant, attack and defense, all of which can be powered up. By using a legion during a level, it earns points which then can be attributed to its growth. So, players can pick just two to power up continually or select from a wide range (there are seven in all) and distribute the power freely. Powering up legions, watching them grow in numbers, strength and size and then seeing them in action is very satisfying indeed.    Which is what Ono was pointing out -- players can play the game essentially the way they want to, customizing them own legions to their satisfaction. What's especially cool about upgrading them, especially in the enchant category is that section affects Seig's abilities. So, not only do the choices of legions affect players' future legion, they fuel their own potential abilities.    It's good fun until one realizes that despite the legion they choose, the game is essentially a simple beat-'em-up through and through, which, despite its various strategies and powerups, is pretty dang mindless. Strategies? Players must simplistically alternate between seizing enemies with legions or attack them. The level of strategy doesn't really matter all that much because players can choose any legion to fight through any level, regardless of their talents. RPG elements? Good to a small extent, and cool when you see the results, but neither very deep nor very interesting. Smash, attack, beat the targets senseless and move on -- that's the strategy in every level, pure and simple.      To be fair, the premise behind Chaos Legion is indeed interesting, but the gameplay never really carries out the theory to an extent that makes much of a difference. The legions are cool to a degree: They can defend or attack and players can send them on especially powerful assignments using Triangle. Players can switch between two legions in a level and no more, which in essence makes them decide beforehand which legions they'll powerup first and foremost.    Item collection plays a good part in the game too. Players collect crests to command legions, they gather health and soul power, and they assemble icons enabling them to build Thanatos, the most powerful legion of all. Also, players find icons that provide essential abilities, such as returning to previous levels to try again, or to find something they couldn't get, such as only a double jump could get them. The bosses and sub-bosses, well, they're easy and mindless. Oh! You even get to play a secondary character, which proves my DMC theory even more. Add to that Arcia actually plays like Dante and it's all pretty much there.      Graphics  Design wise, Capcom has assembled one of the best quilt works of other games I have ever seen. Chaos Legion has all the trappings of DMC -- European cities, gothic look and feel, great texture work, and a brooding tough guy as the lead character. It plays a wee bit like Dynasty Warriors at its core, but its monster design resembles more than I am willing to say the Panzer Dragoon series. All of which are good things, if only Chaos Legion felt more original at its core.   Technically, Chaos Legion's engine is performing on overdrive nearly all the time. The level of creatures onscreen simultaneously is impressive, with everything moving about in 60 frames per second. The levels are linear, so there is less on screen than say Dynasty Warriors or Grand Theft Auto, but it still pull its weight in textures, motion and framerate.    Sound  There is little to say here about the benefits of the music. The mix of rock-like songs, techno beats and the like never offend nor do they stimulate the soul much at all. The sound effects are various and constant, providing players with a raucous cacophony of banging metal, screeching enemies, pulsing weapons and thumping punches.Chaos Legion is an interesting example of Capcom's Devil May Cry phenomenon at work. It's gothic in look, ~stylish~ at first impression, and filled with a character who seems to have attitude. It's a product of Capcom's attempt to try new things, but in the end, it's not all that. The game starts off slowly to the point of being dull. But it does grow more appealing, intensifying with new legions that create additional choices and more upgrade opportunies. It even throws in a second playable character. However, while the game promises something interesting, Chaos Legion levels off mid-way through and never elevates over redundant button masher status. Good for a rent but only buyable if you're a dedicated collector of all things Capcom.", "date": "Aug 5, 2003"}
