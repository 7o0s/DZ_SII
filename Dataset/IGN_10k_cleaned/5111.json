{"name": "Time Crisis: Crisis Zone", "name_review": "Time Crisis: Crisis Zone", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/10/12/time-crisis-crisis-zone", "text": "is a game about shooting a giant man in the face one hundred and eighty thousand times to prevent him from throwing barrels at your character's head. It's a stylized on-rails first-person shooter that features the same timed zones and ducking mechanics that the original Time Crisis game popularized so long ago. It's also completely wacky, like every polygonal on-rails shooting game has been since Virtual Cop first taught us how likely a million mobsters held up in a construction yard actually was.   If you have a light gun please use it, as Namco has managed to lessen the horrible white flashing effect that's plagued the genre for so long. But if you don't have a light gun, just go bananas with the controller anyway. It really doesn't matter. Crisis Zone is easy enough to the point that you can beat the entire game without any kind of trouble. Then you can go back and play some worthless challenge modes later. Honestly, I believe I could play this game on the surface of the sun or on the bottom of the sea and still have no difficulty in winning.   The ducking mechanic is too forgiving. It's possible to avoid the hits of practically any enemy in the entire game at any time by crouching (even if it's a missile or tank round), and the only thing that a Crisis Zone player needs to remember is to constantly hold the duck button between scene transitions. When you move from one scene to the next and you're already protected, you'll never even get hit -- less a stray knife thrower catches you off guard, which happens exactly once since memorizing every pattern is simple. This makes Crisis Zone incredibly easy to milk, front to back. Just duck, transition into an area, and then start popping people. If you get hit, you'll score perfect next round, so no worries.   Breaking Stuff Most of the enemies in Crisis Zone are of the generically armored, ~I'm a legionnaire from Cobra or a Star Trek red shirt~ variety. There are some who throw knives, some who lob grenades, and others that'll shoot. You'll really actually only need to worry about getting hit by specific people in any given scene, though, and they're always easy to identify. The rest are just there to take up space and keep the clock ticking down. If you're lucky enough to own two GunCons, try plugging both of them in. Now the space-takers won't even be good at keeping the clock ticking.   What's the point then? Well, Crisis Zone does offer some really sweet interactivity. Nearly everything in the game world can be broken, busted, shot through, bent, or otherwise deformed, which makes shooting wildly into the five environments of the story mode (though one is just a single boss room) more enjoyable than most other gun games. Even though this kind of interactivity is an impressive inclusion, I can't help but point out that Die Hard Trilogy did the same thing nearly eight years ago on the PSOne, and even it managed to include two separate games on top of that. What do we get?   As far as an unnecessarily kind, forgiving and passive hand sees it, Crisis Zone is an excellent light gun game. Unfortunately, the practical hand just wants to hit things now, because Crisis Zone is a short, meaningless, totally unsatisfying title. It's painfully linear, still features the same hackneyed storyline you could supplant into Time Crisis or Virtua Cop or House of the Dead or that movie Space Truckers with Dennis Hopper, and it even manages to last about 30 minutes or an hour if you really, really want it to. But hey, at least we can blow stuff up!   So what exactly is going on here? Why is the genre stagnant? The problem is that these games, Crisis Zone specifically, are being designed exclusively for the arcade market where no one cares about arcade depth or ingenuity.   Crisis Zone was originally an arcade title released five years ago... Five years! And here I am wondering why simple stuff like enemy bodies not disappearing into thin air hasn't been put in yet. Five years! I'm definitely crazy. After five years it's time to wonder why there aren't more branching paths, why we can't actually race to a goal against a friend, and why we don't have an actual storyline that wasn't pulled out of a dead horse. After five frickin' years we should start wondering about the more advanced stuff, like why we don't have more options when it comes to ducking, why the EyeToy isn't supported to allow us to physically duck in real life, and why every Namco shooting game ever made isn't included on this disc just because that's what has to happen at this point. Five years later and all we get are some fools on jet packs! This frivolous package is just another half-hearted attempt at milking a genre without actually putting anything new into it.   Five years time... Five years and we get a new zone and six bosses (the helicopter, tank, and computer room fight with the tyrannical Derrick are of zero interest, by the by). Five years and that's what we get. Amazing. Thanks.Crisis Zone is a light gun game. Why does that mean it has to be a sad, simple, short, and unfulfilling light gun game? I don't know, but that's the way it is. Crisis Zone does nothing new, but vainly tries to capitalize off an eight-year-old gimmick so that to establish a unique kind of worth that never truly gets backed by any actual game.Crisis Zone is the straw that just broke this horses' back. Enough is enough. I've been playing and loving light gun titles since I finally realized how to reload in that stupid, stupid Mad Dog McCree ~game~ of so long ago. Now you're pretty much asking me to play the same thing I did when I first dumped fifty cents into Virtua Cop? Nice try.Do something new or cut it the hell out.
