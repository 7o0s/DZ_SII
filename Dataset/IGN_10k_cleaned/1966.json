While it may seem a tad implausible -- flying planes through tight holes low enough to bump your head on -- it could make a fun arcade racer. I say ~could~ because Bravo Air Race, although it does follow this premise, is so flawed as to render it un-fun.  Start the game by picking from a variety of vintage-to-modern planes. The planes handle according to their       construction, with some slow but agile, and       others like rockets with broken steering       wheels. The very idea of being able to brake in the air is ludicrous, but once I got past the reality barrier I was able to control the planes pretty well.  Bravo's major problem is the pop-up. In a game like this, where you're constantly scanning the horizon to judge when to start turning, the less pop-up present the better. Unfortunately, developer Xing has ignored this, making it impossible to judge any upcoming turn. Repeatedly slamming into walls is not my idea of fun.  The environment textures don't help either. They all seem to blend together, making it tough to determine where the walls are when you're in a tunnel. Again, we're back to slamming into walls. Repeatedly.  And, even if you did find yourself enjoying the game (I doubt it, but anyway) there's no circuit mode. You can only race one track at a time.   Unless you fancy crashing a lot and being very frustrated, avoid Bravo Air Race.  Adam Douglas", "date": "Oct 10, 1997"}
