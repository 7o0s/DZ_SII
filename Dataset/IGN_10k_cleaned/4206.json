{"name": "XIII", "name_review": "XIII", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/18/xiii-2", "text": "As most gamers have probably heard by now, XIII is a cel-shaded first-person shooter based on a French comic book--excuse moi, ~graphic novel~--about a military operative who's suffering from amnesia and is being chasedafter by both the authorities and a shadowy group of Bad People who want to do Bad Things. It feels like a bouquet of Hitman 2, No One Lives Forever, and the movie The Bourne Identity, but manages to distinguish itself, just barely. The question remains, however, if XIII can provide a compelling experience, no matter what its pedigree, and it has a   XIII begins with you washed up on a beach in sunny Southern California, rescued by a Baywatch-style beauty and taken to the lifeguard shack. You'll get a few flashbacks that suggest an undercover operation gone wrong, but you won't get much chance to ponder what's happened before the bullets start flying. All you have to go on is a key to a bank, since you have no memory, and you'll have to plow through bunches of bad guys before you can get there.   I'll say right up front that the character models look pretty amazing. Everyone in the game truly looks like a graphic novel drawing expanded into three dimensions. Thick lines, cel shading, and a stylized feel help to put you inside a comic book. The console versions don't make any glaring shortcuts to meet performance demands, unlike Max Payne 2 which at least on the PS2 reveals highly reduced texture quality.   The environments, however, don't get as much of the stylized cel-shading attention. At first glance, it's difficult to tell you're even in a cel-shaded world (until someone comes onto the screen). The weapon in your hand is nicely done, but environment surfaces don't always look like they came out of a comic, not nearly to the same degree as the character models.   There is a lot of location variety, though. You'll be on rooftops, in tunnels, on snowy mountains, underwater, in deserts, and crawling through dockyards and more in your quest to find out who you are, who's after you, and how to stay alive. With the outdoor environments, XIII would have benefited greatly from a more open-ended level design, and the Unreal Warfare engine can certainly handle such a task. Instead, you never quite get a sense of traveling through a real environment, especially during the snowy mountains areas.    The visualized sound effects are pretty neat, though. When the lifeguard gets killed by a sweep of gunfire, the letters ~TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT~ go sweeping across the screen in comic books letters. A patrolling nearby enemy will ~TAP TAP TAP~ down the hallway. It's pretty cool to watch and also allows you to pinpoint their location when you can't get a line-of-sight on them. Also, when there's an enemy in the distance, they will be briefly bracketed by a red box, and sometimes given a comic book inset in the corner of the screen.   The best aspect of the sound is the music. Instead of a symphonic, rock, or techno thing, the developers went with jazz. It's actually pretty cool, and the mood switches dynamically as you move in and out of the action. The weapon and environmental sound effects, however, are overshadowed by other recent action games, such as those from the Medal of Honor series. In fact, the shotgun sounds decidedly weak, and from a distance sounds no more threatening than a pop gun, despite its serious damage capability. A little more thump would have helped across the board.   You'll want to make sure you have the right weapon in hand, though, when you want to take out the distant targets, and you'll have to rely primarily on the sniper rifle and crossbow to do this. The rifle is loud, though, and will draw enemies to your location. The crossbow, while silent, had to be led ahead of the target since the projectile moves so slowly. And it takes a while to reload. At mid-range, however, the AK-47 and assault rifle will cut down even a heavily armored foe. And at close range, the shotgun is a one-shot kill if you aim for the head.    Since the assault rifle also comes with a grenade launcher, it's actually so versatile that you'll end up using it all the time. This is better than having a bunch of weapons that all have some artificial weakness requiring you to constantly shuffle to the best one for the situation, but the lack of required variety in XIII does make combat tactically dull after a while. You'll need the harpoon launcher underwater and the bazooka for armored vehicles, but the mini-gun is quickly overshadowed and the M-60 too heavy and slow to reload.   The starter pistol has a high rate of fire, but it will take half a clip to take out one guy at medium range, unless you're aiming for the head, which is a little unpredictable with the auto-aiming. The .44 Magnum is much more effective and has longer range, but ammo is harder to find. Instead of breaking open boxes all the time, you'll take most of your ammo off the bodies of your enemies. Since you will need lots of ammo for a few situations in the game, there is no reward for stealthy play. And the environments are so linearly designed that you'll end up having to kill everyone anyway.   All the kills are pretty splattery, so this definitely isn't for the kids, despite the comic book style. While not as brutal as Dead to Rights, which will leave entrails splashed on walls, you do get a gruesome three-panel close-up with sniped headshots with the rifle and crossbow. The crossbow is especially gory because you get to see it stuck in the guy's head. We recommend a light meal before playing.   You won't get impaled much yourself, though. In addition to two types of armor and two levels of health pack, you can also wear a helmet, making you a hardened target against all but explosive projectiles. If you find yourself just floating through the game, though, you can play on the high difficulty mode, in which you'll take realistic damage.    But these details become just so much background noise when the shooting begins. And what you take away from each battle is the sense that the enemies are only rudimentarily aware of you. They seem to have trigger points where they will come after you, but they will always find cover behind the same location, and generally won't move from that spot when you come around to shoot them from the side. If they are not scripted to find cover after being triggered, they will simply crouch and shoot only a few feet away from you, or do some cursory dodging dance that isn't too useful for them since you can auto-lock on a target.   Auto-locking isn't nearly as skill-reducing, though, as it is on other games, like Tomb Raider, where Lara will automatically aim her guns even when you can't see the enemy. Your crosshairs have to come within a certain proximity that becomes wider as the target gets closer. It's quite handy because the analog sticks aren't responsive and precise enough to aim without help in most first-person shooters.   However, the controller is actually pretty intuitive in the long run. Since XIII has two separate inventories, one for weapons and another for miscellaneous items like health packs, keys, the grappling hook, and keycards, it's handy to be able to just move around the D-pad to navigate the miscellaneous inventory. You can get to the grappling hook pretty quickly. The only drawback is being able to quickly select a specific weapon, but this is not an uncommon control problem for a first-person console game. It does seem kind of odd that you don't immediately heal yourself when you pick one up, but this does allow you to carry multiple packs for when things get really heavy, despite the fact that being able to carry multiple health packs smacks of incomplete difficulty balance.   Unfortunately, grappling hook locations can be difficult to spot. When your crosshairs get close enough to a nearby hook, it will get bracketed by a white box. But instead of simply hitting the Action button to attach, you have to dig out your grappler. A few extra button pushes can mean the difference between life and death. Plus, there were a couple areas where I simply could not find a hook, but had to use one in order to reach a distant spot without killing myself.    This is not the only situation in which you might get stuck. The game is full of scripted triggers, so sometimes you have to be in a very specific spot in order to move things along. After making a daring escape early in the game, you have to go running across some rooftops to dodge your enemies. You'll have an escort, and at one point you'll need a certain weapon in order to kill some guys and move the game along. She will call you over to her, but if you don't stand right in front of her, she won't give you that weapon, or indicate that you need that weapon, or simply give it to you of her own accord. It also isn't clear why she couldn't use the weapon herself. Gameplay-wise, it makes sense, because you want to be in the driver's seat of the action. But in the context of the story, the logic is a little murky.   A little later on, you have to rescue a high-ranking guy in the military. During the escape, he makes no attempt to pick up a weapon and defend himself, although he never hesitates to lead the way, forcing you to frantically take point to prevent him from getting gunned down. Then, bewilderingly, he hands you a weapon before the final segment of that level that you'll need to take out some distant targets. The mind boggles.   The general's voice acting, performed by Adam West of the 60s Batman TV show, is rather good, however. He's actually an appropriate choice, because Batman comes from the comic book tradition, complete with visualized sound effects. David Duchovny does the voice of XIII, and Eve does the voice of one of his colleagues. XIII is a pretty quiet action hero, though, with the least amount of dialogue by far. Since there's a lot of story told with cut scene vignettes and interactive flashbacks, he seems like he should be more than just a pretty face like in Serious Sam or Duke Nukem. I'm not expecting Max Payne-level droning, but there is a convoluted story here in which his character feels too passive. A few more voiceovers during a lull in the action would have given an increased sense of story direction. As it stands, there's a ton of running and gunning, and a little more story would have counterbalanced the underwhelming AI and crossed the threshold into a more resonant experience.   The Thirteen Soundtrack Perhaps the coolest thing about The Thirteen Soundtrack is that it works outside of the game as an entertaining slab of mid-tempo futuro funk with tinges of '70s throwback and a decidedly hip-hop oriented undercurrent. That it's put together like a seamless mixtape is all the more impressive, giving the CD the feeling of a continuous score that shifts tempo and mood with sophisticated ease...  Want to read more?

While MP2 did not even ship with netcode, XII provides deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag, and Sabotage, which you can play against local players or online with the UbiSoft Game Service. In Sabotage, you defend or attack a series of checkpoints, depending on which side you're on. The attackers win by blowing up all checkpoints with dynamite, and the defenders win by keeping the enemy at bay until the timer runs down. Unfortunately, the GameCube version doesn't come with online support.NOLF, Hitman 2 and Bourne Identity make it difficult for XIII to distinguish itself, once you get beyond the stylish presentation. The characters are mostly colorful, but the AI is no match for auto-lock and a little side-stepping of your own. The story is fairly deep for an action game, but you sometimes have to reach some hard-to-locate triggers in order to keep things moving. The character models are quite awesome, but apparently not nearly as much work was done on stylizing the environment as well.XIII does have a great story-driven sheen, but at it's core, it's weighed down by some occasional bewildering flaws, in addition to the lackluster weapons and simple combat we usually see in lesser productions. Perhaps if the enemy AI had had just a little more self-defense capability, instead of generally standing and shooting, it would have been better. Other games have gotten away with this by using large numbers of foes and/or unique, satisfying weapons, or multiple ways to achieve a goal. Without these elements, XIII is a fun but linear play-through with middle-of-the-road AI.", "date": "Nov 18, 2003"}
