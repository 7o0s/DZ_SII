{"name": "War Gods", "name_review": "War Gods", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/05/30/war-gods", "text": "Midway, a company known more recently for its Mortal Kombat franchise, has tried to take the successful formula found within the hit series and bring it to the next level in full 3D. Unfortunately, what the game lacks in character design it fails to make up for in graphic fluidity and playability.  The story behind War Gods is as follows: Billions of years ago a being from a distant galaxy was transporting life giving Ore through our solar system. Unfortunately, the chaos of creation was still quite fluent and caused his ship to crash, spreading the Ore over the surface of our planet Earth. Over time, ten humans came into contact with this Ore and were forever changed into ~super evolved warriors~. These are the War Gods.  In what can best be described as Mortal Kombat gone 3D, War Gods incorporates pretty backgrounds, traditional MK gameplay and all the gore that made the series a hit to begin with. With ten characters to choose from and a few hidden surprises the game provides enough variety to keep players motivated, but comical character design and sloppy graphics keep it from becoming a fighting classic.  War Gods was originally an arcade game, and despite the hype surrounding its initial release it never quite lived up to what fans of the genre were expecting. Midway, aware of this fact, recalled parts of the development team in hopes of improving upon the game for the Nintendo 64 port and for the most part it was successful.  Two major flaws plagued the arcade version: Horribly bad AI (Artificial intelligence) and choppy gameplay. The Nintendo 64 version improves on both, but certainly doesn't conquer either feat. While the AI in the N64 port is arguably better, it seems oddly unbalanced and often discouraging. For example, even on the easiest level of challenge the opponents are often cheap, effortlessly throwing everything they've got at you. We appreciate a balanced match as much as the next guy, but when your character can be killed off in a few seconds flat it's hard to keep up a healthy degree of optimism.  Unfortunately, the graphics in this game are not its saving grace as sloppy animation keeps the characters from coming to life. Everyone seems to move with robotic,  stiff inhuman maneuvers and actions. War Gods has a polygonal look to it. Simple backgrounds rotate the character as he moves from position to position. The whole process seems thrown together, however, with poor animation and glitchy texture mapped enviornments. One example being the fact that you can see through your opponents body everytime you win a match -- a very annoying glitch.  Midway, in a process called ~digital skin~,  digitized the likeness of real life actors onto 3D characters with texture maps in an effort to create the most realistic looking fighters in a 3D world. While this effect is initially nice, again the animation and terrible character design detract greatly from the whole experience.   The characters in this game can only be described as uninspired. With a choice of 10 characters (plus two bosses accessible through hidden codes) we commend Midway on a valiant attempt to give players a good selection -- the only problem is that the selection is pathetic and comical.  Ahau Kin, an evil high priest, looks like a cross between an Indian and a reject from Gilligan's Island; Kabuki Joe,  a medieval samurai, resembles something similar to Ronald McDonald after a freak science experiment. One of the more interesting characters, Anubis, looks to be taken straight out of the movie 'Stargate.' Maximus, a mighty gladiator, walks around in red BVD's as he pummels weapons at your face; Warhead, a government operative, seems to be taken out of a bad 'B' movie; Pagan and Vallah, the two female roles, are not so much characters in themselves as they are a chance to dress up beautiful girls in skimpy outfits and watch them shake their body around when the match is over. While the general opinion around the office varies, the majority of us found ourselves actually laughing at the design of some of these characters.  War Gods plays very similar to Mortal Kombat -- only with a 3D button to move in and out of the arena's. The control is good, with a variety of moves and combos at your disposal. One notable annoyance is the position of the 3D button (L button), which makes it virtually impossible to master the ~3D~ environment as your hand struggles to come to grips with the N64 controller.  Some of the character moves are incredibly cool, however, with Tak and Anubis being two prime examples. Tak is a giant rock monster who hurls rocks at his opponents when he's not bashing them over the head with one. Anubis seems to be the War Gods equivalent of Raiden in the MK series, with a control scheme that even rivals his predecessor. Multiple combos can be performed using a variation of most combo systems. All in all, we were pleased with the control in the game, but not overly excited by it.  Another plus was Midway's use of music and sound effects. From the opening credits and through the whole game you are subjected to constant voice comments ranging from ~War Gods!~ to, ~Unbelievable!~ whenever a fine combo is achieved. While at first this effect was rather satisfying as time wears on the voice becomes an annoyance.  The music in the game is standard, but enjoyable. With techno back-beats and guitar riffs among other forms of musical style, the game has a solid variety of music to keep you awake, though the limited storage available to cartridges will certainly be noticed.  Finally, the fatalities continue in the style of Mortal Kombat -- violent and humorous. Pulling beating hearts out of opponents never felt so good.        War Gods was a good idea that went sour with flawed character design and choppy animation derivitive of its core. That said, it should be noted that developer Eurocom managed an excellent port of the game to Nintendo 64. It's just too bad that there wasn't much there to begin with. Unless you loved Mortal Kombat and don't mind a few uninspired characters to play around with, we recommend waiting.", "date": "May 30, 1997"}
