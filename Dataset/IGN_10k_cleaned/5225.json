I also know that I'm probably going to get a lot of hate for this review, even though I still think it's a decent, if not particularly brilliant, game.  I was a huge fan of Allied Assault and played through the single player a good three or four times before I put it down for good. It was balanced, fast, and mostly a lot of fun. The weapons felt good, the pace was nice, and I felt like I knew what I was doing at all times. Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault is not Allied Assault. There were situations both intense and extremely fun, but there were just too many other extraordinarily average or poor things that I'm having a hard time really being able to completely enjoy it. It isn't a horrible game, it's just slightly better than average, mostly due to the high production quality that EA has been so good about throwing into each of their games lately.   The Pacific Theater of World War II has been seriously neglected compared to its European counterpart up to this point. There are a gazillion WWII games in just about every genre category you can think of, but only hardcore strategy games and flight sims have really taken the time to dive into the other part of the war, which if you might recall, was a rather large and costly one. One thing that EA has done well here is present the time period and personal struggle of the soldiers stuck in the middle. Everything from the menus that play world radio news bits about the war along with commercials to the way the music mixes with the gameplay was clearly crafted with the period and dramatic nature of the subject matter in mind.   In that mind, EA decided to give Pacific Assault a very Hollywood movie type of feel. Cutscenes lead the charge, but it's really the situation, comradery, and spectacular musical score (which at times actually reminds me very much of Mafia) that drive the point home. This may not be Saving Private Ryan or The Thin Red Line, but Pacific Assault certainly brings dramatic and terrifying moments to interactive entertainment.     Gameplay begins before the actual story does as throngs of troops plow through the water towards the Tarawa Atoll. You, as Tommy Coughlin, along with your three friends from boot camp are about to storm the beach on D-Day, Japanese style. After a bit of grunting and shooting, the flashbacks begin and the story of Tommy's road to Tarawa begins, starting with training, which takes way too long for my taste. I know how to shoot a weapon. I know how to throw a grenade... well maybe not these extraordinarily bouncy Flubber brand grenades. I know how to use stationary weapons. I understand the need to set up the relationship between the four men that end up fighting for most of the game together, but there had to be some better way to do it than force veteran players to sit through a tutorial on the basics of playing a shooter when it would have been nice to skip that entire section.   Once past the tutorial, players will travel through several of the major battles of the Pacific Theater of World War II including Pearl Harbor, Guadalcanal, and Tarawa. Mission types range from rail shooters to intense action sequences with many friendly and enemy units trying to put holes in one another. There are attack missions, defense missions, and even one that sits you in the cockpit of a plane. While mission do vary like that, most of Pacific Assault is about running through jungles shooting at Japanese soldiers. Missions are generally very linear (though there are a couple of points where different paths to the goal can be taken) and also very difficult. Learning to use save games often as well as learning to use your medic wisely (he carries four medkits for you for each mission) is the most important aspect of completing this game, especially since you'll end up being shot hundreds of times before the game is done.    There are definitely sections of Pacific Assault that get your blood pumping and are about as intense as can be, but for the most part, you'll be running through jungles. These missions become predictable and even the intensity wears off about the time you start seeing enemies pop-in once you cross that invisible line that triggers their spawn. There's nothing more disconcerting and frustrating than walking along the side of a path up against the tree wall only to have a couple of disgruntled Japanese infantrymen magically spawn in front of your face and begin stabbing you as you desperately try to melee attack as you run out of bullets and the reload animation kicks in. Even better, in Pacific Assault's much briefer version of Snipertown from Allied Assault, snipers will also pop into existence only after you've triggered it. So no matter how careful you are the first time through checking the trees for bad guys, you will get shot. You can check the trees all you like, but the bad guys won't be there until the trigger is hit. After a bit of trial and error, you can scope in on where the bad guys will be and shoot them when they suddenly appear.   But in those magical moments when everything does work well and the illusion isn't spoiled, there are some great battles to be had. Enemies start screaming, your squad begins barking they're actions, observations, and curses and you have to work feverishly not to get hit by the thousands of bullets flying through the air. The sound, which is done very well, kicks in and the intensity grows.   If only the combat had been as good as the intensity of the situation desired, Pacific Assault could have been genius. There were a few reasons the combat didn't add up to a perfect sum, lead by technical issues. Those players with lower end machines are going to need to hope for the best when turning texture detail down. One of the hallmarks of a good shooter is twitch reaction and knowing that when you point at something, you'll probably hit it and that you'll get some sort of visual response to let you know you're doing a good job. But with the performance issues and mouse lag, it's hard to get that feeling. Instead of feeling like a highly trained soldier considered a hero that goes above and beyond the call of duty, it feels like you're swimming and trying not to drown.     You would expect the game to be singularly beautiful to cause this kind of problem. For certain, the game looks good, some parts better than others, but a lot of the attraction is in the high res textures and pixel shader 2.0, which unfortunately had to be turned off in order to stop the extreme mouse lag that plagued me upon first loading the game. That said, what makes the look of the game work is the extremely thick jungle environments. It's done well enough that it's sometimes easy to forget that you're stuck on a very linear path through the level.   Playing alongside troops is also great, especially when you have an emotional attachment to some of the guys you fight alongside. My problems stem from their intelligence. While they move and react fairly well to enemies, creating a sense of team realism, they don't really seem to do much. It's hard when there's enemies out in the open, running towards you with a bayonet wanting to stab you in the face and no one helps. No one cares if you live or die aside from your medic friend.   They will take some guys down, however. It's obvious that they're supposed to leave most of the killing to you, which is appropriate, but it's hard to get fully immersed when these supposedly well trained soldiers seem so useless most of the time. One of the very first missions had me attacking a radio tower and holding it. While manning a stationary gun, an enemy managed to wander up the embankment and start stabbing me in the back. Now, if my squad mates had all been wounded and the situation dire, I could understand how that would happen. But when I jump off of the gun, turn around, and see 5-6 guys standing there while I'm being mercilessly punctured to death, I get frustrated. Even though I had all of these men with me, I still had that ~one man against the world~ feeling, which doesn't seem like the point.    Enemy AI was actually fairly good. They're good at finding cover, taking advantage of the terrain to flank you, and generally making your life a misery. Once they've come to the end of their tolerance of you, they'll actually throw a little kamikaze run at you. In some cases though the AI is too good. They have the uncanny knack to shoot you through thick brush when there's no way you can see them, leading you to believe that they can't see you. It's aggravating. I found myself wondering where I was getting shot from on more than one occasion. Your squad mates will shout out hugely helpful remarks like ~He's up there!~ and ~They're above us!~ and ~Muzzle fire!~ while you sit there sweating and cursing in your head wondering where they're talking about and what muzzle fire they're looking at. Most of the time, I only see the bullets after they're lodged in my pulpy body.   Speaking of pulpy bodies riddled with bullets, Pacific Assault also comes complete with multiplayer. Up to now, my experience hasn't been the friendliest, but by the end of my playtime, things were looking up. For the most part, my enjoyment has been seriously marred by some horrendous lag. I was finally able to find servers that were virtually lag free, leaving my mouse lag to continue as the only problem.   Three different game types are available for those looking to test their skills out online, including Free-for-All, Team Deathmatch, and the most exciting, Invasion. The problem with the types other than invasion seems to stem from the size of the maps. They're a bit large for anything under 20 players. I wandered around for 5 minutes without fighting on Wake Island with 16 people.   Invasion is much better however. These games are focused for both sides by creating a series of obstacles that one team must overcome in order to win. I really like this style of multiplayer and believe it has a ton of potential if done right. The fact that I don't particularly like the feel of the weapons in Pacific Assault is the only real reason that I'm not completely excited about this. Maps seem interesting enough with some parts more difficult for the attackers and other more difficult for the defenders. The mix is interesting enough that fans of the weapons and play style should enjoy this mode as long as the lag is under control.    Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault is not my favorite Medal of Honor game to date. There are some great ideas here along with a few very intensely entertaining moments and situations. I really wish they had been able to space out the many, linear jungle battles with more interesting engagements in larger open areas and more men where the AI actually managed to engage the enemy successfully in order for these battles to feel more realistic.If there had been more variation on mission type, enemy AI hadn't cheated, and the feel of the weapons had been more solid, the gameplay could have lived up the awesome presentation value that the rest of the package promised. As it is, Pacific Assault is a decent game, but not something I would recommend to all FPS players.", "date": "Nov 5, 2004"}
