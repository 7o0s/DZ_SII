From first-person shooters to real time strategy games, the oftentimes hasty development processes for lower budget titles is clearly manifested as one engages the gamut of budget gaming.  No Surrender:  Battle of the Bulge is one of those lackluster titles.  While there exist the occasional gems in the $20-$30 range, No Surrender simply falls short in setting itself apart from the virtually countless WW2 RTSs on store shelves.  Interestingly enough, No Surrender is only available for purchase online, for a mere $20.  While the publishers likely saved a great deal on production and distribution, there unfortunately was no diversion of resources to make the overall gameplay experience more enjoyable.  The game is only truly unique in its concentration on a brief period during the last throes of the Nazi regime, transpiring during the final 9-10 months of the war.  Despite the narrow focus, the developers at Intex brought very little to the table, and there are far better World War II experiences available on the PC.   The tutorial does an acceptable job easing players into the somewhat ineffectual interface, but does little in the way of teaching tactics or overall strategy.  Due to the huge number of units that must sometimes be controlled simultaneously, it becomes imperative to utilize the unit command queue in order to successfully launch and repel enemy attacks.  While this is handled well, it is sometimes necessary to break the queue in order to counteract the AI's terrible path-finding.  It is incredibly frustrating when you are trying to launch a surprise attack, and your troops decide it's best to go after Hitler's mustache on their own, traipsing through the forest, while your armor continues along the roadway.  Ironically, there was a situation where an inadvertent straying from the path by a platoon of soldiers created a perfect diversion, and the Panzers were able to swiftly dispatch the Churchill tanks.    Once players become more accustomed to the interface, the game becomes slightly more enjoyable.  Large-scale skirmishes are incredibly satisfying, as a maelstrom of destruction descends upon snowy terrain.  Wellsometimes snowy.  The graphics are absolutely horrendous up-close.  On most maps, there isn't even any ground, simply black space.  This really gives the feel of a ~development in progress~ type of affair, and detracts from the immersion.  Further, the textures are incredibly low-detail and would barely pass as acceptable in the industry half a decade ago.  To accompany the textures are shoddy animations that appear to only have 5-10 frames of movement.  This is unfortunate, since the game runs quite smoothly at 1280x1024.  To make matters even worse, destroyed enemy units will sometimes simply disappear into thin air.  This actually detracts from the gameplay, because enemy trucks and tanks that have been destroyed can be used as cover - but not if they have evaporated.  Graphical glitches run rampant, often amongst the game's particle and shadow effects.  While eye-candy is not necessarily integral to the success and enjoyment of a game, it is grossly difficult to employ sound strategy when the graphics themselves act as an impediment.   Being a real-time strategy game, one would expect that a solid strategic mindset would at least partially contribute to victory.  This is oftentimes the case, as battlefield tactics such as flanking and diversion are easy enough to implement.  However, due to the many glitches in the game, even the most strategy-minded player will be overcome with frustration.  There is no shroud of war, so enemies will appear and disappear at random.  This becomes problematic when you've sent a small scouting party into a full-frontal assault on a platoon of Panzers.  Thankfully there is always the option of pausing the game and taking a gander at the (likely) slaughter of your troops, and reassessing a better attack plan.    If the player can tolerate some of the blatant shortcomings of the game, there still remains enough content for appreciation.  The developers spent a great deal of time underscoring historical detail and accuracy; historians and nitpickers alike will find plenty of relevant detail to appreciate.  As a World War II buff myself, I found the narrative and play-by-play of each mission to be both accurate and informative.     With over 85 units to command, the battles can sometimes be quite varied and entertaining.  There is a bounty of options for cover, attacks, flanking etc.  Units gain special abilities when fortified in buildings or vehicles, adding to overall strategy.  For example, while fortifying a crossroads, it is beneficial to have units posted in buildings that would force incoming enemy units in a crossfire.     There are twenty missions spread across three campaigns, including Normandy, the German counter-offensive in the Ardennes at the Battle of the Bulge, and the battle of Nordwind, the German counter-offensive in the Alsace region.  What is frustrating about these campaigns is that the player is never allowed to determine which side he or she will be fighting for.  There will be no historical revisionism here.  No repulsion of the Allied landings into the English Channel.  No German victory at Bastogne.  Instead, players begin each mission and are alerted as to which side they're fighting for only by glancing at the units on screen.  It feels like ~history is playing you~ in a way, and the players are simply going through all the motions.   The sound effects are generally acceptable, but the mediocre voice acting and repetitive soundtrack mar the overall experience.  The sound bites, such as ~Lousy Kraut~ are repeated ad nauseam against a 2-minute loop of epic battle music.  The sounds of rifles, mortars, MG-42s and 88s fit the bill, but unfortunately add little to the already faltering atmosphere of the game.    The game boasts ten multiplayer maps for skirmishes online - yet there were no opponents to be found, at any time of day.  This was disappointing, as it would have been interesting to see how human players would have reacted to and overcome the various flaws with the gameplay.It's just so incredibly disappointing engaging in games which offer nothing new to the genre, or very little in the way of immersive gameplay.  While the market is fairly saturated with RTS titles, this is still no excuse for the developers not to at least make a reasonable effort at making their product stand out amongst the rest.  It is quite difficult to recommend No Surrender even with its extremely modest price tag of $20.  Though twice as expensive, a far more exhilarating and satisfying experience can be had with Relic's Company of Heroes.  It also does not bode well for advocates of the game when Ubisoft itself doesn't have the game available for download on its official site.", "date": "Jul 20, 2007"}
