{"name": "Cool Cool Toon", "name_review": "Cool Cool Toon (Import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/08/19/cool-cool-toon-import", "text": "A few days ago, I was talking to one of my American publisher buddies about SNK's Cool Cool Toon. ~It's great!~ I said. ~You've got these two cool, identifiable lead characters, and they team up with a talking bunny rabbit to dance against werewolves and zombies.~  ~I don't get it,~ replied my friend. ~What do you kill?~  Sigh. That's the attitude that ninety-nine percent of American publishing houses have taken towards musical puzzle games. They just don't get it -- and to be honest, there's no reason that they should, since the ugly truth is that the majority of that stuff just doesn't sell. There's a reason that Vib Ribbon won't be popping up on American shores: though the vocal Internet minority loves this stuff, that's precisely what they are -- a minority. Whenever most publishers get a letter demanding the release of Fruity Japanese Musical Game X, they usually laugh and chuck it the paper shredder. Or burn it. Or both. In any case, that means the chances of SNK's Cool Cool Toon getting released in America is about the same as a repentant EA announcing a new Saturn lineup. But fear not, importers -- after all, we've got our import-savvy Gamesharks now, don't we? Cool Cool Toon is SNK's final Dreamcast game, bidding a fond farewell to a wonderful system that the Japanese just didn't give two rolls of sushi. Fortunately, SNK's going-away present is a welcome change from the expected 2D King of Fighters series that's been the company's staple: COOL COOL TOONis an ~Interactive Rhythm Comic,~ and it's fruity as all get-out. Cool Cool Toon allows you to select a male or female protagonist. Amp is a freckled young lad with bright red hair and an attitu-- wait, we're not allowed to use that word any more (but do notice that his headphones are emblazoned with the words ~SUPER FLY~). Spica is a nine-year-old Spice Girl, whose gravity-defying pigtails threaten to crush her under their massive weight. One sunny day, both of them are watching television, but grow weary of what's on (all SNK footage, if you look closely). Suddenly, their TV goes on the fritz, and a pink bunny rabbit emerges, sucking them into the wild 'n wacky world of Cool Cool Town. The rabbit introduces himself as Yusa, and immediately launches into the first of the game's dance sequences, or ~Flitzes.~  A typical flitz lasts the length of a three-minute song, and requires you to manipulate your analog pad and press buttons in sequence. Here's how the game's dancing system works: a transparent circle is overlaid on top of the action. White ovals slowly close in on button icons around the diameter of the circle -- when they turn white, you hit the corresponding key. This isn't as tricky as it sounds, since everything nicely corresponds with the beat. In certain instances, you're required to make a circular motion with the pad, similar to the spray painting movements of Jet Set Radio. This takes a bit more practice, but can be mastered after a few attempts.  As the story progresses, you meet -- and flitz -- with a number of characters, who are clearly some of the most imaginative guys and gals to emerge from SNK's stable. There's Kemio, the psychotically-grinning Aryan dance machine, who has the slight disadvantage of turning into a werewolf with a distinct yakuza accent. You'll also meet up with Dr. Stein and his shapely monster sidekick Ranken (note: the Japanese do not necessarily see this as a bad pun), and an evil-looking Eval, who resembles a streamlined Reala from NiGHTS. Best of all, you'll meet different rivals during the game, depending on whether you pick Amp or Spica as your main compadre.  Both Amp and Spica work their way through five episodes, which are broken down into three flitzes each. The first two flitzes are usually rehearsal numbers, while the final flitz adds in a vocal track and beefier accompaniment. Occasionally, the game will throw in a PaRappa-style stage, where you have to play back a certain sequence of notes with the control pad. I laughed my durn fool ass off during episode three, where you have to dance against a vaguely Kirby-ish time bomb and keep him from exploding. Cool Cool Toon brings the whole package together in a coherent and expertly-paced fashion, providing cut-scene breaks and other  diversions so you can catch your breath. In-between episodes, you return to Yusa's enormous bunny-shaped house, where you can save your game, watch successful flitzes, learn the gameplay system, or examine your wardrobe. That's right - once you complete a flitz, you earn points, which can be traded in for new clothes at the shopping mall. I haven't seen them all yet, but some are exclusively available through the Cool Cool Toon Internet home page, and are truly pimped-out.  As you'd expect from SNK, the game looks wonderful, running at a rock-solid 60fps with detail-packed backgrounds. There are plenty of bright colors and undulating dancing doohickeys in each stage, and it looks like a cool, cool.... toon. Funny, that. The motion capture is also some of the best I've ever seen, and the dance moves are nothing short of electric. The animators have done a nice job making both the stubby and the realistic-proportioned characters move convincingly in the cutscenes, too, and it's nice to see that SNK has a decent grip on 3D (anyone remember Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition? Yeegh).  And musically, COOL COOL TOON's not bad a'tall. The game's sound is light, fluffy, and J-poppy -- think of Shorty's saccharine-injected stage in Bust a Move and you'll get the picture. Most of the music is generated by the DC's synthesizer chip, and I think I heard a bit of 'lag' in-between the vocal chunks of one song -- nevertheless, it's pretty tight. We'll be keeping our eyes peeled for the original soundtrack once it hits the stands.  The only major fault of COOL COOL TOON is its length -- the game is pretty much over after five episodes. However, there's a Versus Flitz mode where you can take on a buddy, and select from around 20 unlockable characters. There's also a Single Flitz mode, where you can completely forego the Yusa's-house interface and just cut the rug. Lastly, the game can interface with Cool Cool Jam on the Neo Geo Pocket Color for data exchange  though we haven't had the opportunity to jack our NGPCs into our DCs at this point.  So is COOL COOL TOON worth the import? If you're into Japanese-style dancing action games, yes, absolutely. The game is  packed to the brim with cool characters, great animation, and solid beats. Though some of the mini-games can be confusing without knowledge of basic Japanese, they shouldn't provide much of a hurdle -- and to be honest, the Japanese used in the game is very basic. Considering this one probably won't see the light of day in the US for the rest of eternity, music-game fruits should take a serious look at Amp, Spica, and the rest of the Cool Cool crew. -- Colin ~Donnie Wahlberg~ Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "Aug 19, 2000"}
