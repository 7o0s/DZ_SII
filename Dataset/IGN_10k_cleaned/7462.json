Between my carjackings, thefts, assaults, and murders (oh, the murders!), my entire virtual criminal record is going to catch up to me, when the fictional police of [insert your favorite urban chaos game here] bust out of the TV and start beating the crap out of me in reality. Before that happens, however, I fear that the digital animal protection agency will come after me with tasers and subpoenas. Because, I have to admit, I have few greater joys than hurting a cute bundle of fluff that unfortunately walked in my screen.    Oh yes, I have a long history of abuse. My poor old Tamagotchis suffered as I refused to feed them and left their poop in their rooms. I burned down the woods in SimCity 4 so all the wildlife would contribute to the largest Bar-B-Que in history. I even pimped out my daughter to the devil himself in Princess Maker 2 okay, so that's not technically a ~pet,~ but who cares. Let's not even discuss my numerous forays into the world of Monster Rancher 4.   And now, the tradition continues with The Sims 2: Pets, which on paper adds all the functionality of the Unleashed expansion for the original series, and gives me something new to torture. I left my mark on that one by obliterating Tester the Cat in at least a dozen different ways, so I looked forward to seeing what kind of mayhem I could unleash (get it? HA!!!) on the new one.   First, a little history lesson The Sims series has always featured the sociable nature of people at its forefront. When the original game hit the shelves almost seven years ago, one of the problems for new players was creating enough Sims to give your primary family enough friends to get promoted. Or if, God forbid, you created a single Sim, you'd pretty much be fighting from the beginning to keep that social meter of his anything but in the basement.    With the Townies that were created in The Sims 1: Hot Date, and the fact that Townies have always been around The Sims 2, that problem is pretty much gone. Any Sim can reach out and touch someone to give the all-important social meter a kick in the pants. If pets were mainly social creatures, but there is no longer any shortage of social situations, what then is the point of the pets?   Luckily, Electronic Arts did itself somewhat proudly as always, and managed to integrate pets into the world without being too redundant. Pets serve a non-vital role in your Sims' lives, but they can augment many facets to ease your stress. There is the aforementioned social aspect especially, where a single Sim can have a pet and be extremely well off, using the pet as an emergency boost to the social meter (arguably the hardest one to raise). Your Sims always have enough problems; one fewer is always appreciated.   Beyond that, your pets can be used to further your bank account. Cats and dogs can now have jobs, although not nearly to the extent of humans. There's no special reward for reaching a particular level, and you won't be breaking the bank account no matter how many pets you have working for you. Still, any money is better than none, and in those first ten days or so of your new family's life, it can be a more-than-adequate boost to your income.   A better option if you're getting pets for financial security is to sell them. Pets can be trained in a variety of commands, each one adding to the pet's value. When you think it's time to pull the trigger on a sale, you can try pawning it off on another Sim a fully trained, fully obedient animal could be worth several thousand, although it's arguable whether the effort is worth the price tag.   As always, it seems that the expansions are best used in tandem. If you have a Servo from Open for Business, you'll have the added benefit of having someone around to teach a pet every waking moment. Also, having Open for Business lets your Sims run pet shops, which is just one more avenue to open the game to some creativity and fun. Never a bad thing.   Oh, of note in our review for Open for Business, we mentioned that Servo had this really bad habit of serving up food randomly. That seems to have been patched, or his programming altered, or whatever you want to call it the point is, he behaves much better, and has less free will of his own. It's subtle, but if you have a Servo already, he'll be in the way far less.   Back to the pets the cats and dogs are very fleshed out in this expansion, unlike they were in the old Unleashed expansion. Pets' appearances are not limited to a few select breeds. In fact, you can easily create your own breeds by using the coloring ~layers,~ a concept that should be familiar to anyone who's ever used Photoshop.    For example, you could start with a cat with a white coat. Top it off with black paws in the front, green paws in the back, one green eye, one yellow eye, a silver tail, and random spots of red and pink. In addition to making one ugly beast, you can save it to be bought and copied many times over. That doesn't even include all the head shapes, snout shapes, ear sizes, tail fluffiness, and more that you can alter to customize your breed. When you have something you really like, you can export it as a file and share it all over the Internet.   When two pets mate, like human Sims, their DNA will mix and match, and may wind up with new breeds that aren't actually terrible to look at. You can ~register~ the new breed with the SimCity Animal Agency, and you'll be able to buy those too at will. It's all very cool, streamlined, and overall just much better handled than it was back in Unleashed.    Speaking of DNA, pets have their own personalities and ratings, although those are a simplified version of their human counterparts. Pets can be trained not just in commands, but also in behaviors, to the point where you can train them to pee all over your living room floor and then roll around in it. Nasty, yes but extremely amusing.   Like Unleashed before it, Sims 2: Pets includes a few pets that pretty much have no function other than to look cute and up the environment scores. I call these ~Low-Maintenance Pets,~ the hamsters and birds of the group, as opposed to the ~High Maintenance~ dogs and cats. Hey, you get what you pay for: the birds are cheap and help Environment ratings, but otherwise they just eat up your time as you feed them every day.   Meanwhile, a couple of things were added to the humans' lives as well. Most importantly is the presence of a werewolf, who can in turn make your Sims suffer from lycanthropy. Unlike vampires from The Sims 2: Nightlife, being a werewolf doesn't quite have the same game-changing impact. I suppose it's nice to see yet another goofy addition to the world, but it feels a little tacked on.   Also included with the expansion pack are various tools that allegedly make your game easier to deal with. They run the gamut from worthless to unnecessary, such as the sledgehammer in Build and Buy modes, which does nothing but essentially sell whatever object or wall you click on. This saves you about two clicks of a mouse, not exactly something that makes life simpler.    Pretty much the only tool that was added with any value is the diagonal roof tool, allowing you to finally make roofs for your cut-cornered rooms without having to resort to either flat roofs or slightly off roofs. It sounds small, but there are plenty of gamers out there who get more into the building aspect of the game than the living part, so it's pretty useful for budding architects.   Outside of that, you can add pictures to your Sims directory and have your own Sims paint them within the game. This way you can have a Sim paint the logo of your favorite sports team, for example, to hang in the bedroom. Small detail, but pretty neat.   All is not peaches and gravy here in Pets, however. Sure, the pets are extremely well done and the options for breeds and colorings are basically limitless. However, all the usual things we expect from the expansion pack are not here. There are no new clothes at all, very few new objects (of which all revolve around the pets), and no new external area for Sims to visit.   Although the pets are cool and useful enough, there's just not enough you can do with them. Unleashed even had pet competitions; what happened to those? Pet toys and collars are very few in number, and once a pet is fully trained, it really doesn't serve any purpose other than to be sold. Basically, while pets have their usefulness for new families and single Sims, the novelty and functionality wear off pretty quickly.I always mentally grade Sims expansions (of which this #11 in the whole series, and #4 of the Sims 2 series) based on their usefulness. When it comes down to it, Pets is hands-down the least significant and useful of the Sims 2 expansion packs.That's not to say it's bad; it's really not. But the lack of clothing options for human Sims and the lack of new, non-pet-related objects really hurts. As great as pets are in the short-term, they aren't and never have been the draw of the game. You'll be spending more time with your human Sims than your pets, so why must the entire expansion be geared toward the four-legged creatures?If you're a Sims 2 fan and have no expansions, grab Nightlife first. Conversely, if you're a big enough Sims fan to own all the expansions so far, go ahead and drop the money on this one as well. This expansion, in a nutshell, is definitely made for the Sims 2 fans, not the Sims 2 newbies.", "date": "Oct 27, 2006"}
