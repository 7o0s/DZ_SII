It's not that I hate writing, or that I hate my job, it's just not fun to write about boring expansion packs that add little substance to a stagnating series of games. Sadly enough, that's exactly what we have in the second expansion to Roller Coaster Tycoon 2. It adds plenty of content as far as objects go, but adds little to nothing to improve upon any of the game. The 20 dollar price tag makes that a bit easier to swallow, but only the crazy park creators are really going to dig what's inside this box.    Let's re-cap what we know so far about Roller Coaster Tycoon. The original was released back in 1999 to praise from both critics and consumers. This was a happy side dish to go along with the millions of copies sold. As was expected, a couple of expansions were released that added new content and material, but weren't anything incredibly invigorating. Finally, after years of waiting, Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 was released to a very underwhelmed crowd.  What should have been a great sequel turned out to be look more like what should have been the great expansion pack to the original Roller Coaster Tycoon. But who cares about adding a ton of new things? Who cares about creating an entirely new engine with a tiny share of the profits from the first game. Who cares about refining the gameplay? None of that seemed to matter. And maybe they were right because the game ended up on the top sellers list regardless of its mediocre attempt at newness. So it was also no surprise when the expansions started arriving to capitalize on the momentum. The first of these expansions, Wacky Worlds, was anything but wacky even if it did have to do with different parts of the world. It offered very little that was new aside from more scenery and scenarios. It was a bit of a disappointment.   That brings us to the present expansion called Time Twister, which takes RCT fans on a ride through the swirling gray madness of time by adding even more scenarios and scenery themed to fit with different periods of history. As you would imagine, each of these time periods gets it's own selection of new scenery and special rides (which basically means the kind of cars), but this is all stuff we've seen before, even if it looks mostly different. There is nothing in this expansion that will change the way the game plays. There is nothing in the expansion that will excite anyone except for the hardcore gamers that need something new to spruce up their superparks.   I've made a lot of fun of The Sims over the years, both because I think it's a silly game (even if I was addicted at first) and because of the billion expansion packs released for it. But at least most of these expansions tried to expand on the gameplay of the title and not just textures and graphics. Sure, it did a lot of that, but parties changed gameplay, pets changed gameplay, and magic most definitely changed gameplay. So while I might not be The Sims' biggest promoter, I also appreciated that they at least tried to do something new each time. Roller Coaster Tycoon has not. Time Twister is just the most recent casualty of this campaign of mediocrity.   So if there isn't any new gameplay, there must be something added, right? Yes. That is most definitely true. There are a couple of new scenarios for each period of history, a couple of which are interesting and one of which allows you to build a park without restriction of time or money, but for the most part, we've seen these all before. Make your park popular. Make sure it has a good rating. Make sure people are happy. Make sure it makes a certain amount of money at a certain time. Blah, blah, blah. I've played nearly all of these scenarios in the past. The only difference is the layout of the level and the scenery therein. One of the scenarios challenged players to build six roller coasters across a rather large valley, which was actually interesting for a couple of reasons, but even that had been done in previous scenarios, if on a smaller scale.   Each of these time periods, which range from the Dark Ages and Mythological Times (The Classics) to the Roaring Twenties and into the Future, also bring their own sets of scenery. Prehistoric times will give players plenty of dinosaurs and fossil types of additions while the Roaring Twenties will not only bring gigantic animatronic gangsters, cops, and band players, but also plenty of pieces for brick houses complete with fire escapes and all. In fact, all of the periods bring new stuff to the mix, even if some of them, like the Dark Ages, look quite like some of the old scenery. At least the Future looks different with the glowing walkways, even if they're distractingly busy with moving lights and colors.Here's the deal. Roller Coaster Tycoon 2: Time Twister is not very good. It adds virtually nothing to the experience that will make RCT2 more fun or more appealing to the casual gamer. The only people that will really benefit from this expansion are the hardcore theme park designers that need new themes to make even more parks, and even then it seems like a hard sell to me. I was horrifically addicted to RCT when it was originally released. I hope you can believe me when I say that I'll be at the front of the queue when a new and improved Roller Coaster Tycoon comes out. But I'm sure as hell not going to stand in line for an expansion that is about as new and exciting as a broken down merry-go-round.", "date": "Dec 16, 2003"}
