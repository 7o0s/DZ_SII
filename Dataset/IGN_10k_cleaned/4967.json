For this time around, Activision has put its two cents in with the Sand Grain Studios-developed Rapala's Pro Fishing. And from the offset, this latest entry has more of an arcade feel, with a simplistic layout perfect for beginning fisherman. The game features fully licensed Rapala fishing gear and tips from its ~pro-staff~ as well.   There are two modes of game play for fishermen to choose from, free fishing and tournament fishing. Tournament gives gamers a time limit to catch more and larger fish than other fishermen, while playing in both modes; new equipment will become unlocked for accomplishing various goals. It would be nice if the goals for unlocking gear were outlined so that gamers have something specific to work for, but objectives like catching a two-pound crappie or reeling five Walleyes in two minutes, are things that we have to guess to do on our own. Which is really too bad, as this kind of care really would have added some dimension to the game while giving encouragement to spend more time in the free fish mode.     Rapala's mechanics are similar to most fishing video games, and truthfully, they aren't much more advanced than the Harvest Moon mini-games. The whole approach is rather simple: find a decent fishing spot in a boat, select the correct equipment, and cast a line. There are two options for casting, an easy cast and the more realistic manual cast, but with easy cast turned on, players simply select the area of water they would like to cast into and press the reel release button. Normal casting requires a little more skill. The rod is controlled with the analogue stick and the release button has to be pressed at the correct point of the cast. This technique is easy to get the hang of and after a few 8-foot attempts I was easily launching my lures across the lake. Fortunately, in either mode there is no risk of casting into your friend's face or becoming so tangled in your line that a pair of lawn sheers are needed to free you. Both of these real life situations plague every one of my fishing trips.    Click For More Images There are a few onscreen indicators that are used to fine-tune your fishing technique too. In the bottom right hand corner of the screen there are drag settings and the lure depth. Once the lure is in the water the camera switches from a third person perspective that hovers over your boat to an underwater perspective of the lure that can be adjusted with the d-pad. This provides an up close view of how the lure is moving in the water. There is also a small model of your character in the corner of the screen to remind players how their movements with the analogue effects rod movement.   The camera briefly points out any fish that are approaching the lure and proceeds to focus in on the bite. Once you get a bite, the camera switches back to the third person, behind the boat perspective. Hooking the fish simply involves pulling back on the rod and it is now time to reel that sucker in. This is the meat and potatoes of any fishing game, the age-old struggle to balance reeling speed with line tension. There is a tension bar similar to every other tension indicator used in a fishing video game. If the fish starts jumping out of the water or fighting in a certain direction, players must accommodate its movements by moving the rod. If you leave too much slack, the fish will throw the hook and if you ignore high tension your line will snap.   Throughout the game your fishing buddy will offer helpful comments on the situation and your choice of equipment. This can be incredibly helpful in situations, which require minor adjustments. For example, in Florida I was positive that I was using the correct lure but I wasn't attracting any bites. My fishing buddy pointed out that I hadn't made the best choice of color for my lure. I experimented with the color options and lo and behold, I began to real them in like a pro.    Pro Fishing suffers from the same problems as other niche sports games such as the popular Cabela's Deer Hunter series. No matter how much detail is provided about the sport, the actual game play is very limited. Once gamers have mastered casting and reeling in the big fish there isn't a whole lot more to the game. Additional strategy is added by choosing the right type of equipment, but matching the correct lure, line, and rod with the type of fish is simple, especially with previous knowledge of the sport. Even if fishing is a foreign activity to you there are enough in game tips that the whole of the game can be mastered in a few hours.     On the positive side, the menu interface is sleek and user friendly with detailed information on all of the equipment, fish, and locations. Rapala also sports some visuals that are attractive if not impressive. There are some pretty underwater sunlight effects and droplets of water kicked up by the boat stick to the screen for a short time. (You may remember this effect from Quantum Redshift.) The most visually impressive part of the game takes place below the waterline. The fish are much better looking than the character models and the water swims with algae and aquatic plant life. There isn't a lot of material to discuss in terms of animation. Characters cast their line and various fish swim towards the lure. Overall, the experience feels very generic. Fishing games are not known for their super high production values and this game certainly doesn't break the trend.    Pro Fishing Challenge by Atlus reallt raised the bar in terms of online features with voice support and online multiplayer that supported up to eight people. Rapala advertises online capabilities, but the game's only online feature is a scoreboard. Fishing isn't a sport that is conducive to multiplayer elements, but it would have been nice to see some creative online options such as a casting contest, or the style of tournament that takes place in the one player game.   Click For More Images Back when the Dreamcast was the latest and greatest piece of hardware, SEGA proved that fishing games could be addictive enough to hit a mainstream audience and it feels like fishing games have been going backwards ever since. Rapala Pro Fishing is an average game at best and it doesnt offer any compelling reasons to pick it over the competition.Even at thirty dollars, you may want to pick this one up after a price drop or give it a test run as a rental before purchasing it. However, if you must have a fishing game and you are turned off by the technical aspects Atlus Pro Fishing Challenge then the accessibility and fairly simple game play of Pro Fishing is a decent fallback.", "date": "Sep 10, 2004"}
