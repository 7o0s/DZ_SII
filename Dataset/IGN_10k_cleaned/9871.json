{"name": "BurgerTime Delight", "name_review": "Burgertime Special Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/17/burgertime-special-review", "text": "Burgertime Delight is the second remixed appearance of the arcade classic, following Hudson's Burgertime Special from last year. Namco's Burgertime Delight updates the game a variety of new features, from new graphics to environmental hazards that complicate the cooking process even more than just avoiding that pesky fried egg.   The core of Burgertime is intact in Delight. Chef Peter Pepper still trundles about the multi-tiered mazes, shuffling over burger ingredients. Pepper must send the burger parts cascading to the bottom of the screen while avoiding enemy foodstuffs in order to move on to the next stage. Pepper's only defense against the angry mob is a few shakes of pepper. Each cloud of pepper temporarily freezes the foe, allowing Pepper to either run away or dispatch the enemy by dropping burger parts on it or walking the condiment out from underneath of it.   The Delight updates add a cool wrinkle to the game. The new enemies, like Mr. Carrot, are welcome additions to the murder's row of enemy foods. But the new environmental hazards are the biggest change  and they really add a lot of challenge to the game. Depending on where you are in the kitchen (oven, freezer, etc.), hazards like flame bursts or icicles threaten to knock Pepper off of the maze.   Namco also added a spelling element straight out of classics like Mr. Do and Mappy. Pepper must walk over letters to assemble words like ~burger~ to earn bonuses like extra lives.  If you like the original Burgertime, there is absolutely no reason outside of self-delusion that will keep you from enjoying Burgertime Delight. The enhancements only augment the original game and the new look is pleasing. Since I love me some Burgertime, I have every intention of downloading Delight to my personal phone  and thats about as big of an endorsement I can give.", "date": "Jan 17, 2008"}
