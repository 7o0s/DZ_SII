Nike sponsored him and created an ad campaign complete with extreme website in his honor. Apparently, he also received enough cash to startup a skiing game with his name slapped on it.   Sadly, only those who strive to deepen the disappointment they felt watching Bode have a meltdown on the Torino slopes should pick that game up. If you want to wallow in the pain, however, then Bode Miller Alpine Skiing is your pit of despair.   With dumbed-down gameplay and graphics that make every mountain look the same, it's apparent from the first run that this was a rush job. The only real skill is in leaning left or right and getting a decent sense of rhythm. You can tuck by holding the X button, but the pose of the skier doesn't change. The square button is for digging in for tighter turns and the circle is the mysterious jump button. These skiers can even jump while going uphill. It's amazing stuff.    Saying that the only skill is in leaning left or right may sound obvious, but without analog control of tucking for better speed there's not as much of a feeling of control. For the most part, you can easily pick up the skills needed to become a skiing superstar and that's the big problem here. The excitement never really builds and instead the game quickly locks into a boring groove with no motivation. The mountains never get more interesting and what the game offers in the very beginning is all it ever is.   If the skiing itself wasn't boring and tiresome enough, many other parts are lifeless as well. The commentators barely have anything to say about the performance and whenever they do it does nothing to help. Miss a gate and hear, ~Oh, that'll be a penalty.~ Thank you, Captain Obvious, now where the hell did I put my mute button? Oh wait, that must've only applied to the music which isn't here to begin with.   The only area where Bode Miller Alpine Skiing shows any creativity or inspiration is in the photos and descriptions of the coaches and waxers you can hire to train you to wax your skis. With photos of men that look like they'd just been given a wedgie and wacky details of their skills, if they have any, it's a funny distraction. But when you stop to notice just how good a description of a waxer is it's a pretty good sign that this game has no hope for it. Seriously, this is the best part of the whole game.The only relation to exciting skiing is that Bode Miller's name has been slapped on the cover. How realistic can it be when you can't ski off the course halfway through and still make killer money from endorsements? How much can you care when every race feels like a demo to a game still in progress? If there was ever a shameless ploy for money, this is it. Ignore it and wait for a better title.", "date": "Mar 1, 2006"}
