Schizm is not for the average gamer.  Some kind of walkthrough is necessary to complete this ridiculously hard game.  Even though this is by far the most graphically pleasing game I've put my hands on recently, it lacks substance in the most extreme ways.  The storyline is disappointing, the ending pathetic and the puzzles too difficult to be considered fun.  Several months prior to the protagonists' arrival, the planet Argilus was discovered completely abandoned.  It appeared that the inhabitants disappeared just before the arrival of the exploring party, as evidenced by freshly prepared food and unlocked doors.  The planet was quarantined and scientists were sent to discover what happened to the Argilans.  Radio contact was lost because of some kind of interference.  Then, it appears, that the researchers started disappearing.  Flash forward to the present, Sam and Hannah arrive to resupply the researchers.  Upon arriving at Argilus, they attempt contact with those who are supposed to be on the planet's surface, but receive no response.  Moving their ship closer to the planet, they still cannot communicate with anyone.  Doing what protocol requires, Sam and Hannah prepare to withdraw and contact Earth, but instead are pulled down onto the planet when their ships' main systems fail.  Sam and Hannah are forced to abandon the ship.  They enter the life-pods and descend to the planet, planning to meet at Base One.  However, both are thrown off course.  Hannah touches down on a beautiful living colony of ships in the middle of an Ocean.  Sam arrives on a group of hot air balloons floating in the sky.  At first, neither can contact the other.  Eventually, they are able to communicate through their radios, but for some strange reason, they cannot see the other.  Switching between Hannah and Sam, the player explores several exquisite and detailed locations.  The game is relatively non-linear and players are free to explore Argilus at their own pace.  And explore they will, as they keep returning to location after location trying to discover some logic to the path of the story.  Eventually, it is revealed that something or someone called Matia is involved.  But what is Matia?  Moving through Schizm the player will encounter many theories, but in reality, has no impact on any of them.  One failing I felt this game had is that I really didn't care about the characters or what Matia is.  The puzzles are incredibly difficult that I fear even a rocket scientist would fail to understand.  Puzzles commonly include symbols or sounds of the language of the planet, but what needs to be done with these symbols or sounds is a complete mystery.  In one particularly baffling puzzle, there is a drawing of a triangle with some symbols scrawled on the wall.  These symbols apparently represent some kind of equation.  The numbers that need to be plugged into the equation are extremely vague however.  It turns out there are 5 pillars in another location which have to be measured with an odd machine and those measurements are plugged into an equation, resulting in the answer to the puzzle.  Yes, the description of this puzzle is confusing.  Perhaps I'm getting across even an itsy amount of the frustration the puzzles in this game present.  Throughout the game, there are cut-scenes, but they are usually clues to what needs to be done.  Also, travel between two locations is in the form of a cut-scene and I could figure no way to fast forward through these.  The ending is ridiculous.  All those puzzles to labor over and the endless searching for what needs to be completed next, and the only reward is an ending not suited for even a child's game.  The disappointing story concludes, as might be expected, disappointingly.  The interface is somewhat easy to understand.  Schizm can be played entirely with the mouse.  Holding down the left-click button will allow the player to scroll around to explore their environment.  The game is first person and has 360 degree panning capabilities.  While looking up and down is somewhat limited, players can scroll completely around the scene they are in.  Almost no objects are interactive and only a handful of items can actually be placed into a player's inventory.  In the bottom left hand corner is an icon that lets the player know in what directions movement can be made, taking the guesswork out of which paths can be explored.  The graphics in Schizm are truly incredible.  From the beautiful skylines to the exquisitely designed buildings, great care was put into every artistic detail.  My breath was indeed taken away multiple times while playing through this title.  The sounds are very well done as well, never getting annoying.  The voice acting is believable and a wide variety of accented individuals are enjoyable.  There were times, however, that the sound was a problem.  Certain puzzles require familiarity with sounds.  Some of these sounds, however, which is the language of Argilus, are not understandable.  They sound like gibberish and making out the individual sounds is very hard.  Other than this minor sound flaw that can be overcome with the walkthrough or a lot of guesswork, the sound and graphics in this game are near perfect.  Unfortunately, a pretty package doesn't make up for the empty box found inside.  Schizm is probably the worst adventure game I've ever played.  Sure, I want a challenge, but Schizm is unplayable without a walkthrough.  The storyline isn't even very good.  The ending is horrible, especially considering the amount of pain that is involved in playing this game all the way to the end.  Unless you are a true glutton for punishment or don't care about endings and don't mind using a walkthrough to play a sub-par game, this is a definite pass.  -- Staci Krause Want to share your opinions with the world?
