A thoroughly addicting puzzle game it probably could have benefited from some more fine-tuning and yet like all addicting substances you keep going back for more punishment. I can see the president of Infogrames sitting before Congress, ala the Tobacco company presidents, and solemnly swearing ~I believe that Ballistic is non addictive.~ This game is a pain; and I mean that as a compliment! Ballistic is the latest arcade puzzle crazy in Japan where it is known as Time loop. Not content to impact productivity in Japan, the title is now being brought to the US by Infogrames.  Gameplay Play revolves around a very simple concept. A chain of colored balls moves constantly on a spiral track toward the center of the screen. Once the balls reach that center the game is over and the player's goal is to prolong the inevitable. This is done by aiming a rotating turret and shooting one of your own colored balls into the chain as a segment of the chain is eliminated when it contains three or more connected balls of the same color. It sounds relatively simple but doing just that will lead to a quick loss.   Multiple reactions must be planned by seeding chains with balls so that when for example, three yellow balls are eliminated, two groups of two purple balls on either side of the yellow balls come together to form their own three-plus chain and are therefore also eliminated. With careful planning it is possible to set up chain reactions that cause many chains to disappear.   While presented differently this is the same basic mechanic that powers such games as Tetris, i.e. connect the various patterns to eliminate some of the puzzle and give yourself more time.  Three modes of play are on offer, Panic, Stage and Vs. Panic is just one constant flow that never stops and the challenge is to see how long you can last. It's an OK challenge but the one that had me up to 3 in the morning was the Stage mode. Each stage starts off with a certain number of balls from six (very easy) on the first stage to 22 on the next and then exponentially more and more per stage. Points are awarded based on the time it takes to complete the stage.   The difficulty ramps up pretty quickly this is where my biggest complaint about Ballistic. Each level is significantly harder than the rest. That's fine in principal and there is certainly a reciprocal feeling of euphoria when you beat a level after trying for over an hour. However what would have been nice was a peaks and valleys approach where you build up to the difficulty every few stages. Therefore once you got through the very tough end stage of a grouping, there would be a couple of easier stages, possibly with a new game dynamic added, that would let you build up to the next very hard level. By maintaining the intensity of level after level, the designers have actually done a disservice to the game player as there is little incentive to keep playing immediately after completing a hard level knowing that the next one is even more so. At that point you save and go to bed, rather than taking a breather while playing.   Various bonus items are added that can aid the player such as a smart bomb that destroys all balls of the same color and a very useful clock that stops the balls moving for a certain rate of time. Most helpful as the vast horde are bearing down on the center of the spiral.   The Vs mode is reminiscent of the old Dr Mario title where a successful combination will result in more debris being deposited on your opponent's screen. Not recommended as a game to play with your spouse!  Control Quite possibly the winner for the most uncomplicated game in PlayStation history the game is literally a rotate and shoot combination. The turret responds quickly and there is virtually no lag in shooting out the balls. If you are quick enough mentally the game can handle the physical challenge. Working from the outside in, the balls move closer and it is possible to fire through a hole made by an eliminated chain to reach combinations on the outside loops.  Graphics Ballistic is a perfect example that you don't need fancy graphics to have a good game. Crisp and clean, the bright colored balls leave no ambiguity as to which color they are and there are no close color clashes.  Sound As the balls get closer to the center of the spiral they enter a danger zone. This triggers an audio response and the music becomes much more strident in nature. It's an effective way of adding to the players stress level inducing panic mistakes when controlled reasonable play will probably suffice.As I mentioned, I love and I hate this game and that is probably the hallmark of a good puzzle title. As with all successful puzzle titles the concept is very easy to pick up enabling any aged game player to play. Fans of the old Dr. Mario may well enjoy the Vs mode and that is probably the criteria for purchase. As a single player game it is a challenging and diverting rental.", "date": "Nov 3, 1999"}
