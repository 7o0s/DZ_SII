Many of those millions are children, and, further, many of those are very young children. It's not uncommon to see kids even under the age of five owning their own dual-screened system, and playing quite happily, and with great skill, games that were originally intended for players several more years older than they are.  Chances are you know a player just like that  your niece, or nephew, or even your own kids.   So recognizing that the age of entry for video games is lower now than it's ever been before, UFO Interactive has decided to publish the Smart Kids series  games aimed at kids who are very young, starting at the age of three. Smart Girl's Playhouse is the title for young girls, and, for young men, it's Smart Boy's Gameroom. The latter is what we'll focus on here, and its collection of accessible, cute, and very, very simple mini-games.    There are twelve of them, altogether, and the first positive point to address is that each of these games looks great. Visually, the simple cartoon style that is applied to each design is very accessible, and completely inoffensive  on the same level as what you'd see in a children's book meant for the same young age range. The elements that players interact with, too, are always clear and usually very large, making them easy to see.   This boy's version replaces traditional Whac-a-Mole with   And easy to touch with little fingers, which is an important point that developers Starfish must have recognized  the youngest DS players don't quite care for the stylus, and often prefer to poke the screen themselves with their index fingers or thumbs. The piano playing mini-game is most encouraging for that, as it transforms the touch screen into a small subset of a keyboard and lets players create their own music. You can save your creations and play them back, and change the sound to mimic the tones of an organ instead, or even the barks of a dog.   The dog option isn't quite as abrasive as the cat screeches found in the same mode in Smart Girl's Playhouse, which is a minor positive for the Boy's edition. But both versions do share the one other occasion when the design emits some less-than-satisfying sounds. In the Match Sounds game, players are asked to remember the correct order in which five cartoon vehicles blow their horns or rev their engines, and then repeat that sequence. Just like the classic game Simon. Except, in between touching the vehicles in the order you're trying to remember, a congratulatory bell will ring every time you get one right. That could, potentially, break up the flow of a child's memory  having to wait after every correct input for a few seconds before you're allowed to touch the next right car or boat in sequence.   Luckily, that occurrence is isolated, and the remaining games in the Gameroom package play out with few, if any, additional concerns. There's a card-matching memory game. There's a counting game, and simple jigsaw puzzler with only five or so pieces per puzzle. There's a design that lets you play instruments along with four different background songs, a Whac-a-Mole clone that's called Exterminate Monsters (while it plays a rousing rendition of Flight of the Valkyries as the background music),  and more. Each of these designs is very straightforward and easy to play  though they might lack depth for some of the boys who'd try them, and they could get bored after a while.   The deeper designs are the piano mode, mentioned earlier, and probably also the Drawing and Coloring mini-games. Drawing offers a blank canvas to scribble across, with a small set of different colors and stamps to use in creating your masterpiece. Coloring offers the same array of shades, but provides the picture for you  touching an empty region will instantly fill it completely with color, so no scribbling to fill it in yourself. Both modes will also save your creations while you play other games, so you can revisit them later  but they will be lost if you turn off the power to the system.   Finally, while Smart Boy's Gameroom is almost identical to Smart Girl's Playhouse in all of the game designs mentioned above, there are a couple of gender-specific designs included here that do differentiate the products. The Girl's version had a Dress Up mode for putting together outfits and clothing styles, and a Lunch Box mode that let little women put together virtual lunches with a variety of different Japanese foods. Both of those are gone from Smart Boy's Gameroom, though, and replaced with more boy-focused Train Station and Car Driving modes.   The Train Station design gives little guys a virtual train set to play with, as an interconnected set of tracks is presented on the touch screen while a zoomed-in view focuses on the train chugging along the line up above. You can touch several switchtrack points on the rails to alter the direction they point, and the train will change course when it comes to those intersections. You can also alter the speed of the engine from fast, to slow, to a full stop, as well as selecting from three different styles of train model  there's a bullet train, a more traditional passenger train, and an old steam engine that looks like it came straight out of the Old West.   Car Driving mode also offers three different vehicles  a police cruiser, a taxi and a kindergarten bus. It gives players a set of large arrows on the touch screen and asks them to drive around a small town to reach a destination. The police car needs to get to the station, the bus needs to get to the school. Simple and easy stuff. But also much more interesting than the Smart Girl's Playhouse Lunch Box game, which it replaces in this version. Because the lack of an American menu in that girl's design was a bit of a negative against the Playhouse edition, Gameroom is likely a slightly more appealing product overall. So it's worth noting.The youngest DS players out there are all probably playing the very same games as older gamers, even twice or three times their age. And they're likely loving every minute of it, playing Mario Kart and the like with a skill level well beyond their years. But it's encouraging, now, that a publisher has recognized the potential need for titles more appropriate for the very young. Three-year-olds should certainly be encouraged to engage themselves in activities other than video games, but if they're going to be playing anyway, or if they're already seeing their older brothers, sisters and cousins playing and they don't want to be left out, the Smart Kids titles are a safe bet for introducing them into the pastime. Smart Boy's Gameroom for boys, in particular, is a game that I'd feel safe in giving as a gift to my own nephew, or any young man who's in the age range of three to four years old. And as it's offered at a budget price, I'd recommend it to other parents, aunts or uncles who also have little guys in their lives in the same stage of life.", "date": "Dec 5, 2007"}
