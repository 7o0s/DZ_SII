I spent countless hours in front of my monitor spellbound by the little men who existed only to do my bidding. Several years later Bullfrog released Populous 2, more of an update than a sequel, that added better graphics, a few new attacks and more levels to what had been offered up by the first title. Although I was certainly happy with the improvements, I couldn't help feeling that more could have been done to improve the game itself. Now, almost a decade later, I've finally gotten a chance to play the game I'd wished for. With Populous: The Beginning, Bullfrog has not only expanded on the mechanics of godhood, but also helped to explain what got you there in the first place.  Populous: The Beginning takes place before the events of the first two games. In this title you begin as a Shaman, the mystical leader of a tribe who has realized her potential for greatness. In order to win each level, you must use your magic to help your people wipe out any others on the map. Once you've managed to gain control of all the planets in the solar system, you'll be able to focus your powers on yourself and become a god.  Gameplay is very similar to the other games in the Populous series. You use your mouse to select different members of your tribe and you order them to do your bidding. There are two major differences though, that change the entire feel of the game. First off, you now have a body to worry about. As your shaman is one of the on-screen characters, you must make sure that you are close enough to enemies to use your powers on them without getting close enough to be harmed. Although dying in the game is never permanent, on most levels killing your shaman will give your opponent enough of an edge to take the win. The other major difference in this game is the level at which you must control your workers. In the original titles, your people would automatically build houses whenever they found suitable ground to live on. In Populous: The Beginning, your workers are not so ambitious. You must decide the type and placement of every edifice that is constructed on each of the worlds. This requires not only a significantly greater amount of time, but also requires some basic resource management as well. Oh well, no one ever said that becoming a god would be easy.  Each of the different buildings in the game serves a specific purpose designed to turn your workers into more useful tools. The most basic structure, the hut, serves as a place for your followers to live, and more importantly, a place for them to breed. As long as tribesmen stay in a hut, they will work slowly towards creating more tribesmen. As you continue to play the game, you'll get access to more complex structures that will help you in your attacks against the enemy. A few of the more basic examples are the training camp where you can turn tribesmen into warriors, and the temple, where you can turn tribesmen into priests. Like the original two titles, Populous: The Beginning does an excellent job of giving you access to new abilities (in this case buildings and spells) as you go along, so completing each new level gives you a feeling of power and control.  Speaking of powers, this new game's got 'em in spades. By forcing your way into the enemy's Tower of Knowledge, you can uncover any special powers that that tribe has. Early spells include the fire bolt, which sends a small ball of flame to smite one enemy, the lightning bolt, which sends a large surge from the heavens to lay waste to an enemy building or a group of threatening warriors, the tornado, which spins its way around enemy camps sucking up people and buildings alike, and the swarm, a vast cloud of insects that sends any enemies in its way running for cover. Each new level carries with it the discovery of new spells, and by the end of the game, you'll be able to make the earth open up and swallow our enemies or send hot lava to destroy their homes. While many of these spells were also available in the earlier titles, seeing them in 3D makes all the difference in the world.  Not only is Populous a lot of fun to play, it looks great as well. Every action that the little people make on screen is displayed and animated well. The spell effects are often breathtaking (I kept using up my tornadoes on my own cities just to see them slowly tear apart the huts again and again) and I never seemed to get tired of them. Even the interface is designed with fantastic primitive icons that are easy to understand, but do a great job of bringing you into the spirit of the game. The only real beef I have here is that many of the buildings look alike, and it's often hard to tell in the heat of battle which structures do what. Still, this is a very minor complaint, and doesn't ever effect the overall enjoyably of the game. The game's sound is similarly impressive and features fantastic screams and battle noise as well as loads of little effects for whatever your people are doing at a given time.  Once you've gotten a handle on how to play the game, you'll want to jump on-line and take on some other players. While the single player missions are plenty challenging, there's nothing better than fighting it out with three opponents while all of you are wielding the awesome forces of nature. Most of the games we played here in the building ended up being Pyrric victories with the winner becoming lord a nickel sized land mass that looked like a marshmallow that someone accidentally dropped in the campfire. Still, 'tis better to rule in Hell and all...  In the end I found Populous to be incredibly entertaining for about two weeks. Unfortunately, even with the multiplayer options, I just didn't find myself returning to it that often. Now that your followers are dependant on you for every move they make, you don't get the enjoyment of just watching them live out their lives that was so much a part of the original two games. Still, if you like real-time strategy games, this is one of the most innovative and well-designed examples of that genre to come out in a long time.  -- Trent C. Ward Playing Populous: The Beginning was an interesting experience, especially for those who may have also played any of the Populous series on the PC. Although an excellent port to the PlayStation, those who have played with a mouse cannot help but find themselves limited by the control scheme of the control pad. However, I must stress that this should not be seen as a fault on the game designers, as they've done an excellent job of converting the interface to a console-friendly one. My suspicion is that traditional PlayStation users who have never played Populous before, or have never played on the PC before, won't have any problems. Gameplay-wise, PTB has that all-engrossing time-suck factor that one looks for in classic games. There's something about playing as an all-powerful deity that truly takes you in and keeps you from looking up from the TV for hours. Yes, there are some occasional nits: the sprite-based characters are a little fuzzy and small, and the overhead summation map can get a little confusing, but this is also an artifact from being ported from the PC which has a far higher resolution display monitor. You could remove some of the characters or detail from the PlayStation port, but you'd also lose a lot of that Populous feeling. All in all, Populous: The Beginning is an excellent addition to the Populous series on the PlayStation and is highly recommended for all you megalomaniacs out there!", "date": "Jan 2, 1999"}
