No matter that D came out before Resident Evil, and caused something of a stir when it first came out. It's still not as good as our friend RE, though.  All comparisons aside, D does stand out as a good graphic adventure game. The graphics are excellent, for starters. The 100% rendered characters are some of the most expressive ever seen. Most games tend to suffer from having their characters look like polygonal mannequins, but you really know how Laura, the lead character, is feeling. There's also plenty of scary things going on, like creepy flashbacks and cannibalism, to keep you up nights.  Unfortunately, D is too short - it is easily finished in just a couple of days. It also runs very slowly. The loading time between scenes is incredibly long, as are most console graphic adventures, Alone In The Dark for example. These are mere quibbles though. If you liked Resident Evil, you'll probably enjoy D as well.", "date": "Nov 22, 1996"}
