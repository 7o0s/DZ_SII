{"name": "Samba de Amigo", "name_review": "Samba De Amigo (Import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/05/02/samba-de-amigo-import", "text": "Last summer, I interned at a nameless American video game company, and was shocked at the creative slaughter that goes on behind closed doors. I watched as the industry turned down dozens of wonderful ideas, simply because they didn't fit the mold of what the publishers thought the people wanted. That's right! More first-person Quake  clones! More racing games! More fighting games! We want our concepts to be familiar to gamers! Groan.  Needless to say, if I had thrown together a design document outlining a maraca game, I would have been humiliated and scorned by my superiors. But on the other side of the ocean, it's a different story entirely  in a land where musical games and raw fruitiness in general are encouraged by major publishers,  a game like Samba de Amigo can easily launch off the drawing board and into gaming history.   So here's the setup: you've shuffled your feet to Dance Dance Revolution, scratched the turntables in BeatMania, and maybe even caught a few minutes of practice time on the import version of Drum Mania. Forget all that nonsense. They're all pale shadows of Samba de Amigo, a game that combines instinctive rhythm action with the art of performance. If you throw a party with a copy of Samba and two maraca controllers, you'll be the talk of the town  and your friends may never want to leave.   At its heart, Samba de Amigo is a musical playback game. Unlike Space Channel 5 or PaRappa, you're not playing Simon Says -- all of the playing prompts come from simple on-screen notation. All you have to do is hold a maraca in each hand, and shake it at a high, medium, or low height. You'll also need to strike a pose from time to time  once or twice during each song, a window will pop up and prompt you to hold your maracas in a certain position. You'll learn it in five seconds  trust us.   In arcade mode, you choose a level of difficulty, pick a song, and go through a three-stage musical course. As you play through each song, a combo meter counts up how many notes you've played without messing up (the highest score you get is referred to as Max Amigo). Your overall performance is graded from A to F, and is visually reflected in the on-screen action. If you're doing incredibly well, the screen goes nuts: psychedelic colors start warping in the background, and Samba the Monkey (the game's maraca-playing protagonist) starts spazzing out in a fit of near-orgasmic maraca-shaking glee. But if you keep missing notes, the background fades to black, and Samba mopes in futility, urging you to stop screwing around and get your act together.   But is it fun? Oh, hell yes. Samba de Amigo is one of those games that grabs you by the throat and screams play me, dammit! This has the same addicting-as-crack fun factor as Crazy Taxi, especially when you start getting into the higher difficulty levels. I haven't seen a person who hasn't gotten into the game in some physical fashion  I've seen people bouncing to the music, moving their feet, or shaking the traditional booty. Sonic Team's goal was to create a game that captured the feeling of a late-night drunken karaoke session  and I can fairly say that Samba is almost as much fun as busting out Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds after one too many glasses of sake.  The selection of music is outstanding, ranging from traditional melodies like Mambo Beat and Tequila, to a remix of Take on Me. Unfortunately, Cup of Life and Livin' La Vida Loca are nowhere to be found, thanks to a lack of cooperation from your ~friends~ at Sony music licensing (I'm sure both songs will be appearing in the next Ridge Racer game instead  cough cough).  But Sega has struck back via downloadable music  each week, Sonic Team will be releasing a new VMU download that unlocks new audio tracks. So far, all I've acquired is Open Your Heart from Sonic Adventure, but we can expect to see music from NiGHTS, Rent-a-Hero #1, and even OutRun (Magical Sound Shower! Yes! Yes! Yes!).  With the intense maraca-waggling action, most players may completely gloss over what's going on in the background. Samba de Amigo features 60fps visuals without a hint of slowdown, featuring the exploits of Samba the Monkey and friends as they take a harmony joyride. The backgrounds are packed with sexy cat-girls, drum-pounding teddy bears, dancing cactuses, and buildings that warp and distort to the Latin beat. Fans of Sonic Team will be happy to know that the package contains the same over-the-top trippy art design as NiGHTS, and should not be experienced under the influence of certain illegal chemicals.   I've got to be honest  with its arcade roots, Samba de Amigo is a bit on the short side. But Sonic Team has seen fit to include plenty of extra goodies to keep you playing, so here's a list of the Dreamcast-only goodies:  Original Mode: Identical to arcade mode, but gives you access to all of the game's music at once.  Challenge Mode: A five-level course with three to six lessons apiece. Challenge Mode requires you to get certain letter grades, accuracy rewards, or Max Amigos. Once you clear a course, more music is unlocked.  Battle Mode: Each player is given a power bar and a bomb. As your Max Amigo score increases, the bomb grows in size until it detonates. The last player left standing is the winner.  Love-Love Mode: Pretty bizarre. Two players play at once, and the game determines their romantic compatibility while making screeching monkey noises. At the end of the round, a heart comes on screen and states your chances of gittin' it on.  Mini-Games: Good stuff. Includes whac-a-mole, an accuracy game, and activities that reward spastic shaking and posing. ~Monkey Replay~ is a simple beat-copying game  it would have been nice to see a more expanded version of this.  Training Mode: Lets you go through all the songs without risk of failure.  Internet: Lets you head online to the Samba de Amigo homepage.  Voice Select: Plays a custom sound set whenever you shake a maraca. You can unlock different voices in the mini-games, including some rather fascinating monkey grunts.  When you put it all together, that adds up to a colorful trip through the world of maraca-based percussion. And if you're going to embark on the journey, make sure you come prepared: the maraca controllers are a must-purchase for this game. Let me be frank: playing Samba de Amigo with the standard Dreamcast controllers is awful. The control layout is perfectly playable, but it offers none of the maraca-intimacy  the big draw of the arcade version. It's worse than playing House of the Dead 2 without the gun, or Virtual On without the Twin Sticks. If you wanna play Samba, you'd better be ready to go all the way.   So there you have it. As long as you've got the maracas, this is one of the most enjoyable niche games to emerge from Japan since PaRappa, and should be on the must-buy list for anyone who has a thing for music games, samba, or dancing monkeys. Though American higher-ups might have balked at the original concept of Samba de Amigo, I'm absolutely tickled that Sega of Japan had the cajones to bring it out. Now if only American publishers could take that initiative... -- Colin ~Shake It Like a White Boy~ Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "May 2, 2000"}
