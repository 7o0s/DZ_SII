Easily a dozen distinct franchises have brought us bunches fun over the years, and each new installment is usually highly anticipated. The problem with such popularity is that everyone wants a cut of the action, and many are willing to pump out the same basic design established years ago. Thankfully, Besieger does do some things differently, but it still has problems breaking out of the ~build town, build big army, send them over to the other guys, destroy~ mold.  Town construction is based on the familiar contruction tree design, where you generally can't make one type of building until you've made another. You start out with houses, which generate five workers (and those can be upgrade to produce ten workers), so there won't be a way to endlessly pump out workers from a single building. When you create a sawmill or forge, one of the workers who built it will need to be permanently attached to it. So your overall number of workers is dependent on how much space you have to build houses, and eventually you may run out of them. When you build an infantry or ranged unit barracks, you'll have to send a worker through to train them, so your army can only be so big. So the game prevents a ~zerg~ rush of just being able to load up with as many units as you can and walloping the enemy by sheer numbers. Also, resources are finite and don't regenerate, so you can't just build and build until you have some massive, impenetrable fortress. So far, so good.  The terrain and objects are all fully 3D, so you can rotate and zoom and pan all over the place. Although units are animated a little robotically and look a little blocky, you won't need to zoom in much, anyway. In fact, I found myself wanting to zoom out far more than the game would let me. You can typically only get your town in the whole frame, and the camera will only travel a certain distance away from your units. The camera's altitude limitation means it will go nose-to-nose with a mountainside. Unfortunately, when you pull away from such a wall, the camera reverts to hugging the ground, and you have to manually zoom back out every time this happens. It gets frustrating, particularly in the underground levels, since you'll naturally be panning into walls all the time. And although I can appreciate the strategic realism of not being able to see all the topography at once, I didn't get the impression that the enemy AI had this same limitation. They typically seemed to know exactly where my town was and what kind of forces they needed to send. They would also often have large groups patrolling chokepoints, which makes sense theoretically, but how would they know to cover Fork A and not Canyon B?    These annoyances can be ignored if the game is otherwise deep and fun. However, there is a serious problem with pathfinding, made all the more apparent because it's at its most problematic when dealing with the central them of the game: fortification. Time and time again, I could not convince my regiment to all go out the front gate as a group. Some would split off in random directions, and others would get stuck on the edge of the gate. It seemed that if the AI detected it could not get through a certain spot while maintaining formation, it would then decide to do an end-run to get to the destination. I personally would prioritize getting there as a group over getting there in lockstep. The same problem occurred when trying to enter an enemy town surrounded by a wall. Tell them all to move to the center of town, and they would go to the town wall, bumbled around for a few seconds, then break like a wave. And since there's collision detection, they get stuck bumping into each other a lot. Want to move your mounted units to the front? You have to wade through all the foot soldiers, and they don't quite move out of the way so much as they realize someone's bumping into them and grudgingly take one step to the side.  The other unit problem is default temperament. Every time you transfer from one section of the mission to another (broken up by some unfortunately hammy in-game cutscenes), everybody goes back to the aggressive mode, though ~bloodthirsty~ would be more accurate. All it would take is one enemy unit within sufficient range, and everyone would break ranks and go chasing after it like a pack of hyenas on a poodle. I'm quite thankful that ranged units actually try to keep their distance from melee attackers, instead of standing there toe-to-toe, getting cut to ribbons--but their militant rage does me little good when they go rushing ahead of the armored melee fighters who are, in theory, tactically positioned to protect them. Plus, you will have a healer early on that will need to be manually moved around the map, as she can't and won't attack the enemy. It would have better if, when I clicked on an enemy, she knew that I didn't expect her to attack it, but would instead interpret this command as ~this is the unit my fighters will be attacking, so go over there.~  Thankfully, your men will eventually be able to take quite a beating, as they gain experience from kills that will eventually boost their damage, and the town will have plenty of buildings granting upgrades to attack speed, range, and other stats. You have to highlight a unit to see its health bar and experience, though, so clicking and dragging over a huge swath of units is necessary to gauge the strength of your forces, and getting your healer to patch someone up is complicated by the lack of permanent icons. And often, inexplicably, she will refuse to heal someone. However, if you bring her close enough, she'll automatically start doing her thing. This wouldn't be so bad if there weren't many sections in the game where you had to keep a specific unit alive.I was having a good time with this game until I encountered my first town wall, which was actually my town wall. I watched with disappointed disbelief as my units struggled mightily to understand the simple process of leaving through the gate. There was a gathering enemy force outside, and I simply could not bring my men out to meet them. Single units had trouble navigating through the gate even when the path was short and straight, so my pre-emptive attack was ingloriously snuffed out. The game's built-in zerg rush prevention is refreshing and invites strategic creativity, but the pathfinding (and the formation-breaking aggression) bring it right back down to earth. There are so many other places to go for your RTS jones that it's difficult to look past the aggravations.", "date": "Jun 9, 2004"}
