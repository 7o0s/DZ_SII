For all intents and purposes, RRV will make fans of the series proud, as it's probably the best. It doesn't have the same impact of R4, which pushed the PlayStation further than most people thought possible, but when you look at both games purely as racing games, RRV is the better of the two and is the series' best.   Gameplay  One of the reasons that Ridge Racer V might be the series' best is that it brings back the same basic feeling of control that players were presented with in the original Ridge Racer without the annoying collision detection problems that plagued the series up until R4. The feel of the cars, whether drift or grip, and the techniques used for powersliding through turns are much more like the early games in the series and this is definitely a good thing.   However, on the negative side, the track designs and number of tracks and options don't appear to be as good as what we got in R4. Most of the tracks aren't really that new and are pretty easily mastered by those who have played them in any of the previous games. On the other hand, even with the unoriginal track designs, the game does offer a great deal more challenge than R4 and is a better racing experience on the whole because of this.   Unless you put the game on the Easy setting, it'll take quite a bit of practice before you're able to complete all of the game's championship modes and while once you are able to finish the various tournament racing modes, there are plenty of reasons to keep on playing as there are numerous cars and secrets that can be locked up as you play through the game.   This is where the game really shines, as it's not only loaded with plenty of secrets, it's so amazingly fun to play that you'll enjoy all the time you spend putting into trying to unlock them. Sure, the game's physics are completely unrealistic and aren't based on any real-life equations and the computer AI is pretty simplistic in nature, but the end result is an amazingly addictive racing experience.    Graphics  Okay, let's get this out of the way -- Ridge Racer V does suffer from aliasing and flickering problems. This is the game that pretty much started all of the aliasing talk and because of issues with the way the game was programmed, Namco wasn't able to implement the same anti-aliasing in the U.S. release that it was able to do with Tekken Tag Tournament. Because of this, you'll notice lots of stair-stepping with the edges of the game's 3D polygons and the backgrounds will flicker more in this game than most of the others ones that you'll see on PlayStation 2 at launch.   In spite of this, there's no denying that Ridge Racer V is a fantastic looking game and one of the most visually impressive in the racing genre that we've seen to date. First of all, the game has some amazing 3D backgrounds that are impressively detailed and contain some breathtaking special effects. The trees, for instance, are some of the most realistic looking that you'll ever see in a videogame, and the reflections, while not rendered in realtime, look almost exactly like they do in real life. The only problem with them is that they don't reflect what's above them and are predetermined. They still look fantastic, nonetheless.   There are also plenty of other cool graphical touches including sparks that fly from the bottom of the cars after landing from jumps, realistic lighting effects with the cars' headlights, lights that come on when the cars enter tunnels, and dashboards that'll illuminate themselves when in the dark. If you can overlook the aliasing problems, and you really should, you'll see that there are more good things to say about the graphics in Ridge Racer V than there are bad things. This is a beautiful game.   Sound  Ridge Racer V gets some major props for what it does in the audio department. While it doesn't get the perfect 10 because it some a few major stinkers in its soundtrack, as a few of the songs sound like they're skipping (which is very annoying after a while), the soundtrack is still pretty amazing on the whole and is up to snuff with what you'd expect from a soundtrack for a Ridge Racer game. It's not quite as great as R4, but very good nevertheless.   Where the game really excels as far as audio concerned is with the sound effects. Most players probably won't even notice it when playing the game, but the sound of the cars change based on what the cars are passing by and how close they are to the objects. The engine noises have also been done extremely well and it's easy to tell that a there was quite a bit of effort put into making the audio in the game.  While I'd rather be playing Gran Turismo, there's no denying that Ridge Racer V is a fantastic game and easily one of the best the series has ever seen, if not the very best. In fact, as far as I'm concerned, there's not another Ridge Racer game that I'd rather play than RRV. The fact that it controls more like the original pleases me beyond what words can describe and what makes this even better is that it has most of the things that were done the best in R4, including more varied tracks and improved collision detection. If you're looking for a pure, arcade-style racing game for your new PlayStation 2, then you should buy Ridge Racer V.", "date": "Oct 24, 2000"}
