It seems I say that about Sega's game each year, but that's because Sega's ice hockey title always seems to improve. Despite the $20 price tag, developer Kush Games hasn't let the series slide one bit. If you love hockey or if you are simply a fan of hockey video games, there's no reason not to pick up ESPN NHL 2K5. Harder hits, smarter AI, better gameplay, a deeper Franchise Mode, and online leagues? Yeah, there's a lot going on this year to be happy about. It's not all perfect -- in fact, there are a few things I have major issue with -- but overall NHL 2K5 is the only hockey game you need.  Present Yourself Sports games have come a long way with gameplay, but it seems that many sports games -- particularly hockey and baseball -- are far behind in terms of presentation. NHL 2K5 does add a few nice presentation touches, like nifty crowd cut-scenes, with crowds appropriately attired for the home team, but doesn't come anywhere close to the brilliance of sister NFL 2K5.   While the cut-scenes, great auto-replays, and ESPN overlays are all nice touches, where are the post-game interviews, dramatic Franchise Mode scenes, or studio cinemas? None of the things we tend to demand from our football game are here and, frankly, I'm sick of it. There's no reason that after five years of making hockey games, Sega can't give us some substantial presentation extras.  Kush has done enough to make NHL 2K5 look pretty with lots of nice little bells and whistles that will give you some nice visual touches. I like the cut-scenes between periods, particularly the cheerleader shooting t-shirts into the crowd. She's the bestest. I just want more bang for my buck -- even when it's only 20 bucks.   The Skybox from last year returns, with some minor improvements. You can't trick it out like your crib, but you will be able to view trophies, purchase dozens of unlockables -- uniforms, teams, fantasy arenas -- and play a couple of different mini-games while you're at it. There's even a pedestal for your future Stanley Cup to rest, though winning it will prove challenging thanks to a fantastic Franchise Mode. Playing the trivia game or a game of shuffleboard is a nice distraction and it's always cool to have something to take your mind off the game of hockey, but these bonus items are just sideshows that won't hold your attention for more than a few plays.  Along with the Skybox, the user interface has seen little change and remains clumsy. I know that it's not a big deal that you have to go to the options menu, then select save/load, then select load, then select your franchise to finally get your franchise loaded, but ya know what, Sega has had terrible UI for five years now. Get it together already. It seems that not enough people complain about the bad UI to force Sega to change, so allow me to be the first to groan about it. There should also be an autosave option and the ability to load your franchise when you choose Franchise Mode from the menu.    What really upsets me, however, is that there are extra game features that you will only find by accident. When you are in the team select menu, there are options for setting line matchups (so that you put out a specific line to match specific players on the ice) and also the ability to choose defensive and offensive playsets. You probably will never see them, because you have to be fortune enough to press the proper button to stumble upon this, as there's no text (not even in the help menu) to let you know it exists. That's just stupid.  The good news is, while Kush dropped the ball a bit on upping the presentation to the standards expected of other sports games, the gameplay itself (what really matters) has seen some welcome upgrades.  The Play is the Thing Gameplay has always been the 2K's strongpoint and the same can be said again this year. Thanks to a healthy number of sliders and five difficulty settings, you can truly set NHL 2K5 to play how you like. I can make this game like NHL Hitz if I want and at the same time make it even tougher than real hockey. To me, the realism and difficulty of scoring goals -- the need to clear the net, to pass, to utilize my teammates -- is what makes NHL 2K5 so enjoyable. I know there are folks that want to play fast and loose and just have fun, well with NHL 2K5 you can have both.  This is not real hockey, but that's okay. There's a great flow to NHL 2K5 and there's just always at least a small amount of tension, even in the neutral zone. I wish the crowd could get into it as much as I do, but it is an intense experience in just about every single game you'll play -- especially if you go to Pro difficulty or above.       For those who've never played a Sega hockey game, I should warn you that NHL 2K5 requires you to use some true hockey skills to score. Sure, you can occasionally slap the puck top shelf and get lucky, but if you hold turbo all the time, skate straight and the goalie, and never pass, you are gonna get frustrated, because the AI is too good to be beaten easily. There tends to be some really heavy congestion in front of the net, especially if you have a team that's not physical and can't clear the net easily, and this means that you'll need to pass and stay on the move to try and thin out congestion.   You can use the new Pass and Go option, which allows you to pass the puck while retaining control of the passer, to then try and clear out the congestion on your own so your teammate has a better shot, or you can position yourself for a one-timer and call for the pass. It's something we've seen in basketball games for a few years and it makes perfect sense for hockey. You don't have to use the Pass and Go to score, but it's another option that veterans will find helpful and one that I'm really digging.  When you do manage to get a decent shot on goal, you're still going to have to worry about the goalie himself, because this year sees some new animations and better puck physics. You won't see the goalie catch the puck and freeze it all that often. Instead, you'll get desperate blocks and deflections and a lot more rebounds. This sometimes leads to some truly spectacular plays, like diving for a rebound and slapping the puck in mid-air for a goal, but also adds to the intensity near the net.   On defense you have a lot greater control than in years past thanks to two new additions. First, there's the Intense Contact Controls, which allow for devastating hits in any direction by using the Right Thumbstick. Bump a player as you skate beside him or try and hook him from behind if you want. I affectionately call this one the Penalty Stick, as wanton use will often lead to slashes and other dirty plays. It's all dependent on your positioning, but most gamers will probably just slap the stick every time, resulting in a lot of time in the box.  My favorite new addition is the Total Stick Control. By holding the Left Trigger, you skate backwards on defense. You can then use the Right Thumbstick to move your stick in any direction. This isn't meant for tripping or slashing, instead this is basically allowing you to fully control your poke checks. Once you master this skill, it's really quite an awesome tool and one that makes defense a lot more enjoyable. It's not longer about big hits (though those are still plentiful), you can not fight for the puck and break up offensive plays if you have some skill. An awesome addition.    If NHL 2K5 has one problem, it's the same that seems to plague every hockey game -- There's just not enough action on or around the boards. Except when play nears the net, most of your hockey time is down center ice. There are few battles on the boards and the AI almost never uses the boards for passes or even for protection. This does make the game a bit faster, flow better, but it definitely doesn't represent an NHL game. It's fine for game purposes, but even having all the different options when being pinned against the boards seems silly, since it will so rarely happen.  Team Building Franchise Modes are a must in sports games and it's been a weak point of the NHL 2K series for a while. Kush is trying to change that by adding some more depth to Franchise. Allowing up to four players to get in on Franchise Mode, your work as coach and GM of your chosen team takes place in a virtual office. The office itself isn't all that exciting, but Kush has taken some elements from other Sega Franchise Modes to bolster some of your options.  At the start of a Franchise, you'll need to hire your coaching staff. This affects player development, health, scouting, and overall performance. The minors play a big role throughout the course of years in your franchise, and scouting is going to be a major factor in trades and the draft. While you can always just look at a player's stats, if you use your scout to check an NHL player, you can learn about their strengths and weaknesses. This will help for trades and also will help NHL n00bs who don't know their Naslund's from their St. Louis'. Your scouts own abilities determine the tourn around for scouting players and his ability to judge talent.  Though scouting, coaches, and a much better draft system have been implemented, NHL 2K5 still doesn't take any major Franchise Mode strides. It's more-or-less just a nice update. It's certainly the best Franchise Mode the series has seen, but it's still lacking the kind of ingenuity we've previously seen from Sega Sports games.    Party On, Dudes The Skybox has air hockey and shuffleboard to help pass the time, but there are a variety of other modes that Kush added to keep things interesting. The cool Skills mini-games from last year return, but a new Party Mode has been added. This awesome mode, which is available both online and offline, has a variety of customization options and a healthy number of mini-games to enjoy as you compete with others in various skill contests.  The Party Mode is the kind of thing that anyone can enjoy, even those who hate hockey. Get a keg, bring over some friends, and spend the night trying to guide your player through traffic cones and other crazy feats. It's a lot of fun and works well for a quick online game.  Speaking of online, Sega continues to impress on Xbox Live. After several games online, I've yet to be hindered by lag on Xbox, though once my game did crash midway through. The overall experience is like playing with a buddy on the couch. This year sees the introduction of online leagues, which should add to the longevity of a game that generally doesn't survive in my Xbox past the end of the year. If you don't have online capabilities, it's okay, you can still enjoy NHL 2K5 with a few buddies on a single machine, but the online experience allows folks like myself to play old hockey buddies. IGN has seen a few editors leave for greener pasture in the past year and two of them play hockey games religiously. Thanks to online, that bond can remain and since online works well with NHL 2K5, that's easily the online sports game of choice.  Seeing is Believing Sega makes ice hockey look quite attractive. Whether it's the awesome faces (some that look spot-on, some that look, uh, spot-off), the variety of animations, or the deterioration of the ice throughout the course of a period, NHL 2K5 is a pretty game. There are some very occasionally bits of slowdown -- so few, you may never notice them -- but otherwise the game runs beautifully particularly offline where the hockey seems a bit faster.   The goalie animations have been improved, as have some of the hard hits. The crowd during gameplay is in 3D, though not very detailed, but in cut-scenes wear puck hats, jerseys, and have their own pre-rendered animations to lend a little extra vitality to a hockey game. The reflections in the ice are a nice touch and the player models, while a bit generic between players, look like real people.   The audio from last year returns, but with about 40% new material. I love the flow of the commentary. Sure, there's repetition -- particularly when talking about specific star players -- but the commentary is almost always on-topic. When a replay shows a great save by a goalie, Garry Thorne and Bill Clement talk about it. The discussions really keep you in the game. I do wish there was even more new content, or perhaps some old content re-recorded so that it doesn't sound stale, but definitely a solid team and some great commentary.  NHL 2K5 includes some songs that play in menu and from the PA system at games, but on Xbox you have the option for custom soundtracks. Unfortunately, this isn't implemented very well as you can't cut up your songs a la NFL 2K5 nor randomize them, so it basically ruins the pleasure that could have been earned with some proper foresight.  NHL 2K5 has some excellent gameplay elements and enough new twists to easily make it worth $20. If you don't have that kind of cash to give hockey a try, get a job you lazy bastard. Seriously, just work at McD's for a few hours and you'll be able to purchase this fine video game. This is a better game, pretty much from top to bottom, than last year's version. However, I am giving it a slightly lower score. The lack of any true dedication to better presentation is distressing and a lot of the improvements seem too minor. Can Sega please make a sensible user interface? Ah, but enough of my complaints. If you want a quality hockey title that's fun online and offline, has some nifty bonus modes, and the best hockey gameplay you can buy for 20 bones, do yourself a favor and pick up NHL 2K5. It's fast, it's fun, and it's challenging -- gotta love it!", "date": "Sep 1, 2004"}
