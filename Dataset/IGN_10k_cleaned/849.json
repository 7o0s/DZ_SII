M4, the developer responsible for the surprisingly good Tazmanian Devil: Munching Madness release last year, has thrown realism out the window in favor of an intense, fast-paced, and (most importantly) fun racing game specifically tailored for the handheld system. Destroy what you know of the Nintendo 64 version of the series -- it's a rarity, but the Game Boy Color edition beats out the console version.  Features 16 Supercross tracks Three season circuits Seven professional Supercross racers Only for Game Boy Color   Instead of trying to do the whole ~behind the vehicle~ style of racing the N64 and PlayStation versions provide, M4 instead designed the Game Boy Color from scratch. What we're offered is a six-man racing game in a fixed, scrolling overhead perspective, and for the capability of the Game Boy Color, this choice works extremely well. It's pretty darn close to what Excitebike would look in 3D on the color handheld.  In the game you must make your way through the game's dozen tracks, trying to beat the pack of five other computer opponents. While they can be beaten by expert control (like handling the turns tightly or coming off of jumps straight), you'll need the upper hand. In this case, that's in the form of power-ups. The only way to earn a power-up is to perform a stunt off a jump, which is a huge incentive to practice up on your showmanship. But a trick only guarantees a power-up will appear on the track -- it's up to you to collect it to activate it. There are four that the game randomly offers -- a speed boost for, well, an extra boost of speed; a defensive shield that gives you the temporary ability to knock others off their bikes; a smart bomb that, when collected, knocks the closest person in the lead off their bikes. And a skull and crossbones...careful, this is the only ~zonk~ in the bunch. Pick this one up and you'll get knocked off your bike. Whoops.  The tracks are well designed and challenging, offering plenty of jumps, turns, and obstacles to make the race interesting. The final race of each set offers something a little unique to the action: in places on the tracks are fans that'll blow your vehicle into the air. Figure them as jumps without the dirt hills.   The only real problem with the game is the sense of accomplishment isn't really there. In the tournaments, you must climb the ladder to reach the higher 125cc and 150cc classes, as well as the tracks and each class to earn the right to choose Jeremy McGrath. But both the higher classes and Jeremy McGrath are selectable in the Arcade mode -- only the tracks can't be chosen other than the groups they're in. If these options were hidden until after they were uncovered in the Tournament Mode, it would have added more to the replay value and challenge of the game. And while the tracks do offer a bit of variety in their designs, it's hard to play this game and not want just a little bit more.  But those really are the only gripes to this satisfying racing game. Okay, one more: no multiplayer support. I've said it once, I'll say it again -- the link cable port is built onto the system for a reason. Use it. Jeremy McGrath  would have excelled further if we had the option of linking two systems together to play against our friends. The console versions offer splitscreen support for two or more players -- at least give the handheld gamers their own take on the multiplayer design.  Acclaim handed the game over to the right developer -- M4's version of Jeremy McGrath works very well. There's definitely room for improvement (especially in the link-cable department), but as it is the game is a lot of fun to play.  I really like the power-up addition, since it encourages the use of the stunt button. Hey, you should be rewarded for your showmanship -- a tiny animation of your rider just isn't satisfaction enough. I just hope that if the guys at M4 are working on another batch of racing games, they include the link-cable in their design docs. They've got the structure down -- now they need more substance.", "date": "Apr 10, 2000"}
