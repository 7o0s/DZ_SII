He's big. He's green. He's smelly. And he burps a lot. What's not to like? But in the hands of the wrong developer, or even in the hands of the right developer under impossible time constraints, not even Shrek can make an awful experience less so. Unfortunately for gamers TDK Mediactive's Shrek Extra Large is such a case. It's a revision of an awful Xbox game made worse in its sloppy transition to GameCube. If you're still reading, what's wrong with you? There's nothing to see here.  The Facts  Shrek license New side storyline in which Shrek must save Princess Fiona from Merlin A total of 10 warped fairy tale levels  Brand New twisted fairy tale characters!  Great power moves such as punch, kick, grab, super-flatulence, and belch! New non-framerate feature New totally un-fun feature   Gameplay Shrek Extra Large is based on the popular movie license that sold countless tickets and more recently gazillions of DVDs, but it employs an all-new side storyline. In it, Merlin's goons have kidnapped Shrek's beloved Princess Fiona. Merlin proposes a trade of sorts: If Shrek can defeat the evil Ice Queen and break Merlin out of his prison, he will return the Princess safely to Shrek. The green ogre reluctantly accepts the proposition and the game begins. Unfortunately.  Put simply, this is not a good game by any measure. It's a platformer adventure mess. Players must guide Shrek through a wide selection of large, badly designed levels and complete run of the mill puzzles. There is enough in place to qualify as a game, but just barely. Shrek enjoys passable control and solvable puzzles. That's about the best we can say about it. There is little in the vein of satisfaction to be found.  Shrek himself doesn't move well. Control is already sub standard for most platformer games as it is severely hampered by a massively flawed camera system, and it doesn't mingle well with the platform heavy levels either. Also, thanks to one of the worst framerates in any GameCube game to date, the character seems to sludge through the environments rather than glide through them, and this has a bearing on gameplay.  Collision detection is lacking in many regards. When Shrek encounters an enemy and hits them, it never feels as if his punch has connected. As a result, the characters don't actually feel as if they are part of the universe so much as they seem like animated objects.   In its defense, Extra Large has at least made some proper use of the license. Some of the characters from the popular movie are back and worked into some of the game's many puzzles, which usually revolve around finding an object or guiding them to it. But with so many bad elements surrounding this license, gamers aren't likely to feel inspired or compelled to complete anything unless it involves turning the GameCube's power off and ejecting the game for good. Really, no one should even bother with this one.  Don't buy this game Graphics Gamers who remember the bump-mapped technical demo that was Shrek for Xbox are in for a visual disappointment with the franchise's transition to GameCube. In place of the extensive bump-mapping is no bump-mapping and in place of the smoother framerate is a jumpy, jerky one that is anything but consistent. The game still spits out large, fairly detailed worlds with a decent degree of geometry, characters are still high in polygonal detail, and many of the textures are crisp and colorful. But it's all torn to bits between the improper fluidity and poor animation, which cripples the movements of characters big and small. It's a shame. We're positive Shrek creator PDI, which is known for its smoothly animated computer graphics, would not approve.  Sound The audio portion of Shrek is probably its best element -- and that's still not saying much The game has extensive voice dialogue and audio samples, sound effects and more. Shrek's belches, big and loud, are just as grotesque and humorous as they were in the feature film. On the other hand, there are levels in which the voice samples are cued improperly, and there are also times when there is no music or sound effects to be found, and in which Shrek must walk through an almost totally muted environment. Like the rest of the game, nothing special.Whether you're a Shrek fan or not, don't buy this game. It's awful. It's exceedingly poor, actually, and it is so in a gaming industry that now hardly ever releases products that fall below the average. That makes it a standout in crap execution. For that reason alone, it's interesting in the same way that rubbernecking around an exceptionally grotesque car crash might be.Shrek wouldn't want you to see him this way.If you have kids, don't rent this for them -- it might be contagious.", "date": "Nov 12, 2002"}
