He's seen additional versions on the SNES, the Game Boy, and two games on the N64. And now the Mariner hits the Game Boy Color exclusively in Ken Griffey Jr's Slugfest, a mediocre baseball game that's all interface and not much else. Features Full MLB and MLBPA license Statistics tracking Battery backup for seasons in progress Exhibition, season, World Series, and Home Run Derby modes Only for Game Boy Color   We'll give the developers credit where credit is due -- Slugfest is a great looking Game Boy Color game. The initial features and interface -- from the rotating baseball where you select your game mode, to the player trades and season tracking -- is well done, and feels like they spent an abnormal amount of time making the game as deep and as easy to get into as possible. Problem is, it seems like this is where most of the energy went, because the rest of the game is rather pathetic. Slugfest has obviously been designed with the original SNES Ken Griffey Jr., the game developed by Software Creations back in the early 90s. The Game Boy Color game has also been developed by Software Creations. As much as I loved the first Ken Griffey on the SNES (one of the closest games to mimic SNK's Baseball Stars on the NES), this game is just a bad conversion and really needs a tune-up in the programming department.  In its corner, the game is extremely colorful and detailed, especially in the non-game graphics (with Ken Griffey's digitized mug in the background). But I guess with the vivid graphics comes a horrible trade-off -- the scrolling of the infield and outfield is downright choppy. This is just unacceptable -- trying to follow the action as the screen sputters around is almost enough to make your eyes water. Worse yet, the camera is way too close, so it's extremely hard to find a player close to the ball. They've added arrows to represent where the player-controlled man is in relation to the ball, but it's not enough. The camera should have been placed higher in the air when the ball is hit. I guess the designers wanted to show off their pretty graphics so much that gameplay took a back seat. Slugfest feels a bit rushed --you'd expect music in some locations of the game and get none, and a few sounds are nothing more than fluttering white noise. Computer AI is, many times, downright stupid. I hit a ball right in front of the catcher, and he just sat there covering homeplate with the ball a mere pixel from his foot, waiting for the pitcher to grab it. Worse yet, the game doesn't even have a two-player link-cable mode. Now if this doesn't scream ~We gotta get this game on the shelves PRONTO,~ I don't know what does. I'm extremely disappointed in Ken Griffey's Slugfest. I was a big fan of the original Super NES version of the game, despite the arcade feel and offensive gameplay. The design was quick, fun, and smooth. This Game Boy Color version is none of that -- it could have been designed so much better, but it looks as if they wanted to show off their color techniques rather than to give a great playing game of baseball. So far, as of this writing, the best handheld baseball game goes to SNK and its Baseball Stars Color. It's a damn shame what happened to pocket Griffey.", "date": "Aug 18, 1999"}
