In Ratchet & Clank, barely a second goes by without collecting something; bust open one of the series' ubiquitous crates and hundreds of bolts spill out, bust open the skull of an enemy and - like some kind of bizarre pinata - hundreds of bolts spill out. It's a veritable collection-fest, and on top of bolts are a number of other collectables. It becomes a core component of the rhythm of the game, but the genius of the system is, of course, that the more you collect, the more you can buy, and the more devastating you become. In the world of Ratchet & Clank, arms dealers lurk around every corner, selling a cornucopia of destructive delights, while other merchants offer armour upgrades and other tools.   In the case of Tools of Destruction, the more bolts you collect, the more weaponry you can buy, and the more 'raritanium' you find, the faster you can upgrade said weapons. Plus, the more you use each weapon, the quicker it levels up. Like previous games, it's essentially a multi-faceted experience system, and a totally gratifying one at that, encouraging the player to explore every corner of the world and to constantly upgrade - and use - their full arsenal. And what an arsenal it is. It's only fitting to lead any discussion of the aptly named Tools of Destruction with talk of firepower because this has been one of the chief attractions of the entire series, and so it is again.    Grind rails. Not as much fun as they look, sadly.  Over the course of the game you'll build a formidable armoury, from early weapons like the Fusion Grenade (~nothing ruins an enemy's day like a thermonuclear hand grenade~) and the Tornado Launcher, which literally fires a Six-axis-controlled tornado which you can use to swoop up enemies and crates, through to the Shock Ravager - an electrified whip just perfect for taking out enemy shields. Then there's the Nano-Swarmer, which unleashes a deadly insect payload on your enemies, while the Shard Reaper is basically a nasty buckshot weapon, allowing you to ~perforate your foes with high-velocity spikes of trillium ore.~ Tasty. For R&C fans the load-out is a compelling combination of new and remixed weapons, while for newcomers it'll be a revelation.   Not only does each weapon level up through use, but each also has a honeycomb grid of potential upgrades. Stop off at the arms dealer, and you can trade precious raritanium for upgrades. At a basic level you can increase things like ammo capacity, damage done, area of effect and the distance you can target from, not to mention boosting how many bolts and raritanium you get from killing enemies with it. Then there are specific upgrades for each weapon. The Predator Launcher, for instance, can be upgraded to lock-on to six targets simultaneously, and fire two missiles at each target. Even the humble Combuster, the plasma pistol you begin the game with, becomes a mean beast (the Magma Combuster) when fully upgraded, firing triple shots of super-heated plasma and scorching the earth with plasma napalm. The weapons are a riot, and just when you start to think that it would be cool to have something new to play with, invariably that's exactly what happens.   Staring up into the inky blackness, Ratchet was reminded of the insignificance of human life. Thankfully, being a Lombax, he didn't dwell on the thought too long.  Tools of Destruction also introduces a number of 'Devices' that Ratchet can use. You've probably all seen screenshots or videos of the Groovitron in action, and it really is gold. Throw one of these suckers out and it hovers in the air like a disco ball, projecting multi-coloured lights down over an area, forcing all enemies within its reach start to boogie. This is as close to You Got Served: The Game as we're going to get, and factors into one of the more amusing challenges in the battle arena section of the game - ~Smack Down at the Disco~, where literally hordes of enemies come out in waves and you only have your wrench to defeat them. Thankfully, Groovitron balls also pop up every minute or so, giving you a window in which to dispose of as many dancing enemies as possible. Like we said, pure gaming gold. In fact, it's worth staying stocked up on these bad boys (you can only carry three at a time) just so you can check out the dance routines of every new enemy you encounter. The other Devices are less over-the-top than the Groovitron, but useful nonetheless.   The combat, then, is a deliciously explosive brew, and very much the core of the gameplay. There's more to Tools of Destruction than just shooting, however. This is - after all - an action platformer, and Ratchet is pretty versatile, jumping, gliding and grapple swinging himself through the world. Clank also gets his time in the limelight, commanding an army of robots and slowing time. Woah. And let's not forget the requisite mini-games. Space combat and gliding/skydiving (with Six-axis tilt control naturally included) are just a couple.    So, what exactly is Ratchet's rationale for rampaging across a score of planets killing (almost) everything that moves? Well, he's being hunted by the minions of galactic overlord Emperor Tachyon. It seems Tachyon's entire race - the Cragmites - were vapourised by the Lombaxes, and now he's hell bent on taking out the last Lombax - Ratchet. As Tachyon's forces pursue them, Ratchet and Clank search for clues about what happened to the Lombaxes, and Clank discovers a thing or two about himself as well.    The story is told - as you would expect - with lashings of humour. The dialogue between Ratchet and Clank is as amusing as ever, and delivered with aplomb by both the voice actors and animators, who have done a great job breathing gobs of personality into the pair. Tachyon proves to be a worthy comic foe as well, constantly broadcasting hilarious messages throughout the cities under his control. As in previous games, a lot of the humour comes from the character designs and animations. You've got to love the Drophyds for instance - tiny, fish-like creatures housed in glass tanks atop stomping great robots. Take out the body and the Drophyd flops about, bug-eyed and helpless on the ground. A single swipe with Ratchet's wrench is enough to kill it, or you could just squash it by walking over it. We're also a fan of any game with space pirates; particularly skeleton faced brutes with great big spiked clubs who proceed to play air guitar on said clubs when you drop a Groovitron in their vicinity. As expected, Qwark makes a few comical appearances too, in one section helping Ratchet 'disguise' himself before entering into a combat tournament on Planet Mukow, by way of a false moustache and purple plastic glasses. Cunning.   There's something fishy going on here. (I'm so, so sorry).  The settings are just as impressive. Tools of Destruction is very much a visual showcase for the PS3, but in the sense that the art design is fantastic, rather than on a purely technical level. Sure, the game can have tens of enemies on screen at once with nary a hitch, but this isn't a super-detailed world. Thankfully, relatively low poly surroundings and low(ish) detail textures just aren't an issue when each setting has this much personality. Kortos, for instance, is a city comprised of domed buildings hovering in the sky above the orange haze of a massive drop to the planet's surface. Several moons hang low in the sky, massive spacecraft moving in front of them in a low orbit, while hovercraft zip about between the buildings lower down. Planet Ardolis, on the other hand, is the hideout of a gang of space pirates led by Captain Slag, and the setting is incredibly evocative of this theme. Tropical mountain slopes shield the base from the rest of the planet, while a warren of caves meander around the perimeter of a wide lake, where the main buildings sit, perched atop craggy rock islands. Again, a massive moon sits low in the sky, helping the setting feel otherwordly. It's the perfect backdrop to a wretched hive of scum and villainy.   Tools of Destruction isn't perfect, however, struggling to find the most compelling gameplay balance in some levels. The opening sections, for instance, didn't really grab us, being - both literally and figuratively - a little too much like being on rails. You'd run along a linear path, hop on a grind rail (snore), run along another linear path, jump up to a new area via an automated jump point, then get back onto another grind rail and so on. It was obviously designed to showcase the scope of the new world Insomniac has created, but to be honest the art design is so strong and the world so vibrant that the team really didn't need to worry. Thankfully, after a weak opening level (just one of many we should point out), it really picks up, and you're soon exploring much more interesting areas. Sure, the design still falls back on the old 'go and collect six doohickies to open the way forward' a lot of the time, but it's still a load of fun choosing which way to venture out from the hub area that you land in.   Clank - the best robot since Metal Mickey.  What it basically boils down to is the fact that Tools of Destruction is at its strongest when it's letting you explore and pitting huge numbers of enemies at you. When it gets a little gimmicky (grind rails/jump pads) it's less compelling. Same deal when it tries to be too much of a platformer. Take the level based in the Nundac Asteroid Ring as an example. One half of the level consists of teleporting between the planetoids surrounding a massive space station, and harvesting the souls of the Leviathans (huge alien beasts swimming through space). There are certainly platform elements here, but it's grounded in shooting stuff, and great fun. The next section, however, sees Ratchet riding moving platforms, jumping from platform to platform and avoiding big stamping machines. The design sounds and looks cool - lots of gravity flipping and a buzzing reactor core, but it's dull to play, simply because there's no action, and there's no puzzle component to the platforming. Thankfully, the dull sections are few and far between, and really only stand out because the rest of the game is such a blast.  Tools of Destruction isnt particularly progressive in its game design, nor is it particularly difficult, but its a joy to play nonetheless. Theres just so much to collect, so much explosive firepower to wield, and so much charm to the environments and characters that youd be crazy to let this game pass you by. Dont expect a radically new vision of Ratchet & Clank  this is very much an extension of the series, but its the most polished and accomplished game in the series to date.", "date": "Nov 13, 2007"}
