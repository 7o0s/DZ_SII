You know, the type of game that when you first hear about it, you utter to yourself ~Wow, this could be cool...~ but when you sit down and play it, all you can think is how neat it could have been if they had just done some things differently.  I-Spy: Operation Espionage is one of those games.  The promotional art for the game is phenomenal, and with the industry's current obsession with all things stealthy, the concept of taking a team of handpicked agents with individual skills through non-linear missions that can be solved any number of ways seems like a sound-enough concept.  Heck, I was even getting flashbacks of an old NES game I loved as a kid, Rescue: the Embassy Mission.  Alas, my nostalgia was misplaced.  The storyline in I-Spy is not exactly the stuff of Metal Gear Solid.  This game takes place in the year 2000, but this must be an alternate year 2000, because in the game's world, there is no longer such a thing as a government.  Large corporations wield the political and financial power of the world, and numerous industrial spy organizations have been established due to the newfound interest in such services by these corporations.  The top group of industrial spies is known as Blitzstrahl, and you play the ~Boss~ of this organization.  Your character is never actually seen throughout the game.  You interact with the game through the spies who work for you, a group known as Espion Agents.  Each agent has a certain specialty that can be used to your advantage in various situations.  For example, a young boy named Archangel is quite the whiz at hacking into computers while being useless in combat situations, a Frenchman named Falloux can mix chemicals with nasty effects, and a teenaged girl named Luria has the universal skill all spies should possess: the ability to roller blade.  All told, there are seven agents to pick from, some of whom you may never use depending on how you tackle the levels, and at a certain point, an eighth agent may become available to you.  The character designs for the agents are absolutely phenomenal; every character seems to tell a story just in their appearance. (see this story for high-res character artwork).  Sounds pretty cool so far, right?  Well, unfortunately, this is where the good points stop, as once you get to the actual game, the honeymoon is over.  For the first mission, you are assigned agents, and are required to steal a painting from an art museum.  Of course, it's not as easy as just walking in and taking it.  Alarm systems must be deactivated, guards must be disposed of, and security files must be overwritten.  You are given a brief intro where your agents inform you that they have successfully entered the building.  At this point, you take control of the game, and everything falls apart.  Your screen is divided into four: one large screen for the agent you are commanding, and up to three other windows to view your other agents.  You don't actually control any of your agents, rather you issue orders, and watch the agents carry the orders out.  Once commands are laid out, the agents go about their tasks, and you are left feeling a bit detached from the actual game.  You'll spend more time watching things happen in this game than actually playing it.  In fact, left on their own in a room where tasks can be completed, the agents will often take the initiative and begin doing things without being ordered to, giving you even less to do.  One nice thing is that depending on the agents you brought along and the way you think, the missions can be completed in a variety of ways.  This is good, because if you are looking for an obvious solution for each mission, you are looking at the wrong game.  Sometimes what you are supposed to do is so obscure, you might as well just resort to sending agents from room to room observing things until events are triggered.  Although at times the puzzles approach logic, they usually hang somewhere on the other side of absurd, and the stilted dialogue doesn't help.  Like the puzzles, sometimes the translated text skims close to normal, but most of the time suffers from anime syndrome.  Individual statements seem right, but when put together into a conversation, it can be tough to make sense of things.  After each mission is completed, you receive your pay, which really just contributes to an overall score, and AP, which are used to upgrade your agents' skills.  Once you've spent those points enhancing your employees, you can choose which mission you want to take on next.  After choosing the mission, you are brought to a planning screen where you can get a bit of a preview of the level ahead of you, as well as some strategic details which may help you complete the mission.  You then pick your team and plunge in.  Repeat for all ten missions.    Perhaps the underwhelming interactivity wouldn't be as apparent if the environments and characters looked pretty enough to distract you.  Sadly, they don't.  The character models themselves aren't that bad, but the excellent designs are wasted by being thrown into surroundings as drab as these.  Numerous gray hallways sprinkled with rooms that contain very sparse detail...I know real life offices and labs aren't too interesting, but embellish a little, this is a game!  Alas, even the passable character models are ruined when they start moving, as the game contains some of the blandest animation I've ever seen.  It's not terrible or anything, just really boring.  Every character runs the same way, except for the little rollerblading girl who glides with the greatest of ease.  In fact, each character seems to share an awful lot of animation routines, including the guards.  It's just another snag that would be overlooked if everything else was okay, but amid all the other problems, it becomes fairly apparent.    Sound effects are pretty spartan as well.  You'll hear footsteps, gunshots, and the odd typing on a keyboard, but other than that you are limited to hearing the overused voice clips of the agents and the ultra-weak music.  The voices aren't too bad, but the characters don't have much to say other than ~Okay, boss~ and ~I got it~.  As for the music, it would have been middle of the road on 16bit.  In the here and now, it's trite, it's tinny, and it just fails.  Add into all of this that there are only ten missions, all of which could conceivably be beaten in less than a half hour each on your first try, and the fact that once you've gone through it you probably won't care to go again, and you have a rental at best here.  Not a solid rental either, more like one of those games you rent when you've played all the good stuff to death and you feel you must try something different.  At the very least, you  may appreciate its original concept.  -- Shaun Musgrave, Contributor", "date": "Jun 10, 2000"}
