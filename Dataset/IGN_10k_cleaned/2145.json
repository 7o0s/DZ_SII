{"name": "Throne of Darkness", "name_review": "Throne of Darkness", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/10/04/throne-of-darkness", "text": "Everyone makes such a big deal out of this game being exactly like Diablo. But while the two games certainly have a lot in common, there are more than enough differences between the two to make Throne of Darkness stand out on its own. The mythological, Japanese setting is the most apparent difference but the real innovation here is the game's focus on group adventuring. Sometimes the design decisions beneath this approach work, sometimes they don't and sometimes they don't even make any difference whatsoever.   The back-story is compelling (if a little predictable). The big shogun on the hill decides that he wants to live forever. Naturally, a passing monk just happens to have a potion that confers immortality on its imbiber. (Imbiber is a word that only Latin majors and role-players would ever use.) Anyway, as you can probably guess, the potion also opens up a gateway for the demon Zanshin to possess the body of the man in charge. Now that he's all demonized his kingdom has been plunged into darkness. Now it's up to the four daimyo in the service of the shogun to rid the countryside of monsters and defeat the evil demon.  Although you are sort of cast in the role of the daimyo, he won't be the focus of the game. One of the perks of management is that you can delegate all of your demon fighting responsibilities to a handful of lackeys. It's sort of the same principle I invoke whenever I need Ivan to review Dragonriders of Pern and Political Tycoon. Anyway, you'll lead a team of seven different samurai on a quest to defeat Zanshin. You'll need to clear out the wildernesses and castles surrounding Zanshin's fortress before heading off for the final battle.  On your side will be seven samurai. You can only control four of these at a time, but you can switch them in and out at any point in the game. The Leader has a high charisma that is used to obtain discounts from the two vendors in the game. The Brick is your heavy hitter. So is your Berserker and, to a lesser extent, the Swordsman. On the subtle side you have the spell-casting Wizard, the stealthy Ninja and the Archer (guess what he does). Although each character has different weapon proficiencies and abilities, the similarity among the fighting characters (the leader, brick, berserker and swordsman) and the finesse characters (the archer, ninja and wizard) kills any sense of variation. Instead you'll find yourself differentiating the characters yourself by deciding how to distribute weapons and armor.  I'm not entirely sure how the experience is awarded in Throne of Darkness but it's my guess that either all or at least a greater share of the experience for killing monsters goes to the character who dealt the deathblow (or at least dished out the most damage). Early on in the game, the brute force characters quickly took the lead in experience (thereby making them more powerful and more likely to gain yet more experience). By the time my Brick was 16th level, I had barely brought my Wizard up to 5th level. You really have to spend more time leveling up the Ninja, Archer and Wizard than the other characters.  During combat, the computer controls three of your four active characters.  It does so through a customizable tactics editor that is as unique as it is unnecessary. You can select from a number of tactical formations (which bear no apparent relationship to the animals for which they are named) and set specific roles for the various characters. You can redefine the player positions in each formation and set aggression levels and weapon preferences. Since you'll be switching out characters pretty frequently, the formation is tied to a weapon type (melee, ranged or spell) rather than a character. Your ninja might fill in as a spellcaster if your wizard is off recuperating. Sadly the formation doesn't readjust its facing when you suddenly turn around and start moving in the opposite direction. You'll just have to call up the formation again and set the new facing. Or you can do like me and ignore formations entirely after the first few days. And have just as much success doing it too.  The spell system offers a wide range of options. At every new level you gain new spell points. These can be used to purchase skill levels for the various spells in the game. Spells fall into the broad categories of elemental and ability-based magic. Elemental spells allow you to dish out or prevent certain types of damage while ability spells add points to your statistics. There are two real weaknesses of the spell casting system. First, with only a few specific exceptions, every character has access to the same list of spells. This means that your Archer is pretty much the same as your Wizard who is pretty much the same as your Leader when it comes to spell variety. You can also only choose one single spell for the computer-controlled characters to cast. Since so many of the spells work better when combined with another spell, this puts a severe limitation on the value of spell casting in the game.  One huge advantage in Throne of Darkness is that you don't have to visit the blacksmith or priest's shops in order to use their services. You can instantly have access to both vendors at any point in the game (after you've rescued them in the first few minutes of the game). The blacksmith is used to manufacture, repair and customize items while the priest is used to identify magic items. There are other uses for these guys but you'll mostly be using only a few of the features with any regularity.  I'll go ahead and quote this from the manual because I think it kind of sums up the whole game:  Items form one of the main ingredients of the game's addictive qualities. They create a Pavlovian reward system that keeps players itching to find out what item they will get if they play for ~just one more minute.~  Not to spoil it for anyone or anything, but the items you get if you play ~just one more minute~ are pretty much the same items you've been getting for the last three hours. Add to that the fact that you constantly have to shuffle the items around from one character to another and you've got an even bigger headache. I must have stopped playing every five minutes just to get my inventory under control. Doing this means giving the right items to the right characters. Unfortunately after the first several hours, you're not more likely to find items better than the ones you're currently equipped with. This makes looting an even more unnecessary and irritating task. You can't even sell the extra items -- all you can do is give them to the blacksmith so he can make even more items for you. And you probably won't need those either.  You could take advantage of the game's magic item creation tool to produce weapons and armor of staggering power. Weapons each have various slots that you can fill with magical components. Sadly you have to pay to create these items. And the only way to get gold is by killing creatures. And, believe me, there's not nearly enough gold in the game for you to even begin to experiment with this feature. If only Click had decided to let you sell your unwanted items for cash, Throne of Darkness would be much more enjoyable.   The single player game involves a number of main quests and a few sideline quests. Although there is a quest log in the game, it wasn't always clear where I was supposed to be going or doing next. On multiplayer you can go head to head with other teams of samurai (although you can't import your own single-player profiles) in a battle to take out Zanshin. Since this takes a long time, don't count on finishing a game any time soon. Once a player has killed Zanshin, he becomes the new dark lord with a group of seven demonic samurai at his control. From here the whole process starts over again. Of course, even if you do manage to finish a full session of multiplayer the odds are poor that you'll want to jump right back in.  Graphically, the game is solid. But like everything else in the game, the graphic palette gets a tad repetitive. The tiles themselves are very well detailed. The problem is that the same tiles are used again and again and again. The character sprites are sharp and very well animated and the monsters you'll face are really quite inventive. Spell effects are, on the whole, well done. But like everything else in the game, they tend towards the repetitive. Sound is average. The combat sounds and voice work evoke a suitably Japanese, storybook impression.  I wish the game had opened up a bit more after the first few days of play. By that point, the routine was pretty well established -- run around killing bad guys and stealing their stuff and then recycling it for items I didn't need only to head out again for even more ass-beatings. It's a formula that only works if you feel like you're making some sort of progress. Throne of Darkness just never offered up enough rewards to keep me motivated. After my characters reached about 15th level, it didn't seem like fun anymore.  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
