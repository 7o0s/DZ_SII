Features  Two Modes: Simple and Original. Regular and Pro Level settings. Card bonus game. Change  dipswitch settings on Pro Level for different game options. Game help feature. Save up to five different player stats. Full bookkeeping features including note in, payout percentages, and credit status. Compatible with NeoGeo Pocket and NeoGeo Pocket Color.   The Game Cherry Master is a slot machine consisting of nine independent reels, which can make up a total of eight lines, three horizontal and vertical lines, and two diagonal lines. There are two different modes, an Original Mode and a Simple Mode. The latter omits the game bonuses, name entry and ability to save high scores. Apart from regular settings, which let you enjoy the slot machine gameplay with normal rules, there is also the more advanced Pro Stage that gives players access to machine settings, adding quick stops, different double-ups and higher bets.  The gameplay? Place your bet, hit a button and stop the reels at the right time to win more credits. There are eight lines, A through H. Numbers next to the letters increase (to a maximum of 8) as bets on lines are made. When pictures are lined up, the total below one of the bonus categories found on the right side of the screen decreases. Once the number becomes 0, a bonus is paid out. It's simple, it's easy, and like real gambling  it can be addictive. Whenever the player wins, two types of ~Double Up~ can be played. ~High, Low~ lets players bet on whether a card placed face down on a table s higher or lower than a card at the top of the screen. The second variation, ~Big, Small~ has players betting  whether a card is higher or lower than 7. If you win, the core earned in the slot machine game is doubled, if you lose, the score becomes zero.  Graphics and sound in Cherry Master are overly simple. Apart from the turning reels, here's not much to look at. But the game's biggest downfall is not its presentation -- it's the lack of variety. There are plenty of casino games out there that feature several slot machines and other types of gambling games for the same price.  The beauty of SNK's Pocket Casino games is that it doesn't take videogaming skills to play them. As a matter of fact, it's obvious that the games are supposed to appeal to an audience other than the hardcore gamer. I can already picture Japanese business men whipping out their NeoGeo Pocket for a quick gamble while commuting on Tokyo's crowded Yamanote train line. On the other hand, unless you find Cherry Master for a very low price, you should really ask yourself whether one slot machine is enough to justify the purchase. A sure bet for fans of excessive gambling  or those who want to wean themselves of it, but not much of a videogame.", "date": "Jul 15, 1999"}
