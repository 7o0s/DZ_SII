Jak 3 and Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal will be hitting the streets with some serious weaponry in November, but for now some intense attention needs to be focused on Sly 2: Band of Thieves. It's been a couple of years since the Editor's Choice with the namus bizarrus of Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus and a whole lot has changed in this cel-shaded world. The gameplay has grown up and Sly 2 become one hell of an adventure that is recommended for anyone who wants some action with plenty of humor along the way.   In Sly Cooper the action was very arcade influenced with some classic platformer elements. There was a lot of jumping, bouncing, and racing against the clock to get to the end of the different levels. It set a style all its own with a living cartoon environment and some clever challenges to get through. The only problem was that it ended all too soon after a few hours of play. There were some time challenges that provided a little extra, but players wanted more. Two years later and that wish has been fulfilled in every way imaginable.   Three for One  As the name Sly 2: Band of Thieves implies, there are now three characters to play around with. Bentley and Murray played supporting roles in the first game, but this time around they are fully playable and fleshed out characters in their own right. Bentley is a nervous green turtle who supplies the brains behind the operations by making the plans for the gang and taking care of all things computer. Murray is different in every way as a burly hippo who provides plenty of punches, belly flops, and all around brawn to get the dirty work done.    While Sly is still the man character here, both Bentley and Murray play as though they were really a part of the game instead of being two tacked-on characters to provide a bullet point for the back of the box. Murray can run rampant through the levels and provide a good beating for everyone that gets in his way. Where Sly can scamper along the roofs and Bentley needs to take a brainy approach, Murray will instead plow through the problems and as the game progress he gains abilities that wreak more and more havoc. When the other characters can get too sneaky, it's time for ~The Murray.~   While Murray is fun and all, Bentley is easily the one that steals the show this time around. Bentley's attacks themselves have a short range and a weak effect so his moves involve a more calculated approach. His initial options are limited to knocking enemies out with a sleeping dart from a distance and then planting a bomb on them, but he gains new skills that have him shrinking enemies, tossing bombs, or even flying along in a hover pack. Whether it's his nervous tics or his fragility, playing with Bentley takes the game in a whole new direction that made us look forward to every new chance we got to play with the little fella.   As the game progresses, Bentley is also the character that has the most amount of development. We won't give away story details here, but with everything that happens to the guy, it's hard to not develop a love for him and all his antics. As the events unfold, Bentley is thrust from the turtle behind the scenes to a crucial part of the operations. And with all three of these guys working together the heists in the game perform flawlessly.   Thieving and Believing  So what do you do with three thieves who have been friends from way back in the day? You plan some serious heists, that's what. Sly's family has been terrorized by a giant mechanical bird called Clockwerk and the first game finished with Clockwerk's demise. As it turns out, Clockwerk was dismantled for parts and different members of the Klaww Gang have taken different parts to help with their various illegal activities. Upon discovering this, it's up to Sly and the gang to get all the parts and destroy them once and for all.      This adventure takes the gang through eight different missions that is filled with several quests along the way to the grand heist to steal a Clockwerk part. Instead of having a hub area with different quests coming off of it like in the first game, the three heroes are based out of their own headquarters and have free roam of the entire environment for that mission. From the very beginning the three different characters wander all over the place, GTA-style. The enemies that are in the streets can attack or be attacked for money. Sly can even sneak up on some enemies and pickpocket them for coins or even some special items that can be sold later. We'll get to that part of the game in a bit.   Once Sly does his reconnaissance of each level, Bentley will start to formulate a plan for getting to the Clockwerk parts. Individual quests will start to appear on the level that can be seen while looking through the Binoc-u-com, a special set of binoculars or by simply tapping the L3 to see the current set of quests pointed out while roaming around. Each quest is custom fit for each of the characters so that each arrow pointing to the start location will be color coded. Blue is for Sly, green is for Bentley and pink is for Murray.   A Game Called Quest  Within these quests lies the core of the gameplay in Sly 2 and they show such an insane amount of variety that it's pretty clear there must be something in the Seattle water that the folks at Sucker Punch Studios are drinking because there is a bizarre sense of humor that runs throughout the entire game. Many of the quests are meant to be run in sequence are often in the spirit of good old Mr. Rube Goldberg, the cartoonist who created a fantastic set of events that needed to happen for a simple outcome. At several of the different challenges presented in the game it's hard to not bust out laughing at what's being asked of you.     Some of these quests are indeed straightforward, but the majority have something distinctly odd. One challenge is to put together a dapper dancing outfit for Sly so that in the final heist he can cause a distraction by dancing with Detective Carmelita while Murray nabs yet another bit of the old Clockwerk. One of the best quests involves Bentley as he has to hack into different computer terminals in order to cause problems with the local mass transportation. Instead of using some geeky puzzle to get through, hacking in Sly 2 involves guiding a little green ship through a 2D maze as other ships attack it. It starts out simple enough with just a couple of enemies, but it quickly develops into a full on rampage that's a cross between Asteroids and Robotron 2084.   If there's anything that ties the quests together it's that the quests barely have anything in common. The same skills will get players through the different adventures, but the quests have enough variety that the game manages to stay interesting and fun throughout the 16-20 hours it should take to get through the story of the game. While there are no speed challenges to play through this time around, there is still the aspect of exploration to find all of the hidden items and unlock all of the different abilities for the characters.   Gettin' Tricky With It  There are a few different ways to make money in Sly 2 and none of them involve an honest day's work. Simply destroying inanimate objects or killing off the enemies will reveal a few coins, but the big money's in theft. Sly can pickpocket the guards that wander around the levels and one of them has a glowing pocket, then it's possible to nab an item that can be sold later on. Even better though are the big ticket items.   Each level contains a few fancy items that Sly can pick up and put on his back. While these fetch the high prices they're also quite fragile. One hit from a guard will destroy them so Sly needs to find a safe and peaceful way of getting back to the hideout. Some of these items even have a security feature that will make them self-destruct if they're away from their intended location for too long. With these it's a race to get back, sometime across the entire map, without getting hit by anyone. It's a challenge, but it does reward the big money.     With the objects safely back and cash in hand from selling them, the three characters can buy skills from ThiefNet, the criminal version of eBay. One skill is made available for each level, adding up to eight for each of the thieves. Each skill is also carefully tuned for the different characters' abilities. Sly gets sneakier, Murray gets burlier, and Bentley gets craftier. Of course, this is still Sly's game so he gets even more.   Just like in the first game, each level has several different ~clues~ that are scattered around the level. These clues are green bottles with a piece of paper sticking out of them and by collecting all 30 in each level it's possible to unlock yet another skill for Sly. That makes a grand total of 16 for him and 32 for all the unlockable skills combined. It's a sizeable set of abilities and each one is done so that it expands upon each character.   Another new feature is that multiple skills can be cued up at once. The R1 button is used for running, another new feature, and the other three shoulder buttons can be assigned to three different abilities. With multiple abilities the characters can truly become multifaceted agents in the field. This provides some deeper elements to play around with. The different abilities are also balanced out since there is a power meter that gets depleted when any ability is used. This can be filled up by finding the health power-ups.   Get a Life  With a whole new world to explore and lengthy quests to complete, the characters here have been given life bars instead of the one-hit death from the original. This bar is good enough for four or five hits from the various guards in the game. To even it out, the guards themselves have life bars as well and require multiple hits to be killed. Health power-ups can be found along with the coins that come out of objects or enemies and with this new system the game has much more give and take.    In Sly Cooper the game had more of an old-school feel as gamers lost a life if they fell into the water. Here, the game is more user-friendly since a drop into water or off a cliff will only take a small hit off of the life bar. There is also a lack of a set number of lives. Any death will simply set the player back to the headquarters if simply roaming around or back to the last checkpoint in the current quest.   Style File  All in all, the gameplay has been changed to create the experience of a fun and friendly adventure for gamers and in this attempt the developers have succeeded tremendously. The different characters with the open worlds and the large variety of gameplay with a whacked sense of humor running throughout adds up to a lot. But wait, there's more! The graphics have been given a tremendous tune-up as well with a much smoother engine that rarely has any slowdown at all. With the exception of one part of a level in India, there were never any technical issues that we noticed getting in the way of the game. But besides the smoother engine there have been some overall improvements to the style of the whole game.   Both the level design and the characters have been improved dramatically. Since the levels get a lot more face time with quests running all over them they've also been pumped up with lots of details that serve to flesh out even further the style of the bosses that inhabit them. One of the better areas is in Prague which has plenty of gothic elements that are fit for the spidery boss that runs the whole place. There truly is a feeling that the locations actually fit into the whole storyline. In fact, there are several times when there is interaction with the bosses well before the final battle.     In a very cool move, the bosses are often seen and dealt with during the individual quests. Sometimes this can mean trailing a boss along the rooftops and staying out of sight. Another time this can mean pickpocketing keys off another boss in order to open a door. One of the most intense quests comes later in the game where Sly needs to move around a room and stay hidden while the boss is walking around the room at the same time. All of this helps to continue the overall storyline of the game and keep the bosses as fleshed-out characters rather than caricatures that only come in at the end for a fight.   Aural Examination  It's rare that voice acting will truly ring just right in a videogame, but in Sly 2 that's certainly the case. The three heroes have been done perfectly and Carmelita sounds much better than before. Additionally, the different bosses have all been done with just as much skill. Once again, though, we need to especially point to Bentley as the star of the show. Rarely have we ever cared about a game character so much as for this little neurotic guy. With the different voices coming together so perfectly it wouldn't be surprising if the developers had some cartoon experience in the past. Regardless, when the voices are combined with the storyline the game comes together even more as a satisfying experience and helps to make this adventure one worth taking.   Equal care has also been taken with the background music that takes care to fill out the environments with sounds that are appropriate for each mission without overwhelming the action. One of the best parts comes in the first mission inside of a dance club. The boss here is a reptilian nightclub owner named Dmitri and the fellow can't get enough of himself. As Sly gets closer to the nightclub the bass of the music can be heard at first. By getting closer, the rest of the music fills in and when inside the music turns into an extended dance remix with Dmitri on the mic. Along with the music he gives props to his friends and urges everyone to dance. It's a lighthearted touch, but one that makes the environment come alive with his presence even when he's not in the area.    It's amazing what two years can do for a development company and it's clear from playing through Sly 2 that the folks at Sucker Punch Studios have been putting their heart and soul into creating a game that is both fun and entertaining at the same time. The amount of creativity that is packed into the different quests and the various characters is nothing short of amazing and it all combines to form... Mega Fun Adventure! Fans of the original will have plenty of new features to dig through, but by no means is knowledge of the first game necessary.If anything, the only thing that keeps Sly 2 from being even better is that there is a lack of things to do once the game has been completed. It's possible to repeat the adventure, but the lack of time trials and challenges to complete once the game is over leads to a lack of replayability. With over 20 hours of gameplay involved in collecting all of the items in the game, and a hell of a game at that, this is far from a dealbreaker, but it's still a slight disappointment.What really distinguishes Sly 2 is that the whole game is a unified experience where there are many different parts to the game, but all of them fit in together smoothly. This is not a game with a story that is an excuse to tie everything together, but is absolutely integral to what's going on. Sly 2 is one long, strange trip and we urge you to take it.", "date": "Sep 3, 2004"}
