Sure, not all of them were fun, but those that offered a true balance of challenge versus reward often enticed the most veteran of gamers.  Players didn't have the option of simply saving anywhere, or having unlimited lives, or being virtually invincible during combat, allowing for multiple shots to be inflicted before destruction ensued.  R-Type III is exactly that game: ludicrously difficult, yet ridiculously addictive.   When first released back in 1993, R-Type III offered several new features previously untapped in the side-scrolling space shooter genre.  First was the implementation of the new Mode-7 technology, which enabled developers to scale and rotate backgrounds, adding more realistic perceptions of depth (Mario Kart and Final Fantasy VI, to name a couple, also used Mode-7).  Second was the idea of the ~drone~, called forces, which could be affixed to the ship and provide a secondary source of laser fire.   The previous R-Type had these forces, but what the sequel offered was the ability for the forces to be detached from the ship and move about, sometimes even freely depending on the force type, and engage the enemy.   The game lets you choose between three force types: Round Force, Shadow Force, and Cyclone Force.  Each has its own unique ability, such as the Round Force's 4-way blaster, or the Shadow Force's high speed return system, which lets you quickly return the force to your ship.  This becomes integral to survival, for when the forces are detached from your ship, while they offer offensive capabilities, they do nothing to physically protect your ship.  While attached, however, they provide protection from enemies either in front or behind, depending on which end of your ship you choose to place the force.  After selecting the force, you're thrown straight into the action.          Don't blink.  Seriously, get some eye drops and 4 cups of espresso, because if you hesitate, lose focus, or get distracted for one moment, it could mean death.  The action is fast and furious, and a seemingly endless stream of relentless attackers is constantly thrust upon you.  Holding X emits a rapid fire blaster from the ship, while holding Y lets you charge up for a big blast.  By pressing R the power-up mode is changed, allowing for yet another powerful burst, as well as the discharge of rapid fire explosive ammunition.  The trade-off with this more powerful attack is that your ship overheats and you lose your charge ability temporarily.   The game can be fairly unforgiving, and this can lead to a good deal of frustration.  Your ship only takes one hit to be destroyed, whether it's from a tiny projectile that sneaks up on you from behind, or even you accidentally grazing the top of the screen as you concentrate your fire elsewhere.  Further, there is no adjustable difficulty setting; this is perhaps balanced out by the fact that even after losing three ships and the game over screen appears, you can press continue and pick up right where you left off.  The enemies and levels are quite challenging, and the boss fights are unique and can drive even the most balanced player to the brink of insanity.  With all the swarms of enemies comes a tradeoff, though, as the developers pushed the SNES hardware to its limits, creating beautifully rendered ships, and complex explosions.   With all this happening the game can experience frequent slowdown - thankfully this does not interfere with the gameplay, but it can still be pretty irritating.  Adding to the processing time are the game's 169 different sound effects (you can listen to each one in the option menu) as well as a catchy techno-rock soundtrack that keeps you in the action.   But the fun can only truly be maximized by plugging another Classic Controller into your 2nd Wiimote and thrusting your buddy into the maelstrom of death and destruction (dun dun duh)!  The 2-Player mode is extremely fun and adds serious replay value to the game, even with the already challenging single player campaign.  So how does it all translate?  The game is a hell of a lot of fun.   Even 14 years after its initial release, one can still appreciate the game for what it is  a challenging beast that youll keep wanting to slay again and again.  R-Type III is definitely one of the best games available on the Virtual Console at the moment, and most assuredly worth the 800 points.   So hop on the shopping channel and start downloading.", "date": "Feb 22, 2007"}
