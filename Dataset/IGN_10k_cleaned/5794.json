But with Glu Mobile's new puzzler Daily Puzzle, subscribers now have three chances a day to feel like an absolute maroon. Daily Puzzle is a three-a-day puzzle game from the mind of expert puzzle designer Scott Kim. Every day, Glu will download three new puzzles into your handset -- one of each type: Logic, Spatial, and Verbal.   You have one chance to answer each of these puzzles. And the big catch is that you won't know right away if you indeed got it correct. The only information the game is willing to part with on the same day is how many players answered like you. The following morning, Glu will reveal the answers and update the scoreboard.   That's when you start feeling dumb.   Of course, the inverse is true. Daily Puzzle could be the ultimate picker-upper. Ace all three puzzles offered every day and you can stride into work feeling like a supergenius. Such is the emotional roller coaster of Daily Puzzle.   Now, you can ask for a hint with each puzzle -- but there is a catch. Should you use a hint, your score will reflect it. If you're feeling especially competitive, you may downright agonize over using a hint for upwards of five minutes.   The puzzles themselves are good fun. We're loathe to ruin too many of them here (look at the screens below), but needless to say, they run from easy-breezy to outright hair-pullingly difficult. Also cool, when you download the game, Glu gives you the previous seven day's worth of puzzles so you have more to play around with than just the three current teasers.  Daily Puzzle is an extremely good value. Just think, for a one-month subscription, you get 90 puzzles, plus the 21 puzzles offered up right away after downloading from the previous seven days. The presentation is clean and simple, making it a breeze to navigate. I can see how Daily Puzzle could become a fast obsession for many gamers, especially considering that results are posted and you are ranked versus other players.", "date": "Jun 8, 2005"}
