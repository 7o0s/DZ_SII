In most social circles, bragging about being lucky enough to witness the expert Kasparov face defeat at the hands of computer Deep Blue is never going to earn as much respect as, say, delivering a speech describing how your favourite football team rocketed to victory in front of your eyes. Chess clubs at schools and colleges are quiet, subdued affairs: the few that turn up are hardly going to advertise the fact in neon lettering.   Of course, it could be that people nowadays are often afraid to discuss their real interests due to the stigmas attached to them. The image attached to chess prevents people from seeing that it's actually a perfectly enjoyable game of skill and tactics. After all, since its birth around the 6th century, it has appeared in hundreds of shapes and forms spanning a massive variety of mediums. Chessmaster first showed up on the black and white Game Boy about ten years ago, this color re-release hoping to reaffirm its position as the ultimate electronic simulation. Features: 16 difficulty levels  Teaching Mode  Timed Chess, Blindfold Games, and Open Book Library.  Set up pieces in any position to play, analyse and solve chess problems.  Takeback/replay options Link cable support for two players Battery save For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  I'll go out on a limb and say that Chessmaster is as comprehensive a chess-sim as you could wish for. This makes it hard to review, though, simply because reviewing the game means reviewing chess itself -- your enjoyment of this depends purely on how fond you are of the original.  The vast wealth of options caters for all tastes and makes this ideal for players of any skill. Unlike in some products, the computer takes very little time to decide on its move, despite the higher difficulty levels presenting opponents that may as well be genetically bred super-players. People with friends are extraordinarily well catered for, since -- in addition to supporting the criminally under-used link-cable - Chessmaster can be played two-player with just the one machine, by handing the console back and forth. In that respect, this is perfect for those budget car-journeys. Unfortunately, there isn't any tournament-type structure for the single player -- there are only individual games. The different combinations of moves and strategies should, though -- just as with the board version -- provide an infinite variety of matches.  Some of the options are incredibly neat. The most useful is probably the in-game tutor, which adds guidelines when you select a piece, mapping where each can be moved to and so giving a huge amount of help to novices. You can retake moves, change the default layout of the board, swap sides and lots more. Interrupted games can also be saved on the cartridge for getting back to later on.  Technically, there isn't much to talk about. The menus could be a bit clearer and easier to navigate, but they do their job. Likewise, the in-game graphics are hardly sophisticated; but, though basic, with simple sprites and basic coloring, they are as good as they need to be for the game to work. The different pieces are all recognisable, and any more detail would probably make things cluttered and confusing. You can choose what color each item of the game is, too, making this a control freak's dream. The sounds are mere bleeps -- but wouldn't a full musical score be distracting?  So, it's a perfect chess simulation. Whether or not that means it's any good is up to you.   If this was being reviewed as a chess simulator, I'd have to give it a perfect score -- in that context, it's flawless; and if that's what you're looking for, you won't find anything better. Unfortunately, Chessmaster has to be rated as a Game Boy game too -- and it's one that definitely won't appeal to everyone... There's nothing wrong with it, other than the fact that the concept itself will bore some people senseless. On the other hand, a portable version of one of the world's most famous board games, relegating the need for a large playing area and fiddly pieces, is simply ideal for the console, which was, after all, designed for those on the move -- and this simulation is as complete as could be.
