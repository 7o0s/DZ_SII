What began as an idea for a skateboarding game has become the de facto standard for all extreme sports titles to live up to. Many might say that just as Madden  it's to football, so  it's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater to extreme sports. It accompl it'shed th it's so quickly because it defined what gaming addiction  it's all about. The formula of including the best pro skaters, most extensive trick l it'st, a never-ending combo system, and brilliant level design keeps gamers coming back with frothing mouths. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, the latest addition to the druglike franch it'se, delivers on everything  it's predecessors accompl it'shed and takes the experience to a whole new level. An expansive career mode, improved combo system, slicker v it'suals, and massive venues make th it's the best Hawk ever. The only wrong we could accuse it of  it's  it's lack of innovation and progress, but that's a mild complaint for a game that  it's so seductively good in the first place.The FactsTotally revamped Career Mode requires you to explore the gigantic venues and talk to peopleLearn of 190 goals that get harder as you progressOnly objectives are timed, so you choose your time spent in each levelLevels are altered mid-game for competitions and special objectivesSpecial Pro Challenges await those who proclaim to be the bestExpanded Create-A-Skater, now with scaleable limbsPlay as one of 14 top pros including Tony Hawk, Steve Caballero, Chad Muska, Rune Glifberg, Geoff Rowley, Bam Margera, Kareem Campbell, Buckey Lasek, Bob Burqu it'st, El it'ssa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Andrew Reynolds and Eric KostonImproved skater physics lets you grind moving traffic and skitchAll-new spine transfer adds yet another link option in an already extensive combo systemProgressive scan and widescreen support for HDTV enthusiastsNo Dolby Pro Logic II supportRequires seven blocks of memory for Career Mode and two for a custom skaterGameplayThe Tony Hawk's Pro Skater franch it'se has defined the extreme sports genre with  it's frantic gameplay, which lets gamers form unthinkably huge trick sets in the massive semi-real it'stic worlds. There's a constant drive to go for that higher score, or that incredible trick your friends can't pull off. Th it's  it's what s it's at the very core of the gameplay, and it's exactly what captivates players from the first time they touch it. Around th it's, Neversoft framed the rest of the experience with licensed pro skaters, a deep Career Mode, the ability to improve character attributes, tons of unlockables, Create-A-Skater, and a skate park creation tool. The result  it's the multi-million selling, dangerously addictive THPS franch it'se. Naturally, ever bit of th it's goodness  it's found in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4. Over the years Neversoft has made minor refinements; the tricks system deepened with manuals and reverts; levels increased in size; and objectives and moves more fantastic. If you've stood by and witnessed th it's progression firsthand in the past three Hawks, you should have a good idea of what to expect for th it's latest version. But don't sell THPS4 short by dwelling on that thought. Neversoft has made more improvements than you may presume.  Career Mode, the main drive behind the single-player experience, has been significantly reworked and improved. It has always been an objective-based mode, but the goals have usually been tuned to a two-minute clock and could be completed at any time. Hawk 4 changes all of th it's. Gone are the days of two-minute runs. Each level  it's now chock-full of over a dozen goals that must be obtained by talking to people in the level. There's no time constraints on exploring the gargantuan levels, so you never have to reload, which detracted from the experience before. All over you'll find various members of the populous will have blue arrows hovering over their heads. Just skate up to any of them at anytime, tap the X-button, and chat it up with them about a new objective.     The objective l it'st  it's extensive and varied. The usual goals have returned; you'll meet up with other pro skaters that will challenge you to break their scores; snobby schoolteachers will ask you to spell ~S-K-A-T-E~; and, annoyed bystanders might request that you knock down the empty kegs of beer that some college students left behind. Thankfully, th it's  it's hardly all there  it's to the rich objective l it'st. Hawk d it'sciples can now indulge in a number of humorous and even extravagant events. For example, one pro skater might challenge you to break h it's record in a downhill slalom race that  it's akin to bobsledding. Another race has you crashing through a level inside of a shopping cart. Then there's the inclusion of other sports in mini-game form. You may hear some voices coming from the mound of a baseball diamond. Answer them and you'll be able to earn some cash by batting a few balls over the wall. The whole setup gives the game more of an adventure feeling. Like a real skater would, you just cru it'se around the levels and get involved in new activities. It's a wonderful new direction for Career Mode, and redundancy  it's minimized thanks to the creative mini-game objectives. There's an incredible amount to do with a total of 190 goals, which include 15 hardcore Pro Challenges from the licensed skaters themselves. Additionally, there are hundreds of gaps to cover, thousands of dollars of cash to bring home, and a ton of levels, secret characters, decks, and other m it'scellaneous things to unlock. There's been a major content dump, making Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 the biggest ever. Instead of taking less than 30 minutes to complete, th it's Hawk will take many hours the first time through. Level progression  it's balanced with the use of Pro Points. For each objective you complete, you get a point. It takes eight points to unlock the first level and the cost slowly ramps up from there. The design sticks to th it's linear fashion, because by the time you reach the final level, the goals are very difficult. So you've got to pers it'st. It's a pretty nice balance overall. Neversoft  it's always keen on creating a challenging environment, but not a frustrating one. Usually around the time you're ready for a new level, it only takes a little assertion to unlock the next. Regarding level design, Neversoft has finally made that leap into the next-generation with truly gargantuan, multi-tiered environments. More impressive than the sheer size, though,  it's the opportunity to create complicated lines. As you come off of a 20,000-point grind and manual into the elevator in Alcatraz, you'll find a whole new line ready and waiting for you on the rooftop of the complex. The available trick lines are more fantastic than they have ever been before. When you get good enough, you'll be able to create Superman-worthy combo sets. To expand on the trick possibilities, just as it did with the manual and revert, Neversoft has included the ability to perform spine transfers by holding the L and R triggers. So, if two halfpipes sit back-to-back, you'll be able to smoothly transfer into the next one and continue your trick line. Spine transfers basically level you out to conform to the ground beneath you, so it can be used for more than just transfers. You can use it to bail out of a quarterpipe or halfpipe trick gone badly, or just to embell it'sh an otherw it'se already impressive vert trick with some grinds. It sounds like a minor addition, but it's another piece of the puzzle that gives you flexibility to link up almost every trick. The whole package  it's pretty incredible and easily meets the high standards set by Hawk fans. Plain and simple, th it's  it's the best Tony Hawk's Pro Skater ever and still the king of the extreme sports genre. Fans that have an unhealthy addiction with the previous titles or those that have never played the series have no choice but to buy Neversoft's latest masterpiece. However, the design of the series  it's hardly groundbreaking or remotely new. If you've begun to feel saturated by the franch it'se or the genre as a whole, there may not be enough newness to warrant a purchase, even if th it's  it's the most refined version yet. We might call you crazy, but that's because we're Hawk junkies. Whatever your final dec it'sion  it's, don't m it'ss out on playing th it's one. GraphicsNeversoft has ditched using the RenderWare engine, and the results speak for themselves in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4. The humongous worlds load with few problems, animations are improved and more varied, and the texture resolution has been upped in most instances. There are still a lot of  it'ssues with texture seaming and art direction, but we can't deny that the game looks good. It runs at 60 frames per second the majority of the time, but unfortunately the engine begins to sputter when drawing some of the huge areas and even transparencies. The whole game could benefit a lot from more impressive lighting, especially. It just lacks atmosphere as you travel from one level to the next.  The most impressive aspect of the graphics engine  it's probably the animation system. All of the skaters move fluidly and some of the special tricks are very elaborate. The crash animations have also been expanded upon. Depending on the angle and height of your crash, your character will fall with some variation. Lastly, we should make mention that the programmers and designers took some time to consider HDTV users. THPS4 supports both progressive scan and true widescreen. If you can take advantage of it, it's most definitely worth it.SoundAs always, the soundtrack  it's awesome. Featuring h it's from old-school favorite Iron Maiden with ~Number of the Beast,~ Biz Markie with ~Body Rock,~ Less Than Jake with their punkified ~All My Friends Are Metalheads,~ and a number other art it'sts including Goldfinger, Gang Starr, De La Soul, The Sex P it'stoles, NWA, The Cult and many more for a total of 35 songs. It all comes down to a matter of taste, but for skating music th it's  it's a pretty stellar selection. On the sound effects side of things, it's all of the same grinds, ollie taps, splashes, and spinning wheel sounds that you've heard before. But, it's a library that has grown to be pretty impressive with a lot of new additions too. For starters there  it's a ton of in-game voice. Every character that you get a goal from  it's voiced, some of which are even from the pros themselves. Then nearly every surface you skate over has a slightly different sound tied to it, ranging from smooth pavement to soft grass to cracked sidewalk. And, whether it?s a ship in the harbor or an animal off in the d it'stance, there are a ton of ambient sounds to hear. Overall, the team did a great job as usual, but there's always room for improvement. Upping the surroundscape with Dolby Pro Logic II support would be a nice start, and just improving ambience as a whole with echoes in tunnels or things of that nature would add to the aural enjoyment of the title. I have skating experience in my past (including my own backyard four-foot' halfpipe), so it's very safe to label me as a Hawkfan from the start. Where I once delighted in dropping into a halfpipe without cracking my tailbone or pulling off rock 'n' rolls, I can now in my ripe old age of 22 get my kicks by performing misty flips over 12-foot high stone archways. Activision's defining extreme sports skater lets me do things I could never have dreamt of. Of course, it's not even about the realism, THPS4 is most certainly over-the-top, but it adds to my pleasure.What makes THPS4 so playable is that it builds upon an already addictive gameplay core. The trick system and level design, above all in my opinion, are what makes the series a must-play. Everything flows and works properly. It's totally fast, frantic, and, perhaps, even mindless fun. The Career Mode, now fleshed out with a sort of story element and varying styles of gameplay, including tennis, slaloming, baseball, and so much more, is far better than it has ever been. I think having to talk to the people to gain objectives is a great idea, and often humorous.Long story short: this is absolutely, without a doubt, the most complete and impressive edition of the THPS series yet. If you spent over 10-15 hours with the previous versions, you'll easily do the same with THSP4, which is massive in terms of content. At first, it feels like nothing but a rehash. However, the truth be told, THPS3 was a rehash of THPS2. Neversoft has made some significant improvements with this fourth edition, and it shows. If you didn't reserve your copy, you had better get in line at your local retailer quick. The only reason not to buy Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 is if you've grown tired of the gameplay or feel saturated by the genre. Even then, the series is still king of the extreme sports world. Do not miss out on it. Buy it. Rent it. Just play it.", "date": "Oct 23, 2002"}
