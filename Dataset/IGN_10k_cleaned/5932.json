It's sort of a shooter crossed with a racer. But, as usually happens in these kinds of cases, the game as a whole suffers.  About the best that can be said about Impact Racing is that it's a very mediocre game. You drive a car (there's five to choose from, but they all pretty much handle the same). Each car has lasers mounted on the front of the car, and more weapons, like mines and missiles, can be picked up along the way. You drive around a track, racing more against the clock than the other cars, because they're there pretty much to shoot at. If you pick up enough extra time, you'll get to go to the next level.  After a couple of times around the track, you realize that nothing more is going to happen than just driving and shooting. There's no power slides or crazy handling like Ridge Racer, nor is there the intense weapons-based competition like in WipeOut. What you're left with is a game that's neither here nor there, a mediocre performance throughout.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
