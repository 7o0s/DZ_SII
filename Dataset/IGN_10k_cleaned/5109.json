The collaborative effort between wireless developer/publisher powerhouse JAMDAT and the venerable console/PC publisher Activision tries valiantly to emulate the successful formula of the console series that has sold in the millions. This wireless edition comes quite close, but the limitations of the format work against the title in several respects. But JAMDAT knows the hardware, and they make due with what they have. And in the process, they manage to make a very entertaining wireless game that's well worth the download dollars.   Features:   3 play modes: Story, Free Skate, Tutorial  Multiple tricks  Variety of levels: Boston, Barcelona, Berlin, and more   THUG 2, as the game has come to be called, reminds us of those thumb-boarding things kids did a few years back with little toy boards. Using your thumbs, you must guide your skater around six different cities, launching him off of ramps and jumps, grinding on rails and environmental features, and causing all sorts of mayhem in an effort to fulfill goals set forth by perverse skateboarding puppet-master, Tony Hawk.   Solid control is essential for games like this to work. The reason the console games succeeded so wildly was that the controls were intuitive and effortless. With practice, pulling off multiple trick combos was incredibly easy and entertaining. And although the number of used buttons on a handset are far less than, say, and PlayStation 2 controller. JAMDAT has managed to make the controls for the mobile THUG 2 pretty easy to master. Basic control is handled with the touch pad, jumps are assigned to the ~OK~ button, and ~1~ and ~3~ are used for tricks.   Now, you cannot link together tricks like the PS2 version, aiming for massive million-point combos. But you can pull off a good number of classic skate tricks, like handplants, ollies, and manuals. The greater the trick, the more points you receive.   THUG 2 takes you across six different levels, from Boston to the ultimate thrash paradise of Skatopia. Along the way, you must collect items like cash and cellphones that often hover above certain jumps and grind targets. And you must always keep your eyes on the goals of the Hawk, such as breaking up environmental features and collecting certain items.   The level design in THUG 2 is exceptional. These levels are nowhere as large and complex as the console levels, but they offer multiple tiers of action. Complete side-scrollers, you can press up and down to move toward and away from the screen. Each one of these ~paths~ often has multiple jumps, rails, and ramps you can interact with. With several ~paths~ always on-screen, you'll soon appreciate just how much has been packed into these seemingly small levels.   THUG 2 is a pretty good looking game by today's standards, but we've certainly started to see games pull away. On the LG6000, the game's sprites have a decent amount of detail and the sprites are certainly colorful and defined. However, these Tony Hawk games are now starting to look alike, and we certainly note some similarities between THUG 2's overall looks and the visuals employed in JAMDAT's recent hit, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. Games as different as these deserve decidedly different art styles, but as it is, they all have heroes of the same size, similar color palettes, etc. This is not in any way meant to denigrate the obvious talent and hard work that JAMDAT puts into these games, but there is a definite need, as phones evolve, to start developing additional styles for such varied games.THUG 2 is an excellent addition to the series. Now, the average cellphone gamer looking for a simple distraction like a puzzler might be slightly put off by THUG 2. Unlocking levels and features demands a lot more attention than your basic action game. However, if you're looking for a cell game that offers multiple hours of play for your buck, then THUG 2 is a great investment. And if you're a junkie for the console series -- and sales figures prove there's a lot of you -- THUG 2 is the perfect companion piece, save for an actual skateboard and helmet. Highly recommended.", "date": "Oct 12, 2004"}
