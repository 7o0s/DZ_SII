EA Mobile's releasing a new edition of Scrabble for mobile, updated with a cleaner interface and visuals that expertly mimic the original board game. But is this version the best it can be? Or should you hold on to your download dollars for now?   For those who have never heard of it (listen up, you two), Scrabble is the game of wordplay in which each player receives seven tiles per move, with a letter printed on each tile.  Arrange your tiles on the board to form a word -- or, if you're savvy and want to rack up the points, multiple words in a single move.  The point value of each letter varies; vowels and common consonants like ~S~ are worth one point each, while less common and harder-to-use letters like ~Z~ and ~Q~ are worth a mint.  To beef things up, multicolored tiles on the board offer double or triple the point values.   Computer Scrabble is certainly nothing new.  But with the mobile version, you can play on the go, which guarantees a faster bus ride or wait in line at the movie theater.   While the mouse acts as your surrogate hand for laptop and desktop versions, the mobile version relies on the D-pad (or the 2, 4, 6, and 8 buttons) to move to the desired square on the game board.  Press the D-pad or the 5 key to select your square, then choose the letter from your seven tiles. It's all pretty basic, although the lack of a movable cursor slows the gameplay slightly.  Crossing from one end of the board to the other is more tedious in the mobile version than in any other Scrabble variation I've played, though this is a minor inconvenience at worst.   EA's Scrabble lets you select three different types of play: Versus Computer (relax, you can pick your level of difficulty), Pass'n Play (take your turn, then hand the phone to your friend so they can take theirs), and Solo (a fine primer for newbies, as you play against yourself -- everybody wins!).   When playing against the computer, you can choose one of four modes.  In the standard ~Classic~ version, the game continues until one player runs out of tiles.  Or set limitations of 75 points, 150 points, or 8 or 12 turns for shorter games.  There's even a Duplicate option that gives both players the same letters, effectively cancelling out the time-honored ~You got better letters than me!~ argument.   The gameplay is simple and fairly intuitive.  Longtime players will adjust almost instantly, and newcomers should find themselves getting the hang of things in only a few moves.  This being Scrabble, word freaks will likely be more entranced than those who are, shall we, verbally challenged -- but I haven't met the human being who wasn't sucked in by Scrabble.   That said, this version isn't perfect.   The only way to delete a word is to remove each tile from the board one at a time, which is a time-wasting bummer.  It would have been easy enough to allow a player to remove a whole word with one stroke of the unused number keys.  And if there is such a feature, I wasn't able to find it in regular gameplay or in the Help screens, which suggests it should be more accessible.   The major drawback, though, is the lack of an online component.  Pass and Play is nice when you've got a friend standing next to you, but how difficult would it have been to have enabled players to carry on a game, one move at a time, via an online connection?  I play ongoing Scrabble games at websites like Bug Cafe with several friends, and they do wonders to pass the time on a slow work day. This might have been a minor setback a year ago, but in context (EA Mobile recently released excellent online editions of Tetris and Bejeweled), it seems like criminal negligence to overlook an online component. Did no one in the office ever suggest adding what is quickly becoming an essential element for mobile games?  It's hard to go wrong with a venerable institution like Scrabble.  EA Mobile gets the basics just right: it looks, feels, and plays just like good ol' Scrabble.  I only wish I could play it with friends who aren't standing next to me.  Here's hoping the folks at EA Mobile correct this glaring oversight in a future version.", "date": "May 30, 2007"}
