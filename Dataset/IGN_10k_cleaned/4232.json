Madden 99 is a massive improvement over its predecessor, and in many ways it is a monumental game. It's huge. It's got the man (or 'Coach,' as he's informally known), a thick book of plays, and it's packed with a list of detail-oriented aspects, like a checklist of answers to gamers' expectations. It's clear that EA has listened to its fans and critics alike. Gameplay This year EA has brought in the One-button interface. Although this has been in the works for while at EA, Midway's NFL Blitz seems to have prompted both Sony and EA to address that game's fantastic arcade playability. The one-button interface enables gamers to simply skip though each menu and quickly get on with the game. In itself, it's great for those who simply want to get down and play. Compared to NFL Blitz, it's not as fun, as simple, or as quick.  The new Play Editor, always a great aspect to a football title, is solid and dependable. The plays don't vary that much from those provided, but you can mess with your defense or you friends just when they think they have got you down. This Play Editor is a great little devise that keeps the game more creative and more flexible.  On offense, a myriad of palatable new additions keep the game enjoyable. I'm not talking silly-crazy, or love at first site. I'm saying the additions are good. Jukes, head fakes, and QB pumps maintain a level of realism far above last year's model. Receivers jump for a catch, or they'll reach up and pull it down with one hand, a new level of detail that's clear in other areas of the game. Another nice little touch is that the receiver's head turns as he looks back to make the catch. The Arcade mode and Create a Player add a level of depth the overall game that also widen the game's availability. Motion and Animation Incorporating a mixture of both graphics and gameplay, character movement and animation is a new little area I've taken special care to include. With this year's war of videogame football reaching exceptionally fierce levels, each little detail of the game is being excruciatingly examined. I can clearly say that in Madden, I love how receivers dig their cleats in after a catch and pull defenders for extra yards, or how you can feel the crunch of a tailback's helmet as he charges through and breaks through a tackle. And what makes these actions feel so awesome are two-fold. First, the game's physics are brawny. The ball skips across the grass realistically, it spins like a real football; players smack into each other like real people do, and most of the time you can almost feel the pain and strain.  The other area in which Madden exceeds is in the animation department. Tiburon clearly went out of its way to makes the best set of excessively detailed animation sequences in football today. With more offensive and defensive animation sequences than Gameday, players will see little things that totally blow them away.   Credit is to be given to EA, because Madden 99 is far more realistic than last year's version. But physics aside, the actual synchonicity of these actions isn't so hot. Frankly, after playing just five minutes of 989 Studios' Gameday 99, it's clear that the smoothness of motion in Madden 99 just isn't in the same league as Gameday's. In other words, while individual sections of Madden are more realistic, the whole of Gameday's motion is better, faster, and more convincing.  With a decent frame rate, and a muddy, sludgy feel to the players' responsiveness, I'd be hard-pressed to say that Madden gives me that primal feeling of raw speed. It's good, but it's just above sluggish. Heck, players should respond faster and with more fluidity than this, especially with a massive sports team like EA on the project. Graphics Gone are the sprites. Gone are the little cruddy little v-poly players from yesteryear. The game is now polygonal, texture-mapped, and Gouraud-shaded, and players look pretty damn good.   Is it the best looking game out there? Hmm... The details are there. Uniforms wrinkle, crease, and highly detailed textures create a depth that's hard to match. Players are sharp looking, and moderately crisp. Madden 99 looks a lot better than it did last year, and they're better than NFL Extreme and EA's own NCAA Football 99. But is the game the best looking game on the block? No.   First, the N64 version of Madden looks a hell of a lot better (and it actually plays and move better, too), than the PlayStation version, a little gripe we're obligated to mention (being PlayStation guys!). And secondly, Gameday 99 is even sharper, crisper, and most of all, cleaner looking than Madden '99. Cleaner? Yeah! It's like each player had a better dry cleaner in Gameday than Madden. Sound Effects The level of realism in the sound effects are, as usual, great in this year's version. The tempo is exceptionally well paced, and when it really counts, especially if you're the home team, the roar of the crowd whales away, bringing you headlong into the moment of the game.   Other aspects of the game, such as full player and NFL licenses, all of the stadiums and teams, and the myriad of other options that one just expects of Madden, are there.  In the end, Madden is a serious football sim, no doubt. It's better looking, faster, deeper, and bigger than last year's game. But it's still not snatched back the gold that was once solely EA's. This year that crown goes to another game.  Douglass Perry", "date": "Aug 27, 1998"}
