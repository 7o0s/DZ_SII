Such edits were usually limited to highlighting changes in the alternate version, but in this case may have extended beyond the usual updates addressing additional console editions. Due to the age of the reviews, we cannot audit the edits and authorship and have replaced the altered copy with the original, PS2-specific copy.Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen, best known for their role on TV's gut-wrenchingly hilarious Full House, have recently turned 16 and acquired their driver's licenses. Although some states are implementing laws about talking on cell phones while driving in order to curb distractions, I don't believe there are any laws about staring at other drivers. Lawmakers may want to look into this in the near future. Anywho, since the lovely young ladies are now behind the wheel of thousands of pounds of steel, what better way to celebrate this than releasing another game based on them? So behold, Mary-Kate & Ashley Sweet 16: Licensed to Drive is the twins' newest game. GameplayMary-Kate & Ashley Sweet 16: Licensed to Drive is a party game targeted at their fans, and while those are the people who will most enjoy and probably love it, those who pick up the game with the right mindset will likely find the game entertaining for a bit. As with any party game worth its weight in plastic, there's quite a selection of minigames to play. You'll be able to take Mary-Kate, Ashley and two of their bespectacled friends surfing, off-road racing, wall climbing, on an exciting clothes chase, and more. This is a party game, which means that it's at its best when played with a group of gals during a slumber party, especially after an exhausting pillow fight. Even guys may find something to enjoy about this game while under those circumstances, though we were unable to set up such a situation by review time to fully give the game its chance to shine. Up to four people can play at once, though the computer will fill in nicely if you can't find enough people for a group session. The game offers a few different ways to play with either yourself or a group of your friends. The Adventure mode plays very similar to a board game. After spinning a dial each turn, your teen will drive herself a number of spaces and usually receive some sort of action. You may receive some coins for buying things, participate in a One-on-One challenge, or pick up friends for the ladies. At the end of each round, all four girls will play in one of the minigames, with points awarded for how well you are able to perform.  Aside from Adventure, there are also the Bring It On and Arcade modes. Bring It On will let you play a few randomly selected games, with the overall score between the rounds deciding who will end up dancing a jig. Arcade mode will let you play one round of the game of your choice.  Once nice thing about the game is that it's easy to pick up, even if it's your first time. Some of your friends might be a little hesitant to join a group session if they've never even gone at it with another person before, but don't let them be shy. Sometimes you'll get lost in the mix of who's who, and you may end up sticking it to one person when you may have meant to score on another, but everybody has fun in the end.  Most of the minigames are fairly easy, though one or two are actually quite difficult. Specifically, there's one where you have to match the pieces of a model car. You're shown a complete car first, and then piece-by-piece you have to match what they had first shown you. There are around six variations of each piece, and as it scrolls through the list, you need to press a button to select the correct piece. The list scrolls pretty quickly, so unless you've memorized the order of the parts, it's very hard to perfectly match the car. I suppose that's part of the challenge, but it's quite a bit more difficult than anything else in the game.  The better games are the ones that involve racing. They're pretty simplistic, but the vehicles control fairly well and everything moves at a reasonable pace. The other games pretty much depend on what mood you're in, or how much of a Mary-Kate & Ashley fan you are. The photo shoot game is OK, but it's not all that fun. If the mere idea of a few girls touching each other is exciting to you, then a game of Tag might be right up your alley. The office favorite has to be the clothes chasing game, though, since the idea is just filled to the brim with ludicrousness. Graphics The game is actually quite charming graphically. The game has a mostly cartoonish look to it, and the characters have a certain appeal that I can't quite put my finger on, though that could prove to be exciting if possible. The four girls are well defined and are reasonably animated, and the environments that the games take place in are decently represented. SoundThe game has almost zero sound effects. The mix is completely dominated by the music, though the young ladies will chime in during the minigames from time to time with quips like ~Gotcha!~ and ~Not again!~  The music fits the game and its intended audience well, but sadly, there aren't any tracks by Mary-Kate & Ashley themselves. They have quite a backlog of music, but there isn't any to be enjoyed in this particular game. Maybe it's exclusive to the next Grand Theft Auto game, but the Mary-Kate & Ashley license is never fully put to use without a plethora of their musical stylings. Mary-Kate & Ashley Sweet 16: Licensed to Drive can be a reasonably entertaining game if you can find a group of friends who come it at with the right mindset. All of the games are simple to play and some can be fun for a few rounds. As intended, though, this game is best suited for existing young fans of Mary-Kate & Ashley. Those lucky millions will probably enjoy this game a great deal, especially when they get together with a bunch of friends.", "date": "Nov 27, 2002"}
