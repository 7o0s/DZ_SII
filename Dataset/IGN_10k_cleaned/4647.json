Of course during our busiest of seasons, it's not really that unique of an occurrence, but it doesn't take away from the fact that we get an oh-so pleasant feeling each and every time that it happens. Such is the case with Namco's intense military shooter kill.switch; a futuristic polar opposite of popular titles like Splinter Cell and Metal Gear Solid.   Best described as a mix between the Guy Pierce motion picture Memento and a solo version of EA's Freedom Fighters, kill.switch has an interesting and compelling premise: that is, to take a one man commando and use him to start a devastating and all-encompassing global conflict. As you progress through the game's six missions and 15 different stages, more and more information about your rewired hi-tech soldier becomes available to you; presented through a bizarrely-directed flashback that reveals a longer piece of what really happened each time you see it. Needless to say, things are definitely not what they seem.   Gameplay  A shooter by every definition of the word, kill.switch appears to be pretty straightforward stuff. Given a simple objective at the start of each level, players must eliminate everything and anything that gets in their way. Along the path of destruction there are occasional blue spheres of light that you can move towards in order to advance the storyline or mission further. Whether its to plant a C4 explosive on the inside of an informational hub or to activate an elevator that takes you to the next section, it's these sorts of finish lines that serve as bookends between blasting everything that moves.    Because of the way it's setup, the mostly linear stage design almost always points you in the right direction towards finding these spheres; and getting lost or searching for the next objective rarely proves to be a problem. This kind of approach leaves the rest of the game open for players to go right ahead and focus on taking their opponents out by whatever means necessary, and keeps the pace of the action moving along at hurried speed.   What separates kill.switch from other uncomplicated gun-fests, however, is the importance of taking cover. Though we thought it to be somewhat gimmicky at first, it's the act of taking cover that saves your hide more than anything else. Hiding behind boxes, crouching below sofas, and peeking around walls are key to advancing your missions. As despite the fact that there are first-aid kits scattered throughout every area, relying on your firepower alone and hoping that your health bar can make it just doesn't get the job done. After all, a couple of shots from your enemy's AKU and you're dead meat. Luckily players can regain some heath if they manage to avoid being hit for long enough (ala Halo), but If they want to regain everything they'll need to track down one of the aforementioned first-aid kits.   It's with this philosophy that kill.switch proves how different it is from your typical shooting title. While most games of this sort allow you extra leeway when confronting a foe, kill.switch provides nothing of the sort. Standing flush in front of your opponent means almost immediate and certain death -- making the need for strategy (and to a limited extent, stealth) all the more important. This approach makes the experience infinitely more realistic and when you find yourself pinned down in crossfire with only your weapon and crude shelter to aid you, becomes unbelievably exciting. It's undeniable proof that being mortal has its entertainment values.   Since kill.switch is a shooter, there are eight different guns at your disposal -- each with their own use and practicality. Close-up position rushing, for example, benefits heavily from the application of the M1 12-gauge shotgun. While sneaking up on foes that are close to sounding an alarm is remedied best by the HK5-SD 9mm; a silenced sub-machine gun that makes less noise than any other tool in your arsenal. Additional firearms, like the AKUG Grenade Launcher and MCRT-300 Sniper Rifle provide for extra benefits in their various situations (though the AK47 and M4 Assault Rifle are good all-purpose weapons for commandos on the go), and we guarantee you that you'll find yourself in situations that require the use of all of them before all is said and done.    As an added benefit, players can use most of their weapons in a zoomed-in first-person mode as well. Making the stages where it's difficult to see your enemy amidst bullets and poor lighting a little bit easier. Other useful tools like the crouch button, jump button, and butt-attack (a close-quarters physical attack that utilizes the wooden end of your gun) give your character a little extra depth beyond the typical guy with a gun. Throw in his ability to use several types of grenades (flash and explosive) and you've got yourself one highly lethal assassin. The only hitch here is, that the PC rendition isn't quite as repsonsive as its console brothers when it comes to actually performing these moves (there's a bit of a delay).   Perhaps kill.switch's most appealing aspect, however, is how human the artificial intelligence is. Hinted at in normal mode but proven even more so on the hard setting, the CPU's reactions to your advancements are pretty damned cool. If one enemy recognizes that you're firing from behind the eastern most area of a line of boxes, for instance, he'll concentrate his fire on that section -- ordering his buddies to do the same when they approach. Not only does this make the game more difficult if you get pinned down, it also provides you with the opportunity to gain an advantage on their position. If you can get them to focus on one area of cover while you slink your way to another area, you can literally ambush them where they stand and get the one-up on then immediately. And yes, it plays out as fun as it sounds.   As cool as kill.switch may be, though, it does have its own share of problems. Despite its interesting (and shocking) plot twists and movie-like action sequences, it comes to an end after only five or six hour's time. And with little incentive to play through the experience again other than an additional difficulty level, it's hard to find a reason to go back unless you want to re-live that first experience all over again.   Also problematic were the noticeable camera issues that screwed up our dual analog targeting -- as there were quite a few occasions that saw us get smoked because the area of cover we chose created a skewed perspective that wouldn't allow us to aim where we wanted to. Finally, there isn't exactly a huge variety in enemies: as you'll face the same three or four different types of guys for the majority of your experience.    Difficulty nuts should love it though; as the latter sections of the game on ~hard~ can see some truly brutal confrontations between player and computer. Especially since it's not uncommon to find 10 or 12 enemies firing on you at once from various different flanking points. These types of situations certainly provide for high intensity moments of action and could be enough to lead you into forgetting about some of the previously mentioned problems. We know we did a couple of times.   Graphics  From a visual stanpoint, the PC version of kill.switch is almost identical to the console versions. Though the lighting effects are slightly better and the obvious resolution bump to 1024 helps quite a bit, the differences are really quite minimal. Regardless, whether it's the red hue of the alarms or the flash of lightning in a rainstorm, kill.switch does a great job of establishing atmosphere. Especially when it has a chance to show off all of its bullet tracers and map-damage. It's low system requirements are a plus too.   As we mentioned in the gameplay section, though, kill.switch isn't without its camera problems. Dependant on the position of your character in relation to the cover he's taking, the perspective will sometimes zoom too closely to an object or catch on an invisible snag making it impossible to aim at an oncoming target. Other occasional squabbles, like slowdown in the more inhabited areas, less than impressive level geometry, and basic textures used for obstacles serve as ingredients that do enough to get by, but not enough to impress.    Sound  When hooked up to a surround sound receiver, the audio in kill.switch is very impressive. Explosions, gunfire, and various other sound effects border on realistic and have a striking amount of bass and clarity. The voice acting is also of high caliber with typical tough guy motifs and a nice amount of banter that goes on between soldiers. And while your opponent's conversations don't branch out beyond a couple of sentences, the expletives and strategies they'll yell out during a firefight definitely up the cool factor quite a bit.   Better than most action movies, the soundtrack for kill.switch is also top-notch. Reactionary to the on-screen events, it will commonly move from a slow-paced stress-inducing horn beat to a straight-on disco rock ballad with the flip of a switch. Though some tracks are better than others (the tanker theme is really quite good), there isn't a weak song in the bunch and filmmakers should take note so they can lift some of it for one of next summer's blockbusters.There's a lot to like about kill.switch. As it's one of those types of experiences that's easy to pick-up, difficult in all the right places, and oozes Hollywood atmosphere without sacrificing too many gameplay convictions. While we can't say that we approve of its particularly short-sided length and occasional camera problems, it's still one hell of a fun ride while it lasts; especially if for fans of military excursions like Freedom Fighters and Conflict: Desert Storm.Ideally, the game may not have enough to warrant becoming a must-purchase title for gamers searching for long-term satisfaction. But for those of us looking for something a little less cookie-cutter in the shooting genre with a couple of hours to spare, then kill.switch is definitely attractive. And while the PC version isn't quite as reponsive as its console counterparts, it still warrants a look.", "date": "Apr 15, 2004"}
