While striving to grasp hold of the younger GBA crowd, Skyworks Technologies has released this compilation of five card games geared towards kids of all ages.  Sadly, this package is one of the worst additions to the Game Boy library to date:  A true achievement.  Kid's Cards includes five games:  Crazy 8's, Old Maid, Go Fish, War, and Slap Jack.     One of the greatest flaws in Kid's Cards begins with the product's packaging.  Kid's Card's box is littered with caricatures themed with each of the games from the compilation.  There is a cute psychotic eight-boy, a very old looking maid, a super-deformed fish, a borderline racy soldier, and a little boy named Jack who is no-doubt in for a good slapping.  While the package manages to appeal directly to kids with its block letters and chibi-art, the game most certainly doesn't.  There is more content made for kids on the actual box art than there is in the game.   The game begins with the title screen, and once start is pressed the only other interface will be found:  The Game Select Screen.  The interface for Kid's Cards can only be described as shameful, having plain text with a wallpaper backdrop.  There is no kid-friendly art, no block letters, and certainly no chibi-anything.  There is only plain text.     Once a game has been selected, the player will be able to tweak a few options for that particular game.  Unfortunately, the options are amazingly sparse, offering only Player Number for two of the games, and one added option for each of the other three.  Go Fish gives the option of ending or not ending when a player runs out of cards.  Crazy 8's allows the player to chose how many rounds to play, and War gives the option of changing the size of the war.  Aside from that there are literally no other options to be had.  Where is the ability to change names of computer players?  Where do players enter their own names for that matter?  There are dozens of options that could be included to give this title life. There are none to be found.   Once entering a game, another harsh realization comes into play:  Kid's Cards doesn't actually have any cards for kids.  The only deck available in the game is a standard 52 card deck.  There are no themes for the games as shown on the box, and the only difference between the five games are the backdrops used.  The presentation of this title manages to go downhill the second the box is opened.     Even though there are tons of problems with Kid's Cards, they could all be justified to a reasonable extent if the games were still a blast to play.  Unfortunately they aren't.  While every game holds true to the actual rules they contain, there is no advantage to playing it on a Game Boy instead of dropping a few bucks on a deck of cards.  There isn't even a skip button for computer turns or dealing intros.  In War for example, 52 cards are actually dealt to the players, and the game forces us to endure every single card. When the game is finished there is no fanfare to be found eiither.  ~Win~ or ~Lose~ comes up,followed by the pause screen with ~Resume~ disabled.  No over-the-top fanfare or ~You Win~ screen is to be found, but then again what kid would want that in their games?  I can't stress enough how basic and mindless this compilation is.  Any more time spent reading about this game would be a shame in itself.  There is simply nothing Kid's Cards has to offer the gaming industry, and is obviously a low-budget ploy to fill shelf space.  This game is a polar opposite to Ultimate Card Games for the GBA, which already contains both Go Fish and Crazy 8's, and should be avoided at all costs.  It is simply amazing that something as basic as War could be ruined.  Sadly it was.", "date": "Nov 23, 2005"}
