In reality, our secret origins encompass some of the most awful occupations known to man.   Aaron Boulding used to be a sleeper agent in the employ of the Marshall Islands, Hilary tried to make it big as a stripper in Las Vegas, and Guides guru Chris Carle is a former bouncer who spent years running from his conscience after ripping out a man's throat in a bar fight.   Me, I had the worst job of them all:  I used to work at an amusement park.  That's right, I spent two summers of my teenaged life flipping overpriced, greasy burgers and having my soul crushed at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.   It's the bitter ex-theme park employee in me that loved the original RollerCoaster Tycoon so very much.  Where else can you brutally torture idiot tourists and run a once-thriving business into the ground by spending all your money on life-size replicas of the pyramids?     An instant classic when it was released exactly four years, it's taken RollerCoaster Tycoon a shockingly long time to make the leap to consoles.  Was Infogrames taking it's time, carefully crafting a product that would live up to the legacy of its PC predecessor while taking advantage of the superior Xbox hardware?   In a word, no.   The Xbox version of RollerCoaster Tycoon is a carbon copy of the ancient PC game, down to the smallest detail.  As such, the game retains much of the original's charm, but it suffers from a number of console-specific problems, namely the lower resolution of television screens and an awkward control system.   Gameplay   For both of you who've never played it, RollerCoaster Tycoon is a simulation game along the lines of Theme Park or Sim City.  You're given a plot of land, a few thousand dollars in capital, and told to build a thriving amusement park.     A relatively deep game, there's plenty of stuff to keep track of.  Not only are you responsible for designing the layout of ~Justopia~ (Well, that's what I always call my parks...), you've also got to hire employees, monitor the guests' moods and watch your finances.   The sheer amount of ways that you can tinker with your park is staggering.  You can change the color scheme of just about anything in the park, choose from a variety of themes and even tweak the style of music that each individual ride plays.  From a financial standpoint, you can adjust ride and admission prices, set the amount of money that goes to research, and even pay for advertising campaigns for the park.  With so much customization, you'll find yourself quickly becoming attached to your unique creations.   When designing your park, you've got to take into account some rather pragmatic considerations.  Food stall placement, for example, can be a tricky affair.  You don't want to put them near the front of the park, because guests haven't worked up an appetite.  You also want to avoid placing them near rides with a high nausea factor, or people will buy food, go on a ride, and then puke all over your sidewalk.  Just like in real life.   The people who visit your park have some of the least intelligent AI imaginable.  They easily become lost, eat themselves sick and spend most of their time whining about how they want to go home.  Obviously the folks at developer Chris Sawyer spent countless months observing the habits of real tourists.   Luckily, you're not only the park owner; you're also the thought police.  Clicking on any guest brings up a menu from which you can view their most recent thoughts.  While most of the time they'll think things like ~I want to go home~ or ~I haven't finished eating my ice cream cone,~ you can occasionally glean a piece of useful information or two from them.  For example, if multiple people think that Roller Coaster #1 is a really good value, it might be time to jack up the price.      The feature that sets RollerCoaster Tycoon apart from other sim games is the full-featured ride editor.  Piece by piece, you can craft the rollercoaster of your dreams, limited only by your funds.  Do you want an underground coaster that burrows under your entire park?  It can be done.  Would you rather build a physics-defying coaster of doom that will push enough G's to make your passengers pass out?  Go for it, just don't expect very many people to ride it.   If you're like me, you'll spend far more time thinking up elaborate death traps for your guests than you will designing the perfect coaster.  As far as I'm concerned, the ability to brutally torture your guests is the greatest thing about this game.  Sure it may not make for a fiscally viable park, but hot damn is it fun.     There's nothing quite as satisfying as digging a huge pit in the middle of a path and dropping anybody who thinks ill of your park in as an example to the rest.  Wait, I take that back. Blocking the exit to your park and proceeding to shut down all the bathrooms and food stalls is really fun too.   The possibilities are endless.   As much fun as the game is, RollerCoaster Tycoon isn't without issues.  The biggest of these problems lie in the controls.  This is a game that's meant to be played with a mouse and keyboard.  Instead, you're forced to bring up menus by holding down a button, moving to the action you want with the d-pad, and releasing the button.  It's pretty cumbersome.      To make matters worse, every time you do anything you open up a Windows-style window that clogs up the screen.  In order to get rid of it, you have to drag the painfully slow cursor to the box and hit the black button.  It may not sound too bad on paper, but you'll find yourself spending way too much time just moving around and deleting windows.   Graphics    If there's an area in which RollerCoaster Tycoon really disappoints, it's the graphics.  This game wasn't particularly visually impressive back in 1999, and it looks the exact same here.  As such, this is probably the worst looking game on Xbox.     Even at the closest zoom level, rides appear distant and lack detail, with people appearing as little more than walking blobs of color.  Hills are angular, roads turn at 90-degree angles, and water is little more than a light blue texture that sparkles a little.   You know what, I want to take my previous statement back.  The Xbox version actually looks worse than its PC counterpart, thanks to the drop in resolution from computer monitor to TV.  While Infogrames makes a half-hearted attempt to address the issue by including a magnifying glass that increases the zoom level a bit, it doesn't really solve the problem.     For example, when building a coaster little icons appear that tell you the height of each section of track.  This information is pretty important, since you've got to know the elevation of each piece of track if you're going to build another section of track over or under it.  On my 20-inch television at home, I couldn't make out those elevation numbers for the life of me.  Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.   Sound   RollerCoaster Tycoon's sound gets the job done, but just barely.     Crowd noises are pretty well done, with screaming at appropriate times on the thrill rides, intermittent laughing, and applause whenever you complete a scenario.  It adds to the amusement park feel, but it's nothing elaborate.   The same can be said of the game's music.  The ability to select different music for each ride and being able to hear each track is amusing, at least for a little while, but none of the tunes are particularly memorable.  You know, this would have been a really great opportunity for creative use of custom soundtracks, but alas, such is not the case.    Despite it's age, RollerCoaster Tycoon remains one of the most entertaining simulation games on the market.  The learning curve can be a bit steep, but once you've mastered the basics, you may never stop playing.  Nevertheless, I can't recommend this version of this game.  Infogrames has offered gamers absolutely no reason to choose the console iteration over the PC original. Should you own a copy of RollerCoaster Tycoon?  If you're into the sim genre, then absolutely.  Just don't buy it for the Xbox.  Instead, I suggest that you pick up the PC title.  If you're reading this, your computer should be able to run the thing fine.  With far inferior controls and embarrassing graphical issues, the Xbox version simply can't compete.If for some strange reason you don't have access to a PC, but you're still reading this, bump the final score up a couple points.", "date": "Apr 1, 2003"}
