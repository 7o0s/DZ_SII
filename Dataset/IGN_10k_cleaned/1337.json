Usually, when the rights to develop a game to from one company to the other, the code does not follow, and the decision is made that radical changes are necessary.  Of course, the data that helps make the game, such as 3D track models, often does move over, because of the sheer amount of effort it takes to create them.  Ultimately, it's interesting to see what a new developer can bring to an old series.   Just judging from the specs of the game, not much has changed.  Exactly one new track has been added, and that is Daytona.  So, yeah, welcome back Daytona, finally pried away from Sega's ~exclusive license~ clutches (they just made arcade titles that had almost NOTHING to do with real stock car racing, let alone Daytona Speedway).  I still want to know why after all this time Dover Downs and Louden aren't in the game.  Surely EA has had enough time to license them.  But instead they did give us some fantasy speedways, which are a blend of road course turns and oval bankings.  A NASCAR purist couldn't care less, but casual gamers might be happy to know they can do something besides turn left all the time.  And you still get quite a few tracks, so you can run some nice long seasons.   Another change is that you now get 18 cars to race with instead of 16.  If you were expecting 43, you're expecting a Playstation miracle that is just not going to happen.  Maybe we'll see it in the PS2 version, but not on the Playstation.  And even with 18 cars on the track, don't expect extraordinary frame rates or even consistently high.  Again, there's just too much to draw most of the time.  However, this year's title does a good job at keeping the game playable and not slowing the game down too much.  Of course, it helps if you drive from bumper cam instead of in-car, and don't use mirrors, but those are your choices.   One of the biggest in-car changes is that EA decided to let the road kick you around in the car.  It's kind of hard to focus on things as the cockpit jumps and stutters around you as you race across the surfaces that are only smooth at 50 mph!  This can be a little disconcerting, but switching to other views eliminates it (external cams) or minimizes it (bumper cam).   The car models are not going to compete with Gran Turismo cars, but the paint jobs are nice and for the most part, accurate, reflecting this year's paint schemes.  The wheels spin and turn in their wheel wells, and you can see it when your car gets banged up.  From outside the car, you can see into the car enough to make out the driver and the crossbar a little bit.  It's not fantastic, but it is sure better than opaque windows that used to be used in so many Playstation racers.  Perhaps EA's Need For Speed series finally broke that barrier down for good.   Another graphical change is that instead of using the same old circular lens flare pattern, EA actually washes out the exterior surroundings as you turn towards the sun.  So the sun feels more realistically 'blinding' and less like a telescope of rings aimed in at your car.  It's nice to see this little preview of what we might see on the PS2 version.  And EA continues to provide split time overlays, a draft meter to show you how much of a tow you're getting from the car ahead of you, and a damage overlay.   Pitting is done on autopilot, with an animated pit crew working on your car, and you can change a few things in your car.  You also get to squeeze your own gas!  Just hold down the L2 button and you see the guy materialize with the gas jug, and a bar shows your fuel rising.  Unfortunately, because this is just a bar, you don't know just how much is enough.  If you've gone through a fuel run at least once, you should have an idea, though, how many laps you got for a full tank, and estimate as close as you can when to stop fueling.  Of course, if you're changing all four tires it probably doesn't matter and you can fuel it all the way up.  But if you're trying to get out ahead of where you came in with a splash 'n go stop, you can now control it.   The sound is expected to work WITH the graphics to help you drive the car.  Mostly, I look for the tires to squeal in accordance with the level of stress they are under, with the most violent and annoying squeals saved for when you're merely a passenger in a completely sliding or spinning car.  The sounds aren't fantastic here, and they've never been in this series.  However, there was enough between the graphics and what sound they put in to help me correct my driving mistakes while they were still small.  The sound of the stock car engines is also excellent overall, though I always wish it would hit my subwoofer with more power.  I've heard these cars in real life and they pack a wallop across your range of hearing!   There are also annoying announcers who are, well, annoying.  Listen to them until you've heard what they have to say more than twice and then shut them off.  The same goes for the music.  Of course, I'm biased against music in any kind of racing game.  The engine should be your music and the tire shrieks your car singing to you.  And considering the wide range of tastes out there, chances are you're going to prefer your own kind of music to race to anyway, and there are a number of other ways to solve THAT problem!   The one guy who really matters is your spotter, particularly if you're so fond of your frame rate you'd rather not have a mirror.  Your spotter should be calling out things like ~Car high~, ~Car low~, ~Clear high~, ~Clear low~, ~Stay low~, and ~Still there~.  Well, he's in the game, but he's often distracted from his job.  Sometimes he's late, sometimes he says nothing at all!  But given the fact that this is not a pack racer (where you spend lap after lap inside a 10-car sandwich), it's not too bad.  If you're only dealing with a car or two at a time, as is the case when you only have 18 cars stretching out across the whole track, you should be able to judge how to pass, and it doesn't hurt to turn your mirrors on when the traffic thins out anyway.  Between the spotter, the mirrors and good ole common sense you should be able to get by.  I do wish that the spotter had been done better, however.  Perhaps we'll get more consistency in the next version (if they do another PS One version).   The other voice you get is your crew chief who'll make miscellaneous helpful comments, and the ones that are most important are when you should pit for tires and fuel.   I think one of the most positive aspects of playing this game has to be the fact that the garage tune-ups are integrated with the on-track section of the game.  So unlike most racers where you have to exit to a 'garage' and tweak your car, then endure the painful reload of the track, here you can make your change to the car within a simple slider based interface which pops up at a command.  This lets you improve your car and test out new ideas in a way that doesn't bog down gameplay.  That's priceless in any kind of CD-based racer that needs to involve load time for a track.  Load times discourage experimentation, and only seat time and lots of tweaks can help you customize the car to your liking.   In fact, I discovered that the default car at one track had a serious push and I was able to tweak my way out of the push before race time.  It didn't improve my time a lot, but it DID make the car driveable and safe, and allowed me to race competitively.  With most PSX racers of this game, I don't bother and just make do with the default.  Life is too short to endure a load time just to add a pound of air pressure to one of the wheels!   As far as the physics model of the cars go, well, let's not put this into the ~serious sim~ category yet, but they are better.  As usual the cars are a little more grippy than they are in real life.  My main test of this is to see what my speed is mid-corner at Martinsville.  If I can do 80 around it, there's too much grip.  But I'm sure that keeps the game more approachable to novices, as they don't have to brake as hard.   If there is a concern with the game it is that it might not be hard enough for many people to find challenging.  I'm not the best racer in the world.  I'd say on a scale of 1-10 in sim racing my laps are at around a 7 or maybe an 8 when I really try.  But the people who are really good at these things are going to find the game not to be challenging.  I was able to win a close race at Martinsville my first time out even with little practice, and this was at the highest difficulty level.  At the middle difficulty level, even my mistakes couldn't keep it from being a blowout.  If you're hardcore and you KNOW you're really good at these games, this one might be too much of a cakewalk, even if you like NASCAR sims.   But let's just assume you're an average gamer looking for a solid racing game, or maybe you can put together a fast lap, but not consistently over a race (so you tend to pass 3 cars, then make a mistake and lose 3-5 positions!).  You'll find this racer more interesting as a result.   One of the other nice features for the casual gamer is that you don't have to just race a Winston Cup season.  You can race just the speedways, just the road courses, just half a season, just the short tracks, and so on.  And you can determine race distance.  So there's some customization abilities there for you to race the season you want on the tracks you want and not have to tolerate tracks you hate.   Replays of the race are only available as a non-user controllable TV style replay clip of your best moments of the race.  First your car is shown during those moments, then the 2nd place finisher is shown during those moments.  You don't have any other control than that.  I do like this game, but it really best suited for an average gamer who likes NASCAR and wants the racing not to be TOO real.  It is the best of the series so far but for the medium challenge level.  And diehard sim addicts would be a bit disappointed with the higher than realistic grip levels.", "date": "Oct 13, 2000"}
