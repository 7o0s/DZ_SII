And why not, the company put together one of the top GBA titles with its Castlevania: Circle of the Moon development. The latest revival of classic Konami is its shooter series Gradius, and like Castlevania on the system, Gradius Galaxies is an original design based on the series, keeping faithful to the look and feel that made the series popular in the past. And while there's nothing terribly wrong with the overall package, Gradius Galaxies does suffer from slightly brain-dead gameplay and a short adventure that's made even shorter thanks to infinite continues and a battery save. Features Eight levels 14 different weapons Battery save Only for Game Boy Advance  Gradius has been released for nearly every system in existence, and the Game Boy Advance continues the series without mucking up its tried-and-true shooter design. The game puts shooter fans to the test of blasting through eight different planetary areas. To help them along the way, power-up icons appear after shooting certain enemies, and when collected, each one advances the power-up indicator at the bottom of screen. Players can choose to activate the current highlighted power, or keep collecting icons until the indicator moves to the power they think they'll need.  When the Super NES version of Gradius III, Konami used the system to the game's advantage, showing off what the hardware can do...horrible slowdown aside. It's the same deal with Gradius Galaxies, as many of the levels push the GBA's hardware showing off rotating enemies and objects, transparent backgrounds, and digitized voices throughout the action...all without any of the slowdown that plagued previous versions of the series. The designers even get cute with the popular Konami code that was made famous by the NES version. Folks who enter in the familiar command during the game are rewarded with all weapons and power-ups...but only for three seconds as their ship self-destructs. (The true ~all weapons~ code can be activated with a slight variation of this command string). Konami obviously learned their lesson with the GBA's lighting problem from its contrast mistake with Castlevania,  as Gradius Galaxies is much brighter to see overall...despite taking place in the blackness of space, all the tiny hazardous and helpful sprites can be seen in normal lighting. And thankfully the designers added a rapid-fire mode to the game -- it's not like you can add a controller with rapid-fire to the GBA, so they added it to the options menu if you want it.   Other cool features include the game's ability to save high scores to cartridge. And since there's a battery involved, the game will also allow players to return to any sub-level that's been completed...which means players can continue the game before the last level just to pick up a few power-ups to assist them in the level they screwed up. Gradius Galaxies is definitely a challenging and action-packed title, but it's definitely not without issues. The graphics, while definitely using the GBA's hardware to good use, isn't really advancing the series in its look -- Mobile 21 kept the game looking extremely close to the classic versions, so sprites and backgrounds don't exactly leap off the LCD screen. The audio is definitely a step backwards from Konami's previous efforts, especially compared to Castlevania...the tunes barely sound better than NES and Game Boy music. And while it seems like a good thing that the game features battery save, it hurts the challenge of Gradius Galaxies since players can jump right to the last level reached whenever they want...with infinite continues to boot. Eight levels can only go so far, and a skilled player can blast through this game in an hour or two. Of course, there's the matter of playing through at a higher difficulty next time, but the incentive isn't there since it doesn't offer anything really different at the end.     Classic revivals are always welcome on the Game Boy Advance, and Gradius Galaxies is honestly a good one. It's certainly not perfect, and the gameplay is admittedly a bit shallow since all that's really involved is blasting enemies and maneuvering around objects and sprites...reaching a boss at the end of a level that just needs a few bullets in the same spot to destroy it. But it works as a casual handheld game -- I wouldn't rate the game very high as a current console title, but as a GBA game it's a good one to pull out and put away in quick bursts of gaming.", "date": "Nov 29, 2001"}
