{"name": "Let's Ride!", "name_review": "Let's Ride", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/28/lets-ride", "text": "Sometimes I wonder why I put up with this crap.  First, I get stuck reviewing every lame ass product that can be dredged up from the bowels of the software industry.  Then, to rub salt in the wound, I'm passed over for promotion in favor of a talking pickle.  Being assigned to cover a horse and pony grooming and riding simulation is the straw that broke the camel's back.  Yuk it up while you can, readers.  When I start to wear high heels, begin talking like Barry White, and develop a taste for human livers, don't say I didn't warn you.  Ahem.  Oh...uh..yes...the review.  So you've passed up our coverage of Shogun, Starship Troopers and Vampire in favor of Let's Ride, eh?  My, you're a manly man, seeking info on what is perhaps the world's most comprehensive 'horsey' game to date.  Confronted with the unassuming box shot depicting a young woman with a big, fat grin on her face riding at full canter towards you, who wouldn't be suckered into a purchase?  Any normal punter that isn't screwed up in the head, that's who.  Entering Greenfield Riding Club, it's necessary to sign in at the front desk.  Following a brief conversation with the attendant, you're faced with a tough choice.  Hmm, do we go to the clubhouse and play a game of trivia and write in our diary, or head back to the stables to play with the horsies?  Horsies it is, then.  A dozen horses are on display, lounging around waiting to be groomed and rode.  Visitors to their stalls can comb and brush them or saddle the beasts up and sign up for training lessons or enter a competition.  Training lessons come in the form of speech clips accompanied by text descriptions and a single, tiny picture.  Prepubescent females will be giggling with delight as they learn how to ride the gentle creatures.  The rest of us will be groaning and hanging our heads in shame.  Competitions are a minor step in the right direction, since they're essentially made up of three arcade style games.  To win at show jumping, you'll use the arrows keys to work up speed and the space bar to hop over fences and brick barriers in a set order.  Dressage, otherwise known as the art of parading about like a jackass, tests your ability to control the animal.  If pomp and circumstance don't do it for you, try the 3D, first person view cross-country races.  Sad as it is to have to admit it, I found the contests to be difficult and pointless.  But then again, there's probably a three year old girl out there than can bend me over on this one.  Last year's crop of kiddie titles looks like a lost stash of Renoirs compared to this drivel.  Cartoons are used to depict characters, horses, and background, and while the visuals aren't grotesque, they're grossly outdated.  The 3D events look considerably better, but are filled with pixelated, blocky effects and terrain due to the software engine employed.  Feminine voices attack you wherever you go, so keep your trigger finger locked on IGN for Men when those estrogen levels start to rise.  Let's Ride is adorable, pleasant and not worth a flying flip if you've got a Y chromosome.  -- Scott Steinberg", "date": "Jun 28, 2000"}
