Either they're games that wow us with an impressive little 3D engine, or they're games that show a full understanding of the limitations of the device and concentrate on solid 2D gaming instead. We can't remember the last game we saw which excelled in both of these areas.  Features:  3D objects mixed with 2D gameplay 3 ships and 3 difficulty levels Difficulty-specific high score tables 5 exciting levels and 3 bosses  Continuing what they began with their impressive GBA racer 'Karnaaj Rally', which received an 8.8 a year ago on IGN Pocket, development house Infinite Dreams has again thrown together an impressive mix of 2D gameplay with 3D effects. But whereas Rally took on the overhead racing genre, their new titles 'Sky Force' is essentially a suped-up up '1943' for the new millennium.  In the game, you pick one of three ships (balanced between speed and shield strength) and fly around, blowing up everything in your site. The island backdrops are bright and colorful, and cloud and water effects really immerse you in the title. What really makes the title stand out, however are the little details and 3D aspects the developers have included in the game. Ships don't just zig and zag rigidly, they swerve along the ocean leaving a convincing wake behind them. Likewise the fighter jets you encounter twirl about like a deadly flock of synchronized swimmers. And the weather engulfs you.  Large objects below you such as light houses and towers are actually basic 3D models that angle themselves as you fly by, similar to the approach used in Karnaaj Rally (and yes, you can blow them up). This gives the game incredible depth that would otherwise be lacking in a flat, 2D-only title. The explosions in this game are gorgeous, too. When you destroy an enemy, particularly the larger ones, you don't get that average little smoke puff you might expect in a cell game. Instead you're treated to wild bursts of flames shooting out in several directions with the aide of some impressive transparency and particle effects. Some of the firepower in the game is similarly impressive, with smokey paths trailing your missiles.  Regarding gameplay itself, the game doesn't innovate but it's still a solid little overhead shooter. Bullets move slowly enough to dodge, and shooting down an entire string of enemies will usually net you a powerup, changing your primary weapon to stronger blasts or a double-shot. You can also earn a 'big bomb' attack, which varies depending on the powerups you collect (the fat laser beam blasts through enemies in a single bursts, and you can really feel the impact it has on the larger enemies). Most of the game has you shooting down little gnat-like planes, destroying bases on the ground below or taking out components of a larger enemy (like gun turrets on a carrier). Through the five levels, you'll also encounter a few bosses, and should keep a lookout for people to rescue on the ground (who if you're not careful, can also be shot).  Sound is impressive across the board. Considering what a throw-away category this has been with most wireless games, it's nice to see a game that features some pulsing tunes and sound effects that match the visual quality of the explosions. Menus are easy to navigate through, and in fact the entire game is very intuitive. Anyone can pick up this title and be rocking within a few seconds.   The game however is not perfect. You're limited to 4-directional movement, whether you use your keypad or directional buttons, so dodging some hairy situations can get a little frustrating. The people you have to pick up on the ground, too are so small that they're easily lost in the battle; most games, we ended up unintentionally shooting more of my friends than we saved. And in fact the whole idea of rescuing people doesn't seem to match the frantic shooting of the rest of the title. Fortunately, your performance here also won't prohibit you from continuing on (games where you die just because a few of your friends get capped have always been a pet peeve of mine). The bosses aren't particularly inventive. Larger than the common enemy, all they've really got going for them is size. Maybe I'm getting greedy, but we'd love to see Infinite Dreams follow this game up with a shooter that was just as impressive with regard to gameplay, as it was to audio-visuals. Put simply, Sky Force is amazing. If you were ever a fan of games like '1943', there's no reason you should pass this game up. At $10 it's a bit pricey for a wireless title, but considering it shames most $30 GBA games, it's more than worth the bucks. The game is pretty short; There are no continues so the replay value comes from getting skilled enough to beat the game on hard all the way through. Start to finish it probably won't take you more than fifteen minutes, but it's the best 15 minutes you'll spend on your phone outside of calling 976 numbers.
