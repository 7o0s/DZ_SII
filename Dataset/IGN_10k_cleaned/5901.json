Their operations were centered on uprooting General Mohamed Farrah Aidid, a militia leader responsible for earlier attacks on Pakistani troops delivering food to the region. On a mission to capture Aidid's lieutenants, two American Black Hawks were downed and 18 American soldiers were killed. The events were highly publicized and sparked fierce arguments over the reasons behind the mission and its political implications. In 1999, Mark Bowden published the novel Black Hawk Down that was later turned into a feature film.   All of this back story brings us to 2003, when Novalogic launched the PC title Delta Force: Black Hawk Down. The game didn't directly focus on the historic chopper crash, but immersed players in the chaos of Mogadishu and the events leading up to the confrontation. The game featured crowded environments packed with enemies, bridging the gap between tactical combat and balls out firefight. Two years later the title has made the leap to Xbox, boasting a similar multiplayer campaign and 50 player online matches. The result is a mix of average gameplay, slightly outdated visuals, and a few winning moments.    Black Hawk Down opens with the option to select a player profile that is persistent in the campaign and multiplayer modes of the game. There are four separate classes to choose from including assault, close quarters combat, sniper, and medic. While the classes will heavily influence a player's tactics in the multiplayer mode, it doesn't make as much sense in the campaign. There is very little incentive to play the action oriented campaign missions as anything other than an assault expert. While snipers are able to keep their distance on more open levels there are a large number of urban confrontations that force the fight to become up close and personal.    There are 16 missions in the single player campaign, each with multiple objectives that often change as the story plays out. While BHD has a deep back story in an original setting, it does little to personalize the experience. Players assume the role of a killing machine with specific instructions: keep your head down, avoid civilian casualties, and take down as many hostiles as possible. This is no Brothers in Arms with moments of mushy reflection. BHD is all about kicking ass, not making friends with the other troops.    A typical mission pits players against large crowds of menacing Somalians, mixed in with helpless civilians. Your opponents are well armed but poorly organized, making many confrontations feel like being thrown into the middle of a hellish street riot. Many levels also contain a rail shooting element where players man high powered guns mounted on either a humvee or the side of a chopper. Mowing down huge numbers of enemies can be exhilarating, but due to guns with infinite ammo that don't overheat, the player is almost invincible in these situations.    The main flaw with the console version of the single player game is that it was designed to be a precision shooter on the PC. Players will often find themselves aiming at tiny specs on the horizon. Also, those same tiny specs can end a mission with just a few shots. This is fine for the Sniper Class, but other specialists will grow accustomed to looking for the small green bounding box that appears when auto-aim kicks in instead of trying to spot an actual person in the distance.      Players are often accompanied by two or three teammates controlled by a somewhat competent AI. They'll usually keep themselves out of trouble, but don't expect too much help when storming a building. There are also eight team commands that can either be selected from a clunky in-game menu or spoken into the Xbox Communicator and then confirmed with the press of a button. The voice recognition works well most of the time, and the required confirmation means that allies won't storm a room when they're ordered to hold a position. Controlling a team should add a layer of strategy to the combat, but for the most part it can be completely ignored without adversely affecting the gameplay.    Control wise, soldiers have movement options befitting of a Special Forces team member. Players can kneel, lay prone, roll, jump, lean, and use binoculars at any point. I could not find one instance in the single player campaign where rolling worked to my advantage, but you'll need every trick in the book to avoid death in the huge multiplayer matches. Rainbow Six veterans will have an immediate dislike for the control layout, and will have to make the adjustment because the options only allow you to invert the look and change handedness. If you can't deal with crouch being mapped to the D-pad, too bad.     Visually, BHD reveals itself to be a two year old PC port. I appreciate the large scale environments but the textures are often muddy and the desert feels a little toodesolate. The game could really benefit from some tighter graphics and environments that suffer from the destruction of battle. Most of the structures in Somalia look as though they would collapse under a gentle breeze, so it's off-putting when they deflect a rocket attack. On the up side, the game supports 480p and benefits greatly from the higher resolution. What was previously muddy becomes crisp. The game still shows its age, but upping the displayed resolution certainly makes a difference.    The game features a generic library of sounds for a military shooter. Get used to hearing the buzz of flies and the nondescript sound of gunfire erupting from no particular direction. My biggest complaint concerning the sound is that, on a large multiplayer map, the sounds of battle offer almost no indication as to their whereabouts. A shot from across the map sounds pretty much the same as direct hit with a grenade.   Delta Force: Multiplayer  Enough about the campaign, the real meat of Delta Force resides in the multiplayer experience. The game contains four player split screen co-op, deathmatch, and best of all: up to 50 people can go head-to-head on Xbox Live on Novalogic servers. Individual players can host up to 32 people, which is still quite the party.     These days split-screen mode is too often pushed aside in favor of online functionality, so it's nice to see the four player option available. Unfortunately, my earlier complaint concerning the scale of enemies is only made worse on the smaller screens. It can be painstakingly difficult to see enemies in co-op, and the versus mode will have players pressing their foreheads to the screen to get the first glimpse of an enemy popping around the corner. Co-op mode consists of the 6 most exciting campaign missions and versus mode comes with nine maps designed for four player fun.      The first order of business with any online game is simple functionality. I am happy to report that in our time with Delta Force, logging on and finding a game with a decent connection was a snap. As of this posting a quickmatch search speedily led to 16 games hosted by one of Novalogic's data centers, and a slew of player hosted games.   Game types include Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Team King of The Hill, Search & Destroy, Attack & Defend, Capture the Flag, and Flag Ball. All of the online standbys are present including quickmatch, optimatch, teams, statistics, recent players, and create a match. Novalogic has stated that they have a never-ending supply of content from the PC community and it can be made ready for download at short notice. So the huge assortment of maps (which are specific to game types) may increase in the future.    The success of BHD's online mode has to do with its class system. In Team Deathmatch, more points are awarded for advanced tactics like medic saves, knife kills, and headshots. A diverse group of soldiers working together will take out disorganized yahoos every time. On the downside, the only vehicles are on the larger maps and they move on rails and are completely indestructible. This means that players can hop into a chopper and enjoy the ride, but have no control over where it flies or lands. You can shoot a player off the back of a Humvee, but destroying the actual vehicle is not an option.    The lack of vehicles was one of the biggest complaints over BHD when it was released over two years ago and the lack of this feature has only become more prevalent. The large maps contain some impressive cityscapes, but when the only method of quick travel is a monorail, or captured spawn point, players end up taking some long hikes.     Black Hawk Down was first released on the PC in 2003. Back then it was an impressive conglomeration of large scale environments and seemingly epic confrontations, but time has not been kind to Delta Force. In the past two years we've seen the rapid evolution of military combat shooters, with each consecutive attempt bringing something new to the table. Be it heart pounding action events, a tear jerking storyline, or a varied arsenal of weapons and vehicles, each addition to the genre raises our expectation in terms of what a title such as this one should include. With all of the recent advancements, Black Hawk Down feels a tad shallow. It isn't a bad game by any means, but after a good stretch of shooting people in the face, players will find themselves wanting something more. In terms of team shooters, this game lacks the tight controls and presentation of the Rainbow Six titles but offers a little more in the strategy department than say Ghost Recon. If you can look past the dated presentation, and are intrigued by the big team battles, then this game offers up some fun, at least for a little while.", "date": "Jul 28, 2005"}
