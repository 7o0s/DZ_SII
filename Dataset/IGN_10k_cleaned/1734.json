You're basically relying on: (1) a big portion of those that own the peripheral to buy the game or (2) make the game attractive enough to interest consumers in buying the peripheral AND the game.  Numero 2 is, by far, much harder to accomplish, as demonstrated by Samba De Amigo.  Oh sure, you can say you don't NEED the Dreamcast Maracas to play Samaba De Amigo... but we know you really do, and to ask someone to shell out money for both the game AND peripheral - that's asking a lot.  But of course, it's worth spending extra dough for the Maracas and Samba De Amigo, cuz the game IS that good.  This reasoning is the same for Typing of the Dead, even if it is a typing game.  Yes, I know many of you are cringing from sudden flashbacks of that wispy, typing teacher from your freshman high school typing class, wacking your desk with that yard-long wooden stick to keep you awake.  Or you're thinking to yourself, ~typing? That's for freakin' secretaries and geeks.~  But let me explain why this game is simply genius.  Developed by those smarties at Smilebit, the ingenuity of Typing of the Dead is an answer to how skill is developed when playing video games.  It's not a bold statement to say that most games today require little gaming skill and those that do are quite difficult to master for the casual gamer.  I don't know how many times I've had to explain the exact instructions of the classic ~quarter circle forward~ motion in fighting games, the mechanics of a ~rocket jump~ in Quake II, how to ~rope vertically~ with the ninja rope in Worms Armageddon, or a ~weapon cancel~ in Virtual On: Oratorio Tangram.  Though some of these mechanics aren't really that hard to learn, to actually implement such techniques in the midst of gameplay takes a lot time and practice, and to many out there, it's just not worth the trouble.  The brilliance that is Typing of the Dead  takes a skill that many of us are already either familiar with or proficient in - typing.  From there, the game builds upon what makes typing so challenging  precision, speed, and reflexes  into something that is very addicting and, believe it or not, very fun.  Taking the storyline of House of the Dead 2 you play one of the agents trying to rid the infestation of undead monsters and mutated beasts in the city.  As the title of the game implies, you ~type~ certain words or phrases that appear over enemy's heads in order to kill them.  The game begins very simply with two-four letter words, though once you get to the bosses, you'll be typing at least 36 character phrases.  Sounds easy?  Not really, especially when a swarm of zombies come lurching towards you with all sorts of wacky and weird phrases.  Thankfully, should you choose the wrong enemy to start typing, when a closer foe is about to attack you, you can abort the current target by pressing ~ESC~ and start the typing on a different zombie.  It's also worthy to note that the words and phrases come out in various ~themes~, whether it's ~fruit~ words (banana, apple, oranges, etc.,) or politics (red tape, Watergate, rule by the people, etc.,).  The visuals of the game are a near carbon copy of House of the Dead 2 with a few cosmetic changes: zombies that would usually wield axes, attack with toy mallets, while the heroes of the game have ~typing packs~ strapped on  keyboards with a Dreamcast and battery.  Though the overall look hasn't improved over House of the Dead 2, there's not many games that can compare to the graphic quality of the game.  Though there are some awkward looking animations of CPU human victims, the game still looks very good.  Beyond the excellent gameplay, Typing of the Dead has another thing going for it: extra modes. Beyond the Arcade Mode, there's an Original mode where you can use items you collect with various effects (i.e. healing your character, damages enemies, etc.,).  A mode I spent a great deal of time on was the Drill Mode, featuring a score of mini-games that drill you on different typing skills of precision, speed, and reflex reaction.  What's great about Drill Mode is it shows you your performance, including words per minute as well as displaying your five weakest keys.  A Boss mode that allows you to fight all the bosses in the game, and a Tutorial Mode to show beginners how to type round out the enormous list of bonus features, definitely giving a lot of replay value to this game.  The ultimate decision of whether most consumers will purchase is this game is whether they own the Dreamcast keyboard or not.  For those that own the Dreamcast keyboard, I highly recommend this game especially if you can convince a buddy to bring his DC keyboard along for some two-player action.  Those hesitant to buy a Dreamcast keyboard, especially for a typing game, I can understand why you may pass it up, but I really believe you'll be missing out on one of the coolest Dreamcast games to date.  Excellent challenges, nice visuals, and a surplus of bonus modes are contained within Typing of the Dead but most of all, Smilebit has given Dreamcast maniacs something truly unique in making typing fun. --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Jan 24, 2001"}
