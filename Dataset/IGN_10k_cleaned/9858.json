Just like the Contra series, the Wonder Boy games and several other franchises on the Virtual Console, Rolling Thunder is now rolling out in non-chronological order  this game, Rolling Thunder 2, being, of course, the second in the series. It's the middle installment of a trilogy of arcade run-and-guns from Namco, a series that got its home console start on the NES but then concluded on the Genesis. We can probably expect Rolling Thunder 3 to show up sometime down the road, as it was also released on SEGA's 16-bit platform. But the original was one of the non-Nintendo-approved Tengen releases for the NES, so it's unlikely that it will ever show up in the Wii Shop.   Rolling Thunder 2, then, will have to serve as an introduction to the series for new fans, as it presents the tale of a world gone mad  a terrorist organization called Geldra has destroyed the Earth's orbiting satellites, and the resulting blow to the globe's communication networks has been crippling. It's up to a suspender-clad secret agent named Albatross to infiltrate Geldra's hideouts and take out the terrorist leaders, armed only with his trusty 9mm pistol.   Rolling Thunder 2 might be called a run-and-gun by many, but it's really more of a walk-and-gun. It's a side-scrolling action game with shooting and platforming, sure, but its pace is much more slow and strategic than something like Contra. While controlling agent Albatross, you'll progress through each level at a moderate rate of speed, firing at enemies, ducking their shots, finding cover and leaping between upper and lower planes of play  it's more about finding the right pattern to avoid enemy contact than running through with guns blazing.   Albatross and Leila take a casual trip to Egypt.  Which isn't even an available strategy, really, because your one and only gun is cursed with limited ammo. If you constantly hammer away on the fire button, you'll run out of bullets quickly and be left with a slower, weakened weapon that almost certainly spells certain doom for your hero. You can find spots to reload your weapon and even the occasional temporary upgraded firearm  like a machine gun or laser  but you'll always have to keep an eye on how many shots are left in reserve. It's conservation-minded action gaming.   The need to avoid wasting bullets and the overall slower pace of play could turn some people off from Rolling Thunder 2, and there are a few other elements that might also help deter potential downloaders  stiff control and a fairly severe degree of difficulty.    Albatross isn't all that mobile, as his crouching, walking and jumping all handle pretty rigidly. And there are some questionable non-inclusions in his fighting repertoire, like his inability to fire his weapon while leaping.   Which contributes to his enemies often having the upper hand, positioning themselves in places where they can relentlessly shell you with an endless supply of grenades, but you can't get close enough to place your own counterattacking shot without taking an explosion on the chin. This isn't a one-hit-death game, but you can't take much punishment before going down  and there are several situations, especially in the game's later levels, where you might pull your hair out and turn the power off before succeeding in saving the day.   Rolling Thunder 2 offers a two-player co-op mode, which helps to balance out some of the challenge  Player 2 takes control of Leila, Albatross' partner, who looks like she might control differently, but doesn't. And that's a valid point of appeal for the title, as it's always more fun to run and gun with a friend than by your lonesome.    Or walk and gun. You know what I mean.Rolling Thunder 2 was originally a coin-op cabinet in the arcades, and this edition is the Virtual Console emulation of its SEGA Genesis port. It's a solid conversion, even adding a few new levels beyond what early '90s arcade-goers would have experienced when dropping in their quarters, but it's still a bit too rigid and frustrating to be immediately recommendable for Wii owners to download today. Fans of more strategic shooters should give it a look, but everyone else might want to wait around for Rolling Thunder 3  as it was developed specifically for the Genesis, it could prove to have more lasting value when and if it arrives in the Wii Shop.", "date": "Jan 15, 2008"}
