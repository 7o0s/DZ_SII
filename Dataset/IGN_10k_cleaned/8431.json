Needless to say, the spotlight for this one has come and gone. Is Hands-On Mobile's mobile take on the poorly-reviewed gangster-turned-cop console actioner worth downloading? Or should you flush it like a dimebag when the cops are banging on your door?   Flush.   To be fair, there is some effort put into making True Crime something more than a paint-by-numbers action game. The cop, Marcus, is governed by your own morality. If you make clean busts, such as arresting perps that give up after a few smacks of the baton or returning recovered drugs from a crime, you earn a good cop rating and career points. If you behave more like Vic Mackey from ~The Shield,~ you are labeled as a bad cop. ~ Bad cops don't get much respect at the precinct, but they do get to buy powerful weapons from a shady pawn shop. This is an interesting mechanic in theory, but it's poorly implemented. If you're a good cop, you can buy weapons from your own precinct? Since when did cops have to buy their own gear?   The game attempts to take an open-world approach, basing you at police headquarters, but giving you a map of New York full of cases. You can choose whether or not to head to a random crime in progress where you might find drugs, for example. Taking care of these ~side crimes~ will affect your cop rating, which dictates your choice of weapons.  Having better weapons makes you better suited for the eight story-based missions, which appear as blue dots on the main map.   Working a case is slow-going. Marcus moves like he has cement blocks on his feet, and the perps at crime scenes aren't much faster either. They are terrible shots, too, but this is a blessing because it's a pain to line up your own sights. You do earn stat points which can be applied to your targeting, but working your way through a crowded building full of gun-toting criminals is frustrating and ultimately not fun. You do have an option to strafe, and this helps if your targets are straight ahead of you and remain there, but more often that not, you'll be flanked and you have to line up your shots manually. There is also a stealth button, but the game moves slow enough as it is -- so I found myself just ignoring it after a few missions.   The pacing of the game will wear you down -- it's just too slow. During an early mission, I broke up a bar fight. After wading into the cavernous bar and shooting down the drug-addled brawlers, I had to wander all the way back to the front door. Why can't the mission just end? This is mobile -- we're dealing in stolen moments here. Also frustrating, I entered a random crime mission but realizing I didn't have a gun armed, I backed up toward the entry in hopes of ducking behind a wall for safety. Apparently, I hit the front door ~zone~ and was whisked out of the mission without being asked if I really wanted to leave. And then the case was gone from the main map. Apparently, somewhere between the three seconds it took me to step outside and close the door behind me, the situation was resolved.   The isometric view is just weird in True Crime. As you plod through buildings, pieces of walls vanish and reappear to give you a full view of Marcus at all times. It functions as it's supposed to, but I think a top-down camera or a general re-thinking of the level layouts would have been better.   The game is not attractive. The character sprites are small and feature little detail. The nurse at the precinct (a buxom woman that throws herself at Marcus, of course) is a good example -- she looks like a tiny robot with boobs. The levels lack much detail, too, leaving everything decidedly bland.  True Crime: New York City's turgid pacing keeps it from being an engaging action game. Plodding movement, questionable design choices (buying your weapons from the precinct, really?), and a lackluster visual style make this case of good cop/bad cop easy to call: Bad cop.", "date": "May 3, 2007"}
