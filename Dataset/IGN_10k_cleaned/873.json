Jim was a fountain of creativity, cascading over everything he touched. Jim's gone on that great big Studebaker daytrip in the sky, and the well has dried up in Muppetland. The Muppets are now just puppets, renting their talents out for any two-bit chump to have them dance like trained monkeys.  In comes Take 2, who with their bumbling, cockeyed game plan and flashy dress-up might have played a villain in The Muppet Movie. Here, though, Kermit and the gang sign on the dotted line, and go right ahead in this miserable game. Doc Hopper sneers, as finally he's won, and there is no Rainbow Connection at the end of this Muppet Adventure. Features:  Muppets. Six time zones, four stages each. Wireless, puppeteer-less Muppets. Sparse Muppet voice samples, including Frank Oz as Fozzie. Only for Game Boy Color   So Bunsen Honeydew has been experimenting recently with a time machine, and has invited the Muppets to come see his new invention. Faster than you can say ~Side-scrolling action platformer~, the puppet Muppets are sucked into the machine and whisked away into 24 levels of side-scrolling platform action.  Boys and girls, you know the drill: The control sucks, the graphics are sloppy, the game's music is digi-pop garbage not at all related to the Muppets, the action is tedious, the enemies follow patterns and have no intelligence, and aside from the cut scenes, there's nothing Muppety about this game. Switch Kermit with Pugsley Addams, Wayne or Garth, Chuckie from Rugrats, or Turok, and it's still the same game.  The action in the game consists of either Kermit or Animal (since when is Animal a character that could be controlled?) jumping around and looking for stuff. So it goes with badly-botched license games, the gameplay is wretched. Kermit can throw paper airplanes (because that's what he was always doing on the show, right?), and Animal throws drumsticks. If you've played a lot of these bad licensed games, you've probably guessed that these attacks are nearly ineffectual (it takes five drumsticks to destroy an enemy), and Take 2 has pooped more in the stew by limiting the number of drumsticks and airplanes you can carry. Are you ahead of me yet? Well, then you've probably guessed that the jumping control is bad, and that Kermit and Animal can barely jump over a foe when they're all out of ammo. Oh, and did I mention that characters die from a short fall?  Even the intro sequences, which feature the Muppets doing what Muppets do best (clown around and act goofy) are screwed up. It's cute to see the Muppet characters in the opening scene, but then all our favorite critics, Statler and Waldorf, come on in between rounds. ~Hey, it's the dark ages. How's Kermit supposed to see?~ ~He'll have to use a fiery torch!~ ~Ho Ho Ha Ha Ha!!!~ Wait, that's your punch line? These two obviously need another Geechy Guy Correspondence School Refresher Course.   Hey, a Muppets game? That's great!~Well, it's a good idea!~~It could go OK...~ ~It might be really bad.~~It IS really bad!~ ~It's awful!~~I hate it!~~Boo! Boo!~~Boo! Boo!~", "date": "Apr 18, 2000"}
