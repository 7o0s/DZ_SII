Sorrent recently had the run of the field with top-rated football, racing, and boxing sims, but Tecmo Wireless made serious in-roads with the superlative Tecmo Bowl. Now JAMDAT, current king of bowling, is getting into the game with their new duffer EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 2004.  Features:  Six or more licensed courses Play 9 or 18 holes In-game tutorial Easy save game feature Sample sound effects  JAMDAT was wise to hitch its wagon to the EA Sports' golf king. It immediately lends the series legitimacy, which sports games now need more than ever. But even if JAMDAT's duffer didn't have Tiger's blessing it would still wow as the best wireless golf game available right now, complete with good visuals, great control, and excellent course selection.  Controlling your golfer is incredibly simple and intuitive, but JAMDAT wisely includes a nice in-game tutorial that teaches you the ropes as you play. Play begins with a nice overview of the course, so you can get a solid idea of how to attack the fairway. Then you select your club by pressing up/down on the touchpad. Once you're happy with your selection, an action key (~Select~ on our T720) brings up the swing meter.  The swing meter is a sweeping arc that surrounds your golfer. Press the action key to begin filling the meter. Hit action again when the meter reaches the small green zone -- that's the optimum stroke. Go into the red and you'll blast the ball too far. Once you hit the green section, then meter starts back the other way. Hit action in the next green section to determine the accuracy of your stroke. The further you are outside the green, the greater your hook or slice.  Putting works in a similar fashion. On the green, a red line shows you the path to the hole. Tiny arrows display any grade in the green. You may need to alter the ball's path to compensate for the slope of the green. Press action to start the putt. A flat meter appears on the bottom of the screen. The red flag shows how hard you need to hit the ball to sink it. Hit action to fill the meter, then hit action again when you reach the red flag.  The whole system works very, very well. Also serving the game is the fact that you're playing on real world courses, such as Pebble Beach. And that you see Tiger all the time, in his trademark red and black. There are also neat little touches, such as the game making the phone vibrate when you blow a shot.  Visually, EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 2004 is quite appealing. The courses look vibrant and lush in all their greens, water hazards are appropriately blue, and sand traps are a foreboding beige. The in-game animations when tiger swings look good, too. And despite the screen being crammed with information -- wind, shot count, club selection, and English -- everything is presented clearly so that you're never distracted from the task at hand.  We've certainly heard livelier games on our handsets, but golf never was a bombastic sport to begin with, so we'll let the lack of audio slide. This time, JAMDAT. This time.This Tiger in the woods got mad goods. JAMDAT's crafted an impressive golf game that is a surefire hit -- perfect for amateurs, but complex enough for armchair golfers to enjoy for an hour or two while sitting in an airport or in the back of a deliriously boring meeting. The course selection is great, the visuals are smooth, and the control is excellent. Hopefully this is no fluke and JAMDAT can keep it up for future editions, perhaps a fantasy course sequel with volcanoes and windmills?", "date": "Jan 28, 2004"}
