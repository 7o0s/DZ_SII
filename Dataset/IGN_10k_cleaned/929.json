I mean, whenever I saw an ad for a fancy hotel that promised a world-class dining experience, they always showed a line of employees that included at least 10 cooks.  Apparently someone thought they could co-exist, otherwise people wouldn't be paying for their services, right?  Right?  Well, now that I'm a few years older and a few years wiser, Midway's latest entry into the ~Thunder~ series managed to provide several solid hours of entertainment, but by the same token, demonstrated why the age-old saying makes some sense after all.  Originally displayed at last year's Electronic Entertainment Expo as a yet-unsigned Xleration, Kalisto was hard at work on creating the racer they hoped would give Sega's Rally series all it could handle.  Then along comes Midway with a little idea....  ....and it almost worked without a hitch.  Almost.  Let's start with what I loved.  From square one, no one in their right mind is gonna try to tell you this game ain't pretty.  Humming at near constant 60 FPS, the game does see some slow-down in crowded areas when another care is on-screen, but for the most part it just plain flies.  The sense of speed is spectacular, and the environments are colourful, clean, and wide open.  I'd go so far as to say that this the best looking racer I have ever seen, if not one of the best looking games, period.  Granted, the game kinda cheats with some cheap models and rough geography, but the designer hid it well behind the game's speed and perspective, and for that they deserve props.  Speaking of the lay of the land, here is yet another aspect that Kalisto nailed right on the head.  Not only are the courses extremely beautiful, as I mentioned above, but they are longer than one of my patented pointless introductions.  On some of the outdoor tracks, the laps can extend to upwards of 3 minutes per go-round, and there are so many twists and turns in each one, that you often can't check out every single possible path in a given race.  Think of Sega Rally's feel with Beetle Adventure Racing's killer short-cuts, and you've got this game's basic schpeel.  Some of the tracks are a bit annoying (which I'll touch on in a bit), but others are down-right incredible.  Easily some of the best stuff I have seen in a racer to date.   And the funny thing is, the gameplay is quite tasty as well, for the most part.  The AI is aggressive and very intelligent. The game handles like a demon, with some of the tightest control a DC racer has ever seen.  Not only does 4 Wheel have a solid physics engine that lets you feel your vehicle hug every little nuance of the road, but each car has a distinct, consistent handling style that just feels right.  You will find yourself getting in to each track, figuring out how to take each corner to make sure you come out blazing.  It really is a rush.  And the same could be said of the game's excellent multi-player mode.  A head-to-head dream, the game keeps up its blistering 60 FPS pace with 2 players, and offers a ton of unique mods that you can tool around with.  I must say I was a bit let down that modes this good were wasted on 2-player action, but I guess a 4-player option can always be added next year.  Overall, it is a lot of fun, and still runs brilliantly.  With all these elements in place, you've got to wonder what on earth could keep this from being the must have, super-duper killer app for the Dreamcast.  Well, you remember at the beginning of the review where I was babbling something about cooks and hotels and hookers? Well, OK, there were no hookers, but I sure got your attention, eh?  Anyways.  Back to the point.  My problem with 4 Wheel Thunder is a pretty simple one, and it typically isn't something that bugs me, but for some reason, I just couldn't ignore it.  Somewhere in between the time Kalisto started this project and the final product, the changes they made for Midway killed the soul of this title, and the stench of its death becomes completely unavoidable before all is said and done.  I say this because the game seems to have a distinct internal identity crisis that really hurts my ability to completely enjoy all the good things that are here, simply because the game is just too damn hard.  In case you aren't up on the ~Thunder~ series, it is built on the idea of collecting turbo boosts, laying on the accelerator, and racing like a madman until you pass everyone.  I know this sounds typical, but take that typical idea you have in your head, and multiply it by a good 2.5 billion times, and you have a good idea of how hyped up the ~Thunder~ brand likes it.  When you are going full steam with your turbo on, this game moves really fast.  And normally, this wouldn't be a bad thing, but the way the tracks were designed, there are all sorts of stupid, tiny little things that can bring you to a complete stop.  Sure, these exist in every racing game, but understand that unless you are more than perfect in this game (i.e. no wrecks whatsoever and constant turbo collection/usage), you are totally screwed.  Not just set back.  Not just in need of some seriously precise play if you expect to catch up.  If you stop at all, the race is over.  That's right, kiddies. In addition to being one of the fastest, most beautiful, most exhilarating experiences every to hit a virtual track, 4 Wheel Thunder is also one of the genre's most unforgiving.  At first, the game was hard, but somewhere near the twelfth track, it went from really friggin' hard, to damned-near impossible, and I swear I was painfully close to breaking my monitor.  This is primarily due to two major problems.  One being that the AI is almost too good, and the other being that the tracks were obviously not designed with the game's ~thunderous~ demands in mind.  I can't decide which aspect made this problem more pronounced, but let me explain both, and I'll let you debate it.  The AI, as I said before, is pretty smart, and quite aggressive.  But the thing is, starts you in last place on a rolling start, and for some reason, the bad guys seem more intent on wrecking you then they do winning. They just love to get in front of you and stay in front of you, even if it means locking their bumper into yours and turning with you.  I can understand trying to keep someone from passing me, but not if it means impeding my progress.  I mean, it just seems like these guys are here more to get in my way than they are to win a race, and in my book, that is just some bull$#!%.  And this particular pile just kept smelling worse. Not only do they live to wreck you, but these guys don't use power-ups.  At all.  And you?  You can't win without them. So, this racing crack that you simply must have to move another inch towards victory is totally irrelevant to the rest of the pack.  While you have to position yourself to catch nearly every turbo boost you see, these guys have unnatural speed, and can outpace you in an equivalent car at normal speeds while you are laying in the turbo like its going out of style.  Not only that, but they are smart enough to push you out of the way of said turbos, and even do so in the turn leading up to the boost, which causes you to both miss the blessed turbo and hit a wall. They also just love to slam you in to tiny little roadblocks, at which point two or three other cars will slam into you.  Since they don't need turbos, they fail to care about where they are on the track. And, as I'll comment on in a bit, since they are all on set patterns, they don't give a flying damn about winning, so they just hit you.....so what am I saying, exactly?  I'm saying that, at times, they can cheat you like a bunch of bastards, that's what.  But that's not all. The tracks themselves can also be a pain.  Now, I am not so naive as to believe that Kalisto thought I would never wreck.  The AI likes to squish me too much to even entertain that one.  But by the same token, if they actually intended for me to wreck this much, and still have to deal with the AI cars' enhanced acceleration, then Satan himself must have had a hand in the game engine.  Personally, I'd like to think that the lead programmer was a good man.  He was just lead astray by the deep pockets of Uncle Midway ~Thunder~ initiative.   And so, the game was fundamentally changed with the quickness to meet its May release date, and we got stuck with a game that suffers from some serious identity crisis problems.  As it stands now, the cars almost seem to get kicked around by the bumps on the roads at certain speeds, and you'd be amazed at how constricting the courses can become when you get rammed into a wall by an AI car at full speed.  You just sort of hang vertically up against the edge, and of course, when you come back down, you're facing the other way, only to be hit by three or four cars, which manage to ram you in to a wall.  So you back up..only to get hit by yet another Car, ramming you back into the wall.  Finally when there is no one else behind you, it is safe to try and get back in the race...but the thing is, the first little bump with the wall is enough to keep you from placing, and thanks to the game's oddball championship set-up, you might as well start over.    You see, it isn't a true league.  The way 4 Wheel Thunder's Championship Mode is structured, it accommodates four players.  Obviously yet another remnant of the game's original four-player set-up before it got the ~thunda,~ you're not really competing against an open field where anyone can be a winner. You're competing against four CPU drivers, and for some odd reason, One computer player always had quite a knack for winning (or if you happened to win, placing right behind you), even when there were twelve cars on screen.  Not that I am one to complain, but I'd like to think they game would at least fake being a bit more democratic and let one of the other players win once in a while, but unfortunately, this was not the case.  I have no idea why this aspect was so glossed over, but it still irritates me that when I have to place first out of 12 racers to even make a dent, I am only really competing against three, who seem to finish in the same spots regardless of how hard-fought the battle was for yours truly.  I mean, if the places are so set in stone, why have AI at all?  Why have a championship?  Yes, gang, I am that idealistic.  Call me nuts, but I am a bigger fan of competition if it doesn't sport a big neon sign that screams ~Fix!~.  If you're gonna use blatantly routine AI, it better at least fake dynamic placement in Championship Mode.  Otherwise, you can keep the extra cars.   In case you can't tell, there were times where this game really pissed me off.  But it started out really good.  Challenging, fast, beautiful.  And it will be there for you, as well.  But unless you are the RainMan of racing games, your pot will find yourself frustrated to some degree.  There certainly is a lot to like about 4 Wheel Thunder, but by the same token, it can get tedious at times, and it mostly has to do with the sloppy implementation of the game's new face.  Perhaps if the AI played by the same rules you did.  Perhaps if you were allowed to be a little more human.  Perhaps if they gave you just one more lap to catch up.  Perhaps then it would have been a little less enraging to plod through this soulless racer.  As it stands now, I can honestly say that the pain isn't worth the pleasure in the end.  There is nothing worse than being just behind the next car for an entire 3 minute lap and beating the lap record but failing to pass any of the four cars in front of you.  Funny how he isn't using turbos like you, yet still stays ahead.  Funny how he wrecks repeatedly, and you don't, yet he can keep you at bay by waiting for you and breaking in front of you. Yeah, it's funny like The Dennis Miller Show.  Anyways, enough ranting.  Our initial copy of the game was actually much more difficult than the retail final we ended up reviewing.  Thankfully, it seems the game has been toned down to the point where you can actually place if you know what you are doing, which makes it a bit less painful. If you don't mind a game that is a bit on the unfair side at times and will really challenge both your memory and your reflexes, check it out.  It may not drive you up a wall quite like being literally driven up a wall by a kamikaze AI car drove me up a wall.  But, if you are just looking at this game thinking it is sweet looking and fast, you have been warned.  You may grow weary of the rat race.  -- Brandon Justice, IGNDC", "date": "May 6, 2000"}
