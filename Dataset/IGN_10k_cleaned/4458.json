Released in Japan to mixed reviews as Drag-On Dragoon last September, this somewhat low-key project from former Namco employees has only just begun to light the fires under the bellies of dedicated Squeenix fans; and though it was originally presented as an action/RPG when first announced shortly after the Square Enix merger proclamation of 2002, its role-playing elements and heritage are actually rather slim.Instead, Drakengard is best described as an incredibly faithful combination of KOEI's highly popular Dynasty Warriors franchise and the often overlooked Panzer Dragoon series. Truthfully that initial description should already set off the warning buzzer for players not interested in the aforementioned titles or genres; as the problems, idiosyncrasies, and tribulations associated with games such as those are just as present here as they were in its predecessors. But for those of us who enjoy our action a little mindless and our environments a little fantastical, then Drakengard doesn't turn out half bad at all; even if it is a bit on the repetitious side.StoryOne of Drakengard's biggest strengths is its richness of storyline. Set in a world where humans and animals can form life pacts to join their souls together as one, the game presents players with a heavy dose of fantasy right from the outset. Despite its world of goblins, fairies, and other such creatures, however, Drakengard also manages to maintain a realistic medieval feel with dark characters and gritty undertones. As the plot moves forward, the world and its inhabitants become more and more bizarre with a definite similarity to the equally gloomy series Neon Genesis Evangelion. In fact, Drakengard producer Takamasa Shiba has gone on record by stating that he was heavily influenced by Shinji and company when he first began work on the game a few years ago -- a fact that becomes more and more obvious as you progress.  When Drakengard first begins the narrative is quite a bit different. Set in the middle of a great conflict between two factions known as the Empire and the Union, the game opens with the seriously angry ex-prince antagonist named Caim. Brother to the goddess princess Furiae, Caim's initial mission is to rescue his sibling from the clutches of the Imperial Guard who has locked her deep within the confines of her own castle. To his credit, Caim does manage to fight his way through the horde of Imperial soldiers to reach the castle gates, but at a serious price -- he's on the brink of death. As he stumbles to the castle courtyard he barely alive, he discovers the carcass of a captured dragon and after trading species-hating barbs at one another decides to form a beast-pact to save each other's lives. The bargain works and both of their lives are spared but Caim bears the seal of their agreement on the tip of his tongue; costing him his voice in the process.From here things become even more interesting as we're introduced to Furiae's  fianc Inuart and the high priest assigned to protect the goddess, Verdelet. Initially on the same quest as Caim, the pair are immediately captured themselves and sent to various prisons around the country -- complicating things even further for a hero who has few friends and acquaintances left to save. Surprisingly it's Caim's disturbing hatred of the empire and not his need to do the right thing that powers the story along. So rather than feeling a need to race off and save his friends, Caim is much more concerned with toppling the empire. It's actually pretty refreshing to see that Cavia opted to avoid the typical ~misunderstood hero~ route that so many other plot-based videogames have taken, and move instead towards an appropriately edgy thematic the whole way through. Each of the game's 13 chapters seem to get more and more disturbing than the last one and despite the fact that Caim does have a few moments of clarity, his character's focus never truly changes -- as he's overwhelmed by anger, hate, and a fierce dedication for a sister with little else.    To keep players interested in the progression of the story, the more dynamic emotions are told through the personalities of the supporting characters. Whether its Furiae's deep sense of duty or Inuart's passionate inner conflict, the constant twists and turns that each of these people make are what really makes the game worth playing for users who have already slashed their way through Dynasty Warriors hundreds of times. These protagonists are interesting and realistic, and much like Arc the Lad: Twilight of the Spirits offers a storyline that doesn't compromise its direction with typical feel-good fluff. And we admire Drakengard deeply for this.GameplayWe've said it a million times but there's just no other way to put it: Drakengard's mechanics are essentially a combination of Dynasty Warriors and Panzer Dragoon. Broken up into three different types of gameplay, (Dogfight Mode, Melee Mode, and Strafe Mode) Drag-On Dragoon is generally all about one thing and one thing only: killing stuff. Primarily done in melee mode (approximately 75% of the time we'd wager), this ~annihilate everything~ ideal requires players to step onto the battlefield and slice through anything that gets in their way. The only button you'll ever need to do this with is X, and rapidly tapping it in various patterns determines how many attacks you can pull off in succession before starting over again. Simple as this may sound, it's made much more complicated by the weapon you select in the process; as the various kinds that you can choose from each have different properties and uses. Swords, staves, axes, hammers, lancets, spears, and other such instruments of destruction all have various advantages and disadvantages and are sure to cater to different styles and tastes. Being able to select them on the fly without having to go to a separate menu is a nice touch too.  But Caim has other abilities to help him out as well. Not only can he block and evade incoming enemy attacks to save his precious health bar, he can also utilize magic spells unique to whichever weapon he is currently using. Swirling balls of fire, shards of enemy-seeking ice and powerful earthquakes are just a few of the several mystical assaults at your disposal. Additionally, there's a limited experience system that's been incorporated into the mix so that the attributes and appearance of each weapon continues to grow the more that you use it (Caim has experience-based upgrade element to himself as well, but it's resigned to only for gaining hit points). If they're really in trouble, players can even call upon helper buddies for additional assistance as special limited time power-ups. It's the inclusion of all these different elements that helps separate Drakengard from becoming just another clone.Of course, Caim's most unique talent is his ability to call on the services of his faithful red dragon. Upgradeable in both attack power and appearance just like a weapon, the dragon can prove pretty invaluable during the ground missions. Called ~Strafe Mode~, this technique allows players to switch from sword to lizard in a matter of seconds and is a sure-fire way to clear the battlefield of additional bad guys if you're in trouble. The catch is that Caim and his weapons don't gain any experience points in this mode, as the upgrades go only to the dragon. It's a key balancer to making it important for players to switch between melees and strafe modes; because if a user is resigned to only playing one kind of way, they'll feel the consequences later on when they're forced to play in a mode-specific level. It works very well.The last gameplay feature, known as Dogfight Mode, is an extension of the strafe element only with a lot more freedom. Giving the dragon full three-dimensional range of motion, the Dogfight Mode is entirely reminiscent of the aforementioned Panzer Dragoon series with straightforward shooting objectives and plenty of enemies to vanquish. It's this aspect of the game that stood out the most for us in terms of pure entertainment value and should prove to be quite popular for casual exhibition players.    But as mindlessly entertaining as Drakengard turns out to be, it still runs into the same problems that similar titles in this category always do -- that is, it has an abundance of repetition. And while we were definitely more forgiving of Dynasty Warriors 4 when we reviewed it in 2003, it at least managed to offer a multitude of key features that pushed the genre in a forward direction. Randomized stages, reactionary A.I., more interactive environments, and character creation were just a few them; though Drakengard offers none of that.In fact, Drakengard appears to have taken a few steps backward in several respects. Especially in terms of enemy aggression and tactics; as 90% of your adversaries just stand there clumped together in groups waiting for you to come at them with the same scripted patterns again and again. Luckily the more powerful enemies and boss creatures mix up their attacks when compared to the weaker foes, but for those of us who have slaved through Crimson Sea, Mystic Heroes, and Dynasty Warriors, Drakengard feels overly dated. By chapter three, players should realize that they're finding themselves fighting what's essentially the same stupid foot soldier in different clothing -- and less dedicated fans will likely hang it up from there.There other less glaring flaws too, like the stubborn ~snapback~ camera and a lack of environmental diversity, but the real snag here is the repetitive A.I. listed above. Strangely, Drakengard is still highly addictive and offers up several moments of true mindless fun. And you have to give the developers brownie points for including the option to replay any level you've beaten again to find what you missed the first time. Being able to carry over your findings to story mode as result was much appreciated as well.  GraphicsStylistically, Drakengard offers a much different look than your typical Square Enix offering. Spiky hair, bizarre tube tops, and elongated monkey tails aren't the type of examples that you're going to find over the course of your adventure. Instead, the game offers an unusual blend of Central European inspiration and Sadamoto Yoshiyuki-like creature designs. Some of Drakengard's beasts are pretty out there too -- like the half-headed techno-golem and lumbering orange axe-blob as just a few examples. This mix of fantasy and revisionist history works extremely well and looks absolutely fantastic in the game's high-quality CGI cut scenes.Once you turn your attention to the in-game graphics engine, however, things aren't quite as impressive. For starters, there isn't any widescreen or HDTV support, and though the characters and enemies themselves offer up a nice amount of detail on an individual level, the group animations are almost identical. It's actually rather disappointing when you see a crowd of eight or nine armored minions moving towards you only to mimick each others movements in perfect unison. It's a practice that even Dynasty Warriors 2 avoided when it was first released as a PlayStation 2 launch title in 2000, and one that the Drakengard team should have been mindful of in the last four years of the game's development. But at least the environments are sizeable with tons of enemies populating them simultaneously.Another obvious visual problem is the game's limited draw distance. In fact, the fog of war covers each stage so much that it almost convinced us that Drakengard takes place in the murkiest areas of Loch Ness. Occasional clipping problems with trees, rocks, and other obstacles show up too, and infrequent framerate issues pop up whenever too many units are on screen at the same time. To its credit, the game does look brilliant when played in the aerial-based dragon mode with plenty of pyrotechnics, objects, and particles flying about like there's no tomorrow. And though fog and draw-distance are issues in this department too, it's nowhere near as prominent when compared to that of the melee mode. Luckily, we do get an interesting variety of enemies in the later stages and the colorful magic spells spice up the action.   SoundUnlike Square Enix's last couple of releases (like Final Fantasy X-2 and UNLIMITED: SaGa), Drakengard doesn't support any of the high-end Dolby surround sound conventions. Receiver owners will be happy to note that the game does at least support traditional surround sound in the most basic of ways, but the vocals sound a little drowned out and distant when played through a typical system rather than a two-speaker television set. That small technical hitch is a shame too, as the voice acting in Drakengard is rather solid with plenty of British accents to go around (though we did have an issues with the ~mystery voice~ that speaks to Inuart for most of the adventure -- not good).Musically there's no other way to describe Drakengard apart from ~disappointing.~ The bizarre aspect of that statement is that the melodies themselves are actually quite strong with a nice mix of tranquility, anger, and terror that, if extended, would easily shoot the game to the top of our most wanted soundtracks list. The problem is that the disc repeats the same few bars over and over again over the course of the battle with no context-sensitive changes whatsoever and no variety in tracks from stage to stage. So while the score sounds great on an individual basis, hearing the same repetitive tune for almost an hour in each level wears on your nerves very quickly. The audio effects, at least, do their job well and combine all the necessary elements of a quality slasher game: screaming, yelling, and the clangs of metal.In the same prestigious company as titles like kill.switch and Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance, Drakengard makes one hell of a weekend rental. It's easy to pick up, easy to get into, and incredibly satisfying for gamers looking to slaughter thousands of armored bad guys. What it isn't, though, is the second coming of the Dynasty Warriors series, nor is it the RPG that all the advertisements make it out to be. It's an action game pure and simple, and one that succeeds and fails on multiple levels Even if it does have an eerily dark story, creepy main characters, and a distinctive antagonist.Still, we'd love to see a future sequel to Drakengard that could maximize the franchise's real potential. With a more progressive approach to the stage design and enemy A.I., it could prove to be quite a formidable rival for the Dynasty Warriors series. But with the four-year development time it took to make the first one and the Project Dragon Sphere team already working on an entirely new project, the possibility of such a follow-up is highly unlikely -- or at least, it is for the moment it is.Fun but not perfect, Drakengard is definitely not for everyone.", "date": "Feb 13, 2004"}
