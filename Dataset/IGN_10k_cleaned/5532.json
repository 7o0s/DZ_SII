The first-person shooter market is overloaded with clones and rip-offs.  You can't walk through a software store these days without seeing 20 boxes that compare themselves to Quake.  As we all know, imitation often means mediocrity as developers churn out games that are unoriginal and rehashes of last year's big FPS.  Fortunately, developers like Monolith come along and blow the hell out of the competition.  With Shogo Monolith proves that, with a good idea and excellent implementation, FPS titles can still offer something unique and genuinely fun.   Shogo casts you in the role of Sanjuro Makabe, a Mobile Combat Armor (MCA) pilot and a Commander in the United Corporate Authority Security Force.  Set against a Japanese anime backdrop, this is the game BattleTech fans have been waiting for.  There's blood and gore but, like most Japanese animated films, the storyline in Shogo is rich and multi-branched, involving love, long lost friends, and moral decisions.  Shogo sports four different MCAs that you can choose from for each mission.  There's the fast but light Shogo Akuma-12, the behemoth Andra-25, and the well-balanced Ordog-7 and Enforcer Mark VII.  Each MCA supports an impressive and unique weapons complement, including several energy weapons and heavy artillery launchers.  My favorites are the 'Bullgut' multiple rocket launcher and the high-powered 'Juggernaut' which fires 105mm shells and can take out other Mechs with one well-placed shot.  The gun animations and weapon special effects are extremely impressive making laying down a little fire fun even if there aren't any bad guys on the screen.  For added versatility, your MCAs can change into vehicles which gives you increased speed, but renders your weapon systems inoperative.   Shogo not only lets you command huge Mechs, but also includes on-foot missions where you control Sanjuro against other humans.  The transition between the MCA and Sanjuro missions really gives Shogo unique playability options and add to the overall depth of this title.  The weapons in the on-foot mode are more of your standard fare found in most FPSers: pistols, shotguns, machine guns and the like.  There is a mondo-boss sniper rifle with a grenade launcher attachment though and, if you happen to run out of ammo, Sanjuro draws his deadly Katana and prepares for a little mano-a-mano combat.  Level design in Shogo is intuitive and straight forward and you'll rarely be at a loss as to what you should do next.  But just because you know where to go doesn't mean the tasks are easy.  Let me tell you, jumping through fan blades in the airshaft level is a real pain in the ass.  You'll definitely be re-loading your game often, but you won't care 'cause playing this game is such a delight.  The action is super-fast and the sense of scale Shogo gives you is really unique to any FPS.  Running through city streets taking on other 100' tall MCAs while towering over tiny cars is a very satisfying experience.  And when you step on pedestrians, little globules of blood squirt everywhere and cover surrounding surfaces.  Too cool!!!  There's even an option that allows you to turn off the gore if you're worried about the little ones.  Shogo is one of the first FPSers to utilize in-game cutscenes and the designers incorporated this feature quite wonderfully, presenting the player with a solid story without cutting from the action and visual consistency of the game.  The writing and voice acting is actually pretty good in Shogo and Sanjuro has quite a sense of humor.  I found myself cracking up during many of the cutscenes, like when he coddles Admiral Akkaraju's ego by telling him that he's his idol after showing up late to a mission briefing.  Overall, Shogo is a great game, but it's not perfect.  There's nothing major here that I have to complain about, but the frequent CD-ROM and hard drive accesses do halt the action briefly at some points.  However, after the data is loaded into memory, the action is fast-paced and non-stop.  The Mechs move with speed, style, and grace and the payback after waiting for a few seconds is extremely satisfying.  I can truthfully say that Shogo is one of the best moving and most playable FPS I've played in a long time and the level of detail is amazing.  All in all, Shogo is one of the best games I've played this year.  Its compelling story, in-game cinematics, nearly continuous action, and unique armaments add new life to the FPS genre.  I thought I was sick and tired of shooters, but Shogo proved me wrong. Shogo is the first game to utilize Monolith's in-house LithTech engine and I'm looking forward to seeing more games that use this new beauty.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Nov 7, 1998"}
