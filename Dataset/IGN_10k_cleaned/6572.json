We are seeing more beat-em-up games trickling in than ever before, as developers, licensed and unlicensed, are trying their hands at the ambitious development that comes with a newly raised quality bar.  THQ's Danny Phantom won't ever achieve legendary status, though it is obvious the team is putting their best foot forward in this inspired and entertaining tribute to Astro Boy.     Danny Phantom offers a strong design that feels entirely within the franchise.  The game follows Danny as he attempts to restore order to the world by battling enemy ghosts.  Basically, this is just a good excuse to kick the crap out of anything that moves, and it works just fine.  The game retains the look and feel of the television show by means of an intro story, cut scenes, and environment design that look as though it was ripped directly from the show.  Danny Phantom offers three save slots, a feature that almost induced a heart attack for yours truly.  Quality was obviously a necessity, as this game has better production value than most licensed games on the market.  What could be better?  How about entertaining gameplay?   Amazingly enough, Phantom offers gameplay that is a bit basic, but solid nonetheless.  The design is obviously Treasure inspired, offering level after level of constant fighting teamed with over the top special moves.  Thankfully, the red flag was never thrown during development, and the result is a very entertaining children's title which includes tons of action.  While the gameplay is very simplistic, offering one-button combos and huge characters, it keeps entertaining from beginning to end.  Flying stages are included as well, giving the game even more of a throwback feel to Treasure's design, as Danny zaps incoming enemies with green energy bolts.  Level ups are handled automatically, giving the player a new attack every couple of levels.  This keeps the game simple, though it does sacrifice some needed depth for that simplicity.  The game moves fast, and the action is relatively solid.  There are a few strange moments, such as when Danny gets hit, and the frozen state seems to last a bit longer than the animation.  Combo timing may not be perfect, though that is simply the difference between Danny and Astro Boy.  The game may not have the polish of a triple A title, but it certainly offers more entertainment than most of the Nick Games lineup.     While Danny Phantom captures the heart of the show by offering inspired environments and solid presentation, the overall production is just a bit too simple.  The gameplay was surprisingly strong for a licensed product, though the sound and graphical departments do the trick without going above and beyond.  The soundtrack is solid, offering strong tunes mixed with sound effects worthy of any beat-em-up.  Graphical presentation, however, is a bit too simple to impress.  The levels are designed well and animations are acceptable, there is just nothing that goes above and beyond to add extra value to the package.  In-game effects are used to add a visual edge to power-ups and special attacks, though the bulk of the game is far more simplistic.  By no means is Danny Phantom below par, though the leap in gameplay is much larger than the jump made in production value.    Though inspired, Danny Phantom doesnt quite sit among the greats of GBA brawlers.  The design is solid, obviously taken from Treasures Astro Boy, and as a simple action game it holds its own.  Presentation does the license justice, offering the visual atmosphere of the show without dragging out the front end of the game.  Action is fast and mindless, and though it is the appeal of the package, it is also the downfall.  Danny Phantom is simple, shallow, though entertaining.  It may not be a contender when up against some of the heavier hitters on the system, but it still manages to be entertaining while it lasts.  Most of all, the game is a success because it is fun.  This is a classic case of an inspired design, teamed with strong execution, offering one concise gameplay mechanic rather than pursuing multiple genres within one package.  For that reason, Danny Phantom is a success, raising the licensed bar much like its design inspiration did for the genre itself.", "date": "Jan 24, 2006"}
