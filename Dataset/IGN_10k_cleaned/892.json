{"name": "The Crystal Key", "name_review": "Crystal Key", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/04/26/crystal-key", "text": "Let's face it - it takes some serious brass to release an adventure game like The Crystal Key with all the Myst-bashing going on these days. Some gaming industry journalists are even ready to sign the death certificate of the entire adventure genre. But, Dreamcatcher Games has been working on The Crystal Key for 5 years now, and they've managed to release a game with grand visuals and solid style. It may not breathe all the life back into a dying genre, but it's still a surprisingly fun game that shouldn't be overlooked by graphical adventure game fans.   Days after Earth intercepts a cryptic message from space warning of an evil ~Ozgar,~ a huge menacing spaceship appears over us. Able to send only one person in a specially designed spacecraft to find help with the fight against Ozgar, they send you (big surprise), in hope of saving humanity. To be honest, it comes off as cheesy, but it doesn't detract from the game. You come to expect a bit of cheesiness in an adventure title, and it can often make it that much more fun.  Because you have an archenemy, Ozgar, it adds a slightly different angle to the formula by providing someone for you to hate in addition to something to save. Ozgar is a freaky-looking, robe-wearing alien that gives you the same kind of chills that Emperor Palpatine does in Return of the Jedi. Using star portals to travel between luscious worlds (the portals look suspiciously like those used in the movie, Stargate), you find clues to the existence of a race of people who fight an ongoing battle against Ozgar by attempting to keep the portal technology out of his hands.   The graphics of The Crystal Key are excellent, and the Quicktime VR technology adds a great deal of immersion, giving its environment a much better feel than the standard slide show style play of other Myst clones. Everything is seen from a first-person perspective, and the Quicktime VR allows 360 degree panning of a scene, which often captures the essence and feel of a world. The worlds in The Crystal Key are all beautiful and detailed, and include scenery of desert, jungle, and water. The graphics really seems to be where the design team focused most of their time and resources, and it shows -- the 3D modeling and art is top-notch. When you transition between spots, the video animation gets a little blurry and pixely, but for the most part runs smoothly and looks fabulous. If you get sick of the scene transition movies, its always possible to skip them, which is a crucial feature after you've traveled through an area more than a few times.   One of the main factors that made Myst such a success was its outstanding soundtrack and sound effects, yet this is one area where The Crystal Key doesn't follow suit. The sound work is passable, offering little in the way of music other than occasional mood-setting ambient tunes. The sound effects could have been a lot better as well -- they came off sounding exceptionally average. Sound is an area that could have worked towards making The Crystal Key an outstanding adventure game rather than simply a good one, and it's unfortunate that they didn't decide to spend more time on this aspect of the game.   The gameplay in The Crystal Key boils down to select Quicktime VR interest points which you can jump between using nicely rendered movies. Interfacing with the game requires just a single click of the mouse, which is a feature that makes this game particularly accessible to more casual or less technologically experienced gamers. By sweeping the mouse across the screen you can find areas you can investigate more closely or items that you can pick up. The inventory, which is displayed at the bottom of the screen, holds a number of objects that you can use to interact with the world and solve puzzles. You can't examine the items when they are in the inventory, which is a bit of a letdown. It's a classic example of a sci-fi/fantasy adventure game, and some of the puzzles were quite challenging and usually involved the use of inventory items on the environment. There were areas in the game that are impassible if you don't find a particular item before you moved on to the next area, which is frustrating if you don't save often enough.   Unfortunately, The Crystal Key didn't escape production without a few bugs. I experienced one particularly nasty plot-stopping bug that prevented me from moving past the jungle world and completing the game. I do feel that this was primarily isolated to my particular PC hardware/software specs, as I didn't experience the bug on another test machine. I also got an annoying error message when attempting to load a saved game, but this didn't effect the game in any other way, and is fixed in a subsequent patch. Although it doesn't detract too much from the game, the manual is a joke. All of the pages in my copy were cut way off-center, so that the end of each page was cut off. The manual, even if it were cut properly, wouldn't be of much use because of its sparse information and because it's a game that's fairly easy to dive in and play without a lot of extra reading.  I think it's important to note that this game isn't intended for Quake-heads and adrenaline fiends. It's a game that's marketed towards the same people who bought Myst and Riven (which, like it or not, is a very large market). Quite simply, if you hated Myst you're not likely to find any enjoyment in The Crystal Key. But, if you liked Myst and other graphical adventure games like it, or even if you're neutral about them, I think you'll appreciate the gorgeous visuals and the cool puzzles. It may have a cheesy story and average sound, but there's an addictive quality about it that's difficult to describe, and you'll find yourself playing it much later into the night than you intended. This, combined with the low system requirements, makes The Crystal Key a title all adventure game fans should seriously consider. With graphics on the upcoming next-generation systems and consoles able to render comparable images to The Crystal Key's pre-rendered shots in real-time, this may be one of the last true adventure games.  -- Erik Peterson", "date": "Apr 26, 2000"}
