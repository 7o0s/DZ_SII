{"name": "Lord of the Rings [GBA]: Return of the King", "name_review": "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/10/lord-of-the-rings-return-of-the-king", "text": "It's been almost exactly a year since Electronic Arts unleashed its first videogame take on the extremely massive Lord of the Rings theatrical release on the console and the Game Boy Advance. It was interesting to see The Two Towers, a five hundred page novel and three hour film boil down to a Gauntlet-slash-Diablo game design. But it actually worked, bringing a nice representation of the film's action and plotline in several levels of action for the game's playable characters. The game design returns in the Game Boy Advance version of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, just in time for the theatrical release of the third movie. The GBA sequel doesn't add much beyond the new storyline, additional playable characters, and minor gameplay and graphic tweaks, but it's still a great and recommended design on the Game Boy Advance, especially for those who really dig the Tolkien series and Peter Jackson films. Features Six playable characters (two additional are hidden) Different story and level paths for different characters Bonus, unlockable maps Link cable support for two player co-op (multiple cartridge) Cartridge save (four slots)  Connectivity with the GameCube version  Like in The Two Towers before it, the storyline in Lord of the Rings: Return of the King actually begins in the previous movie for the first few level challenges before branching out into the action and situations of the movie that it's based upon. Return of the King features more unique level challenges than the previous game; the levels that Frodo or Eowyn run through are distinctly different from the challenges that are thrown at Aragon, Legolas and Gandalf, since their situations take different routes in the movie. This, along with the varying differences in combat and skills of the different characters, really adds to the variety and replayability of the game; even if you've finished the adventure with one character, there's plenty to uncover and unlock by selecting a new member of the Fellowship to play.  Since the game doesn't stray much from what the Game Boy Advance team created for The Two Towers, The Return of the King isn't much more than an elaborate game of Gauntlet or Diablo. It's not as elaborately designed as the console game with its 3D engine, context-sensitive interaction, and film-footage incorporation. But even though it doesn't feel as ~big budget~ as its Xbox, GameCube, and PS2 counterpart, the GBA version's a well-designed hack-and-slash because it's not quite as mindless; players will need to attack situations carefully or they're end up repeating the level. Legolas, for example, is skilled with the arrows, so it's best that he backs away from any up-close action since his hand weapon skills and techniques aren't very useful.  Players will also need to pick up and equip items as they fight, and since there are many variations of armor, weapons, and clothing, players will have to constantly manage their character's equipment, buying and selling new ones so their combat skills are at their peak. There are also many more character skills to earn in The Return of the King in comparison to The Two Towers, and the game features a great sense of customization since players will have to choose which of their skills they want to assign their earned points after gaining a level.  The game engine of The Two Towers definitely received a shot in the arm for the sequel. Though certain elements like character animations and background tiles look recycled from last year, the developers have managed to get a few more character sprites on-screen to make the action a little more intense. There are also better graphical effects going on, including a sprite reflection on any water surface...a definitely nice and welcome touch. And because of the game's multiplayer focus, some of the single player missions this year actually feature cooperative play with another member of the Fellowship party. though someone made a bit of a design goof: your computer controlled partner's kills actually give you experience points.  And speaking of multiplayer, The Return of the King again features an absolutely fantastic mode where you and a buddy can romp through many of the game's levels with your own character; the attribute points from the save carry over into the game's cooperative modes. Another link mode, the connection between it and the GameCube game encourages players to romp through both versions in order to acquire and unlock secret stuff. And since the console version is actually very cool as well, there's no reason to not take advantage of this if you play on both the Game Boy Advance or GameCube...or have a friend with the other version. Just like the previous game, The Return of the King does tend to get repetitive since it's the same action over and over, just with a different pattern of different enemies. But like last year's design, it's a save anywhere type of game, which makes it a portable-friendly title. The enhancements to the gameplay definitely enhance an already solid action game, and it's also a very recommended two player experience as well. The Return of the King is a nice compliment to a great film, and a decent follow-up to an already enjoyable action title on the handheld.", "date": "Nov 10, 2003"}
