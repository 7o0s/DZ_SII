Not, John Wayne, silly boy. The Duke of Nukem. The rough-riding action hero that has chewed his way through a series of hard-hitting action games on just about every platform you can imagine, save for this current console generation -- and cellphones. Well, now the GameCube and Xbox must play catch up, because thanks to Machineworks and SK Media, the Duke is alive and well in your pocket.  Features:  Multiple weapons Voice quips from the Duke himself Several levels of action  The Duke debut on your handset is an impressive one. Playing more like his old-school 2-D adventures than the recent round of 3-D FPS games, Duke Nukem Mobile is a fast, somewhat furious shooter that should easily entertain anybody.  Starting things off on the right foot are the patented Nukem quips at the start of each level. ~This is really pissing me off.~ ~Come get some.~ All delivered in the trademark gravel-tongued growl. (That same one that irritated Bruce Campbell to no end when he rightfully felt the Duke was stealing his schitck.) And as soon as the Duke finishes his sentence, the pig troopers storm toward him, fodder for his shotgun.  Duke has several weapons at his disposal -- most sound the same. In a console game, that would disappoint, but with the amount of sound already in Duke Nukem Mobile, there is plenty forgiveness. Especially when you hear the piggy squeal as a swine trooper eats pavement. And explodes in a cloud of puke-green goo. Very satisfying.  The levels are very straight-forward. Duke runs from left to right (and sometimes back again), clearing out aliens that have descended to earth with one mission: destroy humanity. The Duke isn't about to tolerate this, so with gun in hand, you must clear out each level. There is usually a locked door at the end of each street or alley, so keep blasting until the keycard appears in the entrails of a fallen foe. Some enemies drop armor and health, but always be on the lookout for abandoned ammo. There's no shortage of alien pigs in Duke Nukem Mobile.  Control is simple. Use the touch pad to move Duke in al four directions. Fire with a designated key (on the T720 we tested the game on, it was the ~select~ key) and switch weapons with another. The only drawback is that running left and right is quick and smooth. Moving up and down is not. Dodging enemy shots is sometimes difficult in the cramped quarters of a handset screen.  Duke Nukem Mobile does provide a little help though, considering that handset control are never perfect. The aiming is somewhat fudged. You will land a shot on an alien, even if the Duke's shotgun is aimed at the pig goon's foot. This keeps things moving along nicely. Without it, we would have been tempted to fold the phone back up after the third level.  At least, we thought it was the third level. See, most levels look extremely similar. Same street, same brick, same panels, same roboguns, same pigs. Naturally, to keep the game's memory footprint at a minimum some variety had to be sacrificed, but Gameloft manages to squeeze different environments out of it's games. And since everything else in Duke Nukem Mobile is handled so well, we were hoping this would be, too. The Duke has been around for a long time, and some of his games have been downright horrible. Even the Duke woulda been ashamed to star in them. (Ugh, remember his N64 adventure?) But Duke Nukem Mobile is an excellent start for the cigar-chomping bad boy. The voice samples and alien screams are fantastic mood-setters. Hopefully, in his next outing, he'll have more varied, interactive worlds to explore and subsequently blow up. Machineworks and SK media have done a slick job, and I'm very curious to see what's next from each of them.", "date": "Jan 20, 2004"}
