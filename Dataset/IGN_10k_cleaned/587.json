After                all, how could one of the best 2D fighting series possibly make                the leap into 3D without losing its charm?             Capcom was confident, however, and handed the project off to Takara,                who presented the world with the EX series. It wasn't better, it                may not have been as good, but it was different. And it worked.                SNK's fighters have always been amazing. Fatal Fury and Samurai                Showdown have been staples of arcade gaming since the fighter genre                began. Seeing the success that Capcom had with its baby, SNK decided                that giving the Fatal Fury series that 3D facelift might work just                as well. Maybe they should have thought a little harder. Gameplay             In a fighter, control means everything. Not just button mashing,                but response to the directional controls, and recognition of combos.                Street Fighter EX had an amazingly complex combo system that allowed                many multi-hit combos to be linked together, but FF: WA's combos                are just amazingly complex. The ~Super Special~ moves                are insanely difficult to pull off (in classic FF style), and the                overall effect is rarely worth the effort.              Control is annoying, because everything seems to happen just slighty                after you execute it - not so fast that it's right on, but not slow                enough to be a predictable lag. The overall presentation feels rushed                and weak. This is not a step forward for the series, it's a leap                backwords into the days of the 16-bit system ports.             Graphics             Ahhhh something that I can comment at least semi-nicely on. The in-game                graphics in FF: WA are not great. They're just like most of the                game - average. However, the game's animations are top-notch. Fluid and varied,                the animations actually make the end result of pulling some of the                tougher moves a little more worthwile -- but only a little. The opening                FMV, however, is absolutely stunning, boasting near-Namco or Square                quality.              SNK's earlier                promise of a solid 60 fps doesn't hold up. There are moments                when the frame rate jumps up to around that number, but there are                just as many when it reaches 15. In fact, the knockout hit rewards                the player with a ~slow-mo~ sequence whereby the opponent                falls to the ground at a mind-blowing 10 fps. The backgrounds are                the Tekken-style 360-degree image wrapped around a 2D plane that                serves as a floor. While Tekken and SF EX had at least interesting                textures to match the background, Wild Ambition's floor is a drab,                lifeless texture, and somehow manages to stand out from the background                even more than if it were just shaded.             Sound               Sweet, merciful crap, it's quite possible that the sound is the                worst part of Wild Ambition. Every sound -- the effects, music,                and voices sound like they were recorded underwater. Horribly washed                out and sampled at what sounds like 11KHz, there is no point in                even hearing the effects, much less enjoying them. The music is                rarely engaging and often sub-standard, and the effects are your                standard grunts and ~hee-yahs.~ In fact, the only quality                sound comes from the CG movies, which feature crisp, clear effects,                and great ambient noise.It's just disappointing               to see a 2D-to-3D conversion turn out to be so horrible, especially               when it comes from such an awesome lineage. While the game does               boast a few extras, they're not nearly enough to warrant a purchase.", "date": "Jan 4, 2000"}
