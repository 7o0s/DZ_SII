The first game based on the Joe Rogan-hosted high-flying ickfest is Fear Factor H2O Challenge, which may surprise some fans of the show, depending on their expectations of a game bearing the ~Fear Factor~ name.   Features:   Swimming action  Collect starfish  Popular NBC reality show license   The game stars a little diver that must pass a series of underwater swim challenges, racing against the clock to collect starfish while avoiding meaner-than-mean piranha, gnashing clamshells, sea stalagmites, and rotating rock arms. Along the way, divers must search out keys to open underwater doors and pass through air bubble generators to gulp down the ~O~ part of H2O.   Perhaps the most quizzical thing about Overloaded's game is that the ~Fear Factor~ license factors into the game so little. There is no Joe Rogan, no squeamish challenges, no over-the-top cliffhanger moments before commercial break. And although we've seen the show only a few times, nobody here recalls a challenge where a contestant had to swim around piranha and spikes to pick up flashing starfish.   This is not to say that Fear Factor H2O Challenge is a horrible game. Really, it's not. It just doesn't make sense in the context of its license. The game plays more like the swimming levels from Alex Kidd in Miracle World and Super Mario World. And those were great game play sequences, so as something to aim for, Overloaded picked good targets.   The swimming is controlled simply. Instead of jamming on a button to stay afloat, you just use the touchpad to swim in whatever direction necessary. Unfortunately, the controls are a little less responsive than needed. Sure, nobody expects you to move like the Flash while dunked, but it's hard to flee from toothy fish when one springs out from behind starfish.   Fear Factor H2O Challenge is a reasonably attractive game. The visuals are crisp and the use of color is fine. It's just that the game, since it is endowed with the ~Fear factor~ moniker, could have used a little more of the show's gross-out razzle-dazzle. As it stands, what we have is an average little swimming jam with decent visuals and okay audio.Because it's hard to get noticed in the crowded decks, I totally understand why Overloaded sought out the ~Fear factor~ license. It's a known quantity -- a show watched by many fans on NBC. It's just too bad the license applies so little to the game itself. Maybe Overloaded can craft a cow brains eating contest next where Joe Rogan eggs you on. Fear Factor H2O Challenge is just a so-so game, and with so many great games available on handsets right now, it's just impossible to recommend something so-so.", "date": "Jul 14, 2004"}
