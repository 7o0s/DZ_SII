{"name": "Jack the Ripper [2004]", "name_review": "Jack the Ripper", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/02/12/jack-the-ripper", "text": "Few unsolved crimes have captured the imagination of writers as the series of murdered and mutilated prostitutes found in London in the late 1800s.  Video game developers are no exception to this, as several titles surrounding the tales of this killer have popped up.  The Adventure Company teamed with Microids recently to bring another rendition - this one venturing outside the norm and bringing Jack the Ripper's gruesome tale to New York City.  The game, appropriately titled Jack the Ripper, takes place in the year 1901, as a young reporter gets the scoop of his life and investigates a series of murders eerily similar to those in London 20 years earlier.  This incarnation is a point and click adventure which is more story than puzzle driven - giving it the feeling of a movie you control rather than a game you play.   As the game begins, you discover you are green reporter James Palmer.  Your new boss has assigned you to get some juicy coverage of the new ~Jack the Ripper~ murders every day - so you head out to investigate and uncover details no other paper might have.  Along the way, you'll meet prostitutes, lounge singers and policemen.  Even Jack himself will take a personal interest in you, sending you mementoes of his kills and involving you even more in the crimes.  The story is fantastically written and moves along well.   There aren't as many puzzles as one might expect, making this is less a puzzle point and click and more a story point and click.  As the reporter, you will be tasked with finding clues and talking to witnesses, much like a police officer might, but with the express intent of getting that top story.  There aren't any wrong choices to make and a day won't progress until you have talked to everyone and found everything you should.  Revisiting scenes and locations will be required often, and sometimes it's not obvious where you should go.  When you get stuck, heading back to a place where there wasn't anything of import might finally yield something.  The puzzles are all pretty logical and make sense within the confines of the game.  Some of them are even entertaining.   Traveling from location is done with the utmost of ease.  Right clicking will bring up a map and clicking on a thumbtack whisks you to that spot.  As information is gathered, new locations are uncovered.  In order to travel to a new spot, it must first be labeled (thus unlocked) by dragging an object onto the thumbtack.  Moving around in locations themselves is done using the mouse - a directional arrow indicates when you can move.  The camera view is first person and looking around is done by moving the mouse to either side of the screen and scrolling.  You can look up and down as well.  The keyboard is almost unnecessary, unless you want to skip a section of dialogue or enter the options menu.  There's no quick save option, but you don't miss it since there's also no real danger.     The graphics are pretty, if not stunning.  The environments are mostly static, with perhaps a person or an object that snaps out - making it obvious what can be interacted with even without the mouse cursor changes.  There are some odd cutscenes that are rather shocking and disturbing, but fit well to enhance the atmosphere of the game.  There isn't any background music really, but sound effects and voice acting are both done supremely well.  I especially liked how the background noise was part of the clues at times, leading you to where you needed to go next.  At the very start, you hear someone faintly calling out for you, in addition to the sound of typewriters and other office type sounds.  It makes it quite realistic.In general, Jack the Ripper is well done adventure story.  The story is intriguing and engaging.  While more puzzles would be expected for games of this style, there are enough to make it a game and the plot is enough to push you through the tale.  Good graphics, fantastic sound effects and a believable narrative mean this is a title to be added to your point and click library, should you be a fan of these games.  If you don't enjoy adventure titles, this one isn't going to make you a believer though.", "date": "Feb 12, 2004"}
