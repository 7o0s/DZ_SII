New Rally-X is a prime example of the kind of arcade classic that works well on mobile. Even if its highly derivative nature (Pac-Man with cars) isn't terribly inspiring, its solid game play mechanics make the move to mobile with decent results.   The motorized maze game pits you in a labyrinth full of flags. There is a small map that shows you where the required flags are located, but does not actually draw out the twisted routes between them. That requires good old-fashioned legwork. You are not alone in the maze, either. Little red rival cars and large stones make you pick and choose your routes. And there better be no lollygagging, either. You have a fuel gauge to consider. Should it run out, your little car goes boom.   On Sprint PCS, New Rally-X is connected to the game lobby. Players can upload scores to a central hub. It's kinda like the old high score board from the arcade cabinets of yore. The game is a fairly faithful representation otherwise. On a Sanyo 8200, the action isn't exactly smooth, but the game hardly sputters to a halt either.  New Rally-X is one of those ~love it or leave it~ games. You either have some fond memories of this top-down maze racer, or you look at it with casual indifference. It works fine as a mobile game, and while I don't expect the fan base to grow as a result of downloading it, New Rally-X should certainly amuse the faithful.", "date": "Sep 12, 2005"}
