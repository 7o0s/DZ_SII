Whether the vehicles hover, roll or splash towards the finish line, the games tend to have a way too much in common.  If competition truly does breed excellence then we may have another entry into the N64 library that won't get all of the attention it would otherwise deserve. For all of the great features and gameplay included in Infogrames' Indy Racing 2000, there just isn't enough truly outstanding or revolutionary about it. Paradigm has developed a game that's very accessible, easy to learn, tough to master and layered with enough depth to eat up your gaming day 30 minutes at a time.

Gameplay Few racers have struck that perfect balance between a racing simulation and arcade fun that N64 fans expect. Realistic games like World Driver Championship or ridiculously arcadey games like something from the San Francisco Rush series succeeded by taking it to the extreme in either direction. Indy Racing 2000 gives us all of the trappings of IRL racing but actually controlling and racing the vehicles themselves is loose, fast and fun.   The control itself is loose compared to the rigid NASCAR '99/2000, but not so bad that you get angry at the game for not giving you a realistic feel for you car. The cars seem to have a mass and physics setup that could exist in the real world. But when you get in hairy situations --and you will in this game-- the hyper daredevil gamers out there will be able to snap the steering wheel back and forth and get the response they want. This isn't to say that you'll recover, mind you, but your vehicle's reactions will be believable.    Likewise the sense of speed is very appealing. Star Wars: Episode I Racer promised near supersonic speeds, but Indy Racing is plenty fast for our tastes. You get a great appreciation for the speed of Indy cars and their souped-up V8s in the regular race modes, but you'll really be able to tell the difference when you race the midget and sprint cars in the game's Gold Cup mode.  The speed and handling of the cars put the racing of IR2000 on the arcade side of the arcade-sim continuum, but there's lots of other stuff that brings this game back to reality.   The real life courses are accurately reproduced as far as we can tell right down to the strip of bricks that serve as the starting line at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. We compared tracks like Atlanta and Texas to their counterparts in other racing games and they were accurate right down to gas sign locations. Of course the abundance of ovals and oval variations in real life Indy Racing is a bit of a downer, but the intensity of the racing action with that arcadey feel makes the most of the situation.  The Championship mode will test your skills as much as you endurance if you don't tinker with the settings. You can choose from short, normal or long seasons, and more importantly you can alter the damage setting. You can either allow for no damage, regular damage --where you'll have to pit to have your car repaired-- or auto fix where your machine will magically fix itself during the course of the race after being affected by the damage for a few seconds. This is important because the A.I. in Indy Racing 2000 is suited for arcade action as well.  We don't profess to be fans of the Indy Racing League, but we seriously doubt those professional drivers would take to bashing into a crafty pilot that just happens to be making a move on the leader. This happens often in the game's championship mode, but it's yet another piece of arcade fun that keeps the game interesting. If you begin to threaten the lead group of cars, not only do you have to maintain your speed, but you have to begin driving defensively. It seems that all of a sudden the dozen or so cars that you've left in your dust will be gunning for you with extra speed to back them up. First place will be a hard fought victory thanks to a little timely aggression and a lot of good luck.   The Gold Cup mode is nice way of adding depth to Indy Racing 2000. Here you'll find midget cars that max out at about 120 mph and handle unlike anything else in the game. You still get your racing crew talking to you by radio and the drafting meter, like the regular game, but these will be all new tracks that require different racing skills. Most of the unlocking that you can do in the game will be done in the Gold Cup mode. There will be plenty of repetition as you try to accumulate points WDC-style.  Graphics Dirt and water. As well as Indy Racing 2000 moves and awes you with its sense of speed, the game looks as muddy as Florida swampland. The blurry textures aren't trying to do too much to begin with as far as realism goes. On top of all this, the game gets choppy at times and this is very noticeable.  To keep in line with the Indy Racing license, the real cars and real drivers all have the appropriate colors and labels and the tracks all have genuine markings and signage. The thing is even with all of this authenticity, you can barely make out that Pennzoil sticker or that Energizer bunny because everything looks so blurry. All of the details are in primary colors however so that one navy blue here looks just like that navy blue there.   It seems that Paradigm has chosen their spots as far as the game's looks and details are concerned. While you'll actually be able to see the Goodyear stamp rotating by quickly on the inside of the tires in first person mode, there aren't enough shadows on the tracks to give any kind of depth to this 3D game. Most of the races are in broad daylight too. This give-and-take in the graphics department is consistent throughout Indy Racing 2000. Take a look at the sharp high resolution driver selection screen and then take a look at crowd in the grandstand to see what we mean.   When we mentioned the crash attack driver A.I., we didn't tell you that the worst part about getting in a wreck isn't just losing your position in the race, it's the awfuly dip in framerate that really irked us. Sure, trying to avoid collisions so that you don't have to suffer through a sluggish framerate is motivation enough, but surely not what Paradigm intended.   Sound A lot better than we expected, the sound elements of Indy Racing add to the game. The announcer gives a nice intro to the track before each race, chock full of information that we didn't know. That same announcer also offers plenty of encouragement throughout the race. We felt closer to him after each and every race.  During the races themselves your crew radios important information that you really should pay attention to. They must be able to see you because they let you know when to draft and when to slingshot around other racers. They'll tell you when you're coming up on a pack of other cars and when you're going to encounter unimportant lap cars. Very good application of the N64's limited sound abilities.  Indy Racing 2000, even with its problems ended up being a game that looks, feels and plays better than any of its preview screenshots suggested. It has strong ~pick-up-and-playability,~ and that's always important in our books. Fans of Indy Racing should be pleased by the authentic drivers, cars and sponsors, but more importantly, N64 racing fanatics should be surprised by how fun this game is. There are definitely a strong handful of racers available for the system that are better, but IR2000 definitely has enough going for it to stand on its own. The cartridge comes with half a dozen save files for both the career mode and the Gold Cup mode, so you can toss that controller pak out of your window. Also Infogrames only wants $40 for the game. Maybe they make it up on the exchange rate. In any case, all of this adds up to quite a bargain and if you can forgive the persistent muddiness and focus on the exciting gameplay, you'll be satisfied with your purchase of this racer.", "date": "Jun 27, 2000"}
