There were a couple worth playing though, like Post Mortem and Dark Fall: The Journal. Cyan Worlds also recently released Uru: Ages Beyond Myst, which is always a truly great adventure. However, there were a lot more sub-par adventures that good ones released this year.   In comes Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon, released on The Adventure Company's label and developed by Revolution Software, who has released two other Broken Sword adventures prior to this one. The Sleeping Dragon is the third in this series, but newcomers won't have to worry about not having played the previous incarnations. This is definitely a stand-alone adventure.   It all starts in the Congo, as George Stobbart, a patent lawyer from Idaho, flies out to meet a client. He arrives just in time to see his would-be client shot. Miles away, in Paris, reporter Nicole Collard is working a case - and her timing is just as impeccable. As she arrives to meet someone who has a story he wants to tell her about the end of the world, she hears gunshots and breaks into the apartment to find her informant dead. This is the beginning of a story which eventually leads long time friends George and Nico to reunite and save the world - something they've done together before.  All of the characters in the story have interesting tales to tell. Perhaps the most interesting comes in the form of Bruno, an ex-Templar (yes, as in the holy group of knights who became extremely powerful and were eventually wiped out by the inquisition when they angered the king). Of course, for the sake of this tale, the Templars were never extinguished, they only went underground. Back to Bruno - he comes into the story and helps George find the truth about the murder of the scientist he was to meet. He is a compelling character and the choices he makes in the game may actually bring a tear to your eye. It is rare that a game can do that.    The puzzles are a mixed bag. There are a lot of original puzzles here and none of them are overly complex. They also fit well with the story and actually make sense. However, the crate puzzles are over the top. By the end of the game, I was actually saying ~Not again!~ when I found yet another crate puzzle. If you don't know what a crate puzzle is, it is a puzzle that requires you to push and pull boxes into place so you can reach a high spot or travel across a gap. A few of these well placed into the story are great. Too many are just annoying, and that is what this game has of those, too many. However, the rest of the puzzles to redeem this aspect of the game, with some that make you think and others that you just must be persistent in to defeat.  The next topic of discussion would normally be movement, but I can't really start on this topic until I discuss the horrible interface - they are tied into each other closely. The first odd thing you'll notice is that you cannot use the mouse. This game itself on the surface appears to be a point and click adventure, but the point and click is glaringly absent. All the keyboard controls can be customized, but this doesn't make them any easier to use. Anyone at all familiar with console games will immediately recognize how easy the controls would work using a controller.  All actions are selected by pushing one of four keys assigned to a bubble menu (imagine what the four main buttons on a console controller looks like and you understand what I'm saying). Standard movement is mapped to the arrow keys, but jumping, climbing and using items are done using the action menu. So, there are some action style components to the game without the action style control. The interface detracts a great deal from the game and it never really becomes natural.    The graphics are really well done. They are bright, cheery and cartoonish. Cut scenes are well placed and add a great deal to the story. The animation is also a bright spot. Incredible voice acting dominates this game, though, outshining the graphics and story by far. From Nico's French accent to George's believable ~Yankee Lawyer~ silliness, it is a pleasure to listen to the game. Sound effects are appropriately done as well.Cartoonish graphics, incredible voice acting and an engrossing story all make this a game to look at, that is - if you can get past the horrible interface and somewhat repetitive block puzzles.  Finishing the game also has a reward associated with it, in addition to the impressive ending.  This is something far too few PC games do.  The ending left it open enough for the next incarnation of Broken Sword - the adventures of George and Nico.  I just would ask one thing of the developers - please improve the interface and skip the block puzzles!  Those are the two things preventing this from being the perfect adventure game.", "date": "Nov 25, 2003"}
