It's time to put down the mouse, get up out of that chair, head down to your local videogame retailer, and finally put down the money for a NeoGeo Pocket Color. Once you wrap your paws around the system and give SNK vs. Capcom: Match of the Millenium a whirl, you'll finally experience why the system should co-exist with the dominating force that is the Game Boy Color. This is portable fighting at its finest.Features Fighter featuring characters from SNK and Capcom games Dreamcast link compatible Link-cable support for two players For NeoGeo Pocket ColorMatch of the Millenium is essentially a combination fighter, mixing two of the industries biggest 2D fighting champions in one single game. You want to know who's in the game? Here's the initial list:There are other characters to uncover, but you've gotta find them first. And that's a lot of the fun right there.Don't expect much of a departure in terms of a fighting engine from the existing fighters on the system  in fact, Match of the Millennium utilizes the same graphics engine as Fatal Fury, Samurai Shodown, and King of Fighters R2. In other words, you're going to get super-deformed fighters, and a letterboxed arena (black bars cropping off the top and bottom of the playing field. It might sound like I'm slamming the game, but in reality these two elements work extremely well for the style of game Match of the Millenium offers. The black bars might be a programming cheat to get the game to flow smooth and fast, but they also make it easy to see the health bar at the top and the power bars the bottom. The super-deformed style also suits the game, since it's a fighter in pocket form  besides, these characters have been squashed and squeezed before, whether it's from Super Puzzle Fighter or Pocket Fighters from Capcom, or the existing fighting games on the NeoGeo Pocket Color. In other words, goofy as it looks, the game feels very natural.This doesn't mean that the game looks just like the other fighters on the system. Not by a longshot. Existing SNK characters have been given an overhaul with somewhat more detail (they're slightly larger than their existing counterparts) and more frames of animation. The only real downside to the graphics is the fact that only one character, Zangief, has flesh-toned skin  all the rest are as white as albinos. You can really see the sprite color limitation of the system in this game, since most characters only consist of four or less colors (white, black, and the occasional splash of detail). But the backgrounds and cutscenes are absolutely gorgeous and are dripping with vibrancy. You might remember a few backgrounds that have been given the handheld treatment, like Ryu's stage for example. And many backgrounds are also given life through a bit of animation, like candles flickering or the neon signs cycling through their lights. The minor details given are astounding.And the gameplay? Hoo, brother  got a few hours? The game is basically broken down into two segments  the fighting game, and the extras that append to the fighting game. The single player game is a multi-match fighting game that takes you through the game's silly storyline, and up to the fight against a mutant Ryu or Iori. Each character has his or her own rival that will jump in at the middle of the ~quest~ for a little one-match one-on-one (and that same character wraps up the storyline for each of the fighters..and trust me when I say that the tiny plots can get a little confusing). Fights can be the familiar best-of-three battles, a one-match brawl, a two-on-two tag-team battle where you can have either fighter jump in at any time, or a three-on-three team match. There are a few one-on-two and one-on-three bouts that show up in the one-player mode, but it's a set order and you'll know exactly when they show up after a couple plays through. At the end of the game, the computer will randomly punch out a number of squares from a nine-tile grid  if you reveal the entire picture underneath, you earn that character. This is another clever way SNK gets gamers to keep playing its games  the only way you're going to reveal these characters is if you keep playing.The fighting technique of the game is an amalgamation of moves from both SNK and Capcom, but the controls are very Capcom-esque. Because the NeoGeo only has two action buttons (an obvious design flaw right from the start  especially when it's named after a console system with FOUR buttons), moves are sensitive to how long you hold the kick or punch button. The longer you hold it, the stronger (and slower) the move. This mimics the three punch/three kick buttons of the Capcom style fighter, and this has been moved somewhat to the SNK fighters as well. The only complaint comes from the cycloid controller on the system  it's not easy to find the diagonals for the jump-in or out movement, since you have to guess where the midpoint contacts are on that joystick. You can also pull off power combo moves as you take on hits or you nail your opponent  much like the Alpha combos of Street Fighter Alpha. The only thing I really miss is the icon that tells you how you KO'ed your opponent.The game also features an ~Olympic Mode.~ Here's where the game gets milked even further  pick a team (SNK or Capcom) and compete in seven different events. Think you can go up against 100 one-round fights? How many opponents can you defeat in the 10-round, one-hit-KO challenge? How long will it take you to beat five opponents? There are also four unique mini-games that are tailored for the two teams  the Capcom games feature a cool Ghost 'n Goblins task where you must hop back and forth grabbing treasure, and a Dance Dance Revolution style-challenge where you have Felicia groove to the rhythm. The SNK challenges put you in a Metal Slug mini-game where you try and take out alien UFOs (which really look like naked women's breasts...I'm not kidding), as well as the Samurai Shodown stage bonus where you hack down practice dummies in a dojo. These mini-games are small, but they add so much to the replay value of this fighting cartridge. More options means more play time.And just like almost EVERY NeoGeo Pocket Color game on the market, Match of the Millennium also features link-cable support. Two player matches are where it's at, folks. If this game doesn't make you try and find a buddy with a system, nothing will. You can create your own personal character (from the existing library of fighters, natch), and give that character his or her own specific win quote  what a way to stick it to your buddy when you win...As far as I'm concerned, this is the perfect handheld fighter, no question about it. The Capcom license gives players a familiar feel as well as introducing newcomers to the SNK library of fighters. The game isn't exactly a challenge right off the bat  but once you move the difficulty setting from Normal to Hard (there's two more after that: Brutal and Gamer), good luck. The computer AI can get downright nasty. And the Olympic mode really puts your Street Fighter abilities to test  let's just see how far you can get. SNK just keeps doing the right stuff with its portable...let's hope the Capcom tradition continues. The Ghouls 'N Ghosts minigame just BEGS to be converted into the full-fledged game. Let's have it, people...", "date": "Jan 5, 2000"}
