Back then, you were spending your time traipsing through large robot mines trying to rescue human hostages (why were they there in the first place?) between blowing up rabid robots and nuclear reactors. Years later, Descent 3's arrived, and while you're still blowing up robots, everything else about it has gotten much more complicated, in a good way.   Where the first two Descents were just ~blow stuff up~ games, this one has a strong story that works itself well into gameplay. You're a Material Defender, a mercenary law enforcement officer that gets rescued by private parties in a very Sigourney Weaver Aliens manner, and tasked with discovering a solution behind the very virus that causes robots to go berserk.    As a result, your tactics and objectives are much tighter this time around. Each level has specific objectives to meet devoted to pushing the story forward -- while they're still essentially ~find and tag~ objectives, they make the level design a lot more believable. When you're invading Phobos Prison, you feel like you're invading Phobos Prison. Levels incorporate interior and exterior environments that are some of the biggest I've ever seen. Sometimes you're investigating caverns so large you'll need to litter it with flares before you can tell where you need to go, and valleys that feel like the Grand Canyon. If you've got enough horsepower, the graphics are the next best thing to being there.   Besides graphics and level design, Descent 3 has a host of improvements. Enemy AI is smart enough to be scary -- it'll dodge, ambush, and swarm you in a manner that's unnerving. Well-produced environmental sounds enhance the graphics. The automap works better than I expected, and so does the guidebot. Everything about this game is quality work. If it just didn't have these ungodly loading times, there'd be nothing to complain about.   Well, that's not quite true. One thing that bugs me a lot about this game is that it's trying to drive high-bandwidth connections. Every time you load it up, it tries to connect to the Internet, which is annoying for everybody who still uses a modem. And multiplayer mode is nigh-unplayable over a 56K connection, with ping times chunking up to 3000+ milliseconds when even one other player comes on screen. There are some compromises you can make to speed up the connection, but unless you're on local or DSL, it may not be worth it.   If you've plunked down the cash for a high-end machine and graphics card, though, Descent 3 will make you glad you did.    Editor's Note: a lot of readers have written in about their own experience playing Descent 3 over a modem. Many readers report that improving ping and playability over a 56k modem can be accomplished by trying lots of different servers before settling into a game. In fact, the overwhelming majority of reader write ins about this game is that despite the reviewer's connection problems, that the game does in fact play very well over 56k. As lag can be such an individualized problem, we wanted to note that many readers do enjoy Descent III over a modem. It is also worth noting that despite the reviewer's difficulty with modem gaming that Descent 3 still received a 9 out of 10.", "date": "Jun 7, 2002"}
