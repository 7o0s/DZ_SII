The idea is to capture their imaginations without insulting their immature intelligence (surprisingly, most kid games, like Punky Skunk, fail the second test). It probably has never really been done well, particularly on a console like the PlayStation.  Tiny Toon's Toonenstein makes a good case that a good child's videogame can be done. Not that Toonenstien itself is a really good game -- it's story and challenges are so complicated that the game will probably frustrate young gamers. But it doesn't make the same mistakes that other games marketed towards children have. Rather than dumbing down the controls of a half-baked platformer, the game was specifically tailored towards the very youngest of gamers, with marvelous animated graphics and Warner cartoon sound effects, and a simple control scheme to allow kiddies to access its wondrous sights easily. Story & Gameplay  Set up in the game's slyly written intro sequence (and yet somehow still never fully explained), the game follows the exploits of Plucky Duck and his porker pal Hamton as they make a call on Toonenstein Mansion in answer to an ad requesting, ~WANTED: MEN WITH BIG BRAINS, WILL PAY TOP DOLLAR~. It seems that greedy little Plucky is willing to risk the danger of being caught by the fearful Baroness Toonenstein (played by the even more fearful Elmyra) and have his brain sucked into a robot monster, as long as there is cash involved.  For some reason, players do not control either Plucky or Hampton. Instead, you guide Elmyra's cat Furrball (who is also looking to escape the Baroness' clutches) through the game's 36 locations. The mansion is divided into four floors, plus a basement level where the treasure vault is kept. Furrball's goal on each stage is to turn on each one of a floor's electrical actuators so that the elevator will have enough power to take you to another floor. Along the way, you'll have to find codes to the vault's lock, track down Hampton whenever he gets scared and runs away (which is about once per floor), avoid Elmyra by ducking into Acme exits, and battle Bombats.    Control is very simple, as you don't directly control Furrball. Instead, the game gives you a set of choices for each location depending upon what's in the room (go one room left or right, go upstairs, ring for an elevator, trigger an actuator), and gameplay consists mostly of pushing in the corresponding key on the PlayStation pad. It's a very simple scheme that seems almost too simple, but the idea behind the design is that at least you don't have to fidget around with exploring everything in a given location like you would in, say, King's Quest. Instead, the game presents children with every choice possible in a room, and all they have to do is make up their minds and push the particular button. It's very simple, and the actual programming behind the gameplay is also very simple (for instance, when Elmyra says she's chasing you, she's really just stationed in a random room waiting for you to accidentally step there, so she doesn't show up if you don't move). Yet even though the game is simple and not too involving, kids will still get the visceral thrill of the being on an adventure as they search the mansion and run from trouble.  There are two weird quirks with the one-button gameplay here that may make kids a little disoriented at times. One issue is that rooms aren't all completely circular, and some of the areas have walls or chains that Furrball will walk around. The problem is that if you press left to go from one room to another, and the next room is above and to the right of your current room, Furrball will come in from the left instead of stage right. Now if you press left again to go to the next room, Furrball will instead follow the stage directions and walk back to the room you were just in. It's confusing, and some kids may think that there's only two rooms on a floor, so they'll leave without fully exploring a stage. The other is that the game, while easy to finish if you know what you're doing and keep passwords often, lets you lose the game and see a bad ending. To me, it's a bit much for a little kid to go through the entire game and finally get caught by Elmyra after freeing the monster. Thankfully, this is the only point in the game where losing out to Elmyra is actually fatal, (OK, not fatal  Plucky and Hamton get their brains sucked out), but it would be a heartbreaker for a little kid to get all the way there and suddenly lose it all. (My other complaint is that the good ending isn't very special at all, so kids might as well get that bad ending and save themselves some time). These are small issues that may frustrate children, but shouldn't keep them off the trail of their quest for long.  The single deviation in this click-along formula is in the battles with the Bombats (giant bombs and sticks of dynamite with wings), which occur at least once on every floor. At points when Bombats are chasing you, find a Bombat Disabler Gun and start shooting. The game switches to a stationary sniper-cam view, as you target the wild Bombats and disarm them with green goo. Again, not terribly complicated, but it does lend some action to an otherwise passive adventure.  But what really hooks kids in this game isn't the adventure quest, or even the shooting gallery mini-game. It's the actuators, the electrical interfaces that Furrball must turn on to power the elevator. Each one of these actuators is connected in some way to one of the Baroness' bizarre science experiments, and so clicking an actuator will always trigger some strange, silly sequence. Turn on one in the kitchen, and you may fire toast into an incinerator. Trigger one in a graveyard, and a tiny Elvis will rise from the grave and play his guitar. Strike up the evil waffle iron, and he'll eat a pancake-batter ghost. Activate the rock-em sock-em robots and they'll duke it out for a few slugs. There are even a few that use classic Warner trademarks and are specially for the big kids -- one actuator sends the Batmobile out on  a mission, another has a Death Star-like object blasting a toy Star Trek Enterprise. These sequences don't add a thing to the actual gameplay, but they add a ton to a child's experience with the game. Kids like to see things move and jump and make funny noises, and this game delivers that. They get to make the game do something neat. Imagine these activator sequences as the FMV effects sequences in Final Fantasy, and you'll understand why children would want to play this game.  Graphics The other main attraction for children to this game, besides the Tiny Toons characters and the delightfully animated actuator sequences, is the beautiful graphic style and presentation. Areas are all lovingly rendered, and though they are computer rendered scenes, they have a hand-made painterly quality to them. Detail is imaginative and fantastic -- one scene has a doctor's chair with an oversized eye hovering above, another scene has an elaborate pipe organ, which is played by a goofy looking witch (watch for her to throw back her cape as she sets to play, and her polka-dot knickers show underneath the  cape). Every floor has a handful of themes -- the bottom floor alone has a dingy basement, an Acme-inspired industrial vault, and a twisted graveyard complete with roach motel (only ghosts live here now). Rooms also feature a great deal of animation even when nothing is going on. A snake plant will begin to move seductively just after you enter the jungle room. In the aquarium room, a diver bobs listlessly in a fishtank. And all along your adventure, Elmyra's Electric Eyes peep on you when you're not paying attention.   The 3D nature of the areas is preserved in the transitions from room to room. Here, they have borrowed Square's technique of blending pre-rendered backgrounds with FMV (like the opening train sequence in Final Fantasy VII). Every time Furrball leaves a room, the camera swoops and lurches as it moves on to the next room. The camera also launches up stairs and swings around into the elevator. It's a very impressive effect, and it gives the game life and appeal that more flat games like X-Files or Chef's Love Shack just can't pull off.  Characters in the game, in contrast to the backgrounds, are drawn and  animated in traditional 2D animation (Furrball has some 3D modeling going on, but he looks and moves just like his cartoon counterpart). The style mixes phenomenally with the backgrounds, as the characters stand out from the backdrops without looking pasted on. Not only are they drawn in the classic Warner style (with only a couple hitches in the smoothness and motion transitions), but they also are designed to work with the backgrounds without bogging down the game. For instance, instead of walking down a flight of stairs (which would require new character animation for that individual sequence), Furrball simply darts down the stairs faster than we can see him move, leaving behind only a cartoon puff of smoke to let us know he's taken off).   This elegance in design makes for a game that looks and moves beautifully, yet has almost no issues with load time. Only the Bombat battles require a loading screen, likely because they foolishly require the engine to load all three types of Bombat instead of just the particular type of Bombat you are fighting. (Unfortunately, Bombat gameplay sequences, while clear and high in resolution and animation, just don't look good enough to justify that load.) The only other thing I could possibly wish for in the graphics department would be the inclusion of more of the Tiny Toons characters. After seeing how  good Hamton, Plucky, Elmyra, and Byron the Devil Dog looked in the game, I wished the rest of the Tiny Toons gang had made a cameo somewhere. Sound The sound in this game is handled quite well. Of course, all of the voices from the show are present in the game, so you'll hear Elmyra's grating voice throughout your adventure. (Incidently, Hamton is played by Futurama's Billy West.) My favorite voice, however, is a new voice not from the show  -- the daft elevator operator with the thick irish accent, Willy, must have his words translated by the computerized elevator because his words are simply unintelligible.  Culled from the Warner Bros.' massive sound effects library, the cartoon sounds of this game are fantastic. From the bleeps and bloops of machinery, to the growl and moans of ghosts, to the zips and boinks of the cartoon characters, the classic Warner sounds are all distinctive and imaginatively used. For instance, the old canned ~Yippie, Yahoo!~ sound (which you've heard in about a million different cartoons over the years) is used for when the mini Texan ghost rides his seahorse. There's also the generic airplane buzz noise and the register ca-ching.   Music is also inventively used, with each room having its own distinctive musical cue. Each floor has a musical pattern that goes with the theme (for instance, the aquarium has light harp plucks, while the upstairs lab has heavy, brassy music), and each room plays a variation on that theme. The music is looped, which is audibly looping and sometimes even irritating, but at least the theme is consistent and the tracking is done well. I especially like the music cues that go along with some of the actuators. For instance, one sequence has a charger zapping a battery, then waving its lead wires in the air in a victory dance to a wubba-wubba-wubba song it sings. It's very funny and quite charming, and that kind of magic happens quite a bit in the game.  COMMENT   Toonenstein does a lot to try to bewitch children gamers. There's nothing stunning in the gameplay, but there's also no great difficulty that would stop kids from playing all the way through. And while they are playing through, they'll be treated to exquisite and original sequences that may get them to giggle. The only problem would be that the gameplay is so uninvolved that children may simply reject such simplicity. Kids are smarter than most game designers think they are. They may not be able to win a Mario game, but they can move him around and make him do funny things. That doesn't happen here, and older tykes may be put off this game pretty quickly.At least Tiny Toon's Toonenstein doesn't mistake kids for idiots. The lack of gameplay isn't a fault, it's just a limitation of the design, and an intentional limitation at that. The game never even pretends to be educational -- X's mark the spot for actuators, but you press the square button to activate them. Click-through story games like If You Give A Mouse A Cookie... pioneered this type of gameplay on the PC, and that worked well at getting preschoolers to move a mouse. Toonenstein may be able to do the same for PlayStation babies. If not, I hope Terra Glyph, the game's developer and animator, stays with the kids market (although it seems as if this game was a calling card to show their use of technology for higher profile licenses like X-Files -- their corporate logo pops up twice in the opening sequence and also in the ending). The team there certainly does seem to have a good handle on how to make something simple and yet wonderful. Now if only they could couple that with some fun gameplay for all ages, they would really have something great.", "date": "Dec 8, 1999"}
