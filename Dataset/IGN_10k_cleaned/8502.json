Easily accessible skill-games thrown at the player at a lightning pace? Seems like a perfect for the gaming platform that champions one-button or casual games play. But so far, two micro-game contests have hit the wall with a wet thud -- Gameloft's Spring Break: Cancun Gone Wild and Vivendi's Crash Bandicoot Party Games. Is it time to thrown in the towel, or is this more of a matter of execution than mismatched concepts?   Party Games certainly has its heart in the right place -- branding a series of fast-paced games with a roster of familiar, colorful characters. Unfortunately, very few of the games Crash and his friends (Coco, Cortex, etc.) star in are winning enough to make you inflate your cellphone bill. Some, if fact, are downright duds, such as the Cow Shoot mini-game where you jam on the OK key to raise some crosshairs up to a moving bovine. Infernal Tower is another poor contest, where you simply drop boxes on to a sliding platter. Good Sight tries to take on the brain training phenom by having you count colorful dragons, but the screen becomes such a mess of scales and wings, it's more like a guessing game. Mobile Phone Thief asks you to hit the OK button as fast as you can after a present is opened -- that's it. Finally, the worst of the bunch is Baseball, where you must swing at some crazy curveball. The timing is so off that it feels more than a coin flip than a skill-based game of reflexes.   Fatal Opening is one of the better games. It's a contest where you must hit a buzzer at gently as possible, lest you be the player that raises a cage door and releases a dragon. But the ratio of passable to pitiful is just too off-balance.   The game offers a single-player mode for trying out the micro-games before jumping into the pass-and-play and all-hands-on-deck multiplayer. You can select up to four human players, select characters, and then set the number of points required to win. (Each successful mini-game adds points to score.) A wheel spins between games to choose who does what and can even offer rules that hamper performance, such as requiring the next gamer to play with the hand they normally don't use.   Crash Bandicoot Party Games isn't much of a party. The game -- save for that wonky baseball micro-game -- is completely functional, but the mini-games just aren't much fun. But I believe this genre can work on mobile and I'd actually like to see Vivendi try out an entirely new set of micro-games. The first publisher that nails the execution will have a real winner on their hands.", "date": "May 21, 2007"}
