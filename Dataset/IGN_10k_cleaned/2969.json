Criterion has created various games, all with different degrees of notoriety, including Trickstyle, Airblade, and the most respectable of the bunch, Burnout. Following up on its first racer on PlayStation 2, Criterion's Burnout 2: Point of Impact takes the game to a several new levels of playability, graphic prowess and studied presentation.   Burnout 2 is a sparkling example of pure, refined arcade racing done right. It's instantly accessible, it's the fastest looking racer on PlayStation 2, and most of all it offers the best car crashes on the planet. When I glance at the huge roster of racing games on PS2 these days, only one still stands out as a genuinely memorable keeper, Gran Turismo 3: A-spec. Yes, a few others are worth owning. But I'm talking about standout quality that still screams at you from the shelf. Well, now you have another one to keep you up late nights, Burnout 2.   The Basics  One of the prominent gameplay complaints hampering the original Burnout was its brevity (we'll get to graphics in a bit). Criterion listened and has responded. In this sequel, there are six locations and 32 stages, including more US spots (Rocky Mountains, Los Angeles, New Mexico, an international airport, and more), 21 different cars, and the ability to customize your own vehicles. The designers have mapped courses using green-lit gates that, later on the game, shift, opening up newer sections of that same course.    Likewise, boosts have been bolstered and improved. Players earn them by driving as close to other vehicles as possible, with higher points given to nearly missing oncoming traffic. The object is still to get close, but not to touch. Players also earn boosts by drifting and jumping. The ~Offensive Driving 101~ mode (a tutorial) helps to build your skills by offering bronze, silver or gold trophies for those who perform well.   Burnout 2 features familiar and new cars this time around. The lineup highlights a strange mix of vehicles from various countries and vintages, including 1920s cars, Japanese muscle cars, NASCAR cars, 1950s hot rods, stock cars, pickups, SUVs and police cars. None of them are licensed, of course, but many of them are clear replicas of very specific makes. And there are seven secret cars in addition to the 14 regulars. One of the best cars is a high-performance student-driver car. Nice one, fellas.    In much the way Reflections Studios was able to build an entire game around a singular idea with Driver, Criterion has stretched its arcade racer canvas to cover several deft modes of play in Burnout 2. It includes Championship (the career mode, featuring a variety of races, such as championships, single races and chase), Single race (a single race), Time Attack (post your best time), Crash (an excellent new addition), Chase(a cop-chase mode) and Offensive Driving 101 (training). The heart of the game is Championship, and as you progress through it, many new cars and at least one new mode is unlocked.    Gameplay  The first Burnout was shrouded in mystery. In many ways it was a hidden gem people never discovered, even if they played it. Packaged with original underground features, Burnout wasn't presented in a way that many gamers noticed. It was like an idea fully formed, but not delivered properly, not delivered with great panache or clarity. Burnout 2 is that full idea, fleshed out and presented with gamers in mind. The game commences with drivers training which shows you how to earn your stripes, then progresses to offer an assorted buffet of highly focused high-octane races, chases and crash courses. You learn how to boost (the turbo charge shown on the meter on the lower left side of the screen), and how to manage burnouts (when you lose all turbo power). In essense, you learn the requisite tools of the Burnout trade.   Since the idea is to drive as fast and as recklessly as possible, the training demonstrates how to do it with clarity. You learn to drift, drive against traffic properly (yes, properly), and take jumps amidst the six-part session. It's quite easy, but it helps to know exactly what to do when you're racing at these speeds. As a way to vary the game's qualities across its core mode Championship, Criterion staggers the kinds of races.   For example, players race through the first series (three courses), then they engage in a head-to-head race against a car (in this case a hot rod, which if you beat, you win), after which a Chase session occurs. The chase gives players the chance to ram a cop car against a rampaging driver within a limited area. The next race is a four course Championship, the next five, etc.    While Burnout 2 is in many ways just a more refined, polished, better presented version of Burnout -- which, by the way, is a good thing here -- Criterion has not only organized its game better, it's added sparse but intensely addictive modes of play. Crash is a mini-game that's as addicting as Survival was in Reflections' PlayStation game. The goal is simple: Drive down a strip of road and crash into the oncoming traffic in the attempt to cause as much damage as possible. That's right, go for the coolest, most uproarious collision you can. It's a strict he-man chest-beating affair, but oh, is it good fun. Each vehicle (cars, trucks, 18-wheelers, busses, etc.,) has monetary value attributed to it: Hitting busses and trucks are worth more than mere civilian cars, but hitting busses, trucks and cars, as many as possible -- causing domino effects and collateral damage -- grants players multipliers. Cause $5 million in damage with a multiplier of 5 and you earn $25 million in damage. Ah, lovely, lovely multipliers.   There is an unofficial contest occurring in our office right now to see who can earn the highest collision points, and right now it's $24 million in damage. That takes some hard work, too, my friends. But anyway, while Crash is a single-player game, it's designed entirely to play with against friends. This is serious replay value right here, and some folks here in the office have only just played that mode alone and love the game. Chase is also good fun, enabling players to chase out-of-control madmen as a cop. You chase the bad guys and continually crash into their cars until they die. This kind of game can be found in various Need for Speed versions and of course, in Driver 1 & 2. It's good fun, but not quite the howling-kicking-scream of joy that Crash is.   For those who simply love to drive and who need know how the game controls Burnout 2 feels just like Burnout, but faster and ever so slightly tighter. The game rarely, if ever, drops a frame, smoking at a smooth 60 fps -- a key element to making a fast, insane racer work -- and in the cockpit view, the rush of speed is unrivaled. The cars still stick to the road like glue, with a slight magnetic disposition, and the solid, arcade control provides the supernatural ability to swerve in between cars going at speeds of more than 150 mph on a regular basis.    And players will need to learn every one of their training skills (OK, six isn't that many) to succeed on these courses. One course in particular (a hilly alpine track) requires drivers to use the drift with as much skill as possible because there are so few cars on it that nearly all of your boost power comes from drifting alone. As for the rest of the tracks, they're good, but not great. More tracks would have been better and better-designed tracks would have made this an even better title.    The biggest complaint I have with Burnout 2 is that while it does indeed offer more variety than last year's effort, it doesn't fully exploit its own best attributes. Drifts and close-car traffic jams are well backed. But jumps are practically non-existent. Yes, the framerate rocks, the control is excellent, and the game trumps last year's effort with special effects and graphics, but the potential for unbelievable jump and crash sequences are so ripe, and the opportunities so missed, I grind my teeth just thinking about it.   Also, while the game offers the chance to color your car, the desire to custom tune and modify your car's parts is sorely missing. No, this game doesn't have to feature custom modification, even if it is fun as hell, but these cars all drive incredibly alike. They're all fast, they all grip well, yadda, yadda. While variation is key to Burnout 2's increased attraction, the game doesn't go far enough.   Graphics  Not as much of a problem on GameCube or Xbox, the PS2 version of the first Burnout was riddled with aliasing problems and shimmering annoyances. But Burnout 2 is a text-book case in a developer outsmarting the PlayStation 2's complicated design and satellite pockets of RAM, and making the game work perfectly. The game runs at a solid 60 fps throughout and what's more, Criterion has upped the ante in every visual department. And for those who love their technology, Criterion has delivered a technically savy game for you: Progressive scan TV support is fully supported on the PlayStation 2 version.   The texture work on the backgrounds, which usually zip by ever so fast they're hardly worth noticing, are highly ornamented and interesting to see here. The cars vary in texture work. With the exception of the later custom models, a few of the old time models, and the faux-NASCAR, the cars are still basic in design and texture-mapped with the most simplistic of sheaths. They all sport a metallic sheen as well as offering healthy doses of realtime reflections, specular highlighting, and Bloom lighting (a difficult-to-get effect showing off particular sun reflections and glare ample) to produce that attractive new car shine.    This year's special effects are most admirable. The car damage models appear nearly endless in their destructible manifestations. Vehicles take more damage than before, and it shows. Hoods, tires, wheels, roofs, trunks, windows, fenders -- even the car's frame -- are all subject to destruction. Engines catch on fire and smoke, and sparks flare up at any point of metal-to-metal impact. Hit a rail and a spray of sparks rooster tail across the screen. Hit another car and several smoking, pluming parts arch into the sky like a Fourth of July fireworks display, followed by a tastefully displayed cutscene. Car fenders, glass, chunks of metal, and hundreds of bits explode from the point of contact, creating a satisfying scene of wreckage and healthy destruction. In short, it's all good.   Sound  Two aspects from the sound department make the game worthwhile to listen to. When you change gears or hit turbo or screech across a wide turn, the sound effects for each incident are clear and telling. You practically feel the turbo running through your hands as the car bursts out in front of you, but the sound effect is right there, loud and whirling, making sure the effect is not missed. It's a little overdone, but I think that's the point. Afterall, the game is a bit overdone, and the extra loud car sounds capture the game's afterburner essence perfectly.    The second thing that works well is the action-oriented music. The hard-rocking music ebbs and flows with the game's fluctuating speedometer changes. Pre-turbo, the chankity-chank of the guitar slips right in between that ZZ Top and AC DC vibe, and then when you hit turbo, wham! The volume is turned up several notches to parallel the intensity of the drive. The music itself is straightforward, hard-grinding guitar, drums and bass, but the fluid dynamic change in tempo has a great effect on the driving experience.    Again, those for who like their top-quality sound and vision, Criterion supports Dolby ProLogic II for excellent, clear and crisp sound quality.In all, Burnout 2 is an excellent sequel in every way. It's better looking, longer, faster, deeper, and it's got little flourishes and extra modes of play that truly impress. In the larger picture, Criterion's racer is a top-notch arcade game in its own right. It stands right up there with the best PS2 racers in its own unique, destructive, high-octane way. However, Burnout isn't the longest game I have ever played, and the game could use a lot more variation, more jumps, more cross-traffic areas and more variety. In fact, with regard to length, I played through the tutorial, beat the first championship season, and played through one whole championship set of courses twice (to get all golds) -- and saw the credits -- within a three-hour period. The championship mode isn't that long the first time around. But then I opened up the Custom Series Championship, which is much tougher than the others. And I hadn't spent nearly as much time playing Crash as the other kids in the office. (Though I am making up for it now.) So, in all, it's a relatively long game, with some modes being longer than others. Burnout 2 should have huge appeal. It's a straightforward bullet of a racer. If you want the sheer thrill of speed and the intensity of the best car crashes on the planet, go get yourself a copy.", "date": "Sep 24, 2002"}
