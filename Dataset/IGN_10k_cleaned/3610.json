It all started a few years back, hot off the heels of Pixar's blockbuster Toy Story CG flick.  The idea to create a game franchise that revolves around the toy universe of our favorite green, plastic, childhood heroes was interesting at the time, and 3DO hasn't stopped cranking out sequel after sequel ever since.  The problem with the franchise isn't the concept, because, to be honest, we love the concept.  We grew up with buckets full of green and tan troops littered in the sandbox just like everyone else.  The problem is that 3DO's Army Men videogame titles have been hit or miss throughout the years -- and sadly, mostly misses.  So, whenever we get the latest Army Men title here in the offices, we're careful to check our skepticism at the door and give it a fair look, because the 3DO development team has certainly surprised us in the past.  In fact, the original Air Combat game was a fairly respectable little action title back in its day on the N64.  But that was three years ago on a system that shipped with roughly 4 MB of RAM.  Today, our expectations are slightly higher. Oddly enough, this second Air Combat title in the series feels more like a three year-old re-release than a second-generation enhancement.  The Facts:   Pilot five different helicopters, each with different weapons payloads and handling  Play through 20 single-player missions or with friends in one of five multi-player modes  Ten distinct environments, including Japanese Garden, Halloween Night, Wild West, Flower Bed, and more   Toy-inspired weapons range from bottle rockets to cherry bombs  Pick up objects with each helicopter's tow line to swing them at enemies or to reel-in power-ups  Requires six blocks of Memory Card space for saved data, or save campaign progress via a simple password system  For one or two players simultaneous  Gameplay The time has finally come to welcome the first Army Men title to the GameCube.  The only catch here is that Air Combat on GCN is pretty much the exact same Air Combat game that we got back on the N64 with minor enhancements to earn the ~Elite Missions~ tag. It even hit the Sony consoles under a slightly different name (Air Attack 2) a couple years back, and so the circle is now complete.  The only serious drawback to being the last console on the release list is the two to three year wait that has passed in the meantime.  Time has not been kind to this game, and it shows in many ways.  As most have gathered by now, Air Combat puts players in control of one of several different toy helicopters flying combat-intensive missions against the evil tan army.  The action is viewed in a slightly skewed overhead angle that keeps the focus centered on threats immediately nearby the helicopter, and it works for the most part.  There are no manual camera controls, as the C stick only serves to toggle on and off the overhead map in the corner of the screen.  The C stick isn't even used to strafe left and right as it was on the PS2, but the Cube's L and R triggers are comfortable enough to slip and slide around the battlefield.  Each of the four unique helicopters feels slightly different in the air, but all control noticeably poor.  Turning left and right with the analog stick aggravates with its sluggish pace and prevents players from being quick enough to actually dodge the majority of oncoming missiles and ground fire.  When firing back, Air Combat's targeting system is also bit wonky.  Red arrows jump and flash around the screen semi-intelligently from enemy to enemy depending on which way the helicopter is pointing, but there is really no direct control over selecting targets.  Just hold the A button down to spew endless machinegun fire, or drop finite missiles and napalm reserves with the X and Y buttons.  Targets of opportunity always crowd the screen, and there's rarely a shortage of ammunition, so it's hard to knock Air Combat for not feigning the on-screen action. But the control simply isn't tight enough to keep up with the action in most cases, which leads to many unwarranted and frustrating deaths along the 20-mission path.  N64 or GameCube screenshot? You decide. The big ~improvements~ made by 3DO in this quick cash-in port include four new levels added to the 16 found in the N64 version, a new front-end presentation, and a few minor visual upgrades.  Otherwise, the game plays very similarly to any of the incarnations before it, and that includes the massive, chunky framerate slowdown during heated battles.  Had the slowdown not occurred in any of the previous versions, then one might assume that the porting process was to blame.  However, this slideshow effect has been a problem ever since the game first debuted three years ago, and it has most certainly not been fixed on the GameCube.  The action and pacing definitely takes a huge hit whenever a group of RPG troops and vehicles congregate on-screen and players return fire with rockets of their own.  It's a very frequent problem that doesn't render the game completely unplayable, but doesn't exactly encourage repeated gameplay, either.      The single-player campaign provides a few hours of flashy and frustrating gameplay from start to end. Players can also get a buddy to help out in the campaign cooperative mode, but the vertically split screen squishes and distorts each player's view a bit, making the battlefield perspective a bit awkward (if not amusing like a funhouse mirror).  There are also four mildly entertaining multiplayer modes that give players a chance to shoot it out in a deathmatch arena, be the first to collect a number of objects, or compete in a simple capture the flag set-up.  They're all limited to two-players and are all just about as fun as the simple, crude helicopter action framework established in the single-player missions.  In other words: they're mildly amusing at first, but very quickly forgotten.   Graphics The N64 was a great system, but we're not looking for a nostalgia trip when booting up our GameCubes.  If we wanted to find rudimentary lighting effects, never-ending patches of repeating textures, low-polygon models, and rickety framerates, then we would have fired up the old cartridge-based system instead.  Sadly, that's exactly what 3DO is offering in its latest GameCube package, and it doesn't come close to doing the system justice.  Everything relating to Air Combat's visuals can be described as basic, repetitive, and just plain ugly at times.  Texture seams and glitches are found far too often, and environments are very small and empty feeling.  While we're certainly glad that 3DO is sticking with the green and tan motif and staying true to the simplicity of the classic toys, the series definitely needs a visual overhaul, and Air Combat is a showcase for it.  Sound In keeping with its shoddy technical framework, Air Combat's audio suffers from horrible sound effects that are downright comical at times.  Again, everything revolves around the fact that this game is based on toys and the kinds of sounds little plastic machines of war might produce.  But when missiles and napalm go ~boom~ and then we next hear a falling enemy helicopter give off a zany cartoon spinning sound, it's hard to decide whether or not to take the game seriously.  The game is mixed with all sorts of real-world sounds clashing with silly toy noises, and none of them are very exciting.  Again, repetitive and bland are the key words here, and they're not words that we enjoy using.Just like the Oracle, we hate giving good people bad news, and the folks at 3DO are good people.  Sadly, we have bad news for them: Army Men: Air Combat ~The Elite Missions~ is a sub-par GameCube title.  It was decent when we first checked it out nearly three years ago, but finding it now relatively unchanged and on store shelves with a GameCube logo affixed is a true shame.  Given that production costs must have set the company back a quick five bucks or so, the game is sure to rake some cash from unsuspecting shoppers.  But for the more intelligent gamers in the crowd, realize that this game is very simple, very raw, very ugly, and ultimately not a lot of fun.  It's a shameless attempt to quickly cash-in on a new market -- nothing more.  There are much better games to spend your time and money on, and this re-hashed N64 title is not one of them.", "date": "Apr 22, 2003"}
