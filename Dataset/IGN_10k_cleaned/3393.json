Like all new fads, development studios quickly went to the drawing board and attempted to construct similar technologies in their own games.  Even the trend-setting Nintendo of Japan finally jumped onto the cel-shading bandwagon with its highly anticipated Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.  You know a trend is worthwhile if Nintendo of all companies implements it.  So, we're now seeing cel-shaded racers, cel-shaded shooters, and -- thanks to publisher Majesco -- cel-shaded boxers.  The name of the game is Black & Bruised, and it's officially arrived for the GameCube and PlayStation 2.  IGN regularly checked-in on the title's progress during the past year, each time being impressed by its flashy cartoon appeal and fast-paced fighting action.  We did have a few fundamental gameplay concerns at the time, and so we cracked open this latest shipment of reviewable code with high hopes.  Read on to see if developer Digital Fiction was able to hook us with its flurry of cel-shaded jabs.  The Facts:   14 immediately selectable boxers and five unlockable characters, each with its own ringside location and theme music  Boxers rated in four categories: strength, speed, reach, and movement  Five different gameplay modes, including 1/2P Fight, Tournament, Boxer's Life, Survival, and Training   Cheat menu for unlocking even more wacky secrets  For one or two players  Presentation From the beginning, Majesco knew that Black & Bruised would be stylish at its core.  It's been said time and again that the cel-shaded look and overabundance of personality found in B&B was influenced from the classic Nintendo Punch-Out! franchise of years past.  And to a large degree, Digital Fiction succeeded in infusing the title with exactly that: personality, flair, and top-notch presentation.  It's not hard to visualize the concept art that must have been adoringly sketched and later rubber-stamped by the production team in designing the game.  Each character practically leaps from the canvas and comes to life with distinctive names, personalities, costumes, fighting styles, background music, and voiceovers.  Take, for instance, our man known as ~El Luchador.~  This masked Spanish fly appears to be the lovechild of a tiger and a melon.  With his lime green pointy stripes, he taunts his opponents via witty quips of burritos and ass-whippings.  Or you've got ~Micky McFist,~ the scrappy Irish brawler with the cloverleaf tattoo on his chest -- something of an orange-haired version of Brad Pitt from Snatch.  Others such as ~Jumping Janet~ or ~Tiny,~ the obviously largest boxer in the game, leave more to be desired.  Still, it's a motley crew that players should have no problems finding a favorite fighter among for whooping the tar out of the rest.  As the rest of the package goes, the menus are all clean, bright, and full of life and sound.  Digital Fiction even added a few subtle touches that most wouldn't notice; for instance, every time you select a player, his or her facial expression randomly changes.  Perhaps one of the best presentation touches is the good use of voiceovers in the menus, cutscenes, and even the practice tutorial.  It's nothing big, sure, but such little touches go a long way to keeping things subliminally stimulating, and such little touches work nicely here in Black & Bruised.  Gameplay As we've experienced in the past with this title, slipping on the gloves and tossing around our cel-shaded dukes in Black & Bruised is a bout of mixed results.  The action is fast, the variety of punches and animations are all well done, but the fundamental arcade boxing engine itself is still nothing close to the excellence achieved by even Punch-Out! so many years before.  Basic moves still function much the same as we've experienced in the past. The button configuration is still fairly similar, with B and A buttons hucking your left and right punches respectively.  The R button can be used as an uppercut modifier, and L will put up your defenses.  One thing that we're thrilled to see is the new combo system that's been seriously tweaked since our last go around in July of 2002.  Instead of simply mashing two buttons simultaneously, a string of buttons must now be entered in succession.  For example, a double right hook, left jab, and right uppercut chain combo could be done with X, X, R+Y, R+A.  These combos do require some practice and memorization, as they're intuitive yet cryptic to discover.  Thankfully, the combo practice mode is well done and should have you tossing flurries of fists in a wildly exaggerated manner in no time.  As for how effective these combos are, that's another matter entirely.  Some connect on the early punches only to miss in the latter blows; this is especially true during the longer chains.  Sadly, combos are still your best strategy for victory, as each match typically results in frantic punching through intense button mashing.  Most characters are so agile and quick that you'll instantly feel an urgency to land more punches than your opponent and faster.  There's really little way to react to the oncoming attacks in any fashion that encourages player finesse.  Typical strategy involves blocking a flurry and then retaliating with a flurry of your own.  But often the player with the quickest thumb wins out in the end.  Thus, the action is frantic to be sure, but it lacks the depth a true boxing game needs to grant you precise control of your fighter and allow you to shuck and jive, read your opponent, and land precision blows.  In keeping with this frenetic arcade/cartoon angle, Digital Fiction included another key gameplay element to help spruce up the gameplay: the power meter.  As players pummel their opponents, a meter of stars builds for every successful punch.  Once it's complete, you can click the Z button to snag the randomized power-up item floating in the lower-center of the screen.  These items rang from simple damage power-ups to speed boosts, extra health, and wacky inverse items that hurt your foes as you build health.  Players can also choose to keep building their meter three times over for an even more powerful item.  As noted by our own Douglass C. Perry, these items add a definite Mario Kart feel to the game, which is a good concept.  But unlike Mario Kart, there's no real skill involved in the timing or usage of such abilities, as you're likely to pump your fists as fast as possible regardless.  This is the single biggest, crippling flaw to the gameplay engine itself: despite the addition of chain combos and power-ups, the entire experience still plays far too shallow and lends itself to the simple mash of the controller.  The frenzied pace seems like a great trait on the surface, but ultimately becomes the biggest drawback to any boxing fun to be found in the title.  If you're looking to extend this meager gameplay fun outside of the standard 1P fight mode, then Digital Fiction has gone to great lengths at add plenty of extra goodies.  For starters, the inclusion of the neat ~Boxer's Life~ mode is a wonderful thing.  Players can select any of the 19 total fighters and venture through a story mode of sorts.  Before each round, an FMV story unfolds that depicts a scenario for the fight.  Players must fight through each match in goofy ways or complete various objectives to proceed.  There are at least six different battles for each character to complete, thus close to 100 specially crafted rounds, complete with FMV story intros and objectives.  This mode should please fans of the game considerably, presuming that one enjoys the boxing action enough to fight through them all.    Graphics To some degree, there's a tiny bit of a graphics sap lurking within us all.  We see something pretty and our eyes light up with wonder.  Black & Bruised is one such visceral pleasure.  It's truly some of the most polished cel-shading we've seen on any console or PC title thus far.  The characters are all bright, clean, and truly look more flat and cartoony than even some of Miyamoto's recent real-time Link renderings.  The subtle shadows and hard edges all blend to create a pseudo-2D style that's refreshing like a good Saturday morning episode of G.I.Joe.  The animations are also very well done, with exaggerated punches connecting with cranked necks all throughout the matches.  B&B's engine is fairly robust as well, as the game never once skips below it's near 60 frames-per-second draw rate.  Additionally, the few texture details to be found such as tattoos and facial damage are all vibrant and crisp.  For what it sets out to accomplish, there's very little to flaw the title visually in any department, except for perhaps the slight lack of details and activity lurking behind the various rings.  For those who enjoy the overly simplified fighting gameplay, they've got themselves a real treat to savor on the screen in the form of cel-shaded boxing beauty.   Sound Easily the biggest bruise on the body of this contender, the audio suffers in every way but one: quantity.  The game definitely packs in tons of spoken lines from all of the different characters, and you'll hear something fresh in just about every gameplay mode you venture through.  If quantity were all that mattered, this game would fare well.  Sadly, quantity is just about all it has going for it.  Sure, the voice acting is good, but this is a boxing game at its core.  When you nail a sucker in the jaw with a sharp left hook, his crusty face had better explode with a resonating ~wallop~ that lets you know that you just connected and hard.  But there's none of that to be found in Black & Bruised.  Instead, you'll think you've spent an entire evening in the kitchen slapping cupboards shut for hours.  The sound effects are nothing like the meat-slapping sounds of agony that a boxing game typically prides itself upon, and as a result, the onscreen action becomes slightly less gratifying.  And let's not even get started on the music: horrible synthesizer demo tracks that loop every five seconds (literally) during the fights.  As Fran would say, ~Whoopsee-daisy!~   For GameCube fans, the audio flaws only compound themselves due to the ever-nagging smaller disc size and resulting audio compression.  It's nothing out of the norm for the system, but regardless, most voices and even some effects will suffer from a touch of tinny fuzz lurking beneath.  Do us a favor and keep the volume at safe levels on your home stereo so as not to send any nearby canine creatures into trauma.If we at IGN rated games on personality, presentation, and visuals alone, Majesco's Black & Bruised would come highly recommended.  It's a real treat to watch the action dance around on-screen, almost like staring for hours at one of those stereograms at the local mall poster shop.  As fighters trade blows and the camera rotates smoothly around the action, it's pretty amazing to see how detailed and truly cartoon-like the cel-shaded characters appear.  But when you stop the drooling and start focusing on the gameplay the disc has to offer, suddenly the infatuation becomes nothing more than a superficial love affair.For fighting and boxing fans hoping for an artistic rendition of Rocky, it was not meant to be with Black and Bruised.  The gameplay is strongly rooted in quick and shallow action, and won't hook you beyond the various story and tournament modes that were wisely included.  Definitely give it a look if you're helplessly attracted to the style and personality the title spouts; perhaps for a great weekend rental.  Purchase with caution, however, as there's little chance that you'll find yourself jumping back into the ring once your love affair ends.", "date": "Jan 27, 2003"}
