It's a unique and exclusive place to work, one that has captured the interest of millions outside its borders through films and TV shows like The Devil Wears Prada, Ugly Betty and America's Next Top Model. And it's intriguing, too, for how demanding it is. Designing on a deadline, working to please a boss or outshine a rival, winning praise and affirmation through positive reviews in fashion magazines  you can see how a video game capitalizing on the fashion culture could have a lot of potential for engaging play. Imagine: Fashion Designer attempts to be such a game, a title focused on the creative and enjoyable aspects of working in the fashion world. Unfortunately, though, it quickly gets brought down  by what is, likely, an all-too-accurate emulation of the real world's actual fashion industry.   Your clients are never satisfied. Offering you their business and giving you an order for an outfit design, or a fresh hairstyle, or a new kind of necklace, you inevitably fail, again and again, to deliver exactly what they want. Too demanding and too precise are their requests, as it becomes a game of guesswork and luck to eventually arrive at the one, single, perfect combination of colors and style that they're requesting  and, even if you succeed, your reward is nothing more than another outlandish order.   That's how Fashion Designer plays out, as you're placed in the role of a young, up-and-coming design studio owner hoping to make a name for yourself in the high stakes world of fashion. But any excitement that description might encourage in the young, fashion-focused women that this release is targeting is quickly pushed aside and replaced with frustration, as the too-demanding clients' orders get to be much too much to handle as early as five minutes into the game. There's an order for a shirt design with white straps and a printed pattern. Simple enough. But no matter how many different white-strapped, printed-patterned designs you create and present, nothing is satisfactory to the game. Everything is rejected, as the message ~That's not what the client wants~ is endlessly repeated.   Design dresses, necklaces, hairstyles and more. (If you can last that long.)  It's a complete potential killer, and even if you manage to make it through, the rest of the experience will likely be spoiled by the event  and by the knowledge that it's not an isolated one.   It wouldn't be so bad of a concept  being a studio owner, filling orders for a client  if you were offered more freedom. But Fashion Designer's idea of ~designing~ anything seems to simply be scrolling through lists of pre-existing options. Whereas a fashion designing game on a touch screen system could imply the idea of freeform fabric cutting and unrestricted application of colors and patterns, none of that potential is realized here. You instead simply select from a handful of shirts, pants, hairstyles or what have you from an uninspiring menu system.   What's more, the navigation of said system is also a chore, and sometimes even experiences glitches along the way. When you're received a design request from a client, for example, you often aren't allowed to complete a new design to fill the request on the spot. You have to exit the story mode, go back to the main menu, enter the free design mode, complete a design you think will work to fill the order, navigate back through all the previous menus again and present your efforts.    At which point, of course, it will likely be rejected and you'll have to do it all over again.    The glitches occur when you try to clean out your existing collection by deleting some items. If there are designs and styles that failed to please your client, no sense keeping them around  but if you try to delete too many designs at once, you may find that the game chooses to ~undelete~ some of its own default designs and, further, ends up losing one or more of the ones you wanted to keep along the way.All of these issues being in place, Imagine: Fashion Designer just ends up being a frustrating, unfocused and ultimately soulless product. It's possible to stick with it and power through all of the glitches and garbage assignments to finally get to more of heart of the game, where some young women would enjoy the make-up mode, photo shoots and ~walk the catwalk~ mini-games. But those small designs aren't nearly compelling enough to redeem the greater disappointment of the whole, so you're better off avoiding this scene altogether.", "date": "Nov 21, 2007"}
