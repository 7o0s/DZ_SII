Every time I pop the cartridge in for a few rounds, a new gameplay issue arises that could have and should have been addressed when the title was developed. I really wanted to love Fortress, since the game does have a lot of very clever ideas. But in the end, it seems very unfinished, never reaching the point that it needs to be a ~decent~ Game Boy Advance title. Features Four different levels Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Advance  At a quick glance, it's easy to dismiss Fortress as a Tetris clone. But it's not -- in fact, the only similarities to the game are the pieces that fall from the sky. It's not a game of creating horizontal lines, and it's definitely not about removing blocks from play. The whole point of Fortress is to stack these falling Tetris pieces on top of each other in such a way that they form rectangles out of the individual blocks -- after a Tetris piece fills a gap and completes a 6x6 or higher rectangle or square, the rectangle or square actually turns into a tangible wall that will protect your fortress from the oncoming assault.  See, you're up against another opponent doing the exact same thing as you. And the faster and more strategic you are placing each falling piece, the more points you can score -- and after a certain amount of points have been earned, an offensive or defensive unit will fall in the place of the Tetris piece. If you plant these power-ups on a safe location, they'll turn into an active unit that will either fire at the opponent's fortress, or fortify your own fortress by turning dead blocks into fortress walls. Obviously, the more units you have working for you, the more powerful your fortress is, and the more likely you'll collapse the opponent's wall to make it more difficult for him to work as fast as he has been. The game ends when the first player reaches a designated point level.  The problems of Fortress are many, and obvious. Just by the description alone most people won't get the nuances, since it's incredibly unclear what's actually needed to be done the first time playing the game. What falling icon does what? How does one summon monsters? Why is there a pterodactyl attacking my fortress? How did I get blocks that actually ruin my walls? How did the computer opponent get so many cannons? How do I get a Defensive Bonus? There are way too many questions that need to be answered in this game, which is why this title absolutely, positively needed a Tutorial Mode option put in place. How are gamers going to realize that a 8 block high by 3 block wide formation will turn into a Wizard's Tower, necessary in summoning the giant creatures in each of the four lands? It's in the manual, sure, but written in such a way that the designers expect you to know the task at hand. And besides, how many folks do you know that actually read through that little booklet right from the get go? I sure as heck don't, and it's not good design practice to confuse gamers into resorting to grab the little pamphlet...especially in the Game Boy market, where most players only bring the cartridge with them. A tutorial mode as well as a practice mode would have done wonders for the presentation of Fortress. Majesco has performed a decent job with the graphics of the game, though, using multiscrolling backgrounds to good effect, and pulling off an engine that has a lot of sprites flying across the screen. But, even this engine has trouble keeping up with the action -- as both fortresses get larger and stronger, the game gets slower and controls get very sluggish. At times, my thumb was aching by mashing down on the D-pad, trying to get the pieces to move faster across the screen.  There's also not a whole lot of gaming options. For folks without a second copy of the cartridge, you're only offered a single player option of three ~different~ styles of gameplay, but all those options are essentially the same thing: Battle, Blitz, and Tournament modes. And for some reason, you have to refer to the manual to figure out which each of these actually are. The game is a one-trick pony in this respect, and it would have benefited greatly from challenge modes that utilize the game's puzzle engine. Sure, there are four different locations in Fortress, but the changes are merely cosmetic -- instead of lobbing rocks in prehistoric times, it's cannonballs in the pirate and medieval worlds, or laser bolts in space. They don't offer anything different, other than brand new graphic characters and tiles. Once the computer AI of Fortress has been learned, the game loses its appeal and challenge...and then it's off to the bottom of the GBA bin.  The replay value comes from the link cable implementation, and here Majesco gets kudos. But only partial points, since this game would have been infinitely better as a three or four player game. Battling against a second player is great, but having additional players and choosing which opponent to lob all the firepower at would have added a lot to the game design...but the game engine has a difficult time keeping up with two fortresses, so it's a strictly two player only affair. Maybe for Fortress II... Fortress. is a good first attempt at an original Game Boy Advance title for Majesco, but the game is missing so many gameplay necessities that it's difficult to recommend the game beyond the  ~borrow from a friend~ level. It feels very unfinished, especially without an extremely necessary tutorial mode -- it's a bit arrogant to expect gamers to figure out the game on their first try. Thrusting them into battle on their virgin battle is not only extremely unfair, it will also scare them away from what little charm this game actually has buried inside. I'll definitely look forward to a sequel if it's planned, since the overall game idea is a great one...the implementation is what's lackluster in Fortress.", "date": "Aug 20, 2001"}
