Though Konami's own Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars was obviously in development before the team realized just how great Advance Wars would turn out, Konami has the misfortune of riding Nintendo's coattails with its own futuristic turn-based strategy design.  And even with the game following a lot of the same formula as Advance Wars, Konami's strategy design for its ZOE property isn't nearly as intuitive or clean in its interface, and the heavy focus on storytelling might make a lot of people lose interest. Features More than a dozen missions Battery save (three save slots, one instant save slot) Only for Game Boy Advance Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars is a completely independent game from Zone of the Enders released on the PlayStation 2 last year. The two games' only connection is that it takes place within the same universe and timespan: 2173, a future where colonies have sprouted on and around neighboring planets, and giant mechanized robots are pretty much a normal occurance around the solar system. The Game Boy Advance game follows Cage, an inhabitant on the migration ship Bonaparte III...after the ship bites the big one, Cage befriends a resistance group and joins forces with them, righting wrong and all that good stuff.  The gameplay itself is a huge departure from the PlayStation game, as the game no longer simulates the action from within the cockpit of a giant mechanized robot. Instead, players take command of the whole army of tanks and fighters in an overhead map, taking turns back and forth between your fleet and the opponents. Players will have to keep an eye on the abilities and strengths/weaknesses of each of the vehicles in their group, and use the money earned in battle to upgrade and advance their abilities after a fight. Locations on the map also affect how well/poorly your units will handle themselves during battle.  The strategy can get almost as deep as Advance Wars, but because the game forces the gamer to jump right in and learn the stuff and somewhat clumsy interface for himself, it'll take a few hours just to figure out all the nuances.  ZOE: The Fist of Mars' main hook is its battle engine -- during any attack or defensive phase, players will try to outmaneuver the defending/attacking craft within the IAS (interactive action sequence) interface. In the attack phase, it's all about hitting the fire button when the crosshairs are positioned on the enemy. In the defensive mode, the challenge is to avoid getting a target lock by swerving up, down, left, and right. Each unit has its own strength and weakness during this phase...a powerful ship, for example, will have tighter control over the crosshair, a larger targetting area, and a longer time to attack. A craft with higher defense will have quicker maneuvering to avoid the target lock. While this all sounds like a cool implementation, it does tend to get tedious, and it drags out the time it takes to finish a mission...attacks per vehicle can last more than 15 seconds each. And, though you can turn off either the offensive or defensive (or both) modes at any time, the attack/defensive phases are pre-calculated based on the statistics for each of the vehicles...so the chances of hitting or missing during these phases are no longer in your control.  It's a Catch-22, unfortunately...but it's best to leave the combat sequences on and deal with the extremely long mission times. Luckily ZOE has an instant save slot that can be used at any time during a mission.  The biggest issue with ZOE: The Fist of Mars is its oversaturation of plot. For the kind of game this is, there is absolutely way too much conversation between each of the characters. The story unfolds in a bland, uninformative ~talking head~ interface...it's just two different faces on top of a background representing the location of these characters. It's very difficult to follow exactly what's happening in the plot simply because it's not exactly clear who's interacting with whom. And there's just so much text to read before, during, and after the missions that it's extremely tempting to just hit the A button really fast to get to the meat of the game...but then, you'd be missing out on key details happening in the storyline. Bummer. Unfortunately for Konami, its Zone of the Enders' design makes for a somewhat dull Game Boy Advance experience. The strategy elements are plentiful, but the game's design is nowhere as deep as Advance Wars...and several missions can be completed simply by an all-out frontal assault. Its gameplay may be similar in concept to the outstanding Advance Wars, but ZOE: The Fist of Mars is saturated with way too much story and battle sequences that drag out the missions far too long. The game's not terrible by any means...it just has a poorly balanced presentation with too much fluff surrounding the game's substance.", "date": "Mar 5, 2002"}
