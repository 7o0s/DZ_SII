{"name": "Minority Report", "name_review": "Minority Report", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/20/minority-report-3", "text": "Earlier this year, Steven Spielberg released a smashing sci-fi movie featuring Tom Cruise by the name of Minority Report. Centered on a future where an organization known as Precrime employs three psychic women to predict violent acts before they happen, there hasn't been a single murder committed in the last five years. When one of Precrime's own named John Anderton is convicted of committing such a crime however, the higher-ups get shaken and the quest for justice begins.   Positive of his innocence, Anderton ends up running for his life like every other convicted pre-criminal, and ends up getting chased by his colleagues and former buddies at Precrime.  Promising videogame premise as that may be, Treyarch's own version of Minority Report fails to capture the marvel of its movie counterpart. And even worse, doesn't offer any of the thrills from that picture in this failed movie-turned-video-game endeavor.   Gameplay  Without the rights to Tom Cruise's likeness, Treyarch made a unique choice regarding the identity of the game's hero John Anderton. A bit more reminiscent of Splinter Cell's Sam Fischer than the spry Mr. Cruise, the older, white-haired hero in this particular adventure bears no resemblance to the movie star whatsoever. In other areas however, the game borrows many specific elements from the movie while still weaving its own tale. It succeeds for the most part in telling a slightly different version of the story found in the movie, but ends up falling short of becoming anything truly memorable. If you've never seen or heard of the picture before, chances are that you'll be completely lost, since the game never offs a single explanation as to who the psychic pre-cogs are or what Precrime is really all about. This is nothing earth-shattering mind you, just a polite warning for those of you looking for a more detailed interpretation of the motion picture.   To its credit, Minority Report boasts well over 40 levels, but in all honesty, you can finish them all in under ten hours. Taking the tag line ~everybody runs~ to close to heart, the game offers up far too many levels that allow Anderton to simply run past his opponents and into the exit section. But then again, that could end up being a good thing since the whole premise of the game is that John is out to find answers to his accusation --not fight his buddies. But let's face it folks, it's not. This is an action-based videogame, and when a piece of software comes along with that description, you want to hurt people. What we get instead are areas that can be slid through, jumped, and beaten in less than a minute; no joke.    Luckily, there are sections in the latter part of the game that actually force you to fight your way out of hairy situations. Which would be great, if those particular stages weren't as confined and populated with objects as they are. Cluttered beyond belief, it's hard to kick anybody's ass effectively when you're right in the middle of them all with little breathing room. It's as though the designers went to the extreme in both possible respects. Offering super wide-open sections and short exits in the running levels and tight quarters with little area to move in the combat stages. Poor engineering.   Fortunately the fighting engine is pretty good (based on the same one that powered the excellent summer action hit Spider-Man), and provides the player with a large variety of available combos and techniques. You can jump; use a strong or quick attack, block, or even grab baddies and throw them all over the place. While combos themselves consist of the three-button variety with a number of new ones that can be bought on the black market with money you collect from each level.   Rarely will you ever fight one man (or robot or mechanical spider) at a time. Instead you'll often wind up surrounded and attacked from all possible sides. The one aspect above all else that makes the battles truly difficult (though getting off a shot from long range doesn't make much of a difference either), this challenge would have made us a lot happier if there wasn't a simple technique that guarantees victory almost 100% of the time. To do it, simply squeeze the L1 trigger as you run and the main character will slide. What this attack does is knock down several adversaries at a time, and stun them simultaneously. In the meantime, you're free to repeat the move all over again as they stumble their way back up. You can in all seriousness win your way through the majority of your battles with this simple inexpensive technique. Want proof of improper balancing? There you go!   Similarly, Minority Report doesn't exactly offer a huge variety of firearms or ammunition, but there's enough in the arsenal (about a half-dozen or so) to keep things interesting. Guns are generally difficult to come by though, so conserving shots is a necessary step to their longevity. If you're curious as to what kind of weapons you can pick up, the film inspires them all. An energy-based wave gun, a rocket launcher, and even a machine pistol are readily available by which to dispense your pursuers. Switching between them is easy via the D-Pad cycle, and aiming is as simple as holding down the R1 trigger. You can change targets by pressing the right analog stick, but it's not as efficient or responsive as it should be in that regard. One the whole however, the majority of the weapons are easy to use and very effective, and are a welcome change of pace from the kicking and punching.    Oh and remember when we said how easy it was to beat your adversaries with the slide tackle? Believe it or not, there's an even easier way to dispense of those troublesome meddlers. Grab a stunned opponent (or slide tackle and grab a fallen opponent) and throw them off a rooftop or flight of stairs. This is instant death move and clears the screen of that foe immediately. Of course, this maneuver goes against the entire premise of Minority Report, but apparently that didn't matter. For a game that centers on a guy who's trying to prove that he isn't a murderer, there sure is a lot of killing going on. To make it even more immoral, think about the Precrime officers themselves. With the exception of a single, potential turncoat, no one in the organization is doing anything wrong -- they're simply doing their job. But here you are tossing people off roofs like they are useless, evil beings. You kill often and indiscriminately without penalty or repercussion, that it almost appears as though this was originally intended to be a different game entirely before suddenly grabbing the Minority Report license.   As for the AI, it's decent but troubling. In general, enemies will surround you and those with guns keep their distance to fire before you can reach him. Usually these foes don't stand around waiting on you either; they move to meet your character head-on. Strangely enough, there are many instances where you'll run past an opponent and cause them to turn their back to you and pretend to be on guard duty. What's going on here? What's even more bothersome is the sudden ruthless nature of Precrime itself. Its officers are constantly shooting their own men in the back, and falling over each other like drunken idiots. There's one boss-battle in particular that sees a hover copters mowing down several allies just to get at poor Mister Anderton.   One interesting, but poorly implemented idea is the black market. By finding cash hidden throughout each level you can purchase health boosts, weapons, fighting combos, and even temporary power-ups. But rather than having a true black market integrated into gameplay, where you perhaps have to find people who can sell you stuff in the back of alleys, you just have to pause the game and purchase an item instantly from the intermission screen. Need some armor?  Pause the game at any time and there it is! Not exactly a massive deal since this isn't meant to be revolutionary action title, there still could have been a better way to handle the store system. It's too quick and easy. But then again, that sums up a lot of the problems in Minority Report right there.   Graphics  Treyarch did a pretty good job with lighting and special effects in this engine's previous owner Spider-Man, and follows suit with Minority Report. Apparently taken straight from the film, the picture-warping, light-sourced artillery is actually pretty stunning.  The problem is that the rest of the game isn't quite as attractive. The textures are blotchy, there are plenty of spots where the game slows down, and there's quite a bit of noticeable clipping. In fact, the spectacular effects make the rest of the game look even more inferior. The two just don't match.   One visual aspect that's been touted time and again is the rag doll body effect. If this is some up and coming trend, let's stop it now -- It looks terrible. Bodies take on the literally consistency of a multi-jointed marionette (as in a thing without proper weight or a skeletal structure). Defeated enemies (and even Anderton when he's hit) fall back with legs flopping as if kneecaps were no longer part of the human anatomy, arms bending awkwardly, and the bodies landing like a pile of dirty laundry. Finding an instance where this looks at all natural is a feat in itself, and should remain a one-time gig that hopefully won't be emulated anytime soon.   Sound  The audio like the rest of the game is hit and miss. Clancy Brown does a fine job stepping in for Tom Cruise and offers a much more hard-nosed smack-you-in-the-face agent Anderton than Jerry Maguire. He's the strongest voice talent in the game by far, with the rest of the cast sounding like the same talent found in every other action game on the market.   Effects and the score are very minimal. In fact, you'll have to wonder if any budget at all was spent in this department, as it's so sparse. It would have been great to hear some music kick in during the intense fight scenes, instead of the calm and quiet atmosphere we wind up with. The best sound in the whole game are the unabashedly cheesy screams that enemies make when thrown off a building or to a lower level, and are often quite funny. ~I'm faaaaaalling!~Minority Report is a great movie and definitely a license that could have become a fantastic game. Perhaps the first mistake was trying to find a balance between the film and doing something new. Treyarch should probably have decided to either do a near-direct translation of the picture or a wholly different concept all together. Instead, they did a bit of this and a bit of that, and the results are poor plot points and lousy stage design. A mixed-bag, and not worth your hard-earned cash, Minority Report is certainly qualified as a weekend rental, but shouldn't find itself in your collection any time soon.", "date": "Nov 20, 2002"}
