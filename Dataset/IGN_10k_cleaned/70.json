When it was announced that Metal Gear Solid was coming to the cell phone, I was concerned that it would be a port of a previous adventure that may not make proper use of the hardware. My worries were put at ease, though, as this isn't your average port. Rather, it's a new adventure designed from the ground up with the cell phone in mind, and the final product manages to do justice to the venerable series.  Taking place between the original Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid 2, players find Snake infiltrating a new facility in the hopes of putting a stop to Revolver Ocelot's Metal Gear black market operation. This is a true MGS experience, and though its story may not be as deep or drawn out as console versions, it's still filled with intrigue, drama and action. What counts more is that the core Metal Gear experience is present: sneaking, shooting, and challenging exciting villains. Metal Gear Solid Mobile is dressed to impress, as it's rendered in full 3D, making for a good-looking game by mobile standards. It's presented using the same camera view that Metal Gear is known for. The camera even goes so far as to allow players to peek around corners to see any dangers, just like it's console counterparts, but the video gets a little choppy as the camera pans to peek. It doesn't suffer from severe slowdown, but it is a noticeable issue throughout the game. Aside from that, it ran fairly well on the LG VX9400 that we were testing it on.  The controls are very familiar, with the d-pad used for movement and the select button for various actions. As they have been remapped for the mobile platform, the controls do come with a learning curve. They may seem a bit unresponsive when thrown in the middle of a firefight for the first time, but as MGS has always been about covert ops, it usually best to sneak about and eliminate your foes discreetly anyway. Once you get the feel for the controls, the layout feels rather smart, as it offers some context sensitive features, allowing the same button to be used for shooting, crawling into ducts or opening lockers. However, during combat, we noticed that hand to hand combat was clunky and slow to respond.  During a close quarter fracas, you'll find that when you need to quickly adjust your positioning or close the distance to your foe, it's a slow and uneven process. On the bright side, this issue is something that occurs only during frantic fisticuffs -- once you get ranged weapons, you can take out baddies from a safe distance, with a first person mode to allow for a bit more precision. As in any MGS title, discretion is the key and you're encouraged to avoid violent encounters, but once you get some heavier armaments, you can always run headlong into a fight and be ready to come out on top.  The camouflage system from Metal Gear Solid 3 has been integrated into the game, but in a unique and interesting way. Using the camo device, you can take color samples from in-game environments, which will change the color of your sneaking suit, allowing you to blend in to the background and avoid notice from various baddies. The thing that makes this system so fascinating is that you can switch over to your phones camera (should your hardware have one) and take pictures of things in the real world and use those as color samples. The fact that you don't need a camera on your handset really makes things work as it doesn't hinder the game play one bit, bringing a slick element that's specific to mobile.Metal Gear Solid Mobile is a great example of how to correctly bring a beloved franchise to a platform as modest as a cell phone. Though there were a few control and video issues, the core gameplay is more or less the same, offering up some good, familiar fun on a smaller scale. Im not too sure how appealing this game would be to casual audiences unfamiliar with MGS world, but its certainly a decent entry point. However, this is certainly something that will appeal to long time fans of the series, as it captures the spirit of Solid Snake while providing the core gameplay we all know and love, giving us a brief interlude before the release of Metal Gear Solid 4.", "date": "Mar 24, 2008"}
