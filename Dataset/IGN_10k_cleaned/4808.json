Sure, there are plenty of RTS-type games and more than enough games set in the Second World War; what sets Soldiers apart is its unique synthesis of existing games. On the surface, the game looks surprisingly like (although slightly better than) the recent World War II themed RTS games. Add to that a healthy dose of Commandos's puzzle elements and fight-against-outrageous-odds setup and a jigger of action combat in the style Ikari Warrior or the Atari classic Combat and you've got a game that seems very familiar yet is unlike anything else already on the market.  The practical upside to this kind of hodgepodge is that you get the best ideas from several different types of games. The potential pitfall is that you'll have some rough edges where the parts don't quite connect. And that's the case with Soldiers. I tend to put it in the same category as another genre-blender, Hitman. Both titles are very refreshing in terms of offering something really new and original but both also suffer a bit when the different types of gameplay clash.  On the whole, though, Soldiers is a very fun game that rewards patient, thoughtful play. You'll lead a small team of soldiers or the odd vehicle or two through a variety of engagements set in the Eastern or Western Fronts of the War in Europe. The four campaigns, one each for Russia, Germany, the UK and the US, come with four or five missions each and there are a handful of standalone missions as well. Though the missions are generally of the ~kill everything~ variety, the large town assaults and open field firefights are balanced by a few missions that call for stealthy infiltration or clever trap-setting.   You can issue orders in the traditional RTS way but the game's at its best when you take direct control of your units. The arrow keys steer you around while the mouse handles aiming and firing. Not surprisingly, this works best with the vehicles where the four inputs (up, down, left and right) better simulate the driving controls. Using an eight-way run scheme while on foot is much less satisfying. The tanks, in particular are a (literal) blast, allowing you to smash your way through nearly any obstacle. Naturally, since the other side also has tanks, some complications are bound to arise.  Tanks and the rest of the vehicles are complicated enough, I suppose. You'll have a limited supply of ammunition and even fuel, so you'll need to proceed carefully. Too much driving back and forth across the field and you'll find that you've run out of gas, making your Panzer nothing more than a very expensive, fascist paperweight. Luckily, you can send your tank crew out to retrieve gas (or ammo) from other vehicles. Managing this process seems like busy work, especially when compared to lobbing 75mm shells back and forth across a crowded town square. This type of management, and the repairs that your crew are often required to make, are hard to carry out under fire so the tank commanders who plan ahead will have a large edge over those that don't. The ultimate test of a commander is in taking out an enemy tank, then sending some troops over to repair and crew it.  I mentioned the title's similarity to Commandos, and I also have to mention that this is one of those save-it-every-minute type games. Though you get better at managing the game's assets, solutions to most of the gameplay challenges will rely on trial and error solutions. Finding just the right approach and prioritizing your targets appropriately are the foundations of success but the enemy's responses to your moves will likely take similar setups off in wildly different directions. Though we noticed some tendencies during certain missions, the enemy AI was able to change its own plans to suit our improvisations on the battlefield.  But I can't pretend that it's all good. There are definitely some pathfinding problems in the game and a few of them are downright obnoxious. For one thing, units in a group tend to maintain the same relative position. So if you have a fairly dispersed group, they'll tend to stay dispersed as they move. This can make putting a group of units behind a small obstacle more work than it should be. Similarly your own vehicles don't seem to have any problem running over things they shouldn't. I've lost vehicles and fuel barrels because my own tanks ran them over. It doesn't happen often but when it does you'll be very angry.      I'm also at a loss to explain the lack of cues when your vehicles are being attacked. Since you have to babysit them to a certain extent, you'd assume the game would throw you a warning or two when a unit you're not controlling is attacked. A few times throughout the campaigns I left one unit in a relatively safe position, went off to direct some other attacks only to come back and find my original unit had been completely wiped out without ever once calling for my help.  The mission triggers and goals could be a bit clearer as well. Knowing that you have to clear out an enemy town is fine but sometimes you'll be notified that you've won while you still have enemies left to fight. In other cases, enemy tanks will come rolling in at the very last minute. Imagine my last tank, completely out of gas with a busted tread and a single living crew member. I'm frantically lobbing the last of my shells at a nearby building, hoping to knock out the final sniper. An enemy tank appears on the edge of the map and starts rolling towards my position. As long as I can take out that sniper, I'm golden and can claim a success even with the enemy tank rolling in behind me. I'm grateful, sure, but I can't help feel a little cheated.  Have you ever noticed how in some 3D games you can really tell they're in 3D? Like the designers go out of their way to emphasize it? Where things like blocky models and flat colors tend to increase your awareness of the 3D-ness of a given game, Soldiers takes the opposite approach, laying complex but subtle textures over relatively complex models. In all it gives the visual detail and character you'd expect from a 2D game with static backgrounds and lively sprites.   You can freely rotate the camera around the action, getting just the right angle on a given moment. The lack of range for the zoom and tilt is easy to live with, particularly when measured against the game's tendency to take the camera away from you to highlight a specific moment. While this is okay as far as it goes, the fact that the camera doesn't return to your original view is downright exasperating.  The weapons effects are simply fantastic. In fact, you'll find yourself looking for something to blow up not so much because it means one less enemy to confront but simply because things blow up so beautifully in this game. Buildings collapse into piles of rubble, infantry go tumbling through the air and vehicles fragment into numerous parts when attacked. You can really wreak havoc on the environments in this game, either demolishing churches with high explosive cannon fire or simply running down trees in your Tiger tank.  But as good as the graphics are the game has some consistent framerate problems. These range in severity from the mildly irritating to the monitor-punchingly infuriating. It seems to be particularly bad once you get a lot of particles or units on the screen. Strangely it also seems to be really bad during the scripted cutscenes. We also saw some weird foliage shadows on our high-end GeForce cards but, strangely, the problem did not occur on our older systems.  Though not a showstopper, the game's pleasant on the ears. The engine and weapon sounds for the vehicles are totally satisfying and, if it weren't for the fact that voice cues get a bit muddy and stack up on each other, the entire suite of sound effects would get high marks from us. The music is also good and suits the overall character of the game without overpowering the action.  Finally, on the subject of multiplayer, the game really shines when you bring a friend along for some co-op action. Dan and I have had a blast over the last week trying out the various missions. Some work better than others simply because you each get the same assets. (A few missions only give one player a tank, leaving the other player to make their way through on foot.) With a simple toggle, either player can switch ownership of a unit back and forth. That the game doesn't offer a more equitable distribution of initial units can easily be forgiven but the fact that you can't save in multiplayer can't. I like Soldiers a lot. There's so much copycat, brand-driven development these days that playing a quality title that takes some chances is a real treat. There are still some stupid mistakes here -- like the lack of a quick save hotkey or the absence of a restart option when you fail a mission -- but all in all, this is an excellent and challenging title that's not content to reproduce what everyone else has already done.Refinement and innovation are often incompatible. It's obvious that Best Way has a solid grasp of the concepts and features here and they definitely go out of their way to emphasize the parts of the game that are the most rewarding. Here's hoping that further development along these lines will eventually eliminate the few problems that come with this type of originality.", "date": "Jun 29, 2004"}
