In the early '90s, Mario had that spot for Nintendo. Sonic was SEGA's go-to guy. For the TurboGrafx-16, it was a short, angry, exceptionally bald caveman named Bonk.   Bonk's Adventure was the flagship title for the TG-16, released in 1990. It was available a full year before the first Sonic the Hedgehog and the debut of the Super NES system with Super Mario World, but unfortunately couldn't attract enough of any audience in the long run. Most gamers of the time were either still hooked on the 8-bit NES or had chosen the SEGA Genesis as their entry into the 16-bit generation. The coming rivalry was clear -- Nintendo vs. SEGA -- and there wasn't much place for a third wheel.   For those relative few who did adopt Hudson and NEC's Turbo machine, several great gaming gems were available to enjoy. Bonk's Adventure was the biggest, and ultimately became the best-selling piece of software for the system.   It's 2D platforming through a prehistoric world. Bonk can run and jump through these side-scrolling levels, just like Mario, but also does something Nintendo's plumber never did: he uses his head. Bonk can attack enemies with vicious headbutts, made all the more powerful by the colossal size of his cranium. Forward attacks on the ground are the simplest as Bonk just bashes whatever's in front of him. But the headbutt can also be activated in the air, causing the hero to dive-bomb headfirst toward the ground.   Enemies unfortunate enough to be underneath the crashing Cro-Magnon will either get squashed or shaken up by the ensuing earthquake triggered by his impact. The mid-air maneuver isn't just an attack, though. You can flip Bonk in circles with fast button presses, extending the airtime of and distance covered by his jumps. His voracious caveman appetite comes into play, as slabs of meat cause Bonk to de-evolve into more powerful, primal and even invincible forms. His razor-sharp teeth can also be used to scale sheer walls.   Bonk's world is rendered vibrantly, with colorful and expressive graphics that prominently asserted the TurboGrafx-16's power back in 1990. The environments explored range from open Jurassic planes to the inner digestive tract of a T-Rex -- a goofy sense of humor accompanies the hero through his journey.2D platforming was one of the industry's most popular genres through the 8- and 16-bit generations, and Bonk's first outing is one of the classics of the age (inspiring numerous sequels, spin-offs and ports in following years). Those follow-ups you can safely go without -- but the original Bonk's Adventure is firmly recommended as an icon of the 16-bit era's oft-forgotten third place finisher.", "date": "Dec 7, 2006"}
