A sequel to their popular futuristic first-person shooter, RF II was well-received by the Sony community.  Now Red Faction II is coming to Xbox, six months past due.  Can THQ and developer Volition offer enough newness to validate the long wait?  While RF II is a fun FPS with a fantastic multiplayer mode, it fails in just about every way to utilize the power and functionality of Xbox.    Features Eleven single-player levels full of first-person action Fourteen choice weapons to ace your opponents Create and manage your own bots Whopping 60 multiplayer maps! Four-player split-screen multiplayer  Gameplay Taking place in a future where the world is controlled by fascist dictator Chancellor Sopot, the Red Faction is a rag-tag group of enhanced super-soldiers determined to free the world from tyranny.  The twist is, Sopot used nano-technology to create the members of Red Faction, but became fearful they would turn against him and so ordered them killed.    You play as Alias, the demolitions expert in this fast-paced first-person shooter.  The first half of Red Faction II has you hunting down Sopot and the resulting final battle is, well, not even a battle.  The second half of the game involves a nice twist that helps kick the action into high gear and has you fighting for your life on the streets of Earth.    There tend to be two types of first-person shooters in the current age of consoles.  There are the more common twitch shooters where the story means nothing and it's really just about killing Nazis or zombies or zombie Nazis.  Then there are story-driven shooters like Halo, where there's no dearth of action, but the story is another gameplay component that helps make the game compelling.  Red Faction II is somewhere in the middle.  It certainly seems like a game that wants to tell a story, but the scripting and story progression are pretty weak.  And most of the FMV sequences last less than thirty seconds.  The twist midway through the game doesn't have any impact on the game, because there's been nothing to make gamers invest in the characters.  The world environment, the feeling of oppression and rebellion, seems a perfect backdrop for telling an interesting story.  But someone dropped the ball, and in the end that hurts the single-player mode a little bit.  There's an attempt at a story, but it's a hollow one at that.    What RF II does incredibly well is make for an easy pick-up-and play experience.  The controls are about as stripped down and simple as possible for a first-person shooter, with the triggers acting as primary and secondary fire and the face buttons used for weapon select and to toss grenades.  Clicking in on the thumbsticks make Alias crouch and jump and the D-Pad can be used to scroll through grenade selections or turn on night vision (which is needed in only a few parts of the game).    What this does is place the primary focus and reliance on the triggers to fire and the thumbsticks to move you around.  Your focus is on shooting baddies, and the controls allow for that quite easily.  Perhaps coolest is the ability to take out two pistols or submachineguns and fire them simultaneously.  The left trigger represents the gun in your left hand, the right trigger for the gun in your right hand.  You can pitter-patter your shots so that the left pistol fires and is immediately followed by a shot from the pistol in your right hand.  This allows you to have continuous fire even while one of your guns is recoiling.  Plus, it's pretty fun.  Health works similar to Halo.  Given a few seconds away from a firefight, your health will instantly regenerate, with sound effects disturbingly familiar to those heard in Bungie's masterpiece.  Only this health isn't some kind of protective shield, but is your actual life bar.  When one bar is whittled down, you automatically use a med pack to fully heal.  But you can only hold three med packs at any one time.  Still, on medium mode, dying really isn't going to be a problem throughout the majority of the game.  And even if you do die, you'll be kicked back to the last load section.  And there are lots of load sections.  I mean, lots of load sections.      There are moments during RF II where you must take control of vehicles.  You'll man the guns of a chopper, drive a tank through town, walk the streets in massive battle armor, and submerge in a sub.  The controls for each of these is almost identical to control when on foot, so the transition is seamless.  It almost feels like the vehicle modes are just an extension of the run and gun modes, which is exactly how it should be.  Levels in Red Faction II are linear, but there are lots of short offshoots where you can complete side quests.   There are few points in the game where you'll need to question where to go, because there's generally only a single path to follow.  And all offshoots either come to a dead end after you've finished the side quest or rejoin the main path shortly thereafter.  There's nothing wrong with being linear, but in light of many of the FPS' out today, which have a main pathway but plenty of places for exploration and offer lots of different access points, RF II feels a bit limiting, particularly when commanding a vehicle.  The level design itself is pretty good.    Thanks to Volition's Geo-Mod technology, everything in the environment can be dinged, dented, scorched, crumpled, or fragged.  There are numerous walls that can be destroyed to open secrets paths, which generally lead to extra ammo or health.  But you have to be careful where you shoot, because innocent civilians are sprinkled throughout each level.  Kill an innocent and your 'heroic' meter takes a ding.    Your heroic level after the final battle determines whether you receive the good or bad ending.  Unfortunately, it doesn't affect any other aspect of the game.  Perhaps if being heroic meant you had better luck at finding helpful items or that you got a slight power boost, or perhaps even got better assistance from your teammates, it would have added more dynamic gameplay.  As it is, Red Faction II is a bit too straight-forward for its own good.   Enemy AI is a bit troubling to analyze.  Sometimes it's superb.  You'll see guys ducking behind crates, popping out from behind walls, and running when a grenade is thrown.  Other times they will stand still while you unload on them.  Though these moments are more rare, the AI is a bit too inconsistent.  In the end it appears that there are just a few different attack routines assigned to different enemies as opposed to a more advanced reactionary AI that is becoming more prevalent in shooters today.  But it's hard to discount how much fun enemies can be to toy with from time to time.  Shoot an incendiary grenade into a crowd of baddies and listen to them scream, then watch them run around a good minute, flailing their arms because, apparently in their army no one ever taught them the value of ~stop, drop, and roll.~    Any game can overcome problems with linearity and a ~been there, done that~ feel if it's fun.  And that's Red Faction II's saving grace.  The single-player action is a lot of fun.  It's a good engine, a blast to play, but it's not quite up to the standards of the new generation of first-person shooters.  The other nagging issue is that the single player is relatively easy and incredibly short.  I finished it in just under six hours and, without side quests, it could probably be finished even quicker than that.  And it's just not compelling enough to play through multiple times.  That puts a heavy burden on the multiplayer.  And that's where Red Faction II truly shines.  The multiplayer modes are great and just about as good as it gets.  Allowing up to four players on splitscreen, you can also add numerous bots.  Up to six total characters can play in 60 different maps and across over a half dozen game types.    Of course, you get the standard Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch.  RF II also adds Capture the Flag, Bagman and Team Bagman, Arena and Team Arena, and Regime.    Most of the modes aren't really anything new.  Some may have names you don't recognize, but it's pretty much a lot of your typical multiplayer functions.  However, the maps are well-designed overall and offer a huge variety of locations.  Personally, I love The Maze the best, which is literally a giant maze of walls.    Perhaps more impressive than the maps is the ability to create up to five different bots.  Give them names, give them skins, then distribute attribute points and adjust their level of aggressiveness and tendency to camp.  You want one bot who's a sharpshooter with low health?  Done.  You want another who can run in and brawl?  It's yours.  You can then insert any of your created bots into a one, two, three, or four-player multiplayer game.        If you're looking to have some fun with friends in multiplayer (or are a lonely bastard who wants to play against five bots), then Red Faction II was made for you.  The multiplayer modes are solid, the maps are great, and the bot functionality is top notch for what's offered from today's games.  That's all fine and dandy, but there are some problems here in Xboxland.  THQ took half a year to bring RF II to Xbox, and the only real enhancement aside from a few graphical bumps was some extra multiplayer maps?  This game is screaming for Xbox Live.  But the pioneers of Live (THQ published the first Live game) didn't take the game that far.  In fact, the game doesn't even support System Link.  That's a big knock against RF II.  Delayed ports need to utilize the Xbox hardware in some way.  Otherwise, what makes a $50 Xbox version better than the PS2 version you can find for $20 in some stores?  Answer:  Not much.  Graphics Visually, Red Faction II looked better on PS2 six months ago (for a PS2 game).  On Xbox, it just isn't anything special.  The anti-aliasing is in full command, so you don't get lots shimmer or jaggies and the framerate is locked at a very consistent 60fps.  But there are areas, especially around water, where the textures get completely washed out and the game looks far from phenomenal.  However, kudos to the fantastic death animations and the vivid explosions.  If only the guns looked a bit more impressive in your hands, the colors were a bit richer, and the textures a bit more detailed.  Not a bad looking game at all, but up against the Xbox games of 2003, it's just not jaw-dropping in any way.  Sound Red Faction II is a minimalist game in many ways in terms of sound.  The score is well-understated and even the fantastic booms from exploding tanks never really rock the house.  There's some sparse dialogue as well, with enemies occasionally saying things like, ~You killed my friend!~ and ~Oh God, I'm on fire!!!!~  But these snippets are a bit too few and far between.  The score, though often just hiding in the background of the sound field, is mostly techno beats the likes of the original Terminator movie.  It doesn't contrast the game's style, but it seems fairly ordinary, with no pleasant surprises to offer.    Those extra months waiting to bring RF II to Xbox didn't merit any audio improvements.  Though the game will play across all five channels of your stereo, it's not true surround.  Instead just about every piece of sound is equally distributed.  Even to the center speaker.    Red Faction II is fun, certainly, but the single-player is a bit too linear for my tastes and the game ends well before my bedtime.  This really isn't a game to buy if you are only planning on playing it alone as you can easily finish the single-player mode in one weekend.  However, if multiplayer is your thing, then RF II can be a lot of fun.  But I would rather have had this bad boy come out a year late if it meant Xbox Live support or at least System Link.  If neither of those matter to you, then this is about as top notch a multiplayer mode as you can found outside of Halo.  But in the end, I found RF II a bit of a letdown because of the lack of Xbox enhancements.", "date": "Apr 1, 2003"}
