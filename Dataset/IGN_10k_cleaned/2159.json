{"name": "C&C: Yuri's Revenge", "name_review": "Command & Conquer: Yuri's Revenge", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/10/09/command-conquer-yuris-revenge", "text": "It should be said by way of explanation that the game title as it appears above is merely a truncated version of the complete title, Command & Conquer Yuri's Revenge, a Red Alert 2 expansion pack. We thought that that was maybe a little excessive so we toned it down a bit. Still, so as not to confuse grandparents and spouses who are looking to buy the game as a gift, we wanted to go ahead and say that the actual name of the game is much longer than we're pretending.  But even with what Mark Twain would call a sobriquetfluous title, Yuri's Revenge is pure gold (and the largest expansion in Westwood's history). And while it certainly doesn't live up to the scale of expansions set by the superlative The Conquerors expansion for Age of Kings, there's more than enough originality lumped in with the obligatory 16 extra hours of gameplay to lure even the most apathetic gamers back for more.  Tacked onto the end of the previous game, Yuri's Revenge is about the revenge that some guy has, some guy named Yuri. Yuri was the former minister of mind control for the Soviets. After the Allies capture Moscow, Yuri goes into hiding and begins to formulate his own plans to once again venge the parties responsible for his spiritual depantsing. He assembles an army of psychic warriors and some impressive technology to bring about the destruction of both the Allies and the Soviets.   It's up to you to stop him. While the specifics still seem a little confusing (and maybe not altogether logical, even by Red Alert standards), it's definitely keeping in the style of the franchise. To begin with you'll need to grab a time machine and head back into the past and take Yuri out. With seven missions each for the Soviet and Allied campaign, there's about 16 hours of gameplay here. Missions are a nice range. Defending a peace summit at Parliament, fighting house to house in Sydney, and assaulting enemy positions at the base of the Great Pyramid are just three examples.  Tactically the game has changed quite a bit. You're no longer presiding over battles between the Soviets and Allies. Now you're fighting against Yuri's minions. With an impressive array of mind-control techniques at his disposal, Yuri can make short work of your forces. The solution seems to be in long-range weapons and garrisoned structures. This makes snipers and prism tanks much more important than they've been in the past. Yuri's reliance on gatling weapons (which deal greater damage the longer they operate) also necessitates the use of long-range weapons.  But the game does still rely excellent unit balancing. There's a much greater sense here of circular unit supremacy. One unit beats another, beats another, and beats another, which beats the first one. And given that there's a whole new side here, that's no small accomplishment. I was a little saddened that nearly all of the additions came on the side of land-based units. The navies of each side and the air forces could each us a little broadening but since there's a land-based focus throughout the game (except for a single Soviet mission), that's not surprising.  Since Yuri has taken all of his units away from the Soviets, there are quite a few holes left in their arsenal. The new hero unit, Boris, is an excellent long-range sniper and can also call in MiG strikes against ground targets. Useful. The Siege Chopper strengthens the Soveit's weak air arm. These vehicles can deploy into fixed gun emplacements. A new Spy Plane allows the Soviet player to reveal hidden parts of the map. As long as they're not shot down -- which they almost always are, at least if they're flying over anything important.  New Soviet structures have been added as well. Where Soviet players used to have to make do with Cloning Vats to swell their ranks, the new game provides discounted vehicle production through the Industrial Plant. The Battle Bunker is a fixed emplacement that you can fortify with conscripts. This makes an excellent defense as it can be repaired directly from your treasury while still giving you the benefit of fortification.  The Allied player benefits greatly from having SEALS as part of his (or her, hi gals) regular arsenal. Brand new are the Guardian GIs. These are like regular GIs except that they have rocket launchers and are uncrushable when deployed. Overall, they're probably more expensive than they're worth, especially considering the number of buildings that you can use to garrison your regular GIs. Still, they make a nice anti-air defense. Robot Tanks are a nice counter to Yuri's psychic attacks and are pretty useful in general. Battle Fortress are moving fortifications that can even crush vehicles and walls.  Fortified units also gain levels of veterancy. It's not unusual to deploy soldiers out of a building and find that most of them have been promoted once or twice. New tech buildings add to your power supply or repair your vehicles. Best of all, the hospitals and machine shops now repair your vehicles at a constant rate regardless of where they are on the map. This makes battles for these structures much more intense.  Lots of new multiplayer functionality has been added as well. Apart from better game searches, player paging and more flexible map controls, there's also the option to play as Yuri. To be totally honest, I'm not that fond of his units. But considering that I didn't like the Ordos or the Zerg, then maybe it's just me. They're certainly distinct and well conceived but they really focus on his ability to control enemies' minds. That's the part I'm not so good at. Maybe if I had a chance to practice with them in a single player campaign...Anyway, the new skirmish and coop maps are a blast.  So it's a big ol' expansion and more than worth the wait. There are a few features still missing (like the undeploy command or the need to reassign groups after they've been mind-controlled, oh, and the silly par times for missions are still in) but overall the product is solid. The single player game might have included a campaign for Yuri but, again, this is a minor issue. Yuri's Revenge gives a really excellent game some really impressive enhancements.  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
