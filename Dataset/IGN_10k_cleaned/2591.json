Built with unsymmetrical vertical panels straddled to minimalistic frames, riding on four wheels, of which the rear ones are uneven, and traveling up to speeds of 170 mph, the spring car is a bizarre contraption apparently invented for a Willy Wonka story or crafted for an 18th century utopian race by a wacked British novelist. Perhaps that's a bit over-the-top, but it's not too far off.   After Sony Computer Entertainment Europe dropped Ratbag's hardcore racing game last year, Infogrames smartly picked up the racer, newly entitled World of Outlaws: Sprint Cars 2002. The first game of its kind on PlayStation 2, the game happily shortened to ~WOO,~ delivers a unique driving experience. Simplistically, it's part rally racing, part NASCAR racing. But that's a little too whittled of a statement to fully describe WOO. It's all skill-based, brutally competitive racing, replete with a steep learning curve, multi-car pileups, and a strangely wonderful circular rhythmic experience that's like no other racing game.    The sport is immensely popular across the US I'm told, but despite it's popularity, I feel WOO is a niche racer that has a narrow appeal. It's more simulation that arcade in style, it's wild to a certain degree, but the constant circling motion of driving around in loops is more than redundant and ultimately off-putting, and the learning curve is steep and slow. It's a strange, narrowly focused kind of racing that's enjoyable, but you've got to be completely dedicated to like this kind of sim experience.    Gameplay  There arent that many racing games on the face of the planet offering a bunch of courses that are all variations of the basic circle. WOO is all about ovals, baby, ovals. The female symbol, the circle of life, the continuous flow of never-ending races, ah yes, and in some cases, the elliptical equivalent of a planet circumnavigating the sun. The oval, an elongated circle, is the basic environment on which you drive these wonderfully powerful cars. You drive around and around and around.    Much like Nascar, Sprint Car Racing takes gamers into the real-life world of competitive racing on oval circuits. The 12 real-life tracks and handful of fantasy courses enable gamers to take incredibly powerful vehicles, which attain speeds of 170 miles per hour, on slanted dirt tracks for a thrilling, precision-bound affair. The experience is like Nascar in that you're constantly circling around a track, and partially like rally racing in that it takes place on purely dirt courses. But it's different from each because neither puts players in the position of managing powerslides over dirt courses for the entirety of the race. With Sprint Car Racing, the art of the race is learning how to master powerslides into a turn and skillfully and speedily gyrating out into the stretch, only to do it again and again.    Set up for players to get in a quick race (Single Race), enter into a Championship, or develop a Career, WOO is deeper than it seems. The Career mode follows the same line of thinking introduced in Gran Turismo. Here, racers earn sponsorships for cash, so that in addition to winning races, they can pay to travel to different courses in various parts of the country. Cars take damage, too, so they constantly need repair, which costs bucks. And of course, when you earn enough money, buying new cars is crucial to expanding your career. It's a good setup, and it makes for an excellent, long Career mode.    There are many truly wild thrills to experience here. Each race contains as many as 12 to 24 opponent vehicles (depending on the race) and the narrow oval courses are usually crowded, intensely swift affairs that create an amazing sensation of tension, resulting in exhilarating racing gameplay. There are races in which I never touched a single opponent car, but didn't finish in the top three, despite my knowledge of the course and excellent handling during the race. In other events, opponent cars may turn into you, following their own selected paths, resulting in complete disaster and a multicar pile-up, or which may result in just disaster for you, or as I experienced, which benefited me more than once to take the lead.    Which brings up to major points, the opponent AI and the physics engine. Ratbag's opponents AI represents some of the best or at least most unpredictable I've ever seen in a racing game. Each race is completely different due to the unusual patterns that these cars follow. Programmed as part of the Neural Network AI, the cars sometimes do completely random things, like humans, but more often than not, they drive extremely well, taking you on the inside of a turn, busting into your projected path, erroneously bumping into another vehicle, only to lose the lead, or to simply drive well, like a seasoned vet. Cars will pick up speed in the end and try to edge you out in the final lap, or they may not even come close. The end result is unpredictability, which sometimes means losing, but it always keeps the game fresh. And for a game that demands driving around in circles for as many as 15-plus laps, it's crucial.    Another aspect I'm keen on is the superb physics engine. The light-weight cars deliver a strange mix of featherweight lightness and the powerful force of speed blended with regular old gravity, combining in a unique driving experience -- one that's re-created exceptionally well on PS2. From the first-person perspective (there is also a cockpit view, short behind the vehicle view, and long behind the vehicle view), players can see the cars pop wheelies at the starting line (due to the 800-horsepowered engines), and feel the immensely powerful touch of another car that could send your vehicle or it into a deadly wipeout. The cars deliver an amazing sense of response sensitivity, through the earlier vehicles are slower and harder to drive than the faster, better-handling vehicles you can later earn.    Although it's tough to see on the shorter courses, the tracks actually change in form, building up ruts, gullies, and uneven lines that affect the speed and line of your car. The tracks are alternately mixed with plain old dirt, looser around the edges, but more compact on the center. Some tracks are wider and open around the edges, giving more opportunities to drive wide, while others are narrow and fenced in, creating a tighter, more intense race.    After you get the feeling for the race, one discovers there's a certain rhythmic feel to the circular driving experience that's unusually intoxicating. The feeling is naturally strongest while attaining the fastest of speeds, but it's best earned by spinning into a turn just right, managing the speed perfectly, and gaining speed out of the turn. When a powerslide is handled perfectly, the whole experience feels like a natural gyration, like a magnet pulling you in and slinging out you outward again, perhaps the same way it would feel to be in a satellite and whisked around a planet, using its gravity to propel you further in to space.   So if the game is so wonderful and exotic, what's the downside? For me, the big faults are inherent to the sport itself. While the cars are exotic and blisteringly powerful, and the skill required to rhythmically slide into and out of turns is challenging, and the game set-up is much like Gran Turismo, none of them entirely outweigh the boredom of driving around in the same circle 15 times in a row. I could get into it for a while, and when I was deeply entrenched in the game's best parts, I was into it, but as soon as I had to eat dinner, or go to sleep, there wasn't that deep, longing to pick up the controller again.    The combination of the game's steep learning curve (I recommend starting off in easy to get a grip with the game's feel), the constant interruption of mild to long loading times, and the likelihood of not winning much in the first three hours of play isn't that charming. And no matter how many laps one adds to the track make the game any more fascinating.    It takes a long time to progress, it's more of a sim than an arcade game, which is by no means a criticism, but WOO ends up being very technical, very tinkery, and hard to gauge often. Cars can be customized to the particular tracks, but the game interface doesn't explain well what each change does. There are very few hints that tell, or even hint, to the driver how to change the wheel ratio, the wing slant, or the differential, among other things.    Graphics  When it comes to car models, Ratbag offers an excellent batch of wild looking vehicles. Granted, they all look the same, but they are distinguishable in Career mode, since players earn different sponsors, whose logos and branding images fill all of the cars' blank spots. Ratbag kept its eyes on the detail here, so racers can see their driver, steering the moving wheel, the full cage in which they sit and drive, and all of the bars and rigs that keep the winged cars together in full polygonal, texture-mapped glory.    Since vehicles do engage in harsh pile-ups, spinouts, and multiple flips, cars take physical damage that definitely affects ones performance. I once barely missed a giant six-car pileup, only to see the parts of the various cars drifting around the course on my second lap around the track. In other instances, I took on a five flip crash that crumpled the crap out of my wings, ruining good placement (but at least I finished the race).    Other than those major graphic strengths, the only other major graphic benefits in WOO are the subtle changes in the track's deformation, the ability to drive at night or in the day, and the flying mud and dirt.    The crowds are average, the landscapes are plain and forgettable, and the courses are by nature dirt tracks, so they don't look like much. The only occasional graphic problem I could see was the occasional hiccup, in which the game skipped a frame due to too many cars on screen at once. This happens rarely and it doesn't affect gameplay, but you can see it.    Sound  Well, well, well, the sound in WOO is not really a mixed bag at all, it's all pretty bad, actually. The annoyingly boring menu soundtrack is the bulk of what you'll here, and the spongy bass and stroking guitar rock is totally off-putting, and what makes it worse is the extra weird production problem that makes it sound as if the music is coming from a submarine deep beneath the Pacific. It's warblely.    The crowd sounds are entirely generic, and the crash sounds are listless. Thankfully, the cars themselves deliver a rich, deep engine sound that's hard to forget. You know you're driving a powerful car here because of the enormous roar of the engine, and the spinning, slipping wheels that grind along the dirt surfaces. World of Outlaws: Sprint Cars 2002 is an exceptionally unique game, so for those driving fans who simply want to handle an entirely exotic, different type of race, this is for you. The cars deliver an excellent sense of speed, power, and sliding motion, and they feel quick and responsive, lightweight and yet weighted down by a phenomenally powerful G-forces. And you get to constantly pull off powerslides all game long. WOO offers unique racing, but also a slow, steady, grinding learning curve, too, and due to the nature of the constantly circular driving experience, many gamers will be put off by the redundancy and sameness of the courses. It's certainly an alternative to NASCAR, and it is truly unlike any other racer, but it's so narrowly focused that it didn't draw me in like so many other racers do. I liked it, but only for a short while.", "date": "Apr 3, 2002"}
