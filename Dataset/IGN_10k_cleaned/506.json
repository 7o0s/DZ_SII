The Warrior Princess hits the console as a 3D fighter courtesy of developer Saffire, which also brought us games Rainbow Six, Top Gear Rally 2 and Bio Freaks. Not surprisingly, Xena, Warrior Princess: The Talisman of Fate, as it's called, shares quite a bit in common with Saffire's other freaky 3D fighter, boasting wide-open, circular 3D arenas, a super smooth framerate and some top-notch visuals. But it goes a step further with a particularly enjoyable four-player simultaneous battle mode plus it features all of the campy goodness of the popular television series. Unfortunately, all of this is brought together under a decidedly shallow fighting engine that offers only a handful of executable moves and combinations per character.  The Facts:   11 fighters based on characters from the television show and one original boss character. Character specific weapons and attacks. Innovative taunting feature will reflect each character's personality traits. 11 Huge environment in full 3D. Four different modes of play. Simultaneous four-player action. Rumble Pak compatible. Memory Pak compatible.   Gameplay The Nintendo 64's current selection of fighting game is, well, pathetic. There is really no other way to describe it. Titus' Xena, Warrior Princess: The Talisman of Fate isn't exactly the Soul Calibur of the console, but it's certainly no slouch either.   Players select from 11 characters including Xena herself, Gabrielle, Caesar, Ephiny, Ares, Velasca, Callisto, Joxer, Autoclycus and more; essentially all of the big stars from the television series. Once the game has been beaten, an additional boss character, which Saffire created specifically for the game, is also unlocked and can be used. The options are pretty straightforward, though there are a few extras here and there. Three real gameplay modes, Quest, Versus and Roster, make up the selection. There is also a practice mode by which new moves can be learned.  The fighting action in Talisman of Fate is fun, though very basic and not all too deep. Characters are controlled with the analog stick or D-Pad depending on player preference. Various punches and kicks are assigned to the C buttons. However, players can also pull off special moves (usually projectiles) by tapping the analog stick or D-Pad in conjunction with the C buttons. So, for example, we can execute Xena's flying kick by pressing back, forward, C-Right. Or, we can make her throw off a projectile by pressing back, forward, C-Left. It's fairly simple stuff and it works well and the moves are generally impressive.  The problem is that it isn't hard at all to exhaust a character's arsenal quickly as, quite frankly, there isn't much of a selection -- roughly a handful of special moves per character plus twice that number of regular kicks, punches and variations of each. In fact, the list of executable moves and combinations is so basic that developer Saffire has eliminated the use of both the A and B buttons almost entirely. We can always justify this by saying, ~Well, Xena isn't trying to be the next Tekken,~ and that's certainly true enough, but at the same time the Xena license will only hold gamers' attention for so long and then what are we left with?    Well, an excellent four-player mode, that's what. Save for Super Smash Bros., still the best fighter for Nintendo 64, Talisman of Fate is the only Nintendo 64 brawler to feature a four-player simultaneous mode and, to its credit, it's very well done. Gamers without friends (you know who you are) have the option of playing against up to three computer-controller characters in single-player mode, or, a party of four actual humans can go at it as well. It's even possible to play two-on-two against each other. It's in the multiplayer mode that we finally find a use for the A button, and it's a good one. Let's imagine the following: four characters on one screen fighting out. Now imagine you'd like to hurl a projectile at Xena, who is caught in a group fight on the other side of the screen. What can you do? Well, press the A button and a little arrow will pop up above the head of the opponent you want to target. Voila. That simple, really. Get tired of beating on Xena? Well, press A again and the arrow will switch to a different character. You're locked on. This works wonderfully and keeps the multiplayer fights flowing without confusion.  Graphics The Talisman of Fate is, like Bio Freaks before it, remarkably pretty. The game runs on an amazing 3D engine that never slows down in one-on-one action and rarely hitches in four-player battles against the computer. This, as long-time IGN64 readers know, makes us very happy as we hate nothing more than a crap sense of fluidity in our games. Even more, though, the game's visuals are highly detailed and varied. 3D polygonal characters, soft-skinned and well modeled, look right on par with their television counterparts. Meanwhile, the game's 3D arenas, also modeled after recognizable locations from the show, look splendid with crisp textures, animated background effects and lots of variation. The camera system hardly ever fails to deliver the right angle, staying close to characters in one-on-one matches and panning back considerably in multiplayer bouts, or, as players move further away from each other. And again, it all happens with an outstanding framerate, something we can't stress enough.   If we are to be nitpickers, though, we should note that some of the character animation is a bit awkward looking. Xena and friends move almost too fast at times and some moves come off as robotic and stiff. Nothing appears particularly poor, though, and only those really looking to dig on -- like us - will even care.  Sound The sound effects and music in Talisman of Fate are clear and appropriate. As one might expect, the game features a strong selection of grunts, howls, death cries, punches, kicks, bangs, etc., etc. This all works fine, and yet we were hoping for more. It's a licensed title and as such, gamers will want to hear all the familiar voices and trademark catch phrases from the television show that it is based on. Unfortunately, none of these are in the game. In fact, all of the voice-overs -- grunts and the like -- are done by talent at Saffire and not by the stars of the series. Definitely a bit disappointing to be sure, especially when we consider how campy the Xena television show is; certainly some of the funny one-liners would have translated brilliantly to the videogame format. With all of this said, though, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the tunes and sound effects in the game. Xena, Warrior Princess: The Talisman of Fate is a surprisingly good fighter that brings the license to Nintendo 64 in top form. Featuring a remarkable 3D engine, pretty graphics and an outstanding four-player mode to boot, the game has a lot to offer and does its best to disprove the theory that all licensed videogames are doomed to be poor. But at the same time, the game fails to deliver a long, challenging quest with only 11 playable characters and arenas to choose from and a simplistic (though fun) fighting engine that's just not very deep. In the end, this game comes recommended despite some definite shortcomings. Talisman of Fate perfectly accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is bring the Xena franchise home to Nintendo 64 owners as a fun, simplistic fighter. The only problem is that fighting fans are going to want more fight and less license and Talisman of Fate just doesn't have the goods.", "date": "Dec 8, 1999"}
