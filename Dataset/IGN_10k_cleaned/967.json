It's not like the developers at Climax didn't have any experience in the racing-adventure. The first two Runabout games appeared on the Playstation (under the moniker Felony 11-51 in the United States), and were some of the first mission-based, drive-anywhere racing games. But despite massive environments, plenty of stuff to ram into, and screaming innocents, the element of control was never quite there. And while Super Runabout on the Dreamcast certainly looks a good deal better than its PSX brethren, those nasty elements of fiddly control  along with hellacious physics  bring the whole package down, down, down. Super Runabout is best summed up as ~Crazy Taxi with missions.~ The  game takes place in a convincing facsimile of San Francisco, which is even more massive and open-ended than the maps in everyone's favorite cabbie sim.  There are two scenarios you can play: ~The Poor Have no Leisure,~ where you assume the role of backwater bumpkins who traverse the streets of San Francisco, or ~Bad News has Wings,~ where you're placed into the combat boots of San Francisco's finest.  The interface works through a clever ~Office~ setup, where you move a camera through your team's base of operations. Once you've selected the first mission, you're given a surprisingly wide selection of cars to choose from  there are also a handful of minibikes to scoot around on. Though the vehicles aren't officially licensed, you can tell what they're supposed to be (my favorite of the bunch is the supercharged CRX hatchback).  The missions themselves consist of scavenger hunts, racing around, or ramming specific vehicles. You're allotted a certain amount of time to complete your mission, and can sustain a good amount of damage before your ride is turned into scrap. That's a good thing, too  this virtual version of San Fran is packed with opposing traffic, bloodthirsty cops, and more roadside obstacles than you can shake a stick at. One nice touch is the Property-Damage-O-Meter at the bottom of the screen  it keeps track of how much stuff you've ~accidentally~ destroyed with your high-speed shenanigans.   So the right pieces should be in place  you've got lotsa missions, a garage full of speed machines, and a big city full of breakable stuff to play in. But sadly, it all comes back to control  and Super Runabout is an utter mess.  Let's take a look at Crazy Taxi: the driving controls are absurdly nonrealistic, but it doesn't matter -- cities consist of straight roads and 90-degree intersections, and the ability to corner at 100MPH is a necessity. In Crazy Taxi,  the faster you go, the better your cab handles, resulting in a high-speed rush as you blow through the back-streets. Super Runabout sins by taking a step in the opposite direction, by including realistic driving controls for all the vehicles.  This means you'll need to gently brake down to 30mph before taking turns, and you can kiss your ass goodbye when it comes to high-speed evasive maneuvers. If Super Runabout was a simple racer, the controls would be fine  but they're not suited for a city-based game like this. While the concept of ripping through downtown San Fran in a big-wheeled 4X4 is oh-so-appealing, it's both tedious and annoying in practice. The only vehicles I enjoyed controlling were the motorcycles, since they can come to a quick spin-out stop by hitting the accelerator and brake at the same time.  This is coupled with the game's physics system, which is utter garbage. The majority of the cars feel like they're floating a few inches above the road surface, and the collision detection is unbearable. In the first stage, you have to ram a runaway cable car that's pushing a taxi  and through some bug of programming, I managed to get my vehicle stuck inside the taxi. But that's not all: I've managed to ~hang~ my vehicles on ledges with no hopes for escape, bounced down Lombard street in a most unrealistic fashion, and clipped through streetlamps without slowing down.  But that's not all  if you manage to fall into the water, it's instantly game over. This is made all the more irritating when you have to drive along narrow piers, where the slightest error in handling results in instant death. But that's not all  the developers at Climax also placed explosive barrels on the road as well, which will send you spiraling airborne to a watery grave. I swear, a game hasn't pissed me off this bad since the Japanese version Super Magnetic Niu-Niu.  Even the mighty PowerVR chipset can't back up this game, which has been programmed  rather inexplicably  in Windows CE. I have absolutely no idea why this was done  the game wasn't ported from the PC, and the graphical boost you get by using one of Sega's development libraries is more than marginal. The frame rate chugs along from 20 to 30fps, and the pop-in... oh, god, the pop-in. How could this game's development have gotten so far, lookin' so ugly? And the list of embarrassing niggles goes on and on  spelling errors, texture weirdness, seals on the pier screaming at you in English. If the American distributor for this game wants to do a good job on cleaning this game up, they're gonna have their hands full.  All in all, Super Runabout is an average game that's riddled with sloppiness in almost every category. Though I found myself having fun once or twice during countless hours of tedious gameplay, the overall experience was pretty painful. Even if you're a fan of the first Runabout games, hold off for the American release (through Interplay under the name Motortown Madness)  I still think there's a decent game hiding beneath the surface here. As to whether or not anyone can uncover it is still up in the air.  -- Colin ~Drivin' Maniac~ Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "May 31, 2000"}
