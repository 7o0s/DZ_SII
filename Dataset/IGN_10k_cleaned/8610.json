{"name": "Mole Mania", "name_review": "Mole Mania", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/06/17/mole-mania", "text": "is a great game that most folks, including myself, have overlooked for a long time. I finally found this game in a discount bin and decided to give it a try. What a great little game! As the story opens, we see the family of our hero, Muddy the mole, kidnapped by an evil farmer named Jinbe. Grandpa Hint (should tell you a little about his role in the game), who witnessed the whole incident, gives Muddy a note from Jinbe challenging Muddy to get his family back (avenging a theft or kidnapping seems to be the motivation behind an inordinate amount of Nintendo games). So you're off, puzzling your way through Jinbe Land to get your wife and seven little...molelets back.   Features  Two battery-backed save slots in the quest game. Single-player quest game and two-player head-to-head play. Excellent game control. Difficulty level: Medium.   The Game The main action of Mole Mania centers around Muddy's solving levels composed of single-screen puzzles. Each puzzle contains an above ground and below ground screen. Simply stated, your goal is to get to the exit of each screen. This sounds easy enough, and in the beginning, it is. If a wall or enemy blocks your path above ground, Muddy can simply dig below, where the layout is different. At first, Muddy will only need to use a combination of above- and below ground movement to progress. Then things get more complex. Enemies begin to appear. Muddy can throw objects like balls and cabbages to destroy these. The balls are also used to smash blocks obstructing your path. Cabbages can be collected and dropped down any of your holes to acquire health points. However, if a ball is dropped down one of these holes, it will be returned to its original location (can be much more frustrating than it sounds). It is possible (and probable) that you will screw up on a screen (usually by digging an ill-advised hole). This can be remedied by accessing the submenu and resetting the screen, or by simply retreating to the previous screen and reentering. As you move farther along in the game, more items are introduced as part of the puzzles, including barrels, weights, movement arrows, elbow pipes, etc. Each affects your ability to complete the puzzle in a different way. Thankfully, Grandpa Hint's signposts are everywhere, introducing you to each new aspect of gameplay as you move along.   The feel of solving puzzles a screen at a time is very reminiscent of the dungeons in Link's Awakening. And like that game, each level of Mole Mania has items to collect that will improve your ability to complete a level (and your score). There's a map, that shows the grid-like layout of each level and a locator that shows the location of the level boss and bonus stage. The bonus stage pits Muddy against Jinbe in a timed contest for 20 points. You have 60 seconds to drop all of the cabbages on the screen. You must do this while avoiding Jinbe, who tries to fill in your holes, pausing only to beat you about the head and neck with his hoe. Getting hit, of course, costs time. You can try as many times as you like to complete the bonus stage. Similarly, if you miss any of the points in a level, you can go back and try for them as many times as you like. Play is battery backed and the level select screen shows exactly what percentage of each level you have completed.   One nice thing about the game is its non-linear format. Once you solve level 1, you can play levels 2 through 7 in any order you please. You can leave a level at any time and travel to another by accessing the submenu. Levels can be completed in different ways, but always end with the confrontation of a level boss.   Though the quest game is the main attraction on this cart, Nintendo has also included a very nice versus game. This turns out to be a souped-up version of the bonus game. In a head-to-head match, players each take a turn playing Muddy while the other plays Jinbe. Again, Muddy must sink a field of cabbages in the allotted time. Muddy's wife Maggie appears occasionally and will help him dig holes. Jinbe can now throw his hoe, while Muddy can acquire boots that will speed him up for a brief period. Players may choose from a selection of 16 different maps to play on and can each select a difficulty level.    The graphics in Mole Mania are standard Nintendo fare. Muddy waddles amusingly through well-drawn, if perhaps redundant, screens. Though the game precedes the Game Boy Color, it looks quite nice on that system, as well as on the Super Game Boy. There are several nice cutscenes throughout the game. I especially like the ones at the end of each level where Muddy plays with each newly-freed family member.   The music and sound effects are great in this one. The music is rich and well-crafted and backs the play nicely. Sound effects are sparse but well-placed.   For those of you who loved Zelda: Link's Awakening and are eagerly awaiting Conker's Pocket Tales, may I suggest this title. The blend of puzzles and adventure may be exactly what you need to tide you over. The play is fast-paced and fun, and may keep you occupied for hours at a time. I haven't owned this game long enough to complete it, but I can't imagine growing tired of it. The versus game is also a nice bonus and adds replay value. At a bargain bin price it's worth picking up an extra copy to take advantage of it.  Lately I've encountered a string of really bad Game Boy Color titles. They just seem to miss the point entirely. The recent purchase of several monochrome classics has convinced me that a lot of these pre-colorization carts deserve a second (and third, and fourth...) look. Mole Mania is as good a place to start as any. There are copies all over the place (often at reduced price) so there's no excuse not to treat yourself to this lesser known Nintendo gem.
