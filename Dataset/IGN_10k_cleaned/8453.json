Sony Online's port of the arcade sequel, Gauntlet II, is a perfect example of that. 21 years after it first debuted in arcades, the follow-up to one of the most successful dungeon crawlers of all time may have flashes of fun, but it doesn't pack nearly as much punch as it used to.   Granted, Backbone Entertainment has done an okay job of rebuilding the original coin-op for PlayStation 3; Online Leaderboards, four-player network support, and 1080p graphics were obviously not in the original, and that's a definite plus for veterans. Then again, given the state of existing PS Network and Xbox Live Arcade titles already out there, those features are expected necessities.   Unfortunately, What Gauntlet II doesn't have are the essential additions needed to meet today's expectations. Voice chat support, for example, has been omitted entirely and that makes playing with friends across the 'net a frustrating exercise. An online session ends the moment that somebody quits (which is lame enough already) and it's made even worse by the paucity of communication because you won't see it coming. Of course, this means that players aren't able to join sessions in progress either, and even if they could, they still can't save their place to pick up where they left off should something came up.   Memories are sometimes better left as just that. When dealing with 100 levels in total and what could take in upwards or three to six hours to complete, that's a pretty big deal.   If playing offline is your thing, then Gauntlet II fares quite a bit better. With people sitting next to you (joining and leaving without consequence, by the way) the game's original strengths are more easily identified. After all, Gauntlet was designed with the multiplayer party experience in mind and its challenging enemies and oft-changing stages keep your on your toes. Of course, control issues associated with Gauntlet's 8-way joystick will pop up now and then (particularly when firing diagonally), but that problem is because of the software's age and not because of a port hitch. Expect plenty of challenge.   But here's the rub: Despite its moments of entertainment, Gauntlet II gets repetitive quickly regardless if you're playing offline or on. Even with four different classes to choose from (the Elf, Warrior, Valkyrie, and Wizard) the gameplay always boils down to the same infinite echo -- run your greaves off, mash the fire button, find some keys, unlock a few gates, repeat for 100 levels. And you thought Dynasty Warriors was cyclic...For five bucks, Gauntlet II isn't the worst deal on the PlayStation Store, but its repetition and lack of extras don't make it the best one either. There are much newer and more interesting options already available for roughly the same amount of money (flOw, Lemmings, and Mortal Kombat II to name a few) and the poorly-executed online options absolutely seal its fate. Unless you're a diehard Gauntlet maniac, your attention is better served elsewhere.", "date": "May 9, 2007"}
