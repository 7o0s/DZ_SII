There are standard two player splitscreen mode, single race, time trial and challenge game modes, but it's TIR's career mode that drives everything. Opponents that act and react to each other's emotions and maneuvers during a race is supposed to be what sets Total Immersion apart from other racers, but this mechanic ends up being a lot more subtle than you'd expect. Since this main gimmick ultimately doesn't help TIR stand out, the game ends up looking and playing like so many other racers.  Razorworks is the developer behind Total Immersion and they've included and handful of licensed auto manufacturers like BMW, Audi and Panoz, but you won't find the depth and breadth of makes and models that characterize most racing sims. There are only a handful of tracks that you race in over and over, but they include real world venues like Hockenheim and Rockingham.   In any race there are 18 vehicles divided into three classes (GT, GTS and prototype) on the track. You're only responsible for winning your class race, but the presence of the other, more powerful cars does make a difference. If you're lapped by the lead car and they complete the last lap, the race is over. Likewise you can interact with every driver on the track and elicit reactions and emotions out of them regardless of class. All of those cars on the track helps make the experience real and they can even be used for strategic purposes when the traffic gets thick.    The career mode ends up falling short because, simply put, the driver-emotion system doesn't lead to any consequences. During any race, you can tap B to toggle on the Emotion Indicator to see what's going on in the minds of your opponents. Supposedly, a green triangle over the car means they're driving defensively and hogging the best line, blue means they're excessively confident and red means they're extremely aggressive. The intensity of the emotion is indicated by the richness of the color. Pink means they're getting upset while bright red means they're livid. This game would be a totally immersive experience if these colors and emotions actually led to action on the part of the other drivers. Instead you get to see how they're feeling, whether or not they're holding a grudge against you (indicated by exclamation marks of varying sizes) and that's it. And really the only emotion you're going to see consistently is anger, because bumping other drivers and bouncing off them to get inside a sharp turn is part of any decent racing game. But the problem is, even if you constantly bump drivers and get them all fired up, they're not going to do anything except take it. Like Deebo in the 1995 classic Friday, you stand unopposed with your opponents posturing like they're going to do something but deep down everybody knows they're not.   Once you understand that there are no consequences for driving aggressively, then the whole driver/emotion system is rendered pointless. Bumping into and pissing off one of the super speedy prototype cars, while you're still pushing your lowly GT ride is supposed to stick in their memory once you get up to that level. But really, the prototypes are no different than any other competitor on the track and you end up regarding all other drivers as the same: they're enemies. Just because their emotion meters are red or green or full of exclamation points, it doesn't change how you should approach the remainder of the race or your career. Your job is to compete and win so it doesn't matter that the guy in front of you is angry, you're still going to rub him off of that barrier if it comes down to a choice between him or you. Even if you're talking about one of your teammates, you can piss them off too and they'll still go out like punks.  Unlocking new cars means unlocking new teams to whom you an offer your services. Successful runs through multiple seasons in career mode is the way to do this and the pace at which you open up cool new stuff is much faster than in other racers like Sega GT 2002. Some teams will want you to audition for them in a test race before offering you a spot on your team.    One of the more clever innovations in TIR, and one that should be adopted by all racing sims, is the Race Engineer function. You can tweak and adjust several elements of your car like the camber, suspension, gear ratio etc. or you can use the Race Engineer to automatically optimize your vehicle for a particular track. By entering the practice mode of a particular race and engaging the engineer, you're actually testing out the performance of your car as it is. As you complete practice laps, the engineer will make adjustments to your brakes, suspension and gear ratio on-the-fly. It's important to race clean laps so that the Race Enginner can do his thing and really fine tune your ride. If your lap time is slow because you've got too much drag, he can fix it, but a slow lap time due to numerous crashes isn't his area of expertise, it's yours.    Graphics  Total Immersion features some good and some bad in the graphics department. The reflections off of windows are genuine (not simulated) and smoother than what we saw from Project Gotham Racing's reflections. The car models themselves leave a lot to be desired, especially since there are so few of them included in the game. With no car damage and clean racing environments, the only animation to consider is the steering wheel turning when you're in the cockpit view.  The level of detail on the cars is a mixed bag since you can plainly read the logos and adverts pasted all over the rides (including the Playstation 2 logo on the Audi TT) but the distinguishing characteristics of the BMW for example are hard to make out. The number of polygons in Xbox racing games is usually much higher than what we've got here.  Oh and the pictures of the racing team managers are scary, especially when they're expressing negative emotions.  Sound  The music is euro-techno, which I guess is a matter of taste, but only draws attention to the fact that there's no custom soundtrack functionality in Total Immersion Racing. Plus all presentation options can only be adjusted from the front end menu. If you're in the middle of the race and don't want to hear that grinding music anymore, you'll have to wait until you're done racing.   All of the sound effects are mediocre. There are unique engine sounds for the different vehicles and the voice over from your pit crew is decent. But overall, during a race the soundspace feels really empty.  Total Immersion Racing makes an adequate budget racing game because of its nice low price, but you are getting what you pay for. I was disappointed by the futility of the emotion/driver system because it left me with just another racing game that doesn't do anything particularly well. The concept behind the system is promising and would work better in a more arcadey, over-the-top racer where battling opponents would be nice game within the game. With the paltry amount of tracks and cars, you'll be done with this one in the blink of an eye and won't have much to show for it.", "date": "Dec 6, 2002"}
