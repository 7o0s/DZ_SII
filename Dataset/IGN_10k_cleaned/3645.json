Marketing departments everywhere are doing such a thorough job that it seems every other day, a new entertainment property emerges that is heralded as the be-all, end-all experience ever to grace a movieplex, television screen or concert stage. Usually, the ~new best thing~ cannot stand up under the weight of expectation.If the universal hype machine had never been fired up, perhaps folks would just sit back and enjoy their movies, games and music. But as it stands, everyone is expecting the most mind-blowing, orgasmic experience of their lives every time they sit in a theater or pop a game in their console or PC. The second Matrix film, The Matrix Reloaded has been playing to mixed reviews, partially due to the rampant hype that has been unleashed by the creators, media and fans. As the tagline states, no matter where you are, ~The Matrix Has You.~Enter Enter the Matrix. Developed by Shiny and published by Atari, it's the first game ever to exploit the uber-lucrative Matrix license. It's impossible to know what kind of game would have to be shipped in order to avoid disappointment, but it's easy to see that Enter the Matrix is not that game.Hype aside, what it is, is an above-average action game that incorporates cool elements of the film with a decent engine to provide an experience that is similar to Dead to Rights and Max Payne. What's more, the movie's creators went the extra mile to ensure that the game isn't a rehash of what played out onscreen in The Matrix Reloaded. Instead, the movie follows the side-story of Niobe and Ghost, and their missions within the Matrix to help the A Team (Neo, Morpheus and Trinity) succeed. There is tons of exclusive content that was shot at the same time as the film that is inter-cut with the story. That alone is probably worth at least a rental from hardcore Matrix fans, and there are a lot of them in the world.Enter the Matrix Head-to-Head! Now that you know how the game stacks up, why not find out which version is best? IGN Insiders have full access to our highly detailed comparison, including side-by-side screenshots, load time comparisons, and more! It's also complemented by a detailed Video Head-to-Head!Text Comparison | Video ComparisonEnter the Matrix is neither as bad or as good as everyone was predicting. It's good enough to hold your attention, and the fighting and bullet-time elements are very cool, but the game is also deeply flawed. Chalk it up to a development cycle that absolutely needed to put the game in stores by the release of the movie, but do chalk it up. Enter the Matrix is not all that it could be, but it is worth a look as is.GameplayWhen determining what absolutely needed to be included in a Matrix game, Shiny and Atari got about 70% of the stuff they should have. The acrobatic fight scenes and cool bullet-time effects are here in spades. These two elements account for a lot of what made the films cool. Slow-motion kung fu and bad-ass weapons lay the foundation for the action in both the films and the game, and it's as solid a foundation as any. The designers know a thing or two about their audience, and they knew that the fighting had to be great in order to sell this product. In terms of fun, it definitely is. The fighting system allows for a lot of context-sensitive action, meaning you can use your environment to create attacks and movements seen in the movie.Graphics in the game range from excellent to mediocre. Most levels are just too drab to feel exciting. The focus system, which is the basis for all of these maneuvers, allows you to enter ~bullet-time~ (provided you have enough juice in your meter) and see your enemies in a sort of slowed-down reality. This effect is not new to video games. Max Payne, GTA III and Vice City, Dead to Rights and Perfect Dark have all used this sort of battle technique. But in those games (with the exception of Max Payne), it was often more of a gimmick than anything.Enter the Matrix uses its system as the bread-and-butter attack mode throughout the game. Does it hold up? Hell yeah. Ten hours in, it was still just as fun to vault off a wall and kick a baddie in the face as it was the first time. The camera intrudes slightly, and makes the experience less fun than it even could be, but we'll discuss that in the graphics section below. Even with camera issues, pulling out a machine gun and doing cartwheel while firing is pretty exhilarating. What's more, the moves are fairly easy to pull off (and well-explained), making even amateur gamers feel like action studs.Add to that the engaging story that not only has a purpose in Enter the Matrix, but the universe the movies as well, and you've got a compelling product. The film that drives this game is (of course) engaging, to both hardcore fans of the film, and the more casual dabbler. It stands on its own to some degree as a story, while adding to the overall meaning of Reloaded, which should be commended. While you can argue that the Wachowski Brothers haven't quite found their way as game directors, the movie portions of Enter the Matrix, in addition to the in-game cut scenes, prove that they know how to weave a good yarn.However, it's a little disappointing that the game does not allow you to play as the three coolest members of the Matrix universe: Neo, Morpheus or Trinity. It's nice that Enter the Matrix does not follow the same tired license formula of recreating a mini version of the movie within the game, but damn! It would have been cool to take off through the city as Neo, or shoot it out with agents as Trinity. How about giving Morpheus that samurai sword and seeing what he can do? Maybe that's being saved for the game that accompanies Revolutions. Maybe not.At least the game lets you explore the universe from a couple of different angles. You can choose to play as Niobe or Ghost, and who you choose determines the path through the story. Each character's adventure is different, and each emphasizes different strengths. For instance, there is a car escape segment in the game. If you play as Niobe, you will pilot the car GTA-style while Ghost leans out the window and shoots at enemy targets. If you play as Niobe, the level will be on rails, and your objective as Ghost is to defend the car from attackers, a la 007 James Bond: Nightfire. The dual adventures definitely extend gameplay, as you'll want to play it from both sides to see how the stories blend together.As for the driving and shooting segments, those are a mixed bag. The varying gameplay helps keep the hand-to-hand action from getting stale, but none of those sequences are as fun as running around tearing up a building in bullet-time. While it is fun blazing away with Ghost's gun and unlimited ammunition, the action is much better in the Bond game. Still, it's nice to see that Enter the Matrix takes some chances, and tries to mix things up, even though the result is a little lackluster.Also subpar is the level design. While this can probably be attributed to a truncated development cycle, nearly every area in the game has little pockets that feel ~off.~ There are tons of empty rooms where absolutely nothing exists, and it's all too easy to get lost in the endless chains of rooms, many of which look alike.There is an intricate system of tips in the game, which is great for beginners, and helps you get a sense of control early on. You can tell the game was designed with the mainstream dabbler in mind, because at some point, every single puzzle is explained. Whenever you can't find your way for an extended period of time, the operator aboard your ship will help you navigate to the next objective. If you trigger the advice of the operator (basically by sucking), tiny arrows point the way to the next thing you need to do. While this is helpful to give direction in some of the more drab environments, it can be insulting to gamers who know exactly what they are doing. At times, it felt like catering to the mainstream crowd that will invariably flock to this game detracted a little from the puzzle-solving and do-it-yourself elements.Bullet time effects are pulled off extremely well and are -- not surprisingly -- the main attraction in this game. To balance this perhaps, Shiny included a cool Hacking feature for those who like to explore. Not only does it allow you to input cheats, but you can feel as if you're hacking through the game using a DOS prompt, as Neo did in the first film. While some of the things you can do are obvious, you can mess around with the feature and feel as if you're uncovering stuff on your own, which can be a pretty fulfilling feeling.This game is a tricky one. While there are some serious problems in the gameplay department, the overall sensation while playing is enjoyable. The game is fun. It's one of those games that you can sit around with your friends and play, watching how someone pulls off a sick bullet-time maneuever, and reacting with a ~Daaaaaamn!.~ It's a pop tart game. It may not be a gourmet meal, or last very long, but it does taste sweet while it lasts, and gives you a rush, to boot.GraphicsEarly in the development cycle, there were concerns that Enter the Matrix wouldn't get anywhere close to the slick feel of the film. While the gap narrowed between then and now, it never fully came together. Throughout the game, the color pallette is a dull, almost sickly green, with a few muted grays thrown in for spice. That would be fine (as the films' pallettes are not that much broader) if the textures throughout were good. They're not. They vary from polished (the marble in some of the larger indoor sequences) to pretty bad (some of the rock and concrete effects outside).Luckily, the character models are very well rendered. From the hair (especially Niobe's), to the faces, to the flowing trenchcoats, these characters look as real as they can. That's important, too, because they need to compete against the real thing in live-action cut scenes.For the most part, the character animations are cool. That is, when they are kicking butt. When just moving through the environment, they look a little stiff (and the fence crawling is atrocious). Although the walking animation is nice, the running scheme is a tad laughable. Why are these people always sprinting T2 style everywhere?The biggest problem with the graphics, however, is the camera. While it does do some nice things, like pulling out to display a one-on-two fight from the side to incorporate all of the combatants, too often it gets stuck behind objects and walls, and generally struggles to keep up with the action. Any developer will tell you that a good 3D camera is one of the trickiest things to pull off, and it wasn't pulled off here. Part of the problem with the camera is that it is locked on to the character so hardcore. There's only freedom of movement when you're stopped, making looking around difficult indeed.Free look ability seems crucial to certain parts of the game, yet it is nowhere to be found. When you are crouching or taking cover, it would be nice to swing through the room and get a look around. As it stands, you often cannot see even what would be in a character's peripheral vision. A tighter camera would have made for a tighter game. But alas, it feels a little sloppy.At least the effects are top-notch. As in the films, bullets fired while in focus create ripples in the air. In addition, when you hit a target and knock it to the ground, a green burst of code floats into the ether (after the style of binary code that streams down to represent the Matrix). These two effects help to link the game further to the films, and look pretty damn cool, too.The GameCube version also supports 480p (though not widescreen). The game looks incredibly sharp in this mode and the framerate remains at a steady 60fps.SoundOne of the handiest things about having a great movie license like The Matrix is that the game music can be lifted directly from the film. Too often, however, game designers get lazy and don't use music correctly. That isn't the case with Enter the Matrix. All of the dramatic fight music is employed here, and it's almost always applied well. There's something satisfying about kicking ass in slow-motion as the awesome score from the film punctuates the action. The blending of one passage of music to another is handled fairly well throughout as well ,although there are a couple of moments where the music simply stops, then resumes.The aural goodness doesn't end at the score, however. This is a sonically rich game, especially if you have the setup to appreciate it. The sound effects from the film are brilliantly captured here, including the agent-morphing effect, and the Matrix-drizzle effect (for lack of a better term).Special attention has also been paid to getting the gunfire and explosions sounding extra-delicious. There are definite differences between the cadences of the guns. Beyond that, the echoes and ambient noise surrounding the hail of gunfire (bodies being hit, tiles exploding, etc.) sound absolutely amazing.Also quite magnificent is the difference between real-time sound and focus-time sound. The ~underwater~ sound of focus is similar to the sound of bullet-time in the film, and it is a glorious sensation, indeed. The transition between real and focus time is also quite keen. Don't believe me? Then your TV isn't loud enough.Shiny didn't skimp out on GameCube and endowed the GCN version with crystal clear Dolby Pro-Logic II surround sound. No nasty compression and bad midi here.This is the most difficult kind of game to make and review, simply because everyone in the world has preconceived notions of what a Matrix game should be, and can be very disappointed if the game doesn't live up to their lofty or idiosyncratic expectations. Enter the Matrix is a decent game. It's not as good as Dead to Rights, and not as fun as Max Payne. But people want to play it (including me), because it is a game based on the films. The fundamental flaw with this game is that it looks and feels slightly unfinished, from the unpolished textures to the bad camera and sparse level design. The fact that the game had to ship at the same time the film was in theaters was an economic decision, and unfortunately, that compromised some of the quality. It happens all the time. But no one wants it to happen to the game based on movies they love.That said, it's worth a play to see the extra footage and experience the bullet-time and focused hand-to-hand combat. At times the game makes you completely forget its flaws and hone in on the joy of creative carnage.  The first time you pull off a spinning kick off the wall, don't be surprised if a smile creases your lips.  If only the whole game was able to capture the fun inherent in the fight sequences, it would be a true masterpiece.", "date": "May 20, 2003"}
