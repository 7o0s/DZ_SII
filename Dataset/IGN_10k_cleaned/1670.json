That's right, kiddies  it's called ~merchandising.~ Popular shows get the toy deals, and that's where Majesco's Game Boy Color version of Nascar Racers comes in -- it has as much to do with the actual NASCAR racing circuit as Taco Bell has to do with traditional Mexican food. The game itself is an interesting take on the overhead racing genre, but the game moves so darn fast and requires too much blind faith in its controls that its fun is lost after the first few laps. Features Four locations More than 20 tracks Password save Only for Game Boy Color  Get behind the wheel of one of five vehicles in a race through four locations. The object is to come out the winner against three opponents in each of the tracks  earn enough points by coming in first, second or third, and you'll be able to move onto the next round in the circuit. Each vehicle has its own special ability that continuously charges throughout the race  some gain invincibility (handy), while others give the vehicles an extra boost of speed (see below why this is less than convenient).  It's up to you to decide which is the right car for your driving skills.   It's obvious where the inspiration came from -- Spy Hunter. The top-down view, the always-traveling-up driving, and the twisting, splitting tracks are enough to tell that the classic game was this title's overall blueprint. There's even a vehicle similar to the Weapons Van that'll refuel and repair your car as its moving. All the design needs is a hood mounted machine gun and the Peter Gunn theme song and you've got the classic racing shooter. Nascar Racer is a simple design with nice graphics and fast action, but as quaint as it is, it's got its problems...  It's cool that the game moves as fast as it does, but the sheer speed of the scrolling is what hurts the game the most. The track challenges come in the form of obstacles in the middle of the road, from oil slicks to water puddles to random debris, each designed to either slow down the vehicles or stop it completely.  But since the engine moves so darn quickly and you get absolutely no fair warning of what's coming up, it makes it nearly impossible to maneuver around the oncoming items. You'll find yourself annoyingly stuck against the in-road obstacles more often than you can handle, and it's this feature that drains the fun out of the game.  And again, the failure to hide tracks eliminates the incentive to play through the game's circuit mode. We blasted Cruis'n Exotica for having a mode that enables racers to play through any track at any time, and it's the same case with Nascar Racers and its Single Race mode. The game also has a ~Best Time~ function that remembers the fastest laps in the tracks, but without a battery to save them, these numbers are lost in digital limbo when the power shuts off.    This is a nice try to inject an action-based design into a racing license, but when it's implemented, Nascar Racers just doesn't work. It's fast, it's beautiful to look at, and it's got great control...but you have just as much luck avoiding obstacles playing with your eyes closed.", "date": "Dec 20, 2000"}
