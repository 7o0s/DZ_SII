If you like the television show, then the download is an easy decision. If you like trivia games, it's a smart buy. If you have no idea what kind of animal a basilisk is or don't know who participated in the 30 Year War -- and could possibly care less about hazarding a guess -- move on, Jeopardy! 2005 is not going to make you a convert.   Jeopardy! 2005 does offer some advancements over the previous edition. The game board is bigger now -- 15 questions to make you feel bad about skipping high school history class all those times. You can customize your on-screen avatar even more, so creating a ~sorta in the neighborhood~ visage of yourself is possible. New question packs will be available every month to keep the content fresh.   The big differences between Jeopardy! 2005 and the TV show is that the answer format is now multiple choice and Alex Trebek is nowhere to be found. (Pop cult Q: Did you see his mug on ~American idol~ the other night? Dude looked depressed he had to be there to shill for ~Jeopardy.~ Or maybe Ryan Seacrest is smelly. I'd buy either.) Jeopardy! 2005 is a good representation of the enduring game show favorite. Long after ~Millionaire~ has come and gone from the limelight, ~Jeopardy!~ remains fresh. This mobile edition is a great way to take the trivia fun on the road and the updated question packs will keep the game vital. If you like to feel all smart about yourself then you are either my friend's mean ex-girlfriend or you will like Jeopardy! 2005.", "date": "Apr 21, 2005"}
