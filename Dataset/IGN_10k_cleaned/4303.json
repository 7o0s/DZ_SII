And Natsume's definitely answering the plea with Cima: The Enemy, a game that's part RPG, part puzzler, and part realtime strategy game. Unfortunately, it's a game design that doesn't always work, and its extreme shortcomings in player interface makes Cima feel more like a chore than a fun gaming experience. Props to Natsume for trying something different, and some folks might even dig the unique style of gameplay...just be aware that it's not the most streamlined of designs. Features Fourteen different party members Cartridge save (two slots) Cima: The Enemy puts players in control of what's known as a ~Gate Guardian.~ Conveniently, you're on a a train carrying passengers to the uncharted frontier (think the Wild West), and is mysteriously transported to the world of the Cima. CIMA are essentially the world's enemy, vicious creatures that thrive on humanity's ~hope~ for sustenance. 14 people are now trapped in this world with your character to save them. The task for the gamer is to command these members into moving from place to place in the constructed levels, all the while protecting them from Cima attacks by fighting the threat with your increasing weapon and magical abilities. The task is to send units to trigger switches that will extend bridges or pull up switches so that you can get further into the areas.  Though these 14 characters have their own personality and abilities, when it comes to their action on-screen they're incredible mindless drones. They don't do anything unless you actually tell them to do something...they won't budge an inch until you give the command. This gives the game a strong Lemmings influence, but since the game limits the overall view in an isometric perspective it's not the easiest task to keep track of where these people are and what they're doing. The developers try to give players as much control and visual aid as possible with overlaid maps (pulled up with the select button), as well as a menu interface to select individuals in a particular party. But as intuitive as the designers try to lay out these menu systems, they're far more complex than they should be...and really make the game clumsy to play.  Technical limitations also play into the game's clunky feel. There's very little in the way of artificial intelligence. No, scratch that; there isn't any. To get a member of your party to move from one place to the next, you absolutely have to make sure there's no corners in the way, because the game will not adjust their path to take into account a wall, pillar, or gap. These guys will simply get stuck and walk in place until you tell them to alter their course. And since the engine can only handle so many moving sprites on-screen, the game groups the characters together in bunches of four, and it's just a sloppy effort to change from one group to the next.  As quirky as the game's implementations are, there are a lot of levels and challenge to Cima: The Enemy, and if you can manage through all of the interface and technical problems there's a decent story and solid game length. But there's more problems here weighing the game down, so keep that in mind if you're ready to make the plunge into something different on the GBA. I'll definitely give Natsume credit for not only releasing a new game franchise in a market where only namebrands succeed, but for also producing a game design that's distinctly different.  It's definitely something unique for the GBA, but that element alone can't really carry the design. The implementation feels extremely cluttered and clunky and requires an incredible amount of micromanaging during gameplay; some people might find this aspect the game's real charm. And though Natsume's proven that work can be fun with its successful Harvest Moon brand, Cima just feels like work.", "date": "Dec 6, 2003"}
