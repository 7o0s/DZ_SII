It seems like these days just about every sports oriented game is packing serious sonic heat in the form of hit singles, known musical entities, and up-and-coming hopefuls. True to form, however, many of these soundtracks fall short of the mark of being the kind of compilation of tunes you'd want bumping on your iPod or compiled onto a CD available for purchase at your local record store. Given the lackluster track record of many videogame soundtrack tie-ins, it would be normal to assume that the accompanying CD for NBA 2K6 would also fall into the whirlpool of mediocrity. Guess what? Such assumptions would make asses out of a whole lotta folks. Seriously.   Packed with bristling brickyard oriented jams, the CD for 2K6 Basketball trims the in-games list from 30-odd down to 14 streamlined efforts from a wide variety of heads, quite a few of whom are known quantities within mainstream circles, while the balance is kept by an equal number of underground superstar inclusions. Names like The Roots, Common, and Redman will appeal to the above ground players while the likes of Aesop Rock, Jean Grae, and RJD2 focus on the cellar dweller crowd.   The aforementioned RJD2, one of the best examples of a cinematically inclined beatmeister to emerge from the dark side of the tarmac, bookends the album with a pairing called ~Schoolyard Scrimmage,~ which is served up in both ~Intro~ and ~Outro~ modes. His deft aural concoctions set the stage for the first bona fide rap track on the effort, one ~Big Money Talk~ by Bay Area stalwart Lyrics Born. Over a turgid electrified grind LB drops his patented twang sneer in a braggadocio swirl. Then it's straight to the other coast for a little Doctor recommended mayhem courtesy of Redman on ~That's Why I'm Here.~ Dropping asides to Lethal Weapon, marijuana, and some of that rugged stream-of-consciousness bugaboo he is so skilled at, Red kicks up some serious dust. But then would you expect any less?   Gift of Gab and Chief Xcel keep the bragging rights on tilt with the horn infested and drum packed ~Excellent.~ The repeated snippets of a voice extolling ~excellent~ insure that you don't forget the name of the track or how Blacka come. Little Brother keep the indie crew element strong with ~Carolina Agents,~ a smoothed out blacksploitation-styled bit of sonic slickness laying the musical bed over which Phonte and Big Pooh get busy.   While most of the tracks are solid, two in specific stand out as world class burners and serve as linchpins to the album as a whole. ~Set 'Em On Fire~ by The Roots is an Old School king-of-rock-meets-chugging PoMo electronic clash-styled fist waver that stomps and rails with bombastic verve. But perhaps the bangingest inclusion here comes from underground kingpin Aesop Rock. His entry, ~Junkyard~ is simply brilliant, both in terms of beat composition and linguistic amplitude. A lurching groove comprised of thundering bass, swirling guitars, and some I Dream Of Genie-styled orchestral flushes creates a massively intoxicating musical backdrop over which 'Sop gets seriously bugged. ~Dumb it down for none/for none dumber/the Dumb Out Posse is off Broadway for the summer/bummer/and still it's innerlockness/glock fresh and a fistful of missiles/rock bells no bells and whistles/shell-shocked with a flock of hell's wolves and minstrels/shell-toed ghosts on the style to signals/grassroots ghoul though it's kept and simple/pour the water in a nerd and them observe the impulse~ The resume of b-boyisms and pause tapes that Aesop brings is from some nether world where William S. Burroughs and John Cage seem to be the obvious points of lyrical and compositional inspiration. Brilliant.    The rest of the album is teeming with a varied array of samplings that will soothe just about any real hip-hop soul. From the languid swerve of Aceyalone on ~Doin' My Job~ over a faux horn inflected bump to the exotic bounce of ~Throw It In Ya Grill~ by the Hieroglyphics crew (this track features the wonderful chorus refrain of ~A little bit of this is all I need/Can't wait to get home and smoke somesalmon!~ Common gets busy over a Melvin Bliss-inspired drum break for the bristling ~The Movement.~ Zion I deliver the melancholy violin infused ~Ride.~ Even though Zion rips it with lickety split delivery, the mournful waft of the strings give the track an overriding sadness. Skillz brings up the rear of the album with the shuffling title track (~2K6~) which revels in simplistic beat attitude (a mutated keyboard croak and sync drum track).   Interestingly enough, despite the male dominated stance of the album, one of the genre's best femme fatale MCs ever, Jean Grae, represents lovely for the ladies of rap with the bubbling electronic sci-fi embellishment and swirling synth blissness that coats ~The Jam.~ Grae delivers her trademarked silky-yet-commanding flow bouncing off the sweet laced ~da-da-da-da's~ on the chorus and the chicka-chicka guitar flourishes that drift through the backdrop. Nice.   Taken individually every single track on this album is pretty damn sizzling. However, the way the disc has been transitioned is a bit sluggish, some of the tracks feeling a bit out of place given their BPM makeup. To wit, many of the more down-tempo tracks find themselves sandwiched between more banger/fist waving oriented numbers. It provides for a sometimes lurching ride through the b-ball inspired madness of it all. Yet such is a small quibble for an album that by its very design probably shouldn't have been as solid as it is. Nitpicking aside, the folks at 2K Sports deserve serious kudos for actually stepping to the paint and compiling a more or less top-notch musical accompaniment to the latest installment of their basketball videogame franchise.
