The name may not be familiar here in the States, but they're popular back in the Land of the Rising Sun, good ol' Japan. Now, I don't mean that this is risky for Konami since there's already an installed fan base to count on, but risky for the gamer since Konami could be counting on the same fan base. Just look at Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines for a particularly scary (and grating, and painful) example. Cy Girls still has enough going for it, but overall it's a pleasant way to use the license and ride the toy association.   Gameplay  Even though there are some good ideas and some good play mechanics to work with here, Cy Girls definitely takes plenty of shortcuts to deliver the goods. The game is split into two discs, one for each of the two characters, Ice and Aska. Ice is blond, likes to show off her cleavage, and has a thing for guns. Aska is Japanese, loves fishnet stockings, and favors the sharp blade of her sword. Both Ice and Aska have their own stories and own ways of fighting, but they do tend to share some of the same levels, albeit with different goals. While reusing some levels is not such a big sin in and of itself, it's the general pacing of the game that makes this fact tedious.   Cy Girls is split in half in more ways than just having two characters, there's also two distinct elements of the gameplay: the action and the puzzling. The action is clearly where the game is on more comfortable ground. Ice and Aska get their guns and swords as well as grenades and throwing stars (for Aska only) to change the pace a little. Ice is the more interesting of the two in terms of combat. She can lock onto a character and keep shooting as she's jumping forward or backwards. One of her best tricks is to jump forward and slide on the ground, shooting the whole time. It may not be the most useful thing, but it adds a little bit of style that makes the game more fun to watch.   Another fun element for the style-o-meter is the wall-hugging that both Ice and Aska can do. By crouching behind a short wall or leaning against a wall next to a corner, both can remain hidden and then pop out for a quick attack. Aska is even more down with the wall action since she can run along them to clear gaps or just for the hell of it.    To keep the slickness going, Aska has some flashy moves herself with some fatal blows. Using her sword, Aska can do a jumping attack as well as a double, triple, or quintuple attack. The only drawback is that these moves are not controllable by the player. The jump attack is merely a matter of hitting the jump and attack buttons right after each other. The multiple attacks are even easier, all that's needed is to be in the right place and to hit the attack button.   To make up for the fact that with these stylish, but easy, moves, Cy Girls throws in plenty of enemies to take on. In a bit of a baffling gameplay decision, enemies tend to respawn if you leave a room for too long. This gives you more opportunities to slice, dice, and shoot, but it makes the game more repetitive than it needs to be. The enemies provide enough of a challenge the first time that fighting them again doesn't do much more than to make the game become repetitive. This gets even worse when I was running around the levels to solve the many puzzles in the game.   When Cy Girls tries to get funky with the puzzles, it's not a pretty sight. Many of the puzzles involve a lot of backtracking across large levels. It gets incredibly tedious to keep getting objectives that require you to go all the way across a level, hit a switch, go all the way back, get the card, do a lap around an entire castle to break an obscure section of a wall, etc. The game generally breaks down into fetch quest after fetch quest. This is made more difficult by the fact that it's often difficult to figure out just what the missions are.      In one mission, I needed to collect all of the chips from little cleaning robots all over the level. I was given a remote control and told that I could use it to get one to come closer if I heard it nearby. After running around and not finding nearly enough, I finally figured out that I could use the remote to find hidden robots and get them to come out of hiding. After this, it was a matter of running around the entire level and tapping the remote button constantly. Even inside rooms I still needed to run around the entire perimeter to get the robots to come out. Figuring out what to do is more often luck and persistence than truly discovering a clever solution.   To give the puzzles more depth, there's the virtual world that puts the 'cy' (ber) in Cy Girls. Both of the girls are hackers and drop themselves into a virtual reality version of their real surroundings. The enemies are programs that float, walk, or roll around and protect the online information. With floatier physics, both girls can do more aerial tricks than in real life and can user cyber moves to break walls, hack into conversations, and download the information they need to uncover a global conspiracy.    While this provides another avenue for puzzles, the vision of cyberspace feels very outdated with ideas of avatars and hacking that have been around for the past 20 years. With so much science fiction and movies (like, say, The Matrix) covering the same ground in a more fleshed out and lived-in way, Cy Girls presents an outdated vision.   I love puzzles in games, but the puzzles in Cy Girls felt less than inspired and more often a ripoff from other games. Like a mirror and light beam challenge or pulling a switch and running for a closing door, several puzzles were taken straight from the Tomb Raider series. Sometimes, the puzzles just don't make any sense at all. I ran around a virtual room for an hour before I decided to kill every avatar and program that I could find. Only by killing a guard program flying near the ceiling did a crystal appear to unlock the door I needed.    If Cy Girls had streamlined the puzzles, livened up the action with more control, and made the virtual world look less like TRON, it might've had something special. As it is, there are plenty of parts that have a few interesting ideas, but don't work well with each other and take the overall experience down.    Graphics  The graphics are smooth and uncomplicated with a fast framerate and simple environments. One of the nicest tricks is the use of focus for objects in the distance. The distance often gets blurred out as if it were out of focus and gives the game a feeling of depth.    If there was one word that could describe the look, it would be ~slick.~ The models aren't complicated, but the movement is solid and there is a somewhat unique feel going on. The enemy humans appear with a wireframe first and then a solid body. They can also die by becoming wireframe models again as well. The graphics are short on eye candy and detail, but at least it runs well.   Sound  Just when you thought it was safe to turn up the volume, the voice acting in Cy Girls convinces you otherwise. The voice acting here is so bad that it's gone past bad, through bad-good, and on through to bad again. The music holds up the backend nicely and the sound effects are appropriate enough, but, man, that acting is horrible.  Cy Girls gets some credit for having some stylish elements, two adventures, and plenty of puzzles to work through, that's for sure. The big problems are the cut and paste nature of the gameplay, the endless backtracking and the long, tedious puzzles. The virtual world is an interesting addition, but even that looks so simple that the movie The Lawnmower Man still looks like a vision of the virtual future. If you're a fan of working through confusing situations that take a while to get through, Cy Girls is the game for you.", "date": "Mar 24, 2004"}
