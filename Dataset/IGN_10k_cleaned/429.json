High on success and chalk fumes, I was ready to make a killing of my entire error-ridden junior high, using my dictionary filled mouth as my one and only weapon. Then we got to the competition, and I had to stand with 20 or 30 other big spellers from around the school in front of an auditorium of parents, each of which was either cheering or leering their children to the winner's circle. The pressure was horrible, and all I could think about was how horribly long this whole wretched event was going to take before I got my post-bee ice cream.  I lost on the first word -- recess -- and ran happily from the stage, ate my ice cream cone, and remembered why I hate competition. I hate competing (unless I can win, of course), but for some people, it's their backbone -- take the Beatles. Would Lennon and McCartney have crafted such brilliant songs if they didn't have each other's talent to compare themselves to? This goes for gaming, too -- a great many games have been made off of one title's success. We wouldn't have the incredible Revenant if it wasn't for Diablo, and we wouldn't have Sim Theme Park if it wasn't for the incredible success of Theme Park and Roller Coaster Tycoon. All I can say is, thank god for competition.  There's no doubt that Roller Coaster Tycoon wouldn't exist if it wasn't for Theme Park's ideas and personality. But RCT added a level of detail and complexity that the TP had only hinted at, as well as turning the construction of roller coasters into a complete game in of itself. And let's not mention the mutual nod to Sim City. The greatest surprise about all this influence? Each title stands strongly on its own feet, and feel more like cousins than battling siblings, with each title offering strong points that make each unique.  Like Theme Park and Roller Coaster Tycoon, the goal here is to build a fun, successful amusement park that balances bringing in the customers and raking in the profits. You're in control of everything  where to build the trash cans, what kind of stores to open (and the quality and price of the products that the stores carry), what rides to build, what trees, paths, entertainers, janitors... you get the picture. What really separates this game from its predecessors is big, big 3D. You can zoom in, turn, and touch nearly every object in the game, as well as take over any of the park-goers and see things through their eyes. It's as big as it sounds, and the Bullfrog team really implements it well (one gripe though: you can't fly the camera through the environment freely, but I think the team has done it solely to keep frame rates up). Add to that some extensive online features, and you've got the all new Theme Park.  You begin the game with two Themes (Halloween and Lost World) and you can add two more (Wonderland and Space) by gaining golden keys, which in turn can be gained by getting golden tickets. The structure in STP is fairly loose, allowing you to construct to your heart's content -- but achieve certain hidden goals, like getting a certain number of visitors in a month , and you'll receive a golden ticket, as well as some bonus cash. You'll also get challenges, which range from selling a certain amount of balloons in a month to keeping your bathrooms clean for 90 days, which can also award you cash prizes, as well as golden tickets. Get enough tickets, and you'll gain a key. Keys not only open up new sections of the park, but they give you access to special rides as well. And what rides there are in STP...  The rides are really the game's strongest point, not only inventive in design, but hand-in-hand with the overall graphic quality of the game. Each world has a unique set of rides with a hand-crafted look, and animations that will keep you watching long after you've built them. It's fun to see the different transformations of similar rides depending on the theme you're playing in, such as the Kart rides or the coasters, which can appear as a bat-coaster on the Halloween level, or a bunch of bugs riding on vines in Wonderland. You don't just construct a ride, you plant it, watching it pop up from the ground and sprout parts until it becomes a full-fledged ride. And its not just the rides that catch your eye -- even the trash cans have personalities of their own (particularly the slime-monster garbage eater in the Halloween World).  Though the music is very background-worthy, the sound effects give you all the thrills of a real theme park, without being overwhelming, due to the regional sound tricks that the designers have implemented into the game. Pass over the arcade, and you'll hear the sounds of video games echoing -- zoom in, and they get even louder. It keeps the noise from becoming a racket, but gives you all the buzzes, whistles and bangs that you need and deserve out of clanging metal and crunching fast food.  But what about the coasters? Sim Theme Park's entry into the coaster construction arena is a joyous, point-and-click experience that takes out strenous brainwork, and replaces it with instant action. Constructing rides is as simple as setting pylons, and watching the ride connect itself. Don't like where a pylon is? Simple click on it, and move it to the next available space. You can also raise, lower, tilt and twist pylons with a mouse click, which is a breeze compared to RCT's precise building structure. What you don't get, however, is the detailed physics of RCT's coaster construction. Coasters, for the most part, seem to magically be able to hit any loop or hill, no matter what the height of the drop. I didn't mind  STP's simplification of the building process  -- in fact, I loved that I could get a coaster up and running in a matter of seconds, and tweak it without the misery that you'd have to face in RCT when trying to modify an existing ride. What this means, though, is that you can construct a coaster that might actually have to crawl through loops and strain around corners to finish its circuit. I would have liked a bit more realistic physics, but I can definitely understand their choices.   Being able to walk around your park in first-person view really fills that void that all Sim-games have  the personal experience. I can't tell you how many amazing (to me, anyway) roller coasters I've built in RCT only to feel sad that I couldn't actually ride them. Though you won't be able to construct the physics-heavy beasts of RCT, you can still come up with some pretty crazy creations, propelled by the fact that you'll be able to take front car in the coaster once you've finished your handiwork. Even being able to bounce around on the bloody Brain with the other kids in Halloween world was nice -- no matter how exciting, dull, inventive or plain the ride is, the fact that you can touch it that makes the game so unique.  One of the most unexpected additions in Sim Theme Park is the extensive online component to the game -- in a very Hasbro-ish move, the designers have made some cool innovations in order to keep a community alive surrounding STP in the months to come. Grab a user name and password from the official website, and you can email your screenshot ~postcards~ to friends, or browse a world map and take a look at some of the best parks online. I rode someone else's insane coaster in Hong Kong, and took a ride in the Lost World theme in the ambiguously named Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Not only can you take a look at their park, but you can chat with other browsers online, as well as keep an address book of your favorite buddies. Vote on your favorite parks, and if you think you've made a good enough creation, publish your own park on the web. Like everything else in the game, it's simple to use, and nearly seamless in its integration.  All of this is just frosting over the actual gameplay, however, and when it comes down to actually running the park, you may find yourself wishing for a little more control over the nitty gritty. You can take out loans, buy more land, check out your finances, and all that other fantastic Sim craziness, but in reality you'll be spending a good amount of time watching over your employees, setting their patrol routes, and wondering why you've hired 800 janitors for the park, and it's still dirty. Though I loved keeping track of pranksters and vomit-ridden exit lines, I wish that you could do more tweaking on the rides themselves. You can set the prices and quality of the food, and the speed and size of the rides, but they didn't seem to have the drastic effects on the park as a whole as they would with most Sim games. Add to this the hidden gold ticket goals (you don't actually know how to get your gold tickets -- for the most part, you win them after you've done something) and the simpler park maintenance structure, and you find yourself with an entertaining, but at times slow moving, Sim experience.  The bottom line is that if you're looking for a detailed simulation, you might find yourself wanting -- but in terms of fun factor, STP scores, and scores high. The tutorial almost hand holds you through the construction process without ever making the game feel dull, and the amount of buildable rides and features are sure to keep you entertained for a quite a while.  Sim Theme Park isn't as complex as Roller Coaster Tycoon, and definitely won't tax your micro-management skills to the extent that RCT does  but is that such a bad thing? The best thing about both games is that they really aren't all that similar to one another, once you get down to the gameplay. Sim Theme Park is faster, brighter, and a more wow-heavy experience, while RCT gives you the change to really control your park down to the details, while giving you a harder set of tasks, and a larger set of goals than STP. The most surprising thing I found while playing Sim Theme Park was that you could play both games without ever having to truly feel like you were re-creating a similar experience.   -- Vincent Lopez  Note: A sign of general big biginess -- EA owns Maxis and Bullfrog, which means when it came time to actually ship Theme Park World, they decided to put it under the ~Sim~ line, despite the fact that it was a completely different developer. So there ya go.   Sim Theme Park is a fantastic game, if a little flawed in execution. The depth of play is a veritable smorgasbord of detail for all you control freaks out there. If you can sidestep the slightly marred graphic presentation in the 2D view, you will find what boils down to one of the best ways to kill a couple of hours without you even knowing about it.", "date": "Nov 20, 1999"}
