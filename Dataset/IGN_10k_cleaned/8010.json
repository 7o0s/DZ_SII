{"name": "Pokemon Stadium 2 [Japanese Version]", "name_review": "Pokemon Stadium 2 (Import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/05/04/pokemon-stadium-2-import", "text": "If you're confused by the numbers, let's clear it all up right here and now:  Pokemon Stadium was released in August 1998 in Japan. It was a limited game that only featured half of the 151 Game Boy creatures. It shipped with the 64GB Pak (Transfer Pak) packed in.  Then Nintendo released a much better version of the game in April 1999, called Pokemon Stadium 2. The ~2~ in the title is a bit misleading, as it's actually just an expanded version of the original. PokeSta 2 features ALL 151 Pokemon, mini-games and more.  In March 2000, Nintendo finally released Pokemon Stadium in the US. Although the game is just called Pokemon Stadium, it is actually an enhanced version of the Japanese Pokemon Stadium 2. Nintendo added a Gallery mode, Pikachu voices and changed around the tournaments in the Stadium Mode.  Apart from these minor details the two games are the same. The only reason why you would buy the import is that the Japanese Game Boy games won't work with the US Pokemon Stadium. We have reviewed the US version of Pokemon Stadium in full, so be sure to follow this link for the full lowdown.If you are a fan of Pokemon, this game's likely been on your radar for quite some time now. In almost all areas, it doesn't disappoint. In a lot of ways, it's superior to its predecessor, as there is a good deal more challenge and other valuable things to do. The Pokemon Academy section of the game was brilliant, and the mini-games are a lot more fun. What it boils down to is this:  Did you play through Gold or Silver? Did you enjoy battling? If so, you will love this game. If you did not, pass. While Pokemon Stadium 2 does a lot of things, it is basically a repetitive, turn-based fighting game. And if you're not into that, stay away. Otherwise, grab your Pokemon and let's scrap.", "date": "May 4, 1999"}
