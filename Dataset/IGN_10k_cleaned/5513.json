One audience which Sorrent definitely has in mind is the casual gamer, and there really are few games more casual than Simon. Based on the classic electronic matching game from Hasbro, Simon might actually even be too casual for its own good.   This is Simon alright. The four-color module is represented faithfully on-screen (although, you can customize the module with different sound effects and skins) and you must press the thumbpad (or number keys) in the direction of the sound/light played during the computer's turn. Match the pattern correctly and you go on to the next round. Blow a string of combos and it's game over.   Simon does have a few different game modes, such as a real aggro challenge where you have to link dozens of combos together, but all in all, this is just regular Simon. And it's just not the most compelling mobile game out there -- it's pretty shallow, in fact. Why not try something really different, like a multiplayer game where one player devises the string od colors while the other matches? And maybe make it online?   Also working against Simon is the fact that the pad just cannot seem to keep up with your speed. In order to keep the combos in memory, most players jam on the combo as fast as possible, lest they forget. You actually have to pace yourself with this version as it will not register really fast inputs.  Simon is the perfect mobile game -- for 1999. Seriously, this rivals Snake in depth. Sorrent is smart to seek out casual gamers -- not everybody wants to play Kingdom of Heaven -- but the firm certainly has better casual titles on the horizon, such as Zuma and Daily Puzzle. I suggest you pass on this one and wait for either of those upcoming games.", "date": "Feb 22, 2005"}
