Nin- persevere + ja person] (1975): A person trained in ancient Japanese martial arts and employed especially for espionage and assassinations. (Merriam Webster tenth edition)   Is Ninja really a ninja game? No. But Eidos' and Core's newest and long-hyped action game, Ninja: Shadow of Darkness, takes players on a long journey into a full 3D environment filled with enemies, bosses, and key-based puzzles.   The polygonal, texture-based game situates you as a purple-suited ninja whose mission is to defeat the evil forces that have taken over the land. The story starts with two great warriors, each with massive forces, who have agreed to create peace throughout the land in the pastoral east. One, however, isn't as satisfied with the agreement. He trades his soul to a dark demon who blankets the countryside at night with a nearly-insurmountable force that kills civilians and innocents alike  whomever stands in its way. A lone warrior trained in the ancient Japanese arts takes it upon himself to set things straight.   The premise of Ninja, however, isn't necessarily in synch with the style of action in the game. Nothing in this game defends the blatantly un-ninja style of fighting, anti-stealthy action, and complete lack of espionage and assassination. Subtle is not a word we would use to describe Ninja.  Despite these facts, Ninja is a solid if uninspired action game that is tricky in parts and presents a consistent challenge. Your man is capable of kicks, punches, lots of combination moves, and an unlimited arsenal of card-like projectiles (I wish I could say they look like Shuriken, but they don't) that resemble credit cards. As he moves throughout the game he picks up even more abilities and power-ups, including swords and the like, as well as bombs, magic, and a kick-butt spinning power move.  A list of bosses that resemble hybrid gargoyles and humanoid serpents pepper the missions, and grow increasingly tough to defeat near the game's end. Luckily, your growing list of power-ups enables you to match the bosses' powers as you progress.  Ninja, as you may have guessed by now, is a single-player game, that does not take advantage of the dual shock nor does it use the analog controller. These two features it could well have used, seeing as how ~ninja~ moves in full 3D (technically, he can only move in eight directions), and power blasts or hits from enemies could have enhanced the game's generic feel.Ninja tops even Jersey Devil for the bland, generic game of the year award (and strangely enough, there was a lot of purple in that game, too). It appears to have been created by a bunch of faceless executives who wanted an action-based game that was somehow Japanese, and that in some way used a ninja to beat up other bad guys, including even...other ninjas, evil ninjas. ~Well, um, let's see, what should we call it?~ wondered one executive. ~The great Purple One~...~Japanese Warrior~...Streets of Rag...nope that's taken.~...~Double Drag...uh, uh. No this is 3D!...and that's taken, too.~ The conversation could have gone on for days, until possibly, they agreed upon a fantastic solution. They sent all of the creative folks out of the room, and planned their strategy. ~Let's call it...Ninja! That hits all of the marks! We can't miss with that!~ Of course, this is a hypothetical conversation. But the point is that Ninja could have been called Cowboy Man or Fighter Dude or Street Warrior, or One Tough Cop (Ooops! That's taken, too) because the amount of ~ninja~ action in it is nil. There is no stealth; none. You don't sneak around in the shadows at all. In fact, you can't even get into the shadows if you tried; the game won't allow you to. Espionage? Zip. Assassinations? Balderdash. They aren't there. Ninja is a classic beat-'em-up in 3D with no traits whatsoever of a single ninja. In fact, I'm sure most real-life ninjas would not endorse this product for all of the shurikens in the world.Despite its inappropriate name (what do you think about ~Wham! 3D Action!~?), Ninja is semi-fun game with enough mid-wit puzzles and constant action that ~casual~ and ~player~-type gamers will like it. Hard-core gamers will zoom straight onto Tenchu for more realistic ~ninja-istic~ gameplay. You can pull off some cool combinations and you can fling cards about like there is no tomorrow (not unlike a certain X-Man named Gambit).It's also not an easy game, either. Ninja will challenge your skills until the very end, and cause you a certain relief when you're all done with it. Like you've finished an exam (on how to name a videogame properly), or you've just fixed your (purple) car. In the end, Ninja is not terrible. It's a middle-of-the-road game that'll keep your fingers busy until the pizza arrives on a rainy night, and you've got nothing to do (except sneak around in the dark, which is more than ~Ninja~ does).", "date": "Oct 13, 1998"}
