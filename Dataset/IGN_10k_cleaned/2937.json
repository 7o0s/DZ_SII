The idea that Sony's one-time premiere mascot could grace a competing console seemed impossible. But as the years have passed we've learned that in this industry only one thing is certain: change.  So here we are, writing a GameCube review for Universal Interactive's Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex. The title, developed originally by Traveller's Tales and ported by Eurocom Entertainment, arrives nearly identical to the already-released PS2 original complete with very little in the way of technical improvements. In the end it's a fun, formulaic 3D platformer, but unlike the industry itself the game has changed very little from the first Crash title on Sony's last console, which dates the experience considerably, especially compared to Nintendo's current cream of the crop.  The Facts  Classic Crash play style updated for next-generation consoles More than 30 new levels including a volcanic island, a Japanese village, an African jungle and more New vehicular play styles: control a jeep, fly a hang glider, pilot a mech and more Play as Crash's sister, Coco PS2 port Single-player game   Gameplay Meet Dr. Neo Cortex: square-headed with tuffs of hair on the sides, clearly insane, and filled with a hate for Crash Bandicoot. The character, always the nemesis of the Naughty Dog designed series, has a giant 'N' tattooed on this forehead, a detail that may or may not have symbolized something more than his name at one time. Cortex, over the course of several Crash adventures, has grown weary of consistently falling to the Bandicoot's heroic wins. So he creates a super being to oppose Crash, and fools with the Elemental Powers, erupting a destructive force unto the planet which scatters a series of crystals all around it. It's up to you to find these crystals, right the elemental balance and restore order to the Earth. So there's that: the textbook story for every platform game.  Indeed, Wrath of Cortex can be summed up as textbook. It follows -- no, closely guards itself to all the guidelines of platform games and rarely strays from the formula. So you get the basics. Crash can walk, run, sneak, slide, jump, and spin about, all with a tight sense of control familiar to everyone who's played the previous projects. It's runs in 3D, but you won't find the wide-open, go-anywhere worlds you've jetted through in Super Mario Sunshine. Instead, the levels are confined to a set path; Crash can run forward in some stages, toward the camera in others, and to the side in others still. In these types of levels, which make up the majority of the game, the goals are as simple as the play style: make it to the end, avoid hazards like gaps in the ground, enemy characters, spin and break open boxes, jump into boxes, and collect fruit and items. The challenge of the areas, especially in the first several worlds, isn't difficult, but there is still some tangible measure of satisfaction gained by collecting and completing stages, which we'll chock up to solid design. Stages are likewise well paced and varied, a combination that flows the platformer along smoothly.  There are additions and standouts. Crash can use a number of vehicles through the adventure and these moments arrive as welcome breaks from the been-there-and-done-that general stages. The first time we piloted the hero through an underwater level inside a mini-submarine, for instance, was very entertaining. There are similarly stages where the Bandicoot must fly through the air in dogfights, or use a mech to destroy the area around him, which are also fun in their own right.   Seasoned platformer fans, however, are still likely to find Crash's latest entry a little too simplistic, formulaic or lacking evolution, especially when compared to some of the more complex, ambitious competing games on the market. The simple truth is that, in our opinion, Pac-Man World 2 is a more enjoyable product, and Super Mario Sunshine is in a different league entirely. Does that mean Wrath is Cortex is bad? Not at all. But don't expect a classic.  Graphics Crash's latest pulls out all of the stops. Well, on Xbox, anyway. The GameCube version is another story. The title is brought to life with rich, colorful 3D worlds, the texture work is varied, but lacking in detail, and the geometry level is passable. The design of Crash is, as always, in top form, as the character retains his humorous edge complete with wacky, over-the-top animations, which are still welcomed. The particle effects in place are well done and add another level of mood to the environments, which are already spruced up with reflections, marginal lighting effects and more. There is some filtering in place, too, with effects such as heat distortions near lava, a nice touch.  The Wrath of Cortex on GameCube  On the other hand, the presentation is decidedly sterile in nature. The worlds lack roundness, there isn't a whole lot to draw in the first place and yet in some spots the architecture feels empty. Meanwhile, the framerate in the GCN version suffers, a regrettable fact that is hard to overlook given that the title is by no means pushing the boundaries of what GameCube is capable of from a graphic standpoint.   Also, for one reason or another it lacks many of the visual upgrades of the Microsoft version, which includes some fur-shading, upped lighting effects, and runs in progressive scan, for starters.   Sound The primitive congo, jungle-like music of the Crash series returns once more for the GameCube update and it generally gets the job done. The music is well composed and catchy, with enough variation to keep you tapping your feet without realizing it. Some of the worlds feature new music themes that match the style of the level, too, which is refreshing. On the sound effects side, a mixture of voice acting and weird sounds gets the job done, but not triumphantly. The cut-scenes in particular are overdone and some of the characters come off more as annoying than anything else. Still, this sort of thing is almost to be expected from a cartoony platformer type, so we'll forgive it. The lack of Dolby Pro Logic II support hurts more, but perhaps it'll arrive for the sequel.The original Crash Bandicoot was a fun 3D platformer when it first debuted on Sony's PlayStation in this latest update is also enjoyable. Crash plays and looks the same, but he's got new worlds to explore, new vehicles to ride around in and more bosses to battle. Control is as tight as ever and the variation is commendable. But at the end of the day this is the same Crash game I played so many years ago without any real innovations or evolutions. In comparison to what's out there now, specifically games like Conker's Bad Fur Day, Super Mario Sunshine and Sly Cooper, Crash feels downright ancient in comparison.There is another major consideration: he GameCube version sadly suffers from many technical shortcomings not present in the Xbox update. If you have both systems, go with the Microsoft version as it's the truly polished one. Recommended to platform junkies as a decent buy, and as a rental to everyone else. Those expecting a Crash-ized version of Mario Sunshine are in for a big disappointment though as there is really nothing new to see here.", "date": "Sep 17, 2002"}
