Some will love it, some will detest it, and some will be like me, flip-flopping between nostalgic fondness and a very contemporary hatred of things like bottomless pits, linear levels, continuous waves of repeating enemies, and all the other hallmarks of classic action games.  This is one of those games that almost makes me want to seek the aid of Gogg again, in order to present some kind of objective judgment on top of all the fence-sitting.  For all the modern flash exhibited by its cutscenes and magical attacks, this is very definitely a relic of the old school, and players should go into Shinobi expecting all the things that nostalgia usually makes you forget.  Things like frustration, repetition, and falling into bottomless pits just inches away from the end of a stage, which boots you all the way back to the beginning.  As a reward for your suffering, you'll see and experience some pretty cool stuff, but make no mistake, you will suffer.  Gameplay Though its presentation is entirely 3D, Shinobi's level designs remain not very far removed from the series' side-scrolling roots.  Though some open areas are present, they're relatively infrequent in comparison to long stretches of straight, narrow corridors.  It's odd to compare the limited environments to the amount of options available for navigating them -- ninja hero Hotsuma has all the mobility the third dimension grants him and then some.  Shinobi builds on the old dash and double-jump with 3D wall-running, wall jumps, and a speedy stealth dash maneuver.  The stealth dash descends from classic ninja-movie cliches (when I asked director Noriyoshi Ohba where he got the idea, he replied with a look that expressed considerable amazement at Western ignorance).  Tap the X button along with a direction and zap, Hotsuma suddenly jumps from point A to point B, leaving a spectral double where he originally stood.  This is a vital evasion tactic in combat -- the deft of thumb can instantly put themselves in a position to strike from behind, which does far more damage to enemies and breaks through almost any defenses.  This works better than the similar evasion maneuvers in something like Z.O.E, because it still requires skill to apply correctly.  Using the game's lock-on feature to take out enemies one at a time works for a little while, but when there are five or six or more bad guys closing in, you'll be chopped to hash unless you can freely move around them and take out multiple enemies at once.  Other wrinkles add further depth to combat -- paralyzing shuriken become a vital assist, and the cursed sword Akujiki is a nifty idea.  After a certain point, Hotsuma's sword develops the power to suck the life (or yang energy, or something like that) from fallen opponents.  Keep its energy full and it deals more damage in battle, and as a further encouragement, it actually saps Hosuma's life if he doesn't keep killing at a rapid pace.  Hotsuma, in sum, has plenty to do, but the game falls down a bit when presenting opponents for him to do it to.  As I say, the levels are very linear, and tend to present an awful lot of similar enemies, variations on the theme of zombie ninjas.  The first couple of levels has the easy zombie ninjas, the next level or two has the zombie ninjas that block your attacks now and then, and so on.  Even the zombie ninja dogs and the zombie ninja main battle tanks don't present much of a different challenge.  What's more aggravating is that the game has a few good ideas, but doesn't use them nearly enough.  For example, on odd occasions you'll meet a bad guy that climbs on the walls, attacking from there.  That's a great idea, taking advantage of the 3D backgrounds, so why don't they appear more often?  Why not build on that concept?  Give me insane wall-hopping ceiling-crawling spider-ninjas, not ordinary run-around-listlessly-until-they-die ninjas.  Ditto the flying demon-things, who curiously make almost no use of their ability to move in three dimensions.  Shinobi's boss encounters are easily its strongest suit, since that's where the game loosens up a bit and offers more varied patterns.  Early bosses aren't balanced very well -- they're very difficult to take out with basic attacks, and yet sacrifice as much as three-quarters of their energy to a single ninja magic attack -- but later designs are gorgeous to look at and a hell of a good time to fight.  When you're going at it with the giant magic zombie ninja death spider, you know you're having fun.  Boss battles are also the only area of the game which will let you continue from the same point after dying, a curious manifestation of compassion on the part of the designers.  Outside of combat, this is one mean bastard of a platformer.  Shinobi is rife with bottomless pits, and avoiding them requires extremely careful manipulation of the double-jump and wall-jump maneuvers.  Using the wall-run is the only situation where the camera becomes just a bit of a problem, because the default angles sometimes make it difficult to see where you'll land when jumping perpendicular to a wall.  The right analog stick gives nearly complete control over the camera on both axes, though, so it just takes a little forethought to plan a jump.  Pulling it off is another matter, unfortunately -- distances are long, and timing must be perfect.      This would be a little less of a problem if the game had a more forgiving continue system.  The stages are broken up into pieces like the old games -- 2-1, 2-2, 3-1, and so on -- but each of those pieces is very long, and has no checkpoints to continue from.  Fall into a pit (or otherwise meet Hotsuma's maker, perhaps in one of the savagely crowded battles that pepper the later stages) and it's back to the beginning, which means you lose a substantial investment of time with each death.  Death in turn can come quickly and often, and controller-breaking frustration usually follows not too far behind.  Shinobi is still a deft and generally well-designed challenge for the reflexes, and includes some great rewards for dedicated players (I love the hidden Joe Musashi model), but it nevertheless gives the impression that its creators were seeking revenge on their audience.  Perhaps that's at the root of this entire recent retro wave -- games like this and Contra are meant to shut us up, so we spend less time clamoring for revivals of our childhood favorites.  Some gamers will of course not look at it this way.  They'll be pleased someone finally decided to stop going easy on us, and they'll jump on Shinobi in a New York minute.  The rest of us would be advised to give it a test run before committing to the entire adventure.  Graphics Shinobi is powered by a comparatively basic, workmanlike 3D engine, with low polygon counts and somewhat limited lighting, but it's given a leg up by some beautiful artwork.  Hotsuma is a great design, a sort of post-modern evolution of the ninja in comparison to the thoroughly traditional Joe Musashi, and he's surrounded by a host of beautiful demonic concepts.  Even the simplest enemies have a touch of style in their appearance and movements, and I would give a fair bit more than a nickel for a proper printed collection of the game's concept artwork.  If the individual characters have plenty of style, though, they apparently acquired it at the expense of the world around them.  The stage concepts are pretty stale for the most part, and the backgrounds tend to repeat themselves in the same way as the straightforward areas.  Running down hallway after hallway wouldn't be quite so bad if each hallway weren't the same as the last hallway, but unfortunately, they are.  The repeating textures make it even more difficult to find the occasional fork in the road, where bonus items are hidden, because it's so easy to get turned around -- no direction looks different from any other.  The character animation pulls the game back up again, though.  Hotsuma's moves perfectly match his look, and the completed version tidies up the camera issues that made the game's brief cutscenes come off poorly in early previews.  Killing four or more enemies in rapid succession results in a brief cutaway -- Hotsuma poses a bit as bisected opponents fall apart -- serving as a nifty punctuation to particularly rapid attacks.  It's nothing too intrusive, since the cutscenes are kept down to a couple of seconds, and since they only appear at the definitive end of a fight, they're never going to disorient you in a tense moment.  Sound This is, at least, the proper way to do a simple, old-school soundtrack.  The music in Shinobi definitely recalls the Genesis, but in a good way -- it has the same quick tempo and evergreen beats that kept the old Shinobis and games like Streets of Rage moving forward.  More complex modern instrumentation occasionally intrudes, but it never overpowers the nostalgic feel of the music.  If you don't think that will sound quite exciting enough, the effects kick the intensity up a notch.  There's no reason to hold back that aspect of the sound design, after all, so we get some nice, detailed high-fidelity sounds for exploding background objects, flaming death rattles, and Hotsuma's arsenal of magic attacks.  Sega also has our undying thanks for throwing in an option to select Japanese or English voices -- whichever one you like, you can pick without difficulty.That would be the single, tiny aspect of the game that lacks difficulty.  Nifty segue, huh?Shinobi, much like Contra, is something I can better admire from a distance.  I'm impressed by its finer points, but on the other hand, I probably screamed more profanities at this game than every other title I've played this year.  I'm not sure if there's such a thing as ~too hard,~ but if you don't have any problem with that designation, it belongs on Shinobi.I did stick with this game, though, which I suppose says something.  It offers some cool rewards for the persistent, both in the enemy designs of its later levels and in the toybox of unlockable extras, and at its best, the experience of controlling Hotsuma is up there with the best 3D action games.  As I say, this is worth a go, but I refuse to accept blame for what irresponsible acts you may commit in a fit of blind rage.  Hey, just tell the judge Shinobi made you do it.", "date": "Nov 12, 2002"}
