As I sit here, blood pressure finally dropping back to normal levels after nearly tearing the game out of the PlayStation 2 to snap it in half and walk away, without ever putting fingers to keys, it strikes me that there's no more perfect of an example of how a truly good developer makes a franchise, not the other way around.   When Insomniac opted to part ways with the mascot that was as much a figurehead of the developer as it was the original PlayStation, it was a gutsy move. Of course, we know now that Spyro's success wasn't a fluke, as Ratchet & Clank was a bona-fide killer app for the PlayStation 2, but the little purple dragon was left with Universal as the IP holder and no clear developer to continue a series that had sold millions of copies.    Hooray for bright colors. A few different developers stepped up to carry on the franchise, but it wasn't until Aussie platformer vets Krome Studios came on board to give the series something of a reboot that the franchise got a proper identity. Conceived as a slightly darker trilogy, The Legend of Spyro is trying to inject a little more in the way of mythos and lore into the pint-sized fire-breather's world. The first game, A New Beginning, surprised plenty of folks with its higher production values and Hollywood voice cast, and while those elements remain to some degree, the second game has taken a major step backward in terms of how the game actually plays.   Specifically: it's ridiculously difficult in certain areas, suffers from sloppy controls, tons of cheap deaths and lacks some of the polish that Krome is more than capable of. The Eternal Night eventually ends up being too difficult for a young audience, yet too pedantic for older gamers, and it satisfies neither. Clearly there was some effort at crafting a story (even if almost all of it is actually revealed in an expository sequence near the end), but the production values in the cinematics were squandered on a game that just doesn't click in any one area and it outright offends in others.    It doesn't help that Spyro starts his second chapter of a new adventure effectively powerless. Prone to blackout sessions that gradually unlock the fire, ice, earth and lightning powers from the last game, much of The Eternal Night is spent playing catch up while slogging through wave after wave of enemies using a battle system that boils down to button mashing (or, if you're like me, you'll discover early on that using Spyro's new time dilation powers to slow things down lets you just roast enemies, because it consumes hardly any of your special attack meter). For a game that has its roots in platforming, it feels odd to spend more time mindlessly tail-whipping the same few enemies for hours at a time.    Magic circles! When the game does venture into platforming territory, it's almost always filled with more than a few cheap deaths. There's no penalty for dying (beyond having to replay through some sections, which can also mean killing the same enemies over and over again, and at times is almost reason enough to kill any momentum you might have), but thanks to a tight double-jump window that sometimes won't register the second button press, I became intimately familiar with what it sounds like to hear a dragon plummet to his death constantly. When a platforming game -- even one with far less of a focus on jumping and gliding -- can't even get the jumping parts down, you know there's a problem.   So the game has moved toward combat; that in and of itself isn't enough to ruin the game (this is supposed to be a retelling of the Spyro storyline, apparently), but the combat is fundamentally flawed. It's possible to get hung up on bigger enemies, and their attacks often come during the down arc of a double-jump -- a jump needed to dodge the initial attack in the first place. Worse, still, it's not only possible, but common to be hit by one enemy with an attack that dazes Spyro only to have another enemy or two sneak in hits. Spyro can only take about four or five hits from even common enemies before he dies, so again, this can lead to infuriating, unavoidable deaths. I don't mind a challenge, but I absolutely detest games that hit you when you're down -- especially since most of the enemies in the game suffer from reduced damage when they're down -- if not outright invulnerability.     Using Dragon Time (yes, that's just Bullet Time with a word swapped out, I'm sure you can guess what it does) is sort of the crux of most of the game's ~puzzles~ which really aren't terribly difficult save for one little section with crab-like enemies that you have to double-jump and stomp -- but even that was only a head-scratcher because the game gives you zero indication of what to do, and these enemies just show up randomly a good portion into the game. All the other puzzles revolve around clumsily navigating floating platforms, flicking switches and pushing cannonballs/orbs around, and nearly all of them are recycled multiple times with the location swapped out.   Krome's in-house Merkury Engine does a decent job, but none of the environments or characters are pulled off with the kind of visual aplomb as the Naughty Dog or Insomniac platformers on the PS2. Granted, the budget and team sizes aren't the same, but the relatively low-poly characters and overabundance of colored lighting (seriously, the game is rife with reds and blues and greens eeeverywhere) give the game a slightly cheap feel.    He's in the air, folks. The PlayStation 2 has always been a particle powerhouse, and that muscle is tapped nicely for some of the game's special effects (in particular the game's Rage attacks, which hit everything in a wide radius and are kicked off with Matrix-style bit of variable speed and 360 rotation -- cheesy and a little late, sure, but some of them do look fairly neat). No part of the engine will seriously surprise; in fact, for seven year hardware, some parts of the game are, visually, rather disappointing - some massive framerate dives and slowdown pop up when the effects are piled on. Again, it just feels like the polish that could have been there just isn't.    The new storyline brings with it a darker, more choir-heavy soundtrack, and though it can come off as a little heavy-handed, it fits the visuals. Gary Oldman, Elijah Wood and Billy West all donated their pipes to the bigger roles in the game, but the performances feel largely phoned in and lack earnestness. Billy West especially laid down some incredibly weak lines, though that could be as much the fact that the dialogue in the game can come off as trite and lame. Sparx as a character just comes off as a worthless, whiny jerk and even the voice of Philip J. Fry can't save some wince-inducing lines.   Ooo, a flying ship. The biggest problem with Eternal Night is just how damn pointlessly difficult it is. Even early on the game treated me to near-constant falling deaths and gang-up enemy attacks, but I wanted to push on and beat the game if only to see how it all ended. Unfortunately, a section with constantly spawning enemies (peppered with numerous NeoGAF and #vidgames member references, hi Gaz!) was my undoing. After boss fights over bottomless pits, sloppy platforming bits and a spoon-fed storyline, battling wave after wave of enemies was the breaking point. Just thinking about the part makes me want to punch babies; it's pointlessly difficult and absolutely unnecessary. Come to think of it, that describes the whole of Spyro's latest outing rather nicely.", "date": "Oct 26, 2007"}
