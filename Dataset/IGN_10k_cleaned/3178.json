Everyone's favorite ice game never had more prominence in the console world than when EA's NHL series was king on Sega's Genesis.  Now EA and Sega are bitter sports rivals.  With EA's NHL 2003 released a month earlier, the challenge to do EA one better is going to be tough for Sega.  However, developers Treyarch and Visual Concepts have done a masterful job with the game of hockey, creating a unique blend of accurate simulation and arcade smack.   Features  Every NHL team, stadium, and player Full-level of customizable strategies to bring you the most realistic hockey possible Check players against the boards and then battle it out with elbows and knees as you try to jar the puck loose Realistic goalie momentum offers a high level of realism around the net Dolby Digital 5.1 This year's only online hockey game!  Gameplay NHL 2K3 is Sega's first hockey release on Xbox and they sure didn't miss the mark with this one.  Sega prides themselves on producing sports games that are as realistic as possible.  And that is certainly true of NHL 2K3, which offers as high a level of hockey simulation as you'd want in a console.  However, this could easily have been a problem.  Most people who buy hockey games are not hockey fans.  They don't watch the sport much on TV, don't even understand certain aspects of the game, and just want a fun arcade experience, the kind EA has provided them for many years.  I'm among those casual fans.  But having spent the better part of a month playing NHL 2K3 I've come to this conclusion -- despite it's great sim aspects, NHL 2K3 has much of the arcade oomf of its hockey contenders.    At the same time, NHL 2K3 is definitely a simulation.  But for those just wanting the arcade experience, NHL 2K3 is set up in such a way that many of the simulation aspects can be handled by the computer, freeing you to just play hockey.  There are a slew of different defensive and offensive strategies you can set.  Choose how to play a five-man power play or how to defense when you're on a four-man penalty kill.  Sub lines if you want, edit your lines, and adjust your roster as injuries occur.  Or let the AI handle all of it for you.  You can't really ask more from a sports game -- let you play the complete realm of simulation or just concentrate on playing the game.   On the same token, the controls are also adjustable for those wanting a pure arcade experience or for those needing full puck control.  Basic, intermediate, and advanced control settings are available.  With basic controls, you have as stripped-down a control scheme as possible, allowing for incredibly easy pick-up-and-playability.  But any sports fan with even the tiniest set of stones will go to the advanced settings, which allow for total control over your players.  The trick here is that the advanced controls require you to hold down the trigger as a modifier.  Each button ends up with two functions on both offense and defense, with the modifier allowing you to be more specific about things like the type of shot you make.  For example, without the modifier, you can shoot a wrist shot, but hold down the trigger and you can shoot a charged up slapshot.  Passing can offer a normal pass or (with modifier) a flip pass.  It will take you a couple of games to get used to the modifiers, but once you do, they become second nature.  And this is absolutely how NHL 2K3 was meant to be played.  You have more control over players with and away from the puck than any other hockey game on the market.    Total control brings an intensity and pleasure to hockey that I've never seen on a console game before.  Yes, hockey is always going to be exciting when playing against some buddies, but NHL 2K3's enhanced controls make the game a true challenge and pleasure when you're all by your lonesome.    NHL 2K3 is hockey done right.  The AI for both your teammates and opponents is superb.  While you can certainly score from time to time by simply taking the puck yourself and trying to challenge the goalie one-on-one, you'll need to pass the puck and play proper hockey if you want to win consistently.  Clearing opponents away from the net, setting screens, pinning players to the boards, dumping the puck off, snagging the puck in mid-air, checking, and playing smart are all crucial to being successful.  While that may seem daunting, it's surprising how easy it becomes after playing NHL 2K3 for a while.  Even those who know little about hockey will learn the game by playing 2K3.  While it's not a perfect translation of hockey, it's about as close as you can get without becoming too much of a sim.  A couple of new things were added to Sega's hockey masterpiece from last year's Dreamcast version.  Both add new dimensions to the game and increase the realism.  First is my favorite, the boards.  Players check one another into the boards and players can get pinned against the boards in a fight for the puck.  When you've got the puck, an opponent can slam you against the board and then by trying to check you against the boards or push you, try and free up the puck.  Your job in this situation is to elbow the opponent or kick the puck free to a teammate.  What's best is seeing this happen away from you.  It's a sign that every player on the ice is being used at all times, that every player is important at each moment, instead of just the puck carrier and the goalie. Unfortunately, play on the boards doesn't happen nearly enough.  More board action would have been better, but it's still good to see it included  The second addition is really an enhancement of goalie physics.  Goalies have true momentum this year and the goalie engine has been redesigned to make goalie reactions as true as possible.  For example, if you make a shot that a goalie has to dive for, he'll have to push himself up and re-center himself to be ready to block the next shot.  This means that rebounding is crucial, because you'll need to take advantage of a fallen goalie.  But this momentum doesn't end there.  A kick save to the left means the goal is open on the right side.  And a goalie will even reach back for a puck, sometimes causing them to fall on their rump.  Goalies cover the puck up, drop to their knees, and react in some incredibly realistic ways.  Not only does this make for some great animations, but it also makes it very hard to score goals.  This is why you have to think in real hockey terms as far as fooling the goalie, clearing out the net, and taking advantage of rebounds.        Yes, all of this sounds very heavy on sim aspects, but NHL 2K3 still contains some brutal checks, fast action, turbo boost, and fighting.  Despite the need to think more than most NHL games, gameplay is so fast, quick, and fun, that it never feels like its relying too heavy on its sim aspects like NBA 2K3 and NFL 2K3.  Perhaps it's because NHL 2K3 was developed by Treyarch and not directly by Visual Concepts.  The fun hasn't been drained from this game, and that's what keeps me coming back for more.  No hockey game would be complete without some fisticuffs and NHL 2K3 offers some rather basic button-mashing slugfests.  There's only three things to worry about in a fight -- grab, punch, and duck.  It's simple and a fun distraction, but even when you kick the fighting slider to the max, fights are still a rare sight.  Come now, if I push the fighting slider to the max it means I want lots of fights, so why deny me my own desire?    So far so good, hmm?  Well, not everything is honkey-dorey in paradise.  NHL 2K3 fails in the same spot every other Sega Sports game stumbles.  The presentation has problems.  Sega always seems to get the game right in the arena, but there's always a slew of minor annoyances that hold their games back.  NHL 2K3 is no exception.   First and foremost, NHL 2K3 doesn't feature the new graphical inputs that NBA and NFL 2K3 added.  Franchise mode has no general managers office, it's just a text menu.  It seems like a foregone conclusion that all Sega Sports games from NFl 2K3 on would feature the new look, but NHL 2K3 misses the boat and (though new to Xbox), makes it seems like last year's model.  Beyond this, there's a ton of minor, nagging annoyances.  One of the worst is some of the default options.  Home and away team strategy changes default to manual rather than automatic.  No biggie, right?  Only problem is, this counts for AI controlled teams as well.  That means an AI team cannot change their strategy.  You have to know (somehow) to set their strategy to automatic, otherwise the computer won't perform even the most basic of strategy changes, like pulling a goalie when down by one goal with only a minute left to play.  That's sloppy.  And then the other problem is that even when enabled, teams rarely ever pull their goalies.  When you're down a goal with almost no time left, you pull your goalie.  It's that simple.  Another good example comes when winning the Stanley Cup.   The winning team skates the ice, hoisting the cup in celebration.  That's great.  However, the announcers then say things like ~And the Sharks are one step closer to drinking from Lord Stanley's Cup.~  That's right, they don't shout about how the Sharks just won, they act as if the Sharks only won their third game of the playoffs.  Granted, the announcers offer playoff specific commentary, which is great, but if you go down a particular road you have to see it all the way through.  Otherwise, don't even bother.  Nothing is worse than seeing celebratory animation only to then hear a commentator say something utterly out of place.  How can you think to add a Stanley Cup celebration but no voice additions for that celebration?    On the plus side, NHL 2K3 offers a slew of important player stats which track over a players career.  There are also fifteen awards handed out each year and every award is archived for ten years.  Not bad.  But it would be nice to see Sega offer a complete presentation package instead of a mixture of good and bad.  NHL 2K2 didn't have a franchise mode, but 2K3 rectifies this.  The franchise mode is pretty standard with each team having a budget and the ability to list players as dressed, scratched, or in the minors.  But the franchise mode isn't as deep as any of the other Sega games, which is a bit of a let down.  However, one nice note is that through a dozen seasons there were no peculiarities.  No real bad trades (in fact, not many trades at all) and good teams tended to win and bad teams tended to lose.  That's the main thing you ask from a franchise mode -- a dose of reality.  And for that, NHL 2K3 does just fine.  Online Xbox gets the only online hockey game this year and NHL 2K3 is a great online game.  Though there are some occasional spots of lag, NHL 2K3 offers a fantastic experience.  Featuring the Xbox Live staples of quick match and optimatch options, NHL 2K3 lets you search for your freinds or set up your own game.  One gripe is with the optimatch.  While you have the ability to search for games with various settings like penalties and difficulty, there's no ~any~ options.  What if I want a rookie game but I don't care how high or low the fight settings are?  Too bad.  Beyond this, though, NHL 2K3 online is like playing with your buddies only your buddies are sitting on a couch on the other side of the country.  No downloadable content is a bit of a let down, but online gives an extra level of replay to NHL 2K3.   Graphics Visually, NHL 2K3 has two things going for it -- good animations and great replays.  Players look realistic and lifelike, the ice gets scratched up by skates as you play, and a vicious crosscheck looks sufficiently painful.  But NHL 2K3 doesn't push any graphical limits.  The rink reflects some objects in the environment, but players have no reflection, just weak shadows.    The replays are great and done perfectly.  You'll always get accurate replays of goals and replays showing every single penalty when they occur.  This far outdoes EA's hockey game, which shows mostly scripted replays that have nothing to do with the actual action on the ice.  You get a chase camera which tracks a player in the replay and also the excellent net cam which gives a great view of goals and saves.  With jaggies and a lot of bland faces which don't appear very unique, NHL 2K3 doesn't offer the visual punch of other Sega Sports games.  Also the default camera is quite pulled back and the players look a bit too small for the size of the rink.  That's likely a perceptual thing, but it's still a bit of a nuissance.  A decent-looking game, but not quite the quality Sega typically produces.    Sound Michael A. Carlucci doing the play by play and Danny Mann offering color commentary do a fine job.  Though there's plenty of repetition, the dialogue is both informative, generally accurate, and not dry in the least.  It's not off-the-cuff zany stuff (though a few offbeat lines slipped through the cracks and ended up in-game), but it's more of a conversational tone, something Sega may want to consider for their other sports titles.  There are some technical problems though.  Many of the inserts sound unnatural so, for example, when Carlucci says something and the game inserts the words ~San Jose Sharks~, there's often a pause.  This is something very common in sports games, but something many games have overcome in the past year.  NHL 2K3, though, lags behind.  The crowds sound good, but not as varied or unique as other Sega games.  Just as with the visuals, NHL 2K3 comes off as the less attractive daughter.  Sure, you'd still give her the time of day, but you'll be thinking ~why can't she be more like Sally,~ the entire time. I love console hockey.  I admit I'm only a casual real-world NHL fan, but NHL 2K3 has done an amazing thing -- it's made me want to learn more about hockey.  In fact, it's turned me into a more serious hockey fan.  That's saying something for a game designed for those already devoted to the church of Lord Stanley.  NHL 2K3 is a real prize wtih some fantastic gameplay, but it's hampered by a variety of nagging ~why nots~ that have plagued many Sega Sports games.  With decent, but not spectacular visuals and sound, NHL 2K3 seems less stunning than its other Sega siblings.  Still, if you are a fan of hockey or if you want to try hockey on a level beyond Hitz and NHL 2003, then this is absolutely the way to go.  And it doesn't hurt that it's online!", "date": "Nov 11, 2002"}
