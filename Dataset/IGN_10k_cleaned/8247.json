Out of all the sports shown on UK television (like football, cricket, rugby, darts or kabaddi) snooker is the second most-watched professional hobby. Probably because the slow-paced action and hushed whispers of commentary, combined with a late night TV slot, mean it's the perfect show to sooth you to sleep. So, with a pillow at the ready (just in case), it's time we chalked up our cue.   Obviously, as with any niche sport, those that like the odd frame now and again are already likely to have World Snooker Championship 2007 high on their list of purchases while everyone else will probably overlook the game, regardless of its quality. That would be a shame though - the simplicity of World Snooker Championship 2007's controls and its reliance on tactics as well as skill make for a game that's just begging for a wider audience. In fact, even if you don't know your cues from your cucumbers, there's plenty here to enjoy, thanks to some genuinely involving gameplay.   Beginners can soon get to grips with pocketing potentially tricky shots like this.  Even the most unskilled snooker player can quickly pull off shots that would have Steve Davis choking on a biscuit, while advanced techniques such as spin and final ball position are just a few joypad presses away. What's more, the learning curve is surprisingly gentle and it's only after you pot several balls in a row that you realise you're truly getting to grips with the finer points of a game that's extremely tricky in reality.   If you're not too confident with your own abilities, there's a thorough tutorial mode to take you through the basics too, featuring beardy snooker favourite John Virgo. During matches, you'll also be able to call on his expertise to advise you what shots to pull off next - just in case you need a bit of extra hand-holding.   There's a good range of different cue sports on offer, all extremely accessible.  However, as always, practice makes perfect so you might want to push aside the tutorial features and dive into the deep end by starting one of the various tournaments on offer. As well as snooker competitions, you can also play in pool tournaments or create your own hybrid event featuring pool and snooker matches from around the world. Although you might lose the first few frames, you'll soon be sinking balls like entrants in a tea-bagging championship. When you're up to speed, you can also venture online to challenge opponents, showing off your hard-earned snooker skills.   Without wanting to heap too much praise on the game's accessibilty, even simple things like the potting order of your balls are displayed before you take your shots. It might sound stupid to a pro, but does Joe Public really know whether to sink the brown or green first? Another nice touch is the way the game engine displays not only the route of the coloured ball you're aiming for, but also the predicted angle of the white ball once it's hit your chosen target.     Thankfully your hand isn't held too tightly though and snooker stalwarts can disable some of the game's more molly-coddling features. What's more, when taking harder shots at more acute angles the line of predicted trajectory for the coloured ball becomes smaller. As a result, for all its accessibility, skill is still vital for success in the game. For example, although placing touches of spin on the ball won't affect the line of prediction, once you attempt more complex shots, it'll disappear completely. Mastery of the spin is your key to victory in the more difficult stages of the competitions.   Of course, if snooker becomes tiresome, there's always pool to keep your interest ticking over. Without wanting to cause too much controversy, we're going to suggest pool simply isn't quite so demanding of skills as snooker. A match can be over in a few simple shots and we reckon professional players must have to play with their eyes shut to ramp up the excitement.   However, once again World Snooker Championship 2007's flexible game engine means even the most ham-fisted player is likely to discover they've got hidden cue-based talents. That said, one criticism we have with the game is the entirely ruthless AI of your computer opponents. This is noticeable in snooker, but even more so in pool where just one wrong shot can give your AI competitor the opening they need to clean right up. Even in easier tournaments, if the computer can rub your face in the dirt it will, leaving you to watch despairingly as ball after ball sinks from sight.   Trust us, screenshots make the game look a lot better than it is. On the subject of faces, it's worth noting that World Snooker Championship 2007 offers the tools to create your own players from scratch. The thing is though, try as you might to create realistic representations of yourself, the tools just aren't advanced enough to conjure up anything that doesn't look almost exactly like a serial killer. The monstrous nature of your creations isn't made any better when in-game cut-scenes feature players attempting some truly bizarre facial expressions in reaction to good or bad shots. Their eyes bulge, they bite their lips and generally look like they're fighting off explosive diarrhoea rather than playing snooker. Sadly, visual quality is an issue with the game as a whole - developer Blade has fallen significantly short of the next-gen bar and the results are frequently ugly.   Compared to the Xbox 360 game, this PS3 iteration has borne the brunt of the ugly stick. Although gameplay is a fluid, just like the 360 game, it certainly seems to struggle visually. For instance, even in the most basic scene, showing your ball rolling toward the pocket, the frame rate barely manages to stay at 30 frames-per-second. What's even worse, that old stand-by motion blur comes into play on the balls in a bid to disguise the chugging movement. Not what you'd expect from Sony's 'wonder machine'.   Pool is the poor man's snooker. But at least you can play it while drunk. An even bigger disappointment is the lack of any decent commentary during games. Even with the likes of John Virgo, Steve Davis and John Parrott lining up to provide words of wisdom, there just doesn't seem to be enough variety on offer. After only an hour of play it feels like you've heard everything they've got to say. Meanwhile, the vocally-incontinent American woman babbling over pool tournaments is just plain irritating. It's best to switch the sound off entirely when playing unless you actually like being put off your strokes.What World Snooker Championship 2007 does exceptionally well is make the potentially tricky sport of snooker accessible and enjoyable for those who've never even touched a cue. With its intuitive controls, it enables beginners get to grips with potting a few balls, while skilled snooker players can pull off more complex techniques like spin. However, no matter how accessible the gameplay may be, visually it's atrocious and the frame rate is all over the place. As a snooker simulation there's no faulting World Snooker Championship 2007's gameplay but, if you're expecting it to show off your PS3's graphical grunt, you've got more chance of getting a 147 break with your eyes closed.", "date": "Mar 21, 2007"}
