Hold on, that's not entirely true. Few US gamers know this, but this is actually the second SimCity title that has made it to Nintendo 64. Imagineer managed to beat Nintendo to the punch and released SimCity 2000 back in 1997. While SimCity 64 is a step up from its predecessor in many respects, it shares a lot of the same problems when it comes to speed and navigation.The basic gameplay remains unchanged since the original SimCity. Using simple on-screen menus, players reshape the landscape, set up residential, business and industrial zones, build transportation grids, electric supply, schools and other public institutions and watch their city grow. Where SimCity 64 departs from its PC and console predecessors is the ability to zoom in and actually walk the streets of your own city from a first-person perspective. But that's not all. Build a transportation network and you'll be able to ride around in a train, a bus or even fly through town in a helicopter. Interestingly, SimCity 64 was originally designed to interface with the long-cancelled SimCopter 64. If the flying experience in SimCity 64 is any indication of what SimCopter 64 was going to be like, then EA and Nintendo were smart to can it. This game engine sucks. Despite the fact that SimCity 64 runs on an N64 with expanded RAM, the low-res graphics chug along at horrendous framerates that not only ruin the visuals, but also seriously affect control. The big problem isn't that the street sequences slow down to about 10 frames per second -- it's the zoomed out view of your city that causes the most problems. Due to the low framerate, selecting a building or editing zones and landscapes becomes a real chore. But it's not just framerate -- the building textures are blurry, there is fog galore and the sim-citizens that populate your town are poorly animated, blocky 2D sprites. Even the disasters are unexciting. Take one look at this game in action and you realize that the game design is far too complex to be pulled off effectively on N64.Luckily, underneath all these cosmetic problems SimCity fans will recognize the same addictive gameplay that has made the series a hit all around the world. Along with the patented city building play mechanics come a slew of interesting new additions. Problems in your city are no longer shown on the map/build screen. That's where the zoom feature comes in. Your citizens will gladly let you know what they think is wrong with their neighborhood. Once in awhile, you will even be challenged to a hide-and-seek of sorts, where you have to use a simple radar screen to track down a specific citizen. Find him or her and you'll get some extra money to spend on new buildings. And although most games SimCity 64 was supposed to interface with got canned, you can actually import a basic two-frame character animation from Mario Artist: Paint Studio and have it live in your city. Neat idea. Sadly, you can only import one character per city.Once thought to be a 64DD killer app that would showcase the ability to swap data between multiple disk- and cart-based titles, SimCity 64 ended up a sluggish, slightly above average semi-sequel marred by one of the worst 3D engines in N64 history. It speaks for the series' strong game design that despite all these problems, SimCity 64 can be a lot fun. Nintendo's disk-based SimCity 64 is better than Imagineer's cartridge version of SimCity 2000, but even with all the new additions it's not nearly as fun to play as any of its PC predecessors. Another so-so game to add to the 64DD game library. Are you still wondering why Nintendo of America never brought out the disk drive stateside?On a side note: Why didn't this game come out on cartridge? Seriously, the ability to save umpteen different cities to disk isn't really that important. Give me four save slots and I'm happy.", "date": "Jul 29, 2000"}
