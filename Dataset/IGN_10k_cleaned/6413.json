At the time, the series was fun, frantic, over-the-top arcade racing enjoyment, even with its awkward, unrealistic artistic and action style. After an original game and a follow-up sequel on the N64 as well as a Japanese-only PlayStation release, Atlus put the series on ice. After a half-decade hiatus, the company's ready to bring the boarding series to the handheld with an updated concept: the hipper, cooler, more righteous (and redundantly titled) SBK: Snowboard Kids. Whether it's the release's unfortunate timing or simply an overall underwhelming snowboarding experience, we're just not feeling the love for Snowboard Kids. This racing design has a good amount of ups, but its downs are real downers.The Snowboard Kids design never attempts to hit upon the ~realism~ of the winter sport like games such as 1080 or Amped. It's more a setting and location for a Mario Kart-style race, replacing the karts with snowboards, and including all of the inherent environmental elements that go along with the mountain environment. Only the underlying gameplay structure remains in the Nintendo DS remake - gone are the ugly, short and squat big-headed snowboarders of the original N64 production. Instead, Atlus has hipped up the environment with some radical big air-grabbing mofos of stereotypical locales, complete with vocal attitude like ~Rad!~ Or ~This blows!~ when they win or lose. The game's use of the boarding  clichs is almost annoyingly over the top and definitely makes us want the more simplistic and unpolluted original characterizations of the original Snowboard Kidsas ugly as they used to be.It's a four man race down a variety of slopes in a variety of competition conditions - each challenge has its own criteria to meet, from coming in at least second or first, or scoring a set number of points before crossing the finish line. The changing of the racing quota does give SBK: Snowboard Kids a good amount of variety, and it's the missions where you don't have to worry about the opposition that bring out the design' fun. Scoring points by tricking off jumps or scooping up strategically-placed gems or shushing through rings for more time is definitely enjoyable. Unfortunately, that's only a fraction of the design, and it's what the designers focus on for the meat of the game that makes the game frustrating more than amusing.In the four player challenges, it's a race to the bottom of the mountain trying to out-ski the opponents to come in first. The designers spice up, or at least try to spice up, the action by awarding offensive and defensive weapons like parachutes to slow down opponents, 1000 ton weights that drop down from the sky, or even simple energy blasts that seek out the person in the lead and take him out.  These power-ups are nothing new, and games like Mario Kart excel in putting these non-racing focused elements into the mix to jazz up the gameplay. But these items lack any sort of strategy: you pick it up, you fire it, it hits the target and pisses off the opponent. And boy, do they do a great job pissing them off; there's really no inherent defense against incoming projectiles, the most common of all the annoying power-ups. If one's bearing down on you, you simply have to grit your teeth and take it like a man as it slams you down into the snow. Or into a crevasse. Or into that same crevasse when you're repositioned back on the course. Or it simply screws up your airborne jump. There have been instances where a well-timed hop managed to negate a projectile, but that was a one-in-a-thousand shot and more luck than skill. This focus on weaponry may have been the designers' way to inject a lot of energy into the snowboarding, but it instead irritates, annoys, and frustrates more than it energizes. Thank god there are non-combat single-player races to enjoy - they save SBK: Snowboard Kids from the land of the Bad DS games.Outside of a really slick and streamlined navigation menu, the touch screen elements are simply relegated as controls to pull off special airborne moves. Because the touch screen allows the designers to be creative with their button designs, the moves are constantly changing when you launch off a jump: tap the square X number of times, tap the squares in sequential order, or just tap all the squares. But because these special moves both take a significant amount of time to both pull off on the touch screen as well as play out in animation, the chances of actually landing these specials are downright slim. Essentially there's not much incentive in doing these moves outside of losing a few extra points since the risk outweighs the rewards way too much. It's unfortunately just bad timing for Atlus, releasing a ~Mario Kart-on-Snow design exactly a week after a real-deal Mario Kart design - and the greatest MK design ever -- hits the scene. But even more unfortunate is that Snowboard Kids just doesn't have any real arcade racing balance in its main focus. The weapon aspect is simply thrown in with very little strategy for the victim or the aggressor, simply boiling these weapons down to a basic button press when they're obtained. The snowboarding gets much better when these weapons aren't even in the mix - the time trials and slalom missions are the game's saving grace.", "date": "Nov 22, 2005"}
