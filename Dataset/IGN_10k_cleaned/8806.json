It was, early on, a game company just like any other  focused on arcade-like experiences in the wake of an arcade-focused era. Radarscope, its first major coin-op release in the States, was a clone of alien-blasting games like Space Invaders and Galaxian. Clu Clu Land, one of the 18 NES launch titles, was a knock-off of Pac-Man in many ways. And this game, Balloon Fight, was better known by players in the '80s by the much more memorable name, Joust.   That's not to say that Balloon Fight didn't innovate in its own way  it did, but its overall structure and style of play is heavily influenced by Midway's game of knights, lances and flying ostriches. The knights are now normal men clad in helmets and overalls, the lances have become the pointed ~beaks~ of the enemy fighters, and the flying is achieved not by riding astride a flapping bird, but by flapping your arms while balloons are attached to your back.   The goal of Balloon Fight is to flap your fighter into the sky and face off against some flying foes, attacking and popping their balloons before they can do the same to yours. Once you've knocked an enemy out of the air, he'll drift slowly to the ground below with a parachute  administering a second attack during his descent will eliminate him for good.   The core combat of the game is fun and simple, and has that added touch of Nintendo accessibility that Joust could not have claimed  and here on the Virtual Console, where Joust is not yet available as an alternative, Balloon Fight stands out as more unique than it otherwise would be. A welcome feature is Fight's support for two players simultaneously, as with other Nintendo co-op games of the same age you can choose to work together with your friend, or ruthlessly assault them and try to claim the high score yourself.   An extra mode called Balloon Trip is also available, and changes the focus from fight to flight  you're presented with a forced-scrolling screen full of electrified obstacles, and tasked to survive as long as possible while ducking, dodging and never descending. There's no land to land on down below, just an endless ocean that's home to hungry, human-eating fish. The Trip's a true challenge  it'll take practice, patience and skill on the flap trigger to wing your way through any significant portion of the course.   Balloon Fight's a welcome addition to the NES Virtual Console lineup. As a second wave 8-bit title from 1986, it's not quite as early as the Big N's earliest '80s efforts, and though it clones the scenario and style of Midway's Joust, it adds enough to the formula to make its Fights feel unique. Download this one if you're a fan of simple, one-screen arcade action. Don't download this one if you already own it in another form  like as an item in your virtual Animal Crossing home.", "date": "Jul 21, 2007"}
