The developer's Resident Evil (remake) for GameCube last year wowed and shocked us with its supreme attention to detail, and Resident Evil 0 after that with its dark storyline and more intuitive play mechanics. And in 2004, we've got Resident Evil 4, a full-blown, completely made-over update to the series which takes place in full 3D. We've seen the evolution of one of Capcom's and indeed the industry's most beloved franchises, and we await the revolution, which is why it's all the more difficult to turn back our clocks more than five years and play the original Resident Evil offerings, totally unaltered, and unrefined by comparison.  That's exactly what Capcom has asked us to do with the GameCube release of Resident Evil 2. Unlike director Shinji Mikami's remake, this GCN port remains perfectly intact. As one Capcom spokesperson put it, ~not a single polygon has been changed.~ Given that Resident Evil 2 was a solid entry when it released in 1998 and a classic by today's standards, purists and those totally unfamiliar with the series may be willing to overlook the outdated graphics and robotic controls for the chance to explore Resident Evil history. What is extremely disappointing is that Capcom has failed to deliver this five-year-old game at a discounted price.  The Facts  Two separate adventures: Play as Leon Kennedy or Claire Redfield in an all out struggle for survival Explore a zombie-infested city and police station Collect items and acquire different weapons to kill zombies and other creatures Loaded with hidden items and vital information about the Resident Evil saga Hidden game modes: 4th Survivor and secret character, Tofu Adjust the intensity of the game according to player's skill and experience Unchanged PS1 port -- no major visual or audio differences Does not run in progressive scan mode or DPLII Requires one memory block for saves   Gameplay Resident Evil 2 picks up shortly after the events that transpired in the first game. Characters Leon Kennedy, a cop, and Claire Redfield (yes, she's related to Chris) find themselves in Raccoon City during another outbreak of the infamous T-Virus. Zombies are everywhere. Cars are crashed in the streets and afire, bodies litter the walkways, and general chaos has swept over the area. The game opens as the two characters meet, an event that unfolds first in a cut-scene -- one that was originally aired on PS1 and that incidentally looks dated on GameCube. The two eventually go their separate ways and it's up to you, choosing the storyline for either character, to survive the horror, as it were. The game takes you through the city streets, to the insides of an exquisite police station and beyond, and all the while introduces new plot developments, more gruesome monstrosities, and deeper scares.  We played and beat Resident Evil 2 several times when it initially released on PS1 and after trudging through the GameCube port, we can confidently state that there are no major differences. Which is, of course, both good and bad. On the one hand, the game still deals out rich scares, even if they are sometimes nicked by a visual presentation that now definitely shows its age. The story, B-movie-quality as it is, still grips and intrigues, and some of the puzzles, illogical as ever, are still satisfying. Meanwhile, there's quite a lot to see in the game, and when you've beaten it once, you can always go back and play as the other character for a slightly changed experience. And on the other hand, the robotic control setup still proves frustrating despite the fact that RE2 does at least utilize a ~Type C~ scheme in which the R button can be used to make characters walk and run. The difficulty remains, in our opinion, as unbalanced as ever, as there are sometimes just way too many zombies on-screen and very little room to maneuver. And, so far as we're concerned, there is the opinion that RE2 is simply an all-around inferior game to the original, which proves to be scarier, especially in Mikami's remake.  Everything weighed and considered, though, there's definitely enough in place in RE2 -- old, though it may be, to warrant serious consideration if you're either 1) a person who's never played the title before or 2) a ~survival horror~ purist looking to complete your collection. The bad news is that Capcom hasn't offered any real incentive to pick up the dated gem -- the game retails for a hefty $39.95, a straight rip-off since you can pick up exactly the same game on PS1 for one third the price.    Graphics Travel back to 1998 with us for a moment. We can remember being so amazed by Resident Evil 2's graphics that we cited the game as one of the most realistic looking titles ever created. That might have been true then, but it's certainly not the case now. Yes, the GameCube version of RE2 looks identical to the PS1 original. That means that it features the same 2D pre-rendered backdrops; the same textures; the same low polygon counts; the same character clipping problems; the same rough animation routines; the same simple particle effects -- and everything else, all weaved and sewn into one big, identical visual presentation. Is it an ugly game? Compared to other PS1 games in 1998, nope. But compared to Resident Evil remake, absolutely. And yet, the visuals still hold true enough that the general atmosphere of the game is not ruined. It's still a scary product, no doubt. You'll still be spooked by some of the creature designs if you've never seem them before, and purists will probably be happy enough that no qualities have been sacrificed in the transition to Nintendo's console.  Sound The audio side of RE2 has held up a lot better than the visual side. Go figure, huh? The stereo sound effects and moody music are ever eerie, and inject a good measure of ambience into the world. The voice acting is still borderline horrendous, but this is Resident Evil -- when is it not? On the downside, there is a noticeable dip in crispness and quality when compared to, say RE0 and there is no Pro Logic II support. Dim the lights and turn up the volume, though, and we guarantee you: the moans of zombies will still bring goose bumps to the back of your neck.Resident Evil 2 remains one of my preferred games on last generation's PlayStation and had the title been remade as Capcom revamped RE1, it might have been a remarkable GameCube title. As it stands, though, RE2 hits Nintendo's next-generation console totally unchanged and -- five years old, just feels completely outdated. The end port is not a bad one. Purists hoping to get all of the ~survival horror~ titles on one console will probably satisfied, and if you've never played RE2 before it's still an enjoyable enough adventure. It comes down to this: at $19.95, I'd recommend the game. But at $39.95, which sadly it retails for, I just don't think it's a good deal.Wait for it to drop in price if you've absolutely must own it. Otherwise, get the PS1 version. Or better yet, wait for what is bound to be an outstanding sequel in Resident Evil 4.", "date": "Jan 29, 2003"}
