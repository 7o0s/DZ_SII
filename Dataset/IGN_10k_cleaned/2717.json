I'm here to tell you that the underdog, Unreal Tournament, has more than stomped on the presumed king of frag.   So what is so great about Unreal Tournament? After all, it is based on technology that is antiquated by today's standards (the Unreal engine.) The answer can be summed up on one word: Variety. With the emphasis in the first person shooter market moving towards an online deathmatch model, the game with the most variety is probably going to draw in more players. Unreal Tournament ships with a huge assortment of weapons, and some really novel game play modes, including Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch, Domination, Capture the Flag, and Assault.   DeathMatch  This one is the straight forward play mode that we all know and love. Free for all carnage or team against team. Now here is where the variety comes into play: You can engage in standard deathmatch modes like Chainsaw melee, flak Arena, and Rocket Arena, but you add additional options via UT's ~Mutators~ for game play enhancements like InstaGib - one shot kill, low gravity, and stealth - everybody's invisible! Possibly the most entertaining Mutator is Fatboy. Every time you get killed, you get a little smaller and more difficult to hit. Every time you kill someone, you get a little fatter and easier to hit. Play well and you're a huge moving target. While these mutators make traditional deathmatching more interesting, they apply to all the other game types as well.   Capture the Flag  This one is another oldie but goodie. Each team has a base and a flag. Get to the flag and return to your base. The goal here isn't to rack up frags but to rack up score based on flag captures.   Domination  This one is like capture the flag, only different. There are a number of flag type icons distributed about the map. Each team tries to turn the flag to their color by running over it. The goal in this game mode is to hold the flag in your color for as long as possible to build up a score. The longer you hold a flag and the more flags you hold, the quicker you build up a score. When you reach the point goal, you win.   Assault  This is by far the most entertaining game mode in the game. One team holds a location, the other team tries to take it. If the assaulting team can take the position before the timer runs down, they win. It sounds simple, but this is where team work really pays off because if you're not working together, you're getting trounced. Period. After each mission, the two teams switch sides and start over. The competition to beat your opponents time is really addictive and the levels that were designed for this game type are simply some of the best I've ever played.   Of course no first person shooter can be considered up to snuff without a large arsenal of visually stunning, and opponent fragging, weapons. Once again, Unreal Tournament delivers with an even dozen implements of destruction.    In the non projectile department we have the Impact Hammer and the Chainsaw. Everybody comes equipped with the lethal, but misunderstood, Impact Hammer. Trigger the Hammer and it builds up power until you physically connect with an enemy, then it goes off killing instantly whoever you hit. Secondary mode is a quick, low power punch that can do a reasonable amount of damage or deflect incoming shots. The Chainsaw, on the other hand, is pretty obvious. Primary mode is a Jason Vorhees thrust, secondary mode is more of a Michael Meyers inspired side to side swipe.   A number of weapons players will recall from Unreal. The Enforcer is a standard pistol with a single shot, more accurate mode, and a rapid fire, less accurate secondary mode. If you every played Marathon, you'll also appreciate the ability to pick up a second Enforcer to go John Woo on your opponents.    The Ripper fires spinning blades of death that ricochet off of just about any surface except the soft white underbelly of your victim. Secondary mode fires blades that explode on impact.    The Rocket Launcher is also pretty close to the original. Fire and let go for a single shot. Fire and hold to build up a rocket cluster. Secondary fire to send explosives bouncing towards your foe like rubber balls.    The Flak Cannon is a shrapnel weapon. Primary fire sends shards of flak into whoever happens to be walking into your line of fire. Secondary sends a fragmentary grenade in the direction you fire, sending shrapnel in all directions as soon as it impacts a surface (or an opponent for that matter.) The shrapnel will also go around corners to damage anyone who might be hiding there.   The Shock rifle is also a familiar, but different fellow. It fires and energy beam that sort of explodes on impact. Secondary fire sends a glowing ball of death. Use the secondary fire to send an energy ball, then use primary fire to detonate it and you have a recipe for major damage.   UT's BioRifle is the new implementation of a Goo Gun, firing a blob of toxic slime that sticks to whatever it hits. Alternate fire shoots a bigger blob. What's it good for? Not much, unless somebody is chasing you and you lay down a goo trap.   The snipe rifle also puts in a return appearance working pretty much as it did in Unreal. Zoom in with alt fire, squeeze off a round with primary fire. A head shot puts your target down with one bullet.   The last weapon to put in an encore appearance is the Minigun. Works pretty much like a machine gun, with standard fire, and a faster, less accurate, alternate fire. Unreal Tournament wouldn't be much of an update without some totally new weapons, and the two new ones that Epic managed to bring to the game are going to be some of your favorites. The Redeemer fires of a small tactical nuke that will pretty much devastate anyone in the blast radius. Secondary fire lets you guide the missile to its destination. The second new weapon is my personal favorite, the Pulse Blaster. Primary fire is rounds of energy bolts shot out like a machine gun. Secondary fire sends out a stream of energy that you can pretty much use like a scythe, mowing down targets by swinging left and right.   Graphically, UT hasn't progressed much beyond the original Unreal. That isn't to say the graphics don't look great, they do. It's just that other games do look better than UT. The graphics look best on a 3dfx based video card, as they are still 16bit textures. UT plays just fine on the Rage 128 cards included with all new Macs, but on 3dfx the game just looks sharper.   Where UT shows significant improvement over its progenitor is in sound design. Unreal sounded good, but UT sounds awesome. Every weapon in the game has distinctive loading and firing sounds that you can distinguish both for yourself and your opponents. The game also takes a cue from Q3A with voice announcements that track your progress. Two kills buys you a ~double kill,~ three a ~multi kill,~ four is ~ultra kill~ and five the coveted ~monster kill.~   You can play Unreal Tournament against live players over a LAN or over the Internet, or you can play against bots. The network code for the game seems pretty good. If you properly configure the game to your connection speed, you can get pretty good results from either a 56k or DSL connection. Over 56k you tend to get more lag, but if you have a noise free line like I do, you can get your ping around 100. Over DSL, my ping never crept higher than 20 unless it was a very slow server. If you do play over the net, you can also choose to have your playing stats recorded so you can see how you compare to other players on a given server.   If you're going to play against bots, don't expect it to be easy. Epic's bot code in Unreal was good, in Unreal Tournament it is better. The bots themselves don't have all that much personality, but they definitely have distinct playing styles. Some bots gravitate toward camping, other towards a more frontal approach. More importantly, they do go for each other as much as they go for you. In team play modes like Assault or Domination, they also work together very effectively.   So far the game sounds good, but it is they way that Epic ended up putting the whole package together that makes Unreal Tournament more than the sum of its parts. The graphics, although not cutting edge, look great. Sound design is also top notch. Epic through in every type of deathmatch game known to computer gamers and the ability to extend game types to your heart's content. The levels themselves are all exceedingly well designed as well. Add it all up and Unreal Tournament is a damn near perfect game!   There are a few issues though. RAM, for one. If you don't have 100 Megs of RAM to give this game, beware. You can use Virtual Memory, but you really want physical RAM to run this puppy under or it gets dog slow. The user interface for the game is also on the crap side. Menus respond slowly and the overall design is less than intuitive. The server browser also seems pretty slow, even if you're connected over DSL.   The bottom line with this game is that Epic has created a masterpiece against which I will be measuring all other first person shooters. If you enjoy the genre, this is the must have title for your Mac.", "date": "Jun 10, 2002"}
