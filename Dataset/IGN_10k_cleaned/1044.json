{"name": "Lost Vikings 2: Norse By Norse West", "name_review": "Norse By Norsewest", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/05/12/norse-by-norsewest", "text": "Not nearly as popular as they once were,      enough 2D side scrollers still manage to get      made every year to continue the tradition      made famous by Mario and Sonic. Norse      By Norse West, the upcoming sequel to the      original Genesis game, is one such title.      Staunchly sticking to prerendered sprites      and tried and true gameplay, The Return Of      The Lost Vikings (as it is subtitled) is a      blast from the past.       The Mighty Tomator, after being defeated      by the Vikings in the first, has found our      hapless Norsemen once again. Baleog,      Olaf, and Erik are captured early one      morning while fishing, and are teleported to      Tomator's hide out. However, Tomator      suffers a total system failure, and in the      ensuing chaos, one of the Vikings misreads      a 'Do Not Touch' sign as 'Donuts,'      sending the three hurtling through time and      space. Luckily, a kindly witch offers to      help the boys get home, but only after      they've found the correct ingredients for her      spell to work.       The game focuses more on puzzle solving      skills. Each Viking has his own special abilities that the      others do not, and each one is required for      different situations. For example, in the first level, there is an opening in the side of a wall that is too small for a normal sized Viking to fit through. Olaf fortunately has the ability to 'dwarf' himself. This ability allows him to shrink, thus obtaining a key on the other side which will be used later in the game. All three must strategically combine their special abilities in order to pass each level.    Beside innovation, Norse By Norsewest doesn't have much more to offer. Sprite-based graphics are pixelated and not too appealing to the eye. Colorful sounds on the other hand give the ear an occasional tingle. But with 31 levels of this, it tends to get repetitive and almost unenjoyable after awhile.     If you like the Genesis version, then you'll definitely enjoy it. For those who never played the Genesis version, well, you're not missing too much.", "date": "May 12, 1997"}
