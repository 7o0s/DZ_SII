On the second day, God started playing Heaven and Hell, and found himself annoyed by poor game information, weak, non-existent controls and limits on his own power.  On the third day, God unleashed his vengeful side, seeking retribution on non-believers, but found that he was still hampered by the same problems.  On the fourth day, God was depressed by what he'd wasted three days of time to, and instead booted up an old copy of Populous to cleanse the bad mood from his mind.   Let's face it, folks, god games are a tricky genre for designers to create titles in because of their subject matter.  You have to establish an all-powerful, or nearly all-powerful deity that can influence and manipulate their world in numerous ways.  You have to persuade a number of denizens on the surface of the world to believe in your existence and the spectacles that you create in front of them.  Perhaps more importantly, your struggle against opposing gods has to be seen as an important life and death struggle for the souls of every character on a level.  Unfortunately, not every title designed manages to balance these facets.  Heaven and Hell from Mad Cat and CDV has the unlucky distinction of being one such title, with such limited, static action and poor controls that players will feel more like sheep instead of gods.  Sit down, my brothers and sisters, and prepare to listen from the book of IGN.   Players assume the mantle of either a good or an evil god in Heaven and Hell, fighting against the opposing philosophy for the control of a region.  Each region has a number of villages scattered across the wilderness.  Each village, in turn, has a varying level of belief in your theology; some towns are neutral, while others are heavily influenced by your opponent.  While the generic theme or topic for each stage may change, the overall goal is the same: convert every citizen to your side.  Converting people gives players mana, which acts like spiritual currency in the game and allows you to perform more miracles (which can help you convert more people, ad infinitum, in a cyclical pattern).  There's also a day and night cycle that plays a major part in the collection and distribution of mana.  During the day, the good side has a significant benefit to performing its actions, while at night the evil side reigns supreme.  Working during the wrong time of day can be rather expensive to your mana stockpile, as each action costs much more to create a change in the world.   Performing acts from on high (or down below) is a way to affect the world, but to truly bring believers into your flock, you'll need to create prophets, who will spread the message of your existence to the people.  Aside from performing menial tasks across the land for you, your prophet's main goal is to convert the nonbelievers in a number of ways, such as channeling up angels, building amusement facilities and preaching to the masses.  As people see the error of their ways and start believing in you as a god, they will return to their houses and remodel them in your image.  To make your people happy (as well as increase your chances of remaking the world in your image), you can bless their homes, which either increases the amount of mana you receive from your followers or increase their loyalty to your faith.   As I said before, mana is important to cultivate because it allows you to influence the world, but loyalty is a little bit different.  Having loyal followers means that your flock will fiercely resist attempts at being converted to your enemy's theology, even going so far as picking up rocks to stone heretical prophets from your opponent.  While having fanatical devotees to your religion is an adequate deterrent to mild incursions, you'll need to raise an army of holy warriors who will defend your people and assault rebellious citizens until they see the error of their evil ways.  In fact, unleashing a wave of these soldiers to beat and harass neutral or evil townsfolk can aid you in converting the unfaithful or bludgeoning the unrepentant.     Now, my people, time to get down to the heart of the matter, the ungodliness that made me incredibly unhappy. Once you've gotten past the basic concept, you'll quickly notice that many of the basic game mechanics are in serious disarray, which degrades any desire you might have to truly play through each mission.  The first and probably most distressing problem the game has is the numerous limitations placed upon players as gods.  Most god games slowly dole out new abilities or features as you succeed in your tasks, allowing you to amass a large number of skills to defeat dangerous opponents.  Heaven and Hell doesn't even come close to doing this, restricting access to skills or prophets that you might need without an apparent reason.    What's even worse is the fact that you only get a paltry six powers, and they are pretty weak by comparison to things you'd expect a god to be able to do.  For example, while I understand that manifesting flowers in an area is probably a way to bolster the mood of your followers just as sending a plague of beetles is a way to scare non-believers, I refuse to believe that patting a villager on the head is an adequate power no matter what the benefit is.  Since you have to pat your chosen person an extraordinary amount of times before there will be a significant effect, you might as well give up the concept of trying to govern a world and deal more with the micromanagement of people's feelings until they fully believe in you.  It's rather hard to believe that any player, much less a god, would necessarily care that much.   Another major flaw with Heaven and Hell is that there simply isn't enough distinction between the good and evil sides to warrant playing through both campaigns.  If you want to play as an evil god (as I'm sure many players would), you'll have to slog your way through the good campaign before this option is available to you, but you most likely won't want to bother with it.  Since there are no unique units to a particular ideology, once you've learned to play the good side you already know how to play the evil side effectively, which quickly becomes Boring.  Taking a cursory glance through the instruction manual helps to illustrate this point.  Both good and evil gods share the same limited, lame powers, with a few minute changes: instead of patting someone on the head, you hit them, or instead of summoning flowers you conjure skulls, but this really isn't enough to engage anyone.  Prophets on the bad side have similar mild modifications, with a slight name difference and power alteration to fit their theology.  It's as if the designers couldn't think of anything creative for either side and simply decided to level the playing field.  Sorry guys, but do hellhounds, burning hail or risen dead ring a bell?  Items like that could've made the evil side something you eagerly anticipated so you could revel in your destruction.  Instead, you're forced to stew in mediocrity and frustration.   Even odder are the seemingly illogical strong-arming tactics necessary to convert followers to your side.  To perform a successful conversion, you have to force, I repeat, force, villagers to listen to your prophet's sermon entirely.  If there is the slightest lapse in concentration or interest shown by a citizen, the prophet's attempt often goes for naught and he has to start all over again.  Since prophets cannot move once they're in the middle of performing a sermon (or a miracle for that matter), players only have two options available to them.  The first is that they continually pick up wayward villagers and drop them around the prophet, constantly patting them on the head to keep them in one place.  The second, as I stated earlier in the review, is to use your soldiers to beat the hell out of anyone who isn't listening to a sermon.  Doesn't this seem particularly intolerant, especially for the good side?  If anything, you'd think this would send neutral villagers screaming towards the opposing ideology, but for some reason these villagers have no problem having holes stomped into them, followed by a brainwashing sermon.     The sermons actually wind up highlighting another significant problem, that of prophet usefulness.  With the exception of your eulogizing and militant prophets, the usefulness of the other holy men comes into serious question.  There are a few times in which you'll need to use some of them to construct amusement buildings or roads, but once that function has been fulfilled, their value becomes worthless.  Even on later levels where more dangerous enemies are found, the prophets designed to counter them aren't worth the mana or the slightest bit of concern that should rationally be raised in the player's mind.  The reason for this is that the A.I. is simply too ineffectual, even on the highest difficulty level.  If the A.I. decides to mount an attack at all, it can be easily repelled, since it never uses powers of the opposing god against you, and telegraphs its tactics by performing the same attack over and over again.  Given the computer's main attack and civic defenses, towns can then quickly be overrun by your forces and converted to your side.  What little strategy that players would hope to find in this title quickly becomes non-existent as they perform oversimplified religious tank rushes into evacuated towns.    As much as I'd hate to beat a dead horse into the ground, I'll end with one final kick:  The control scheme leaves way, way, way too much to be desired.  For example, if you want to select a prophet, you have to left click on him; however, the game often considers such a click to be the delivery of an order or a command, which can often cause misdirected movements.  Another problem with this left click system is that once a character is selected, the game interface often stubbornly refuses to relinquish control of them, which can sometimes result in misdirected movements.  While right-clicking is supposed to release characters, you often have to press the button a number of times before you'll receive the response you want.  However, if you happen to have selected a god power beforehand, you wind up triggering the power at the same time you're intending to deselect a character.  I can't count the number of times I tried to deselect a preacher only to accidentally electrocute them or cast a plague on their exact location.   Graphically, Heaven and Hell is a colorful, cartoonish title that might remind older players more of The Smurfs or Lemmings than any other game.  Minor animations can be seen throughout the game, such as the fans that spin in mana tents or the sometimes strange little dances that your followers perform.  (Speaking of strange, for a game that seems to be based in a primitive time period, I don't understand how upgrading buildings would turn them into hippy vans, Elvis grandstands, or target ranges...maybe I just don't get it.  Anyway...) If there was an immediately noticeable problem with the graphics, it would most likely reside in the numerous frame rate drops during cutscenes, or the immense amount of slowdown that randomly pops up in a level.   Sound is something that winds up having less of an impact in this game than in other titles.  Background music is adequate, with a character that seems to fit the character of each side (the heavy metal for the evil side is a creative touch).  Similar things can be said about the sound effects, although there's not many that will catch your attention.  The one thing that stands out as exceedingly odd is the voice acting, which seems to be a poor imitation of a Monty Python episode.  Even odder, prophets will speak in proper English, but then switch to an odd Simlish if they're trying to convert someone or perform a miracle.  This will typically be the first feature that you'll quickly turn off, because it quickly becomes annoying.     There are other features found within Heaven and Hell, but seriously, they're not worth exploring once you realize how stale the gameplay really is.  Skirmish mode presents a number of maps that you can choose a side and fight over, but you won't find any new features or units presented to you.  Instead, you'll merely fight over a plot of land that doesn't really provide a challenge for you.  In fact, there are plenty of times when the computer will simply turtle in towns, preparing for its eventual demise.  The other main feature is multiplayer, but no one is online playing this game, probably because they've already returned the game for a refund.  Heaven and Hell is one of those games that tried to step in the follow in the footsteps of innovative god games like Black & White or the classic Populous, but is woefully cursed with poorly executed gameplay.", "date": "Sep 25, 2003"}
