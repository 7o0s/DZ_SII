In the case of Pokemon Pinball, Nintendo's designers have put together one of the finest video pinball games on the handheld; not only are there a good assortment of well-designed pinball tables in this cartridge, the game's ~catch 'em all~ element adds a new dimension to the pinball genre. Don't let the cute image fool you; Pokemon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire is an excellent title for all skill levels. Even godlike pinball wizards will find this game incredibly fun. Features Two separate main tables More than four mini-tables 200 collectible Pokemon Cartridge save (eight high score slots per table) Link cable support for trading Pokemon and high scores. Only for Game Boy Advance Pokemon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire isn't a generic video pinball with Pokemon creatures thrown in; the developers of this game have created two elaborate pinball ~machines,~ one based around Pokemon: Ruby Version and the other around Pokemon: Sapphire Version, that incorporate the character and personality of the many creatures in the Pokemon universe. The springy pig-like Spoink assumes the roll of the plunger that sets the game in motion. Pikachu uses his electricity to act as a channel ball-save. Grouped-together Shroomish use their bouncy bodies to act like bumpers. Giant creatures like Wailmer and Whiscash can swallow the ball in-play to activate specific items across the playing field. The boards are just filled with pocket monsters, and they've all got their own pinball-based job.  Like most pinball games, the task in Pokemon Pinball is to keep the ball alive as long as possible, and to score as many points as possible. Pokemon Pinball pulls this element off extremely well, because there are plenty of opportunities for super bonus points that can be multiplied by hitting specific targets; the point inflation in Pokemon Pinball is a little insane since high scores are literally in the hundreds of millions, but hey...ever play a pinball game that only awards ten points at a time? The eight highest scores on each of the two tables are recorded to cartridge, and players can actually link two systems and games together to trade their high score list to each other...something that increases the competition since you'll want to make sure your name appears higher than your buddy's on your own cartridge.  But high scores are only one reason to play. The main goal in Pokemon Pinball revolves around the theme of the Pokemon theme: to catch 'em all, and it's here where the gameplay of Pokemon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire really shines. There are 200 catchable Pokemon creatures in this game, and the cartridge save RAM keeps track of which creatures have been caught by the player in what's known as the Pokedex. The daunting task is, of course, to complete the Pokedex, and the only way to do this is to bring Pokemon creatures out in the open and whack it multiple times with your ball. Some creatures can only be obtained by ~evolving~ them, and this element adds an additional layer of challenge to the gameplay; even if you have a pre-evolved Pokemon creature in your Pokedex, the only way to get the evolved version of that creature is to catch it, and evolve it during the same game session. And when some creatures have as many as three different evolved forms, it's quite a feat to pull off the multiple Evolution Modes during the game to acquire the creature. On top of all of this, some creatures can only be caught in specific areas, so players will have to hit a specific target that will activate ~Travel Mode~ to move from one location to another. The designers even encourage players to link up their games with each other; if a friend caught a Pokemon that you're having a hard time finding, having his Pokedex data linked to yours will have those hard-to-find Pokemon appear more frequently in your game. There is a ton of pinball action and strategy in Pokemon Pinball, and it's this reason that makes it the best pinball title on the system.  Beyond the two main tables, players will also have the opportunity to play on several smaller, non-scrolling boards that feature specific tasks. In one, the idea is to nail a chameleon-like Kecleon ten times before time runs out; the problem: he'll vanish from sight if you don't collect a special viewing item hidden somewhere on the board. In other challenges, players will have to do battle with the Legendary Pokemon (Kyogre on the Sapphire table, Groudon on the Ruby table. These challenges are timed events...even if you lose a ball between the flippers, you're still in the game. Though these mini-arenas aren't a good substitute for additional full-on tables, they definitely add variety to the already well-designed main Ruby and Sapphire boards.  It wouldn't be a great pinball game if the physics weren't believable, but there are no worries in this department; Pokemon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire features, at this point in the game, the best pinball engine on the Game Boy Advance. The ball movements feel great in this game, and all the standard pinball tricks, from the trap to the flipper pass can be pulled off accurately. The speed of the ball roll might feel a little slow to some, even in the ~normal~ ball speed setting, but the reaction of the Pokeball against the flippers, bumpers and objects are handled extremely well. This game just feels great.  But as amazingly fun as Pokemon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire is, it's not a perfect pinball game. The game design doesn't feature any multiball mode, a standard in pinball table design; perhaps it's because the table's already brimming with action that adding a second or third ball to the mix might slow things down. Regardless of the reason, the lack of a multiball mode in a pinball game is a noticeable item, and it's a shame that one didn't make it into Pokemon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire...not even in the extra mini-table challenges. The only other issue that's a bit of a drag is a single design complaint in the Sapphire table: one target that's meant to trigger the ~Travel to another location~ mode is far too easy to hit, when it's obviously meant to be a bit more of a challenge. It actually can be hit by accident far too many times, which wouldn't be a problem if the Travel Mode didn't override any other mode that you were trying to trigger. But it does, and it's quite annoying to have to go through the Travel Mode when it was activated by accident...and it happens far too often on the Sapphire table.There are plenty of pinball games to choose from on the Game Boy Advance. But as good as those games are, Pokemon Pinball tops the bunch with not only two well-designed tables with several point-based combos to pull off, but also with its Pokemon-collecting element; catching 200 creatures just adds a whole new level of enjoyment to the classic pinball action. It's a shame that one little button location in the Sapphire table makes that layout a little more annoying to play than the Ruby board, but both designs are still well done and some of the best pinball action you'll experience on the GBA system.", "date": "Aug 21, 2003"}
