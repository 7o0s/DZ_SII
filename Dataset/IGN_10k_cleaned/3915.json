That first WWF game was thin on features and overall depth but we were smitten by the game's wrestling engine and it's potential to deliver the next great wrestling experience to surpass the N64's WWF No Mercy. Nearly two years later, Anchor brings us WWE Raw 2 to fulfill that promise.  It doesn't, but Raw 2 does come pretty close.  More wrestlers, more match types, a deeper create-a-wrestler feature and a true season mode are just what Raw 2 needed to surpass its predecessor and that's just what we're getting. Just like a roster update to your favorite sports game, the new characters added to Raw 2 are cause for the most excitement. Goldberg, Scott Steiner, Brock Lesnar lead the cast of new characters that'll have wrestling fans buzzing over this game. Where Raw 2 comes up short however is in its overall presentation, believe it or not, and its shortcomings in the audio department. Throw in a few clipping problems here and there and a season mode that's not as intuitive as it could be and Raw 2 ends up far from perfect but still very fun whether you're playing solo or with friends.  Gameplay  Between multiplayer sessions (the bread and butter of the series), the Season mode and creating your own wrestler, there's plenty to keep your busy in Raw 2 even if you think you've done it all already in the previous game.  Raw 2 uses the grappling system where the majority of moves are initiated after first grabbing the opponent. One of the nice innovations is that you move your character using the D-pad but you can instantly start running by leaning on the left analog stick. This allows for quick access to your arsenal of sprinting moves and all of your basic standing moves without fumbling for awkward controls. Other than this new trick, the controls and application of controls remains the same as in the last Raw game. The biggest difference in gameplay is in the way you'll be able to interact with objects in the environment.  Gone is the old item system where you'd have scores of obscure things like hats, fish and garbage can lids just waiting to be discovered in an equipment case and collected. There are still plenty of weapons like bats, golf clubs and kendo sticks but the silly items have been limited to a few fruits, some fitness equipment and that damn fish again.   All of the unnecessary stuff was cleared out to make way for fully functional steel chairs, ladders and tables. Like the ones you might find in a TLC match. Chairs can be used in both strike moves and in more elaborate grapple moves now. A grapple move, while holding a chair might lead to a Vandaminator or a DDT headfirst into the chair after your superstar throws it down on the mat. Tables can be opened up and set up like you might do for Thanksgiving, but they're ~functional~ in that they can be broken and will have to be broken in the new Table match. Ladders are made available during Ladder and TLC matches obviously but they can be set up in the ring and used for all kinds of aerial moves.   In a Ladder or TLC match you'll need a ladder to get the prize hanging from the ceiling but the most satisfying element of Raw 2 might be the handful of grappling moves you can pull off of the top of ladders......through tables. Chokeslams and suplexes through tables off of ladders make Raw 2, period. At times you can even go out of the ring off of a ladder and land a move but this is difficult to the point where we think it might be unintentional. But the simple fact is the addition of tables, chairs and ladders is awesome and put to great use in Raw 2.   The list of match types is so rich now that Vince McMahon himself may not even know how all of them work. The system is set up so that you choose from Normal, Hardcore, Street Fight, Ladder, Table, TLC, Battle Royal, Cage and Hell in a Cell for your match type and then you choose the number and alignment of participants. Everything from 1-on-1 with managers to Triple Threat to Fatal 4 Way to Battle Royal to 3-on-3 Tornado matches can be set up here. There are some built-in limitations like no Tag Teams in a Hell in a Cell unless it's a Tornado match where all participants are in the ring at once, but for the most part you can mix and match your matches and participants in all kinds of creative ways.     The biggest match type addition is Hell in a Cell without a doubt. You'll be able to knock down two walls to escape the cell and climb the cage to the cell's roof which and this is where the fun begins. The game even has specific special moves designed just for rooftop battles in Hell in a Cell matches. You'll have roughly two dozen flying attacks that go from the top of the cell to the floor/announcer's table that are quite amazing. We're still big fans of the ladder moves but doing a 450 splash off of a cell onto a comatose A-Train laying on the announcer's table is quite nice as well. You can even make like the Undertaker and ~chokeslam~ somebody from the roof down to the floor, even though your character actually stays up on the roof. This is very nice as well.   All of the moves, chairs, ladders, tables and cages add a tremendous amount of value to Raw 2 as a wrestling game. Like you see on the TV shows, these elements have the potential to make things really exciting. The fact that this is a videogame means you don't have to stop 'til you get enough.    Create-a-Wrestler  The create-a-wrestler mode is so improved and so deep that it could very nearly be a game unto itself. It all starts with the amount of control you have over your character's entrance (the most important part of any show) and ends with the exhaustive details you can tweak on your custom wrestler. Every color eye shadow, every taunt, every move, every combination of shirt, pants and shoes is under your control and it won't be uncommon to spend hours upon hours creating and tweaking your wrestler's look.  Constructing your own custom entrance can be intimidating at times because you control every single element of the arena except for the fans. The color of every light in the building, the TV screen itself, the duration and timing of pyrotechnics and even the Titantron display are your playthings. Making your own Titantron sequence shouldn't be underestimated. Using some other superstar's video truly sucked in WWF Raw. Now you can have your custom character in his own video with text, cool video filters and everything. If it sucks now, it's your fault.  Not only can you mimic every move, song and animation associated with every existing wrestler in the game but you can strike out on your own and use moves, costumes and music never seen or heard before in any WWF/E game. The total available moves number in the hundreds easily. The costumes with the infinite color combinations that you can create could have thousands of variations. And the music? Well, how big is your CD collection because that's what you'll have at your disposal. In fact, the greatest strengths of the create-a-wrestler (and create a tag team as well) is how well organized everything is. The system is intuitive without being dumbed down a bit. The copy and clone functions are still there and you can even created alternate costumes for your wrestler for use during cut scenes. But these will only happen in Season mode.  Season Mode  In a Season, Anchor is taking us back to the days of the N64 where you had one year to build up your character's popularity in the WWE and vie for a shot at the championship. Whether you take an existing character like Edge or your own wrestler on the Road to Wrestlemania, your job is to of course win as many matches as you can while making things as easy for yourself as possible. The system is similar to what's happening in the latest PS2 WWE game where you'll compete week to week on episodes of Smackdown and Raw with Pay Per View events every month or so. At each show you're given a menu with a full list of matches and you have the option to do one of several things during each match that you're not involved in. You can complain about another wrestler, call someone out, steal from somebody's locker, set a trap, manipulate someone to do your bidding against another wrestler, attack somebody in the locker room, encourage a fellow wrestler, fire your manager, ask somebody to be your manager, interfere with the match, rest or do nothing at all. With everything except rest and do nothing, you're risking your health because you're expending energy that you could be conserving for your next match.    These activities all come with little cutscenes with no voice or text to explain what's going on. It all ends up looking like some high tech version of Charades. Because there's no text explaining just what you're seeing it can be difficult to tell what's going on initially. Somebody walking away and throwing up their hands in disgust is usually a negative reaction so you rarely want to see that. But it also looks similar to a high five or pound when two characters are agreeing on something. The action/relationship system is so simple however that things should be presented in a much clearer way.   This is important because there are multiple levels of success for each activity and you don't want to lose health and get nothing for it. For example you can try to pull a sneak attack in the locker room against Triple H, but he may not be there, which means you've wasted your time and energy. Worse yet, if he is there and kicks your ass anyway you'll come out with even less energy. This system is what drives the Season mode and your job is to boost your popularity so that you're a major player in the WWE. One of the reasons somebody like Triple H might not respond to your challenges or even show up in the locker room when you go to attack him is because he's the champ and has a high popularity score. If  you're not nearly as popular as the characters you're interacting with, you're literally beneath them and they have no time for you. You'd best stick to the Shannon Moores and Billy Kidman's of the WWE for your fun until you've built yourself up with big victories.       Relationships are important and you'll have several ways to develop them. Encouraging and interfering in a match on behalf of somebody you like is good way to get them on your side where perhaps they'll become your manager or bail you out of a tight spot. Obviously attacking your enemies, calling out another superstar and things like that will make enemies for you but it can also make you some friends as things progress.   Season mode is also where you'll see some of the different arenas featured in the game like Backlash and King of the Ring. You'll unlock new costume options and characters in Season mode as well.   Multiplayer  You can play through the Season Mode with up to four players and the game allows for up to six wrestlers in the ring at once even if there are only four controller ports on your Xbox. In Season Mode there's a smart system that allows up to four players to hop in and choose any character to participate in the ongoing season at any time. If your buddies aren't around, you can still play and the characters they had been using (if they're WWE superstars) will carry on with whatever relationships and stats they have at that point. Very snazzy indeed.  Graphics  The character models look even better than they did in the previous Raw game from THQ. There's more detail in the faces, the shoes and everything in between. The animation on the wrestling moves themselves are outstanding, just like they were the last time we played Raw. If there's a knock against the graphics it's the hazy/foggy look the characters have. Soft bloom lighting is the hot graphics gimmick on Xbox these days and it's alive and well in Raw 2 even if it makes the wrestlers look too soft and a bit unrealistic. That and the traditional clipping problems every wrestling game has had are what really hold this game back.   The original Raw on Xbox looked good, but Raw 2 improves on the old game with even more detail per wrestler. The furrows in Triple H's forehead are that much deeper. The keloid scars on Booker T's back are as noticeable as they are on TV. Stacy Kiebler is as gangly as you'd expect her to be if you were watching a WWE show. Every character's costume has a shadow and shine to it, especially if you're talking about reflective material like leather. Skin gets shiny too and makes us thankful they haven't invented smellivision yet.   The grappling animations and other wrestler movments are extremely detailed and intricate and Raw 2 meets the expectations set with the original game. You'll appreciate these differences the most (or the least?) when you're creating your own character. The dozens of punch types like the Undertaker's right uppercut or Rikishi's thrusting punch or Austin's left hook are all unique and each comes off in its own way. You'll have to be a serious wrestling fan to appreciate the subtle differences but if you weren't a serious wrestling fan you probably wouldn't be playing this game anyway.   Remember with new characters comes new moves and Rey Mysterio, Goldberg and Scott Steiner bring plenty of goodness to the mix. Mysterio alone must have put the development team at Anchor through several emotional stages as they tried to implement his 619 finisher, West Coast Pop and other acrobatic moves. Goldberg's Jackhammer is new in the sense that it's officially his move even if a generic jackhammer move was in the original WWF Raw.  The crowds are impressive because of their excited animation, signboards and individual outfits. They're holding signs and wearing shirts that make sense for the matches they're watching, so even though the animation is limited to a little arm waving, they add a tremendous amount of life to the game. The illusion holds up well until you climb on top of the cage in a Hell in a Cell match, at which point you can look down into the arena and count the dozens and dozens of fans actually populating the stands.  Sound  Audio is the source of Raw 2's greatest strengths and weaknesses. On the one hand you've got the authentic entrance music for every superstar featured in the game and you can even import your own soundtracks into the game and use them for character entrances. All of the grunts and punches and steel chair shots sound like real thing as well. But with so much genuine WWE sounds going on, the game's lack of voices is only made more obvious. With no announcers during matches and no voice (or text) used in the season mode there's a certain hollowness to Raw 2 when you're experiencing anything beyond wrestler entrances.  Even the built-in music is appropriate with plenty of grinding rock tunes and few hip hop songs thrown in there. The whole problem with Raw 2 is, beyond the music elements of the game, whether you're talking entrance themes, your own songs or the game's built-in soundtrack, there's just not much to listen to in the game. Now that there's a referee in the game, you get to hear him count ~1,2,3~ but that's pretty much it. Lillian Garcia and Howard Finkel do a good job on the intros and hearing them call out your wrestler's custom intro name during his or her entrance is a real thrill.   The most frustrating part is that Anchor took  the time to include facial animations where you can see wrestlers' lips moving like when Rob Van Dam talks to the crowd as he makes his way to the ring. Not that you really hear him anyway on TV, but all the characters in the game have mouth animation but none of 'em makes a peep.  The sound thins out and gets a little tinny at times, but it's still an improvement over what we saw in the previous edition of the game. Raw 2 is a ton of fun when you play it with friends and damn solid if you're buddyless and still want to have some grappling fun. The new moves you get with the cage, cell, tables, ladders and chairs does take things a step beyond what the all-powerful No Mercy showed us. The gameplay and create-a-wrestler elements of the game are outstanding and make Raw 2 worth the price of admission for wrestling fans.Presentation-wise, however, the lack of text and/or voice in the Season mode, or anywhere else for that matter just sticks out like a glaring weakness. Every other part of the game is so strong that it makes big shortcomings like this all the more obvious. While Raw 2 is the best wrestler on the system, it still may not be for everybody. Casual fans will likely miss out on the depth of features once they've dropped a few Rock Bottoms and Stone Cold Stunners. But fans of the WWE will be fans of WWE Raw 2 because they pretty much have to be.", "date": "Sep 16, 2003"}
