They don't know how to drive a car.  They don't know how to vote.  They don't even know how to spell honorificabilitudinitatibus (sp?).  Some games know this, and capitalize on the stupidity of children with cheap and dirty cash-ins of licensed kids properties like George of the Jungle.  George's videogame outing, The Search for the Secret, is clunky, buggy, and tedious.  But kids won't know the difference, right?   Of course, I kid.  Youngsters are actually quite bright and can appreciate more than mindless jumping and butt jokes.  There have been several games released lately that are aimed at kids but don't insult them (Go, Diego, Go! and The Spiderwick Chronicles, for instance).  But George of the Jungle is a perfect example of a kids' game that doesn't work.  It mostly boils down to sloppy programming.  At a glance, the game looks perfectly respectable.  But when you get your hands on it, frustration sets in almost immediately.   Visually, when it's standing still, George doesn't look half bad.  The jungle is bright and colorful and everything looks very clean.  But this is not a graceful platformer.  Nothing is animated very well and the controls are very floaty.  The backgrounds are peppered with inhabitants and while they are occasionally doing something amusing, they mostly consist of 2D characters being stretched to fudge their movement.  Some objects just aren't animated, such as the trampolines that give George a boost.  And while some characters' mouths move when speaking, others do not.       The jungle is a 3D environment, but George can only move in two dimensions along a set path.  The developers constantly tease the player with paths and doorways that lead into the background, but we are not allowed to explore these areas.  This is a missed opportunity to build some secrets into the game and get the player thinking about the game world.   The biggest problem with the game is the collision detection -- or the lack thereof, rather.  This isn't a very challenging platformer.  There aren't a lot of enemies or tough jumps.  But the programming is so sloppy it renders some boss battles impassable without working around the glitches that appear.  Sometimes you will clearly hit your enemy but it won't register with the game.  The worst offense is during the level two boss fight.  In order to knock a baboon out of a tree, you have to first defeat his monkey goon.  The goon stands before a gate, but the game thinks he is behind the bars.  The result is you end up attacking him but doing no damage.  All the while the baboon boss is up in the tree draining your health.  Some finagling with the controls eventually allowed us to workaround the glitch, but this game is meant for eight-year-olds who are really going to have a tough time.   Pointless Wii Remote gestures have been implemented into the gameplay, draining the player of their dignity at every turn.  Whether you're spinning the remote to dash or waving both the remote and nunchuk like an idiot just to pull a lever, you'll find the gestures get in the way of things rather than enhance the experience.  Tutorials explaining each of these gestures can't be skipped, of course, so you'll be watching them over and over.  Good thing, too, because I always forget that trampolines make me jump high!   All of the humor is of the lowest common denominator variety.  You've got monkeys pointing at their butts; George has an annoying voice; there's a port-a-potty in the background.  The title screen inflicts a re-working of the classic George of the Jungle theme that is almost too terrible to believe.  Imagine the most white bread, Disney hip-hop you can and you're close to hearing the atrocity that is this theme song.Remember the 1997 live-action George of the Jungle movie starring Brendan Fraser?  You're better off digging it out of the bargain DVD bin than trying to play this game.  Even if your kids are big fans of the cartoon, they deserve better than this.  It's not funny and it's not fun to play.  If the developers had simply fine tuned the collision detection it probably would have been fine.  As it is, this is one bungle in the jungle.", "date": "Apr 8, 2008"}
