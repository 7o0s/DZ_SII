Batman Begins from Warner Bros. Online follows the new exploits of the Dark Knight as he comes to grips with his troubled past and hunts down the vicious Scarecrow.   Batman Begins is a classic side-scrolling action-platformer. If you've been gaming for sometime, you'll remember this genre well -- movie games like this were once a dime a dozen. This latest wireless take offers some basic action gaming with a few hints of Batman-esque flair, not unlike the classic Sunsoft Batman for the Genesis. That was a great actioner in its day, but its glory time has come and gone. As a result, Batman Begins is an average game with some nice hooks for fans, but it for a game based on an event picture, Batman Begins is uneventful.   The game is split up into five acts. Batman must hunt down members of criminal gangs en route to bringing down a greater crime ring. Batman Begins doesn't exactly reveal any spoilers, and without having a peek-see at a script, it's difficult to judge how close it hews to its source material.   There is more to do than just punching your way through levels and flattening bad guys. Batman uses a slight degree of stealth. If you can keep your awareness meter low by not being spotted, or leaving enemies on their feet long enough to sound the alarm, you can often get the drop on bad guys and bring them down with bonus stealth attacks. When thugs are horizontal, bend down and tie their hands so they cannot cause trouble later.   Batman is nothing without his utility belt, which gets some decent play in the game. You have your Batarangs for projectile weapons. Flash pellets temporarily blind enemies so you can get close and dish out damage -- these are especially helpful when multiple enemies are on the screen. You have a grappling hook that lets you access high ledges. And you can use your cape to its fullest extent to really swoop down and cause havoc amongst the criminal element.   As mentioned, the action is fairly straight-forward. Walk over to a bad guy and punch him out. Drop down behind another bad guy and punch him out. Save for the use of a few Batman-specific gadgets, there isn't much to differentiate Batman Begins from other side-scrolling action games. There are basic puzzles to be solved involving mildly tricky architecture. It's not that it isn't kinda fun -- but it's certainly a little underwhelming and uninspiring.   Batman Begins looks pretty solid. We tested the game on a LG VX8000. The Batman sprite sprite certainly looks the part, complete with cape and cowl. His enemies are all on some crazy diet, though -- they are skinny fellas. No wonder they fall so easily to the Bat. The levels are decently sized with a reasonable amount of detail. The game looks a little muted -- lots of blacks, grays, and browns -- but such is life in Gotham City.  Batman Begins is a moderately fine action game is the mold of early-to-mid-90s movie games. The pacing is a little slow, stealing some of the thrill of being Batman. I was glad to see the presence of the utility belt gadgets and that the developers stuck to the realm of reason -- no goofball gadgets. At only five levels, some players will finish Batman Begins in just an hour or so, making it a tough value to recommend.", "date": "Jun 1, 2005"}
