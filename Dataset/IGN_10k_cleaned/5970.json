Nintendo may have published the game as a first-party title, but the company most likely had nothing to do with the game's design or development. Koei, having never published a GBA title in the states, probably didn't have the resources to get the game on shelves in the US. ~Sure, we'll help you out!~ said the eager Nintendo. ~We have a gap in our schedule anyway!~ But what they got was this crappy, repetitive action game that bears only cosmetic resemblance to the popular PlayStation series. And ultimately, it's one of the lamest first-party releases on the handheld. Yes, even worse than Super Mario Pinball.   What made the Dynasty Warriors series somewhat cool on the PlayStation was its all-out weapon action, putting a single soldier against a countless number of warring enemies in a series of epic battles that take place in historical China between feuding houses. The storyline really isn't all that important, all that you really need to connect with are the variety of different soldiers you can pick and the amount of ass you can kick. The game may be a little on the shallow side on the console, but wait until you see what's been done for handheld gamers.   The Game Boy Advance game, Dynasty Warriors Advance, takes the idea of ~one man against dozens of enemies~ and waters it down to ~one man against four or five enemies.~ You've seen more on-screen enemies in Double Dragon. And for a series that takes pride in its grand scale battles, it's really silly to see such a small amount of bad guys wander around the field to battle. Granted, the game isn't exactly a push-over in difficulty, but ultimately the game simply ends up being an exercise in how long you can endure rapidly hitting the A or B button while avoiding the more aggressive and challenging enemies. Battles are in waves of five to emulate the large amount of enemies console versions of the series throw at the player, but it's almost a joke in comparison and makes managing battles that much easier since the next wave doesn't begin until the last soldier in the previous wave gets taken out.   The fights themselves aren't just repetitive in action. The battles recycle the same set of battlefields no matter where you're fighting. So it doesn't matter which end of the battlefield map you're fighting -- you'll see the same areas over and over again. This also means that power-up locations don't change either, so if you recognize the area (and after a couple of turns in the area, you will), you'll know exactly which direction to scroll the screen in order to smash the vase that hides the energy pick-up.   The game promises ~Tactical Action,~ but the ~tactics~ portion is anything but strategic. It barely reaches Uncle Wiggly in board game strategy, moving three chosen soldiers from position to position on the playfield to eventually end up in player controlled battles. Very rarely do the enemies outsmart your army, and very rarely are you ever cornered or trapped with very little room to wiggle out of.  The game's variety comes from the amount of weapons you can unlock and equip, and the different characters you can control. But even with these elements everything plays similarly no matter how you have things equipped. It's a long, extensive game thanks to multiple levels of action, but the repetitive game design will make it so you'll probably want to cut the adventure short.  So after button-mashing through several hours of Dynasty Warriors Advance, I had to ask myself, ~Is this it?~ So, I had to inquire with the PlayStation 2 crew to find out if that's indeed what the series is all about.~Pretty much,~ is what they said.Dynasty Warriors Advance is dreadfully dull action on the GBA that truncates and abridges the over-the-top, crowded weapon-based brawler action established in several PlayStation 2 titles. But on a system with very few action buttons in an engine that can't represent the congested battlefields of the console versions, the game design just doesn't work on the handheld system. And it'll make you wonder why the series is so popular to begin with.", "date": "Aug 29, 2005"}
