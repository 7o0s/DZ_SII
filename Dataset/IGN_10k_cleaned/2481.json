They didn't just dig around for any old classic old NES title to resurrect and remake in 3D form. What they did was revive the kind of crucial gaming experience that's been lost, sidelined, forgotten, and perhaps even hastily brushed aside as the world steamrolls into its 3D future. Maximo isn't just a game, it's a testament, a 3D eulogy to old-skool games at their very best, a conscious decision to rekindle the...~glory,~ if you will, of the relentlessly hard, unforgiving, but insanely rewarding action-platform games from the NES and Super NES days. Maximo: Ghosts to Glory revives a notion, and Capcom Digital Studios has conspicuously brought back the design, simple story, reward and difficultly level of the Ghosts and Goblins and Ghouls and Ghosts series, with all of their very best -- and worst -- qualities intact. Yes, those games were mean, tortuous, and unforgiving to say the least, and Maximo can be just as cruel. While Maximo: Ghosts to Glory is a great action-platformer, to be sure, it has its share of problems, many of which sprung from those old games.  But let's get one thing straight, Maximo: Ghosts to Glory, in the year 2002, is a magnificent game. It's a wonderful treat that will have you shouting at the TV in anger, cursing puny pigs wielding giant hammers of destruction, and jumping with excitement at having beaten a boss or a mere single level. It's full of wonder and fury, encompassing the whole gamut, just like a good game has always done, and always should. GameplayMaximo: Ghosts to Glory is the kind of action-platform game that every console system used to have and still should have in its library. From a parents' perspective, Maximo appears like the kind of game that kids used to play on their ~Nintendo.~ It's safe in the way that games once were, with ~tame~ themes and cartoonish graphics. The story fits in nicely with that ~kiddy idea.~ There's this warrior named Maximo who leaves the kingdom to fight some noble cause in a foreign land and when he returns to find the king dead, he discovers the kingdom's right-hand man, Achilles, has taken over. Naturally, as this  clichd story always goes, Achilles also has stolen Maximo's girlfriend, the princess, and now Maximo must save her and restore order to the kingdom, all by his lonesome. Adding cool diddies to flush the story out, Maximo is instantly killed by Achilles, and descends into the realms of hell, where the Grim Reaper makes a little deal with him. See, Achilles has learned that mining the earth for souls has gained him tremendous power, and the Grim Reaper, feeling a lot worse for it, wants his souls back. Giving Maximo another chance and his life back, the Grim Reaper sets Maximo back on earth to be all he can be -- to rescue the five sorceresses, stop the mining, to kick Achilles butt, and to get his girl back in the sack. From there, Maximo whacks and jumps his way through five hub areas (each with about five levels), confronting six bosses, and collecting spells, weapons, Koins (coins) and more on the journey of about 15-20 hours. When he finally beats the evil Achilles, he ~gets his girl,~ (you have to play the game to know what I mean) and the game is over. The levels include some pretty standard  clichd levels (that are nonetheless still awesome to play), including The Boneyard (a graveyard of sorts), The Great Dank (a swampy area), Graveyard of Ships (an icy, pirate locale), Realm of Spirits (basically this is Hell), and Castle Maximo (a rank old castle). The thing is, Maximo is just the kind of addictive, challenging game that glued gamers to their systems and TVs for hours, days, and weeks on end as they tried to master the game, collect every item, and to explore each last nook and cranny. It may seem safe on the outside, but it's not entirely so on the inside. To put a point on it, Maximo makes you work for everything in it, and work you will, my young friend. But enough of that ~hard~ stuff. The game is designed with both linear and free roaming qualities, starting off easy and increasing in difficulty. Players start the game in Boneyard, and can travel to any one of the five or so levels in any order. Once they're all beaten, access to that level's boss is given. Another single hub is opened, and you repeat the process, until all five are opened. Design-wise, it's classic stuff. Maximo perfectly balances combat with collecting, exploration with action. As a 3D game, Capcom Digital Studios has created a very good world, one with controls that are near pixel-perfect in precision, one that's followed by a third-person perspective camera with a decent effect, and one that is colorfully populated by a world of happily annoying skeletons, zombies, pirates, ghosts, yetis, satyrs, evil mages, and more. With the camera, by tapping L1, players reset the camera behind Maximo. Using R1, players can see from the first-person perspective. While these aspects help players see their way around, the camera is surely the weakest aspect of the game. It requires players to manually re-adjust in tight situations. And when a sliver of life is left and you can't see an enemy coming your way, it seems unfair. This could have been improved with a quicker automatic system, one that waits fewer seconds to reset behind Maximo, or to enable players to see from more (higher, etc.) views. It works well enough, but I also died too many times because of the camera getting in the way, and that's not good. Concerning the control, the game re-creates the precision control required to beat a quick, timing-specific action game. Maximo is all about utilizing quick reflexes and executing perfect timing, and being exactly where you need to be when you want to be there. The precision is right there in the game, begging for you to acclimate yourself to its system and then master it. I don't feel that the controls in any way need to be fixed or changed. Additionally, I don't have a problem with the little things that may bother other folks. In fact, I enjoyed them. When Maximo's sword sticks into the woody walls, I smiled as he used his foot for leverage to pull out the sword. When he ran into small, narrow caverns, I used vertical attacks, avoiding the useless clang of the sword on the rocky walls. When I lost my last little inch of health and had to start over from the beginning, I thought to myself, ~Damn, I have to get better,~ instead of thinking, ~Man, this game is cheap.~ And I did get better and learned to use the weapons, magic and items, to my benefit. Maximo's save function is organized with one major save point for each hub (world), and two to three RAM-based (i.e. temporary) checkpoints within any level. Players collect two items for health and life, Spirits and Death Coins. Spirits are little blue sprites that can be collected by hammering away at certain locations in each level. Collect or more and you earn one Death Coin. Players also collect lives, represented by hearts. Death Coins are large brown coins that Maximo hands to the Grim Reaper after losing all of his lives. The Death Coins, naturally, are harder to collect. What's a little tricky also is that the more you die the higher the price of life is. As you progress you'll pay more Death Coins to get your life back. Even though the logic is a little screwy -- the worse you are the harder it becomes -- the object is once again to improve your skills, the unshakeable basis for the game. Though it may seem odd, Maximo shares an incredible likeness to Gran Turismo. Yes, it does. In GT, you must shave off tenths of a second to beat your previous time to earn that gold medal. You must learn to drive better each and every race, taking turns with more perfected angles, and learning the courses with relentless practice. Maximo is the similar. You need to learn how to attack, when to block, and how to anticipate the enemy's patterns. You must manage the allotted amount of health given to you. And if you suck, you must practice more. It's classic game theory. If your skills grow more masterful, you succeed, plain and simple. The only thing is, Maximo isn't very forgiving. Unlike, say, Jak and Daxter, which is very forgiving, this one ain't. You have to earn everything, and usually, in the later levels, you must play the game nearly perfectly. But, with a little hindsight, if you compare the game to Ghouls and Ghosts, or Ghosts and Goblins, Maximo is SO MUCH EASIER than either of those games that it's uncanny. Back to the attack system and weapons for a second. Maximo can attack with his core weapon, block, jump, double-jump, double-jump and attack, throw his shield, and cast spells. Players begin with basis attacks and as they proceed, they find items or grab them from dying enemies. He doesn't swim or hang or fly. It's all about attacking, blocking, and jumping, baby. The weapon/attack system is simple enough. In the lower left-hand corner of the screen are three circular icons, filled with a variety of weapons; as you find new weapons, icons representing them appear in the circles. Players always have three basic circles that can't be removed. As you progress, however, you earn new circles, increasing to as many as six or seven in the end. In the upper left-hand corner are your health and power meters. The way to play Maximo is to find and use the many different sword and shield powerups as possible, of which there are a decent amount, and to know when to use them and when not to. Some of the special powerups include Flame Tongue, Shock Wave, Frostbiter, Pure Blade, Armageddon, and Sword Change. Some shield powerups include Iron, Silver, Gold, and Shield Charge. Maximo also finds various kinds of armor, including basic, full (with helmet), and Gold (which lasts for a fleeting 20 or so seconds). Also, if you get super whacked, you'll be reduced to walking around in your boxers. Nice.The only other weakness I found is with the bosses. The trick isn't beating them; it's finding their weaknesses. Once the single weakness is found in any of the bosses, they're simple. I mean, after the treachery of getting to the bosses, you'd think that the bosses would present an equally consistent battle. I guess I should careful what I wish for, especially knowing Capcom's tendency to create sequels, but if the save function were a little more friendly (as in providing the ability to save before fighting a boss automatically or something), then hardening up the bosses would be welcome. Another thing I noticed about them was that they decreased in difficulty as I progressed through the game. For instance, the third boss was far easier than the first boss. Strange, but hey, less dying in the long run is a good thing, right? All in all, Maximo was a pure joy to play; like eating cotton candy for the first time, a sugary delight. GraphicsCapcom's newest action-platformer is created to look cartoony, and its medley of locales, -- levels that include ice, pirates, cemetery, castle, swamp, and hell -- all do a stellar job of looking clean, different, and amusing. Modeled on characters and lands created before, Maximo has a distinct look about it. The characters are super-deformed, from Maximo to the sorceresses he must rescue, to the enemies themselves. To see a super-deformed skeleton or satyr is quite a humorous experience, and these characters are both cute looking and annoying in behavior, creating in players a quick love/hate relationship. And they are given the bulk of the textures (rather than the backgrounds). Maximo himself is nicely detailed, and when he's fully armored, he's finely decked with a load of polygonal objects, and well textured to boot. But still, the worlds are artistically textured. The levels are textured with all sorts of great designs, and for example, the swamp level and the hell level, though again both still simple and cartoony in design, are bountiful with texture variety. In the swamps, ferns and plants move as you pass through them, and the polygonal walls look verdant and lush. In the hell level, the craggy caves, the bouncy brains, and the structured towers and stony faces are just great. Actually, in the ice levels, the pirate ships sticking out at odd angles from icy hillsides are nice to view, but one level in particular looked just great. Of course, the name of the level escapes me now, but it includes a swirling whirlpool of purple water, with a spinning pirate ship in the middle, surrounded by icy mountains, a gleaming low sun, and beautiful skies. It's polished looking and nicely devised. In fact, I would go so far as to say that Maximo looks just short of gorgeous, boasting an eclectic array of textures for each level. And his animations, while simple, are great, In fact, while Maximo's animations are good, they're not quite as amusing as the enemy characters -- which are damn hilarious. It's just a style really, but everything is created with a touch of humor, perhaps tongue in cheek, in some cases straight-out silly, but always with a chuckle. The pirates in the ice level say the standard things that pirates are supposed to say, ~Ay! You scurvy dog!~ But they say it perfectly. And because they have a sword stuck into their chests, and when they fall over, they are skewered to the ground like a live bug on a pin, wiggling around helplessly. When any castle guard is doing his routine animation, he whistles happily, about facing every 10 steps or so, but when he sees you, he hops around like John Belushi from Animal House. In the ice level, when the yetis take the final blow, grab their crotches and fall down in comic fashion, flat as a board. The game, which moves at a constant 60 frames per second, only did a decent job with other areas, such as fire and water. The fire is standard looking blurry stuff, and the water is also very basic, with no real substance in its look or motion. The particle system is flashy and noticeable, especially with blasts coming from your sword, enemies dissolving, and bombs being thrown all the time. Last, the CG needs work. Most games on the PS2 don't even use CG movies anymore because the PS2 engine generates enough polys and textures to create excellent looking in-game cutscenes. The difference between Maximo's in-game graphics and CG is huge. It looks like two different games, almost. What's more, the CG work is not up to the current levels of CG work. Ah well, luckily, there really isn't that much. SoundWhen it comes to sound effects and music, Maximo is proficient in its musical score, and is as funny with sounds effects, specifically the enemy characters, as it is with its animations. There really isn't much dialog at all, and the bulk of sound effects are from weapons clanging or from specific weapon effects, such as spells, and whatnot. Maximo has what seems like less than five sound effects, one yelled out when he performs a jump attack, a second when he dies, a third when he picks up a new life, and another when he's surprised. He may wield a big stick, but he's essentially mute. When it comes to the music, the score is carefully crafted to use the most memorable riffs from the original games, but the team has created new music around those themes to bolster the repertoire. It's good action-game arcade music, and there isn't really a better way to describe it. The music is catchy, fast, a little vaudeville-ish, and repetitive, and I have grown to not be offended by this kind of music. In fact, after years of being blasted by videogame music, this is a good thing. And, I never grew sick of it. The music always remained enticing and engaging.This is where I tell you what I really think, but I'm certain you already know. Maximo is a pure delight to play, and anybody who tells you differently is a stick in the mud, or just doesn't like old school games. The fact of the matter is, there isn't much wrong with an old concept reborn in 3D. Especially, when the developers are as erudite as these. The folks working at Capcom Digital Studios know their old games like masters. They have distilled the very essence of the old series and brought them wholly intact into the 3D world almost as well as Miyamoto did with Super Mario 64. It's like they revived a lost art, or finally remembered what some many people seem to have forgotten. Those 2D games were fun as sh*t, and bringing them into the 3D world with new challenges, enemies, and worlds with the tenacity, vigilance, and passion that these guys did is a remarkable step. My hat is off to you Capcom Digital Studios, for a work well done.", "date": "Feb 13, 2002"}
