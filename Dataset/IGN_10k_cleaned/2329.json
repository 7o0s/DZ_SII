Well, with a name like Hero, you gotta be an adventurer, right?  As Hero, you'll travel across Dokkano Island, battling and capturing monsters, finding new weapons and shields, and learning powerful skills to aid you in your quest.  Features 150 monsters to battle and capture 120 weapons and 50 shields at your disposal Innovative battle system Link cable support for two player battles Battery save Only for Game Boy Advance Dokapon uses a unique and interesting battle system.  As you'd expect in an RPG, creatures wander the dungeons you explore.  You can attempt to avoid them or suck it up and meet them on the field of battle.  Before each battle begins, you must choose between two face-down cards.  One will be a sword, the other will be a shield.  If you guess right and pick the sword card, you will get to attack first.  With the shield, you start out on the defensive.  The combat system is based on the old game of rock, paper, scissors.  You have four choices on both offense and defense.  You can choose a straight attack with your basic skill.  This will always do some damage or, on defense, offer some protection from any attack.  If you want to get risky, you can choose to use a rock, paper, or scissors skill.  The results are like the game of old: Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock.  If you pick rock and your opponent picks scissors, you nullify their attack or defense.  If you pick the same skill (rock vs. rock) you cancel each other out and choose again.  If you pick rock and your opponent picks paper, they beat you and you have no defense against their attack.  This mistake can prove very deadly.  Lastly, if you pick rock and your opponent chooses to use their basic skill as a defense, you will do some damage to them, but not full damage. AIA has tried a new approach to RPG combat, and for that they get a kudos from me.  You are either going to love or hate the rock, paper, scissors format.  It was nice to sit down and find something new in an RPG combat system.  It doesn't add a lot of depth to the turn-based system, but it does give a new wrinkle.  I liked it in this game, but I don't think I'd want a lot of RPGs to come out with the rock, paper, scissors shtick.  Combat becomes a guessing game and guessing wrong can get you killed in hurry.  Dokapon forces you to develop strategies in combat, to take away as much of the guessing as possible.  The more battles you participate in, the more developed your strategy will become.  Certain creatures tend to use the same skills.  So if you notice a creature is often using their rock skill, you'll defend with a paper skill to nullify their attack.  Of course, creatures switch up their attacks, but those are the risks you take.  To make it even more interesting, your rock, paper, and scissors skills can be more than just flat out attacks or defenses.  You can have a rock skill that will increase your defenses, or a scissors skill that will put your opponent to sleep.  Each weapon and each shield has a basic skill and one rock, paper, and scissors skill.  There are 120 weapons and 50 sheilds in the game.  Weapons can be different swords, clubs, axes, and even a water gun.  The shields are just as varied.  When you beat a monster, you gain experience for your character as well as for the weapon and shield you're using.  Your character gains levels, but so does your weapon and shield.  As your weapon and shield gain levels, you will learn new rock, paper, and scissors skills.  Your weapons and shields can only have one of each skill.  So to learn a new skill, you'll have to abandon an old one.   That's kind of a drag, because you are limited to only three unique skills for a weapon or shield.  There would be times when I would have my favorite skills and would just ignore the option to get new skills when I leveled up.  That sort of goes against the idea of building up a weapon.  However, many of the weapons can be combined to make unique weapons not available in the dungeons.  It's a give and take.  You are limited in the number of skills you can have, but there's a huge variety of weapons to be had.  Your goal in Dokapon is to gain a triple-A rank as an adventurer.  After completing your first mission, you will become a licensed adventurer.  From there, you will take missions from the All Adventurers Association, or 3A.  There are a ton (and I do mean a ton) of missions to go on.  Dokapon will last a while just attempting to find all 150 monsters and complete the slew of missions available.  The dungeons are randomized, so you never enter the same one twice.  Most dungeon levels are small and never overwhelming.  By pressing select you can see a map of the areas you already visited.  This is a nice, helpful tool to make sure you leave no stone unturned.  Monster ranching is the name of the game in Dokapon.  To nab a monster, you'll need to lay out a trap in a dungeon.  You can include food in the trap to help entice the little critter.  Once the beast is caught, you'll have to fight it to win its loyalty.  You can take up to four creatures with you to the dungeons, the rest must remain on the ranch.  Be warned, if you have four creatures with you, you won't be able to nab any more.  So, if you want to go monster hunting, make sure to leave yourself at least one open space in your party.  Your ranch can only hold sixteen monsters, meaning you can have a total of twenty captured at any time.  This is a bit of a drawback because you can't ~catch 'em all~ in Dokapon.  Despite this, the monster ranching is simple and the monsters are very helpful in battle.  It's nice to have a ranching game where your character is a part of the battle and you're not just sitting in the background watching the fight. Dokapon has some odd quirks that stick in mind.  Have you ever played an RPG and wanted to attack the shop keeper rather than pay them?  Well, this is an option in Dokapon.  Yeah, you go to the weapons shop and you can buy, sell, or attack.  It's not as peachy keen as it sounds.  The ~attack~ is really a rock, paper, scissors battle.  If you win, you don't have to pay for the item you take.  If you lose, you are tossed out of the store and the coppers come after you.  After they trounce you soundly, you'll wake up in the church, minus all your items, weapons, and gold.  This is what Dokapon is all about.  You take your chances and get modest rewards or suffer serious penalties.  Another of my favorites is when you, an eleven-year old kid, go into the local pub.  Talk to one of the girls wearing a playboy bunny outfit (really, she's got the ears and everything!) and she notes how cute you are and follows you around the bar like you were the lost Backstreet Boy.  Damn, why wasn't my childhood like this?  Dying in Dokapon sucks.  If you bite the big one, you are transported to the church.  You awaken with no money, no items, and your dinky first level sword and shield in hand.  Ouch.  You lose everything you were carrying.  Remember that your weapons and shields gain levels as you adventure.  You may still be eleventh level, but your sword is now level one again.  A harsh, harsh punishment.  The only way to spare yourself from total ego deflation is to stash weapons, items, shields, and cash at your house before you go adventuring.  Make back-up weapons and shields incase you lose out in battle and end up losing your main forms of attack and defense.  Oh, and since your sword and shield are first level again, you lose the skills you learned with them.  Perhaps over this holiday weekend you heard an anguished scream echoing through your neighborhood.  That was me after losing my eleventh level sword and shield.  One tip: Don't die.    If you have a friend (or can afford to build a robot to pose as your friend), you can link up GBAs and battle each other in the arena.  You can fight for items and weapons or play it friendly and get your confiscated weapons back at the end of the battle.  You can also exchange items and weapons.  Battles against a friend, with the stakes being each others equipped weapon and shield, can get intense.  If you heard a second scream echoing in the night, that was me losing my twelfth level spear and shield to my pal Marcos.  The characters in Dokapon are nice and big.  The level of detail doesn't reach Golden Sun proportions, but they are very fine indeed. The character designs are fantastic.  I love the cartoony feel to the characters and the animation.  Throughout the game you can discover new outfits for your character.  I'm trying to remember an RPG where you had a variety of outfits to wear.  The many creatures you encounter are distinct.  There's slime, bats, and even crazed miners.  The only letdown is the near static combat.  There's little in the way of battle animations, though there are a few nice skill effects.  The stationary feel can make battles get a little tiresome and slow.  I was still addicted enough to play, but I found myself sighing sometimes in the midst of a conflict.  If you're looking for a classic RPG with an epic quest to save the world, Dokapon is not for you.  But if you want to try out a very unique combat system that offers hours and hours of gameplay, Dokapon is worth picking up.  The penalty for being beaten in combat is too severe when you consider that it's not all that difficult to die in battle.  All it takes is facing a tough opponent and choosing a rock defense when they use a devastating paper attack.  You gamble and lose big time.  I took twice my max hit points from one such attack.  Yeah, that was the third time you heard me screaming in the night.  Like a lot of RPG gamers, I like traditional RPGs that have a linear story with grave consequences (complete your quest or the world dies).  Dokapon does not follow the traditional format, and that will leave some gamers dissatisfied.  But for others, it might be a nice change of pace.", "date": "Nov 29, 2001"}
