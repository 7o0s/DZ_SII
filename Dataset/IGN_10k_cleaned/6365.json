Uprising-X is a still first-person strategy game that requires mind over twitch, but the laser-beam focus of the game now targets blasting and strafing and mixes up its mission objectives better than ever.  In uprising-X you are a futuristic marine commander sent to lift up a rebellion whose central weapon is a stolen piece of technology named the Wraith tank. The story is merely a backdrop but creates a war-torn environment and mood that gets you revved up to topple the all-dominant Imperium forces. Your Rebellion forces have fought a battle in which they believed they won, but were mistaken, and in several of the 12-plus levels, you will occasionally join with Xaja forces to fight and reclaim land on several planet surfaces.   The levels vary little in the beginning, which is fine, since the game controls take time to get accustomed to. They're not difficult by any means, but to really kick ass, you'll need to learn the difference between switching weapons from switching infantry or tank units in mid-battle. That's where the superb training levels come in. You're directed by a high-strung military leader whose hilarious over-the-top voice sounds like it's from Small Soldiers, and who leads you through all of the game's deepest insights, controls, and features.   The game's level design was clearly generated from the mind of a sci-fi maniac who wanted to use a fast-moving tank all his or her life. Uprising-X is first-generation PlayStation game in concept with the complexity of a third-wave game design and control. Your Wraith tank can travel over lava (with slight damage), ice, watery patches, and up relatively steep terrain. The terrain is sloped and undulating, so you never get stuck in a 90-degree angle corner -- thankfully. The levels range in look from volcanic areas to ice-based terrain to tropical and mountainous environments.  In most levels, you establish a Com-Link and Citadel, a large control tower that enables you to create factories, set up bases, and create turret support. Like the PC game, you can elevate up into the Citadels instantly and view the world from a Statue of Liberty point of view, looking down on enemy tanks or into the cockpits of oncoming aircraft. From this perspective, you can create infantry, aircraft, and Wraith factories, run by computer AI, and fight off enemies with a mean laser shot.  Uprising-X is also a viable two-player game with a variety of levels to engage in. The designers at Cyclone obviously have a sense of humor. Not only did they bring in that silly commander voice, but they also wanted you to have fun in multiplayer mode. There are three modes, Challenge mode, Siege mode, and Death Match, and the funniest is the Infantry Crush. In a Wraith you can run over military men, and in this level your aim is merely to crush (appropriate sound effects included) as many army men as possible. It's a blast. The other scenarios balance between citadel defense, Wraith vs. Wraith, and Death match, in which is a free-for-all shoot out.   Uprising-X supports both analog and dual shock technologies.I was put off by this game's look at first. It's not high-resolution and it's relatively middle-of-the-road in looks. But after playing through the training mode and then plowing through my first three levels, I was hooked. The level of strategy is never as great at a game such as Starcraft, but that's OK, cause Uprising-X balances out strafe-blasting action with deployment strategy and hunt-and-search missions. The ability to deploy units and use the Citadel point of view for firing and troop and vehicular creation is especially cool. It adds depth and variety from what could have been a rather boring shooter.I particularly like the variety of levels, which range from straight-out shoot-'em-ups to rescue missions to deployment heavy strategy battles. Add to that the death-matches and great sci-fi mood of the game, and you've got a great PlayStation game. All in all, Uprising-X is a title that'll sink in deep after a few levels, and make you want to invite your friends to come over and play on a boring Friday night. Uprising-X retains the crucial PC elements that made it so much fun, and injects action and military might in a PlayStation style that make it a hardcore gamers' delight.", "date": "Dec 17, 1998"}
