{"name": "NIBIRU: Age of Secrets", "name_review": "Nibiru", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/22/nibiru", "text": "Now, let me say that I've had a pretty long relationship with the adventure gaming genre. Things have been a little difficult lately, but I still recall the good times with The Secret of Monkey Island, Maniac Mansion, Space Quest, The Longest Journey, back in the old days. Things have been picking up lately, with Indigo Prophecy and the recent Myst games, but there are still some throwbacks.   Nibiru in particular is not only a throwback but an actual remake of a title that released only in Poland back in 1998, by the same guys who did Black Mirror. The pedigree is solid. However, the sense of unease begins almost immediately. Maybe it has something to do with staring at the back of the main character's head for several minutes as he goes back and forth non-interactively with someone else. This wouldn't be so bad if the voice acting was good, but our hero, Martin Holan, globe-trotting academic extraordinaire, sounds like he's spent a little too much time narrating episodes of Wild Kingdom. His voice is very practiced, his lines very rehearsed, and his engagement in the material apparently negligible. It certainly sounds like he has a lot of experience, just not with voice acting. He also has some Canadian pronunciations that the player might find jarring.   While Martin Holan is perhaps only guilty of canned emoting and being from the Great White North, there are invocations of French and German accents which are either intentionally comic or originating from deep pockets of their respective countries that I wasn't previously aware of. And there is a royal buttload of voice acting to sit through (and I say ~sit through~ because you have no dialogue choices to make -- you must simply sit and listen to them talk, sometimes interminably, looking for things you might need to jot down for later reference, as there will be no text log or summary of whom you've talked to or the highlights of the discussion).   All right, so with that out of the way, what's the game like? Well, it is thankfully relatively puzzle-light, until the end, where you may find yourself resisting the urge to impale a bystander with your keyboard in a rage of agony. Don't get me wrong -- puzzles aren't necessarily bad. But Myst ushered in a generation of needlessly arcane and time-padding obstacles from which the genre never quite recovered. Most of the intentional problems you'll be dealing with are unaccommodating people and blocked passageways. And the solutions are typically both intuitive and creative. Typically.     In practice, one problem stands out. I had to get past a guard into an office building. I had some firecrackers on me that I'd basically stumbled onto by walking to the end of an alley. Now, reason dictates that you could simply light the firecracker, throw it behind the guy, distract him with the explosion, and slip past. Unfortunately, the solution was a little more complicated. If you don't want it spoiled for you, skip to the next paragraph. First, I had to talk to a former guard. You can't tell he's a former guard because he looks like an old man on a park bench feeding some pigeons. You also can't tell he's a former guard because he either can't hear you or won't talk to you. You have to find those firecrackers and throw one at him, at which point he becomes quite talkative (where I would have punched the guy who did that, and stolen his wallet for good measure, but never mind). After several minutes of poorly-paced conversation, consisting of one uninteresting camera angle like most of the other poorly-paced conversations, it eventually turns out that this former guard can help you get past the current one. He has a pass, but of course he won't just give it to you. He likes wine. Thankfully, there's a kiosk not far away that sells all kinds of convenience store-type things. But they only sell cheap wine, and you need nice wine. Thankfully, there's a homeless guy nearby, surrounded by empty bottles of wine. But you can't just take one or buy one. You have to barter it for a pack of smokes, then empty the cheap wine into the nice bottle, then go back to the old man, then get the pass, and then finally get past that current guard. A process that could have taken five seconds now takes maybe ten minutes of figuring out arbitrary game designer decisions, and you're finally through one of many intricately orchestrated hurdles.   I don't mind figuring out problems that a game sets before me. But I dislike it when I have to divine the answer through exhaustive process of elimination creates the bulk of the gameplay. There's also the issue of a game being perceived as automatically more intriguing because it takes place in exotic locations and populates itself with ambiguous totems of power. I do like how they blended Nazi conspiracy, extraterrestrials and ancient civilizations believably, though, but watching a lot of X-Files probably predisposed me to that. Either way, the audience this game is pitched to should have few problems with suspension of disbelief. Well, except when it comes to those outrageous French accents.The game certainly looks nice, for its part, having been given a complete facelift from its 1998 release. Character animation is a bit stiff, but it's not really that distracting. Sound is a little sparse, and there's some pretty effective mood music here and there. Those looking for a classical approach, with a little pixel hunting, inventory item combination, sliding puzzle pieces and globe hopping, will probably find themselves at home with Nibiru, if they can look past the sheer dullness that takes over as soon as the characters launch into one of their many conversations. For me, even as a traditional adventure game, it had a little too much pixel hunting and arbitrary solution paths. I think the genre has evolved to a much more compelling plateau.", "date": "Sep 22, 2005"}
