{"name": "Kartia", "name_review": "Kartia", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/11/24/kartia", "text": "With incredibly intricate strategy RPGs like Tactics Ogre and Ogre Battle under its belt, Atlus attempts something a little different with Kartia, a slightly more ~mainstream~ title within the genre. The context that the term ~mainstream~ is used within to describe Kartia draws more from the game's similarity to Final Fantasy Tactics more so than Atlus' other strategy RPGs. With characters recognizably designed by well known Final Fantasy series artist Yoshitaka Amano as well as CG cinemas and a stellar soundtrack, Kartia feels and plays like Atlus' pitch at the big time. The end result is a game filled with clever features, an involving storyline, and an innovative system for weapon and magic creation.   At the outset of the game, you'll be given a choice of which character you'd like to play through as; either the pious daughter of a high priest of royalty or as a free knight searching for his purpose. Each story has its own separate set of characters, a completely different series of battles, as well as a unique ending. But the really interesting feature of the storyline is the fact that both of the individual stories eventually cross over at some point and each main character will have a good deal of interaction with the other. This feature is well executed and serves to draw the player deeper into the world of Kartia.  The name Kartia is derived from a deck of cards used by the characters in the game. The cards provide resource in the form of useful materials (water, food, etc.), but can also be used to create labor (called Phantoms), develop varying degrees of magic, or fashion powerful weapons and armor to be used in battle. Throughout the game, you'll collect different types of cards which can then be combined with others to reach higher levels of creative abilities. This feature lends the game a very customizable feel and provides a superior amount of flexibility in battle to upgrade every aspect of your units. While the Kartia system itself can be initially daunting, the process slowly becomes enjoyable and one of the unique high points of the game.   Battles take place on a somewhat large scale, allowing you to use a good number of Phantoms. The Phantoms are split into three different classes, each with a weakness to a particular opposing class, increasing the level of tactical challenge to a new level, without overwhelming the newer player with the usual cumbersome act of constant stat-checking. Another interesting feature of the game is the player's ability to use magic spells to transform the battlefield. Actions such as raising or lowering the ground, freezing over patches of rivers or burning fields of grass can give your battle unit a strategic advantage during combat and doing so will greatly vary the conditions of war. But, again, the intricacies of battlefield tactics never feel overbearing in light of the refreshingly simplistic combat interface and the easy to follow logic of most of the commands.   Overall, Kartia may not be an incredibly long lasting title with countless hours of replay value, but it does show that there are more companies out there with the vision and talent to pull off a solid and involving strategy RPG. If you're a strategy junkie or a fan of FFTactics and Tactics Ogre, this game is definitely up your alley and won't disappoint.  Francesca Reyes", "date": "Nov 24, 1998"}
