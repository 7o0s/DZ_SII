This Taito-developed shooter, adapted from an arcade source, was originally a Zapper-compatible title when it came to the NES in 1989. So unless you have the peripheral and find yourself using just a controller to play it be warned: No solution was ever introduced to simulate the old NES Zapper, no extra programming or effort was made to make it play more like the way it was originally intended. Unless you're one of the lucky ones who still have the light gun, Operation Wolf is a Zapper game without the Zapper.   Sorry man, no help for you. You're stuck in Operation Wolf. You can still play Operation Wolf, of course, but you're forced to use the D-Pad. Doing so gives you command over an on-screen targeting cursor, which you'll have to sweep back and forth across the screen to line up with the enemy soldiers, tanks and helicopters seeking to take you out. It's functional, but it's not any fun.   Because the cursor's movements are imprecise and frustrating at best, and you simply can't move the reticule as quickly and accurately as you need to in order to clear out all the many enemies swarming the screen at once. With the Zapper in hand, all it took was a quick wrist movement to target any position on the screen -- with the cursor, you have to wait for the graphic to travel the full length of the display ever time you move from firing at something on the left to firing at something on the right.   And who even knows what you're firing at? Operation Wolf's 8-bit visuals are horrendous, with muddy, indistinct backgrounds layered behind stiff and lifeless enemy soldiers. Your foes blink with a white light when they're about to fire at you, giving you some time to counterattack before their bullets or grenades hit you in the chest, but good luck keeping yourself alive when five different guys are all set to blinking in different corners of the screen simultaneously.   If you manage to survive and progress from one stage to another, you'll find that Operation Wolf actually does have a workable plotline in place about a band of commandos raiding an enemy concentration camp in World War II and trying to free hostages imprisoned there. But that aspect, as with every other, worked much better in the game's original arcade edition. There you could select which of the game's six stages to play first, and the challenges in other levels were determined by the order in which you tackled previous levels. Here the order is determined and linear right from the beginning, eliminating yet another potential positive point that this game could have had.Operation Wolf was well worth the drop of a quarter in its original arcade form, as it featured a large, cabinet-mounted replication Uzi as a controller and had a lot of personality as a result. But when Taito began to port the game to countless different home systems in the '80s, it lost a lot of its appeal. The NES edition was crippled in its visuals, in particular, and seemed disappointing in comparison to the coin-op version.And now that same NES edition is crippled even further if you don't have the light fun somewhere. With just a standard controller, Operation Wolf just doesn't work and never would without some sort retcon programming. Stay far, far away.", "date": "Feb 12, 2008"}
