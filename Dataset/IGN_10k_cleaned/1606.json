While not the visual tour de force like some other first person shooters (i.e. Unreal Tournament, Quake III Arena), the multi-player features, unbelievable realism, and the astonishing attention to the details (this is a game based off the Tom Clancy novels, you know) made this one of the most popular PC titles.  So, with the Dreamcast's PC portability, Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear would be a natural selection, especially since the Dreamcast has online capabilities right?  I mean, the key to Rogue Spear's lasting appeal on the PC is the multi-player aspect... so, you're probably wondering how many people can play online with the Dreamcast version of Rogue Spear.  Well, time to take a walk down disappointment boulevard, cuz you won't find any online features in the game.  This is a heavy blow to an otherwise solid game featuring a satisfying one-player experience, good visuals, and a above-average deathmatch mode.  The Dreamcast version of Rogue Spear is, mission for mission, identical to the PC version.  You're part of an international anti-terrorist group named Rainbow Six, as you go throughout the world defusing explosive situations.  And preparing for each mission was always enjoyable because there's so much planning and customization that can be done.  Before you actually start a mission, you begin with a debriefing of the situation that also details your objectives.  From there, you can pick up to 8 members for the mission, each with their own specialized skills in assault, recon, demolitions, lock-picking, aggressiveness... the list goes on.  It would've been cool if a ~create your own agent~ feature was included here, but I digress.  Anyways, after selecting team members, you get to grab the toys of the game  weapons.  The weapon selection is pretty keen, though you won't find any BFG's or Redeemers here.  All weapons and items are based off real world equipment, and believe me, what you use can make a serious difference.  Then comes the planning stage of you preparation, where you plan out sweeping routes, patrol paths, and team formations, complete with a map of where your team will be inserted.  If you don't like a particular path route or you think that a certain part of the map would be a better waypoint, then change it!  After all this exhausting preparation is completed, THEN you finally get out and teach some terrorist better manners.  This might sound a bit too much for those that won't a simple frag-fest, and if that's all you want don't get this game.  Rogue Spear is all about getting waist deep into the realistic activities of anti-terrorist countermeasures and tactical espionage action.  This is not a man's first person shooter... it is a civilized tactical action game, where regardless of what kind of armor your wearing, one well-aimed shot from an enemy and BANG!... you're dead.  Action sequences occur in 3D power, and while the visuals are a bit dated in comparison to current first person shooters, it definitely above average.  However, I question the frame rate that can chug to the point where you can actually count the frames per second.  However, the game wasn't made to be a roomful of flashbangs, and rather concentrates on the realism of character animation.  And in that area, you'll be quite amazed at some very realistic animation when enemies get shot.  Textures can be quite bland at times, especially with mountain snow levels, where every turn looks like a path you've taken before.  Once again, the name of the game is realism and from that train of thought, Rogue Spear does a good job of looking and playing the part.  As said above, this isn't a game where you can take 3 shots from a rocket launcher and come out with a slight limp.  It's all about realism and careful planning in Rogue Spear... oh, and it helps if you've got steady hand as you'll find sniping plays a very useful role in the game.  The missions usually revolve around saving hostages, bomb disposal, or my personal favorite, elimination of terrorist influence.  There are no items to pick up, no heath packs to heal you, so if an enemy gets off one shot, you'll be lucky if you're still standing.  Of course, you'll be able to toss out such useful items as fragmentation grenades and flash bangs to help you out... and your team members are pretty damn good shooters in their own right, so they'll cover your ass when you forget.  The engrossing story only enhances the one-player experience, as you'll be dropped in some very cool setting that include an Opera House, the battlefields in Kosovo, and even in a 747.  Yes, playing the one-player game is definitely a satisfying experience, though make sure you have a keyboard and mouse.  Though the game features a number of configurations for your Dreamcast pad, playing with a pad blows.  Rogue Spear is a game about accuracy and precision, and no matter how good you are with the analog pad, it can be quite a frustrating experience.  Then comes handling inventory, team commands, and other options, all of which rely on the D-pad.  Pressing down on the D-pad will bring up a menu selection where you can change what items your using, team commands, zoom, and crouch. Problem is that until you play the game a number of times, you'll be busy reading the menu layout when you really should be worried about the guy running down the hallway with an M-16 aimed at your chest.  Though there's no way around it with a D-Pad and I'm sure with practice you could get used to it, get a keyboard and mouse if you plan on playing Rogue Spear.  While the online play feature is a sore spot, it's worthy to note that the deathmatch mode is actually pretty good and maintains a surprisingly smooth frame rate.  Still, one of Rogue Spear's greatest strengths was its multi-player abilities, and without that, Dreamcast players are left with either playing split-screen deathmatch with pals and the one-player game.  And that's not bad at all, since the one-player game in Rogue Spear is fun and challenging.  But in the long run, you can only shoot so many computer opponents, yell out so many of the same orders to the your computer controlled teammates, and play though the same missions for so long.  --Anthony ~Lone Wolf~ Chau, IGNDC There's a sizable portion of the GBA audience that's mature enough to appreciate this title. Ubi Soft's really counting on the 13 years and older gamer to drive sales. I recommend the game to anyone who's notcompletely put off by the complicated control scheme. That even includes people who played the PC version. This is such a different take on the game that it seems really fresh.Sure, there's a bit of frustration here and there and the controls are (necessarily) complicated. But overall, I keep coming back to Rogue Spear to play it again and again. It's not the ~Shut down your wholelife~ kind of game like Advance Wars or Golden Sun but it's easily one of the most intelligent GBA titles I've played yet.On a final note, the game comes with a small poster advertising Ghost Recon on the GBA. Since the levels in that game are much more open than those in Rogue Spear, it'll be interesting to see how Ubi Soft handlesthe translation. Hopefully they'll approach the project with the same originality and faithfulness apparent in Rogue Spear.", "date": "Dec 7, 2000"}
