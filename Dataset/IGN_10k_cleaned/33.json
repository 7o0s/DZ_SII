If you're not familiar with the World Heroes franchise, you're looking at a set of old, 2D fighters that feature a variety of ~heroes~ from across the ages. I should point out right away that if you're a hardcore World Heroes fan who doesn't own all the games in the series, this collection should suit you just fine -- especially for under twenty bucks. Otherwise, fighting game fans should be wary of this anthology.   The premise of the series is pretty straight-forward: Dr. Brown has created a time machine and has gathered together figures from throughout history to compete in a fighting tournament. While the characters aren't entirely representative of historical facts (of course), most of the fighters you'll be able to select are based on actual people. You'll find Hanzo Hattori, Rasputin, Joan of Arc and even a carbon-copy of Hulk Hogan in this roster. Throw in a demonic football player and an overweight Viking and you're good to go.    In terms of gameplay, the World Heroes titles offer a familiar assortment of normal attacks and special moves, all executed with classic combinations of d-pad rotations and button inputs. If you've played a fighting game before, you'll recognize all the formulas at work here and there isn't really anything special being brought to the table. Now, that isn't necessarily a bad thing -- a lot of old fighting games are still a blast to play, a fact clearly proven by the continued popularity of games like Street Fighter II. Unfortunately, the World Heroes games haven't aged particularly well.   I'm not going to claim that this franchise is entirely without charm. Its age does give it some personality and the ability to play as ~historical~ figures is pretty amusing, but I just wasn't entirely invested in the controls. The first World Heroes is definitely the worst of the bunch, with poorly animated sprites, limited move sets and laughable translations. Although some issues are addressed in the subsequent iterations, a lot of them stick around. The sprites never really get more detailed or fluid than the content you'll see in the original World Heroes. This is a shame because other old series, like Art of Fighting for example, boast some striking animations for their time and that quality just isn't present here.   But again, visual elements aren't the primary concern. The games in this collection handle stiffly at best and certain special moves have questionable command recognition. Dashing is mostly absent from the series, though certain characters have dashes in the later games and the final title, World Heroes Perfect, does implement a full dashing system at least. But even though there's so much potential in the premise of playing as historical fighters, I feel as if the series doesn't fully take advantage of that in terms of the character move sets. Special techniques lack that ~oomph,~ that visceral sting that typically make them fun to pull off. There's something intrinsically satisfying when you execute Robert Garcia's Ryu Geki Ken in Art of Fighting 3, whereas Hanzo's Lightning Slash just feels unexciting. During my time with World Heroes Anthology, I couldn't stop thinking that the entire franchise felt lackluster.   Is it? World Heroes Anthology functions well enough and is obviously a fine collection if you happen to be a fan of the franchise (though there's little to no bonus content to speak of). I was pleased that there was a new Training Mode included in regards to all four titles, but that's about it. I'm not personally fond of the franchise as a whole and find it to be stiff and unrewarding. If you have a hankering for old-school fighters, I would strongly recommend SNK Playmore's Art of Fighting Anthology or even the less enjoyable but still preferable Fatal Fury: Battle Archives collection. Leave World Heroes for the hardcore fans.", "date": "Mar 17, 2008"}
