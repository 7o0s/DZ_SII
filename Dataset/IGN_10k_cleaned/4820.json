{"name": "I, Robot", "name_review": "I, ROBOT", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/07/03/i-robot-3", "text": "It is now a common practice to have movie-based games out day-date with the summer film they're based on -- but in the realm of mobile gaming, it seems a week or two early doesn't hurt. Mobile Scope's I, ROBOT hits carriers shortly, giving wireless gamers a chance to slip into the shoes of the always affable Will Smith (whatta cut-up!) and Sonny, one of the robots in question.   Features:   Based on the new movie  Play as Del Spooner, Sonny, and Dr. Calvin   I, ROBOT follows the basic formula for a summer movie-based game: action-oriented side-scroller. Like Van Helsing, Around the World in 80 Days, and others, I, ROBOT is a run from left to right (and sometimes back again) experience filled with plenty of enemies to punch or shoot.   You begin the game as Sonny, the NS-5. Trapped in a futuro-house of other meanypants NS-5 units (you know they're bad because they glow red). You must punch these 'bots to the ground, ride elevators, and collect Nannites. In later levels, you are Del Spooner (Will Smith's character), running through a similar-looking building shooting up bad robots. As Dr. Calvin, you cannot really attack other robots -- you use stealth tactics to hide in doorways.   I, ROBOT is by no means a bad game -- but it's just not a terribly ambitious one, either. Offering three characters to play as, each with different combat mechanics is a good push, though. Missing stealth with shooting certainly never hurt Sam Fisher's portfolio.   But the combat itself is somewhat difficult to get used to. As Del Spooner, you have a gun, so you can at least attack from a distance. No such luck with Sonny, who is programmed to only punch and kick. You can guard, but that's not much use when two robots are bearing down on you from each side. You will take damage. And more than likely, you will fall several times.   I, ROBOT weaves the movie's story in with the game pretty well. Since we have yet to actually see the movie, we can't exactly make a judgment on how close I, ROBOT sticks to the script, though.   The most disappointing aspect of I, ROBOT has to be the cookie-cutterness of it, like it rolled off an assembly line alongside the millions of NS-5 robots. Sure, this summer's batch of movie games is way better than the 2003 crop -- but now we seem to have an action side-scroller formula that is ~thisclose~ to getting dreadfully dull.   Mobile Scope and developer DC Studios did get access to a lot of the movie's assets, such as graphics and story. As a result, I, ROBOT looks pretty solid. Its color palette is limited to cold grays and blues -- but that's what the movie looks like, too. The animations are decent for such small sprites -- far better than Van Helsing, but not as good as Gameloft's Splinter Cell.I, ROBOT is a solid game -- but I cannot help my disappointment with playing yet another side-scroller action game based on a summer movie. Its like Ocean is back in business. However, I, ROBOT does try to infuse a few different gameplay styles -- and players can unlock a handful of small mini-games. If you end up being a fan of the movie when it comes out, I, ROBOT may be a great download for you. But without the potential excitement of the source material behind it, I, ROBOT ends up being just a pretty good game.", "date": "Jul 3, 2004"}
