Whereas many action and shooter games provided players with health and power-ups to heal their wounds and carry them from level to level, Red Storm Entertainment developed an intense and visceral experience where one well-aimed bullet could end a character's life. And once dead, that player would not coming back from the land of tulips to fight in later missions.   Rainbow Six offered an unrivalled gaming experience that relied on sound planning, smooth execution, and quick thinking in the line of fire. And the multiplayer facet was irresistibly  habit forming. I can't tell you how many late nights we spent playing after an ~hour-long~ LAN game that turned into all-night office deathmatches. Since that time, other multiplayer games like Half-Life and Tribes have stole some of Six's original thunder, but that hasn't prevented gamers from salivating at the arrival of the new mission pack. And for good reason.  John Clark, former Navy Seal, CIA agent, Rainbow Six commander, and all-around bad ass, is back at the helm overseeing each mission and providing intelligence info... as well as his patented droll pre-mission ~pep~ talks. There are five new venues/missions based on real-world locations:  Operation Little Wing  The Russian space shuttle Buran, located at the Baikonur Cosmodome in the Republic of Kazakstan, has been seized by BOTHRA (Brothers of the Higher Realm Army) terrorists disguised as construction workers. There goal is simple, to purify Islam through violence... oooookay. One scientist and two construction workers are being held hostage  in the shuttle pad. There's only one narrow way into the pad, and one way out -- in a body bag. Because of the way the structure stands, lead teams were unable to place heart-beat monitors in and around the locale. It's up to Rainbow Six to improvise.  Even for you battle-weary veterans, this level is a bitch. The ascending walkways and steel framework create a ton of nooks and crannies, perfect for concealing the slew of expert marksmen. However, once you find the shortcut to the pad, it isn't difficult to get in and out with the hostages before your double latte waiting for you at the drop-off point gets cold. Of course, those new Starbuck's thermal mugs help... but I digress.  Once the baddies are fertilizing the Rainbow Six garden, it's time to pack it up and head back to base... but not for long.  Operation Sapphire Rising  A radical Sikh separatist group has stormed India's Taj Mahal and is holding visiting tourists hostage inside the revered landmark. As if holding innocents at gun point isn't enough, they've also planted a bomb which will be detonated if an effort is made to free the hostages. So, just save the hostages and diffuse the bomb, right? Suuuuuure.  You and the rest of the team start the mission from the top of the Taj Mahal during an ironically beautiful sunset or sunrise ... I couldn't tell which because I traded my watch for a gorgeous floor rug at the Kazakstan bizarre after the first mission. After picking off a few enemies on the top, you enter a fairly straightforward route into the heart of the mausoleum of the mughal Empress Mumtaz Mahal (a.k.a. the Taj Mahal).  A few runs at this mission and you'll have the hostages chowing down at the Agra Marriott tandoori buffet in no time. But, as a famous ~Yogi~ once said, ~It ain't over 'til it's over.~   From a downward vantage point, you're able to fire at the terrorist on the first floor assigned to set off the bomb. He's hard to hit, but your firing will subdue him into a kneeling ~surrender~ posture. Hmmmm ... getting blown to smithereens doesn't unnerve him but getting shot at does. Thank goodness for small miracles.   Operation Lion's Den  Irish terrorists known as NOMAR (National Organization of Military Armed Resistance), have stormed the British Parliament, and guess what, they've taken hostages. These terrorists are crack shots. In fact, they can shoot you through solid structures while avoiding taking damage themselves when fired upon at point-blank range, with the firing reticule tattooing their forehead ... but we'll get into that a bit later.   The first few moments of this level are harrowing. Three guys come at you from different doorways, and can off the entire team before you can say 'Irish Spring!' If you survive the initial onslaught, making your way up the stairwell to the clock tower where the hostages are being held is a piece of cake. Well, a piece of cake PACKING LEAD anyway.  Once you're up in the tower that houses Big Ben, that's when the real hell breaks lose. The terrorists are in well-concealed positions, many from high vantage points which eliminates the use of frag grenades and flashbangs. Not only are they hot shooters, but they've got enough body armor on to stop a train. Just when you creep your way around a wall to gain a precious but hairline view of a tango, BLAM ... you're wiping gray matter off your lapel and mumbling something about Otter Pops before the lights go down on Broadway.  And there I go forgetting to mention the bomb again. Only this time, you don't have to diffuse it ... go figure.  Operation Red Lightning  Kang revolutionaries, a Chinese Muslim ethnic minority, have -- get ready for this -- kidnapped tourists in the Forbidden City. They've got the hostages in three separate locations around this monument and don't mind taking them out if an effort is made to rescue them. The Chinese government has asked Rainbow Six to handle the situation. Successfully completing this mission could be a huge factor in improving diplomatic relations. And if that isn't incentive enough, there's a great dim sum restaurant that closes in half an hour.  At first, it seems the spread-out hostage locations are going to pose a problem. But starting at one end of the city and sweeping across proves to be effective and relatively easy to pull off -- easy that is for the world's best antiterrorist group.  The textures and backgrounds of the Forbidden City are quite stunning and the best among the new missions. If it wasn't for the fact that several innocent lives were on the line as well as your team, many with spouses and cute children, you could just wander around the modern-day museum and soak up the scenery. It's almost a shame to smear this aesthetic treasure with unadulterated carnage. Hey, the terrorists started it...  Operation Eagle Watch  Those crazy ~commies~ (see Karl Marx, World Book Encyclopedia, any edition published after 1848) are back at it, stirring up a ruckus at the US Capitol building. The Red Sun Brigade, formed from the Japanese Communist League and led by Fusako Shiboto, has seized the Senate Wing. On the bad side, they've planted a bomb and have two hostages. On the good side, one of the hostages is a senator. The group wants to overthrow the Japanese government and initiate world revolution.  On a personal note, if I were a Japanese communist who found myself in a PC game, I'd have seized that gorgeous pagoda that always gets destroyed in Godzilla movies. If nothing else to save on air fair.  This final level is amazing looking as well. Though the colors aren't quite as vibrant as the Forbidden City, there is a nice variety of rooms, including record-keeping libraries, offices, and the main hall. The level is quite large and survival largely depends on patience more than guts. Don't be mistaken though, the tangos are more dangerous than an intern in a blue dress.   New Characters  Eagle Watch adds four more specialists to the R6 roster. Like the original crew, each character has his own strengths, weaknesses (and I use the term lightly), and areas of specialization. You'll recognize these names from the actual Rainbow Six novel on which the game is based: Louis Louiselle, Homer Johnston, Dieter Weber, and Eddie Price.   Price is my personal favorite. He's a rung older than most of the team members but he's still in top physical condition and there's just no substituting for experience.  Even though his pipe-smoking habit following each mission tipped off the former KGB agent of the existence of an international anti-terrorist group which almost lead to total human annihilation in the novel, the guy has style. I regret that I lost Eddie during Operation Sapphire Rising, ~Oh darn, I think I left the lights on in the jeep! Be a dear Eddie and go check, will ya?~    New Weapons  What would this game be without weapons? Probably just a bunch of really tough good guys getting picked off like clay pigeons. Fortunately, your team has access to the full Rainbow Six arsenal in addition to some new firepower: two new primary and one secondary weapon.  You've got the H&K G36K Assault Rifle which fires delightful 5.56mm rounds capable of penetrating most body armor; the H&K G3A3, the most accurate of the weapons, and the Desert Eagle .50 pistol --  packing this sucker could have people mistaking you for the stunt double in Boogie Nights.   New Training Levels  I wish they would have had these training levels in the first game! There's no better way to hone your skills than attempting to get through the new hunt ~training~ areas -- Double Kill House Hunt and City Street Hunt. You've got to can 30 terrorists to successfully complete the mission. Once you go through the intensive training, you're well prepared for the real missions that lie ahead. I actually found these new training missions more grueling and mentally taxing than the actual missions themselves!   Special Single Player Feature -- Full Watch Mode  There is a brand new feature Eagle Watch adds. From the execute screen, you may select the Full Watch Mode. This enables you to follow a team's actions from their perspective but you're not actually participating in the mission itself. This is a great feature enhancement to the first game. You not only get to mastermind a full plan utilizing all team members (in the original R6, you had to lead one team), but you still get to call Go codes, and watch the action unfold!   Multiplayer Games  R6's multiplayer capability is what gives its replay value an A+. No two missions are ever the same when the human factor is involved. Capitalizing on this fact, Red Storm has wisely added six new multiplayer modes:  Scatter Mode  As the name suggests, team players start off in different positions which eliminates friendly fire escapades and encourages more advanced team tactics like working together from various positions.   Assassin Mode  Each team starts with a single noncombatant, the General. He can be escorted around but is unarmed and helpless. When he gets capped or you cap the other team's general, game over.  Terrorist Hunt Mode  You must contend with the other team as well as terrorists. To win, you have to kill half the terrorists, but watch out for that other team!  Save The Base Mode  Infiltrate the enemy team's base, diffuse the bomb, and it's Miller time. If it were that easy, I'd have sign up as an antiterrorist a long time ago.  The two additional modes are Scatter Assassin and Scatter Team Terrorist Hunt which combine the best (or worst depending on how you look at it) of two respective modes.   Only A Little Of Six Sucks  There are a few points of contention. Honestly, I don't know if these same problems existed in the original game -- I might have been in too much awe to have noticed. But like watching a movie you love over and over, the mistakes eventually surface.  During Operation Lion's Den in particular, the tangos were able to position themselves just outside an entry way and blast my team, even though there was no direct line of fire. Lucky shooting? Well, the luck only runs one way. Return fire rarely hit the target, even at close range. Also, while your guys are getting picked off one by one, the remaining team members just stand there without doing anything -- not exactly what you expect from seasoned commandos.   And in the clock tower, forget it! About ten times, I ran into the same guy who kept firing down on my team. I returned fire only to find my bullets hitting the walkway. This same fluke happened whenever similar barriers existed.  Firing at the enemies' legs proved more successful in taking them down than head shots.  In fact, one time I shot around a terrorist and he kneeled in submission. Assuming I couldn't trust him to stay docile, I pulled out my secondary weapon at point-blank range to finish him off. Three shots later, he was still alive. Granted he had soiled himself, but that only made the killing harder! My recollection is that in the original R6, both bad and good guys could take a few limb shots without keeling over but one head shot meant instant demise.  Full Watch Mode also gave me some problems. I tried it a couple of times and each time the team leader got stuck at a barrier. And I'm not talking an impenetrable barrier, I'm talking a door frame, and the door was open! These are solders that would cut off their own fingers to use as bait on a weekend fishing trip, and they get stuck banging into an open door frame. Since you don't have any control over the team leader, you're forced to start the mission over.  Another problem involved the frag grenades. When the heartbeat monitor picked up a tango around the corner, I'd pull out a grenade, and ricochet it against the facing wall so it would land in front of the terrorist, but the team and I were not in line with any possible shrapnel. The explosions often took out and/or injured two or more team members. Again, I just don't remember that same problem occurring in the original.  Aside from those few minor quibbles, Mission Pack: Eagle Watch is an awesome addition to the original game. I would like to have seen more than five new levels, but with six added multiplayer modes, gamers will hard pressed to complain about the circa $20 price tag. The truth is that we just want more, more, more Rainbow Six.  -- Mike Lohrey", "date": "Feb 11, 1999"}
