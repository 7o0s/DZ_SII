The greatest varminters walk as gods above oceans of lowly mortals. Varmint hunting commands discipline, respect, patriotism, dignity, divinity, and resolve. Varmint hunting is a sport in which titans of athleticism drag immense weaponry around open plains tracking and then systematically obliterating small, infectiously cute animals such as Prairie Dogs, Groundhogs, Pixies, Coyotes, and possibly a few distinct races of fairy. Every single day these men and women are all that stand between us and the elite soldiers of Satan -- the varmint.   Well, Varmint hunting is America's hottest form of recreational activity that involves a high powered rifle pointed directly at the face of a tiny rodent anyway... Same diff, right?  Given how popular shooting living things is, it's with little surprise that we find ourselves examining this, the second varmint hunting title made available for PC. At least, this is the second known to man. If any others were conceived (by devil or demigod), chances are good that what passes for justice in this universe would have had enough, ripped its blindfold off, and pushed each and every one into a black hole along with other manifestations of pure evil -- Nell Carter, namely. It seems two is the universal limit. Should another Varmint Hunter release, make like the lemming and run full speed toward your own end.  For the unprofessionals among us, varmints are pathetic fur balls that barely qualify as animals and are not to be confused with realer beasts like tigers and dogs and unicorns. They just weren't envisioned by the creator of all things to hang stuffed over mantles in prolific hunters' cabins; they have heads the size of peaches and cute little ears. Why shoot something that's roughly five times larger than a bullet, anyway? Would you fire an artillery shell at a cow? It seems a bit impractical to gun down sixty prairie dogs to make one poorly strung together throw rug that hardly challenges even the worst material The Gap has to offer. Seeing as how there's no trophy to gain from killing varmint, someone came up with the grand idea of assigning points to the cheeky buggers. Basically, if you kill something that's far away, you get points. If you kill something that's really far away, you get more points.  That was the beginning and end of NRA Varmint Hunter. Kill self in... 3... 2... 1... Now.  I Nailed that Son of a Bitch!  Real varmint hunting is apparently far more involved. Just reloading a gun is a complicated affair. And to think, we always believed you just had to make sure no varmints were shooting back at you before you started tossing extra rounds into your barrel. The actual process is something more like:  Five steps of the NRA Varmint Hunter Reloading Procedure: Select Cartridge Type. (This needs to match the rifle you want to make cartridges for) Also select the number of cartridges to reload with these settings. Your used brass will be resized to your chamber and any old used primer removed automatically during this step by your resizing die and press.    Select the bullet box to draw from. The bullets shown will match your selected cartridge type and the boxes of bullets you have previously purchased. Heavier bullets will tend to start slower (slower ~Muzzle Velocity~)  but will usually retain their velocity better as they fly down range. Through testing, you may find that your rifle provides the best accuracy when using a particular weight of bullet.    Select the powder container to draw from. The powder containers shown will match your previously selected cartridge and bullet selections, and feature the powder containers you have previously purchased.     Select amount of powder to load. Each powder will provide a different amount of energy to the bullet (changing the muzzle velocity achieved) per grain of powder used, and the ~burning rate~ of the powder (how fast it burns) will affect the precise profile of the waves of pressure that the bullet rides down the barrel. This will affect how your barrel will vibrate during the shot, and determine the accuracy you can achieve.     Select the ~Seating Depth~ - how deeply to seat the bullet into the cartridge. This determines how close the nose of the bullet will be to the beginning of the barrel's rifling grooves as it sits in the chamber.  The two actual steps to reloading in NRA Varmint Hunter that all potential varminters should adhere to are: 1) Make sure you have shot. 2) Press the ****ing R key to reload, dumb ass.  More scrutinizing players will realize that in addition to shooting things both close and far and reloading, the game also sometimes necessitates that other buttons be pressed. There's the tag me some varmints button, the binoculars, the laser sight, and the minor adjustments button. Need something else? How about a ham sandwich? Too damn bad. You get varmints and you'll choke on them and like it.  Oh sure, you can get crazy and start reading about powder types, powder charges, seating depths, bullet types, and optimum dimension matching chambers, but once you've realized that spacebar shoots, the mouse looks, and the R button reloads, you've pretty much got NRA Varmint Hunter in a bag.  The biggest objection I have with the game, aside from it being roughly on par with a facial performed by a living urinal, is that you can't even move. Remember the other Varmint Hunter we mentioned? Want to know how exactly one goes about in creating a title three years after the release of a 1.2 rated game and yet still manages to come out with something more horrible? Easy, take away the ability to freaking move. NRA Varmint Hunter proves that some videogames can be outclassed by potatoes.", "date": "Jan 29, 2005"}
