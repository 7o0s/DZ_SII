Every game released under this brand thus far has been tight, well-designed, and just plain fun. Now EA has taken on the motocross genre, but given it the Big treatment, to good results. What is Freekstyle like? It's like SSX with a mouthful of gasoline. It's an arcade-style motocross game with an emphasis on freestyle tricking, balls-out attitude and a good dose of humor.   The best things about Freekstyle are its sense of speed and sense of style. Like Sled Storm, Tricky, or even the original SSX, Freekstyle is a fast game. But unlike the icy-slick feel of SSX and Sled Storm, Freekstyle both feels and looks gritty. The sensation of riding the bike is fast and rough. When you wipe out, you really feel it. When you take a jump perfectly, you feel that too. There is a good rhythm to the experience, helped by the game's consistent frame rate and great handling of vibration.   There's also a great aesthetic here. It's like someone went crazy on this game with a tattoo needle. The menus, tracks and riders are more tatted up than Korn and the Jim Rose Circus combined. While this could have been corny and weak, it's handled with enough humor and style to avoid being obnoxious.   If there's a problem that Freekstyle suffers from, it's de ja vu. The same thing that happened when Tony Hawk blew up. Since the formula worked, every other extreme sport was made into its own franchise, with mixed results. Freekstyle is a tight game, but it does still feel a lot like games past (especially Sled Storm and SSX Tricky), so if you've had your fill of racing/tricking extreme sports hybrids, Freekstyle has little more to offer.  Gameplay Freekstyle is a motocross racing game, at its heart. That means long tracks, hairpin curves, big jumps and big air which affords you the opportunity to pull massive tricks. Racing and tricking are equally important, and there are modes specific to each. Bust the Freestyle track to perfect your tricks and combos, or Freeride through already-unlocked tracks to perfect your times. These are the ~free~ modes in the game. The heart and soul of the experience is Circuit Mode, where you'll have to battle through the ranks and unlock new courses and challenges. Circuit Mode is a combination of the different disciplines: tricking and racing, and it's the key to new rides, new riders and a whole lot more prestige.   That's single player. Multiplayer has two modes: Head to Head and Countdown. Of these, Head to Head is the old standby. Countdown Mode is a race against the clock. Race, trick and bust your opponent's chops in order to earn points to keep yourself alive. The multiplayer modes are fun, but the Circuit Mode is better. Still, if you have a buddy over and want to play a fast, punked-out game, this one will do better than most motocross games on the market.  The first thing you'll notice about Freekstyle is that it's super-fast. We've already commented on this a bit above, but it's worth another mention. The speed, in this case, is what makes the game a lot of fun. What kind of motocross game isn't fast? A bad one. In addition to being speedy to begin with, the game allows you to take speed to the next level. You have to trick to get turbo, and once you trick enough you can earn a super-boost called a Freekout. All this adds up to one thing: adrenalized speed. Speed X 10. Hauling ass, as they say.   The control keeps up, too. It's quick and responsive, easy to pick up and (as the ad folks like to say) tough to put down. Part of the reason the game is addictive is the tight control. The easiest way to say it is that you feel in total harmony with the bike. It's not that there isn't a learning curve: you'll still have to figure out the best way to take jumps, when to boost and how to trick to avoid bailing. It's just that you don't have to struggle against the control. It's all right there for you.  If you're used to SSX, the trick system will come easily to you. It uses various combinations of shoulder buttons in order to fill up on turbo. If you do a medley of tricks, or perform series of tricks in a combo, you fill a separate meter. If you completely juice this one up, you'll be able to work toward a Freekout, a mind-blowing four-button trick that stretches the bounds of sanity. Land a Freekout trick successfully and you'll stay in a zen state of boost, clipping along at a blistering pace (in full motion blur) until you either can't pull more tricks or until you crash. Mastering the Freekout is key to the game, and to get there, you'll need to master the trick system.  The learning curve is decent, even for seasoned gamers. You won't be able to pick up the game and dominate it right after you bust it out of the carton. It takes a while to learn the trick and combo system,  and extensive tracks. The tracks are really, really long, too, so there's a lot to learn.  That's actually one of the slight downfalls of the game. Each lap could be its own race, but there are three per contest. Then you have to contend with three races per circuit, which makes for a long experience, indeed. If you lose in the final lap of a race, it hurts a lot. It's alright when it happens once or twice, but if you consistently get beat heading toward the finish line, the length of each race might deter you from playing again.  As I stated earlier, the main downfall with Freekstyle is that you've likely already played this game in a different context. It's less of a motocross sim and more of an SSX clone. It would sting a lot more if this game wasn't fast and polished, but the fact remains that this concept is nothing new.      For those motocross fans out there, Freekstyle has an impressive lineup of stars that include real motocross riders and lingerie models (Leann Tweeden). It's a good mix of personalities and body types, and each rider has a signature slate of tricks, bikes and outfits. While there could have been more diversified tricks across the board, the variety of other goodies available makes up for the difference.  The riders are:  Mike Metzger Brian Deegan Leann Tweeden Stefy Bau Clifford Adoptante Mike Jones Jessica Patterson Greg Albertyn  One last thing. EA has done a beautiful thing here, and it should appeal to anyone who has ever used more than one memory card (read: any PS2 owner). There is an option in the game to merge User IDs. This allows you to basically join two separate user records   Graphics The most impressive thing about Freekstyle's graphics is the frame rate. It keeps up with the rugged action quite well, and really contributes to the overall sense of speed. There's nothing worse than a slow, choppy racing game, and this one is neither.  Apart from framerate, however, the graphics are nothing groundbreaking. The whole new metal aesthetic is cool, what with all the tattoos, dirt and grease, but once you get past that, you're left with a pretty average-looking game. The rider models and animation are decent, but nothing we haven't seen from games like Sled Storm, or even NBA Street. The trick animations are well-done and distinct, and the general flow of riding looks good as well. The wipe-out animations are probably the best. You really feel the pain when your character overshoots a jump and catches a steel bar to the windpipe.  All told, these elements are there to serve the game, and don't detract from the experience but don't add much, either.  One thing that impressed me was the size and scope of the levels in the game. These tracks are long (maybe over-long), and are very well put together overall. There's a killer draw distance. You actually see looping segments of track far in the distance that you'll be riding on later.   The overall level designs and themes were cool as well. The Gnome Sweet Gnome level was a cool concept, with topiary mazes, garden gnome obstacle course and odd animals made of shubbery. In practice, it was not as impressive. The textures were a tad weak, here. The ground texture was distracting. There are white flecks (that look like those tiny marshmallows in hot chocolate) imbedded in the mud texture, put when they go by at high speed they make the level look flickery. In fact, the environments could have benefited from better textures throughout. Some looked bitmappy and nondescript, others were just bland. The game probably couldn't have run as smoothly with better textures, so it's one of those ~cake and eat it~ situations. Still, graphics snobs will not be singing Freekstyle's praises.   Fortunately, effects help to spice things up. There is a blur effect used whenever you use your turbo, and that helps add to the sense of speed. Some may consider the blur effect overkill, but I didn't tire of it. There's also an accompanying burst of flame from the tailpipe whenever you hit the boost, and this looks great. Actually, there are a lot of fire effects throughout the game and all of them add a lot. The same can be said of the mud spray that kicks up toward the lens when you're restarting your bike.   Sound Motocross games always have that annoying element of constant, droning buzzsaw engines. It's unavoidable, really, and here it's no different. The actual sounds of the motorcycle engine are well-captured, although ultimately grating. The bikes growl to life, whine at high RPM and chortle when idling in the air.    The other sound effects are also good. Your player groans when he/she bites it, creates a resonant clanging sound when he/she comes into contact with metal. There is thudding of bodies as they hit the dirt, and a great clattering noise as your bike touches back down on terra firma. In addition to the great sound effects, there is a general announcer who calls out the names of your tricks as you perform them, and comments from your rider throughout. Some of this stuff gets a little old, but as always, there's an option to simply turn it off.  As for music, there are several tracks by Dry Cell, who make me yearn for the simpler days of GWAR. I guess their sound goes along with the tattoo and fumes thing going on here, but I didn't find their music especially exciting. Anyway, it's here if you like it. There's Audio Options if you don't.    While the gameplay is nothing new, Freekstyle delivers a fun, fast racing experience that flies in the face of most other motocross games. It's got tight control, serious speed and a cool tattoo and leather feel. Bottom line, if you like arcade-style racing or SSX, you'll like this game. Anyone sick of these kind of games need not apply.", "date": "Jun 17, 2002"}
