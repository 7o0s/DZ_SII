{"name": "SEGA Marine Fishing", "name_review": "Sega Marine Fishing", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/25/sega-marine-fishing", "text": "The summers of my youth mainly consisted of romps at my local 7-11 to assert my Street Fighter II neighborhood dominance or painful hours spent at my piano teacher's dungeon.  But in between those two activities, I would get dragged by my uncle for the oldest type of male bonding ritual - fishing.  Not that we really bonded since he told me to shut up so I wouldn't disturb the fish.  Of course, he was an exception to the rule and would swear worse than sailor when he broke his line, caught a bad fish, or let a particularly juicy fish getting away.  As for me, it was an educational experience when I look back on it now, one I don't plan to share with any of my future offspring.  And the whole process of fishing can be an absolute pain: getting the proper equipment, getting a fishing license, waiting in the middle of a lake full of mosquitoes, etc.  Kids don't know how lucky they are nowadays, since they can boot up their Dreamcast and power-up SEGA Bass Fishing to get the same thrill of fishing without the pain.  And if you haven't experienced fishing video games yet or if you're a fan of the fishing game genre then you'll be happy to know that SEGA Marine Fishing not only delivers the same fishing fun.  Additional modes of play not found in the arcade version give this title much more gameplay for each cast.  While most will blow this game off as another ~arcade translation with no long-term play~ I have to give it up to the Dreamcast team who produced the home version of SEGA Marine Fishing.  Not only did the team deliver an excellent translation, but added some great extras that will give added longevity to this title.  Noteworthy is the added mini games in Original Mode.  Here you can play five different types of mini-games, all training you in various fishing techniques of luring, casting, and ~fight~ training.  Setting records in these mini games will unlock all sorts of cool extras including, different baits, improved fishing rods, helpful items, and new background music.  In addition, certain items you find can be viewed in Aquarium Mode, including coral reefs, fish, and unusual underwater items like divers and miniature submarines.  Okay, it sounds like I'm some kind of fanatic with this fishing game and I suppose I am.  I spent hours playing through the mini games unlocking various items to use in the aquarium.  Once in Aquarium Mode, you may change the background music from a number of songs and you'll have up to 14 different camera position to view the various objects and creatures in the aquarium.  There's a certain refreshing, relaxing quality about this whole process that I found very fun.  It also helps that the gameplay, for a fishing game, is relatively enjoyable as well.  The fishing mechanics are relatively the same as those found in SEGA Bass Fishing.  Of course, you're fishing in larger, saltier waters in this game so instead of just luring bass to bite, you'll have Barracudas, Sailfish, Dolphin Fish, Yellowfin Tuna, Stingrays, Hammerhead Sharks, and the grand prize of marine fishing, the Blue Marlin.  And each type of fish reacts differently to your luring and baiting techniques, making it a bit more complex when compared to SEGA Bass Fishing.  Another big plus is now you have much more control on where you cast your bait, enabling you to make short and long casts.  Although fishing games aren't exactly filled with eye-candy galore, SEGA Marine Fishing looks better than SEGA Bass Fishing, especially with the added water effects.  Most noticeable are the misty sea breeze effects you'll see in the Coral Reef stage as well as the improved ripples when reeling in your bait.  There are a few collision problems that appear when reeling hooked fish in usually occurring when a fish comes in contact with an underwater object.  Though it's not often that you'll see fish going ~through~ coral reefs and other obstacles, it does happen, especially with smaller fish.  All the fish are very well detailed and look extremely life-like, though they do seem a bit stiff on the animation side.  But I'm beginning to nit-pick as none of this prevents you from enjoying the game.  It's worth noting that there is a network feature in this game that allows players to log into the official SEGA Marine Fishing webpage, where you can upload and download ~fish mail~ and compete in fishing competitions.  There will be different fishing competitions where players catch fish according to specified rules on the home page.  One of these days, we'll be able to have a true ~online fishing~ where video game fishing fans can meet, fish, and compare rods... er, maybe not.  And for that matter, such an ~online fishing~ game won't be in demand since fishing games aren't overwhelmingly popular.  But if you're in the mood for something different or if you enjoyed SEGA Bass Fishing, SEGA Marine Fishing is definitely a fresh catch that you can enjoy without the hassles of real fishing... and potty-mouthed uncles.   --Anthony ~Oh, a BIG one~ Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Oct 25, 2000"}
