The quirky title, which is developed by Runecraft Software, can best be described as Bust-A-Move gone 3D, tripped out on acid, and lacking the sparkly polish that gamers have come to expect from Taito's classic puzzler franchise.The FactsChoose from up to five different DJ Poppers, each with a special power-upTraining, Chilled, Groovin' and HardCore difficulty setUnique set of four soundtracksUse up to nine different Special Attacks to keep those bubbles poppin'Selectable Jukebox song orderMultiple bubble skins and background effectsTwo-player head-to-head matchesGameplaySuper Bubble Pop isn't an entirely new concept. The game is, in the end, simply the fruit of another attempt by a developer to translate the addictive play elements of classic 2D puzzlers into the more bankable third-dimension. Nor is the project's style fresh or different. The Nintendo 64 release Tetrisphere similarly mixed a psychedelic atmosphere and pumping techno music together and more successfully at that. No, what we have here is a run-of-the-mill 3D puzzle game with a few intriguing concepts, a decent soundtrack, and not enough in-between to keep players busy, especially next-generation console owners who've come to expect something above and beyond from their library of games.After choosing a character from a selection of five dancing DJs (one of which is a robot, thank you), and selecting a skill level, players jump immediately into the guts of the game. There's barely an options list to be found, let alone different gameplay styles, which is certainly discouraging. The point is to maneuver the selected DJ from left to right and shoot bubbles at their colored counterparts as they slowly advance across a nine-by-nine grid. It's fairly simple stuff, but it is made slightly more complicated as three matching bubbles, be them in horizontal or vertical form, cancel each other out, award players points, and help clear the battlefield, so to speak. Meanwhile, DJs can earn power-ups that momentarily freeze columns of bubbles, or flip them, or indeed which send out giant waves that can knock out an entire board. These power-ups, intuitively gained by knocking out bubbles, are easily the most rewarding element of the game.But the concept is stale. And the execution makes matters worse. The simple process of moving the DJ from left to right is slower than we'd have liked, and this has a bearing on just how fast bubbles can be eliminated. Also, players will definitely misstep on the grid and accidentally jettison a bubble down the wrong column, an annoyance more the fault of the lagging response of the DJ and the decidedly awkward view of the board than anything else. There is a degree of enjoyment to be discovered in between these issues, no doubt. Eliminating bubbles is every bit as satisfying as knocking out Tetris pieces. We similarly appreciate some of the combos that can be linked and the many power-ups that enhance the presentation. But the oversights that engulf the experience also tug and drag it down, removing it altogether from the level of AAA puzzle efforts.If there is a saving grace, it's the game's multiplayer mode. Here two players can compete side-by-side, and indeed the very nature of this play style leads to a more interactive and recommended result. However, it does not eliminate or shadow the many flaws in gameplay execution.Further, Super Bubble Pop seems to be one of the shallowest games to hit Nintendo's next-generation console. From the simple, and yet still confusing menu interface and total lack of play styles or modes to the way stages remain graphically unchanged unless players go into the options area and specify a different texture theme, it all smacks of sloppiness. Even the play is unchanged, a randomly generated selection of board after board after board. The pure volume of repetition is nearly unparalleled. A real tragedy given that so many competing puzzle games are so focused, tightly knit and deep.   GraphicsSuper Bubble Pop looks like a Nintendo 64 technical demo; the kind of demo that garage developers were putting out as a hobby, not the professional stuff. It's sad, but true. Sure, the psychedelic style is admirable, but barren playfields and extremely low-polygon characters that are severely lacking in acceptable, fluid animation cheapen the graphics considerably. There is similarly very little in the vein of texture design. And, don't get us started on the awful menu interface, which is so confusing that it's usually hard to tell which option is being selected. This is hardly next-generation material. On a brighter note, though, a barrage of coloring effects stain the grids and the acid trip-induced backgrounds haze by continually, a wide variety of particle effects impress and the game does at least run at 60 frames per second. Obviously, no progressive scan support.SoundSolid enough techno tunes, though a little  clich. Don't expect to find anything from Aphex Twin or DJ Diesel Boy in this selection of songs. But the selection is fast-paced, upbeat and mingles well with the puzzle action of the game. Also, there is a commendable number of songs to choose from, which is a plus. Everything hits hard and sounds crisp and clear. No Dolby Pro Logic II support, even after all of this time, is too bad.Super Bubble Pop isn't a terrible game. In fact, there is a miniscule degree of satisfaction to be gained when toying around with its premature puzzles. But it's a title that's not even in the same league as AAA puzzle offerings like Bust-A-Move. The Runecraft-developed GCN effort, a psychedelic romp through repetitious 3D grids, feels like a puzzle technical demo more than anything else. It's shallow. Unrefined. And unpolished. And these descriptions describe its pitiful graphic qualities too.Too little and too late. There are far better puzzle games on the market.", "date": "Feb 12, 2003"}
