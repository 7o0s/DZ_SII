But do they really want these rewards? Or is the pursuit of the material blinding them to their real needs and desires?   None of these questions are actually answered in Atlantis Treasures, a puzzler based on a recent full-length SpongeBob special episode, but they were certainly the thoughts going through my head. I certainly had the brain space to do so, since this puzzle game isn't exactly a taxing challenge. Remember Sega's gem-dropping Columns? Throw that on a spindle and add some SpongeBob stuff -- that's the core of Atlantis Treasures.   Colored objects drop in threes from the ceiling. You must shuffle the objects to match three or more like-colored objects. It's a very, very familiar mechanic. Atlantis Treasures adds a few wrinkles, though, that help. Each room in the underwater city is themed and some have special mechanics in addition to color matching. To win the unused weapons of Atlantis, Plankton must disarm a series of bombs by matching them up with like-colored spheres. Sandy the Squirrel must make several matches in each column of the spindle to pass her level and earn science equipment. There are also several hidden medals awarded when you make certain shapes with your matches, such as a + formation or a pair of parallel lines.   While I certainly thought the license was well applied and the game looked great, there is just no way around the pacing of the game. It's just too slow. Even as you get to later rooms, the game just doesn't present a reasonable challenge for puzzle fans. And that keeps me from offering that token ~Well, if you're a fan of SpongeBob...~ escape clause from an unfavorable review.  Atlantis Treasures suffers from its relatively slow pace. It's good for younger players, but anybody well versed in puzzle classics like Jewel Quest or Collapse risk getting bored much sooner than expected.", "date": "Jan 22, 2008"}
