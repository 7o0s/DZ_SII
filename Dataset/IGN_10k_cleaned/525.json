Godzilla finally  hits the Game Boy after all these months. This game, designed by Crawfish Interactive,  promised to give Game Boy gamers the ability to control one of the largest on-screen characters ever on the portable. It's a technical marvel for the Game Boy system, sure -- but the game itself is nothing more than an awkwardly controlling shooter. Features Based on the Fox animated show. Seven levels Exclusive level for Game Boy Color.   For Game Boy and Game Boy Color.    Let's get it all out in the open -- yes, Godzilla is huge -- and I'm not talking reputation.  He's a massive character on the Game Boy, giving the mammoth lizard the proper respect he (she?) deserves, even on the tiny Game Boy screen. The introduction even shows off how gargantuan this giant reptile is -- very cool.  However, it's obvious that the designers ~cheated~ to get Godzilla so big on the screen. You never see the creature completely -- he's always half missing, being cut off of the side of the screen. You never really control Godzilla completely -- you really only maneuver his head up and down to aim your fire breath at the onslaught of pesky humans and vehicles. Oh, you can stop his walk to block an attack or whip out your tail, but otherwise, it's like you're in command of Godzilla through some limited remote control.  And that's what the game boils down to -- a basic shooter where control the world's biggest target. The whole challenge is to try and not get Godzilla killed by using his guard when the enemies get too close, and aiming your head to shoot down the helicopters and soldiers. At the end of each round, you'll go face to face with another giant monster -- but don't expect to go toeclaw to toeclaw with it. The battle's always afar where you just thwap each other across the screen, much like going up after a giant spaceship boss in a game like R-Type. Godzilla will get powered-up throughout the game as you score points -- you'll earn a ~bite~ attack, a ~stomp~ attack, and faster speed in your existing moves. But even with these elements, the game doesn't move fast like the ~new~ Godzilla does, at least compared to the TV show and film.  Godzilla is an impressive game, no doubt about it. But then you actually start to play it and realize that you don't have as much control over Godzilla as you'd like. What, you can't climb buildings? Bah.  It's a decent shooter, but when you get a game with the Godzilla name, you expect to be able to destroy a lot more than just the little annoying humans and tanks and stuff. On a technical standpoint, it's excellent.  On the gameplay side, it's above average.", "date": "Dec 14, 1999"}
