ESPN NFL Football, the latest installment in the series formerly known as NFL 2K, is even better than last year's game--and that's a feat. A whole lot has been added to the overall experience--from full ESPN integration, to tightened AI, better graphics, and even more solid online play. The game's entire look is inundated with ESPN branding, which is a good thing. If you squint, you might just think you're watching the Worldwide Leader in Sports.  What's more, it seems that someone at ESPN Videogames (nee SEGA Sports) woke up and realized that nowadays, it just isn't enough to line up across from the fierce competition that is Madden and deliver a sim-style experience without any of the extra fixin's that make EA's game so special. ESPN NFL Football has plenty of new wrinkles, including the much-hyped First Person Mode, and the Crib, an excellent addition which allows players to unlock goods and add them to a fantasy pad... the ultimate in vanity. The Crib is precisely what the series has been missing from the get-go, and makes the experience beyond the actual football a lot of fun.  It remains to be seen whether this game can compete in a marketplace dominated by Madden while launching nearly a month after it, but ESPN Videogames has put a lot of effort into making this an essential game for any football fan's library.    Features Last year, this series introduced ESPN elements into the game. But the license came too late to the party to really be of much use. This year, ESPN has been added to every single nook and cranny of the game. From the overall menu system to Chris Berman doing pre- and post-game segments to the ESPN music to the GameCast stat tracking, this game is truly ESPN NFL Football. Fans of the network will feel right at home here.   Head-to-Head Available! Don't know which version of ESPN NFL Football to buy? We're going to tell you in this point-by-point breakdown, which details the differences between the PS2 and Xbox with screenshots and tons of info.  Buy or rent smart. Read this now!  Read It Now |     Another thing to love about this year's game is the much-ballyhooed First Person Football Mode. While we were pretty skeptical about it at first, it actually delivers on the promise of putting you into the center of the football action. Basically, First Person Mode has you looking out of the grill of whatever player you're controlling. You control the person at ground-level, which really tethers you into the on-field experience. The speed of the game, the differences in position play, and the intensity of hitting are very well done here.  While the perspective, orientation on the field and controls take a little getting used to, once you settle in and understand what you're doing, the mode can be very enjoyable. One thing that helps is the use of a Matrix-like control. When you snap the ball, you can press in on the thumbstick to slow down the action and get an idea what's going on (a la Enter the Matrix). This is especially helpful in the passing game, where reading receivers is key. Overall, running works a little bit better than passing, and is a little more fun, too. There will likely be players who choose to focus on this mode, and there is a place for them... First Person Mode is available in Franchise and online.   For the rest of the gaming public, who prefer to stick to the third person mode, the experience is great. There are plenty of modes to choose from in the third person game, including the standard Quick Game, Practice, Tournament and Franchise.    Franchise hounds will be happy that to find out that many of the ESPN elements have been worked into this mode, and newbies to Franchise will be pleased that the new interface;which uses emails to the general manager as the main means of communication; it's a lot less confusing than last year's offering.  Improvements in the trade AI will thrill purists, as the CPU has gotten a lot stingier and more difficult to exploit. At the same time, high profile free agents will not sit around forever as they did last year. Other, smarter teams will snatch them up, so you'll have to be a shrewd GM in order to succeed. Player attributes also seem to progress a little more realistically season-to-season this time around. Last year, my Cleveland franchise saw Ricky Dudley swing from a 60-something to 90+ in one season, then down to 50-something a year later. That kind of wild ratings-swinging has been addressed in this year's edition.  Aside from the cosmetic upgrade, the changes seem rather subtle, especially considering how revamped a lot of this game is. The Franchise certainly didn't make as profound a leap as Madden did with the inclusion of Owner Mode, and that gives ESPN room to grow next year.   Then there's online. We were very excited to get our hands on the League feature of the online this year, but alas, that functionality is not yet working. It promises to interface with the ESPN Videogames web site, and will ultimately allow you to check out your league away from the PS2, so it should make the online experience even better when it launches in earnest. Check back to hear our thoughts on it later on IGNPS2.    What's online now is a simple head-to-head interface, and it works well. The game supports use of the SOCOM headset, so now everybody can feel like they're playing Xbox Live. There is a lobby to check out prospective matches and woo possible gaming partners, and even though it is rudimentary, it is very no-nonsense and functional. The leader board is also fairly basic right now, simply ranking players in each of four difficulties, and First Person Mode. What needs to be included is a way to jump directly to your personal ranking, as there is no function for that at the moment.  Overall, connectivity is pretty good. Not only that, but you can tell who has a good connection by referring to a simple graphical interface. During the matches we played, the lag was very minor, and only really occurred against less-than-good connections. It was a decent outing for the first day of service, and since the servers usually get better as time progresses, the online seems to be A-OK. We just can't wait for League play to begin.   Gameplay Since its debut on the Dreamcast, the NFL 2K series has provided a crisp, fast and decidedly sim-style experience. ESPN NFL Football extends the tradition, and improves on some nagging problems that have plagued the series in recent years. The kinks have been removed in a couple of key areas-- receivers catching the ball, and DBs catching interceptions-- making for a more fun, less frustrating experience overall.   For those who played the game extensively last year, the fixes in these areas will likely please you more than anything else. Last year's NFL 2K3 was guilty of too many dropped balls. Receivers couldn't hang onto a ball in a crowd if the fate of the universe depended on it. And if you tried to catch a ball and got hit, there was usually no way of bringing it down. Now, the drops have been toned down considerably. That doesn't mean the QB completes every pass, or that drops never happen they simply happen a more normal amount.   On the other side of the ball, the DBs don't victimize you as often as before. In previous iterations (at the higher difficulty levels), interceptions were almost as common as completed passes, and that made for a frustrating gaming experience. In ESPN, the play of the secondary has been evened out in general. The DBs don't usually get burned big unless you've called the wrong defense, and they don't normally drop passes thrown right to them anymore, as often happened last year. Basically, they play as DBs should.  Another nagging problem in years past has been the play-calling, which got a Madden-esque facelift this year. Instead of the infamous ring of plays from years past, the menus have been made square, and laid out in rows. In addition, the play-calling screens now allow you to sub and switch athletes in and out quickly. For instance, you can spell your halfback, flip your defensive ends, and shuffle your corners before picking the formation. This wrinkle is another layer of strategy to give you the maximum control, and it all works well. There are still a few layers to the play-calling, but the layout is a lot easier to understand, and it's quicker to find the play you really want to run.  Most likely, the play you're really going to want to run is a rushing play. The running mechanics are super smooth, and you really get a sense of energy and accomplishment out of the running game. This stems from great line play and blocking mechanics. But that's not it. The running game incorporates everything you'd see from an NFL back. When the fullback is moving the pack, the running back might put a forearm on his back and drive the pile forward. On spin moves, the back will actually sweep his hand to try to brush off would-be tacklers. The logic involved in all of the player movements is quite impressive.    In addition, the sprinting has been enhanced. There's the old-school rush feeling of button mashing, which you can do to speed up. Or, you can charge up the meter and use it to pull off more exaggerated moves. The special moves are all very effective, and can be used to seriously victimize the defense. By stringing them together in the right way, you can pull off some pretty jaw-dropping runs. The moves are context-sensitive, so pressing the button may give you a stutter-step or head-fake, depending on where the defender is in reference to you.  These new moves make for a lot more big plays than in previous years. That's not to say that the possession game is gone; it's just been spiced up with some more exciting moments. This makes the whole experience match the explosiveness of the NFL. Bottom line, it makes the game more fun.  The special teams experience has been enhanced by the bevy of new jukes, as kick and punt returns are made much more possible than ever before. Some players may find that there are too many (three in one game is a possibility, if you're adept at the controls), and others will relish the increased opportunity to take it to the house. The placekicking game has also been made easier. Gone is the drifting arrow, making the kicking a line-up-and-blast affair. The challenge lies in lining it up, judging the wind, and hitting the meter correctly. Even so, the kicking averages will definitely increase this year, and this may dismay some fans. Kicking is easy!  Another problem with the refurbished special moves and emphasis on big plays is that they make a problem for defenses. Tackling is much more difficult than in years past. In fact, it's pretty rare to score a solo tackle in this game. Even when you meet a back head-on, he'll often shuck you and go about his business. While this is par for the course during multiplayer games, it gets frustrating when playing alone. After all, not every tackle in the NFL is a gang tackle.   Luckily, there are different difficulty settings to help curtail these things. The game's default setting is Pro, and it allows for a pretty wide-open experience. All-Pro makes tackling a lot more difficult for human players, and makes the defense even better at bringing you down. In addition, there's a pretty extensive array of sliders to adjust exactly how the game plays.  If you're getting lit up deep, you can crank the human defensive backs, and make the game a little more even for yourself. The only real drawback to the slider control is that it disables some of the Crib functions, depending on what you're adjusting. Therefore, if you end up adjusting something that you think is essential to add to the realism (or fun) of a game, you may be penalized in the Crib. There had to be checks and balances to make sure people weren't exploiting the sliders to make the game too easy and unlock the Crib all at once, but it does seem arbitrary what is allowed.  For the most part, the controls are very solid and easy to pick up. Even advanced moves, like line control, have been simplified... and there are a lot more things you can do than ever before. From Hot Routes to play flipping, to putting multiple players in motion, to walking up the DBs in bump and run coverage, the before-snap play has made a huge leap since last year, and competes with the likes of Madden in terms of options.    Running and passing controls are pretty much the same, but the auxiliary controls have been tightened. The defensive line controls are handled on the right analog stick with a simple flick. Audibles are easy to manage, and are formation-specific, which makes for a lot more options. Plus, you can set an audible right at the line of scrimmage, which comes in handy. Motion could be a little easier to pull off, as it is sometimes difficult to scroll through the large number of receivers to get to the one you need. The PS2 control is even a little better than its Xbox counterpart, primarily because there are two extra shoulder buttons, and that makes for a lot less weird button configurations.   ESPN also adds a much better Challenge system than in years past. The refs are actually fallible, so Challenge means something. In fact, challenging calls has a pretty good success rate in the gameprobably even a little higher success rate in the NFL. It's handled well, though, as it helps crank up game tension, and provides yet another layer of realism.   Realism tempered with fun is what the gameplay is all about this year. It's nice to see that SEGA has decided to loosen the belt, as it makes for a much more enjoyable game...both as a single player and multiplayer experience.   Graphics Perhaps the biggest graphical enhancement made this year was the artful addition of all of the ESPN elements we discussed earlier. At times during play, you'll think you're watching a Sunday Night Football broadcast. From the menus, to the cutaways, to the opening segments before each game, and especially the during the replays and half time, this game has a slick polish and defined look about it, something it had been lacking in previous years.   Automatic replays are also strikingly better. Not only do they capture the coolest angles, and deliver the most glorious display of your triumph (or failure), they do so in a many different ways. Sometimes, the play will cut and simply show you a straight replay. Other times, the action will be displayed in a video window with statistical information surrounding it. Or, the action will cut away to a player profile. All of these things help you believe you're watching an actual NFL broadcast.  Between plays, the action never rests. There are great-close-up animations of fans cheering, teammates congratulating each other (or hanging their heads in shame), and excellent group celebrations. A lot of this stuff is team-specific, too, and all of it looks great. In Green Bay, for instance, you'll see cheeseheads in the crowd, and witness the Lambeau Leap when they score.  The player models also look a lot more realistic and less top-heavy than in years past. In fact, they just may be the best models among this year's crop of football titles. They're well-proportioned, highly articulated, well-textured and not too shiny in the helmet region.   Above the shoulders, though, the face models could be a little better defined, as they still look kind a little ~off~. The coach models are also a little off. Almost to a man, they're too portly (just look at Tony Dungy), and often their faces look little like the real life countenances they're meant to be based on.    The player animations are also somewhat of a mixed bag. While ESPN NFL Football does a great job of linking animations together, some of the movements don't quite capture the realism that others do. For instance, when your player breaks away from the pack and goes sprinting downfield, the running animation looks rather mechanical, and doesn't mesh with the more organic, free-flowing play close to the line. In addition, some of the catch animations are a bit strange--players sometimes move awkwardly to catch the ball, putting their bodies into unnatural positions for no apparent reason.  This makes for a more uneven experience than it could be. Still, much of the animation work is outstanding. Players move fluidly from a spin move, brushing off a would-be tackler, then making a slight cut that makes a defender miss. The jukes and stutter-steps are a lot less mechanical than in other games, and obey context-sensitive rules that make them varied and specific to the situation.   The tackling is also some of the most realistic and varied we've seen. Guys don't just get knocked off of their feet. Some are collared from behind, others are tripped up and eventually fall on their own, others simply get lit up while going across the middle. The variety of different context-sensitive tackles is astounding, and deserves high praise. Even after a full season of playing, tackles that you've never seen before will pop up, and that's a beautiful thing.  Of course, most of these things apply more to third person football. First Person Mode is equally impressive from a graphical standpoint, but it has a few more bugs, too. For instance, since the action is so close, you experience a lot more pronounced clipping. While a lot of this stuff is either masked or eliminated during the third person perspective, it is often a problem in FPM. It doesn't impede gameplay, but it is definitely noticeable.   Then there are the cheerleaders. While their reappearance in football video games is more than welcome, the pep squad that ESPN NFL Football serves up is downright ghastly. Their movement is fine and dandy, but their character models are anorexic and clownish. Live video of specific team cheerleaders would be a vast improvement.  Problems aside, the Visual Concepts crew has done a stellar job making this game look amazing. The game isn't quite as crisp as on the Xbox, but it's no slouch. In fact, it's possibly the prettiest football game on the market this year and definitely has the most visual flourishes of them all.  Sound The commentary in ESPN NFL Football again deserves MVP honors. While it doesn't survive the pitfall of becoming repetitive over the course of a season (what commentary does?), it does offer one of the more complex and interactive reaction systems we've heard from a video game.  Things you do early in the game often come back around in the commentary later on. The effect is very natural. For instance, if your player drops a key pass early in the game, then comes back to score a touchdown, the commentary may say something like ~That atones for that earlier drop.~ It's touches like this that make the commentary stand out.   While the voices may get grating after awhile, at least the talent has interesting things to say. What's more, it does a pretty decent job of keeping up with the play on the field, as well as commenting on the numerous replays. In fact, that's another area where the audio really shines. Special attention is given to the replays, and the commentary follows it, pointing out exactly why a run was successful, or where a penalty occurred, exactly as the action is unfolding.    The excellent commentary carries through to the pre-game and halftime. As we've already mentioned, the inclusion of ESPN personalities like Chris Berman really helps the overall experience. Nowhere is this more prevalent than in game introductions and especially the Chris Berman Halftime Report. As snapshots of the game play before you, Boomer dishes his signature quips, tailoring his commentary specifically to player performance. These segments are pitch perfect, placing you in the position of an ESPN viewer, which is exactly the effect one would hope for when purchasing a game called ESPN NFL Football.  The on-field chatter between players is also very well done, although not as pervasive as it could be. In First Person Mode, you really get a sense of the smack talk going on down on the field, and it ranges from informative to funny. Touches like this add an extra layer of realism, and help you immerse yourself completely in the game experience.  The rest of the sounds--crowds, sound effects, etc. -- are good as well, but don't offer much more than what was available last year. Still, there wasn't really anything wrong with it, so no need to fix it. The fact of the matter is that this game sounds great, and audiophiles won't be disappointed.For those who have been waiting patiently for ESPN NFL Football, the extra time was worth it. This is the tightest offering of the series to date, with improved AI--especially in the passing game-- and loads of features. In fact, the only thing that may be slightly disappointing is that the Franchise Mode, aside from better overall trade AI and player progression, seems very similar to last year's offering--certainly not the kind of leap that Madden made with the addition of Owner Mode. But it's a great package nonetheless, and NFL 2K faithful will again have something to brag about.For those who haven't yet purchased a football game, and are undecided, ESPN NFL Football is worth a serious look. This year's game sets a new standard for fluid gameplay (especially in the running game). In addition, it's a great head-to-head game, the online play is top-notch, and the Crib offers something even cooler than Madden Cards. For longtime Madden fans who have already purchased and explored this year's excellent offering, ESPN NFL Football might make you ponder an interesting question-- is it possible to own and play two excellent simulation-style football games? We think so. Bottom line, you can't go wrong with ESPN NFL. The series has always contended with the best football games out there, and this year is no exception.", "date": "Sep 5, 2003"}
