Even though the American media likes to stereotype these heroes of American culture as beer-swigging, fisticuffing, fifty-pound-overweight lummoxes, they just so happen to keep this country running like clockwork, and the men and women of the highway have my utmost respect. (The fact that they could beat the ever-loving bejeezus out of me at the drop of a hat probably has something to do with it too.) And thanks to the inexplicable Japanese fascination with all aspects of American culture, AM2's latest offering is a racing game based in the high-speed, heavy-metal world of professional trucking. Awesome.  The arcade version of 18-Wheeler: American Pro Trucker made waves in Japan, thanks to one of the most enormous cabinets in the history of the midway. Featuring an oversized steering wheel and a horn that rattles the teeth of anyone in close proximity, the kids just can't get enough of the big, stoopid truck-driving thrills as they plow their way from coast to coast. Yes indeed, 'tis a magnificent arcade game, and follows the standard formula of Three Minutes for a Buck  but can the home game stack up in terms of replay value?  After watching a fine rolling intro, you'll find yourself at a mode select screen that's stocked to the brim with goodies. The first choice available is Arcade Mode, which is the meat and potatoes of the game: your job is to make four runs across the continental US, going from New York to Key West, then onwards to Dallas, Las Vegas, and San Francisco. You'll be able to make your long-distance trip in style, and select from a garage full of delightful stereotypes: you've got your tabaccy-spittin' Asphalt Cowboy, a fat guy with a gut the size of Cleveland, a halter-top-wearing leather goddess, and a guy with an enormous afro. Each of their rigs has different stats in terms of speed, traction, and power, and the quartet follows the same path through the game.  All four vehicles drive surprisingly well, providing incredibly tight turning radiuses at low speeds, and quick handling when flying along at 100MPH. The time meter is unforgiving, and puts great emphasis on precision driving and foreknowledge of the track ahead. One particularly tricky technique is slipstreaming, which gives you a speed boost by driving in the downdraft of the vehicle in front of you.  Each cross-country trip is tightly compressed into a track that takes around two minutes to complete, while spanning multiple hours (virtually, anyway) -- Shen Mue-style ~Magic Weather~ provides subtle transitions between day and night. There are also numerous scripted events that occur in each area  during one Midwest run, you'll encounter a tornado that tosses traffic directly into your path. While this is indeed cool, the events get old after the fifth or sixth time you see them, and foreshadow the lack of replay value. Ditto with the placement of the bonus vehicles  if you plow into a special ~Fireball~ van, you gain an extra three seconds. And yes, they're always in the same place.  On the other hand, every trip through the game won't be the same, as you're able to branch off into a different direction at set points. While there are only two paths through a small part of each level, some of them offer risky set-ups that may take some practice (driving on the mountainside road is easier said than done, thanks to a 45-degree turn that may send you flying several hundred feet down).  But don't get cocky, Greenhorn  a rival trucker named Lizardtail is on a mission to make your life miserable, and verbally berates you over your CB radio with silly taunts. This wretched bastard will make it his goal to ram you, cut in front of you, or take shortcuts through neatly-stacked crates in order to shave a few seconds off his total time. If you're in front of him by the time you reach your goal, you're given a monetary bonus, and a pat on the back from your boss.  Breaking up the long-range trucking action are parking mini-games, where your goal is to put your truck into a flashing green area. This is easier said than done, since you've got to be perfectly lined up  and knocking over crates or streetlamps will suck points off your total score. If you do succeed, however, you'll be given special powerups, like a new horn, muffler, or engine.  Once you've beaten the arcade mode (which should take thirty minutes or less), you can move on to the new ~Parking Challenge~ mode. These sequences are slightly reminiscent of the ~Crazy Box~ mini-games in Crazy Taxi, giving you quick-and-dirty challenges that test your technical driving skill. There are four brand-new stages selectable from the get-go, and your goal is simply to park your truck in certain spaces within the allotted time. This can get evilly difficult when traversing tight alleys or driving in reverse, and I eventually found myself playing these mini-games more than the actual arcade mode. Sadly, there's no quick-restart after failing a parking challenge  you have to select your rig and track again, which takes a good twenty seconds or so. Grr.  ~Score Attack~ is another new addition, which gives you four new closed-circuit tracks to race on. The goal here is to score the fastest time, while running into bonus vehicles and avoiding oncoming traffic (there is a lot of it, mind you). While the new tracks aren't much to write home about, they're the only ones available in the new Versus mode, which offers hot-and-heavy split-screen trucking action. If only we could have raced the normal tracks in split-screen mode, or via a link-cable option...  Oh, and if you're looking for pretty graphics to redeem the gameplay, you're out of luck. While 18-Wheeler is by no means the worst-looking racer on Dreamcast, it's definitely not up to the lofty standards set by F355. While the usage of color and texture is excellent, the graphics engine itself seems clunky  the frame rate only runs at 30fps, and features more fog and pop-in than we'd like in a second-generation Dreamcast game. As a whole, Crazy Taxi looks and moves much better. I can't say much about the audio content, either  if I never have to hear J-Country again, I'll die a happy man.  So is it worth a $60 import? Oh, hell no. Is it worth picking up when it hits the States?  Well, Sega of America IS adding Online play and a few extra goodies, but we'll have to see.  An arcade game like Crazy Taxi is infinitely replayable because it's fast, furious, and open-ended. On the other hand, a home version of 18-Wheeler is instantly damned by its eight minutes of linear racing, and all the time attack modes and mini-games in the world can't fix that. Our advice? Rent it if you can, then keep on truckin' with the upcoming Daytona remake instead.  -- Colin ~Texas Red' Williamson, IGNDCI gotta disagree with Colin here.  I think this game is one of the best looking titles on Dreamcast.  There's a whole lotta detail in the backgrounds, and the sense of movement for the truck adds to the feeling that you're there.  Who cares if the framerate is only 30 - it looks smooth enough to me.But we can all be sure of one thing: this game isn't worth the sixty bucks.  It's fun, sure, and there's some amount of technique to be learned, but AM2 really should have added more full courses to the mix.  Maybe Sega of America's inclusion of Online play for the US version will help out some.", "date": "Oct 16, 2000"}
