Only the curmudgeonliest at heart could dislike LEGO bricks and despite the tepid response to the prequel trilogy, fans still love ~Star Wars.~ Although the first console hit was released two years ago, the mobile game finally comes to North America -- as a Sprint exclusive -- following release in other territories. (The sequel is already available in European nations.) The mobile game, developed by Universomo, makes a valiant attempt to capture the lightning in a bottle of the console game but without the detail provided on the larger screen and more powerful hardware, LEGO Star Wars ends up a pale imitator.   Instead of seeing droids explode into dozens of little bricks, for example, things just explode in a poof. Character sprites don't look so much like LEGO characters but little, super-deformed heroes and villains. Atmosphere was a major factor in the original title's enjoyment, and that just isn't happening here. What were left with is a workable but unremarkable action game with puzzle elements starring characters we are told are made of LEGO bricks.   You must guide Anakin Skywalker through 21 connected rooms with General Grievous' massive space cruiser. The ultimate goal is to rescue Senator Palpatine, but in order to reach the would-be Emperor, you must chop through a few dozen droid guards and push a bunch of blocks with your Force powers.  Many rooms have a combination of these features. You may need to unlock a door proceed, but doing so releases a patrol of droids. You use your lightsaber to deal with the droids, either getting in close to chop them down or bat a laser beam back at them with a well-timed swing.   Neither the action nor puzzle elements are particularly engaging. There is no fatal flaw -- it's just that the pacing is slow and doesn't anything to really advance the ball like, say, Universomo's 300 mobile game. This adheres to such a bland script of slice droid, push block, activate switch that many players may retire by the tenth or eleventh room. There is a very light collecting mechanic. You must pick up little LEGO bricks to replenish Anakin's life bar so he can survive the increasing numbers of droids, but this doesn't do much to add variety.  LEGO Star Wars just lumbers through the paces too much to stand out from the pack of mobile action games. The puzzles slow the game down to a crawl when all you really want to do is swat some droid thugs with your lightsaber. But when you get frustrated of returning laser volleys with ill-timed swipes, you'll just wish for a block puzzle to move on to the Senator's location. Couple the pacing with the general lack of a LEGO atmosphere and there is little reason to download this game, no matter how much of a ~Star Wars~ fan you might still be.", "date": "Mar 27, 2007"}
