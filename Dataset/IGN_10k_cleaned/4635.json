Within moments, you have a rabid dog at your throat, accusing you of not being ~hardcore.~ Well, now you have a chance to salve those rattled nerves with a go-go version of the classic SNK shooting series, Metal Slug Mobile, courtesy of Digital Bridges.   Features:  Classic SNK game  Eight missions  Collect different weapons   When you start porting a game as beloved as this, you're courting disaster. However, Digital Bridges has preemptively struck at the SNK fanboys by releasing a rock solid version of Metal Slug. In the series, you control a tiny little soldier carrying more boom-boom than he can likely handle. It's a one-man army situation, squaring off with hordes of faceless infantrymen and gunners -- where victory comes not just from being quicker on the draw, but memorizing enemy placement and patterns.   Metal Slug Mobile is a side-scrolling action game, which holds its own against some of the bigger names in the category, like XIII and Prince of Persia. Of course, the pedigree certainly helps out, but much should be credited to Digital Bridges' excellent design team. They really have brought this arcade game home, in tact.   Metal Slug Mobile unfolds over eight different stages, ranging from a war-torn battlefront full of scalable scaffolding to a dark jungle combat zone. During most missions, you're running from left to right, dishing out Texas-style justice with your machine gun.   Notice we said ~most.~ There are vehicle levels where your little soldier jumps behind the wheel of a tank or the yoke of a jet fighter and takes on the bad guys with some extra firepower. These are great diversions from the regular run-and-gun action, keeping Metal Slug Mobile feeling fresh.   Control is always going to make or break these kinds of games, especially on cellphone. Metal Slug Mobile fares well here. Sure, you cannot tap the fire button as you run since the number pad will not accept simultaneous button presses, but the enemies are spaced out well enough that you have time and breathing room to stop for a half-second and deliver the kill shot.   Now, Metal Slug Mobile does a lot of things right, but the one thing that really impressed us was the fact that, finally, the guns in a shooting game actually sounded in the neighborhood of real gunfire. Whether or not this is a sample from the arcade game or whatever, it's nice to hear a gun that doesn't pop with a weak ~crink.~ Other nice touches are the opening jingle and the voice samples.  Big fan of the franchise? Then what are you waiting for? Metal Slug Mobile is an excellent recreation of the classic shooting series from SNK, thanks to some deft programming and good game smarts from Digital Bridges. The game looks great, sounds great, and once you get used to the control quirks, plays mighty fine. Highly recommended for anybody looking for a cellphone distraction that will last longer than twenty minutes.", "date": "Apr 10, 2004"}
