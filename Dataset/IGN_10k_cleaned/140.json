Thanks to the well-honed strategy engine that sits at the core of this game, Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn should be a no-brainer purchase for Wii gamers looking to tuck into something truly meaty. But this instalment - a direct sequel to the GameCube's Path of Radiance - is spoiled by dreary, dated graphics, controls still rooted in the Game Boy Advance era and a story that could send King Kong into a coma. Are we playing this on the Wii or did someone sneak a Game Boy Player into the room?    Turn-based strategy games get your synapses firing like nothing else. Ask anyone who has lost weeks of their life to Advance Wars, Final Fantasy Tactics and the other Fire Emblem titles why these games hold so much appeal and they'll explain how satisfying it is to tactically outwit an opponent over countless hours of hair yanking gameplay. Just like a tense game of Chess, there's drama, pain and elation in every turn. Fire Emblem still has this kind of strategy magic at its core, but Radiant Dawn does a good job of burying all that goodness in annoying flaws. Honestly, it feels like very little effort has gone into bringing this beloved series to the Wii.    Never bring a javelin to a dragon-fight.  Following the story in Radiant Dawn is like trying to understand all the ingredients that go into a smart drink. Sure, it's possible to figure it all out, but halfway through you'll probably lose interest and ask yourself why you bothered. It's just not that interesting. Considering how hardcore the tactical combat is, it's a shame that there's no compelling tale here to keep us eagerly clicking through to the next mission. What we have is a pretty dreary tale of political intrigue between warring factions in the land of Tellius. With territories called Daein and Begnion, and characters named Micaiah, Muarim, Nealuchi, Caineghis and Dheginsea - to only name but a few tongue twisters - Radiant Dawn's plot gives you a headache before you've even figured out who the good guys are. Aside from some gorgeous, however brief, animated cut-scenes scattered throughout the game, this epic tale is entirely told through text-filled dialogue boxes and static character portraits. While the artwork is nice, it doesn't even have the personality of the slide-show storytelling in Puzzle Quest.    Every character does appear to have a rich back-story - naturally, the characters returning from Path of Radiance will be endeared to some of you - but the delivery is so poor that we just stopped caring about a third of the way through the game. The tragic effect that this has on the experience, is that you start to question whether it's worth bothering to struggle through the viciously challenging turn-based battles - purely because you don't necessarily care (or understand) the motivation of the characters.    Caring about your characters is central to the Fire Emblem experience, because even though you spend hours levelling them up, equipping them with the best gear money can buy and plough through their personal dramas, one mistake during a battle can see them killed permanently. Unless you're willing to reload your game and try the battle from the beginning (or at least the mid-battle save point you've set aside - one of the best technical additions in this sequel), you have to learn to live with losing certain characters for good.   Just two of the uninteresting, poorly fleshed out characters in the game!  There's a certain allure to perfecting your combat tactics so that your heroes survive to fight another day and all your hard work levelling them up isn't gone to waste. It's a challenge. But these characters are about as interesting as cardboard cut-outs - which, ironically, is what they look like in all the dialogue scenes anyhow. Considering the number of ~game over~ screens you get to see when playing this game - and how difficult it is to keep some characters alive - there's very little motivation to pick the controller back up and keep playing.    If you're new to Fire Emblem, then there's an intimidating world of tactical depth to get a handle on here. Put simply, it's a rock-paper-scissors style game, but with many different types of rock, paper and scissors to worry about. Swords may have an advantage over axes, but then you also need to worry about lances, knives, staffs, bows, schools of magic, counter-attacks, character classes, mounted units, aerial units, slowly degrading equipment and terrain advantages.    Characters can also be paired to support each other during combat, so when within range they boost each other's stats (and can even engage in pointless banter). This tempts you to keep some characters near each other, even if it may not be entirely tactically sound.     Occasionally you'll get to take a breather between missions at a base camp where you can buy new weapons, items and try swapping skills between characters. A forge also allows you to make powerful weapons of any type, as long as you've got the cash to spare. However, acquiring money in Radiant Dawn is extremely difficult and you'll rarely get your hands on what you really want. Because missions are entirely linear, you can't go off questing to make some coin either.   Radiant Dawn has all this strategic depth going for it, but it's made almost impenetrable by both the aforementioned poor storytelling, shabby presentation and an unforgiving difficulty level. If you need to learn how to play, you basically have to scroll through an in-game encyclopaedia on all the aspects of combat to figure out how some things work. Once you get to grips with it, you're then faced with battles that are made tough as nails thanks to some very nasty AI that is unrelenting in its desire to punish you. With weaker characters in danger of being killed in one hit and some missions requiring you to keep them alive in order to claim victory, you'll find yourself restarting battles over and over. You almost have to learn the enemy's movement patterns before you can figure out where it's safe to play your units during the battle, which feels chore-like.    Oh man, I can see a Jill sandwich coming up!  Radiant Dawn's final sin is that it pretty much ignores the platform it has been developed for. The Wii Remote is used held sideways like a good old NES gamepad, even though the battlefields are begging for a more intuitive point and click interface. The Wii-mote has a point sensor, so why not use it? Directing your units across the map by pointing at the TV would instantly be quicker and more intuitive, not to mention more fun. Instead it's a mess of button presses, with the B trigger being used like a Shift key.    The Wii has also been sorely under-utilised when it comes to the game's graphics and sound, both which are almost identical to Path of Radiance on the GameCube. The terrain, map details and characters all look grainy and a bit blurry, with some half-decent battle animations that you'll turn off anyway in an effort to speed up the turn taking. There's just nothing here to make you go ~wow~ or to immerse you in the game world, making the experience all about pushing through boring menus and evaluating stats. A little bit of flashy entertainment wouldn't have gone astray.    Coloured lighting... they can do that now? What an age we live in. Clearly, its easier for Nintendo to stick with the crumbly old Fire Emblem formula of the GBA and GameCube days than attempt to innovate or come up with something exciting and fresh for the Wii, which is a real shame. The story, at the very least, could have been written with more style, and the graphics jazzed up to give us a bit of joy to go with our tactical frustration. The old-school controls and clumsy menus are even more evidence that not a lot of thought went into this sequel. At least they added widescreen support. The annoying thing is that Radiant Dawn still has a strong and addictive strategy game at its heart, if youre willing to put up with all of its shortcomings.", "date": "Apr 8, 2008"}
