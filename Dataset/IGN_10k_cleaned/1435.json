Just like I bought a PlayStation primarily to play racers, my Dreamcast was supposed to keep me entertained with Sega arcade conversions and sports titles. Speed Devils, Sega Rally 2 and Tokyo Xtreme just couldn't hold a candle to Psygnosis' F1 racers, Colin McRae and Polyphony Digital's videogame masterpiece, Gran Turismo. My, my, how things are changing. Not only is Dreamcast now home to some of the most enjoyable arcade racers on the market, it's also making a name for itself with hyper-detailed racing simulations. Cue Infogrames Melbourne House...  Hot on the heels of last month's quality arcade racer, Test Drive V-Rally, comes Infogrames' third Dreamcast Test Drive title -- and it further proves that Infogrames has some of the best racing game developers in the business. Based on the famous French endurance race, Test Drive Le Mans is not only a great simulation of the 24-hour GT extravaganza, it's the best racer on Dreamcast, period.   Developer Melbourne House has done a fine job at putting together a compelling arcade game that balances realism with pure enjoyment of driving and a great sense of speed. The secret to what makes Test Drive Le Mans so good lies in the title's fantastic driving model and almost ridiculous level of detail, coupled with three different difficulty settings. If you've only played pure arcade racers before, you should start off on the Amateur setting, which means not only less competent opponent AI, but also auto-braking and driving assistance. It's a great way to learn the ropes -- and you still have a sense of achievement when you beat the other cars to the finish line. But don't get too comfortable holding down the accelerator all the way. Playing the whole game on Amateur would mean denying yourself the true challenges: Intermediate and Expert. Imagine Intermediate as the Gran Turismo setting. There is no auto-braking, but the subtle driving assistance makes sure that flooring the accelerator in turns doesn't automatically result in you spinning out and smashing into a guard rail. The driving assistance feels so natural, you won't even notice it -- until you switch to the Expert setting and start painting pretzels on the asphalt. As far as control and speed goes, Test Drive Le Mans has no equal on Dreamcast. But a good driving engine is only half the fun. Let's see what else this game has to offer.  Test Drive Le Mans features four different single-player modes. You can try your luck at ~Quick Races~ on the game's 10 ACO-approved tracks (complete them all to win a sweet-ass Jaguar XR9 LM Concept Car) or enroll in eight multi-course Championships ranging from simple GT races over endurance GPs to a Winter Challenge. But if that's all you're interested in, then you're missing out on the good stuff. Apart from letting you tear up the asphalt on tracks ranging from Japan's Suzuka to England's Donington, Test Drive Le Mans of course simulates no race better than the title race: Le Mans. There are five different Le Mans challenges: 10 minutes, 30 minutes, one hour, six hours and 24 hours. Yes, you read that correctly. 24 hours. I have to confess that I haven't finished my first 24 hour race yet -- but I'm working on it. And I've already completed the other four... While I would have appreciated a save option that let you save anywhere, Test Drive Le Mans at least enables you to save your game during pit stops so that you don't have to leave your Dreamcast on for the full duration of the race (sadly, there is no such option for some of the longer Championship races). What sets the Le Mans race apart from the rest is the fact that you're racing around the clock. As you're defending your position against a pack of 23 hi-tech GT cars, the sun will slowly set on the horizon, night will fall, and two groups of cars will begin to form. Random weather conditions makes sure that each race is a different experience. As clear skies turn cloudy, rain may change the 13km-long track into a slippery mess, and a sound pit-stop strategy could decide over whether you'll win or lose.   If racing around the clock doesn't float your boat, Test Drive Le Mans also offers an excellent Time Trial Mode. Unlike in most other racing games, there is actually a reward for trying to improve your track records. Each one of the game's 10 tracks has a target time that you need to beat. Best it, and you'll unlock a new car. Trying to beat this preset time can be nerve-wracking, as you compete not only against the clock but also a ghost car replay of your best lap. It can be really frustrating when you've got a lead on your own shadow, only to see it zoom by you when you commit the tiniest of mistakes. But the feeling when you finally outdo the target time by a fraction of a second just can't be beat.   Which brings me to the visuals. Yep, GT3 on PS2 may turn out to be the most graphically impressive racer yet -- but until then, this title goes to Test Drive Le Mans. This game is absolutely gorgeous. Forget last year's PC version by Eutechnyx. Melbourne House sweats the details. How is this for starters: Test Drive Le Mans is able to display 24 cars on screen at 30 frames per second. Think about that for a second. Sega GT managed six. We're talking detailed GT2, GT1 and prototype cars, here -- a whopping 24 cars displaying brake glow, realtime shadows, skid marks and tire smoke. At night, with their lights on. Rain or sunshine. On top of that, the player's car also features reflection mapping and specular highlighting. And yes, you can see the drivers in the cockpits. You've got to leave it to Melbourne House, that's some wicked LOD management. But it's not only the cars that shine. Le Mans's licensed tracks, such as Suzuka, Le Mans, Catalunya and Donington International are accurately represented. Suzuka is virtually perfect and includes not only the trademark Ferris wheel, but also the oft-omitted rollercoaster. Donington, likewise, is brilliantly reproduced with spectators and their parked cars lining the green pastures. The road textures are darkened with skid marks in all the right places and the grass textures are so life-like, farmers are advised to tie down their cows (unless they want to end up with a broken TV). Flames shoot out of your car's exhaust pipes, clouds move across the sky, single drops of rain hit the ground, the wet asphalt reflects your brake lights, and the setting sun lengthens the shadows and douses everything in an orange glow. Even the cars' ultra-bright headlights are reproduced in all their amber and blue perfection. No racing game currently available for Dreamcast or PS2 comes close.  But it's the sound that really pushes Test Drive Le Mans over the top. Anyone who has ever been on a racetrack will be able to appreciate how much work the developers have put into making this game sound like the real thing. Forget about the clean engine hum you're used to from most racing games. Whether you're driving a GT2, GT1 or Prototype car, the engine sounds are appropriately ~dirty,~ interrupted by realistic gear shift clunks and backfiring. You'll also hear your opponents' cars in all their glory. Approach the leading pack and the roar of Audi and BMW engines will start to engulf you. Turn into a hairpin corner and you'll be treated to the sound of the cars on the other side of the track -- complete with Doppler Effect. Spectators cheer and sound their horns as you pass by and you can even make out the stadium announcer as you speed past the pits. Music-wise, Le Mans sticks to unobtrusive guitar rock. But you're best advised to turn down the CD audio and crank up the engine sounds for the real Le Mans experience. Thankfully, Melbourne House opted not to include a commentary track. Considering the length of the Le Mans races (10 minutes minimum), any commentator would have become repetitive rather quickly. Some pit talk would have been nice, though.  Overall, Test Drive Le Mans is simply the most enjoyable driving game I have seen on any console in a while. The whole package is so tight, it's tough to find any negatives that aren't due to the limitation of its license. There is only so much that can be done with a Le Mans racing game -- it does, after all, revolve around one single 24-hour race with a limited set of cars. A couple more tracks would have been nice -- and the absence of seperate AI difficulty options car damage is a bummer (after all, Le Mans is known for some spectacular crashes. Click here to see what I'm talking about). As far as multiplayer options go, the four-player split-screen races are smooth and fun, but SegaNet support and the option to compete in multiplayer GPs would have been a welcome addition. In the end, these are just minor flaws in an otherwise fantastic game.   Although Le Mans may not be able to compete with racing games packed full with oodles of production cars and fictitious courses, it more than excels at reproducing the event it's named after. The racing action is so involving, anyone who's played the game for a few minutes in our office has vowed to buy the game. Add to that the low price of $29 bucks and there is no reason why any Dreamcast owner should be without this sparkling gem of a racing game. Buy it. Turn up the volume. Hear your Dreamcast roar.   --Peer Schneider, IGN.com", "date": "Nov 7, 2000"}
