Its latest incarnation is Speedy Gonzales: Aztec Adventure, the sequel to its original Speedy Gonzales game for the Game Boy. However, the differences aren't that noticeable compared to the similarities as Aztec Adventure appears to be rehash of its predecessor.  Features: 18 Stages Multiple Weapons Password Save For Game Boy and Game Boy Color   If it weren't for the manual, you'd never know that Speedy's arch-nemesis, Sylvester, has kidnapped all the mice in Mexico and it's your duty to rescue them. Aztec Adventure starts you out on the streets of a Mexican city where you basically do nothing but collect cheese. Thankfully, the game's challenge increases throughout the levels and stages, but the challenge comes from faulty design and not clever gameplay. Many times you'll find an obstacle nearly impossible to pass through. At one point, you have to ride a floating platform under a rocky ceiling that has dripping lava with a bottomless pit underneath but the gap between each lava drip is very small and its hard to maneuver around on the tiny platform without either falling off or getting nailed on the noggin' with molten rock.  The game is split up into six themed levels, each consisting of three stages. Enemies don't appear frequently since the bulk of the difficulty is successfully leaping from one platform to the next and avoiding hazardous obstructions such as lava and spiked floors. At the end of each level, you'll face-off with an end-boss that can be either extremely tough or insanely easy.  All of the game's basics seem to flow consistently but can be generally lacking. For instance, the game can't handle more than one enemy on the screen at a time. If two somehow come about, which is very rare, the game will start to experience slowdown till you can get away. The sound and music seems to lack a little as the music is very repetitious and the sounds more annoying than useful. Luckily the game's graphics and animation saves the day. Each level will seamlessly flow across the screen and keep up with Speedy's rapid pace. The backdrops are colorful and Speedy is well animated with his sombrero flapping as he jumps from ledge to ledge while his tail snaps around.  While Aztec Adventure sports some beautiful backgrounds and intricate level designs, the abundance of minor flaws really hurt this game. For example, a password is only given at the end of a level, and its pretty tough to get through all three stages and an end-boss on four meager lives, especially since bottomless pits and long rows of deadly spikes are constant obstacles. Since Speedy Gonzales is obviously a children's game, its difficulty would most likely turn off many kids who may not be patient enough to wait for floating blocks to come back to Speedy or to carefully watch out for falling rocks or fire. As a fan of good side-scrolling games, I can't really recommend Speedy Gonzales: Aztec Adventure to anyone. You'd have to be looking for a pretty hard challenge where you may end up ripping half your hair out. The Game Boy is plagued with bad platformers and this one doesn't help the situation much. If you want some serious action, check out Super Mario Bros. DX or the newly released Ghosts 'n' Goblins.", "date": "Feb 3, 2000"}
