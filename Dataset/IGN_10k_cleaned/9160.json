As a result, you frequently find most sports games coming up with a new gameplay mechanic or gimmick that makes it stand out from other titles.  For Sony's basketball franchise on the PS2, the standout feature was The Life, a basketball melodrama designed to put players in the shoes of a rising superstar.  Although it was supposed to be a supplementary feature to the series, it quickly became the primary focus.  Unfortunately, the weaker aspects of the gameplay didn't receive nearly as much attention.  NBA 08 continues this trend, without any improvement of the court action and a weaker plot for The Life gameplay mode.   Like the previous installments of The Life before it, NBA 08 divides its focus between Single Game, The Life, NBA (now retitled League) and Online.  Single Game offers immediate jump in and play elements, such as exhibition matches against any league team that you want, including East and West All Star squads.  Players can choose to spot their opponents points, and even play their games on a few new courts taken from the Life story line, such as training centers and street courts. You can also try out your hand at the various mini-games that have been included, which have been divided once again into All-Star play options, drills, playground play and training camp.   Look familiar?  Probably because you've been playing the game for the past two years. The division between the four mini-game options makes sense, but none of them are new to the series.  In fact, we were hoping that this year we might see a dunk contest like the one that was included in last year's PSP version of NBA 07 (only better), or some new elements.  That's not to be.  You still face the same skills challenges, free throw and three point shooting contests, low post play and order following that you did last year.  With the exception of Own the Court, which is still the best mini-game included on this year's title, all of these mini-games remain a bland warm-up to the on court action that you'd experience with an exhibition game or seasonal play.     Once again, players can take their favorite teams through 29, 58 or 82 game seasons, although trade logic has been tightened up slightly as long as you make sure to toggle the option on, which is off by default.  With Restrict Trades on, the computer will finally make an intelligent decision and refuse to take a weaker player for a star on their team regardless of how many times you badger them.  However, you're still not dealing with salary caps, contracts or other standard features of franchises, which we've been campaigning for from this series for years.  We can only continually hope that this is eventually fixed, but if this did ever grace Sony's franchise, we'd expect it to go to the PS3 version of the game first.   The same issues from previous years affect NBA 08. However, what we didn't expect was the lack of actual innovation to this year's game.  For instance, NBA 06 introduced the colored halo system for shots.  Last year added the Smart Shot halo for automatic buckets and the Rebound Hot Spot for grabbing missed shots.  This year, players don't really gain anything in particular.  The three previously mentioned mechanics do return, but they haven't really been augmented in any way, even though the bullet points on the back of the box state otherwise.  That means that you can still make shots with a red or yellow halo and miss with a green halo.  For basketball players that picked up NBA 07 or 06, they're pretty familiar with the fact that your chances with a shot are decreased if a defender is in your face.  The TrueShot Indicator that's included is supposed to point this out, sometimes showing up in the halo as you're lining up your shot to indicate that your chances to pull off your shot are slim to none.  This is a relatively minor visual addition that you'll probably not pay any attention to, since a large amount of it is common sense.  Similarly, the Refined Power Boarding System is still primarily governed by the Rebound Hot Spot system, meaning that you have a sense of whether or not you need to crash the boards based on the hot spot projected on the ground.  What's more, while you may wind up triggering a close up on players going for the ball more often, you're still not boxing out an opponent and preventing access to the rebound or locking down the low post.  You're simply hitting a button and hoping that your player grabs the ball before the other team does.   This lack of innovation also extends to seemingly copy and paste game mechanics on the court, which still have the same gameplay issues that has plagued the game for years.  For example, instead of fixing the inaccurate squaring up on an opponent at an angle or having defenders taking themselves out of a play by lunging for the ball on any steal attempt, the gameplay flaw is still included in the game.  Trying to raise or lower your hands to intercept passes is not included in this year's game.  Player AI also seems to have degenerated, with a number of AI players on both your team and your opponent's squads establishing themselves out of bounds during transitions or fast breaks.  One of the worst problems was seeing a player inbounding the ball with one foot out of bounds and the other shoe clearly on the court.  Having such blatantly inaccurate and flawed basketball play for one year is bad, but considering that this is the third year in a row that this has occurred, this is simply inexcusable.    Perhaps the gameplay issues are the reason why the online mode is so sparsely populated.  NBA 08 features a new, cleaner interface that will allow players to challenge each other in exhibition, own the court and three point shootout games, but it's extremely difficult to find someone willing to play a game with you.  In fact, when we last checked, there were only eleven players that were ranked on the leaderboards.  Either no one has ventured online, or they're still trying to get their heads around the lack of adjustments in the game.   It's obvious that the true focus of NBA 08 has been placed upon finishing the third installment of The Life story. While you can load a character from Vol.2, neither The Kid or Big W is the main character within this year's plot.  In fact, Coach T and the rest of the team play a much larger role this time around, with the coach's impending retirement at the end of the season setting the stage as a significant plot point.  Big W has been traded to another squad, and The Kid has been knocked out for the season with a knee injury, meaning that the fictional team needs to look to new players to step up.  As a result, players take on the role of The Youngblood, a new rookie brought onto the team.  However, don't expect to solely control this newcomer in The Life; this time around, you'll control the other members of the squad as well in different game situations, including previously seen characters like Shane Blanton and Jerome Hurd, as you try to turn your squad into a dynasty.   Coach T's retirement is part of the plot of The Life this time around. Once again, the story mode provides goals based on two tiers, team goals and showtime goals, which you need to complete to move on to the next mission or match.  Just like last year, you'll be given a couple of objectives, such as making jumpers with specific players, dishing out assists and preventing specific players from scoring.  By completing specific tasks, particularly some of the Showtime goals, you'll wind up unlocking player cards or jerseys.  It still winds up triggering a certain amount of neglect of your teammates on your part as you focus solely upon accomplishing your goals with a particular player.  However, the goal system has changed in a few ways.  First of all, whereas some of the goal sequences were too hard in Vol. 1 and too easy in Vol. 2, the difficulty scales to your skill level with the inclusion of an easy mode.  Now, you can eliminate some of the trickier objectives if you can't accomplish everything in a set time limit and move along in the storyline.   Another change is in the elimination of specific MVP points or character specific goals.  Whereas Big W had dynamic goals that would pop up during games, the team based nature of this year's title scratches this setup in favor of rotating between athletes on the squad.  Unfortunately, the largest casualty of this new setup is that you don't particularly feel invested in any one of the players on the squad.  The character development of Shane, Jerome, The Youngblood and even the Kid feels forced and bland, and the continual screaming of Coach T at his players gets old after a while, particularly when you don't have a sense of why he's so annoyed at an incredible performance you've made on the court.  After a while, you don't particularly care if the team establishes a dynasty, you solely play the mode to unlock additional items.  The drills that you are continually forced to go through are also rather stale.  Part of this issue comes from training camp, which lasts far too long, but the other part is constantly having to run alley oop drills at random sections of the game, which have nothing to do with the story.  It would seem like the designers could've put a few more options or selectable choices in the midst of the game instead of simply letting you set back and watch these cinematics or forcing you to do boring, repetitious drills.   NBA 08 is starting to show its age. Speaking of the cinematics and visuals, NBA 08 is really starting to show its age on the PS2.  For example, there are tons of jaggies, particularly on character models, faces vary between static and overexaggerated expressions, and there are tons of canned animations.  As a result, you frequently see players reacting seconds after a shot has been made because they have to finish their previous command strings, so some defensive reactions are half hearted attempts rather than legitimate moves. Crowds look horrendous as well, with extremely basic sprites that shimmy in the background.  Many of these problems haven't changed in three years, which only exacerbates how visually weak this title has become.   At least this year, NBA 08 finally features commentary by Kevin Calabro and Mark Jackson, which replaces the obviously missing play by play from last year's game.  While the added dialogue definitely makes the title more like a standard sports game, much of the commentary is delivered far later than the onscreen action.  As a result, you're not really gaining that much.  Crowd noise is pretty weak as well.  Sometimes you'll pull off a big play and get a weak response from the arena, which is just disappointing.Although the story has changed from Vol. 1 to Vol. 3, the gameplay has definitely stayed the same.  Flawed defensively, with unrealistic problems and uninteresting game modes, NBA 08 is the culmination of three years of neglected improvements of the basics of the sports franchise.  With much more development happening on the PSP and PS3 versions of the game, it's perhaps time to strip out the few interesting elements of this year's title that work (namely some aspects of the story mode) and let this title fade away.", "date": "Oct 5, 2007"}
