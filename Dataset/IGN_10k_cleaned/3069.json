You may perhaps interpret that as you will.  After all, the only time the series has not stood in the shadow of better games is when it was very first released, before Final Fantasy VII reshaped the North American RPG market.  Ever since, it has played something of a second fiddle, to FFVII, then Chrono Cross, and now the current crop of PS2 RPGs.  Nevertheless, it retains the same appeal as its predecessors.  The fantasy/western theme has always been good for a bit of quirky fun,  backed up by strong character design and music composition, and the dungeons are populated with more entertaining brain-teasers.  The series' first experiment with entirely 3D visual presentation has yielded mixed results, depending on your tastes, but what the series has always done right, Wild Arms 3 does as well.  With the PS2's RPG lineup clearing out this fall, then, this may be a good choice to tide yourself over until the next round of big names arrives in 2003.  It's a very traditional game, aside from its graphics, and that's what a fair-sized segment of the market would still like to play.  Gameplay Most of the game features in Wild Arms 3 are immediately recognizable from earlier games in the series, both good and bad.  The battle system has switched to free-roaming 3D areas, though, making positioning a more complex and yet less tangible factor.  Ranged and hand-to-hand attacks are affected by the Brownian motion of the characters around the battlefield, which is something to briefly take into account when planning attacks from round to round.  Standard weapon attacks are supplemented by special maneuvers and magic (called Arcana), both of which are powered by Force Points.  Characters have no fixed level of energy that powers secondary attacks -- rather, Force Points ebb and flow according to actions in battle.  Evading enemy attacks and successfully striking enemies gains Force Points (certain items can also raise the gauge), which are in turn spent on more effective attacks and support abilities.  This remains the combat system's strongest point, since it's never possible to completely run out of FP -- the option always remains to gain more through ordinary combat actions.  FP reserves also subtly affect the strength of regular attacks, so there's some advantage to be gained by holding back on spending that extra FP.  There's an automatic battle option available, which turns the player characters over to AI control, but I found myself not using it very often.  It works well for what it is, offering a decent selection of options for customizing the behavior of individual characters and creating better team strategies, but I remain leery of the idea of turning over control entirely.  It seems as if one can never get control back fast enough in the crunch.  The battle system moves swiftly enough even under manual control that it rarely grows too tiresome, anyway.  The dungeon design, as in Wild Arms past, is heavily focused on Zelda-style puzzle-solving, with a dozen different tools available (three for each of the four main characters) to manipulate objects in the environment.  There's a little less block-pushing this time out, and more creative applications of the different tools, making dungeons more than just a mindless slog through random monster encounters.  The game also employs a clever system for evading random battles -- it's easy to skip them, but the Encounter Gauge limits how often the party can do so.  Dodging more difficult enemies comes at a higher cost, so the game will eventually force you into combat, but there's less of a price for skipping easy, tedious encounters.  Field map exploration is an area of the game's progression that could stand to be tightened up a bit.  As usual, landmarks aren't immediately visible on the overworld map -- they're only revealed by a little radar search feature that has to be voluntarily triggered.  Poking around the world map trying to find out where to go is fun once or twice, but the appeal rapidly wears, thanks to continuous random encounters and frequently vague directions.  NPCs offering guidance have a nasty tendency to say ~it's to the south of here,~ or ~follow the setting sun~ and so on, which tends to leave you barking up the wrong tree and repeatedly triggering the search radar to no effect.  SCEA has long been famous for somewhat questionable localization of Japanese RPGs (cf. FFVII, Final Fantasy Tactics, the PlayStation Grandia, Star Ocean 2), but Wild Arms 3 shows its style settling down a bit.  The dialogue is solid and well-edited, if a little dry now and again, and there's some relatively subtle variation in the characters' personalities.  Clive has an arch, educated tone, for example, but it's not overplayed to the point of farce.  Virginia Maxwell, meanwhile, is blessed/cursed with the straightforward hero's role, but it's nevertheless nice to see a strong, intelligent woman taking the leading role in an RPG these days.      While it hasn't evolved a great deal as a gameplay package in comparison to its predecessors, Wild Arms 3 should still fill plenty of time for dedicated RPGers.  Aside from the central quest, enough to last the usual 30-40 hours, it has a boatload of hidden bosses and bonus dungeons, as well as more minor hidden odds and ends to dig up around the world map.  Furthermore, familiarity need not necessarily breed contempt -- players of the earlier Wild Arms games should find themselves right at home.  Graphics The designers of Wild Arms 3 decided to get a little creative with the opportunity to make their first realtime 3D game.  Rather than the traditional texture maps of something like Final Fantasy X, Wild Arms uses simple, bright colors, sharp black outlines, and a semi-transparent overlay that gives the characters a ~sketchy~ look.  It's nothing like the indistinct filtering of The Bouncer -- it's a texture overlay on the characters instead of a full-screen filter, so it doesn't affect the backgrounds.  In theory, I believe, this is supposed to result in something like Japanese animation through Sergio Leone's lens.  In practice, it's not quite that cool, but it doesn't look bad by any means, and the character designs give the graphics a big hand up.  The colors are bright, but not garish, and each member of the cast has a distinctive look of their own.  The lighting effects also work well with the flatter textures on the character models -- illumination from things like muzzle flash plays across them very nicely.  The character-driven cinematics are the visual high point.  In comparison, the battle and dungeon graphics are pretty pedestrian -- there are occasional spots of interesting architecture or impressive spell animations, but we've seen far better in games like FFX.  The continuously moving camera improves the presentation, though, more so than the usual static camera in turn-based RPGs.  Like the continuous motion in the Grandia games, it picks up the pace of action even when there isn't much actually happening.  Sound When Wild Arms' soundtrack is at its best, it's very good.  The better moments tend to be the quieter ones, limited to a little woodwind and acoustic guitar -- in other words, when the game makes the most of its Western influence.  The more of those sorts of sounds I heard, the more I wanted.  When it switches to traditional synthesized RPG tunes, the music doesn't prove nearly as suitable or effective, even if it does work out your speakers a bit more.  The series still hasn't made the leap to spoken dialogue (which, of course, isn't necessarily that bad a thing, given the voices in Grandia...) so it's left with a relatively limited selection of effects for this day and age.  Few stand out, although there's a nice mix of gunfire for the main party's signature weapons, and some of the bad guys do manage to present more than the usual thwacks and weird slimy noises.   And hey, even the weird slimy noises aren't bad...Wild Arms 3 is, as a rule, resoundingly not bad.  It's not up there with the A-list of the PS2 market, both past and future, but like its predecessors, it's a solid game with only a few bothersome flaws.  For example, I remain utterly perplexed by the inclusion of the search system -- I can't imagine anyone liking it in Wild Arms 2 -- but greater mysteries have surrounded other RPGs.  The Gummi Ship, say...We were talking about Wild Arms, though.  It's probably worth picking over Legaia 2, the other noteworthy RPG release of the moment, and with the genre drying up until the arrival of Star Ocean and Xenosaga next year (aside from the excellent Suikoden III), it stands as one of the better picks for fans this season.", "date": "Oct 16, 2002"}
