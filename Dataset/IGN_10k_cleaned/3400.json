The N64 was notoriously devoid of any respectable role-playing games, and since the release of GameCube in 2001, we've seen only a few moderately appealing RPGs. To date, there has been no original turn-based RPG released for GameCube. And, while that isn't about to change anytime soon, Sega does have a solution for us: Skies of Arcadia Legends. Previously a Dreamcast-only RPG, Sega's exclusive developer Overworks has taken the time to properly port it to GameCube with enhanced features. Not only does it offer up the same stellar gameplay that the Dreamcast featured, but it has in fact been tuned up and expanded with extra content.   It's the absolute best RPG for GameCube to date, and, despite its two year-old age, it's still one of the more impressive RPGs created for any console. If you haven't experienced the diversity of Skies of Arcadia, you are missing out on a splendidly crafted RPG.  The Facts  Classically styled RPG with turn-based battles, spells, numerous items, and all the trimmings Detailed storyline with new plot details Navigate the ~Skies~ in your airship and take part in randomly generated battles Explore six enormous lands ranging from deserts to the cold reaches of outer space Call upon the attributes of more than 70 weapons and 36 magical skills Cutomizable air ship crew -- gather up to 22 crew members to help defend or attacks Hand-to-hand and ship-to-ship battles feature   Improved battle engine New ~Wanted~ battles, characters, ultimate weapons, discoveries, side quests and more Fantastic soundtrack No progressive scan support  Gameplay Skies of Arcadia Legends is quite simply an enhances port of the beloved Dreamcast title by the same name. The ~Legends~ tacked onto the end of it signifies, not a whole new quest, but the general improvements. Considering the Dreamcast version didn't exactly see blockbuster sales, however, there's a strong chance that you've never played Skies, and if that's the case there's a lot you should be aware of. The Overworks-developed game is a mix of real-time exploration and turn-based battle sequences. Like the RPGs of old, Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior, the basic idea is to send a player out into the world to slay groups of enemies, gain experience, buy weapons and items, and accomplish something grand. Skies of Arcadia Legends adheres to all of those ideals. In many ways, it doesn't do anything new. However, it's the way it follows this otherwise traditional formula that makes it such a wonderful thing to experience.   You begin your quest with but a few party members. As lead character Vyse and his trusty female sidekick, Aika, you dock one of the evil Valuan's ships to take it over and grab some loot. As members of the Blue Rogues -- pirates that in Robin Hood fashion give to the poor and steal from the corrupted rich -- it's your whole life. In the process, you stumble into more than you bargained for. A young girl, Fina, has been taken captive, and by rescuing her you open the door to a whole new world of trials and tribulations. We shan't spoil the story for you, but trust us when we say it's actually quite charming and well directed to boot.    Skies, though dated, still has its pretty moments. As for the actual gameplay itself, it revolves around several different devices: turn-based ground and air battles, airship-to-airship duels, and real-time 3D exploration. The first two go hand-in-hand, drawing on a deep and respectably balanced battle system. You can choose to run, use an item, guard, attack any enemy, cast magic, use a special attack, and focus your power. It's the usual set of options, but there are a few unique traits to each. As you attack enemies, you will guild up spirit points, and when you have enough you can use a powerful special attack. To earn these special attacks, you must find Moonberries, which you find in treasure chests or enemies drop after fights. With those Moonberries you can surf into your menu screen and purchase a special attack. Because berries are so rare, this is a slow process. It's worth the wait, of course, as the attacks are usually quite powerful and come with a dramatic cinematic display too. It's nothing nearly as detailed as what was done in Final Fantasy X, for example, but it is a standout effort.      Meanwhile, the magic system is also pretty traditional. You will learn spells that draw on elemental powers such as fire, water, wind, and the like. It's not a new concept, but the way you learn spells is somewhat unique. Basically, the entire process revolves around moonstones: green for health-related powers, red for fire, purple for ice, etc. These stones are tied in to your weapons, given them elemental attributes. What's interesting is that you can change a weapon's attribute at anytime during a fight. The result is that you earn points for each element you used depending on how long you used it. So, it adds a certain strategy to the battles, as you should always be aware of the spells you want to learn. What we're trying to say is, we like it. Without it, the battles would be even more commonplace. There are other small details too, such as random counterattacks and random CPU AI that keeps you on your toes.   Under this format, you'll face a huge variety of very large boss figures that will test you to your wit's end. They are by no means easy if you haven't spent a considerable amount of time gathering experience on the battlefields. Like any good RPG, you'll also have to use a good deal of strategy -- healing party members, guarding, and knowing when to take risks. Usually bosses come with a pretty nice arsenal of signature attacks and, overall, they're pretty entertaining. It will become potently clear, however, if you're not strong enough to face off against them, though. This can be pretty discouraging if you just want to progress the story, but you must instead spend time leveling-up. It comes with the RPG territory, but you should be aware Skies isn't for amateurs.    Meanwhile, the airship duels are a completely different beast and add a nice bit of diversity to the available fights. It's your cannons against your foes' under Battleship-style (the board game) battle mechanic. It's hard to explain, but essentially you have one turn to choose whether or not you want to use evasive maneuvers, fire your main or, more powerful standard cannon, or focus for spirit points. Regarding spirit points, you need to manage them properly, which plays a huge part in these battles. If an enemy opens themselves up for an attack, and you only have enough spirit points to fire one cannon instead of several, you will miss a major opportunity. This is where strategy is necessary, which is what makes airship fights so refreshing. The only problem is that they are epic scripted events. You really don't just randomly run into a ~Wanted~ air pirate. Via the Sailors' Guild, you have to pay a price to get the details and go out searching for them. Depending on your tastes, this is both good and bad. On the one hand, you have control over these very daunting airship battles. On the other hand, you will rarely be surprised by them and they are far and few in between compared to regular battles.   Fairly tried-and-true, perhaps cliche at times, but always entertaining, these components are the major aspects to the game. It's a classically conceived RPG with a few deeper elements, such as the 3D exploration that will make you appreciate it. Topside, you can sail the skies of a huge overworld, piloting your very own ship and crew. Meanwhile, when you land in towns and investigate dangerous territory, it takes on a quasi-Zelda feel, where you have to solve some very basic puzzles. Both gameplay vessels are unpolished, the ship control stiff and the ground camera frustrating, but they serve a richer experience than the notorious top-down experiences we've seen in the past.      There are a lot of other details infused into Legends. There's an ongoing mini-game that has you sky-fishing with Vyse's special eye-patch, secret-ridden towns, and basic gameplay refinements that help a lot. For example, we are particularly fond of the ability to re-battle a boss after you lose. Why should you have to travel all the way back from your last save point? Lots of little things like this go a long way.   Overall, Skies of Arcadia Legends is certainly nothing revolutionary in the way of RPGs -- in fact it's downright formulaic in many ways -- but what it does, it does well. It's also the only truly great turn-based RPG that GameCube has at the moment. The point is, if you haven't played Skies of Arcadia yet, this is the perfect addition to your GameCube collection, despite its age.   Graphics There was once a time when people indicated that Skies of Arcadia on Dreamcast could pass for a PlayStation 2 game. Perhaps at one time that was true, but by today's standards and even with Skies of Arcadia Legends for GameCube this is not the case. The rendering engine and texture output is largely the same as it was on DC. The framerate has been smoothed out to a more constant 30, but for what is going on that is nothing impressive. Furthermore, there are definite relics of the Dreamcast-coded engine with the way textures are handled. Mip-mapping, a process that determines the detail and filtering on textures as they recede into the distance, is nearly identical. There is still a clear graduation of harsh lines, separating one level of blurry to the next.  The only real noticeable improvements come in the form of slightly more crisp textures (when they're up very close), tweaked animation, and beefed up character models. It's nothing that's going to make you think Skies is taking a hold of the GameCube hardware, unfortunately.  Lastly, for those few out there who were hoping for a crisper, more vibrant picture via progressive scan support, we're sorry to report it simply isn't there.   Sound Skies features a beautifully orchestrated opening piece for the menu screen, but unfortunately that's the only place you'll hear something so rich and high in quality. The rest of the adventure is filled with well-composed scores, indeed, but they're not nearly as moving as the fully orchestrated menu. Fortunately, the tunes are varied to some degree, so you won't get mind-numbingly tired of specific tunes. In the sound effects department, we would only describe what you hear as sufficient. There is basically no voiceover work, and the effects you hear while exploring and in battle are nothing extraordinary. They get the job done without any bit of awkwardness. For a game that was released years ago, I found myself strangely excited for the release of Skies of Arcadia Legends. The reason is simple: GameCube has no good turn-based RPGs! You know, good old-fashion, dungeon-crawling RPGs, where if I want to walk in a circle and stock up on experience, that's my business. For me, this is the best port of an aged product that GameCube has seen. Namely for the fact that it sits comfortably in the previously untouched RPG genre, but also because it isn't completely the same game. Overworks has spent some time fleshing out some of the story elements, adding in new side-quests, and polishing game mechanics. It's all subtle and minimal, but it's definitely noticeable.So, let me spell it out for you. RPGs fans must buy and play this game -- no questions asked. Get over the graphics and technical shortcomings; it's still a great game. For Dreamcast fanatics, if you were one of the cool 100,000 that owned the original, I suggest replacing your copy with this better version if you plan on playing it again sometime. Otherwise, the new additions probably aren't enough to warrant a whole new purchase.So you've got all that, right? Best GameCube RPG yet. Buy it now. Good -- get moving.", "date": "Jan 28, 2003"}
