Golf with Style AU Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/09/04/pangya-golf-with-style-au-review", "text": "Originating as a ~Fantasy Online Golf Game~, Pangya has been around on PC for a while now (check the official site for some great Engrish and earnest explanations), and has built up quite a following thanks to its anime-style approach, RPG-lite elements and robust gameplay. Now that it's on Wii, the online aspect - so big a focus for the PC version - has been lost, but pretty much everything else seems to be intact. What does that mean? It means you're going to hear the word 'pang' a lot. The game takes place on Pangya Island. Timing a hit well is a Pangya shot. Oh, and the currency of the game is Pang. At least the lead character isn't Pangy Pangenstein or something. That would just be silly.   No, at the beginning of the game you're given a choice of two characters - Hana (a.k.a. stereotypical anime girl model #4), who has red hair, huge eyes and a two fingered victory pose, and Scout (a.k.a. stereotypical anime boy model #1), who has so few unique features you'd be hard pressed to pick him out of a line-up of one. No matter though, because once you've picked your character, you can start getting some sweet pang (it's funnier if you think of the word as a contraction of 'poon-tang'), which then means you can buy your characters their own unique look, including revolutionary outfits such as 'schoolgirl', and erm, 'schoolgirl'. I kid, I kid. Well, not really, but the clothes are only one aspect of a decent in-game economy, which we'll get to later.     For now, let's talk gameplay mechanics. As you'd expect, Pangya! Golf makes full use of the Wii-mote as a golf club, but it also goes a few steps further. Switch to Free View before taking a shot, for instance and you can point at the screen to move about the course. Physically moving the Wii-mote towards the TV while holding B sees the camera moving along the course, while pointing to the top or bottom of the screen raises and lowers the camera's elevation respectively. You can also switch to Aerial View, which is a top down viewpoint of the course, and is navigated just as simply. You can even point and click where you want to hit the ball to quickly switch angles and clubs. Want to make an adjustment to the ball's spin? Just point at and select the ball in the lower left corner and you can make the changes (using the D-pad oddly enough). Other things to pay attention to are the lie of the ball (if you're in the rough you'll only be able to generate a percentage of the club's normal power, so take that into account when choosing how hard to hit the ball), the wind conditions (again, clearly displayed) and the undulations of the course.   Actually hitting the ball is a little different than you may expect. Draw back your virtual club to fill the power metre, and when you're happy with the level, hold A and swing. It's not nearly as natural a motion as you'd expect, but works relatively well, judging speed, straightness and follow through. Plus, you can also switch to a button press swing system in the options menu, which is what we did after getting sick of standing in front of the tele. Physically swinging is all well and good if you're playing Wii Sports or something similar, but in a game like Pangya! Golf you're playing for hours at a time, and after a couple of 18 hole courses, the novelty soon wears off. The good thing about switching to button presses (based on the old hit B to set your power, then hit B again to set your accuracy) is that you're still navigating the courses and setting up your shots using the pointing functionality of the Wii-mote, but you can do it from the couch rather than while standing up.   Whether you're swinging with the Wii-mote or just hitting buttons, the putting system also works well. Land on the green and you're presented with the usual grid-based array. Each square has a dot in it indicating the slope of that particular bit of green. If it's just left of centre, for instance, you know it's just a gentle slope to the left, whereas if it's at the very edge of the square on the left, you know it's much steeper. This system means you can get a good sense of the undulations of the green, and doesn't take long to get used to. Of course, you also need to factor in whether you're putting uphill or down - again, this is displayed on-screen.    So, we've established that the golf mechanics are pretty decent, but what's with all the zany characters, shopping bag caddies, crazy effects on the balls when you hit them, constant references to pang, strange pre-game conversations and so on? This is the love it or hate it aspect of the game. We're all used to golf games with RPG elements - levelling up, rivalries between players, that kind of stuff, but Pangya! takes it to a very cutesy anime-inspired place. At a basic level your character has stats in power, control, accuracy, spin and curve, but these can be influence by buying and wearing different clothes, winning and wearing different rings, buying wacky new clubs and using different caddies. It's shopping and golf, together at last, but fortunately you don't have to spend too much time with this side of the game if you don't want to. Perhaps you'd prefer to focus on playing, earning experience points with every win, and moving up through the levels, from Rookie all the way through to Master.   Unfortunately, we found that the progression system simply isn't as well paced as it should be. Earning pang to buy items and equipment is a pretty slow process, as is gaining enough EXP to go up a level. We want to actually see regular improvements in our base abilities, as opposed to slogging it out for ages waiting for something to happen. It's a big missed opportunity given how many things there are to tinker with in this game - you'd assume with all the clothes, clubs, balls, caddies and items, that progression would feel steady, but it's a little too slow for our liking. I guess this is a long haul game.     As mentioned before, the on-course antics are all pretty wacky - baseball bats as clubs, caddies with novelty oversize gloves, Dante wannabes strutting about in full leather outfits, a healthy helping of bizarre magical references, and so on, but thankfully you can play a pretty straight game of golf if you want thanks to the Stroke Play mode which consists of a whole host of 18 hole courses against a field of players. If crazy antics are more your thing though, there's the Pangya Festa mode which sees you character facing off in a series of one on one battles, complete with strange conversations beforehand. The other major single player mode is Match Play, which, like the Pangya Festa, is also a series of one on one battles. Throw in multiplayer for up to four players and you have a fair bit of content.   In presentation Pangya! fails to excel. The characters are all colourful, but a little generic and lacking in incidental animations, while the course themes are nicely varied, but many of the holes wind up feeling a little identikit. The camera angles after you've hit the ball - whether driving, chipping or putting, only occasionally show what you want to see, instead going for strange angles tracking the ball with no information about where it is relative to the course. Personally I want to be able to follow my shot the entire way, see how it's affected by the wind or by slice, and then adjust accordingly. But then, maybe I'm playing the wrong game. After all, every time I hit the ball it lets off fireworks.   The more we played, the more we warmed to Pangya!, but were still unlikely to go back to it. If youre an absolute golf nut who also loves a cutesy Japanese presentation, you could do worse, but the bottom line is, if youre only going to buy one golf game for Wii, youd be far better off just hanging out for Camelots We Love Golf instead of picking this one up.", "date": "Sep 4, 2007"}
