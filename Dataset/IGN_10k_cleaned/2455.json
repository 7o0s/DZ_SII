Everyone knew that eventually LucasArts would make a fighter with a Star Wars license. Putting Luke Skywalker in the same ring with Darth Vader is something every school boy and sci-fi fan has dreamed of for years, and Star Wars: Masters of Teras Kasi seemed to promise this. However, what no one expected was how pedestrian and uninspired it would turn out to be.  It starts out promisingly. Darth Vader has hired Arden Lyn, master of the Teras Kasi martial art, to assassinate Luke Skywalker and friends. And, with strong likenesses of Luke, Han Solo, Boba Fett, Princess Leia, and others, plus locations right out of the movies, I couldn't wait to hit the ring. Imagine my dismay when the fighting began.   Basically a combination of Tekken and Soul Blade, Masters is two different kinds of fighters in one. Each round starts in hand-to-hand mode, with a button layout similar to Tekken. Press a button, and you're fighting with weapons a la Soul Blade. This is fine, if derivative, but the real problem with the game lies in the control.  Fighters must have split-second response -- it's what made Tekken 2 so brilliant. Masters of Teras Kasi, however, feels like the characters are made out of lead, both in speed of response and animation. I ended up mashing the buttons more than one time hoping the harder I pressed the quicker they'd respond. No such luck. Watching the fighters move is almost like watching animated versions of the Kenner toys. Head tracking is poor and the movements are terribly stiff.  Special moves can add a lot to any fighter. While not as important as the control, they do make learning the moves more rewarding. The special moves in Masters, despite the possibilities involved with the characters, are frankly not very special. Boba Fett's big move is to shoot his blaster into the air. Oh, hold me back. Some of the lesser characters like Thok the Gamorean Guard can do some pretty cool things, like breathe fire, but that's about it.  The graphics are solid, and the fighters look a lot like their screen counterparts. And there some pretty cool hidden characters to be found as well. But playing Star Wars: Masters of Teras Kasi just isn't that much fun. Rent the Special Edition trilogy and keep playing Tekken 2.   Adam Douglas", "date": "Nov 20, 1997"}
