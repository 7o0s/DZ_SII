Pick up Astal and ask yourself if it is worth buying a $399 console to play. This is a crappy, derivative, 2D side-scroller with pretty graphics. The control is OK, the length is OK, the level design is OK. But that many ~OK~s don't even equal the sum of their parts when you play this dog.If you're nostalgic for the days of 16-bit, you may want to pick this out of the bargin bin, but you'd be better off just dusting off your Genesis.", "date": "Jan 2, 1998"}
