Coming to us from the French developer Microids, The Adventure Company has published this point and click journey.  It is set in Paris, France and players take on the persona of MacPherson, a retired private detective from America who is now living the life of an artist.  Hired by the beautiful Sophia Blake to take on this unique case, the clairvoyant MacPherson must try to discover who beheaded her sister and brother-in-law.  Along the way in this dramatic adventure, there will be many twists and turns, turning the plot into something straight out of Columbo.   The story is engrossing.  Right off the bat, you'll notice this isn't a game for children, as a nipple makes an appearance.  Also, the flashes of the murder that your psychic detective gets tend to be rather vivid and macabre.  As you progress through the game, you'll meet a variety of interesting and shady characters and be drawn into a tale that is both ridiculous and believable.  The acting is well done.  The desk clerk for the exclusive hotel is appropriately snooty and the Parisian police detective is suitably evasive.  Combined with rewarding cut-scenes and nice looking graphics, it gets high marks for being a notch above the curve when it comes to presentation.  The only thing I'd say is lacking is the way some of the environments are painted on.  Only things you can interact with in most locations have any sense of realism.  The rest, including patrons in a restaurant, are just drawn artwork.  This doesn't really detract from the beauty of the game though.   Post Mortem uses very simple point and click mechanics.  Hot spots appear whenever an item can be interacted with.  Footsteps reveal other areas you can travel to.  Right clicking will bring up the options menu and inventory.  All conversations are logged and any documents can be viewed as often as you'd like.  Also, MacPherson keeps a suspects/witness list with brief details about each person, perhaps giving you an idea of what to do and who to talk to if you get stuck.  The in-game map reveals any locations you can go to and new locations are added when you uncover that piece of critical information.  The map can be brought up at any time and players can travel instantly to any location on the map.  Another tool for information is the telephone, which can be used to call someone or request a telegram be sent.  It its entirety, the game is extremely simple to jump into and play without any direction.   Most of the game involves conversation.  MacPherson is given several dialogue choices when confronted with someone to talk to.  You can choose any of them, although some of them will bring the conversation to an end before you can choose any others.  Often, when this happens you can just click on the person again to find out additional information.  Other times, though, choosing a specific dialogue will end the conversation and you have no other way to talk to that person again.  This doesn't necessarily mean you are stuck though, as there are many ways to muddle through this game and closing one route may just open another.  It is not linear, as information doesn't have to be obtained in a specific order, but you can jump around and talk to whoever you feel like. What did you think of Post Mortem?    There are very few puzzles to speak of, which is probably the biggest drawback to this game.  These enigmas are somewhat original for a point and click adventure, but are eerily similar to puzzles you'd find in Dell's Puzzle Magazine.  For example, one involves comparing two pieces of artwork and marking what is different in the fake.  It isn't necessarily a bad thing that puzzles are of this type, but what is bad is that there are not enough of them.  Some are adequately complicated that they might be a small time sink, but with so few puzzles the game is actually fairly short.  Nothing is this game is too complicated that it can't be figured out with some time and effort.Post Mortem is another game in a series of games that had potential but falls short for one reason or another.  It is one of the best I've played in the last year, though.  The genre benefits from this title.  Pretty decent graphics and sound only serve to make the intriguing tale of murder and deception believable.  The dialogues are interesting and add a lot of the game.  You can explore and play the game however you like and there are many ways to pursue the investigation.  While its lacking on puzzles and this will leave you with a  feeling of dissatisfaction, it is nonetheless a worthwhile adventure game that will hold us over while we wait for THE adventure game.  If we wait for it, it will come, right?  Right??", "date": "Feb 25, 2003"}
