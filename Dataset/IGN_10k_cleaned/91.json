And what better spoof than for Yakko, Wakko and Dot to take on than the biggest movie of all time, Titanic? Big, fat, and full of disaster already, it's a perfect format to have the dogcatsomething kids take on. Unless, of course, you actually want a game.  In Gigantic, you play as Yakko, Wakko and Dot, who've been thrown in the sanitarium in a last ditch effort by Thaddeus J. Plotz (Chairman of the Board at Warner Bros.) to rid the annoying menaces of the lot completely. He's hidden all the films, awards, and movie posters around the lot -- and on an ocean liner, apparently -- and it's your job to take turns as each of the Animaniacs to get them back. Never mind the fact that as the game starts, you're actually already on the ship, and not in the sanitarium. Guess those kids move quickly.  It's not exactly like you should be surprised by what you see when you pop in Gigantic -- the graphics on the back of the box don't exactly trick you. If you think it looks like a Super Nintendo title, then you shouldn't be too surprised when, gasp!, it plays like a Super Nintendo title. In fact, the graphics look so much like a SNES title that you'll be wondering why you're even playing this on a PC at all. It's got the same logic of any of the 3rd generation titles at the end of the SNES era as well, where the designers had completely given up on why you do things, just that they had to be done. Why do the characters have to collect candy? Uh... because they couldn't collect coins, obviously. And why do sundaes make you invincible? Because... the combination of chocolate syrup and sugar naturally hardens skin into a rock-like shell for at least 20 seconds, dummy.  The graphics are flat as can possibly be, with a bit of slight parallax scrolling to keep you from going absolutely insane and believing that you've traveled back to 1985. The characters are drawn like the cartoon, but move at about the speed the Bionic Man jumps over a fence. Maybe a little slower. Apparently the ocean liner is taking a trip around the moon, because by the time it take an Animaniac to reach the ground after jumping, you'll have time to make yourself a sandwich, and we're talking with fresh bacon and a side salad. The weapons give a slight variety to the action, but not much more than that. Though it's fun to smash a rat with an anvil, hammer, or frying pan once, they really don't play or react enough to the environment to provide any lasting entertainment. What's much more entertaining, actually, is watching every object in the game, whether it be plant, animal or matter, explode into a billion of showering particles whenever you destroy it. If you've ever wondered what a rat would look like if it shattered, than your prayers have finally been answered.  Though you start out on the ocean liner, you can actually get far enough to jump onto other sets on the movie lot. Except for that part where you're supposed to be out at sea and the game's entitled Gigantic, it makes perfect sense. Or maybe it's just that the designers got bored having the characters freak out pogo style on wood-paneled ship scenes, and wanted them hopping frenetically on space sets for a while, to relieve some of the soul-shattering boredom. The game touches on the show slightly, but for the most part takes the characters out of the environments and puts them in Boring-ville USA, which is right near Horrorland, home of Skydive! and Extreme Watersports.  Most (read: all) of the action focuses on your collection of the film reels, movie posters, and awards hidden around the levels, but unfortunately, without a sense of actual exploration attached to the goals. In other words, when you've beaten a level, you feel a great sense of accomplishment not because you've tackled a tough challenge, but because it's one less level that you ever have to play again. Gigantic puts the gamer in the unhealthy position of actually loathing the process of playing a game, especially once they get over the fact that each new level isn't really new at all, just the same tedious tasks layered with a new background. About two levels into the game you begin to feel a slight itching, and by level five, when you've already played as all three members of the team, you begin to get a pounding sensation at the back of your neck. You should expect that feeling to grow slowly stronger as you continue through the game, and by level eight you should be ready to catch any hairs that begin falling out of your scalp. There's only one solution to the problem -- stop playing. You should soon find that the room becomes a little more logical, and with an hour of Quake you should be up to a healthy speed in no time.  I shouldn't criticize too harshly, though. Gigantic actually accomplishes a feat that even Titanic couldn't pull of. It gets you to root for the icebergs.  -- Vincent Lopez  PS -- Yes, the nurse is in the game. Yes, they yell ~Hello Nurse!~ No, it doesn't make the pain go away.", "date": "Aug 17, 1999"}
