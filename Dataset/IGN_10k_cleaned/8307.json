But no one wants to wade through a syrup of slow tutorials, tedious conversations and dull cutscenes either. Great as games like Metal Gear Solid and Okami are, they could learn a lot about how to start off a game from God of War II.    Sony's sequel has a real Hollywood blockbuster of a beginning - or, more accurately, a Hollywood blockbuster trailer, with an adrenaline-charged taste of the entire game bunged at you in just the first few minutes. Barely before you've flicked the stick, the screen fills with the Colossus of Rhodes - a statue the size of a mountain, with angry, piercing blue eyes and an equally miffed demeanour.   Nick Icarus's wings to reach other areas of the game. He's no fan of Kratos either, God of War II's returning anti-hero, and bashes his huge hand palm-down right next to our tattooed warrior, sending shockwaves through the ground that send smaller enemies flying to their deaths. When he doesn't find what he's after, he flexes his fingers into nooks and crannies you're hiding in - you're roughly the size of one of his fingernails. Like a pet hamster hiding under the bed, you watch this huge hand swipe back and forth, not quite sure if it's going to reach you.    This ten minute introduction - which encompasses everything from fighting mere mortals to discovering the boss's weak spot to finding a crumbling wall to escape through - is an accurate sample of what's to come. God of War II, like the first game, is superbly paced, with action and eye-frazzling set-pieces around every crumbling stone corner. Puzzle sections in vast empty chambers, with only your echoing footsteps for company, are quickly followed by a torrent of enemies to slice through. Just as you let your guard down during an uneventful cavern trek, you're jolted from complacency by a decorative statue unexpectedly bringing a foot down on top of you. Cutscenes are short and control of Kratos is rarely taken out of your hands, which serves to bond you with your revenge-fuelled gladiatorial grump and all of his strengths and weaknesses. Even the Pegasus rides - so far removed from the usual God of War experience - are as ballsy and bloodily brilliant as the rest.   This giant titan is solid as a rock but Kratos still has a pop. Kratos' return from the original God of War is a welcome one. Yes, you could say this is fairly generic gaming - while everything is supremely polished, with an inspired ancient Greek setting and superb combat, you still follow a pre-determined path - puzzles and fights are simply there to make that path more entertaining and slow you down. But Kratos is a wildcard. He's an anti-hero, driven by a desire for power - rescue missions to save innocent characters more often than not end up with him sacrificing them for personal gain. He's tough to like, but when surrounded by the brutality and evil of his existence, you want him to succeed on his quest. Just.   The game sticks to its guns (well, Athena's Blades) in many ways. Bloodshed and survival are key to the gameplay, and you feel the pressure of both constantly. Enemies aren't just killed, they're butchered. Finishing moves allow you to slaughter stunned, swaying enemies in a variety of ways, from beheading them to repeatedly smashing their head in a door.     Boss battles are proper tests of skill and endurance that gradually deplete the magic and health of you both. When the boss finally falls - generally just when your health bar is almost empty - you have a split-second to finish them off, using a series of button presses. Strike X and Kratos sinks in the sword. Half-rotate the left analogue stick and Kratos swivels the blade into the wound. Circle the stick and he wrenches his sword out with a fountain of blood.   Perseus is invisible to begin with so follow him by watching the water. Not only is it vicious, it's heart-stoppingly tense: with battles so long and enemies so tough, it really does feel like life or death. This is war: for all the game's linearity, nothing's made simple for the player. When you're trudging through a snowstorm, you can hardly see the path ahead. When a hero of Greek mythology unexpectedly gets you on your back and pushes a blade against your chest, you need to react within a second of the sudden prompt to hammer the circle button to shove him off. Fail and you're dead.    The new weapons are a mixed bag. You'll rarely return to the somewhat clunky Spear of Destiny or Barbarian Hammer. But the Atlas Quake is a gratifyingly destructive display of Kratos' rage that's absolutely necessary for the game's later (and, arguably, unfairly long) scraps, and the Blades of Athena are as satisfying as ever. As with the original, an array of upgradeable attacks and blocks are allocated to the buttons, and there's an evasive roll on the right analogue stick. The key to survival is to charge into an attack then roll away. The secret of Kratos' majestic death-dealing is this control the player has: there are no fixed animations, no being left flailing with your sword while your enemy reduces you to a small pile of ash.   The Blades of Athena are as deadly as ever. And with a rich source of Greek mythological Gods and myths to borrow from, there are vast numbers of enemies and powers to defeat. From old foes like Medusa to new blade fodder such as giant-sized Cyclops and triple-headed Cerberus, the variety is remarkable. The environments, too, are picture postcard beautiful. Kratos treks through deep valleys, around glistening temples, along the harnesses of horses the size of small planets. The on-rails camera means that every setting is shown off to its full potential, with swooping pans and long-lens shots - and guarantees you experience everything the developer intended. No scare or pre-scripted moment is wasted; no statue or mountain is allowed to pass by without showing off its sheer scale.    Kratos might wield his Blades of Athena as effortlessly as a magician shuffles a pack of cards, but his power and stature are frequently overshadowed by the sheer size and power of his Godly enemies and the seeming hopelessness of the quest ahead. Later on you interact with gods that make the Colossus of Rhodes seem as intimidating as a puppy on a pillow. At one point, Kratos sits in the palm of Atlas, a God larger than the Earth itself. It's this sort of scale that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout this entire astonishing experience.Little of the core gameplay has been changed for this sequel  the combat, huge-scale settings and beautiful cinematography of the first game returns, but with a whole new quest. Its still near flawless in design and structure: a game that puts you on a path and lets you follow it, concentrating on smart, bite-sized puzzles and enjoyable, brutal combat  with some magnificent views along the way. Its got the Hollywood beginning, but, unlike many blockbuster films, never descends into cheap thrills and action. The quality remains throughout. The PS2 might be on its way out, but the great games keep coming. This is one of the greatest.", "date": "Mar 30, 2007"}
