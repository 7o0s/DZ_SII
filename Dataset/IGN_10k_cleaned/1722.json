But it seems that the buck has stopped at Bottom of the 9th '97.  Not saying that this game is horrible, but it is missing a lot of features that just make the game bland. The lack of an MLB license is one of them. But perhaps one of the most annoying factors in the game is the load time. It seems that every time you want to switch the options, put in a relief player, or simply start the game, you're greeted with a load screen with a blimp on it. Argh!  Beside these minor aggravations, Bottom of the 9th '97 does however have a few redeeming qualities. The batting interface is one of them.  Rather than just swinging at a ball, batters use a rectangular box scan their strike zone. Batters also have different of batting skill: the better your batter the bigger your box. This separates the crap batters from the real star players.  Another cool feature is the Scenario Mode. This mode enables a player to recreate pinch situations without having to play through all nine endings. For example, imagine being in the top of the ninth with the score being Cincinnati 0 and Atlanta at 1. John Smoltz is at the mound and your preparing to close off the inning, what are going to do?  But when you get down to the dirt, this game simply lacks the graphics and gameplay you would expect in an average baseball game. Not to mention, the game was a little late coming out of the dugout this year as well. Sorry, but this one rides the pine this season.", "date": "Sep 19, 1997"}
