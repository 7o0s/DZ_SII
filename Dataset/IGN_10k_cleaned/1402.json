{"name": "Deep Raider", "name_review": "Deep Raider", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/25/deep-raider", "text": "Action games come and go.  Due to its very nature, this type of product's doomed from conception to lack the wealth of content possessed by its strategy, sports or simulation-minded peers.  Hence the reason you're seeing so many value priced, insta-thrill titles flood the shelves.  Folks just aren't willing to pay top dollar for even a groundbreaking 3D blastathon in this era.  So you've got to wonder what independent outfit Cyberscape Graphics was smoking when they concocted a scheme to shovel an expensive lemon like Deep Raider onto the public.  Everybody loves the ladies.  But ever since Lara Croft hit the scene, the last thing anyone's asked for from their games is another stereotyped female heroine.  Regardless, leading lady/Taiwanese interpretation of  leggy blonde Jennifer Connors steals the spotlight in this epic underwater shooter.  And although she's joined by helpful partners like a dolphin and ray, the cast of characters leaves something to be desired.  Still, what did you expect from a title that brags how ~friendly and wise jellyfish will appear at critical locations to provide you with useful hints?~   In theory, the underwater theme could've made for an interesting jaunt.  Levels are large, open spaces populated with schools of fish, broad canyons, whirlpools, kelp and other aquatic decor.  Mostly, though, players spend time swimming around without a clue as to which direction they should be heading for.  The radar screen that can be brought up is small and largely useless, and the map's not much help either, as it only shows the layout of locations already visited.    Furthermore, unless aimless wandering interspersed with battles against oversized sea critters is your cup of tea, this title leaves much to be desired.  Spit and polish are nonexistent.  It's like a cheap thriller based on 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, from the laughable plot to the inhumanly awful dialogue, botched translations and outdated cutscenes.  A ramshackle 3D engine ties everything together.  Even though rock walls are generally solid to the touch, these textures develop cracks and seams, letting you see miles into the distance through what should be solid terrain.  Primitive shoot n' move gameplay with no intensity also consigns this cumbersome package to the bottom of the briny deep.  Yet surely there's something to recommend the game as a purchase, right?  Well, funny you should ask.  As part of the deal, a USB JoyMouse device is included in the box.  While this peripheral's perfectly functional with Deep Raider and other interactive entertainment programs as a gamepad (provided you tweak configuration settings a bit), it also doubles as a mouse.  Therefore you can sift through applications using a console style controller.  Why anyone would care to do so is beyond me, but the snazzy lil' bonus gift helps offset the high price tag that's attached.  Regardless, it's impossible to recommended this 2 in 1 combo.  Poor action games and generic peripherals can be purchased separately and for far less at a local retailer.  Now that excellent shooters like Space Invaders and devices such as Interact's Piranha Pad PC have come down in price, you'd have to be a complete loser to waste almost fifty bones in order to acquire a comparable package somewhere else.  Besides, even the now ancient Sub Culture's still a thousand nautical miles ahead of Deep Raider in terms of technology and fun factor.  Swim clear of this waterlogged disaster, and don't say we didn't warn you.  -- Scott Steinberg      Want to share your opinions with the world?
