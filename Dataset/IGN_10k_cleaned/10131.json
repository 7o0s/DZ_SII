{"name": "WWF Attitude", "name_review": "WWF Attitude", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/08/06/wwf-attitude-3", "text": "Just like movie sequels, the successors to already established games have a lot riding on them. The expectations have been set, the levels raised, the perceptions crystallized. With WWF Attitude, Acclaim and its Salt Lake City Studio (formerly Iguana West) have orchestrated one of the most highly specialized wrestling games ever. With more than 30 star wrestlers, 15 single-player modes, and 21 multiplayer modes, a deep, intricate Create-a-Player Mode, and loads of generic and unique moves for each wrestler, WWF Attitude is a ferociously ambitious game that succeeds in nearly every way.  Gameplay First things first. Which wrestlers can you play right off the bat? Here's the list:  The Rock Stone Cold Steve Austin Ken Shamrock The Big Bossman X-Pac Val Venis Owen Hart The Undertaker Goldust Kane Mankind D'Lo Brown Christian Taka Michinoku Al Snow Bradshaw Mark Henry Brian Christopher Jeff Jarrett BA Billy Gunn Gangrel Triple-H Mosh Steve Blackman Dr. Death The Road Dogg Edge Thrasher Droz Faarooq  Ten other wrestlers are available after players unlock them. Let's just say that the WWF Women's champion Sable (who is now suing the WWF) and Chyna, among other well-known players, are hidden not too deep underneath the first layer of Attitude.   Not to crush your bubbles or anything, but the wrestlers in Attitude play a lot like they did in WWF Warzone. The changes from the first title to this one are subtle, not drastic. So, if you've played the first game and know the moves, you'll feel right at home.   Having said that, the amount of animation sequences for each wrestler has doubled, and so has the total number of moves, maxing out at 150. The most significant additions to the gameplay deepen the gameplay, providing good reason for those who own Warzone to buy Atittude. Players will find that pulling off throws and unique moves are far more susceptible to reversals than ever, adding an extra layer of skill-based play. To deepen the groove even more, players can counter obvious attacks and fake unconsciousness. Get up moves add to the strong list of about 10 moves per character (on average), as do the number of moves wrestlers aim at downed opponents. Also, each wrestler here has a unique finisher, a set of trademark moves, and a specified move set.   Interesting changes in Attitude that I personally like are couched in the rope action. In Warzone, the ropes were stiff and unrealistic. While they may look weak in the intros, they work well during play. Hit R2 and bounce off the ropes followed by a clothesline slam! It works extremely well. What's even better is the opponent's ability to counter it, too. Event the AI counters this 50% of the time with surprising awareness. The in-game ropes bounce realistically and have few of the clipping glitches that accompanied Warzone. Not only can players throw each other out of the ring, leap off the turnbuckle, and wrestler on the arena floor like last year, they can walk all the way to the entrance area.   Some problems I had early in the game occurred in the multiplayer modes. Oftentimes I couldn't get my wrestlers to face the opponent I wanted him to, which made a usually unfair fight even more uneven. In essence, the targeting system focuses in on one guy up until a certain distance and then it switches, but in a multiplayer match or even in Career mode, when a third player comes into the ring, the targeting problem can take off a lot of needed health. The targeting system should enable tracking on the closest opponent that gamers choose to face.  Other problems I faced in playing WWF Attitude are in the moves. Unlike fighting games, such as Street Fighter, Tekken, or Virtua Fighter, the button combinations are ridiculously long-winded. A good learning curve resides in them, making the first couple of hours of your experience a simple hit-and-kick bout. And even when you learn them, they're slow, and force you to into vulnerable positions. Example: you're playing Stone Cold (surprise!) and you wind up trying to pull off a Samoan Drop or a Shoulderbreaker. In the mean time, your opponent is kicking the poop out of you and slamming your face into the mat. These moves may look great once you learn them, but the move system is difficult and slow at best.  Gameplay Modes Any game has its fair share of problems, and certainly the moves can be learned with enough practice. Luckily, in this puppy, you'll have loads of modes in which to practice them! Acclaim loaded this game up with so many modes of play that any casual wrestling fan would be stunned, not to mention the hard-core monkeys!  The many modes are:  SINGLE-PLAYER Versus Tag-team Tornado Two-on-one Three-on-one Lumberjack (one guy is in the ring with you, and as many as 20 AI opponents are outside the ring. They have no alliances and will pummel anybody who goes outside and then throw them back inside the ring when they're done) Gauntlet Tag-team Gauntlet Survivor series Royal Rumble Battle Royale War Stable Match (four guys from your team meet up with four guys from the opposing team, with one team in the ring at a time. With war rules, not Tag-team rules.) Triple threat (First one to pin anyone else in a three-way match wins) Three-way Dance (Last one standing wins) MULTIPLAYER All of the same modes are available in Multiplayer as Single-player. The only differences are options for tag-team, cooperative or competitive. There are 21 Multiplayer modes total.  Unlike last year's version, the PS version of WWF Attitude is exactly like the Nintendo 64 version in strict gameplay terms. They're the same. The only differences here are the amount of movies and FMV, which the PlayStation version has more of because its on a CD-ROM, not a cartridge. What does this mean? PlayStation owners who were upset at missing Royal Rumble, will be happier this year. Also, make sure to get yourself a multitap, so you can play four-player bouts as well as 1-8 round robin tournaments.  No one does it better than Acclaim when it comes to Create a Player modes. This year's model is so much more meaty than Warzone's, it's stunning. There are five types of bodies to choose from, and changes in eyes, head shape, mouths, noses, hair types, mid riff areas, legs, and clothes on every part of the body. Now players can actually write anything they want on their sleeves, legs, backs, and chests of their new wrestlers. Another new feature is the Edit Move Set. Gamers can create a player and then create a set of moves or mix a set of moves from two different wrestlers. This adds to the already huge Create A Player mode that no other game can touch. The level of selection is simply awesome. When Craig and I were on the site together, we simply got lost in the Create a Player mode for hours before playing.   Adding to the fantastic Create A Player mode is the Create a Pay Per View mode! Whether you're into the new rings, Raw is War, Nitro, or old styles such as Wrestlemania, gamers can now create their own rings and arenas. Players get the chance to create an eight-match card, placing any character in the ring against anyone they chose in any ring they want. They can choose the ring, colors, lights, ring apron, banners, and a few more selections. This doesn't exactly affect the gameplay directly, but it brings another feature into fold, immersing gamers into modifying and personalizing their games. Graphics Acclaim got down to business with the visuals in Attitude. Filled with a jaw-dropping amount of textures, the company looks as if it's simply doubled or even tripled the amount seen in WarZone. At first site, Attitude still looks very much like Warzone, as they both use soft skin textures and photo-realistic face textures. My biggest disappointment was The Rock, whose face looks like it was smashed by a steam roller and fired in a kennel and then remade through plastic surgery. I mean it barely looks like him at all. But hey, I guess I've been looking at too many Dreamcast games and PS2 demos. (It does sound and move and feel like him, which are in the end the most important things.) The abundance of textures really shows up when you go to create a player. There is so much to choose from! Five body types, changes in eyes, nose, mouth, faces, writing on the clothing, it goes on and on.  Thankfully, Acclaim has created outstanding FMV movies and nearly perfect in-game intros -- some of the best I've ever seen. With the intro movie, Acclaim has honed what is sometimes an ugly, bawdy naked-person slam fest in to a well-choreographed possible entre into the Sundance Festival. Working each of the most popular stars into a fast-paced MTV twitch video, Acclaim creates a brilliantly accurate mood of tension, aggression, and sex appeal. Yes, sex appeal. This last one thanks to Sable, who shows up undressing in one shot, and in another, the closing sequence of the intro movie, you simply see her eyes, and then a fadeout. It's hard not to get excited about playing after that.   There are some problems that many players will notice right off the bat too, one of which I already mentioned. Despite the overall improvement of the graphics, the character face textures are, more often than not, crude representations of the real players. In the case of the rock, it's disappointing, but with other players, it's just funny. Stone Cold looks mostly like Stone Cold, Faarooq looks great, but with wrestlers such as HHH and Bad-@ss Bully Gun it's pure entertainment. In addition, players will notice faults in the rope when wrestlers enter a ring, and noticeable collision detection problems throughout a fight. Hands go through faces, legs kick through shoulders, and sometimes a sock in the face that looked like it misses knocks you flat. It's better than last year, but there are still problems.  Still, the character models themselves are seamless and excellently crafted. They are, well don't get me wrong here, beautiful. Just like last year, the wrestlers move phenomenally well. The clean moves created by Acclaim's motion capture department are the best of any wrestler in the business. The moves are quick in execution and smooth in movement. What's more, transitions between move animations are clean and well executed.   Other notable additions to this year's game are a moving (well, sort of) crowd, individualized intros for each wrestler, and a fantastic set of rope physics. With a few exceptions, the overall graphics, motion capture, textures, and models in Attitude are solid as a...~rock.~  Sound In simple wrestle speak, the sound rocks! Acclaim made huge leaps and bounds with the exquisite variety of sound threaded into the aural fabric of Attitude. Just the sheer, high level of sound production is worth mentioning on its own. Using a dedicated team of in-house music enthusiasts, the team sampled dozens of sounds from the real McCoy. Each wrestler's own pain, mercy sounds, grunts, taunts, slanders and brags were captured and digitized for this game. What's more, each and every theme and intro song is perfectly represented in every intro, creating an accurate portrayal of the TV shows.   But that's just the beginning. While the crowd may look a little better than last year (OK, last year's crowd was a flat texture. It was dead and lousy), the sound of the crowd this year is sheer brilliance. Random cries of joy and scorn, each soaked in beer and adrenaline, are belted out with a perfect sense of timing and placement. The crowd itself is, in a sense, a player, as it aids the momentum of each player, and swings often from foe to foe.   And then there are the keystone cop announcers, Shane McMahon and Jerry ~The King~ Lawler, who call the game in their own ~unique~ way. That is to say, they are themselves, in turn goofy, unrepentant, stupid, accurate, and timely. They go so far as to argue with one another. In the past, the timeliness of announcers such as say, Madden in EA's famed football game, are out of synch. Here, these goofballs are both in synch, funny, and can blather all day long without repeating themselves. It's funny just listening to them. It should be mentioned that as the TV shows progresses and changes, so do the things these guys say. So not everything is perfectly up to date, but we can forgive Acclaim for that given the long production times.Like it or not, wrestling is here in the biggest way. Thankfully, Acclaim is here too, taking it seriously, and providing gamers with a phenomenal selection of modes and creative alternatives in WWF Attitude.Now all they have to do is make the actual wrestling more fun. When the wacky move system is made more accessible then we'll really be happy. I really can't play (and enjoy the game) for more than a few matches because it's too easy to perform standard moves, and ridiculously time-consuming to execute the killer ones. Plus, even if you press them in correctly, you may already be upside downa and getting the people's elbow in all the wrong spots. Although I prefer fighting over wrestling games, it's difficult to overlook the kinds of action seen in this puppy. Throws, reversals, counters, turnbuckle slams, rope work, and out-of-ring play. Oh, and weapons. These guys have done their homework, and they have the best damn wrestling game on the PlayStation.
