Since the launch of the Wii and the debut of the Virtual Console, we've been both surprised and confused at the overwhelming number of forced-scrolling shooter games that have arrived for download in Nintendo's Wii Shop. Just about two weeks ago, though, a blog post by Hudson executive Takahashi Meijin revealed that the company may be planning a new Wii-exclusive installment in the Star Soldier series  indicating that a positive reception of past Soldier games on the VC would encourage such a project to become reality much more quickly.    We knew that the retro downloads for Nintendo's Wii would provide both the Big N and its partners with a valuable source of marketing information, based on how many gamers put down their Wii Points for each individual offering. And now it appears Hudson's been keeping close tabs, all along, on the digital sales of Super Star Soldier, Soldier Blade and Blazing Lazers.   It's now time to keep tabs on another. The original installment in the series, the game that created the name, has now been made available. Coincidental timing? Not likely. This first ever Star Soldier is here with a mission, to continue to gauge gamers' interest in Hudson's classic shooter series. Unfortunately, though, any master marketing scheme lurking in the shadows may be doomed  by the simple fact that this first Star Soldier from 1986 really isn't that good.   A mid-level mini-boss, the Big Blue Face.  You are the pilot of the starship Caesar. You've been called to command the compact craft through 16 regions of invaded space, where the out-of-control supercomputer Starbrain has taken over, threatening the peace of the cosmos. It's an intimidating assignment, given the two harsh penalties you'll suffer for failure.   The first is for dying  if you collide with any enemy ship or stray bullet during the course of a level and your ship explodes, you won't respawn on the spot. You'll instead be thrown back to the beginning of the level. And the second is for not being fast enough  if you don't attack and defeat the flying Starbrain boss at the end of each stage within the span of just a few seconds, the brain will escape. And you'll be thrown back to the beginning of the level.   It's actually possible to play Star Soldier for hours on end  without even dying  and stay locked into an endless loop of attacking the same level over and over again. You simply have to be successful in destroying each of the 16 regions' Starbrain bosses before you're allowed to move on. There's no running away from your mission.   There is, however, running away from your mission. Temporarily. Star Soldier's got an interesting hiding mechanic that allows you to duck underneath background objects to escape from incoming fire. You can attack a swarm of ships, quickly descend to take cover while they return fire, then pop out again to finish eliminating them  that's pretty cool. Unfortunately, though, it's also totally random.   You have no control over when you duck under cover and when you don't. There are background objects like space stations, floating asteroids and steel girders all over the place, but none of them clearly indicate that you're able to hide behind them. You'll only know after it's happened, automatically, and usually right when you didn't want to hide at all  because you can't use your weapon from a concealed position.   It's all very frustrating, and ultimately not that fun. The interactions with the overbearing background elements that obscure incoming bullets by their presence and sometimes forcibly take you out of the action are annoying, as is being forced to repeat the same stage again and again, on occasion, when you haven't flown an absolutely perfect run. Star Soldier's a classic in many ways, and an important game in the history of development for vertical shooters, but it's just a bit too outdated and irksome to still hold up today.Takahashi Meijin may not get the positive feedback he's hoping for when sales data comes back for Star Soldier. But, hopefully, the number of downloads for this game's far superior sequels will still encourage him and Hudson to continue the series with a new installment for the Wii. Super Star Soldier, Soldier Blade and Blazing Lazers are all vastly improved shooter experiences that are already available in the Wii Shop, and priced at only 100 Points more than this NES effort  we'd strongly recommend you download one of those three titles instead, and leave this game where it belongs, back in 1986.", "date": "Aug 4, 2007"}
