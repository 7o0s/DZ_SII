A few more could arguably be tagged onto that list, but those are really the top dogs. With the exception of Driver, the most memorable racing games were straight up racers. On PlayStation 2, racing games aren't necessarily what they used to be. Take Midnight Club: Street Racing for instance. It's not really a straight racing game by any means, it's a tailored, specialized, illegal form of racing. And it's top notch, too. Midnight Club brings back a simple arcade-style racing and weaves in mission-based and team-based gameplay  it's a fast, supernatural kind of driving that melds some really great proven coin-op elements with PC style gameplay under one hood.   Gameplay The idea behind Midnight Club is that racers take to the street at night and hook up with other like-minded folks for no-holds-barred racing through the streets of London and New York. Your car, no matter which one, is totally modified  lowered to the legal limit, heavy with speakers and expensive sound systems, perfectly tinted, chromed, detailed, and rigged with the most exquisite and expensive hub caps on or off the market. Everyone you meet has some kind of attitude, and gives you lip. They're nasty and they try to ruin your car. They laugh in your face if you lose. In contrast to Rockstar's other racer, Smuggler's Run, which tries to have attitude, Midnight Club simply has it.  Gamers get the chance to start a Midnight Club career in ~Career~ or venture into single or two-player games with ~Arcade.~ Career involves a long-term commitment to the streets, enabling you to race against others, and by winning, you receive their cars. As you make your way through the once cloaked circuit of midnight club racers, you earn all sorts of killer vehicles. In fact, you could win up to 17 different cars altogether, ranging from the Pirahna (which looks like a VW GTI), a pimped out pick-up truck, a ~Crusero,~ taxi cabs, police cars (from both NY and London), British Double Decker Busses, NY busses, and cars that resemble Nissans, Hondas, Toyotas.   Arcade Mode is where the two-player goodness is found. Players can burn rubber through the cities in game such as Capture the Flag, Cruise, Head to Head, and Waypoint. Even against the computer Capture the Flag was a blast. Against a human it's even more compelling. It's too bad these modes weren't four-player, they would have been that much more awesome.    The idea is to win as many cars as possible from one person. Each time you beat a character, like for instance, Emilio, you take his next best car, until you have all three Cruseros, categorized by ~bueno,~ ~excellente,~ and ~magnifico.~ Once you have beaten all of the bad-@sses in New York, you face off with the best of that city, and the move on to London, in which you face even faster, meaner racers. Each race follows checkpoints that follow a completely differently line, or pattern, each time, and that cover each city map. You can take any route you please, but you have to come in first.    Midnight Club also plays very much like two games you might be familiar with: the arcade game San Francisco Rush and the PC title Midtown Madness, which just happens to be an Angel Studios game. Cars reach phenomenal speeds, and can peel across town, taking large loads of damage before crumpling into piles of smoky scrap metal. Most objects are destructible, such as lampposts, other cars, mailboxes, etc. -- you even run people down (they don't die, they just call you names and perhaps for an ambulance). You have acceleration, brake, and an E-brake, which comes in handy just about 99% of the time, and the rest is just mad skills.   Both city maps are laid out with many striking similarities to the real locations, but they are also designed with secrets up the wazoo. Players can smash through glass buildings to cut corners, they can take detours through underground parking lots, across parks, and they can jump from rooftop to rooftop if they know where to drive. You can even see real towers and buildings from real life. The point is that each city map is riddled with secret paths and shortcuts, but also real life landmarks, too. What this element brings to the racing is almost immeasurable, because the races are no longer just races, they are exploratory environments that simply fun to explore and exploit. Add in the fact that both city maps are absolutely huge, and take hours to learn, and that cops come after you, in addition to same-side and oncoming traffic, and you've got tension, exploration, speed, which equals one hell of a game.   Midnight Club doesn't take too long to become accustomed to. The control is relatively easy, though each car drives a little differently, but the speed...wow. Once Angel Studios got the frame rate percolating at 30 frames a second, the sense of speed became almost unbelievable. These cars can move. I experienced no slowdown whatsoever.   Graphics Although the first pictures of Rockstar's PS2 games looked a little sketchy back in April, Midnight Club in particular really looks like a next generation title. The cars gleam with reflections, and they have totally solid levels of detail. The cars you drive actually take damage, and you'll see realtime deformation take place, after smashing into a Fed Ex truck or a minivan. There are dozens of cars driving all over the city, and nothing pops in or even fades in. Granted, there isn't as much detail in these cars as say, GT3, but the game still looks damn good, and it's certainly worthy of the next generation label.   Most of the races...well, all of the races take place at night, and while you can set the time of night (dawn, night, dusk, midnight), it's all quite black and dark. Players can set the weather, too, including cloudy, rain, foggy (hah! That's easy), and clear skies.   Sound For those who live on the bleeding edge of techno, trance, and house, Derrick May, Surgeon, and Dom and Roland have contributed five tracks each to this game, and they all fit the driving experience like a glove.   The library of crashing sounds, screeching tires, and big, burly engines is also well produced and really adds to the experience. I just can't explain how important it is to hear a burly V8 rev up, or the sound of my little Pirahna whining when I start a race. Each car sounds differently and none of them, thankfully, have annoying qualities, where the high pitched engine sounds more like a sewing machine just caught on fire. These cars sound right on the money.   It also should be noted that Midnight Club contains dozens of hilarious one-liners from all of the racers, the cops, and random civilians on the street. When you plow into a civilian and he flies up into the sky, and yells ~Somebody better call an ambulance,~ or you hear Emilio roast you after he passes, that little bit of humor keeps things balanced, strangely safe, and fun. Also, the menu system is packed with car sounds, from car alarms to ignitions, the sound files on this one are worthy.  Angel Studios is one of the hottest developers in the industry right now, and this highly refined variation of Midtown Madness is a beautiful and fast game, but most importantly, it's an extremely fun game. One month ago I had pretty much written it off, but the frame rates, the sense of speed, and the mission-based play came together quite dramatically, and the final product is one of the more original games on the PlayStation 2 at launch. In addition to the litany of cars, the huge cities are riddled with secrets and original ways to make shortcuts, which makes single player gameplay and two-player games extremely fun. Plus, it's one of the best looking games on the PS2, too.I think the game's only weaknesses are that it may be short. Rockstar and Angel originally planned to have three cities in the final version -- New York, London, and Tokyo -- but Tokyo was cut so the game would make the launch date. What does that mean? Midnight Club: Street Racing 2 better have Tokyo in it! Of the two Rockstar games at launch, Midnight Club and Smuggler's Run, Midnight Club gets my vote.", "date": "Oct 25, 2000"}
