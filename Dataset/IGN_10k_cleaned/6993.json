After several delays, developer Stainless Steel Studios went under with Rise & Fall not too far from completion. Publisher Midway picked up the code and shuffled it off to their San Diego studios to finish off. Unfortunately the game itself has felt the impact of the shuffle. While the ideas of combining historically based real-time strategy with heavy action elements aren't bad in theory, they're mediocre in practice. The strategy is full of basic problems, the action isn't fun, and the single player campaign is less than inspiring. If it wasn't for decent skirmish and multiplayer there would be very little redeeming in the experience.   The main thrust of the Rise & Fall experience is the blend between strategy and action. Much of the game plays as a traditional real-time strategy experience with the harvesting or resources, construction of bases, and research of technology but it's also possible to zoom down into the action by taking control of the hero to do some serious damage. The heroes all come from the ancient world from different moments in history. For instance, Greece has Alexander while Caesar is represented for the Romans. While they lived at different times, it's easy to step back and let developers take license for fun's sake. Too bad it wasn't fun.   Much ado was made about this action portion of the experience but it fell flat. Swimmy controls, lack of interestingly bad-ass combat moves, and bland visuals made for an all around boring experience where it should have been fast-paced and brutal. If there's going to be that much attention on a specific feature of your game, especially when it's not the usual fare for an RTS and probably took time away from the development of the strategy aspects, it had better be done well. But it wasn't. The novelty is short lived.   The sad thing is that the hero mode is actually pretty important to gameplay from a strategic perspective. While heroes are stronger than the average unit all of the time, they're much more powerful in the hands of the player. Attacks do a ton of damage and swinging wildly into the middle of a huge battle can change the tide immediately assuming there's not another hero doing the same thing on the other side. But the lack of personality, special combat moves, and the fun factor that most action games focus on really makes hero mode dull.   On the strategy tip the game didn't fare a whole lot better. The problem wasn't necessarily with the base mechanics, though the effort was very formulaic, but with the execution. Path-finding was poor and units would get stuck on objects in the world, units had terrible threat recognition and disregarded orders to attack specific enemies with regularity, rotation of buildings for placement was clunky, ladder mechanics for sieging walls were sloppy, AI has no idea what to do about double lines of walls, line of sight isn't implemented correctly, and naval units were way too hard to dock on shore. Then there are features like unit silhouettes that just weren't included. How are you supposed to have any clue what's happening behind buildings, especially in a crowded base, when there are no silhouettes?   Half the time, features that are there aren't much better. For instance, units are constructed as individuals but can be connected to a bigger formation. While it sounds neat in practice, it can be a hell of a time to wrestle with connecting formations together and keeping track of everything, especially since formations will break up automatically when boarding a ship or mounting a wall.   These same formations can be trained by special units on the Greek side in order to increase their effectiveness, which I found neat, if incredibly time consuming. But if these same individual units that were trained in the formations are split into two separate smaller formations, one of the two will lose all of the training. Likewise, any units sent to defend a wall will lose any formation or training bonuses while on the wall, which is particularly aggravating in the case of archers since being up on walls seems to offer little to no protection from archers on the ground.    One of the features that looked fairly tasty was naval combat and some aspects of it are nice. Not only can ships ram each other but sailors can toss lines across the water to pull an enemy boat close for boarding maneuvers in order to kill everyone and steal the ship. It's fun being a pirate. Unfortunately it's another case of execution not coming through. Ramming is a tricky proposition since a target ship has to be pretty much exactly perpendicular to be rammed. Miss by a degree or two and things could just not work at all leaving your ship sitting within firing or grappling distance of the intended target. Grappling can be just as tricky since ships have a way of not wanting to come together once grappled. I'd often try to grapple a ship and leave to take care of other things only to come back and see them simply gyrating together trying to make the connection.    All of these aspects of the game can be seen in the single player campaign, which is semi-gratifying at best. Some missions contain a decently challenging structure to appreciate while others demonstrate the weaknesses of the action mode entirely, such as the Greek arena mission (holy crap that was terrible) while others simply don't give any hints as to what's about to happen. For example, one mission in the Greek campaign asks players to construct walls for a couple of settlements. However, they don't say ~build an army up first because a gigantic force is going to attack you right after that last wall is built!~ Whereas I lost the first time through the mission because I had no clue what was about to happen, the second time through I was able to commit overkill including two sets of walls which the enemy had no clue how to overcome.   The story portions of the single player campaigns are forgettable enough as to wish that it had been left out altogether. The cutscenes are a jumble of dialogue unable to illicit any sense of attachment to what's happening. The cutscenes are also presented as pre-rendered engine movies compressed to questionable quality. Why they decided to go that route instead of in-engine is unclear.   There is a bit of light at the end of the tunnel. If you can handle all of the little details gone wrong, there's some fun to be had in the skirmish and multiplayer modes. The game offers pretty hectic play (after an almost unbearably slow beginning) which rewards players for getting out and taking control points along the way. It's not the easiest to find a game quite yet, but hopefully that will pick up if more people get out and grab the game.   Visuals in general were strikingly unimpressive. The models themselves aren't terrible but chunky animations (especially horses) make them look much worse. Environments can be nice but the base structures are blocky and blah, especially the ridiculous walls. Very few special effects are included while lighting and shadows are almost non-existent. With engines like those used in Earth 2160, Age of Empires III, Rise of Legends, and SpellForce 2 out there, Rise & Fall looks a couple of years behind the competition. What's even crazier is that these levels take a long damn time to load and performance isn't spectacular, even on a 3.2GHz machine with 2GB of RAM and a GeForce 6800.  Sadly, there's very little reason to recommend this title to fans of the strategy or action genres. While there are some decent features, there are too many mistakes thrown on top of an altogether bland design. It's just too bad that the hybrid meant the developers put half the quality for both of the genres. Unless you're specifically looking for a game where you can get down into the action and make a difference to the battle in a traditional RTS setting, look elsewhere for your entertainment.", "date": "Jun 14, 2006"}
