{"name": "Alien Trilogy", "name_review": "Alien Trilogy", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/22/alien-trilogy", "text": "The Alien movies have proven themselves much more popular than anyone could've guessed when Ridley Scott released the original Alien in the late 70's. Almost 20 years on, and we're still fighting those acid-bleeding, double-jawed perfect killing machines with as much fervor as ever, only now it's in the first person.  The game starts in the middle of a Weyland-Yutani corporation colony infested with aliens. Your job: get the colony up and running, eliminate infected colonists, and kill those aliens. The mechanics will be immediately familiar to anyone who's ever played a first-person shooter (really, who hasn't ?) but it's the attention to detail that makes the game. Face huggers scuttle and big aliens drop onto you from the darkness above, all within an interactive environment. The control is extremely intuitive and really gets you into the middle of the action. You'd swear you were right in the movie.  There are a few problems, most noticeably in the confusing level layout, but for the most part Alien Trilogy does an excellent job of turning a great movie series into a great game.", "date": "Nov 22, 1996"}
