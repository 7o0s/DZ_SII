Telegames' version of Yars' Revenge on the Game Boy is a remake of a classic, excellent Atari 2600 game, and that's it. No glitz, no glamour, just a portable conversion of what many gamers played back more than a decade and a half ago. Features Classic Atari action 250 levels Bonus level Password saves For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  Here's the game in a nutshell, without the hubbub of the confusing alien names -- layman's terms only. You control a bug in a playfield. On the right is your target, surrounded by a shield that can be hacked away by your fly's firepower. To destroy your target, you must eat a few particles of the shield (or touch your target), fly back to the left end of the screen and be awarded one powerful shot. Fire this weapon, hit your target and move onto the next level.  Problem number one: a homing ~sprite~ makes it impossible to remain still in one spot  if it touches you, you die. Problem number two: in the middle of the playfield is a ~neutral zone.~ You can't be killed by the homing sprite, but you can't fire your main weapon or the single shot, either. Problem number three: your target turns into a missile and fires at you after a set time.   If I just left the review like that, I'd be at fault. Yars' Revenge isn't entirely exactly like the Atari 2600 version  but it's damn close. Here are some of the differences: Playfield scrolling. Instead of seeing all the screen at once like the Atari 2600 version, the Game Boy conversion keeps the action closer, scrolling around to follow your bug. You'll definitely get used to it, but it makes the game harder and more challenging since you can't always see when the enemy is going to fire his missile. You have to listen to audio cues and keep your eye on the icon at the lower right that tells you what your target is doing. Personally, I would have liked to have the choice to zoom the screen out, even if it hindered the graphics. Hey, if the game's all about the gameplay, then a downgrade in graphics wouldn't have mattered much, would it? Bonus level. If you stumble onto the hidden secret (which, quite honestly, I couldn't tell you since I stumbled upon it accidentally twice), you'll be warped a bonus level. Here, you control your bug in a maniacally-paced side scroller, trying to maneuver him from the left to right between asteroids and get him to touch the Ghost of Yar for extra points. It's a very basic game, but it does shake up the action and monotony a bit. Intermissions. Okay, it isn't much, but between key levels you'll be greeted by a splash graphics  screen with ~words to play by.~ It's just more polish for the game. No biggie. Password continue. Did you get up to level 16 and die? Start from there next time by entering the four character password.  When all is said and done, the developer did an excellent job capturing the essence of the original game. It's still Yars' Revenge, whether you loved or hated the game back in the early '80s. I like the game a lot, but it turns into a pattern  once you figure out how to destroy your target, it's all about being able to pull it off as the game gets progressively harder and faster. That's the real payoff, not some huge, elaborate ending after a certain level. How far can you get? That's the challenge...", "date": "Sep 30, 1999"}
