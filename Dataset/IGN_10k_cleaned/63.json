As many gamers know, the Warriors titles always stick with the same basic button-mashing formula and bring little else to the table. That, unfortunately, seems to be the case here.   If you've never played any of these titles before, let me spend a moment on the basics. Xtreme Legends has you guide a character through simple environments set in feudal Japan, hacking away at hundreds of enemy soldiers. Each battle usually has a certain set of conditions for winning, and you move from stronghold to stronghold dispatching enemy officers and ensuring victory for you and your army. Combat typically revolves around the basic alteration of two different attacks, complimented by a special Musou technique that clears large numbers of foes.    But as far as Warriors games go, Xtreme Legends is a bit of an odd case. It's actually expansion content for the original Samurai Warriors 2, but delivers this content in a very convoluted way. For PS2 owners, you'll need a save file from the original game if you want to bring your character data and progress over. However, if you want to fully explore the content from both the original Samurai Warriors 2 and Xtreme Legends, you'll need both discs (which you are prompted to swap between if necessary).   The expansion content in question includes a handful of new characters (and their respective story modes), a few weapons and attacks, two new difficulty levels, a raised level cap and the addition of the Mercenary Mode. This Mercenary Mode uses the exact same battle mechanics you'll find throughout the rest of the game but is structured in a more episodic fashion, where you work your way up through missions and hire other soldiers, accomplish special tasks, etc. It's a fine addition but ultimately gives more of the same.   As is usually the case, Xtreme Legends works just fine if you're a fan of button-mashing. Although there is a very basic combo system integrated into the title, the grand majority of your time will be spent pounding away at one or two buttons, with the occasional trigger thrown in for good measure. Fans of the Warriors franchises will feel right at home and I imagine that this is the kind of content they enjoy, but I think everything here feels incredibly stale. The added content does very little to bolster the already repetitive formulas embedded within the original.   A new face. In Xtreme Legends' defense, I definitely enjoy the RPG elements contained within the combat. Having the added incentive of uncovering new weapons, hiring new guards and especially leveling up your character to ridiculous proportions always makes a game more enjoyable for me. But when the combat is so uninspired, it's difficult to develop a keen interest in the experience as a whole.   If you're really curious about getting your hands on more content for Samurai Warriors 2, I can assure you that it only adds more of the same stuff you already played. In fact -- as far as I can tell -- some of the new characters have stories pulled directly from the scenarios found in the original game. It all feels bland.   And of course, there's the pressing issue about the delivery method. You're paying around thirty bucks for this content. At least with the PS2 version you can play without the original disc, but if that's the case then you're getting a greatly reduced amount of content for a pretty hefty price. In light of these circumstances, I don't consider Xtreme Legends to be a particularly enthralling deal.Xtreme Legends is just more of the same, on top of an already repetitive and mostly overused concept. I can understand why some gamers still enjoy the various Warriors franchises (especially those RPG attributes) but Xtreme Legends doesn't offer that much for thirty dollars. If you're desperate to add on to your Samurai Warriors experience, go for it. Otherwise, pass on this one.", "date": "Mar 20, 2008"}
