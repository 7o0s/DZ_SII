Is Diablo II an incredible improvement over the original? Yes. In typical Blizzard fashion, the company's listened to Diablo's fans and critics and comes back with a game that should satisfy both camps.   At its heart, the game remains the randomly-generated dungeon crawler we all know and love. Stock up on supplies, and go around killing monsters for fun and profit. That's still the same, with two major changes. First, you now have a town stash, or a place to store gold and supplies. Which is good because the game no longer tracks leftover gold or items when you quit. Which prevents you from making supply caches in convenient areas. Second, when you die, you lose a certain percentage of your gold (depending on your level) and all your supplies get left on your moldering corpse. This means you may have to fight or sneak your way past hordes of Fallen or Bone Knights sans protection in order to regain your status quo. These two changes add a whole new level of decision making and challenge designed to make you plan strategically instead of wading in like a barbarian of yore.   Perhaps the biggest change for everybody who played through the first Diablo is that you've got massively detailed interior and exterior environments. Each of the four chapters has a separate city/camp, an exterior environment, and several distinct dungeons. And they're all wonderfully drawn and animated, too, using new parallax and lighting effects. My personal favorite area is the desert world of chapter 2, which has a fantastically rendered Middle Eastern town surrounded by deserts filled with ancient ruins and necromantic mummies. It's a far cry from the endless stone and ironwork that marked your journey to Hell last time.   Blizzard replaces the old class system with five snazzy new professions -- Amazon, Crusader, Barbarian, Necromancer, and Sorceress. Obviously, the more martial classes, like the Crusader and Barbarian, are the easy choices when it comes to beating the game, but each character is surprisingly well-balanced. The Amazon is like a more heavily-armed version of the Rogue, and the Sorceress has a couple great spells that prevent her early and pitiful death. However, if you're feeling adventurous, the Necromancer is the way to go. Not only can you summon armies of Harryhausen-esque skeletons, your later high-level spells are incredibly powerful. Each class has 30 unique skills which can be upgraded 20 levels, making character development a critical key to your survival. Choose wisely, grasshopper...   All of these new features polish Diablo II into a shiny example of the dungeon crawler, but it still suffers from the flaws inherent within this RPG subgenre. Sure, each chapter has quests, great NPC characters, and the best CG movies seen this side of Final Fantasy, but it's still safer and more advantageous to explore every dungeon until you've killed everything before moving on, quest or no quest. Sure, I may need to find the Horadric staff in the one True tomb, but that won't stop me from going through the other six fake ones to grab artifacts and gold. That, and the fact that the NPCs pretty much say the same thing no matter how many times you talk to them ,makes a player feel kind of lonely.   So if you've got the yen to kill, kill, kill with pretty graphics, Diablo II provides everything you need, including a good story. But if you're not a multiplayer kind of guy or want something more interactive, you might want to try Baldur's Gate instead.", "date": "Jun 7, 2002"}
