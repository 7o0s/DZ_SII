He lusts for the throne without end. You, humble dwarf, seek his downfall. You seek it alone, or with friend. The quest is a long one, the dangers are many; unrelenting the Adder's attacks. But you, humble dwarf, will find victory -- if with mastery you wield Golden Axe.    Many early Genesis games were ports from the arcade. And many arcade games of the time were side-scrolling brawlers: Double Dragon came from Taito, Capcom had Final Fight, and SEGA had both Altered Beast and Golden Axe. Axe set itself apart from the pack with a unique storyline and setting, some fresh gameplay ideas and a variety of selectable heroes.    The story finds the fantasy realm of Yuria overrun by the hordes of the Death Adder. The Adder has captured Yuria's rulers, and is threatening their execution if the population of peasants refuses to acknowledge him as their new, and only, king. The land is evocative of other fantasy worlds, like those seen in Willow or Conan the Barbarian. Expectedly, then, a barbarian is one possible character choice. Ax Battler is a human warrior, a man who ignores the obvious implications of his name and instead fights evil with a broadsword. Also sworded is Tyris Flare, a female fighter who commands fire magic. It's with the third and final hero, Gilius Thunderhead that the titular axe firsts appears. The stout dwarven soldier wields a glimmering blade of battle, ferociously felling foes like so many helpless trees, blinded as they are by the shining, shimmering... wait a second... That axe isn't golden.   Something was lost in the translation when Golden Axe came to the Genesis, because in this version Gilius' weapon is silver. In fact, much of the game world looks tarnished -- a lack of vibrancy and detail plagues its graphics when compared to its arcade source. The audio, too, is compromised. Some digitized voice clips feel forced here, and the sound quality seems poor overall. It's another case of the 16-bit era's curse of watered-down, incomplete ports.   And yet Axe's offenses aren't egregious. Most arcade-to-console ports of the time removed levels, but this edition of Golden Axe does the opposite -- adding more stages to play around with. Added, too, are a pair alternate play modes: Beginner Mode, for players seeking a lesser challenge than the main quest offers, and Duel Mode, a parade of exceedingly more difficult battles that expert fighters can face to hone their skills.   The fun of Golden Axe's core gameplay is suitably translated too. It's a simple side-scrolling brawler, but each of the three selectable characters offers something unique. Each character has their own magical power, for example, with screen-clearing super attacks fueled by collectible potion jars. And each character can find and mount a variety of rideable beasts throughout the adventure as well -- including fire-breathing dragons and the infamous Altered Beast cross-over creature, Chicken Leg.Golden Axe is a title of compromise. New features were added for the Genesis version, while the clarity of its graphics and sound took a hit. It's a fair enough balance. And while this port should be known ~Grey Axe~ instead of Golden, it may still be worth a session or two for nostalgic brawler fans.", "date": "Dec 14, 2006"}
