We know you remember Ridge Racer. It wasn't just the clean graphical presentation that set the game apart from the other racers of the time -- yeah, that was nice -- but it wasn't what made the game. The hyper-addictive control mechanics that had us sliding our rides sideways long before Takumi would even drive the Toyota Trueno truly set the game apart. Namco wisely released Ridge Racer on the Sony PlayStation two years after its arcade debut. The rest is, well, history.   The series has seen almost half-a-dozen arcade kits and six home versions (with one appearing on the N64). To say the game has had its streak of popularity would be an understatement. Like the original, Ridge Racer V, also debuted with the appearance of a new Sony console, the PlayStation 2.   Unfortunately, V wasn't as well-received as Namco (and Sony) would have hoped. Namco tells us that the Ridge team wanted to try something new, something out of the ordinary -- that it ~needed a break~. But maybe, just maybe Namco decided that sales dictated it was time to give Ridge Racer a break.   Regardless of the reason, the Ridge Racer team hasn't been working on a new drifting game for the last two years. Instead, the team best known for cool cars, fun tracks and techno music has ditched its racing roots and gone with something more akin to Sony's Gran Turismo.  While on paper the idea might work, it won't stop Ridge Racer lovers and Namco fans alike from screaming bloody murder and making comparisons between R: Racing Evolution and the beloved Ridge Racers of past. And these aren't likely to be favorable comparisons.    Gameplay  Ridge Racer fans expecting a true sequel to their arcade-fast, drift-heavy franchise are in for a surprise at the very least and possibly a disappointment. R: Racing Evolution aspires to be Gran Turismo, not Ridge Racer, and while it succeeds in some respects -- it does feature a fair amount of licensed cars and tracks, for instance -- it falls well short of Sony's spectacular driving series for all sorts of reasons that we're going to detail.   Gameplay is comprised of four modes, including Racing Life (Story Mode), Time Attack, Arcade, and Versus. Racing Life has us assuming the role of ambulance driver-gone racecar driver, Rena, through 14 chapters. What this all boils down to is a series of races separated by crisp, entertaining full-motion video cut-scenes that drive the entertaining, but all too brief story along. While we admire Namco's attempt to do something a little different, to inject a wee bit more depth and variety into what is otherwise just a racer, this doesn't change the fact that the driving elements are nowhere as dazzling or compelling as the cut-sequences.   The game's 14 tracks and vehicles are available in Life, Time Attack, Arcade in Versus mode. However, some vehicles can't be used on specific tracks. And some you wouldn't want to use on given race venues. Try the Pantera on one of the rally tracks, if you don't believe us.    Control is very functional, but it feels stiff, plain and simple. Even in first-person perspective it feels like there's just a little bit of tuning missing. A steering wheel does much to make the game feel better, but not everyone who playing Evolution will invest in a steering wheel controller. And in third-person perspective, the camera is attached to the car by what feels to be a broomstick making for some really static motion and behavior. As a result, you never get a true sense of high speed and motion. We popped in Gran Turismo 4 Prologue for comparison, and Sony's racer felt five or six times faster, plus it smoked Namco's offering on pure control mechanics.   Namco did find a way to develop a Tekken-like gameplay mechanic that we've never seen before in any other racing game and make it fun at the same time. A driver's name and an empty meter will appear above the corresponding car as you near it. Follow behind the opposing driver and the empty meter will fill up from blue, to yellow to red and flashing red. When the meter is flashing that driver has a higher chance of cracking under the ~pressure~ and making a mistake. This is especially useful in longer races when dogfights for first are extremely common. It's like killing three birds with one stone. You get racing points for tailing, but you also increase your speed because of drafting and it's super fun. There's also a certain amount of tangible strategy that comes into play because of this function and we have to admit that it's a welcomed addition.   Despite some niceties, R: Racing Evolution in the end feels like a poor man's Gran Turismo. It doesn't control as tightly, lacks in sheer numbers of cars and tracks, comes up short in overall car physics, runs with a considerably lessoned sense of speed, and doesn't look nearly as pretty. Believe it or not, it's still a decent racing game. But anybody who has played Sony's title will easily prefer it and Ridge Racer fans will wonder what the hell Namco did with the game they knew and loved.    Graphics  ~Primitive, first generation PS2.~ That's one of the comments we heard from a bystander. We wouldn't so far as to say primitive, but we can see the comparison to a first generation PS2 game as Evolution looks only marginally better than Ridge Racer V. The sticking point for R: Racing Evolution have been the shimmery, plain graphics, at least, with most who have seen or played our reviewable copy of the game.   One of the problems with developing a game on three different platforms is that the visuals are usually the product of the lowest common denominator. But we aren't blaming the PS2 and calling it a day. No, this is also the fault of the development team. Although R: RE is available for all three consoles this is Namco's first real racing game to appear on both GameCube and Xbox. We figure that the team developed the PS2 version as the lead sku and had a programmer or two for the Microsoft and Nintendo consoles. If this is the case, and it probably is, that would explain why both the Xbox and Cube versions look so much like the PS2 build plus some filtering. Indeed, as nice as the replay cams might be, they're also the perfect vehicles with which to see the massive sea of repeating textures.    Though environments are generally bland and uninspired and void of advanced lighting or texture effects, the cars themselves look much better. The models -- be it the Takata Dome NSX, the Calsonic or the Skyline GTR -- all look like their real-life counterparts complete with reflective surfaces and believable physics. Car fanatics will probably be satisfied. Menus screens are plain, but cool with the typical trendy look Namco is known for. Anyone who has flown the skies of Ace Combat 04 might recognize the style as it's been pulled almost directly from Namco's dogfighter.   Sound  The chatter in Ace Combat 04 is among the best we've heard and Namco must agree as Evolution features a similar interactive voiceover system. Do well during a race and your pit crew won't hesitate to let you know; drive poorly and they'll be even more willing to give you a piece of their mind. Rival drivers also join in, mocking you and inciting you throughout the race.  Get really close and pressure a driver to the limit and he'll sound audibly agitated and stressed out. It all sounds solid.   Voice acting within the limited rendered cinematics benefits from having the same believable set of dialogue actors. They're neither too dramatic nor too ordinary. We wish we felt the same way about the engine and vehicle sounds, though. For some reason all the vehicles sound like they're superbikes pulled from MotoGP. And they quite possibly could be as some of the R: Racing Evolution team are transplants from Namco's superbike racer.  At least the music isn't half bad and some of the tunes are actually pretty freakin' cool, like T-Minus Ten. Like other Namco racers, you can choose which audio track you want as background music or you can go straight up engine sounds. On the downside, not all of the tracks are great. Some seem subdued or too rocky and don't appropriately fit the action.Call me a crazy bastard, but I'd buy R: Racing Evolution. Take into consideration that I'll get almost any racing game that has real cars, decent physics and a good amount of tracks. R: Racing Evolution does have all those, but it's not going to light your world on fire like a Gran Turismo 4, Project Gotham Racing 2 or even the ricey-but-fun Need for Speed Underground.Also take into consideration that I'm a huge Namco fan having imported everything from Mr. Driller to entire Ridge Racer series. I'm hard-pressed to recommend R: Racing Evolution to anyone other than the hardcore racing fan or the GameCube owner dying for a GT-Lite.Honestly, R: Racing Evolution is a good thing, just how good depends on what you like. Not matter what you think or how badly you want it to be, R: Racing Evolution is not a Ridge Racer. The game doesn't feel like Ridge Racer, it doesn't play like it -- hell, it doesn't even look like Namco's drift game. We're not totally retarded, but for the life of us, we couldn't disassociate R: Racing Evolution from Ridge Racer.We're sure Namco will soon find that most players can't break away from the game they've been playing for over a decade. Sadly, in our time behind the wheel of R: RE, the physics model didn't feel like it was up to snuff to try some impromptu drifting. For race-starved Cube owners this is perfect. NFSU fills the arcade void while R: RE gives us our version of Gran Turismo. The bad part is that it looks like a PS2 game. Xbox and PS2 owners will find that PGR2 and GT4 are sufficient on each of their respective consoles.", "date": "Dec 11, 2003"}
