And it's not the bats, or the ghosts, or even running out of breathable air. No, down there in the deepest caves your own worst enemy is yourself  and your horrible fear of heights.   Spelunker is a classic platforming game first developed for Atari computers in the early '80s, and was later ported to arcades, the Commodore 64 and the NES. This Virtual Console edition emulates the NES version, but, unfortunately, the NES version was one of the worst of the lot  because of the ~fear of heights~ issue. Your hero here can't withstand even the slightest of vertical falls. If you step off a ledge, fall into a hole, or even try to just step off of a ladder, you'll die. Instantly.    It's a gameplay issue that plagues the experience horribly, and while it's not a completely unique complaint against the oldest side-scrolling platformers  Mario would die in the same way in the first Donkey Kong  it's still crippling to the fun factor here. Spelunker demands absolute precision in its control to avoid these unnecessary deaths, and spending the effort to develop absolute precision is likely something you won't want to waste your time with.   This 10-second mine cart sequence is about as exhilirating as Spelunker gets.  But if you do, and if you continue to play, you'll find the core of Spelunker's platforming experience takes place in one large interconnected cave. Filled with elevators, mine carts, pitfalls and moving platforms, the Spelunker cave is fairly expansive considering the age of the original game design. Your hero is on the hunt for a hidden treasure, and getting to it means finding multi-colored keys to be able to unlock the doors blocking off access to the cave's lowest levels.   The key collectibles are joined by a host of other acquirable items, including bombs used to blast away piles of rubble, flares that can be used to take out screeching bats, and refills for your constantly-depleting tank of fresh air. The air meter functions like Spelunker's countdown timer  if you don't collect refills often enough, your hero will die of asphyxiation.   The only other element that occasionally mixes things up in Spelunker is the random spontaneous arrival of a ghost, which notably alters the game's single looping piece of background music into a spookier song for a short period of time. The ghost can be scared away with blasts of air from your reserve tank, meaning less time you'll then have to find and collect the next refill canister  but it's never too much of a concern. The overall game experience is so short that you'll rarely have to worry about the air meter, anyway. Gamers who've played through Spelunker once or twice before can complete the entire adventure, start to finish, in under ten minutes. This is not a long game.And it won't hold your interest long, either, making Spelunker a download that isn't really worth its asking price of 500 Wii Points at all. As a classic platformer from the early '80s, Spelunker certainly has some nostalgic value and will surely appeal to those gamers who played one of its original forms from 25 years ago. But newcomers to the experience would simply be frustrated by the control, which is nonsensically strict. It'll only take a handful of deaths coming about as a result of a five-pixel-tall vertical fall before you hit the Home Button to quit playing, and that earns Spelunker the dubious honor of joining Urban Champion, The Legend of Kage and Operation Wolf as one of the least desirable NES downloads on sale in the Wii Shop.", "date": "Mar 24, 2008"}
