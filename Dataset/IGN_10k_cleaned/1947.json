If I brush aside all of the cynicism I've accumulated over the years, and ifI look at Idol Minds' Cool Boarders 2001 with as open mind as possible, and if I forget what I know about the five previous Cool Boarders, and if I pretend I have never seen or played 1080 or SSX, I might conclude that it's a great snowboarding game. That's a lot of ~ifs,~ though.   So, I'll skip them, and get to it. Cool Boarders 2001, while not terribly original or stunning, is a solid snowboarding game that delivers a good sense of speed, better than average graphics, and an accessible set of levels and controls. In short, it's the best Cool Boarders game of five that I have ever played, and though I feel dirty saying that, it's true. While that might be an accolade for some, it's the fifth of the series, and it's by no means the best snowboarding game I have ever played. It's still not as good as EA's SSX or Nintendo's 1080 Snowboarding, but it's a solid overall game that's fun, and no casual gamer should regret buying it.   Gameplay  Cool Boarders works in the traditional fashion of extreme sports. Players can get down to a Quick Run, just to get the feel of the game, challenge another player in Two-Player Quick Run, or they can start their own Career. Career is clearly where it's at. Players can pick their favorite pro boarder, select a licensed board, and name themselves, before sliding down the hill. It's kind of a short list, but it's just the tip of the iceberg, really.   When it comes to snowboarding, the major issues that make or break them are control, level design, looks, and speed. Originality and innovation are of course both important, but they are rare, and there isn't much of that here, so I'll just skip it. Cool Boarders 2001 comprises a good dosage of all these qualities.   The characters are all motion-captured and the work was exercised with subtlety and finesse for the most part. The characters move well, and look realistic, for the most part, as they pull of their moves, crash, and fly through the air. In some cases, you can watch players occasionally catch themselves from falling over, and react to a big jump, the realism shines through. And for the most part, the motion-capture doesn't work against the control. In many games the motion capture work is excellent, but it hampers quick movements and instant responsiveness because the motion capture move has to complete its motion before reacting to your input. Here, it's almost never the case. The animation, basic as it is, came out great. The characters are fluid and smooth moving, and while there are some sketchy parts to it, the animation is convincing enough to make us smile.    What helps the animation and all of the wonderful smoothness of the game work is aided much by framerate, and Cool Boarders 2001 has it. This game is fast, my friends. It appears to be moving at about 60 fps, with no noticeable slowdown. That means when you burst through a section of trees and slide down a massive steep hillside, you feel the speed of it all. In the same general line of smart crucial gameplay elements, players experience slick, rocky, and powdery surfaces with more feeling now more than ever in the series. The best sense of snow is in the powder. The riders slow down and along with some excellent audio accompaniments, and the feeling of powdery, dry snow pushing aside from your snowboard is quite realistic.    True to its tradition, Cool Boarders is still rooted in arcade-style gameplay. For the most part, the gameplay is forgiving and flexible. The simple controls didn't bother me much at all, while a few people in our office didn't like them. X is jump and combined with the directional button, players can pull off several kinds of grabs from Stalefish, Lien Air, Mutes, Indys, and Backsides, among others. When in mid-air Circle enables Shifties and flips, while the Square button tweaks out any of the grabs. R2 enables spins, and Triangle enacts a rail slide. The moves are easy to learn, and a handy training course sets up gamers after they pass through the first two courses in Career.   Two things tainted my experience with the controls, however, and one of them might just by might own fault, but I expect that others may discover the same problem. First, when I pull off moves with my right thumb, I often touched the right analog button, or R4, and by doing so, I accidentally reset my rider. This was absolutely frustrating, especially as I lined up my rider for a sequence. Yucch.   The second aspect of the controls that chided my experience was the pre-set specials. The lame notion that any gamer would ever grow to like these specials is beyond me. In Cool Boarders 2001, players can pull off any moves they like manually, but if they want to earn some major points, they can pull off a Special Move. There are at least 10 of these; the first four of them are instantly available, while the other six are earned. The problem is in the way they are pulled off. While pressing X down to prepare for a jump, one must tap in the sequence of the Special Move (i.e. L1, R1, L1). I mean to tell you that the moves are pressed in before you even lift off the ground, so that when you're in mid-air, the move is pulled off automatically.   This control scheme reminds me all too much of a game I never liked, Killer Instinct, and it goes against the grain of all of the other aspects of the control scheme in Cool Boarders, which is generally based on skill. They shouldn't have done it.    The level design in Cool Boarders 2001 is better than it's ever been. It's still not stunning, or original, but it's better than it's been. The steep channels of snow and rock, the flat, pixelly trees and the narrow, obvious courses have transformed, for the most part. Taking a lot of nods from EA's SSX, Cool Boarders 2001 is mostly designed to ride as an open set of invisible, crossing, weaving paths that enable many different choices to be made. Progressing through the Career mode opens up some creative if not altogether obviously Xeroxed levels from SSX, and some of the trick-based courses are filled with opportunities to pull off serious tricks. In short, even if they aren't entirely original, they are somewhat fun.   Lastly, the best and most challenging thing about Cool Boarders 2001 is way in which you progress through the courses, and the Sequences. Players are given goals in each of the courses, usually a point goal and a sequence goal. The point goal is about reaching a number by pulling off different, big tricks. Sequences are mostly secret lines that players need to find and follow, and they're oftentimes fun, almost always challenging. I didn't like them at first, but the more and more I played, the better I liked them. They provide an excellent set of replay goals that may keep gamers going for some time. In short, the more goals you reach the more levels, tricks, and riders you open. It's a nice reward system that works well.    Graphics  Cool Boarders 2001 is not ugly. In fact, it's even almost pretty. The open courses are peppered with polygonal trees and giant shoulders of rocks, ledges, and housing structures. The whole slope is shown when players start their runs, and in fact, the whole valley is shown. A huge valley is nicely detailed and displayed in each run.   As I mentioned before, the riders are well motion captured and their animation and responsiveness are solid. Apparently, the riders' faces were even digitally captured, although you won't see their faces much while riding.   The game rarely drops in framerate, and there appears to be no pop-up, fade-in, or graphical glitches of any kind that distract or deter from the overall visual picture. In short, while the textures on the riders are the highlight of the kind of intricate detail to be found in Cool Boarders 2001, the mostly repetitive and average-looking textures from the rest of the game are good enough to keep us from complaining.   Sound  I have two opposing opinions about the sound. The sound of the snow is wonderfully real, and it's also totally engrossing. I have been sitting here for the past few days with Cool Boarders 2001 on at my desk, and while the rest of the world zooms by I listen to the brisk, clean sound of snow sifting across snowboards. And it's just cool. The sound of the thin snow, the rocky snow, and the powder is altogether  great. Sound plays a bigger part in realism than most people give credit for, and the snow is nice.   On the other hand, the riders themselves just sound stupid. They say stupid things, like ~Ow! My feet hurt!~ or ~You got beat by a girl,~ or ~See you at the bottom!~ and it's all just such bland, obvious, un-engaging talk that it could have been totally eliminated and nobody would have complained. If you're going to make the characters say something, have them say something original, funny, or cruel. This banter is just weak.   The music is good. It's hard, it rocks, it's mostly current, and it pumps the adrenaline. Sorted.In the end, Cool Boarders 2001 was much better than I ever expected it to be. The game never ditches its roots entirely for SSX, but it borrows just enough from it, and stays consistent with just enough of the basics -- framerate, looks, control, etc. -- to push the series a little step forward. I still prefer SSX to this by a long shot, but Cool Boarders 2001 holds it own. Cool Boarders may never achieve greatness, but in this version it has at least achieved goodness. I would not be embarrassed to own this game, because the principles of the design are solid, and the end result is that the game is fun through and through. So, if you just love snowboarding games and you have to buy them all, go right ahead and get this, you won't regret it.", "date": "May 31, 2001"}
