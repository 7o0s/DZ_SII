Case in point, Lexis from Shadowsoft. This puzzle/word game hybrid was recently picked up for publishing and distribution by Carl Forhan and his company Songbird Productions (read the Ponx review for information on his original Lynx title). The game is a little too complex for its own good, but it's definitely something to play if you're looking for new blood for your classic handheld. Features 99 levels of increasing difficulty More than 20,000 words in the game's library Available for purchase at https://songbird.atari.org For the Atari Lynx  Lexis is an idea that crosses Tetris with Scrabble.  Letters of the alphabet slowly drop into a bin, and you use the D-Pad to maneuver them into place. The idea is to form three or more letter words to make them disappear. The words can be spelled forwards or backwards, up or down. When they disappear, the letters on top fall into place, and occasionally they'll spell more words and disappear...creating a chain reaction. Levels have certain quotas to meet  in one level, you'll have to form five three-letter words to move on, others spell five words vertically. In others, you just have to place 25 letters into the bin before moving on. The bin of letters left over gets carried over to the next level  and if the pile gets too high, it's game over.  The problem with this game  way too much thinking is necessary to play Lexis. Instead of forming simple lines like in Tetris, you have to form complex words. You have to place letters at the bottom of the bin in hopes that you'll randomly get the letter you need to form certain words. With 26 possibilites, the chance of you getting an ~E~ after an ~X~ is pretty slim. Also, some tasks require you to form four letter words to advance...and sometimes that's just an annoying task to do. You have no idea how many times I've tried to create the words like ~PLAY~ but have ~PLA~ disappear because it spells ~ALP~ backwards. Your mind has to work overtime, and to be honest my head hurt after playing a half-hour session.  Also, while the game has a professional polish, it could have looked a little better. The letters use the generic Lynx font  it would have been nice if they made them look like Scrabble pieces. That would have given the game a bit more class, at least in my opinion. I have to be blunt -- I just did not have any real fun playing Lexis. I can appreciate the design, but when you have to start looking at your pile and reading the possible words frontways and backways, and trying to anticipate other letters showing up in the future...sorry. After playing 10 levels straight of this game I realized I was only playing it as a job. I wouldn't play this game for amusement. Still, it's a good additionif you're a collector -- Lexis is a professionally polished game, and better than some of the shareware stinkers out there.", "date": "Oct 14, 1999"}
