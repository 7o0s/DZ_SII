Ring King was one of the best boxing arcade titles in existence (right behindSuper Punch-Out, of course), and it would be great to revisit such an intense, humorous game on the handheld. Unfortunately, the only thing these guys snagged from Ring King for Knockout Kings is the perspective -- this game is way too mindless and sloppily designed to be compared to that classic arcade game.  Features 10 real-life boxers Create a boxer Slugfest and Tournament modes Link Cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Color Knockout Kings on the Game Boy Color is loosely based on the PlayStation series of the same name -- the game features ten of the greatest boxers in history (Muhammad Ali, Oscar De La Hoya, Sugar Ray Leonard, Joe Frazier, Shane Mosley, Michael Grant, Lennox Lewis, Floyd Mayweather, and Rocky Marciano) duking it out in a multi-round venue where you try and get the other guy to kiss the canvas.  You can either go up against each individual fighters in a tournament ladder, go up against one in a brutal slugfest, or take on a friend via the link cable. The game even features a create-a-fighter option where you can build a alter-ego from scratch and train him to go up against the big guys.  The problem with Knockout Kings is that it wants to be both a simulation as well as an exaggerated arcade game, and it doesn't really come through as either one -- it should have been one or the other. The game looks like it could be a lot of fun, and it certainly doesn't look like a simulation, but the designers should have expanded on the arcade feel. They should have gone nuts all the way like Ring King did -- one solid uppercut sent the opponent flying out of the ring, or a roundhouse sent him spinning like a top. There's nothing like that here -- it's a half attempt at arcade-style boxing. The development team attempted to get a little real by setting height, weight, and reach attributes to each of the boxers, but damned if you'll be able to tell when you get into the ring -- graphically, all the fighters look the same (other than the oversized head on their shoulders). The designers do get a little silly in portions of the game (changing the ring girl at the beginning of every round, for example...complete with whistles from the spectators), but what the game really needed was a shot in the over-the-top department.  What's worse is the characters' bodies are so squashed and small that you can't see any of the punches land on you or your opponent.  Exaggerating the motions of the boxers would have done wonders in this department. The clumsy control scheme (press a direction and a button for different style punches) makes it EXTREMELY difficult to plan out any kind of strategy, since you're constantly moving in a 360-degree ring and facing your opponent in eight possible directions.  The Digital Eclipse style is definitely here -- the game has clean graphics, a decent interface, and a really sharp audio engine (the digitized audio keeps getting better with every generation). You just can't recommend a game that looks and sounds good, but plays sloppy.  Boxing fans are going to have to wait a while longer before they get a somewhat decent Game Boy Color fighter to call their own -- both Ready 2 Rumble and Knockout Kings have the substance, but lack the flair...and I was so looking forward to a revisit to my second favorite boxing game in the arcade (Ring King). Well, there's always a Game Boy Color exclusive version of Super Punch Out. How about it, Nintendo?", "date": "Jan 8, 2000"}
