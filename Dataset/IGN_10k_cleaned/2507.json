You see, franchises are a tricky thing. If you insist on calling your game NFL, WWF, or Star Trek, you have to, at the absolute minimum, incorporate those distinct features that individualize and distinguish those franchises from others of the ilk. Anything less is intolerable. And what if a company didn't do that? What if Madden 2003 came out and only featured half of the NFL teams, none of the real players, and only the option to play the Super Bowl? Indeed, what if a title comes along and completely avoids its license, its heritage, its foundation? What then?    Back in my day, the Winter Olympics consisted of around 15 sports, with each sport having anywhere between two and ten events. Yup, back in my day things were sweet, Britney Spears was a famous movie star, aliens hadn't yet conquered Nebraska, and you could always count on Tal to eat non-chewable aspirin and birth control pills, mistaking them for Altoids. Wait just a darn second here... It is my day! So why the hell does Salt Lake 2002 only have six events? Perhaps it's just another of life's great mysteries. Life is mysterious after all. But thankfully Salt Lake 2002 is not. It's really more because the game is flamboyantly sucky than mysterious.  Figure Skating, Luge, Biathlon, Skeleton, Nordic Combine, Speed Skating, Curling, Short Track, and all of the variations therein are completely absent and unaccounted for. What Salt Lake 2002 does pathetically scrounge up in their place is an entirely unacceptable selection of six specific events.  The brightest of the six feeble stars would have to be Men's Alpine Skiing Downhill. In it, two buttons are used to move left and right and another to crouch for speed. A proper start off is critical to success, as is finding a quick line down the slope and managing the crouch with often close turns. Like the rest of the events, this one still ultimately offers far too little the way of variation once acclimated to. What it does manage to do is craft and deliver an often times exhilarating and assumedly accurate sense of speed, only present in the surprisingly workable first-person perspective. What it doesn't do is last. As mentioned, after only a few quick plays, enough will become enough.    Ladies Alpine Skiing Slalom, and Men's Snowboard Parallel Giant Slalom are both nearly identical to the first, in that they both require moving left and right between things, but neither feels as polished as the Men's Alpine Skiing Downhill before it.  Snowboarding is twitchy and far too loose and slow for comfort. While, on the other hand, the girly slalom (I can say that because it's true) is very erratic, and difficult to master, often jarring play to painful restarts, which are in and of themselves plagued by endless popup windows intended to show current standings, but merely aggravating with their slowness and inherent delays.  That's three down. Men's Two-Man Bobsleigh is perhaps the best of the remainder, speedy and demanding as it is. There's little in the way of control, but minor taps to alter direction following the feverish button stamp at the onset are all that's required to expedite your trek down the course. Again, with the tiresome pitch: the second time you finish this in first place standing is the last time you'll play it.  Next come the two aerial events: Women's Freestyle Skiing Aerials, and Men's Ski Jumping K120 Individuals. The women's bit only requires that you press buttons when prompted. In honesty, it's actually kind of enjoyable. Instructions speedily traverse the screen (dependent on what level of trick you're attempting) and you punch in what appears to pull off your maneuver, Left + A, Down + B, etc. The sad part is that you'll be too busy reading to enjoy the outcome. The men's ski jump also greatly emphasizes timing. Start in good wind position, lift off, position the skis by repeatedly tapping directions, and then press a button to land. It's just as boring as it reads. I was scoring gold medals on both airborne events the third time I played them.  What's left to extend the play then? Absolutely freaking nothing. That's it. I just described the entire damn crappy game to you. You can do the same crap in crappy hot seat multiplayer or crappy splitscreen for the crappy snowboarding event (whee, crappy token features), but that's really the crappy gist of it. There is no more. There is nothing else. Attempts are made at extending longevity by mixing up these same events into different modes and at different times of the day, but they're still the same -- there's no changing that. They always play exactly the same (broken and uninspired), they always feel exactly the same, and there are far too few of them to hold interest. If you like to do boring things over and over and over and over again, then boy will you ever hate Salt Lake 2002 (it still sucks enough to not be good even for wintry masochists).  I don't expect a perfect melding of SSX, Tony Hawk, and whatever else. Nor do I expect the inclusion of a full fledged NHL game. But what I do expect, and demand, is some discernable, appreciable degree of effort placed into the actual game and into maintaining and delivering the Olympic license to the fullest possible extent. Something, anything. At least throw in one ice skating event or one bleeding Curling match. Truly, would there ever be a Summer Olympics without any water sports? Of course not.       But this, this treacherous, devious game that will no doubt prey on the uninformed...this, this monstrosity, does none of that. None of it! It doesn't even have all the countries or any of the actual athletes. Wow, I get to play as one of 16 nations... Of course Croatia will be part of that fine selection, the prominent superpower that it is. No? Ah, who cares? Austria is close enough. Not like I had any shred of pride or patriotism anyway. How hard is it to add more flags and colors? This game cannot even call itself the Olympics.  Authenticity doesn't necessarily prelude to their being half-hour looks into the meaningless but ~inspiring~ lives of our athletes. Like every other sane person on the face of the planet, I couldn't care less about how Apollo's father beat him and locked him in a cabin when he was a small boy, forcing him to be the triumphant speed skater he knew he could be. Nor do I care how some ass always wanted to be a bobsledder since he was a youth. How, while other kids with aspirations of doctoring and lawyering were dating and playing, he'd be held up in his room focusing intently on developing the mental discipline required to jump in the back of a speedy sled and hold onto another man's crotch for dear life. No, none of that matters. What would have been nice, however, is the inclusion of a few real names and faces. But no, I suppose expecting a game sporting the official Olympic license to actually have a few real athletes is far too much to hope for. Stupid me. Really, how much work would it have taken to get the names of broke Russians who toil in coal mines during the day and aerial jump at night? But hey, at least all the technically sound character models look freakish, so they got that going for them. Huh, huh?     Goody, now I get to talk about the audio. I heard stuff. That is all. Actually, some of the effects are pretty good (the huffing and puffing in Men's Alpine Skiing Downhill first-person mode), but the rest of it is pretty badly sad. There's this terrible, omnipresent horrific car honking that drowns out everything else. I don't know that it's something that actually exists in Olympic sport, but I can't see how constantly hearing, WAAAAAAAAAAAAA, WAA, WAA, WAAAA... WAAAAAAAAAA could be beneficial to an athlete's performance. In fairness, it does get mixed up some. There will come times when a player might hear WaaaaaaaAAAAAAAA and then WwwwwwwwAAAAAAAAAA. Good stuff.  Believe it or not there's actually commentary behind all this wailing; terrible, absolutely useless commentary. I could have easily done better play-by-play. Hell, Dan could have done better play-by-play and he's borderline incoherent:   ~Shut up. I hate you. Shut up. I hate you. [explicative] [explicative] Shut up... Purty.~  Dan's casual church conversations might have actually lent some zest to this dull ass game. But, hearing the commentator go, ~He's going to need to speed up to win~ once an event is just as good. Without him I would have been totally lost. How would have I know that going fast is the key to success? Drat, and all this time I was playing it slow, hoping the swelling pity of the judges would be enough to earn me my gold.  A saving grace, a silver lining! Can it be? Yup, the graphics are actually good. Draw distance is far enough off. The events are populated and lined with all kinds of spectators, buildings and such, and the character models themselves are glossy and nicely detailed, albeit artistically freakish. Animation can be a bit stiff, and particle effects go largely undeveloped, but watching a good player make his way all the way down a run without so much as a hitch is eye-catching until the game crashes your computer.  Salt Lake 2002 is one of those dreaded products in our industry that necessitates a bit of prayer every single time you turn it on. You know the one...   ~Oh God, please don't let this stupid thing crash. Please don't crash. Please?~  Then you realize the game not crashing means you actually have to play some more. Suddenly your crucifix comes down, your voodoo doll up, and prayer changes to chanting.   ~Oh Shambala, king of ghastly ghouls, please vanquish this CDROM to your dark lair with beams of green fire. Shambala, heed my dark call!~   In comes the menacing fog.  I liken this game's production value to that movie Cube. Yeah, it's this terrible place that traps and tortures people, but it's also this headless entity that somewhere along the way lost all meaning, purpose and direction. You have a whole bunch of people working on it, with each person keeping his or her eye squarely on the comparatively miniscule task in front of them, never seeing how the whole thing is going to come together. Pretty soon there's this crazy ass thing that barely works, has no real meaning, and no one even knows what the hell it's all about or why it came to be.  Salt Lake 2002 is an aggravating, poor, highly unenjoyable game that barely qualifies as rubbish. This stupid, stupid title's sheer lack of everything is plain baffling. The only authenticity and ties to the Olympics it has are the confounding scoring systems and cold white stuff that usually rests under your feet, or on the tops of trees and buildings. Don't buy this game. Don't even pick it up when you go to the store (unless you're throwing it at a burglar or something). In fact, don't even do that, I fear you may irreparably soil your hand or somehow become infected as I have. If you're driving down the freeway and it lands on your windshield (which implies you're driving directly behind me, by the way), whatever you do, don't stop. Just hit the wipers and hope the soapy goodness can wash away the unclean.  It's times like these that I'm reminded of Steve's immensely profound and inspiring speech just after I finished playing Salt Lake 2002... ~Oh, sweet God! Someone threw some kind of Olympic CD in my eye!~ Words of wisdom, Stephen. Words...of...wisdom. Get back to basics, I say. Salt Lake 2002 is proof positive that it's once again time for the Olympiad to stand for a bunch of crazy naked Greeks throwing crap.", "date": "Feb 26, 2002"}
