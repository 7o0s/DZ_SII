The tale of the Baudelaire children is not for optimists, dreamers, or those who like everything wrapped up in a nice little bow. Instead, the three orphaned stars of Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events find heartache, death, and madness wherever they turn. Each good moment is met with three bad, every well-meaning friend defeated by a sinister villain. This is the tale of the most unfortunate orphans to ever grace a children's novel. For a few hours, you can partake in their misery as Violet (the inventor), Klaus (the bookworm), and Sunny (the baby) attempt to outwit and outlast their demonic uncle, Count Olaf.  Things begin poorly for the Baudelaire trio, as their parents die of mysterious circumstances and they wind up in the custody of their greedy, cold-hearted, murderous Uncle. A two-bit actor with aspirations of wealth and power, Count Olaf has no stomach for children and sees only the big payday should his new charges meet an untimely end.  Faithfully retelling the first three novels in the popular, morose children's novels of the same name, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is not a title your typical gamer will enjoy. This is, without shame, a game for children and as such, you shouldn't expect the intensity or complexity seen in many of today's games. Keep in mind that this game is not intended for a 25-year-old hardcore gamer, this, like Trix, is for kids. As such, Unfortunate Events does a great job of maintaining the spirit of the books and the game (based on both the books and the upcoming movie starring Jim Carrey) manages to be the one bright spot in the otherwise bleak world of Lemony Snicket.   You take the role of the three Baudelaire children, able to switch between Klaus and Violet at any time with the touch of a button. Sunny is reserved for special situations, where someone of her stature is required to climb into a tiny hole to complete a mission. Each child has their own special gifts that come into play throughout Unfortunate Events.  Violet is most prominent, as she must come up with numerous inventions throughout the short, four-hour adventure. Her inventions require several items, which can be found throughout the environment. A nice touch is that you can actually come across many of these things earlier on, so if you have a good memory, you can remember where you first saw them. Once assembled, these inventions are used as weapons or as means of transportation. Through the course of the game, Violent pieces together a pair of stilts, a peppermint launcher, and more than a half-dozen other contraptions. There are also a few mouse trap-type inventions, which, once fully constructed, are shown in elaborate in-game cinematics reminiscent of old Tom & Jerry cartoons. This sort of imaginative effort helps to separate Unfortunate Events for the standard movie-to-game dreck.    Klaus, who is a bookworm in the novels, is more muscle here. He's the main choice for beating the crap out of rats in the kitchen or taking on one of the game's numerous bosses -- all of whom serve as henchmen for Count Olaf. If any character seems less than their true book self, it's Klaus. He's rarely given a chance to shine with his brain, but that's just a small misstep in an otherwise solid translation.  Sunny is, surprisingly, the best character to play. Her adventures are 3D side-scrollers that focus on platforming. Timing jumps, avoiding blasts of steam from pipes, and butt-stomping lizards are all part of her duty. There are also a few water-slide mini-games, where Sunny must hop over obstacles as she body-surfs down a steep incline. I wish these were done from a behind-the-back perspective, though, so you could move Sunny left and right and add a bit more complexity to her trials.  Though the overall design is smart, there are some flaws. Fighting rats, crabs, and other crawlies is often a nuisance. It's not always easy to direct characters or aim properly and there are more than a few moments where you just can't seem to avoid being hit. The earlier stages don't offer the same gameplay variations seen in the last third of Unfortunate Events, which adds arcade shooting elements.  The one aspect missing from gameplay is anything that really challenges mentally. There are plenty of fetch quests, but no puzzles. A few moments where kid's are forced to use their brain to come up with a solution -- instead of being handed to them through dialogue -- would have been a wise addition.  The majority of story is told through sketch-book cut-scenes. These long narratives (voiced by Tim Curry) are often funny and interesting, but they also weaken the overall game. There are very few instances where you get to see Count Olaf fully-rendered. Instead, he is often seen in a still sketch with mediocre voice-acting provided by Jim Carrey (no idea why it sound so, well, blah). You never get to witness Count Olaf in disguise as Stephano or Captain Sham, which is a shame. While the style of the sketch cut-scenes is clever, it's used too often and takes too much from the story.Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is a faithful rendition of the books and should please young fans. The gameplay at times feels a bit too dumbed down, but is overall an excellent example of what can be done with a game designed specifically for children. Older fans of the books may just want to rent this one, as it's an easy game for adults, lasting only 4-5 hours. Kids, however, may find a bit more challenge in some elements. If a few more puzzles were added to actually challenge young minds, this would be a real winner. As is, Unfortunate Events is a good, but not great game that does more right than wrong.", "date": "Nov 15, 2004"}
