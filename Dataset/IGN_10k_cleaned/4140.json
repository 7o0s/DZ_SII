But sports? Apart from the stray few titles of varying quality, sports titles haven't exactly been as plentiful on the handheld system. More specifically, GBA hockey fans haven't had much to cheer about. Electronic Arts made one shot with its NHL series two years ago, but other than the initial release the company hasn't touched that franchise for the GBA since. Backyard Hockey from Atari definitely isn't going to fill the void since it honestly isn't made to be realistic. But it is surprisingly deep and well produced for a game that looks like it's aimed at the younger crowd. It's almost as if the developers strived to create a true hockey experience, but were tied down by the limits of the Backyard Sports branding. Ultimately, it's only an above average hockey experience on the GBA. Features All 30 NHL teams Ten different professionals Ice hockey and air hockey Cartridge save Link cable support  The Backyard Sports series is clearly aimed at the kids crowd with its cartoony look and exaggerated action. But at the same time, with the inclusion of the NHL license and professional players, it also looks like the game's trying to appeal to hockey fans of all ages. The stats tracking, the create-a-player, the season mode all add up to a rich hockey experience...but only if the actual hockey game had the same focus. Unfortunately, in this respect the gameplay didn't get nearly as much.  Don't get me wrong, Backyard Hockey is, honestly, fully playable in its 3-on-3 design. The developers obviously patterned its game design after other successful hockey titles...EA Sports' own NHL series was clearly an inspiration. But its action has definitely been toned down for the younger crowd; the game's skating control, for example, is extremely tight, almost as if you're not even moving on ice. Checking is very lax and it's tough to lay on a hit that will be powerful enough to knock the puck free. Shooting and scoring is pretty tight, though, but while many successful goals depend on goalie location, just as many are about dumb luck...the goalie will sometimes just let some of them through with no rhyme or reason. But then, this is an element that's been a part of hockey since the start. The one control oddity is its ~turbo~ button that is more of a very short ~oomph~ where the player gets an extremely brief burst of speed. This would be good for checks, but it's not used for checking...and the game pretty much boils down to players pumping the turbo button over and over, more so than other hockey games.  But as much as the game follows the rules of hockey -- and I recommend turning off the offsides control unless you like the puck to freeze five times a minute -- the game features a lot of ~arcade-style~ elements. Power ups come into play, but the manual does a horrible job documenting what these do. These icons, if active, can pop up randomly in the middle of the rink, and when a player collects it the entire team gets its power. They range from the ability to knock an opponent on his ass just by touching him, to getting superspeed for a brief amount of time. There's also a ~rock-paper-scissors~ mode that pops up on occasion that, again, is horribly documented; the gist is, at some play stoppages, each team chooses rock, paper, or scissors...with the loser going to the penalty box. It's an interesting idea for a ~backyard~ sports game, but it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense in action.  Though the game features the NHL teams, there are only about ten pros in the game...and they're really just here in namesake only since their on-screen personality looks almost nothing like the real deal. And when players choose to play on a ~professional~ team like the Flyers or Devils (gee, guess where I'm from, huh?), those rosters are filled with the game's generic kids...not the actual professional players. So don't get into Backyard Hockey just because it has the NHL license...it's not money well spent for Atari.  But then we get into the presentation, and that's where the game shines. In fact, the development team can certainly take what they've created for Backyard Hockey and build up a true NHL game because the stuff that's going on in the background is pretty great. It tracks player statistics and saves a season in progress...albeit a very short season. The game features six distinctly different ice hockey rinks, two of which are hidden until they're unlocked. And then, there's the Air Hockey table that's a lot of fun in a simple kind of way; the Mul-T-Puck table is just that: an Air Hockey table that can have as many as three pucks going on at once if the triggers are hit during play. Both the ice hockey and air hockey games can be played via two player link as well. Playing Backyard Hockey makes me wish for the return of true hockey on the Game Boy Advance. There has only been one five-on-five hockey title on the handheld, and that's far too few if you ask me. The Backyard Hockey box should be plenty obvious that a real rendition of the sport isn't inside, but what's there isn't as bad as it appears to be. There's a lot of decent ideas and implementations in this kids' based hockey title...it just needs to be fleshed out in a true hockey experience for the pros.", "date": "Nov 8, 2003"}
