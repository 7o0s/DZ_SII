Are you bored with your current selection of Playstation games? Does the PC confuse and frustrate you with its hard-to-figure-out installation and mouse sensitivity options? Don't you just want to sit down and play a game that will make you laugh and cheer? A game that will have all your friends and family huddled around you, envious of the joy you are experiencing? Well my friends, I have such a game for you!!!    Glu has unleashed its greatest cell phone game ever and believe me when I tell you that the pleasure is all yours! Super Breakout has escaped from our secret gaming lab and is now running amok on your wireless device! Glu was going to hold off on this extraordinary gaming experience for the next century, nay millennium, because of it's groundbreaking brick colored graphics and futuristic looking paddle, but Glu cannot, and will not, keep this game to themselves! Super Breakout will guarantee you hours and hours of enjoyment! Super Mario World cannot offer such a guarantee!   So what's the catch you say? Do you merely give us a few levels and we have to pay for extra? No way. Not at Glu. Super Breakout offers not just 10, not just 20, not just 40, but 50 levels of block breaking awesomeness. We even offer bonus levels! That's right, BONUS LEVELS. Half Life 2 does not offer this! As you play levels key icons will appear! Grab them all to unlock secret bonus levels where you will experience point scoring madness! You will not find secret keys in Street Fighter 2!   Now I know what you're thinking...this is just another Breakout game where you control a paddle at the bottom of your screen, hitting the ball back up into the field and destroying blocks. Yes. It is that game. But it has SUPER before it. This makes it better than a regular version of a game. Bioshock does not have SUPER in front of it! If the ball gets past your paddle, you will lose a life. But you have continues, and can start off at the same stage. As you clear stages, you will accumulate points. Extra balls are earned every 25,000 points and you can even catch extra ball icons if you're lucky! Tetris does not include extra ball icons! Each stage has 10 levels, and if you've found your keys, you can play the bonus levels before moving on. What other game offers this type of added excitement? Frogger does not!    But you're not just hitting a plain old ball, no sir. Super Breakout even has power ups to assist you in your quest. Counter-Strike is absent of power ups! What can you get to help you? Just a few of the amazing power ups included in this action packed game are:   Multi-Ball: Splits your ball into three, giving you three times the brick busting fun!  Blaster: Shoot the bricks! Destroy everything!   Heavy Ball: Watch the now glowing ball plow through the bricks! It's too wicked rad for words!  Safety Net: Saves the ball in case you miss it! Saving your fun in the process!  Clock: This will slow down the ball. The ball never goes fast enough for you to worry about having to slow it down, but we've included it anyway! (Glu's not cheesy like those Arkanoid people.)   The graphics are futuristic and exciting! Controls are simple! Use the center pad to move your paddle left and right. Use the 5 or center button to launch your ball. The controls are smooth and it's easy to move your paddle left and right. The only thing hard to control in this game is your will to put it down so you can go eat dinner! As a bonus, we've even included fun to listen to music and futuristic sound effects! Guitar Hero does not offer music or fun sound effects!    Ok, so the ball's movements are questionable at best. Sometimes it appears that the ball will magically float towards that last brick helping you to clear the stage. Do not confuse this for bad physics! And a lot of times power ups will appear out of nowhere helping you clear the stage of those stubborn and hard to reach last bricks. Do not think of this as lazy programming! Just think of it as the game wanting you to continue on to the next fantastic stage! This game loves you!! World of Warcraft does not love you!    By the time you get to Stage 5, you'll be all too familiar with the swirling vortexes that make your ball disappear and then reappear in another part of the game screen! Think of them as ball teleporters and some stages cannot be completed without them! Yes, they can sometimes be frustrating, and in Stage 5-1 you can get the ball caught in an endless loop where it gets stuck going back and forth between two vortexes as you watch in amazement and have to start the level over. But do not be discouraged! We did not foresee this and guarantee you that this will only happen once or twice during the game! Maybe three times...We are not done with you yet! Included with your purchase of Super Breakout is the original Breakout! YES! The original Breakout! For the old school and the new school player in you, you will be satisfied with all of this extra bonus material! You may have played 5,000 different versions of Breakout in your lifetime and are tired of its repetitiveness, but this Breakout version is the best one of all! And it has the original Atari 2600 font!", "date": "Dec 10, 2007"}
