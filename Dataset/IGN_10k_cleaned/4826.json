Gameloft followed the successful blaster up with an Episode II, containing five additional levels of shooting madness against the Stalin-bot's empire -- and we were just as eager to get back in the cockpit.   Features:   Five new missions  Plethora of plane power-ups  Five boss machines   Now, we've long discussed and ragged on the problems associated with the shooter genre's appearances on handsets on this page. Most games feature an auto-fire because jamming on a ~shoot~ key while trying to move around just isn't practical on today's handsets. Some developers have figured out how to construct a competent shooter with this feature/handicap in mind, such as Upstart Games and Cave.    Siberian Strike manages to beat the pack by still engaging the player to unleash a torrent of bullets with button inputs. Press the button once and your plane with spit a series, but not an endless one, of bullets. Hold down the fire key and a small meter will appear beneath your ship. Depending on how full the meter is when you release, a fat laser beam of the R-Type variety erupts from your fantastic flying machine.   You also needn't be content with just two bullets for each volley, either. A variety of power-ups will juice your plane's firepower, enabling you to ground more Stalin-bot planes and tanks with fewer shots. In addition to greater shots, you can also use screen-clearing bombs to wipe out unmanageable hordes of Soviet gear. (It's accompanied by a wave effect that causes the screen to shimmy like the start of a ~Sesame Street~ dream sequence.)   The five levels in Siberian Strike -- Episode II look fantastic. Each level is detailed and colorful -- and looks quite different from the last one. The skies above the frozen wasteland fill with plenty of aircraft, but the framerate takes no hits. The enemies are also fairly varied -- it's not quite the cast of a console shooter, but with memory always an issue with handset games, Episode II's rogue gallery is suitable.Siberian Strike -- Episode II is a true winner with excellent action and great control. Gameloft is known for classy productions, and this blaster is no exception. The graphics are bright and detailed -- especially on the N-Gage QD we used to test the game. While the sound could have used a little extra juice, them's the breaks in an otherwise superlative game. If you're a shooter fan and Siberian Strike -- Episode II is on your deck, direct your download dollars its way. You won't be disappointed. Unless you're a shooter snob. And then you should just be playing with your Super Gun, not a cellphone.", "date": "Jul 7, 2004"}
