Poker has seen increased exposure, thanks to the multiple celebrity poker tourneys on television in the past months. (Speaking of, did you see David Cross gut Scott Stapp at the table on Bravo? Awesome television.) Does Downtown's take know when to hold 'em, or does it have a weak hand?   Features:   Quick games or Career Mode  Multiple casinos  Music   Downtown Texas Hold 'Em is certainly no-nonsense Texas Hold 'Em-style poker, and for that, it deserves serious kudos. Not every card game requires bells, whistles and gimmicks to be successful -- Downtown knew that, done well, Texas Hold 'Em can stand on its own. And in Downtown Texas Hold 'Em, it does.   The game is set up exactly as you would expect. You sit at a table with four other players -- all governed by decent AI. Each player is dealt two cards, then the betting begins. Stakes are raised and called, the flop is revealed (three cards), and then betting begins again. It sounds so basic, but if you've ever played the game in real life, you know how exciting it can truly be. When the table is down to you and one other cat, and you suspect he's got the unseen queen -- whew.   About that computer AI. It's good, but not great. A couple times, I was able to goad the computer into going all-in early on when I had a great hand. That doesn't happen often in real life. All-ins usually are withheld for killer hands (which the computer didn't have) or way later in the game. However, it's always nice to play with somebody mildly unpredictable, and perhaps that's what Downtown programmed the computer to do from time to time. Throw you a loop by putting in all n the line with nothing. Bluff me, will you?   Downtown Texas Hold 'Em has multiple modes of play. Quick game allows you just to sit down at the table and play a few hands. It's a good way to practice. Once you think you got the stuff, try out Career Mode and play at five different tables -- each with steadily rising stakes and difficulty -- for the title of World Champion.   The game looks the part. The tables are colorful, if not terribly detailed. What counts more, though, is that the cards are easily readable and the in-game text and menus look clean. Downtown Texas Hold 'Em succeeds here. Also pleasing is the background music.Downtown Texas Hold 'Em is an excellent little poker sim, sure to pleased fans of the game -- whether you're a grizzled pro or a beginner who just got into it. Downtown delivers a great, respectable game of poker without mudding it up with unnecessary extras. A worthwhile download that will keep you busy for some time.", "date": "May 7, 2004"}
