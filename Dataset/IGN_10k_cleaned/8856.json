This is a simple puzzle game embellished with element of the Spider-Man universe -- more specifically, the third movie. And while the game itself may not exactly light the decks on fire, there's something to be said for honesty in advertising.   The core of the game is a match-three puzzler in the vein of Bejeweled and Jewel Quest. You swap colored spheres, trying to like up combos that reveal a path through the playing field underneath. By uncovering the path, a Spider-Man head crosses the field en route to an exit. You are racing against time, so while you can match anywhere on-screen, you need to make sure you keep Spidey moving along.   Spider-Man has a handful of specials you can use to help clear the path. By matching special sphere, you fill up special move meters, including rage and shuffle. You can use these specials at your discretion. The shuffle move rearranges the spheres in case you get stuck. The rage move blasts the Spider-man head several steps down the path, even pushing through blockers. The red Spider Sense power temporarily reveals the path. This last skill is particularly useful when you're on the run from Venom's black goo. The goo snakes along the path, hounding your every move. If it catches up with you while you're trying to figure out which spheres to match, you lose a life.   Essentially, this is just another take on Jewel Quest -- and admittedly, I grew listless after only a handful of levels. I pressed on to see what new challenges the game offered, such as the goo, and any new special pieces that might radically alter game play. Nope. Even with the smattering of Spider-Man elements, this is the same puzzle game we've all been playing for years.   The game screen is certainly colorful and I never had any control problems. To use the skills, you simply move the cursor to the bottom of the screen. The game features some decent music.I wholly understand the impetus to make the most of such a recognizable license -- but while playing Spider-Man 3 Puzzle, I was distinctly reminded of one of the first mobile games ever reviewed on IGN Wireless: Fury of the Hulk. The comparison is not one I wanted to make -- a Hulk game starring a giant green fist? And now a match-three puzzle game starring a Spider-Man head? You are better off with EA Mobile's new online edition of Bejeweled, PopCap's Chuzzle, or i-Play's Jewel Quest.", "date": "Aug 2, 2007"}
