That's not an attempt to degrade it, since this is a fine game for what it sets out to do, but to emphasize the fact that it's much, much different from the PS2's higher-profile snowboarding franchise.  As befits the realistic presentation, borrowing heavily from the telecasts of ESPN's extreme-sports carnival and featuring real licensed riders and settings, this is a serious snowboarding simulation -- you can get pretty rad, but more or less within the constraints of reality that EA Sports Big throws completely out the window.  This was the case with the first X Games snowboarder, which ran up against the original SSX in much the same way around the time of the PS2 launch.  This sequel has been beefed up substantially in the features department, with more tracks to use and a substantial new career mode, but the big question remains the same -- is a sim up your alley?  If so, this is an excellent sim, and you'll certainly enjoy it.  If not, do you have anything in particular against Run-DMC?  Gameplay  X Games is broken up into challenges of pure racing (Time Attack), pure tricks (Big Air/Halfpipe), and a little of each (Slopestyle).  It's no surprise that the last is the most compelling, but luckily that's where the bulk of the competitions lie in both X Games and Snowboarder modes.  The Slopestyle courses are much bigger than they were in last year's model, and there's a lot more emphasis on linked kickers and rails -- this isn't Tony Hawk, but the amount of trick potential has been expanded considerably within the constraints of this game's particular paradigm.  Do the controls let you take advantage of that potential, though?  At times, it feels as if the game strays too far from the thin line between realism and fun.  The key to performing spins and flips effectively is mastering the timing of button inputs -- the direction and button commands for something like a backflip or misty flip have to precisely accompany the release of the X button to start a jump.  Hit the trick inputs too early or too late and it's either a crash (as you fail to rotate fast enough and land on your head) or a dead sailor (or whatever they call that in snowboarding).  The commands to cut off a flip seem very unresponsive, too, making crashes due to overrotation fairly common, particularly in cases where the camera doesn't pick a high enough angle to show the ground coming up well in advance.  Learning to adjust your expectations clears up those problems after a while, as does practicing the persnickety launch timing, and the new rail controls work very well, adapting the Tony Hawk scheme with a simple tap of the triangle button to lock into a grind.  On a clear day, as it were, you can slide forever, switching stances as you go.  It's perhaps a little telling that this, the least realistic aspect of the trick controls, also happens to be the one that's easiest to get a handle on, but that way lies madness.  Speaking of madness, the Snowboarder mode, which may either prove an exceptional diversion or drive you completely nuts.  This is a variation on the kind of career mode that's become a staple in many other extreme-sports titles -- you build a snowboarder and set off on the road to sponsored TV glory.  Your rookie snowboard avatar enters competitions, spends winnings at the local board shop, and eventually moves on to filming sessions and the big-time comps, building statistics and abilities all the way.  An excellent idea, at leas in theory.  The trouble with Snowboarder mode is that it's very frustrating in the early going, before your boarder's stats are built up to pro level.  Low stats mean poor speed and trick capabilities.  This, in turn, means it's hard to land tricks, which you have to do to win the lucrative slopestyle competitions.  A tough time landing tricks means crashes.  Crashes mean you wind up in the hospital -- you have a life meter, and if it runs out, you're out of a comp and in the ER.  This means bills, which sap your reserves of cash and make it hard to buy new gear and enter comps...do you feel the vicious cycle?  It's very difficult to go from the regular X Games mode, with its able pro riders, to the clumsy newbies of the career mode.  Just turning is difficult -- if you get stuck in switch stance it's nearly impossible, although the switch command is reasonably responsive.  Building up to a level where you can do anything interesting requires some long hours of fumbling around and building up statistics little by little.  Some will have the patience for this, and they will eventually be rewarded, but many likely won't find it worth the bother.  Graphics  The same rule of thumb applies to visuals as well as gameplay, it seems.  This is a fine re-creation of reality -- not flashy, but solid, and possessed of some nice details if you're willing to look for them.  The framerate is fine, certainly, and the resolution never drops as the well-animated boarders slide down the mountain.  Lighting is subtle, but effective, as are the realtime character shadows (no fuzzy circles here), and mist/spark effects.  Snow trails vary in width according to the orientation of the sliding board, and stuttering skids are reflected appropriately as well.  The player models even look good during the pre-race closeups, and the OSA team's artists have gone to the trouble to mix some cool facial animation in with the usual posing (smiles and slayers all round, faithful to the character of the real events).  The create-a-rider mode is unexpectedly deep as far as visual options go, too.  There are very few options when you initially generate a character in Snowboarder mode, but the shops contain a huge variety of pants, jackets, boots, hats, and goggles to kit out riders with sufficient cash.  If the in-game graphics only manage to be better than average, this is at least a brilliant piece of interface design, like the rest of the ESPN games lineup.  Overlays, transitions, and menus are all derived from the TV presentation, and they look great -- not so many load times in between them, too, and what loads there are feature a cute shuffling-snowboards screen.    Sound  We were discussing something interesting around the office today, and we'd appreciate your input.  Most of us here can't stand the Offspring...but only in an environment outside a videogame.  We'd never go see them live, and we change the channel when they're on the radio, but they seem to provide enjoyable accompaniment for games -- something about that dull pop-punk drone just works for snowboarding, BMX, crashing taxis, and so on.  Has anybody else noticed this phenomenon?  Returning to more pertinent issues, this is a perfectly acceptable alterna-rock soundtrack, with a few highlights from Jurassic 5 and the Damned (amazing to discover that someone actually remembers the Damned.  Man.  The Damned).  And ~Dammit I Changed Again,~ like I say, has that nastily catchy Offspring hook to it.  The effects suite, meanwhile, is a cut above, including the best announcer I've ever heard that isn't Rahzel.  The pro riders get various biographical tidbits, while the game regularly assigns the created snowboarders new silly nicknames based on their performance.  A small touch, but it certainly adds.Let us reiterate the eternal question once more for the record.  This is a sim, not an arcade game, so adjust your expectations appropriately.  X Games has limitations, and it has a learning curve, requiring that perspective pros learn to work within the confines of a realistic setting rather than launching themselves instantly into balls-out SSX-style insanity.  I've met a great many gamers who will have nothing but, and it's good to see Konami willing to address the interests of a smaller niche market.SSX Tricky inevitably remains the choice for a mass audience, even if it's actually strayed into a more demanding realm as well in comparison to its predecessor (funny to see these two sequels actually move a little bit closer to each other).  To each their own, though, and if never the twain shall meet, in this case that's a good thing for the game market as a whole.", "date": "Feb 21, 2002"}
