Mega Man certainly had a lot of them, but if we count expansion packs, I think we've got a new record. The Sims 2: Seasons makes the fifth expansion to The Sims 2, and the twelfth overall including the original Sims. Throw in three core games and three stuff packs, you're up to eighteen separate titles for The Sims on the PC alone.   Last time around, we got pets added to the mix. The greatest problem with the Pets expansion pack was the lack of any core gameplay additions, instead focusing on the four-legged critters that really didn't add that much to your little Sims' lives. Electronic Arts has greatly (and we can't stress ~greatly~ enough) made up for that with Seasons. This is, indeed, a true expansion pack, successful in every sense of the word.   The Sims - the original - had its Sims in perpetual time, never aging. The Sims 2 introduced time, as Sims age and die of natural causes. However, this time passing went largely unnoticed, because aside from the sun setting at the appropriate time, nothing changed.    The biggest addition Seasons gives to your families is the passage of time, and almost everything else in the game relates to it. Sims now suffer temperatures, which can cause sunburns if it's too hot or illness if it's too cold. Sims now, when they change clothes, change their temperature tolerances. A Sim in his underwear or swimwear whilst in the dead of winter will not be happy for very long. Leave a Sim kid out there in the same situation, and social services will come along and haul him away. A new clothing type, Outerwear, protects your Sims from the elements.   In addition to temperature, you'll see visual indications as well. Weather is finally a part of the game, and you'll see rain and snow fall in their appropriate seasons. Snow actually sticks to the ground and, in the case of a house without roofs, furniture and objects. Download the tree, kinara, and menorah from the official Sims 2 website, and you'll really be able to set up some Christmas, Kwanza, and Chanukah memories.   Speaking of objects, there are plenty of new ones, both for homes and the community. You can set up skating rinks, both of the ice and roller variety; if you have Open for Business as well, you can have a family own one of these places as well.   As always, the game is very customizable. You can set the seasons and in what order they occur. If you just hate autumn for some reason, you can trade it out for something else. You must have four, but you can have two periods of winter and two periods of spring, for example. This works well for neighborhoods that are in the desert, for example, which wouldn't see anything but summer all year round.    EA added farming and fishing, which can turn into money or food. Farming is pretty deep in and of itself, as you can have your Sims join the new Garden Club. Sims can turn into Leaf Sims if they garden enough, which gives them odd farming-type abilities and a slick green skin tone. They can be cured of this if it's not easy being green, but a little variety in the neighborhood never hurt. Greenhouses let you farm all year, as well as giving the lot a cool look. Produce can be blended together to make potions that can give your Sims a bit of a boost as well.   As if this all wasn't enough, there's a ton of little additions that would go unnoticed by anyone but longtime Sim fans. Six new careers have been added, giving your Sims the ability to dip into journalism, law, music, adventuring, education, or - our personal favorite - professional gamer. (The first time I saw that the starting level of the Gamer Career Track was ~Noob,~ I smiled.) Other little things, like new social activities and the ability to put away leftovers in the fridge, deepen the experience further.   Everything new in Seasons is easy to grasp right out of the box. Numerically, Seasons doesn't add a tremendous number of objects; however, it will take you many hours to see and do everything, and even then, you'll want more.   The graphics and sound are largely unchanged, but that's not surprising. If you've used your MP3 collection for the Sim radio, you won't have any reason to give it up. Graphically, while the enhanced weather effects are slick, nothing has been overhauled. Par for the course, really: the gameplay additions are tremendous, but everything else? Not so much.Seasons is one of the most significant expansion pack of The Sims 2. This one is a must-buy with the The Sims 2, whether youre picking up The Sims for the first time or have been at it for over seven years like us. The only thing missing is a new external area (like the colleges of University, the downtown areas of Nightlife, and the tiny shopping village of Open For Business).There is no question that the previous expansion packs (especially University and Pets) wore out their welcome after a while. However, youll be playing with the effects of Seasons probably for the rest of your life  or if/until a The Sims 3 comes out.Dont get us wrong; if you havent been a fan of The Sims before, this isnt going to convert you or anything. But if you like it at all, everything in this expansion is simply pure icing. Pick it up; you wont be disappointed.", "date": "Mar 20, 2007"}
