The game eventually hit retail stands in spring 1997, along with a four-player mode, and launched with the first Rumble Pak in North America. It was quite exciting to play a ~next-generation~ game like that, and yet at the same time that we also got to glimpse quick video clips of a little known game that simply blew it away. Psygnosis' StarFox killer for the PlayStation, Colony Wars, went on to become a very popular game indeed, and spawned three games in the series to StarFox's one (on N64). Because I ran N64.com at the time (later to be renamed to IGN64.com), the thought of a better game on a system with less ~bits~ was rather depressing.   Nearly three years later, Colony Wars is in its third rendition with Red Sun, a game that's being created from the ground up with a whole new Psygnosis team, which has implemented a slightly different view on the venerable series. Perhaps, in light of the oncoming arrival of PS2, fewer people care about PlayStation games, and in particular this series, but it would be a mistake to ignore this massive, highly compelling new version of the series.   Gameplay The first Colony Wars blended prerendered FMV cut-scenes with gorgeous looking crafts placed in various deep space situations to create an atmosphere that looked better than any console game had delivered before. The graphics were still great looking the second time around and the gameplay still quite fresh, but now, in the third try, Red Sun is a funny creature. It's no longer the new kid on the block, and because of the system's near eclipse by PS2, it appears that few people give a damn about the game, or perhaps they have simply seen enough.    To be frank, the series hasn't lost too much of its charm. Using nearly all of my good graces with my wife, I have spent the last few nights playing into the depths of the night playing Red Sun. It's compelling despite its few problems, and it's still great shooting goodness, despite some of the novelty that's worn off from the first two, and it brings up some of the same old philosophical problems that both CW 1 and 2 first opened up.   Straight at the heart of the matter is the gameplay, in which Red Sun doesn't tread new water. The game is still a great looking shooter, but it doesn't reinvent the genre. The mission selection ranges from locate-and-defend, protect convoy, search-and-destroy, with the occasional grapple mission thrown in. The best new levels include ~jumping~ from asteroid shadows in search of an idol, uncloaking mineral rich asteroids while fighting off enemy ships, and the detachment of the solar wings on an enemy space station. While it wasn't too new in design, one of the best levels was the fight to Defend Marjorie's Kitchen. It's a massive space onslaught, in which literally dozens of enemy fighters swarm the station that you and a few allies must defend. You're totally outnumbered, and the enemy comes from all angles to attack, but the rush of an all-out massive attack is still a wild thrill that can't be beat. Even the miniscule slowdown is totally forgettable.   Red Sun does several things that the first two games didn't. First, it's finish-able. Really. I never finished the first two despite all my hours spent playing them, and I always had put the burden on myself. The fact is that both of those games were just too damn hard. You can actually finish this game, which is quite a feat for the series. The game does away with the branching paths of the past and has been streamlined into a linear A-to-B style game as well, and so it simplifies the game, but I don't mind it. It's not dumbed down. Complain if you will, but remember that because of this honed down version you will get to the end.   In choosing levels, of which there are about 50 taking place on land or in space, players will venture in planetary systems from the previous game, plus four new systems to explore. Instead of making choices in the branching system, once players move on from one system, or hub, to the next, they have a choice of several missions that they can choose in any order.   Because you are a mercenary and, I guess a rather good mechanic, you now have more choices in ships. The inventory/exchange system has been revamped, and in my humble opinion, for the better. First, each mission earns you cash, freeing you up to buy new ships and weapons. Instead of simply acquiring new ships by beating a new level, you will not only unlock a new ship, but you'll be able to choose it or any of the other ships you have already unlocked. So, theoretically, once you have finished the game, you'll have eight ships unlocked. This just means you can specialize in the ship of your choice, as long as you can buy it. The weapons and parts work the same way. After each mission, you need to check inventory and reload weapons, or sell old ones in exchange for new ones. It's a simple yet versatile system, and one much preferred over the past solutions. There are 44 items altogether.   Some people may not like the new weapon system, which is more flexible in exactly how you attack and defend. While in the first two, players relied heavily on switching from specialized weapon to weapon, Red Sun includes several weapons that serve more than one purpose. For instance, players can choose a weapon that's sole purpose is to knock down shields, while also choosing a complementary weapon that's only good for blowing up hulls. The two fit lock and key. But now, players can choose these two, or several new weapons that effectively perform both tasks. They're more expensive, so they're harder to continually buy, but they delete the need for the old complementary system. The point the new Psygnosis Leeds team wanted to make was to provide the choice for either style. But with undisciplined, lazy gamers such as myself, I'll always choose the easier, more expensive weapon. In my mind, it's worth the cost. The ultimate effect on the game isn't only more choice, but rather one that makes the game easier to play. For some, that might be bad. Personally, I'm just glad I could get to the damn ending!   Another big change is in the ship designs. Past designs have fallen into stark military designs, but in Red Sun, they have become less so, and in my mind, too pedestrian. The worst example is this Red Baron ship, that's A) red; B) complete with three wings; C) looks like the Red Baron's Fokker Triplane. Did I already say red? Where's the frickin' Sopwith Camel? It's cute, but it's totally out of place for the serious, humorless world of Colony Wars.   On the other hand, the bulk of the ships are still great looking, with lots of anthropomorphic shapes thrown in. And though they were few, I enjoyed the creature designs, too, especially the AI controlled pachoderms and the space Jellies, which added a lot of variety.   Graphics The graphics in the Colony Wars series have always been amazing, and Red Sun is no different than former versions. While lighting techniques have been improved and new kinds of space phenomena have been implemented, such as more nebulae, more lighting effects, and the like, the game doesn't appear to be any more beautiful than its predecessors. I suppose the biggest and most noticeable changes are that there appear to be more land-based and non-space style missions, which means that while there is more purposeful fogging, at least we don't always have to stare at the blackness of space.   As for the cut scenes, the facial expressions of Valdemar and his female sidekick are almost great. The faces almost look real, but slight robotic expressions and stiff default expressions can't convince me that these folks are real or even human.   My biggest problem with the cut-scenes is that they're too damn short. They are so cut up and staggered that they provide little feeling. I mean, as Valdemar, you're supposed to be on a kind of spiritual quest, in search of solving the mystery of the Red Sun, and making sense of it all in between each level. But the cu-scenes are so damn short, just as soon as you start digging your mental hooks into the story, the cut-scene ends, and you're left feeling abandoned. What did I just hear? Why did they only say only two sentences to each other? What did that mean? The questions I have from one set of missions to the next cut-scene don't get answered, and then a whole new five-second cut-scene shows me something totally obscure, and so I end up with a whole new set of questions that aren't answered. I wish the scenes were longer, which would have helped create a better sense of continuity.   Perhaps even more to the point, I wish that the cutscenes had more to do with the actual missions, too. Red Sun delivers a story that seems to wrapped around missions that relate to it, but in the end, they produce the opposite feeling, detachment. If the missions somehow tied more in with the story, as in real functional ways, the whole game would feel more complete, more organic. I mean, sure the Red Sun's development is really neat, but it feels like something that's happening in a different story, or even worse, backstage, except that you don't have backstage passes. As it is delivered, the somewhat interesting story of the Red Sun manifests in forced, stilted storyboard fashion that fits messily in between basic shooting levels.   Sound One of the best aspects of Red Sun is its soundtrack, which is recorded by the Midland Symphony Orchestra. The orchestral music washes in with sweeping, majestic waves of energy and power, and it appears to react directly to the gameplay experience itself. For instance, I can recall situation after situation in which an enemy fleet arrives just as the music tempo reaches a titanic crescendo. For those with good stereos, this game supports Dolby Surround Sound, so it's really meant to be delivered with a good set of speakers. I recommend turning down the lights and cranking up the volume for a whopping experience. Even better is a set of headphones. The soundtrack is great, and so are the swarms of sound effects. Everything from the ship's rocket boosters, to the breakdown of your shield, the destruction of an enemy ship, or the sound of a missile being launched, sounds magnificent. Hardcore fans of the series will still like this game, as long as they aren't too rigid. The linearity, something I normally criticize in a shooter such as this, is actually a good thing here, at least as the game stands. And, players still have lots of non-linear aspects to revel in, such as the alteration of eight different ships, the choice of missions in a hub, and the ability to constantly upgrade. If you have the cash, you can do it. Also, while the ship designs have been better, and the weapons system a little more complex, and the game a little harder in the former two games, Red Sun is strangely a much better all around game. My biggest criticisms for Colony Wars fall into two categories, story and gameplay (just minor issues...:)). The story here, while a decent one, isn't told through the game itself. It's told through cold, distant FMVs that feel like they're from another game. They predictable fall in between each level, and never join the shooting style levels with the story itself. When the next Psygnosis team can create cut-scenes using the game engine that occur in unpredictable instances in the middle of the game, and fuse the story into the game, that'll be something to rave about. As for the gameplay, yeah sure, I love to push my carpels to the limit just like the next guy, shooting everything in site as fast as physics will allow, but isn't there more creative stuff that can complement the shooting levels? Rescuing the aforementioned idol in subspace is just one example of how the standard shooter can evolve. Wouldn't it be cool if instead of just rescuing the idol, and leaving through the jump gate, I used a secret device that enabled me to shut down the enemy ship, which I could then board? This would send new alarmed enemies my way, but I could then unsuspectingly blast the be-Jesus out of them when they arrived on the scene. I could then bring the new technology back to my home base and use the ship for future stealth missions that required that very ship. Even if this scenario sounds ludicrous the point is that there should more than just the same old ~defend the convoy,~ ~protect the disabled comrade while he gets his sh%t together~ levels that we are all really tired of. Colony Wars' biggest flaw, really, is that it's still the same old game, just organized better and with better sound and graphics. It's good but it's time for something new. Perhaps Colony Wars 4 on PlayStation 2 will be the trick. Editor's note: The first two Colony Wars games received great scores from us, and Red Sun is quite a good game, but at this point in the system's history it no longer qualifies as a 9+ game.", "date": "Jun 14, 2000"}
