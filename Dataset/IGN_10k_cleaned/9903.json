It's difficult to do, because the series has spanned so many different companies' consoles and been re-branded in so many different ways. But it's also worthwhile, because many are worth a look like Monster Lair. This game, if you trace its roots, first originated as ~Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair,~ an arcade cabinet in 1988. It was later ported to the Genesis, but only in Japan and Europe. Here in the States, we got this version for the TurboGrafx-CD.   Monster Lair lost its Wonder Boy affiliation in coming to the TG-CD in 1990, but it was otherwise an accurate and faithful adaptation of its arcade source. The game is a hybrid design between traditional platforming and a forced-scrolling shooter. You control either a boy or girl hero in side-scrolling stages, hopping along and either avoiding or blasting enemies while the screen constantly scrolls to the right. Then, after clearing one of those platforming levels, you're taken to an even more shooting-focused stage where you ride on a dragon with full freedom of movement. No platforms there, just straight-up forced-scroll shooting like any other cute-'em-up that might come to mind.   Boy, this sure looks like an inviting place. It's a back-and-forth balance, and one that works pretty well. The platforming levels play out like the earliest Wonder Boy -- or Adventure Island for fans more familiar with that franchise -- and, like those games, you have to constantly collect floating pieces of fruit in order to keep yourself alive. But, unlike those games, Monster Lair's like someone gave Master Higgins a gun instead of a throwing axe and skateboard. Your hero's sword here is a versatile projectile weapon, continuously launching ranged attacks across the screen and clearing the way for you to make the next right leap between platforms. Your weapon is upgradeable, too, gaining the power to fire rockets, shoot out spreading rings, fire piercing lasers and more.   The shooting-only levels maintain that same arsenal of potential power-ups, but otherwise feel quite a bit different. With no platforms to negotiate, it's all about dodging and blasting; and then, taking out the stage-end boss. These are your standard oversized monsters with lots of hit points and pattern-based attacks, but they're much more dynamic and interesting to face off against than the old cloned bosses from Wonder Boy/ Adventure Island.   For those that played the Genesis version, this CD edition is superior to what SEGA players saw in the early '90s, in both graphics and sound. The visuals are spot-on accurate to what the arcade original offered, and the CD-based soundtrack is robust and great to listen to. Monster Lair doesn't have the video sequences of some other TG-CD titles like The Dynastic Hero, but its music is unquestionably solid.   And also of worthwhile note is Monster Lair's two-player co-op mode, as this was the first time a Wonder Boy installment has offered the feature. Running, jumping and shooting alongside a friend turns out to be quite a bit of fun in this style of game, especially when you've both got your eye on grabbing the same piece of floating fruit.~Purist~ fans in the early '90s didn't appreciate the shift in design direction that Monster Lair took over earlier Wonder Boy adventures, as its heavy emphasis on shooting action, even when mixed in with more traditional platforming, was just too much of a departure from the status quo. And, in response, later Wonder Boy games went back to putting more focus on the platforming. But that reaction aside, Monster Lair is still a solid and fun experience. It's its own unique creation, and the way that it jumps back and forth between platforming and shooting helps to set it apart from the many other games from the era. If you're up for something that's a bit different, but that simultaneously holds some familiarity and connection to past platformers, give Monster Lair a look.", "date": "Jan 25, 2008"}
