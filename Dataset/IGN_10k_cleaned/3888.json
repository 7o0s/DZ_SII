Thanks to Incredible Technology's latest arcade smash, Golden Tee Golf and the company's luck at placing the machine in bars all over America, this image is starting to change. Now arcade gamers can be thought of as a group of unwashed drunks in polo shirts hanging around in darkened rooms cackling at each other. Isn't progress great? Those of you who have never spent an entire week in a bar trying to beat your last score won't understand what a relief it is that this game has finally been released for home systems. Those of you that have (and judging by the figures, that's a lot of you  according to the developers, over 750 million quarters have been dropped into these machines in the last couple of years), get ready to be slightly disappointed. Golden Tee for the home, while entertaining, just doesn't offer the same joys as its arcade counterpart.  First off, let's cover the basics of the game for those readers who actually have a life. Golden Tee Golf is an arcade golf simulator in the tradition of such past greats as Birdie King and Nintendo Golf. To start, you select the number of players (1 to 4), the style of play you'll be using (tournament or skins), and the course you'll be tackling (three are included in each release of the game). To tee off, you slowly pull back the trackball to start your backswing and then spin it forward to actually hit the ball. Distance and direction is determined from the angle and speed with which you spin the trackball. That's pretty much all there is to it.  So what is it that's different about the home version? Not much actually. The game looks just as good as its arcade counterpart, all of the options for play are there (and an extra 'shadow mode' that lets you play against your earlier scores has been added), and the sound is actually better than the original. So what's the problem? Unless your computer came equipped with a heavy-duty trackball, you're likely to find that the control system that made the arcade game so popular just doesn't translate that well to the PC. Although straight shots are easy enough to make, veterans of the arcade machine will find that judging speed and direction for draws and fades is nearly impossible with a mouse. Putting is also a bit tricky, as even the slightest touch of the mouse can send your shot powering off of the green.  So what's the final verdict? Even with its control problems, Golden Tee is still the best arcade golfing game available on the PC. Unlike Links or Jack Nicholas, you can get in a quick 18 holes in under half-an-hour, and you don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure out how to swing the club. And, even though arcade fans are sure to be frustrated by the game's handling, they will find that the ability to study the courses at their leisure is an invaluable tool in helping their scores when they do step up to the real thing. A nice diversion for the not so serious computer golfer. -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Aug 13, 1998"}
