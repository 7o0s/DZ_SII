However just because the sport isn't big in the U.S. doesn't mean we expect less from our videogames, and V-Rally seems extremely uninspired and unrefined for a game that had an extra year to incubate in Europe before coming to American stores.   The Features:  Officially licensed cars including American, European and Japanese nameplates Customizable car attributes  50 original tracks spread across the globe Varying terrain and weather conditions. Arcade, Championship, Training and Two players split screen modes.   Gameplay V-Rally has a lot going for it as far as simulation elements go with some well conceived original tracks and several fully licensed cars. There's something comforting about recognizing the cars and their names in a videogame and being able to race Ford Escorts and Toyota Corollas that look like real life cars is very nice. The problem with the game comes from three specific areas. There's simply not enough quality sound, the game has an overall dated look to it and the vehicle physics are too floaty even if this were an arcade game.   While we admit that we've never raced rally cars before, we do know from our driving experiences that cars do not float up into the air when you run up the side of an embankment and slowly roll over onto their roofs. We know what you're saying, ~You're supposed to stay on the track in racing games!~ While this is certainly the way to win, it's also very common for rally racing action to spill onto the environments around the track or for the track itself to be a little difficult to negotiate because of giant bumps, ditches or puddles. This is what makes it its own sport and different from NASCAR or F-1 racing.   V-Rally has too many simulation elements for the floaty car physics to be passed off as an ~arcadey~ type feature. Floaty physics in Beetle Adventure Racing or SF Rush actually add to those games because jumping and crazy stunts are supposed to be part of the games appeal. In V-Rally, because it's a rally racing sim, banging into a tree while you're flying at 120 miles an hour is supposed to bash your front end in. However because of the officially licensed cars, this is out of the question. The thing is, just because you can't tear up the front end of your little car doesn't mean it should slowly float up into a  dramatic pirouette whenever you slightly misjudge a turn.   The controls aren't the problem here since you can easily navigate the twists and turns of the course once you get the hang of it. But who among us has raced the perfect race from the time we picked up a game until the time we finished it. Heck, that would even be boring. The controls are solid and the Championship mode is typical racing fare and will give you a good sense of accomplishment.  The official cars are great and have snazzy paint jobs. For non rally racing fans you'll be able get a glimpse of some of the cool foreign hatchbacks that frequent the rally racing circuits. The cool things is the Escort, Hyundai Coupe and Corolla are all recognizable even though the cars are nowhere near the level of detail you'd see in a racing game like World Driver Championship   World Rally Cars  Toyota Corolla Subaru Impreza Mitsubishi Lancer Ford Escort   Kit Cars  Peugeot 306 Maxi Renault Megane Maxi Citroen XSARA SEAT Ibiza EV2 Skoda Octavia Vauxhall Astra Hyundai Coupe EV2 Nissan Almera   Graphics As we said the courses are original and you can recognize the differences between mountain tracks and the tropical areas, but the textures on the buildings and trees for the example aren't very detailed at all. When you get to some tracks like the English countryside and you're racing at dusk for example, the cars and track can look like two independent moving images instead of one visual experience resembling a car racing on a course.  The Locations  French Alps: This rally track right through the heart of the famous French mountain range requires full concentration and accurate turning England: Mud and rain abound in this little excursion into the English countryside Spain: Tear up some terra rossa on these winding roads through Spain's dusty backroads Sweden: Green pastures and plenty of trees. Was that an elk? Whoops. Corsica: Speed through the beautiful orange and palm tree groves of the Mediterranean island New Zealand: Unpredictable terrain can make your drive quite a ride Indonesia: Mud patches and poor visibility characterize the race through the tropical rainforest   There's some pretty harsh draw-in and the overly blurry look can really get to you after awhile. All of these combine to really make V-Rally look a lot older than a supposedly new game is supposed to look. Since most sports games coming out this fall usually end in a 2000, maybe there's a reason why this one still has the '99 suffix. On the bright side, the cars look very good  on the menu screens as they rotate around on display. The headlight lighting feature in night races is pretty nice too and really adds to the challenge of night racing since you can only see what you're headlights are aiming at.  Sound The good: There are distinct engine noises for the different cars that you're racing against and they correspond to the shift timing. Engine's rev higher when the wheels lose contact with the road and there's plenty of squealing when you peel out.  The bad: There's no music when you're racing and a very simple repetitive tune on the main menu screen. When you first turn the game on you'll get a rocking little tune on the title screen as you watch replays of the game in action.  The ugly: Cars don't go ~gonk~ when they crash broadside into a stone wall. Even worse, never has a car made no noise at all when it runs into a tree. Having had some experience at smashing into trees, we know that there is at least a crunch when this happens. How about a little squeak or scraping noise when the cars rub up against each other?  Needless to say the bad and ugly certainly outweigh the good, so much so that it really robs a lot of life out of this game. Even decent sound would've made a huge difference in making V-Rally a better game. V-Rally would've been a much more palatable game if it had come to the U.S. last year. It would've been judged a lot differently against the N64's strong stable of racing games including World Driver and Beetle Adventure Racing. This game is so similar to the European version that came out last year, that we couldn't find any significant improvements that would've warranted holding it back. Give it a rent to see if it does anything for you, otherwise wait for Infogrames' promising Test Drive Rally or Kemco's far superior Top Gear Rally 2.", "date": "Sep 23, 1999"}
