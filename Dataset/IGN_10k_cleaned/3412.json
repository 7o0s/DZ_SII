{"name": "Lunar Legend", "name_review": "Lunar Legend", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/02/03/lunar-legend", "text": "is another one of those Game Boy Advance games that will be flagged as a ~console port,~ since it's essentially based upon the Lunar: Silver Star Story design released on the PlayStation in 1999 (and well before that on the Sega CD). But even though its blueprint is the console game, Ubi Soft and GameArts made the GBA version more than a simple port. As engrossing as the storytelling is, it can't make up for its slightly sloppy gameplay implementation; certain glitches and design elements remove the challenge from the GBA version. Features Dozen hour quest Link cable support for trading earned cards Cartridge save (two slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  While the game is more or less the same formulaic RPG that other games, like Golden Sun and Breath of Fire have already done on the system, Lunar Legend's strength lies in its storytelling abilities. Its use of several different still poses for each of the characters really conveys emotion during conversation, as each text window shows just how each character is delivering his or her lines. The dialogue has been re-edited for the Game Boy Advance version in comparison to the Working Design-translated PSX edition, but the storyline remains the same, as does each character's delivery during the intermission plot points. Half the adventure is character development, and Lunar Legend is extremely successful in creating a moving plot with likable (and not-so-likable) characters.   The gameplay isn't quite as successful as the storytelling abilities, as it really doesn't offer much more than the same wander-the-land, random battle design that's been done umpteen times before on other systems. There's nothing terrible about the battle system, though, other than the fact that it does rely on random-encounters...a Japanese RPG design element that just doesn't want to go away, and it's really getting tiring in this day and age. Battle sequences are standard fare, with not a whole lot of glitz and flash to the fights. Players can opt to have the computer do all the fighting for them, which is definitely handy but not quite as reliable as choosing each character's attacks by hand. But a small control issue makes the manual fighting a bit clumsy: if the button's held down after choosing ~attack~, the game will register the first available enemy...so players have to be extra quick getting off the A button when choosing that menu option.  The Sega CD and PlayStation's extensive full-motion video sequences throughout certain areas of the adventure have been rightfully eliminated from the Game Boy Advance version; when you've got a game on a limited eight megabyte cartridge, the extraneous, non-vital elements just have to go. But just as much new stuff has been added in: the entire game's maps, backgrounds, and sprites have been reworked, though they use the original source as a blueprint. The game looks just like the original Sega CD and PSX design, but the artwork has actually been recreated to make the images appear natural and vibrant on the Game Boy Advance's LCD screen. Luna's vocal tracks have been taken out as well, save the single digitized melody that she sings whenever the dialogue calls for the girl to belt out a song. The familiar, orchestrated-style background music from the original Lunar: Silver Star Story is in the handheld game, though the instruments aren't quite as nice or subtle; Alex's ocarina, for example, blares sharply and somewhat drowns out the other instruments that accompany the melody.  But even as the developers try to keep with the original Lunar Silver Star Story experience, they felt the need to add to the already classic design...which is, I guess, why the game's called Legend and not Silver Star Story. Though anyone new to the game will find these additions natural, purist Lunar: SSS fans will definitely take notice to these inclusions. Most obvious is, of course the tweaked battle system with a brand new feature, the Critical Attack System. As players advance through battles, a meter at the bottom of their character stats builds; when it's full, players can activate that player's series of special attacks that can take off a good amount of points in one shot. Other additions include new side quests as well as a new Pokemon-style collection features where players collect cards during the quest. This is actually the weakest of all the additions, even though this seems like it would be the most significant. The cards are simple graphic squares with one of sixty different enemy sprites plastered on it. That's it. The idea is to collect 'em all for bragging rights (and possibly adding a new option or two to the gameplay), but these cards are so underwhelming in looks that it doesn't really offer that much encouragement to collect and trade them with your Lunar-playing friends.  There are also significant bugs in the Game Boy Advance version, including a situation that can be exploited for additional items, which can easily give players almost infinite coin if they continue to utilize this bug for their benefit. There's also an element where loading a saved game will offer completely refreshed and revitalized characters, and this, too, can be exploited to make the game easier...but since it's easy to regain health in the GBA version already, this is minor. I am aware the fanbase the Lunar series has captured over the years. But I honestly can't ignore some of the issues I had when playing through the GBA version...an ~enhanced~ version of a PlayStation game I had reviewed almost four years ago. The story is absolutely wonderful, with great use of sprite animations and still images to convey emotion during the conversation. Some moments really do tug at the heartstrings, which is a rare accomplishment in a Game Boy game. But that doesn't mean the whole package is successful -- the battle engine is simply an average execution of the standard turn-based random encounters that's in every other Japanese RPG design. And the difficulty level seems to have been cranked so far down that it's near impossible to lose a fight...and even if you're low on health, all it takes is to save the game and restore it for a refreshed party. The console version's the better choice, naturally...but if you're just looking for an engrossing tale of adventuring, this is a decent game to pick up for a lengthy gaming session. Just don't expect a challenging quest.", "date": "Feb 3, 2003"}
