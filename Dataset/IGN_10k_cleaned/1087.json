For example, there was this guy, whom we'll just call Dave for demonstration purposes, that was about $25,000 in debt and was barely making his rent payments each month. One month, because of excess car repairs, he was short $200 on his already late rent payment and didn't know what to do. Then it came to him -- he decided to make the 90 minute trek to the Reno strip and try to use the money that he did have for the partial payment of rent to win enough money to make the rent payment and possibly even get himself out of debt entirely.   Being a novice, Dave figured that he'd do something simple and since he didn't like his chances with the slots, he headed straight to the blackjack tables. Much to his chagrin, the cheapest tables in the casino that he went to was $50 per bet. Figuring that it would only take four small victories to win enough to pay the rent, he figured that he should just go for it. And, he did. First hand -- BAM, Black Jack. In the casino for less than a minute and he was already $50 richer. Next hand, he gets dealt a Jack of spades and a 10 of diamonds -- he stays. The dealer busts, so all of a sudden Dave is $100 ahead and already thinking of champagne wishes and caviar dreams.   It all went down hill from there. After the first two triumphant victories, the poor lost soul didn't manage to win another hand. When he got 21, the dealer matched it. Whatever he got, the dealer one-upped him. He quickly went from being $100 ahead and only $100 away from being able to pay his full rent to not having enough money to buy a 39-cent cheeseburger from McDonalds. Completely distraught, Dave figured that he couldn't let it end like this so he headed to the cashier in an attempt to borrow enough money to try to win it all back. Despite his bad credit, he was able to get a high-interest loan of $1,000 (by the way, it wouldn't been enough to pay the rent). His string of bad luck continued and he lost it all in a mere five minutes. In less than an hour, Dave went from being $200 short on rent to having no money at all and an extra $1,000 plus in debt (we won't even bring up the fact that he also got a $150 speeding ticket driving back home).   Gambling is very ill, indeed. So, why bring up this story in what should just be a quick and simple review of a videogame? Well, because Caesars Palace 2000: Millennium Gold Edition is a game that's probably designed for people just like this Dave person. Maybe if he would've tried his luck at a videogame representation of gambling, he wouldn't have thought that winning the dream house was going to be a piece of cake.   Gameplay There's not a lot of fluff here. Despite the background of Caesars Palace, where you'll find a world resplendent in regal pleasures, there's nothing in this beyond the games. This isn't really a bad thing, because it's the games that really matter, but it would've been nice to see a high quality of presentation.   However, it is all about the games and this title has plenty of those. Players can participate in a variety of casino gambling opportunities including Card Games, Table Games, Slot Machines, and Video Games. These include favorites like Blackjack (Dave's personal fave), Mini Baccarat, Paigow Poker, Spanish 21, Red Dog, Casino War, Roulette, Craps, Video Poker, Video Keno, Poker Challenge, and five different slot machines.   All of the games all appear to be based on the authentic rules and the slot machines have facings that actually look like the real thing. The interface is quite intuitive and there are plenty of buttons that have been mapped to allow players to do certain things, such as throwing the coins into the machines, with a quick press of a button.   Many of the games are quite enjoyable, but the truth of the matter is that it never quite matches the thrill of the real thing. While it's definitely a good thing that players gambling in Caesars Palace 2000 will never have to worry about losing their life savings playing the game (the only money lost is the $20 spent on the game), the true fun of gambling comes from the belief that you could win lots and lots of money. Despite the fact that there is some pleasure in winning thousands of dollars in the game, it can't compare to the real thing.   Graphics The stuff looks authentic, but the visuals are very bland on the whole. It has low-resolution backgrounds, and pretty much nothing at all to get excited about. The developers should've done more to make use of the Caesars Palace license and given the game a little more flare -- with possibly an accurate 3D representation of parts of the real casinos in the building.   Sound It's hard to knock the game in this area because everything sounds just like you're in a real casino. Then again, the music is boring and completely uninspiring.  This was a really hard game to review. It pretty much does everything it intends to do, so one can't really knock it much for that. However, on the whole scheme of things, there are probably a few hundred other games that I would rather play that are currently available on PlayStation. If these casino games are your cup of tea -- then, by all means, check this game out.", "date": "Jul 8, 2000"}
