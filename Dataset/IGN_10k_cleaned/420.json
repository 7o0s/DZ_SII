This version has nothing to do with the console editions, being tailored to utilize what the handheld system is capable of. Still, when all is said and done Toy Story 2 is simply another bland me-too action game on the Game Boy Color. Features Eight levels. Password system to save progress  Game Boy Color only.  The movie hasn't hit the theaters as of this writing, so I'll be hardpressed to come out and say it follows the plot  but I doubt it. I mean, the little squeakie aliens and the neurotic Rex are actually out to do you harm. That doesn't exactly sound like it was ripped out of the movie...  The Game Boy Color rendition of Toy Story 2 is, surprise-surprise, a side-scrolling platform. You assume the role of the Galactic Hero Buzz Lightyear, out to rescue Woody from falling out the window and being snatched away by a collector. So you have to work your way from bedroom to living room to street to toy store, collecting coins and performing tasks necessary to complete the level. Most of the game is very routine stuff like climbing ledges and jumping over obstacles, but there are clever little flying elements ripped out of the first movie  stand at the top of a Matchbox track and you'll zoom through a loop and sail through the air, reaching previously unreachable parts of a level.  The one simple thing about this game that brings down the fun factor is simple: the controls. Granted, you can't do much with only two action buttons, but it's obvious Tiertex wanted three. Buzz can shoot from his lasercannon, jump, and run. The jump button is also the run button, which makes jumping while walking impossible. To jump at an angle you have to stop, hit the button, and move the pad in the direction while you're in the air. This makes jumping over quickly moving objects, like pieces of paper or rolling trashcans next to impossible to time. It's this element that makes the title feel sloppy and untested.   The game is challenging in its own right  you can access special levels if you collect all the coins in a certain level. This will award you a special ticket to the bonus rounds. Some coins are a lot harder to reach than others, so it's a real challenge to get 'em all. Still, this element doesn't make the game unique, and there's nothing here that hasn't been done in a Game Boy platformer already.  There are way too many uninteresting side-scrolling games on the Game Boy Color system, and Toy Story 2 joins those ranks. The only reason to pick up this game is for the license itself, and even then I wouldn't recommend this game over other, better platformers like Super Mario Bros. DX and Tarzan. The game built inside this cartridge isn't special, or unique -- it's just routine and bland.", "date": "Nov 18, 1999"}
