On a recent trip to Vegas, we encountered a line of suede-jacket, slicked-back hipsters hanging outside poker rooms at the Palms. We may have even vomited a little in our own mouths at the sight. Thankfully, handsets offer a way to enjoy the game without having to sit down with a table full of me-toos with cigars bigger than Al Capone's neck. And the latest poker-themed release is Sorrent's 5-Card Draw Multiplayer.   Features:   Play against human opponents  Traditional 5-card draw rules   5-Card Draw Multiplayer is the latest of Sorrent's online Mobile Persona games that allows you to play against other carbon-based lifeforms with your handset. We tried it with boxing and racing before, but it is an absolute natural fit for poker.   Hone your game with practice mode if you're not familiar with basic 5-card draw rules. It's a simple game, though. Each player receives five cards, bets, chooses to throw away cards to make a better hand, and then keeps on throwing down money until the latest player has been called. Is it a sexy as Texas Hold 'Em, the Big Thing in poker right now? No, but its a very fun game nonetheless, and 5-Card Draw Multiplayer does an excellent job recreating the game on a phone.   Now, the single-player game is fine, but let's face it, it's hardly nuanced. The game moves quickly and the computer likely wins way more than it should. But it's a good way to acquaint yourself with the rules before wading online and sitting down with human players.   When you register your Mobile Persona with 5-Card Draw Multiplayer, you're given a set amount of cash to play with. If you run out fo cash, that's it. No trip to the bank, no miracle payday to get you back in the game. You're done and you must create a new character to play again. It sounds like a total pain, but it lends itself to the immediacy of the game. In real life, you're done when the money's gone. Unless you want to get into some dude for 15 large, and then you better avoid the alleyway on the way back to your car.   In the multiplayer game, there really is a value placed on bluffing or playing conservatively you just don't find in the single-player game. People fall for tricks. Unfortunately, you cannot search another player's face for ~tells,~ but at least you know you can still mess with some cat in Topeka by raising him well beyond his means.   5-Card Draw Multiplayer is a solid-looking title. We played in on the LG7000 and a on Sprint handset previously. Naturally, the 7000 looks nice. The background is all casino and the other players are sitting across from you with reptilian stares. There is little audio, save for a couple sounds associated with in-game actions and an opening jingle.If you're all about poker, then 5-Card Draw Multiplayer is likely the game for you. However, only buy in if you can go multiplayer with your plan. Playing against the computer is frustrating in that there is no rhyme or reason to its moves -- other than it's repeated winning streaks with ridiculous hands. A full house followed by a straight? Please. You're lucky if you get two pair.But with Mobile Persona, 5-Card Draw Multiplayer transforms into an addictive game that will likely keep your interest for weeks. There's nothing like playing against another person, taking him for all he's worth, and watching him back away from the table in shame.", "date": "Sep 23, 2004"}
