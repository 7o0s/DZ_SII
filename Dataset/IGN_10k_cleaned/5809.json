On the Nintendo DS, GoldenEye: Rogue Agent is master of the domain if only because of the lack of any competition in the genre. Other than the basic Metroid Prime Hunters demo that came packaged with the first round of Nintendo DS units, the handheld's been lacking in the FPS genre, and Electronic Arts is there to fill the void. The final product is a valiant effort, but it really does have a distinct ~We need to rush this to market NOW!!!~ feel from start to finish. It's certainly fun for what it is, but the loose ends and overall lack of polish are too obvious to ignore.    GoldenEye: Rogue Agent is a James Bond game in license only. The storyline weaves through situations featuring familiar characters such as Dr. No, Goldfinger, Pussy Galore, Odd Job, and others, but Bond is nowhere to be seen. That's because you're playing as an agent dismissed from the MI4 agency, now buddied up with Goldfinger to assist in this evil mastermind's feud with Dr. No. Whether the plot was successful on the console, it's completely forgettable on the Nintendo DS version because of the poor storytelling through lame text cutscenes and talking heads.   All you really need to know is that you're a gun wielding badass in a variety of situations that require lots and lots of firepower. This is a first-person shooter at its most basic: shoot bad guy, pick up weapon, repeat. There are layers stacked upon this idea, most notably the ability to put a weapon in both hands; players can pick up a gun in either the right or left hand, and with two weapons in possession players can fire them independently. Of course, some weapons, such as scoping guns or enormous missile launchers need the use of both hands, so you'll have to choose whether you want the impressive spray of dual Uzi-type machineguns, or the massive one-shot wonder of the two-handed Longbow. It's an important choice, since you can only carry weapons in-hand. In other words, there's no stockpiling a bunch of guns for later use.   The game features a variety of control similar to the demo of Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt. But even with the choice, there's really only one way to play GoldenEye: Rogue Agent: using the touch-screen for directional look. The DS system's lower screen almost perfectly mirrors a ~mouse~ control of the PC, and gives players much more precision in their aiming than console analog sticks could ever dream of pulling off. Players can use the stylus, but the problem comes from the dual-wielding game mechanic: with one hand wrapped around the stylus, it makes it next to impossible to hit one of the shoulder buttons properly. The designers fix this issue by providing a touch-screen command that puts either one or both weapons on a single fire button. It's a decent compromise, but really, the true way of playing Rogue Agent is using the thumb strap provided in every Nintendo DS box. The thumb control frees up the hand's other fingers and enables players to hit both trigger buttons for independent weapon control. This game does a great job showing that first-person shooters belong on the DS.        But the decent touch screen control can't save the entire Rogue Agent production. It's fun on a basic level with action that's enjoyable in a straightforward king of way. But there are so many little issues that add up to a sloppy final product. Enemy sprites, for example, don't react visually when being shot, making it incredibly difficult to tell if your guns are actually doing any damage to these guys. Players have the ability to drop down low in order to hide behind objects, but this feature was poorly handled because enemy fire frequently passes through the objects that you're supposedly able to use as cover. Even some walls are non-existent to weapon fire, so in some cases you'll get hit by enemies in other rooms. And you can do the same to them. The special ~GoldenEye~ abilities really don't come into play as much as they could have, but perhaps it's a good thing considering how inaccessible they are on the touch screen control -- good luck hitting those buttons all tightly tucked away at the top of the screen.    At the very least, the actual graphic engine holds its own pretty well throughout this action, maintaining at least 30 frames per second for nearly the entire experience. The engine allows for some decent level designs and special effects, but visually it's really only middle-of-the-road in quality. The game does lack variety in many places, most notably in enemy design. More specifically, the game repeats the same enemies over and over and over, only offering a half a dozen different bad guys to blast. And these character's animations are extremely basic with rigid motions, so you'll see the same clunky weapon-reloading and death sequences over and over again.   The audio engine, however, is absolutely dreadful. Whatever the reasoning, the designers put very little focus in providing a decent aural experience in GoldenEye: Rogue Agent. Digitized gun fire, enemy grunts and groans, and the very little speech in the game have been recorded in low bitrate quality, but this is nothing compared to the actual background music used in the action. It's beyond words just how bad this game sounds, which is why it's a good thing that players have the option of dropping the volume of the game's soundtrack.   GoldenEye: Rogue Agent on the DS does have a decent multiplayer focus, enabling as many as eight players to hit the arena. Only one copy of the game is required for a taste-test session, but to take part in everything Rogue Agent has to offer, everybody needs a cartridge per system. The game doesn't offer anything special to network games with only two players in the arena, which is unfortunate since many of the game's maps are so massive that it's tough to find the other person before time runs out. If you don't have anyone to play there's always the Virtual Training mode that's similar to multiplayer but with bots. But this mode can't compare to wireless multiplayer because the enemy AI behavior is absolutely nothing like playing human opponents. Computer controlled enemies literally stop in their tracks to reload, for example, something a decent human opponent would never do.  GoldenEye: Rogue Agent has the luxury of being the first FPS title on the Nintendo DS, but it's clear that sacrifices to the game's production were made to get it there. On the surface it's a good, fun, action shooter, but the game lacks an extra layer or two of polish to tighten up the production. It's better than most, if not all of the first-person shooters on the Game Boy Advance due to the better technology and touch-screen control, but with the added capabilities comes higher standards. And it's pretty clear that, as fun as the game is, Rogue Agent needed a bit more time in development to really shine on the Nintendo DS.", "date": "Jun 13, 2005"}
