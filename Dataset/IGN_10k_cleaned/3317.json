The strategy genre is where you usually find examples of the phenomenon -- I doubt many gamers had much fun with StarCraft on the Nintendo 64, for instance.  In other cases, though, it's possible to make a PC game work with the more limited interface and occasionally more limited graphical capabilities of a console.  There have been action games, RPGs, and even first-person shooters whose creators have successfully translated them to the console format and allowed a wider range of players to enjoy them.  It's comparatively rare to see a case where a game is intentionally shot dead in the process of conversion, but that is what has happened in the case of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon.  The port is a clear success graphically, with decent visual quality and framerate in comparison to the PC original, but its team combat system, the centerpiece of all of Red Storm's military simulations, has been thoroughly hamstrung.  The PS2 version of Ghost Recon is still playable, in a sense, but it offers very little of what made the original version compelling in comparison to more action-oriented first-person shooters.    Gameplay Ghost Recon is a first-person game of small-unit infantry combat.  It's not a counterterrorism simulation like Rainbow Six -- it takes place mainly outdoors, in open areas, rather than the claustrophobic interiors of Red Storm's earlier games.  Thus, it places a greater emphasis on stealth, camouflage, and striking from a distance, rather than meticulous pre-mission planning and short-range shootouts.  The player controls two teams of soldiers, outfitting them before the mission and guiding them through to its successful completion.  It's possible to take immediate control of one soldier at any given time, but others can be controlled indirectly through the navigation sub-menus, which offer simple controls for setting an AI team's movement routes and actions along the way.    Players of the PC version may smell a rat at this point.  ~Two teams?~ they might ask.  Yes, eight soldiers, divided up into only two teams.  The PC version, in comparison, offered control of three fireteams.  This may seem like a relatively minor change, but in fact it throws a massive wrench into mission planning and execution.  In the PC game, the usual strategy is to have two general-purpose teams and one specialist team -- a sniper or demolitionist.  The two teams of shooters can work together in a firefight, while the specialist can work alone at his particular thing.  That's especially useful in the sniper's case, since they work best alone and under cover.  In the PS2 game, by comparison, a specialist has to be saddled with a team full of potentially useless fellows, or the player has to go into battle with only four general-purpose troops.  According to the Ubi Soft representative I questioned regarding this issue, ~managing more than 2 teams was discovered to be difficult for many console users.~  I don't know about you, but I get the distinct impression that someone is insulting my intelligence.  What's so dreadfully hard about controlling three teams as opposed to two, even with the console interface?  It would have made the navigation menus a little smaller and harder to read, but that's the only disadvantage I can think of off the top of my head.  The PS2 version has also undergone a substantial redesign of the in-game graphical user interface.  There's now a more detailed radar, which points out the exact location of nearby enemies rather than their general direction, and enhanced zoom options for all weapons, not just the sniper rifle.  The zoom is smooth and continuous, without the graduations implemented in the PC version's sniper rifles.  This, unfortunately, takes much of the challenge out of the game, unless you turn it up to the highest difficulty level -- that one throws the balance too far in the other direction by offering no radar at all.  On the default difficulty level, the radar usually shows every enemy before they have a chance to react, and the super-zoom feature makes every troop a sniper, allowing them to easily strike from a distance with standard weapons.    It's even possible to kill enemies you can't see -- just spot where they are on the radar, zoom all the way in, and move the crosshairs over the bush they're hiding behind.  The crosshairs turn red when an enemy is in the sights, and then it's just a matter of pulling the trigger.  This kills what I thought was one of Ghost Recon's most impressive qualities, its realistic re-creation of the effect of camouflage.  Now, instead of looking around for the slightest movement and keeping under cover, it's only necessary to keep your eyes trained on the radar.  I already thought the PC version of Ghost Recon was a bit too much of a turkey shoot -- the sniper rifles and the silenced MP5 gave an awful lot of power to an individual soldier.  The PS2 version, however, leaves those complaints in the shade.  Taking away the game's challenge and emphasis on teamwork have left it a shell of what its creators originally conceived.  Graphics But at least it doesn't look so bad.  The PC version wasn't a stunner in the graphics department, so this port doesn't have a lot of trouble measuring up.  The PS2 version has a perfectly acceptable framerate, and while it's suffered a bit of a drop in resolution and texture quality in the transition from the PC, it still looks good enough in comparison.  The relatively simple weather effects are also retained -- rain in some missions, snow in others, and that ever-present fog from that one really nasty swamp mission.  The character models were always very simple, but they animate very nicely as usual, particularly when you put a rifle round in their head from 300 yards out.  Still a very satisfying feeling, that.  Sound Red Storm's solid sound design also carries over to the console version.  The orchestral soundtrack is a treat in between missions, while the in-mission soundtrack eschews music for a well-crafted set of natural sounds.  The wind in the trees and the occasional cry of a bird help enhance the sense of isolation in a wide-open environment -- that quiet makes the crack of a gunshot even more of a surprise.  In other situations, there's considerable detail put into simple sounds.  For example, while running, you hear all the little rustles and clinks of a soldier with a full kit layered together.  The tanks are another highlight, mixing squeaky gears, the engine rumble, and crunching treads all together. Some reactions to the PS2 version have focused on the lack of online play -- myself, I consider that a pretty minor point.  I found the PC version's single-player game more than enough value for the money, and the PS2 version provides the Desert Siege expansion campaign along with all of those missions.  There's also a substantial archive of DVD-style extras covering the making of the game -- dedicated Red Storm fans might actually want to grab the PS2 version just to get those, if it drops down to a budget price any time soon.Nevertheless, all that along with fine graphics and sound can't quite make up for a game that's lost its soul.  Sure, this game might be more accessible now, if you define ~accessible~ as ~easily mastered by the severely brain-damaged.~  But it's missing the challenge and complexity that made Ghost Recon an interesting alternative to action-oriented FPS games, which leaves it with very little to merit a purchase.", "date": "Dec 10, 2002"}
