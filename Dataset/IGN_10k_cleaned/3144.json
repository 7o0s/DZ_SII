That makes it easy to review them in comparison to other, similar games.  We know what a good RPG is, for example, because we've played plenty of good and bad RPGs in the past and know what qualities make up the one or the other.  Though many games do something new and unique, they usually do it in the context of an established genre (a new combat system in a traditional RPG, say) so it's not so hard to pick out and evaluate those particular features.  Robot Alchemical Drive is one of those games that slips through the cracks, because it belongs to no established genre.  Unless you consider 3D dual-analog remote-control giant robot single combat an established genre, and generally it takes more than two games from the same developer for a genre to become established.  The only game to which it could be compared is Remote Control Dandy, and that, of course, was the last game by RAD's creators.  It's definitely an improvement on its predecessor, but the jury is out on whether this concept is a good idea to begin with.  From my perspective, while RAD could definitely use some work when it comes to presentation and mission design, there's a good game at its core.  Big robots smashing stuff never fail to entertain, but this game occasionally seems to forget that, burying the combat -- the good part -- under layers of seemingly pointless exposition and time-filling.  Get past that and there's some quirky fun to be had.  Gameplay RAD places you at the controls of a Meganite, another in the endless string of synonyms for ~big robot smashy thing.~  The Meganite, of course, is humanity's last line of defense against the invasion of the Volgara, another in the endless string of synonyms for ~big ugly alien smashy thing.~  The hook is that you don't have direct control -- the Meganite has no cockpit as such.  Instead, the hero drives the Meganite by remote control, using a control device remarkably similar in design to a PlayStation Dual Shock.  The game has two control schemes, one simple and one more complex.  The latter is much more interesting, since it gives independent control over the two legs and some other more flexible attack features.  The analog sticks control each arm, and there are several different motions (half-circles, quarter-circles, and so on) to perform different punches.  Special attacks vary from Meganite to Meganite -- there are three, selectable only at the beginning of the Story Mode campaign -- providing different ranged attacks and close combat upgrades as they're gradually introduced from mission to mission.  Combat is certainly strange at first, especially when adjusting to the game's unusual perspective.  The hero and the Meganite are independently controllable -- the Select button alternates between the two.  When controlling the Meganite, the action is presented from a hero's-eye-view, so it's often necessary to move the hero around in order to get a better view of things.  Of course, the best view may be from a spot where the hero is vulnerable to damage (lot of shrapnel flying around when you've got giant robots throwing down) so it's tricky to balance control of the two characters and keep both of them alive.  For ultimate authenticity, of course, the hero can fly up with their gravity boots and perch on the Meganite's shoulder (a la Giant Robo), providing a sort of near-first-person view.      In those situations when the perspective issue is taken care of, slugging it out is great fun.  The pace of the game is relatively slow, but the controls are more than intuitive enough, and the style of the action in keeping with the classic Mazinger/Ultraman school of big-robot combat.  The array of available attacks rapidly expands from a slim basic repertoire, offering all the favorites -- missiles, zap-beams, drill attachments, flamethrowers, all the classics.  Two of the Meganites have transformation options for better mobility, and the other has the keen ~Volcanic Mode~ to beef up its offensive power, providing even more options on offense.  Where the game design could use a little tuning is the mission progression.  The combat in RAD is the fun part.  Running around from place to place on city maps is not fun (especially thanks to periods of lag in the hotspot detection), nor is watching expository news broadcasts, nor is sitting through tutorials that comprise an entire ~mission,~ load time bookends and all.  There's no reason to waste the player's time with this kind of dead air when there are giant robots to smash.  The missions tighten up later on in the Story Mode, though, and present more complex objectives besides.  Put a little time into Robot Alchemical Drive and it rewards the effort of getting a handle on its peculiar design -- it's an entertaining action game, and an encouraging sign for the development of a new genre.  Graphics Perhaps you could say that RAD looks as good as it needs to.  The modeling for everything except the Meganites and their opponents is very basic -- while the background architecture is distinctive in style, it's low on detail -- but it's the giant robots that are the stars of the show, and they're spruced up with more detailed textures and lighting effects.  They also obviously received the bulk of the animators' attention.  The heroes move very stiffly in comparison to the robots, and the lighting results in a peculiar impression of their feet failing to touch the ground.  The realtime environment damage is handled well enough, although without the same flair and attention to detail as something like Red Faction II.  The Meganites can walk through more or less anything in the environment, leaving smashed ruins in their wake.  The particle effects and realtime building fragments are somewhat unrefined, but the fog and explosion effects look sharp in comparison.    Sound Advice to the BNN TV network: Fire Mika Bannhara and Tomoe Kawasaki at the earliest available opportunity.  They deliver the news with all the animation and emotion of a Teddy Ruxpin doll, and possess equally endearing personalities.  The voice acting in RAD is pretty uniformly poor.  One wonders whether this was intentional, an attempt to re-create the atmosphere of a bad 70s-vintage movie dub (the same defense frequently trotted out to explain the original Resident Evil), but the fact of the matter is that if it hurts to listen to it, it was not a good idea.  RAD frequently hurts, although I confess to a certain fondness for Dr. Wiltz's goofy German accent.  Other aspects of the audio presentation do a better job of adding to the sentai/tokusatsu atmosphere.  There's plenty of momentous music, decent screaming crowds, and appropriately violent explosions to accent all that pointless destruction.  Likely as not, Mika Bannhara will be nattering over it and ruining the effect, but you cannot, as they say, have everything. I can't tell you whether you'll like Robot Alchemical Drive.  Usually it's easy to say ~if you liked such and such, you'll like this,~ providing a quick and dirty recommendation for a game.  RAD, of course, doesnt work that way, because only a handful of Americans played the finished version of Remote Control Dandy, and that's the only available comparison.I can say that I personally enjoyed the game.  It has more than a few flaws, but the central concept works as both a challenging gameplay concept and an exciting bit of cinematic presentation.  It's a unique alternative to familiar styles of big-robot combat (Virtual-On this most assuredly ain't) and one that open-minded gamers should find engaging.", "date": "Nov 5, 2002"}
