Its PlayStation 2 debut was met with poor reviews and continued the trend of unimpressive showings in what was once one of the most innovative sports franchises of its time.   It was the first franchise to make it onto PlayStation, it was the first to a 3D polygonal engine, it introduced some cool new gameplay features like Total Control Passing and it was one of the marquee titles that helped make PlayStation the sports console of its generation. For whatever reason, the series hasn't been evolving, as it should from year to year, and this lack of innovation has been made even more prominent by the fact that both Tiburon and Visual Concepts have been fine-tuning their franchises to the point of near perfection.   All that said, the company's latest release, NFL GameDay 2002, does look like a step in the right direction. Graphically, it looks like it was actually designed for the PlayStation 2 rather than like a high-resolution PlayStation game. And while the gameplay and AI still has its fair share of problems, there are a lot of great features here that you'll undoubtedly see in future versions of its competitor's products, including the ability to have two-player tackles. It just has a lot of ground to make up before it can compete with the likes of EA Sports' Madden and Sega Sports' 2Kx series.   Gameplay The most important part of any game is obviously its gameplay and this is the area where GameDay needs the most work. It's a lot better than last year's game in this respect, but that's not really saying all that much and the sad truth is that its main competitors have such a large lead right now that it's going to take some monumental leaps forward in order to catch up.   The basic control and feel of the game is about the same as the GameDay series has always been, which means it's a bit faster moving than Madden, but a little slower than NFL 2K2. You can do all of your basic moves like speed bursts, spin moves, dives, hurdles, stiff arms, and jukes when you have the ball and things like tackle/dive, speed burst, jump/deflection, swim move left or right, and forearm shiver on defense. And just like previous GameDay titles, you can do more advanced moves on both sides of the ball like diving over a pile, shoulder charges, high steps, double spins, high tackles, one-handed deflections and so on.   The only real difference in this area is that the execution of moves is a little less responsive than before. In order to successfully pull off a lot of these moves you're going to have to press the button a little earlier than before. It's a bit annoying at first, especially when you find yourself getting tackled without your player doing anything when you know you pressed the button, but it's something that you can easily adjust to once you get used to it.   After some practice, you'll be able to pull off the moves without even thinking about it. And unlike in most other games in the series, the special moves, and the juke in particular, aren't nearly as money as they had been previously. You can still use them to break tackles, but the balance between tackles you break with the moves and ones that you don't is much more down to Earth.   But while the control is fine, GameDay's problems begin to surface once you start getting to more detailed aspects of the game like defensive back logic, offensive line play, general play balance, and computer artificial intelligence.   First of all, it's way too easy to pass the football for major yardage. Even if you're playing the game on the Hall of Fame difficulty, you'll have no problem throwing for 3-400 yards per game once you discover the various money patterns. And to make things worse, it doesn't really matter whether you're playing with a Jay Fiedler or a Kurt Warner. Regardless of the team you're using and the teams you're playing against, you can expect to obliterate Dan Marino's season records for both passing yards and touchdowns without much of a hassle.   The passing also suffers a little by the fact that it only makes use of the four face buttons for passes. It's rare that a quarterback would ever make it to his 5th or 6th look in a real game, but it feels limited in a videogame especially when the other games offer the extra options.   Passes also seem to be on target way too much and defensive backs don't knock down enough passes. Because of this, so many of your completions or incompletions are based solely on whether or not your receiver catches or drops a pass that hits him in his hands. This can be quite frustrating especially when the difficulty progression seems to be tied completely to this and not to defensive back logic or intelligence.   Speaking of this, defensive back logic seems to be another area where the game can use some serious upgrading. When playing a zone defense, the defensive backs don't do a good job of picking up players that cross their zone and whether in zone or man-on-man coverage, they don't always react correctly to the ball when its in the air. Some defensive players will just keep running up field past the receiver when they should see that a pass has been thrown and they seem to go for interceptions in situations where they should instead be going for the big hit.  A lot of these problems can be worked around when you're on defense because it's very easy to take control of your defensive backs when on defense and make a difference on plays. This is actually one of the game's strong points because in most other football games, taking control of a defensive back when the ball is in the air is usually a risky situation because while it gives you the opportunity to get more interceptions and deflections, it also increases your risk of screwing up and giving up the big play.   The timing of the player switch and the control that you have with your defender afterwards seems tuned where you won't find yourself in situations where you take yourself out of a play. Plus, it's not too hard to get your player in position to make a big hit on a receiver as he's catching the ball, so you generally feel a little more active when playing defense instead of always feeling like things are out of your control.   Outside of the above-mentioned problems, the passing game actually has a really nice feel to it. The timing of throwing passes to receivers just before or just as they're making cuts is really good and the Total Control Passing for overthrowing, underthrowing and leading your receivers is once again handled quite well. But, if you're looking for a challenge, you're not going to get it here because there are way too many money patterns to exploit if you mix things up a little.   Whereas the passing game is fun but flawed, the running game is mostly just flawed. My biggest complaint about the running game is that there's absolutely no advanced line play on either side of the ball. There are no stunts or slants on defense and there are no traps or pulls on offensive. Instead, it's all man-on-man blocking and there aren't ever really any realistic holes to follow when running on the inside.   The inside running game seems to be based on a lot of luck because you're usually just screwed if a guy gets through and not screwed if nobody makes it through. You also see some problems with running into the backs of your lineman and getting stuck and your lead blockers, whether a fullback or motion receiver, will often go after the wrong guy leaving you in a situation where no running back would like to be in.   It is possible to get good rushing yards, though. Even on the Hall of Fame setting, you can put up decent numbers in the running game once you've learned to make use of the special moves -- the shoulder charge works quite well. Running the ball just isn't all that much fun.  The lone bright spots with the running game come to play on defense when trying to stop the run. GameDay 2002 is the first football game that I've noticed that features two-person tackles. In most games, once one defender is engaged with the ball carrier, nobody else can affect the play. What's wrong with this is that if you go for a tackle while someone else on your team is in the act of trying to bring down the ball carrier, you'll either just fly past it or bounce off the zone around the two players that are interacting with each other. This can be especially painful because if the ball carrier breaks the tackle, he not only gets past the player he just broke the tackle of, but he also gets past you because you tried to hit him when he was invulnerable to other hits. In this year's GameDay, a second player can actually hit a guy when another player is already trying to tackle him. It makes for a little more realism and allows for gang tackling that has never been apparent in any other football game. It's a great innovation and something that we'll hopefully see implemented in all future football games.   The other bright spot is that the computer will actually run the football against you and can put up some good numbers on you if you're not trying hard to stop it, especially on the Hall of Fame setting. In a lot of football games you can just sit back in a nickel or dime and shut down the run regardless, but this isn't the case here. The computer actually does a nice job of play calling and will mix up the run and pass effectively to keep you off balance. If you stay in a nickel or dime defense, you can expect the offense to gain a nice seven yards a pop on you.   However, while the general play calling is good, the computer does run into problems in some situations. The computer will call timeouts at the right times, whether on defense when trying to stop the clock and get the ball back or on offense in a two-minute drill. But, they don't always call the smartest plays in these situations.   With time running out, I've encountered a few situations where the computer would run the ball, call timeout, run the ball again, call timeout and then finally throw a pass. It's okay to throw in a draw every so often in these situations but the computer shouldn't be doing straightforward run plays that much when there's less than a minute on the clock and they have the whole field to go. It's not nearly as bad as the clock management in NFL 2K2, though, because the computer will call timeouts and won't let time run down when they don't have to.   Another thing I've noticed is that the computer won't call any audibles. So, if you're 100% certain that the computer is going to run the ball, you can take a risk and call something like a field goal block defense to stuff the line and even if the computer has a middle run called, it won't audible to a pass when they see you line up with all your men stacked up front. You're screwed if they do pass the ball, but the CPU quarterback should be smart enough to see this and audible to a quick pass play.  In addition to the AI issues, GameDay also has some odd bugs here and there. They aren't nearly as bad as what was in last year's game, but they're annoying nonetheless. For instance, there was this one play I had where my left guard recovered a fumble and became unable to be tackled. I was able to run him around the entire field and defenders would either just ignore me or try to tackle me and just fall off. Something similar actually happened on a run play where I had the entire right side of the field open to me on a pitch. I probably wouldn't have noticed it but on these types of runs I like to be cocky and run horizontally along the front of the end zone only to head in once the defense closes in on me. Except, after nobody came, I decided to run back and see what was happening and they pretty much ignored that I was there.   Features As far as features are concerned, GameDay 2002 offers pretty much all of the most important ones. In addition to the basic preseason, season, and tournament modes, it has this GM Mode, which is what it's calling its franchise mode. It's limited to one user-controlled team, you can't switch teams during a franchise and it doesn't factor in the expansion Houston Texans and league realignment after the first year, but it's pretty well equipped as far as franchise related features are concerned.   When the off-season begins you're given a quick list of the players that have retired from your team and you can easily scroll through lists of the retired players on all of the teams. What's even cooler is the fact that when doing this you can check out the player cards for each of the retired players that includes his latest attributes and his complete season-by-season career stats for every season he played in the game and the real NFL season in the years leading up to the game.   After this you're treated to a list of Expired Contracts that gives you a chance to resign players or let them go into free agency. This is really limited, though, because you can only choose to accept or deny each player's offer and can't actually negotiate the contracts at all. The only good thing about the setup is that you're given the option to resign all if this is something that you'd rather not think about.  Once you've signed the players you want to sign, you get presented with a Combine chart which is a list of all of the available players in the draft for each position and their pertinent attributes for things like overall rating, 40 yard dash time, height, weight, arm rating, tackle rating and hands. This is just a pre-draft chart and must be used to try and figure out what players you want to go after, so you know whether or not to try and trade up or down in the draft, as you don't have access to all these ratings once the actual draft starts, which is a bit of a problem, in my opinion.  Other than the fact that you don't get these full stats once the draft starts, it's fairly well featured. Before each round you can check out the current draft order and do any player trades if you like. The player trades are really great in that they allow for up to six players/draft choices for each team involved and the draft choices include picks for the first three rounds of the next three rookie drafts and not just the one for the current year. And this isn't only available during the draft, but this is also the case for trades during the regular season.   The one problem with the trade option is that it's a little too easy to get whatever player you want by giving up a lot of mediocre ones for the great player. So, whether the player is Ray Lewis, Marshall Faulk, Peyton Manning or Warren Sapp, it's not too hard to convince his team to part ways with him. You still can't just stack your team with all great players, though, because the salary cap does come into play a lot and since you can't negotiate down contracts at all, you can find yourself paying a crap load for the top players once it comes time to resign them.  The layout of the draft picks during the rookie draft is pretty nice. While you don't have the full combine stats available to you, you are given their overall rating plus a scouting report that tells you a little about the kid's potential. This will tell you things like whether or not he has speed, if he's a good tackler or not and if he has the potential to be a starter. Additionally, when drafting you are shown a nice list of your roster overview at all times with the number of players you have at each position and the number that are required, which is very convenient. You are also shown a list of weaknesses on your team, which can be either a position you don't have enough players for or something like needing a quarter back of a higher caliber than what you have.  After the draft, you can then sign free agents, which is very limited just like the resigning of players in that you can only choose to accept the player's offer, and once the new season starts you are given a single preseason game before you must cut down your roster to the right size and be under the salary cap.   In addition to having a good set of play modes, GameDay also has a great level of presentation as far as menu layout and statistical tracking is concerned. All of the menus are intuitively designed and are very easy to navigate. It's easy to sort the roster menus by position or player attribute and at any time when checking out player attributes, you can check out the player card for any single player in the game that includes a full season-by-season listing of his career stats for all seasons play in the game and in real life before this current NFL season. And unlike Madden 2002 where defensive stats are kept for only like five years, there doesn't seem to be a cut-off limit here.   A lot of the other stat tracking stuff is equally as cool. There are nice in-game stat overlays that pop-up during games that show either the player's current game stats, season stats or full career stats. And the post-game box score is an excellent newspaper style box score that gives you full details about the team and individual player stats for the game. What's even cooler is that you have these box scores available to you for every single game in the current season, regardless of whether or not it's a game your team played in. This is a great feature that I'd like to see in more football titles.   The best of the game's stat-related features is the tracking of career records for rushing yards, passing yards, reception yards, pass touchdowns, receptions, sacks, and interceptions. They not only have the current record holder for each of these stats, but they have the top 20 for each that includes both retired players and ones still in the NFL (some of the retired players are named, others are just a team and # -- it's not too hard to identify most of these if you have a knowledge of football history).   The reason that this is so cool is because it gives an additional incentive to play through multiple seasons of a franchise, especially after you've mastered the AI. It's really rewarding to see your player move up on the all time lists and it can be an added goal to try and break the records and actually see it recorded. Favre fans can see if they can get him to break Marino's yardage and TD records before the computer chooses to call it quits on him and Rice fans can see just how far you can increase his records before he retires. Likewise, it's always cool to create a player from scratch and just see if you can put him into the record books.  This brings us to another one of the game's features, its Create Player option. You can create players for use in any of the available play modes and like GameDay's of the past you can choose to create a player normally or create a Star Player. The normal method lets you give the player a name, fiddle with his appearance and set his attributes for things like 40 yard dash, 60 meter hurdle, shuttle, vertical jump, leg squat, broad jump, bench press, and pass ratings like out route, hook route, awareness (IQ), fly pattern, and post pattern.   Meanwhile the Star Player method lets you base the player's ratings on star players. For instance you can have the arm accuracy of Kurt Warner, Brad Johnson, Peyton Manning, Brett Favre, or Rich Gannon or the Speed of Charles Woodson, Trung Canidate, Champ Bailey, Randy Moss, or Marcus Robinson. You can have the created player start on any team in the game and his salary will be based on how good his overall rating is and the position he plays.   Other features that are worth mentioning are league leaders, Pro Bowl players, year-end MVP awards for both conferences and for offense and defense, a Hall of Fame that showcases players that have retired that have had great careers, and a Coach's Report that shows your career stats as a team including playoff winning percentage, Super Bowl appearances and Super Bowl wins.   Sadly, the game is missing some features that you will find in some competing products. There isn't a custom league or fantasy draft option, there's not a create-a-team option, there's no practice or training modes, and while you can edit the positions for each formation there isn't a general all-purpose offensive and defensive depth chart. Even still, this is a fairly well featured football game.   Graphics The biggest improvement that you'll see going from GameDay 2001 to GameDay 2002 is with the visuals. This actually looks like a football game designed for the PlayStation 2 and not one designed for PlayStation and made high-res for PS2.   The player models are much more detailed. Things like the great looking mesh of the jerseys, the realistic way that the pants look when being pulled over the thigh pads, and stuff like small logos on the jerseys all make for a very authentic looking football players. The player size seems to be a bit on the stocky size, but it looks kind of old-school Madden-ish in a way and is completely acceptable. A few of the player faces seem to be mapped based on the real players and those look good, but most of the players have these generic faces that while superior to the bug eyed freaks of Madden 2001 aren't all that appealing to look at.  The stadium graphics are also extremely detailed and seem to be very accurate as far as how they look compared to their real-life counterparts. It seems as if a lot of attention was put into designing the stadiums to have much of their real-life details and it shows through in the game. When you look at the ends of each stadium, whether during replays or on kickoffs, it looks pretty close to the real thing.   Player animation is kind of hit and miss, though. There are some really great motion captured animations that are really believable, but then the impact of these are lessened by some really poor ones. A lot of the tackles look great, especially the phenomenal two-person tackles, but a lot of the general walking around movement doesn't look good. Once you move a defensive linemen out of his stance he'll just stand and move around like a stiff board and won't get back into either a three-point stance or a standard linebacker stance.   Likewise, there are a lot of animation glitches in the game. When a player is on the ground and gets hit, he won't just stay on the ground and get hit but the two players will instead pop-up into a sort of tackle animation that the guy that was on the ground might break out of. Also, when players go down and are pointing in a certain direction, they can only get up in that direction so if a player falls near the sideline and still has time to get up before a defender gets to him, he'll run out of bounds if he's pointing that direction instead of trying to go up field.   On the plus side, there are a lot of great tackle animations, there are lots of different catch and deflection animations and there are some nice stumble animations include one where the ball carrier will put his free hand down to keep him from falling on the ground and eventually regain balance if he doesn't get hit. It's just that it all would have made a much greater impact if it weren't for the glitches and the bouts of completely stiff and unrealistic animation that you get every so often.   There are 3D polygonal and animated coaches and referees, but they actually don't come up during gameplay but just in-between play cut scenes. The sidelines during gameplay are not populated with polygonal players like they are in both Madden and 2K2. They do have some sprite-based standee type characters, but they're not for players but for various sideline patrons.   Sound The sound in GameDay 2002 is a little better than what we got from last year's game, but only slightly. I'm giving it a slightly lower score, though, because I rated last year's game a little too high in the sound department just because it was something different than the crap announcing and play-by-play of Madden and Summerall, which it's once again better than.   The play-by-play is once again handled by sports legend Dick Enberg and Dan Fouts now does the color. The two do an adequate job of calling the game, but like most sports games, it does get fairly repetitive quickly, especially when playing with the same team. It's better than most, though, but not even in the same league as VC's NFL 2K2.   As far as general sound is concerned, what you get here is pretty average. The crowd noise is good, there's a stadium announcer and there's in-game music between plays, but nothing out of the ordinary. And while the crowd does seem to react to what's going on in the game, it's not really dynamic during plays. It'd be nice if the crowd instantly reacted to big plays or big hits during actual gameplay.NFL GameDay 2001 was undoubtedly an embarrassment for Sony, 989 Sports and Red Zone Interactive. For a game that's generally considered a first-party title, the fact that it looked so bad, contained so many bugs and felt completely unpolished baffled most gamers who couldn't understand why a Sony title would be this way on its own console. The once mighty 989 Sports brand took a big hit and all of the companies involved have been spending the past year trying to gain back some of the respect that it had lost. With the release of NFL GameDay 2002, the 989 Sports brand won't regain the notoriety that it had during its glory days, but it should help its image a little. It's a very good-looking football game and it doesn't feel completely rushed out like last year's version did. The series is definitely on the right track. Nevertheless, it has a long way to go before it can even begin to compete with the likes of EA Sports' Madden and Visual Concepts' 2Kx series. It might be better than the last GameDay, but it still has lots of AI problems, still has a few odd bugs here and there, and just needs to improve in every facet of the game before it can once again compete with the big boys. If you're looking to pick up an NFL football game for your PlayStation 2, you should look to get either Madden NFL 2002 or Sega Sports NFL 2K2. Both of those games are superior to this one.", "date": "Dec 4, 2001"}
