But then again, the game itself is over-the-top in so many ways it somehow seems apt the behind-the-scene story should be so... bloody.   But that's just a wee little backdrop to the real deal. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is the ongoing history of a vampiric dynasty, and it's told with an amazing sense of vision and imagination that's rarely been seen in any game. Every aspect of this game - sound, atmosphere, gameplay, design, and especially the use of language - is saturated with a foreboding dark wrath, intelligence, and plodding, plodding details. The game world (and engine) is so evolved, Raziel, the protagonist, can shift from a spiritual to the material world, while columns, cliffs and the ground under your feet actually alter in shape -- in realtime. Soul Reaver, like Gran Turismo, Final Fantasy VII, and Metal Gear Solid before it, is a complete world, a near-perfect realization of a concept that's never been achieved with such clarity and ambition.  Gameplay OK, those are big words. But this is a big game, one that deserves big descriptions. Soul Reaver starts off with a gorgeous, two-minute long introductory scene that explains just exactly who, what and why you, Raziel, are an ugly, decayed, moth-eaten, former vampire. I won't tell you the whole story here, but let's just say that once Raziel ~evolved~ past his creator Kain, things went south in the worst way possible.   Once you're awakened by ~The Elder~ a mysterious force that feeds souls into the web of destiny, an excellent training session unfolds as Raziel makes his way up to the surface world. What turns this normal training session into such a treat is that it blends seamlessly into the gameplay. As Raziel walks along a path he encounters new areas of challenge, from hovering to fighting to using light and nearby objects to defeat enemies. This clean beginning sets the tone for the rest of the game.  Control The game then becomes a reintroduction to the empire of vampires. It's a dark, eerie wasteland of five clans, scavengers and evil blood-sucking things that all look like they're straight from the best illustrations of hell, only they're fully 3D and ready to fight. In this world, Raziel has many abilities, some innate, and others earned. That's part of the joy of playing through the levels. You not only get to see how your brethren have evolved, and then outwit them, but you continue to earn new abilities and locate new weapons. Raziel can immediately push, pull, lift, and move objects, as well as fight, hover, sneak and run. In battles, he can auto-aim, just like in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and use a battery of different weapons to beat off opponents. It's an amazing idea that's rarely been used, but Raziel can pull torches and spears right off the walls to use in battle. With the torches he can hit the enemies and then light them on fire! With the spears and poles, Raziel smacks the baddies around, but then he skewers them. And it's a real delight to perform this move. Nothing like skewering the bad guys, eh? Each ~death~ is followed by unique animation sequences, and then a disintegration act, in which the body disappears molecule by molecule.   In addition to those fighting moves, Raziel has more, including combo attacks, lunges, dodges, and when he feels really good, he can lift up and throw his enemies! Your half-dead vampire can perform low and high jumps, and use portals - shortcuts - from place to place. And he can also crawl, crouch, block, and feed on humans. Later on in the game, Raziel learns several new abilities, namely crawling up specially textured surfaces, phasing through gates, firing telekinetic projectiles, swimming, and constricting. What are we saying here? Raziel is capable of a lot of movement, a lot of control, and through all of it, he is well articulated and animated.  Planes and Puzzles Balancing out exploration and adventure is what Soul Reaver does best. It's not a fighting hack-n-slash, but it's not Tomb Raider either. It's a seamless blend that takes the best of both worlds. Exploration and puzzle solving make up the bulk of the worlds, but a good amount of tension is added for good measure. This is created by Raziel's ~life meter,~ a strange Dreamcast-like swirl that represents his material-world energy. By constantly seeking energy to refuel this, timeliness and exploration are neatly curtailed. Raziel will never die, a nice touch in the ever-dying world of spinning, dancing mascots and pumped-up broken legged heroes. Since Raziel is already dead (and then some), he only goes back to the beginning again - or - simply replenishes his energy source via healthy souls.   In many cases, using both material and spectral planes solves a large number of puzzles. Suffice it is to say, the levels are huge and promote re-visiting. It's not just that they're big levels, they're deep. In the Cathedral, for instance, players will enter a giant tower that blows them up into the air. There are no loading times here as Raziel endlessly wafts up into the column. In another section, he must find his first brother, Melchahim, and each room he enters has lofty ceilings, deep cellars, and fantastically large moving objects.   The puzzles hang in the middle difficulty range, with a few toughies here and there. Luckily, they aren't of the Tomb Raider 3 type, you know, the kind where you hurl your controller across the room in a fit of rage, spitting on your mom, kicking helpless white bunnies into the neighbor's yard, and twisting your little brother's nipples until they bleed. Nope. Most of them make use of moving objects into right spots. Especially blocks. Lots of blocks. Remember when you were tested as a kid in school and they watched you play with blocks? Well, Crystal Dynamics is testing you again with logic puzzles involving a brickload of blocks. This gets more interesting when block puzzles also involve fighting off bad guys at the same time. In one case, Raziel has to place four blocks into four different slots. That's fine, except when giant spider-bitches constantly block your path. Arrgggg! Still, because Raziel can lift and turn blocks, the puzzles involve exact placement, with each side facing exactly the right way or, it is back to the drawing board.   One big part of Soul Reaver's problem is that it's so organically structured. Yes, that's one of its best aspects, too. But for many, this game is actually too big and puzzle laden, and there are no telltale signposts that say, ~OK, you've finished mission one. Now play level 2, beat the boss and then move on.~ It's refreshing, but youngsters expecting an identifiable structure are going to be upset. Likewise, even casual gamers will find that they've tracked over every inch of wasteland before they have figured out what to do. When gamers fall into the water by accident and get lost in the underground tunnels, they're going to become frustrated, too. It's great the game is big, but for a lot of gamers, more hints and a few more sign posts could have helped.   While I enjoyed switching between the Material and Spectral plane, this aspect is so unique it's going to cause problems. Until they realize they can solve many puzzles by actually switching back and forth, a few headaches are certain to occur. I recommend reading the entire game manual.  Atmosphere What's great about Legacy of Kain, both Blood Omen and Soul Reaver, is the sense of class and seriousness with which the stories are handled. The intro movie for this game is one of the best I have ever watched. It's up there in the lofty heavyweights technically, but it tells the story of Kain so well and so elegantly, with such severity, it's stunning. I'm used to stories in which dragons stealing princesses, Duke Nukem kicks everyone's @ss so that he can have a beer and get laid, and mammals with attitudes saving the world by being smart alecks. With Kain, we are presented with a living, breathing vampiric universe, with it's own story and history to cover every detail. The narrator uses polysyllabic words, the characters all have a brooding mixture of brotherly warmth and hatred toward one another, complicating things in the most literary of ways. It's such a breath of fresh air, I watched the beginning movie about 10 times, and then bought a used version of Blood Omen just to learn about the original story.   As players progress through the game, the pervading sense of evil is enhanced with a wonderful usage of foreboding language, and a sense of doom and decay that's brought to life by gloomy settings, crumbling cities, chilling caverns, and deep, underwater tunnels.   Creating a sense of organic fluidity is the way in which the game is structured. Cut-scenes simply happen in between exploration sessions. They are always surprising. Kain is elevated beyond the rigid gameplay-boss-FMV formula that's so commonly rammed down our throats.  Graphics Without trying to write a novel here, I'll touch upon the most important parts of Soul Reaver's visuals. Everything in Soul Reaver is 3D, polygonal, and texture mapped with excruciating detail and players will notice this instantly upon seeing them. In the five clans, each of which represent a set of missions, all sorts of creatures inhabit the decaying walls. Not all of the character designs are brilliant, but each and every creature is certainly creepy in its own way. The lowly Sluaghs and fledgling vampires are nothing compared to the bosses, Raziel's brothers. All are bizarre and horrific. My favorite is Melchahim. Free use of imagination is used here to truly visualize a horribly beautiful cast of characters.  Technically, this game is a beauty, too. It practically eliminates load times altogether. Raziel can enter from room to room with only a split second of load time. And these aren't little doghouse levels, either. They're massive, tall structures with a variety of textures and shapes. The starting area, where you meet the Elder, is a marvel in and of itself. It breathes with life, the tentacle-like arms undulating and pulsing, and the colors of texture, and light blending together with deep greens and blues. Perhaps what takes the cake in the graphic department, however is how the worlds actually change as Raziel ports from the Material to the Spectral worlds. Rock structures bend into creepy, slumping crags. Blocks protrude out from places you would've have guessed were moveable. Whole structures that resemble a Greek temple, transform into crumbling, crooked dens of waste. The worlds change in ways I never would have imagined. It's truly breath-taking to watch it happen.    Another technical achievement is the level of animations Raziel is capable of. From hovering to swimming, he always appears to move fluidly and naturally. The best animation of him moving is a side-view of him moving blocks.   By being a vampire game, naturally Soul Reaver is dark. Really dark. I recommend turning up the brightness and playing this is a room with no reflection on the TV. While it's good and dark, which adds to the creepiness of the game, sometimes it's so black, making out areas of exploration versus dark, dead-end corners is difficult.   Occasionally, there are camera problems, too. The same kind that any third-person perspective game has. But Soul Reaver's programmers have mostly ironed them all out. Sometimes, you'll get stuck in a corner and you can't see where you are, but the camera is almost always programmed to swing out of those areas and provide you with a view. While there are instances that I was visually lost, more often than not, the camera was doing what it should - which is providing a reasonable angle from which to see and play.   And yes, there are a few unfilled seams in some areas. But given the scope and size of the game, it's forgivable. Sound Finally, the music. The atmospheric soundtrack mixed with tribal beats is perfect for such a dark, brooding game. It's minimal for the most part, but it sets the tone for the deathly adventure on which you depart.   It's funny. I didn't notice the sound that much. Yes, there are all sorts of horrid creaking sounds and dying gags and gulps, but the actual soundtrack blends so well into the overall game that it's difficult to separate it out. That's a good thing, too, because it reconfirms that game's overall completeness.   This just in from our fine marketing department.

It moved me in a way that few games do. I played through most of Blood Omen just to get a better feel for Soul Reaver, but with the exception of the story its delivery, the two aren't even comparable. Soul Reaver is huge and beautiful and a next-generation PlayStation game. Blood Omen was a first generation title that, while cool in 1996, did not stand the test of time. In the end, Soul Reaver is such an ambitious game - and one that achieves nearly everything it sets out to do - that few games come close to it. This game puts Tomb Raider to shame. If you own a PlayStation, you need to buy Soul Reaver.", "date": "Aug 20, 1999"}
