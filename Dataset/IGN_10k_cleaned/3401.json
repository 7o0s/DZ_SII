The first involves reading through this comprehensive review. The second is accomplished by watching our full-fledged video review. It's a bit of IGN introduction and closing with a fat chunk of straight gameplay throughout the middle. None of our ugly faces here. Nope, Stephen Butts and Ivan Sulic just break down the game with a styling audio commentary throughout (the phrases ~future skank~ and ~in concert~ are used eloquently).   Want the movies? Click the links below for parts one and two (a total of about seven minutes of sweetness), just make sure you're an Insider. Want the text and the final score? Keep reading...    Video Review Pt. 1 - 61MB  Video Review Pt. 2 - 62MB   It's not that traditions are a bad thing -- quite the opposite, really. Traditional approaches to game design become traditions simply because they work. Some studios are content just to distill these approaches, making small adjustments here, tweaking a feature or two there. Other studios prefer to take chances by making drastic (and often clumsily unsuccessful) steps in new directions. And that's the real issue -- refinement of standards has to go hand in hand with innovations.   We've just finished playing through Legend's game, Unreal II: The Awakening. It's the latest in Epic's premiere Unreal series and serves as the single player alternative to the recent Unreal Tournament 2003.   In many ways Unreal II is a good example of the advantages and disadvantages of taking a fairly conventional approach. While the title does make some significant breakthroughs these are largely confined to a technical realm and offer little in the way of new gameplay. But even if it is a bit predictable, the title maintains a high level of excitement and focus that more than makes it worth your attention. Why? I'm glad you asked...   One of the most developed (and least hyped) aspects of Unreal II is its story. Although there's a strong following for the original Unreal at this point, the franchise seems to be better defined through its largely story-less multiplayer matches. So it's great that the Legend team (known for putting a premium on such things) have managed to craft an intriguing tale within which to place the action.   The story itself unfolds through scenes on board your ship as you travel from location to location. In between (most) missions you'll have a chance to come back, rest up and learn a bit about the people serving with you. There aren't conversation trees per se. Instead of branching into new directions, the conversation options are all recycled Lazy Susan-style until you've exhausted your source's information. While I appreciate the freedom these sequences provide, I wonder if the story might have been communicated better through non-interactive cutscenes. At least you can walk away from most conversations if you find yourself losing interest.   But it's worth sticking around to hear the non-essential items simply because it starts to flesh out the characters and circumstances a bit more. When the game begins there are plenty of mysteries to clear up among the members of your crew, mysteries that you can only solve by listening to the characters talk about each other. It's apparent early on that the characters all have histories (some of which intersect) that, as they're revealed, actually make you care about the people on your ship.   Ultimately, while the character interactions are deep and sophisticated, the actual types are pretty standard. A group of ragtag, disgraced ex-military misfits who are tasked with tracking down mysterious artifacts of unspeakable power that can be combined to create a world-destroying weapon is pretty predictable sadly. A mysteriously awkward alien pilot, a gruff engineer and a busty and slightly hostile female aren't going to surprise anyone.   Likewise, the fact that you travel to an ice planet, a jungle planet, a lava planet, a mining camp, a research base and the whole buffet of sci-fi locales, makes the game seem more than just a bit artificial. At one point, Geiger-inspired levels could make me drool but I've seen far too many of them in games and movies for it to have an effect on me anymore.   One benefit of this approach is that it lets the artists ride full rein over a wide variety of locales. The environments are all unique and wonderfully detailed. The architecture is remarkable and covers a really wide range of styles. Likewise, the mood and ambience of the levels really helps distinguish one from another.   From a standpoint of puzzles, Unreal II is mercifully light. Taking a more action-oriented approach, they've included just a few basic puzzles for the player to solve. There's not a lot of backtracking involved here and, when you do have to revisit an area, it's usually for a good reason and not some arbitrary whim of the level designer. I really like the fact that the developers have decided to switch up the action. No longer are you just interested in assaulting or infiltrating fortified positions. Occasionally the game asks (read: requires) you to hold back an enemy attack on your own position. At this point, the game's placeable weapons and defenses start to shine.   In terms of AI, Unreal II offers a satisfying challenge. A great many of the alien foes seem content to run right towards you with the odd sidestep here and there to dodge your rockets. The human opponents are a bit more sophisticated taking advantage of any available feature of the terrain to hide from fire and even circle around behind you. Unfortunately most of the levels tend to funnel the action into narrow hallways and corridors so that AI has fewer options.    Friendly AI is a treat. From time to time in your missions, you'll encounter the requisite skittish engineer alongside the self-important researcher. Their behaviors are quite lifelike and actually give you a bit more of an incentive to keep them alive. In the rare cases where they're fated to die regardless of your efforts, you may even beat yourself up a little that you couldn't do more.   The game occasionally offers you the chance to command other friendly forces on the ground. When a few extra marines drop by they'll look to you for leadership. To give them orders you simply have to step up and ~use~ them. This opens a few dialogue options that let you order them to a particular, pre-defined point on the map. It's an interesting system but it presents a slightly unrealistic flaw -- namely that you have to be standing next to someone to get them to do anything. Normally this isn't much of a problem but when an enemy attack comes from an unexpected direction you just won't have time to run out and redistribute the troops stationed at other positions. Perhaps in the future someone will come up with a method of wireless telephony.   Weapon-wise, Unreal II tries to do far too much. With 15 weapons, the team has taken on more than it needs to and offers more than one player could reasonably explore within the space of a single game. Things like machine guns and rocket launchers are too firmly ensconced in the FPS model to completely ignore and the versions in this game are superb. Some of the chancier, less useful weapons like the Shocklance or Aida's pistol either have too narrow a use or merely duplicate the effects of another weapon already in your inventory. And although it's pretty much essential for the game's balance, it seems stupid to me that the Marshal can carry a dozen weapons in to battle but can only find room in his pants for ten sniper rounds. Perhaps I could trade in some of the redundant weapons for an extra clip or two?   As predictable as many of the aspects of the game are, the graphics are still undeniably impressive. The weapon effects are top-notch. To date the standard for flamethrower effects has been Return to Castle Wolfenstein. As good as that effect is, the one in Unreal II is even better. I also like the wonderful smoke effects. Launching a smoke grenade into a crowded room and then blasting the smoke out of the way with a single concussion grenade is a truly transcendent experience.   The only downside is that you'll need a real bear of a machine to run the game properly. Even on a system that exceeds the recommended requirements, we experienced a fair bit of chug, stutter and chop. It's more distracting than crippling but, on machines below the recommended spec, it's a potential obstacle to your full enjoyment of the game.   What did you think of Unreal II: The Awakening?   One final note on performance: The game offers two unique features called ~quick save~ and ~quick load.~ These are lies. Basically what you have here are two hotkeys that don't work any quicker than the regular save and load options accessed from the main menu. Normally this wouldn't even qualify as a gripe (even by my usually vinegary standards) but, given that the load times in this game seem a bit excessive already, the team is really just teasing us with this whole ~quick load~ concept.  There's an expectation in the sink-or-swim arena of PC gaming that average titles just don't cut it. With so much competition, a title really has to perform better than average to be counted as a success. This is particularly true of titles in the action genre, which has seen an unusually high number of breakthrough titles this past year.As a gamer, you have to ask yourself if you'd rather contend with polish and predictability or take a more adventurous route and risk getting burned. Those who are weary of the standard fragfest approach will undoubtedly find much to enjoy in this game -- the graphics and story alone are enough to make the title stand out. But those who have tasted the fruits of last year's development projects may find that Unreal II plays out a bit too predictably.", "date": "Jan 29, 2003"}
