It's a good cause for alarm: did no store have enough faith in the product to purchase copies in significant number? Is it so terrible that the publisher felt that it would get more attention at a single retailer than simply as a normal release? The recent track records show us that ~retailer exclusive~ means ~bad game~: Sneakers for Xbox, The Settlers for Nintendo DS.  Chibi Robo: Park Patrol has ended up as an exclusive release only available for purchase at Wal-Mart. That right there worried me. But you know what? It goes completely against the stigma laid by other exclusive releases: it's actually a good game. Oh, it's got its issues, but none so strong that it should dissuade you from checking out such a cute, clever, and casual Nintendo DS game design.   Chibi-Robo: Park Patrol is, essentially, a continuation of the universe created for the GameCube in ~Chibi-Robo,~ a surprisingly good adventure featuring a four inch tall robot whose world was relegated to a nuclear family's home. When you're four inches tall a single room can be an adventure, and the game's developer, Japanese studio Skip, explored this aspect to an impressive degree in a ~never fail, never die~ experience that made it a sleeper hit for those who stuck with the GameCube to the bitter end.   The Nintendo DS game isn't so much a sequel as it is a spin-off using the lead Chibi-Robo character in an environment that puts to use the D-pad/Touch screen control to good use. Instead of house exploring, you're now in charge of maintaining a rundown park and turning it into something happy for the world to enjoy. Sprouts need water, so squirt some H2O by sliding the stylus up and down and watch them bloom into flowers. White flowers need a bit of music to make them explode seeds to other parts of the park, so get down and funky by dancing with your boom box by spinning a turntable, and make those flowers reproduce. See a hot spot on the ground? Make a digging motion with the stylus using the spoon to scoop up what's buried underneath.   The idea is to acquire Happy Points which can then be converted into power stored back at home. Chibi-Robo runs on Watts, but his world is also ruled by an economy of Watts as wellitems, repairs, custom park features all require Watts to spend, so it's important to keep the Happy Points flowing. Blooming flowers can be cut down and sold across the street - their value's determined by the day's special color, and rare rainbow-colored flowers will bring in a heck of a lot more any day of the week. Of course, the downside: cutting down flowers reduces the number of flowers still in the park, which keeps you from hitting the quota needed to advance the storyline which will open up new items and abilities that Chibi can use.      Chibi-Robo: Park Patrol shares the same ~never fail, never die~ experience as the GameCube game - you may run out of juice but you'll never see a Game Over screen. It's just a slight setback as Happy Points are taken away, and you're brought back to your house to start where you left off. It's a casual game with a clear goal, but it doesn't rush players - though you have to finish everything in a morning-to-night timeframe, there's no penalty for taking many days to accomplish what other gamers can do in a day or two.   Oh, there's certainly ~challenge~ in this casual game - the game revolves around this evil toy robot throwing bad smoglings that'll spoil your park's flowers, so you'll need to take them out using everything and anything that Chibi can wield. These poisonous bad guys don't like water, so inflating them to bursting with your never-ending watering cannon's a good way to take them out, while at the same time sending a nice, healthy spray of water over more ground than your cannon can reach. Or, simply run them over using the acquired vehicles - not quite as rewarding in the game's progression, but certainly much more fun since it's a blast driving all over the place using these bouncy cars. There's also the element of managing your time and efforts: you can certainly explore the town across the street, but that just leaves your park unattended and open to attack from the smoglings, as well as the fact that you're not there to maintain the flower population.     Chibi-Robo: Park Patrol shares a lot of similarities with Animal Crossing: it's a sandbox-style game where you have full customization over your park - you can raise and lower terrain, put in structures and toys, and create paths all over your strip of land. But this can only be accomplished if you harvest the game's resources so you can buy the elements for all of the customization options.  But here's a disappointment: the game has all the ingredients of a Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection-supported game, and yet doesn't even support any sort of multiplayer whatsoever. The setup is there: the story explains that Chibi-Robos all over the world are working on their own parks. But the potential of this is never explored. How cool would it have been to show off your park to other Chibi-Robo players, or visit someone else's park?   The original GameCube game worked really well as a game because it focused on the exploration element - in that game it was all about climbing on tables, under couches, across furniture to discover new things. That sense of exploration is missing a bit in Chibi-Robo: Park Patrol because you really don't go anywhere - it's just your park and the shops across the street. And when you visit the shops, there's no vertical exploration - you can't climb in this game, so all the adventuring happens from ground level.     But just because it doesn't have the same elements as the GameCube game doesn't make Park Patrol a bad game - it's actually a whole lot of fun because there's so much to do and plenty of time to do it. And the reward system keeps the gameplay addictive - you'll really want to increase your flower population just to see what the next quota tier gives your little robot. And even though some of the touch screen control options get a little odd and clunky, it's still a lot of fun tooling around in the various vehicles you earn along the way - bouncing around in an RC car is surprisingly thrilling, made even moreso thanks to the ability to create your own paths and hills in your park.   That doesn't mean the game isn't without its issues. The pacing of the presentation is the absolute pits - you're forced to scroll through the same dialogue over and over and over again, which artificially inflates the playtime. The camera system can also get in the way sometimes, making it difficult to see where you are and where you're heading - it's fixed somewhat with an easy to use ~reset camera~ touch screen button, but the camera should have been tweaked a little better than it was in the final product. And then there are the bugs: the game's riddled with little glitches like flowers refusing to spit seeds after being taunted with a perfect dance, forcing players to waste precious energy to do that same dance a second time. And bad guys tend to disappear into raised land or under bridges, making it difficult to squish 'em like they're meant to be squished.It's surprising that Chibi-Robo: Park Patrol is only going to be available at one retailer, because the game is actually quite good. Not great, but definitely a surprisingly decent experience. It follows up the GameCube original well with an original theme and gameplay elements of its own, and if it wasn't for the sluggish pacing and small glitches hindering the experience it would have easily rated in the 8.0 range. It's definitely worth checking out. Score one for Wal-Mart.", "date": "Oct 3, 2007"}
