You are one of those crazed participants in the running of the bulls celebration in Spain, running like hell down narrow alleys to escape the stampede of a throng of angry man-cows.   Unlike most runners, where a single goring is enough to spoil the holiday, you can actually take a few hits from the bull before going down. While sprinting through the street, you control the left/right movements, avoiding obstacles like holes. Fortunately, you can leap over holes and such.   The street is littered with pick-ups. In a nod to El Sonic, you grab rings as you run. Roses double your score. Invincibility makes you invulnerable to the aggressions of Fernando and his crew of bulls. Some levels scatter five red flags which, when fully collected, unlock a minor matador sim. These are kinda fun, as you get to control the bull rather than the bullfighter.   Running of the Bulls is a total goof. If you fancy yourself a mobile Hemingway and have the desire to man-up, Running of the Bulls is a quirk to be enjoyed. Just watch your back and cancel the subscription before the month is up. Running of the Bulls has the longevity of a slow runner at the real world festival.", "date": "May 11, 2005"}
