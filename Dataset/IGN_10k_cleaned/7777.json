Written by King Solomon, it's a magical tome that holds the power to capture and imprison demons, keeping the world free from their tyranny by trapping them in Zodiac signs. The book was doing its job until some lowlife came along and wrecked things, releasing a plague of monsters onto the planet  now it's up to a young wizard named Dana to go on a quest, retrieve the Key, and save the world.   The release of Solomon's Key on the Virtual Console is a first, and an only. It's the first game to come to the download service from Tecmo, and the only NES title so far that isn't first-party developed. The Tecmo company announced in late August of this year that their support of the Virtual Console would be ~aggressive.~ And seeing that they've managed to become the only non-Nintendo company to get a game on the NES VC roster, it looks like they weren't kidding.          Tecmo fans can certainly look forward to a future of classic titles like Ninja Gaiden, Rygar and Tecmo Bowl. But for now, Solomon's Key takes the spotlight. The game is a true challenge. Dana's quest takes the form of an action/puzzler, a genre that had much greater prominence in the 8-bit era than it does today. The gameplay here is built on blocks.   Dana can generate blocks, and destroy them. Using blocks as shields, staircases and hovering platforms, you have to guide Dana to collect a key in each level. Grabbing the key unlocks the stage-ending door, and making it to and through that portal continues the quest.   There are over 60 levels in Solomon's Key, many of them hidden and most of them incredibly difficult. There are several games showing up in the NES Virtual Console lineup that are shallow and repetitive  Solomon's Key is not one of them. This game has true depth, with hidden items and features that would take hours of dedication to uncover  and did, for the gamers in the '80s who were the first to take that challenge. Solomon's Key was popular enough to warrant a sequel later in the NES life cycle  Fire 'N Ice. It's another fine candidate for VC release, so Tecmo fans, make your presence known here.  The Solomon franchise hasn't been heard from in quite a while  its most recent release was the re-branded GBC port Monster Rancher Explorer, released over six years ago. The unique and challenging combination of platforming and puzzle elements contained inside this Key is something you don't get to see in gaming anymore  that, and the fact that this game is Tecmo's sole representation in the Wii Shop for the time being, makes this download a stand-out among the NES Virtual Console lineup.", "date": "Dec 8, 2006"}
