While I'm convinced that a good simulation can make money, the high level of realism and comprehensive control modeling usually turns off all but a very small number of hardcore gamers, making it a very risky proposition for publishers. And while a game like Iron Warriors certainly enlarges the sim fan's options when shopping for new games, the title's overall inconsistency certainly won't help popularize the genre.  Iron Warriors lets players fight for the Serbs against the Croats in a series of fictional missions set during the 1991-1993 war in Yugoslavia. In addition to driving the 35-year-old Russian T-72 tank, players will also have the chance to drive the T-34 and T-55 tanks and command a variety of other mechanized support forces. Loads of missions and a full-featured editor are included. The game ships with multiplayer but good luck finding someone online to play with. We can only assume that the features work.   The missions have a nice variety, tasking players with seeking out enemy positions, defending installations from attack, escorting civilians through hostile territory and a host of other activities. Though the missions aren't terribly long, the skill, persistence and number of your enemies will often force you to restart a mission again and again before you complete it. (There are no checkpoints here.) While I don't mind being ambushed by an RPG-wielding soldier crouching in the grass, I was a little aggravated at the pinpoint accuracy of some of the anti-tank gun emplacements scattered throughout some of the levels.  The mission briefings are a bit vague as well. Sure, you'll understand the general plan but you'll often be confused by the actual purpose of some of your objectives. The fact that some of your waypoints are labeled ~ambush~ or ~minefield~ definitely helps keep you oriented but it tends to remove some of the surprise. On the plus side, most of the enemies here are very mobile, so you'll spend a lot of time reacting to their movements.  Unfortunately, the game's tutorial and manual do very little to explain the operations of the tank, leaving it up to the player to discover much of it through trial and error. As the saying goes, experience keeps a costly school, and the developers certainly could have made our introduction to the interface and control scheme easier through better documentation.    As complicated as commanding a tank is, the game does a fairly good job of simplifying the overall control scheme while still retaining a sense of complexity. I found it quite easy to manage with the mouse and keyboard but a high-end flight stick definitely makes things much more convenient. The game lets you switch between the three crew-positions in your tank -- driver, gunner and commander. You'll only have direct control over whatever particular area of the tank you're sitting in and will have to rely on the AI to take on the other jobs.  Since the commander's job is largely one of delegation, players who like to get their hands dirty can run pretty much every aspect of the tank by switching between the driver and gunner seats, merely relying on the AI commander to call out targets. Playing solely from the commander's chair is a bit more challenging but the AI is usually pretty good at following your orders. The ~fire at will~ and ~drive to waypoint~ commands are usually sufficient but there are more specific controls for those moments when you'd like to do something tricky. In those cases it's best to take direct charge of the station yourself.      The overall view from each station is an approximation of what a crewmember would actually see if they were sitting in the tank. Some aspects are simplified or abstracted, but you still get a good sense of what it might be like to be inside the real thing. Admittedly, the commander's sight is a little boring but I spent most of my time driving and manning the gun, which show off a lot more action.  You'll find that the game's ballistics modeling is very realistic. Not only do armor slope and thickness factor into a shell's impact on tank, but the shell itself will drop as it flies towards its target. While there's a handy elevation scale on the HUD, players who don't want to worry with adjusting for range and height can simply enable an automatic range adjustment feature where the PC will make all the necessary adjustments to ensure you hit what you're pointing at. It's a bit of a cheat but a welcome one for players who are looking more for action than accuracy.    Though the developers have emphasized realism in a variety of areas, they've definitely missed the boat in a lot of other significant ways. First and most ridiculous, you can actually get your tanks to flip over by driving 30mph over a small hill. Admittedly, at 40+ tons the T-72 is a light tank, but there's no reason it should be able to flip over at such slow speeds. Get it going a little faster and you can pop it up on one tread just by turning too sharply. What the hell?  Likewise, you can sometimes find your treads separated by even the most innocuous obstacles. I even found that the treads would come off while trying to drive over bridges. Luckily the developers have further compromised on the realism by allowing your tank to gradually heal broken treads. Just sit still for a while and your tank will soon be in working order again. Again, what the hell?  Visually, the vehicles are well modeled and the terrain is full of details, but the graphics in Iron Warriors still look a bit dated. It's not that the world isn't well designed; the range of effects here is impressive but they just don't stand up next to the graphics we've seen in other recent games. I particularly appreciate the care that went into the modeling of the vehicles. The rivets and rust stains are nice touches. The overall atmosphere is relatively good as well, especially on the nighttime missions in the cemetery. While all those features point to great art design, the textures are generally cloudy and flat which really detracts from the realism of the game.   The dated graphics are even more aggravating when you discover that the game doesn't even run that well. We're way above the recommended specs for the game and we're still seeing slowdown even when there's very little action on the screen. Whether this is due to a specific leak or a overall weakness in the engine, there's no reason a game that looks like this should run so poorly. There are a variety of options you can adjust to finetune the game's appearance but there are games that both look and run better so I'm not sure why we should have to compromise here.  The sound is satisfying overall. The chunky thud of weapons fire and the clanking reload cues definitely build the excitement of the battle around you. Engine rumble and the way the revs rise and fall as you change gears is also a nice touch. Unfortunately, the music and voice acting are a bit awkward. Voice cues are much too repetitive and, in some cases, completely inappropriate, either because they tell you to slow down when you obviously need to hurry, or because they wait three seconds after you've exploded to tell you that you've been hit.Games like IL-2, MS Flight Sim and Silent Hunter III have shown that you can bring thoroughly convincing, visually attractive and widely popular simulations to the market. While it does have some merits, a mediocre effort like Iron Warriors only serves to reinforce the misconceptions about the genre. Insufficient documentation, an unreliable engine and some obvious gaffs in terms of realism make Iron Warriors a hard sell for the sim fans out there and an unwelcoming introduction for players who are looking to broaden their interests.", "date": "Aug 31, 2006"}
