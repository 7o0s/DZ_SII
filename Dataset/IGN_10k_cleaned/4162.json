As despite the fact that some of the genre's most heralded and inspirational titles enjoyed an early existence on the platform, the last five years or so has seen RTS software flourish on the PC instead -- Leaving set-top boxes languishing about in mediocrity. Though we've managed to experience a couple of moderately entertaining ports of popular PC titles like Warcraft, Command and Conquer, and StarCraft, none could ever live up to their original inspirations; and very few could even come close to feeling as natural or as playable as those did.   What's worse is that most of the RTS games designed specifically for consoles have been generally less interesting than the ports. Last year's Army Men endeavor from 3DO, for instance, tried unsuccessfully to adapt PC control philosophies to the PlayStation 2 controller; while the cross-platform Aliens vs. Predator suffered from terrible artificial intelligence and lackluster mission design. With examples like these, you could see why it seemed almost impossible that we'd ever find another game creditable enough to be mentioned in the same breath as industry legends Herzog Zwei and The Battle for Arrakis -- Because up until now, nothing has come close.   But it seems that all manner of streaks, regardless of whether they're good or bad, eventually come to an end. And in the case of Jaleco's newest effort Goblin Commander: Unleash the Horde, that's news that's long overdue. Spearheaded by former Blizzard Entertainment employees Ron and Chris Millar, Goblin Commander has literally come out of nowhere to become the first legitimate console RTS since Utopia hit the Super Nintendo in 1993. And though it's not without its own list of shortcomings and need for improvement, Unleash the Horde still manages to accomplish something that most games before it have failed to do: be fun. Even if it is more potential than it is execution.    Gameplay  Goblin Commander's principal strength is the fact that Jaleco has taken a much more simplistic approach to the typical RTS setup. Instead of presenting gamers with an overload of different resources to manage, a multitude of structures to build, and an unending wave of armies to train, players are never overwhelmed with a command list or forced to memorize ridiculous button combinations. Instead it's all about simplicity, and the team's biggest accomplishment here is making it all work without becoming too undemanding.   In more direct terms, it's built so that players only need worry about two different resources: money and souls. Further backed up by a primary philosophy that focuses on pure destruction, Unleash the Horde takes only moments to understand and plenty of hours to expose. Using a simple management system, each new unit is created out of a combination of the main elements that can be harvested. But instead of needing to build a new edifice or mine different areas in order to increase those resources, you'll simply need to find the proper structures to help supply your needs (most of the time, though, you'll begin the mission with the correct buildings anyway). In truth, the real strategy here is figuring out how to conquer your enemy with what little resources you have.   To do so, players are given access to five differing clans with unique powers and abilities for each. The Stonekrusher Clan, for example, is all about defense and brute force while the speedy Hellfire squad is ideal for long distance attacks or structure demolition. Unlike most console real-time strategy games, however, no single race seems to have a clear advantage over the other and since they work on an advanced ~rock-paper-scissors-type~ hierarchy, the best and most effective road to victory is finding the smartest combination of them all. Once you throw in the added benefit of utilizing hulking Titan units and turret-based defensive weaponry, the seeds for battle are most definitely planted.    And it's with the battles where Goblin Commander really begins to shine. Limited to only ten units per clan and four clans per map, players will be able to control 40 soldiers at any one time. It may not sound like a lot when compared to PC titles like Cossacks or Total War, but with the relatively smaller maps and more straightforward mission objectives in comparison to those bad boys, it's more than plenty. Luckily controlling them and switching between groups couldn't be more remedial.  Simply hold the left shoulder button and tap the corresponding face key assigned to a particular clan and you can command individual regiments based on their race. Should you want to tell more than one group to go after a particular target, just continue to hold the shoulder button and press the proper button again; just like that you have an entire army with a complete list of orders in only a few clicks. Why don't other console RTS games work this way?   The real kicker, though, is that Goblin Commander also allows you to take control of units individually. Since the leader of your army is represented by a magical sphere, moving over the top of any existing soldier and pressing [Triangle on PS2 or Y on Xbox] automatically possesses them right off the bat; giving players complete and total control over a unit and the camera system. From this position, not only will you be able to manipulate the direction and angle of the map, but you can also perform different sorts of attacks depending on the type of solider that you control. Selecting a giant troll, for instance, permits users to consume other creatures for health, swing a giant mace in a horizontal arc, or bash the ground vertically with its limbs. It's a clever little touch that actually makes it worthwhile to switch between armies and individuals -- especially since you can still order your units to follow an individual using the same control schematic described for groups.    Tying the control scheme altogether are the maps and environments themselves. Differentiated by the usual variation of the elements, each of the campaign and multiplayer maps are very different from each other. While some are broken into parts with checkpoints of sorts, others are more open-ended and allow for multiple methods of attack. The good news is that none of them are straight-ahead diagonal invasion maps (the kind that usually proliferate far too much in typical lower-end RTS titles) and each and every one of them will generally take a different tactic to conquer. In fact, the stages in Goblin Commander are the most interesting and best-designed of their kind to be found on a console in almost a decade -- quite a lofty accomplishment.   For all of its superb mechanical elements, however, there are a number of key areas to be found in Unleash the Horde that keep the game from reaching its true possibilities. The most obvious of which, is probably the lack of any sort of online or system link multiplayer mode. Because as interesting and fun as the included two-person option may be, it can't hold a candle to the benefits of having network capabilities or the opportunity to face off against more than one opponent.   But even if the two-player split-screen option is still enough to appease online-weary consumers, the 12 included environments may not be adequate to hold their interest beyond the campaign mode. Twice as many locations or separate single player skirmishes outside of the campaign probably would have been a better move; or at the very least, some kind of map editor or downloadable content for the Xbox version.   Another small hitch could come in the form of the rather wasted tutorial level in the campaign mode. As helpful and informative as it may be, it may have been better served as a separate mission that didn't involve the storyline so much. Had it been designed that way, it would have allowed new players to skip the beginner's mode entirely. As it is now, they'll have to beat the entire campaign completely before earning the right restart the story mode from any point.    Graphics  Visually speaking, we've definitely seen better examples of processing power than what's found in Unleash the Horde. As despite the game's admittedly cool atmosphere and generic but lovable goblin designs, the washed-out textures and under-detailed character models leave a lot to be desired. But of particular note are the silly limitations put on the camera. Restricted to only the zoom feature when controlling a group of clans, the camera can only be turned or rotated when possessing a single unit; Of course, this provides yet another benefit to controlling an individual rather than a crowd, but there are moments in the heat of battle when twirling the viewpoint to a different perspective would have come in really handy. Especially when your commander has other things he needs to do back at the base (like creating more units).   Other visual issues that are sure to offend more technical graphics hounds, is the fact that widescreen and progressive scan isn't supported at all. There's also a good deal of slowdown and framerate issues that pop up during two-player mode as well, and the more populated single player missions get an occasional hitch as well. To its credit, though, Goblin Commander does boast a hell of a lot of activity on the screen at the same time and there's rarely any pop-up or seaming to speak of (in the Xbox version especially). The nice contrast of colors between characters and environments were quite welcome to boot.   Sound  It doesn't boast the Dolby Pro Logic encoding that most videogames are adopting these days, but Unleash the Horde does provide a good selection of music and cleverly acted dialogue. Spoken in a make-believe manner and subtitled in English, this Golbin Speak adds a good deal of believability to the script and the voice acting (from what we can understand) is pretty well done.   One area that's not so impressive, though, is the audio effects. Powered by only a few distinct weapon sounds and occasional ambient noise, the foley had us reminiscing about the days of Warcraft and its limited vault of various clangs and clatter. And that's not a friendly comparison either.We're sure that you've surmised by now that Goblin Commander isn't without its own big list of flaws. From its unimpressive character models and camera issues to its small set of maps and lack of online play, it's definitely a product with room to grow. On the other side of the coin, however, there are plenty of positive aspects to the game as well. Be it the responsive controls and cleverly-balanced units that catch your fancy or the ability to take control of a single unit in smartly-designed maps that sound more like your speed, it's all a matter of what factors you find most important that will ultimately influence your buying decision.As for us, we're more than happy to except the game's flaws in exchange for a stellar RTS experience. Though it certainly hasn't reached the same level of excellence as its forbearers from the 16-bit era (or matched the complex brilliance of its PC counterparts for that matter), Unleash the Horde is still the best of its kind to hit consoles in a very long time. We remain optimistic that Jaleco will take the ball and run with it to further the series sometime in the future; because with the right tweaks and additions in all the right places it could definitely be big. We'll keep our fingers crossed.", "date": "Nov 11, 2003"}
