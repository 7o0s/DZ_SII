{"name": "MotoGP [2000]", "name_review": "Moto GP", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/25/moto-gp-3", "text": "Of Namco's three launch titles for PlayStation 2 in the States, Moto GP is definitely the least known of the bunch. The System-22-based arcade game that it's based on, which went by the title of 500 GP, saw only a very limited release in Japan and in the eyes of most, it wouldn't have been a surprise if Namco decided to never bring it home. All the same, Namco made the decision to port the game on over to PlayStation 2 and has given it the same out of this world treatment that it gives just about every single one of its arcade to home ports.   Gameplay  Moto GP is an odd little title in that it is a peculiar mix of arcade style racing with plenty of simulation aspects. Regardless of whether you have the Simulation option turned on or off, the way the game handles collisions and wrecks is very arcade-like in that it's actually very difficult to get knocked off your bike by either over steering or colliding with another bike at very high speeds. However, it isn't completely arcade-like, either as properly slowing down for turns and taking correct racing lines are as important in Moto GP as it is in real-life motorcycle racing. The end result is a game that doesn't real have a distinctive feel or aspiration. Even so, it is a very fast-paced racing game that a complete blast to play.     In what's not that big of a surprise, the home version of Moto GP is a much-improved port of the game that was released previously in the arcades. Namco has done a remarkable job in enhancing what was generally considered a fairly bland and uninspiring arcade motorcycle racing game. Even the game's basic arcade mode has seen an enhancement over the game's arcade version by means of the ability to immediately choose from and fully customize any of the game's five authentic Superbike racing circuits: Suzuka, Paul Ricard, Jerez, Donington and Motegi.   The game also includes a season mode that wasn't available in the game that was released in the arcades about two years ago. While a season mode is definitely better than not having one at all, the truth of the matter is that it's not really too deep of a play mode. Players are given the chance to select which racing team that he or she wishes to race for, with a goal of finishing the season at an overall ranking specific for each particular team that has been chosen. If the goals are met, the player can continue the second season with the same team, or just choose to join any one of the game's remaining teams. Only consisting of five races for each year, the season mode can be completed in less than an hour by finishing a grand total of 15 races. There's not really that much to it and there's not much challenge to come out on top of the final year on the game's normal difficulty setting.   Moto GP does have some replay value beyond its lackluster season mode and limited number of racing tracks, as the all-new challenge mode, gives players the ability to unlock over 50 different special goodies by completing specific challenges like getting from Point A to Point B within a certain time limit or finishing first in the Season or Arcade modes on various tracks. The rewards, which come in the form of new teams, bikes and photos, aren't really that rewarding, but they are better than having nothing at all to unlock.   Graphics  If it were not the fact that the game suffers from a lot of interlace flicker, which gives it a very jaggy look, Moto GP would be one of the most visually stunning games available on the system. First of all, the game's draw distance is unbelievable as pop-up is almost completely non-existent no matter how far away an object is in the distance. And even as great as the draw distance is, it might not be as impressive as the overall detail that you are given with the game's wondrous 3D environments.   The backgrounds just have a tremendous amount of detail in them and just about everything that you can see has a very authentic looking appearance, with the most noticeable being the game's breathtaking trees and shrubbery that looks better than what we've seen in any other racing game including Namco's own Ridge Racer V. Even beyond just the trees, the game's 3D environments are littered with plenty of other nice little graphical details including the smoke from fireworks that people are setting off in the crowds, airplanes taking off in the distance, the Michelin man moving around in the wind, and the reflective lighting shining onto the motorcycle from the markers on the curves of the tracks.   And while it might not have anything to do with the play of the game, Namco has put together what are arguably the very best replays that you'll ever see in a racing videogame. By making use of purposely-jittering cameras, a variety of nice little viewpoints, and cool blurring and heat effects, the real-time playbacks of the races could easily be mistaken for authentic television broadcast footage. The only thing that keeps it from being completely perfect is that you'll occasionally notice jerky movements by the bikers as they go into and out of turns.   Sound  What the hell is wrong with the music in this game? How can the awful tunes that I hear coming out of my speakers come from the same developers that created the incredible beats that can be heard in Tekken Tag Tournament or in the Ridge Racer series? There's absolutely nothing positive that can be said about the music in Moto GP as it simply sucks ass. The only saving grace with the audio is that the engine sounds are quite good.  I really had a blast playing through Moto GP and thought that it was a highly enjoyable on the whole. However, there's just not enough game here and the Challenge Mode doesn't really offer enough rewards to keep the player wanting to play more and more. Moto GP is a solid racing game, but it just lacks the long-term play value to really make it a worthwhile purchase. It's definitely worth renting and racing fans owe it to themselves to play it when they can.", "date": "Oct 25, 2000"}
