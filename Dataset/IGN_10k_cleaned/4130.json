His addictive 'hop and dodge' gameplay has entertained adults and kids for years -- especially during math class (thank you TI-83). Puzzles have gotten more complicated, but Frogger's premise has remained very much the same over countless iterations. Last year, Frogger finally got his chance to hop around on current generation consoles with Konami's Frogger Beyond. Although his 3D outing wasn't his best showing, Frogger has decided to try life in the console world once again with Frogger's Adventures: The Rescue.   The Facts  A whole new Frogger adventure  Uses the same old 'Hop and dodge' gameplay  Seven worlds with over 25 levels  Multiplayer Mode for up to four players      Gameplay  Frogger's all grown up. Not only does he have a girlfriend, but he's also the only frog brave enough to embark on a perilous mission through Firefly Swamp (quite the coming of age). He's got to rescue a shipwrecked mechanic so that Firefly Swamp can be restored to its pre-crash, fire and devastation-free self. Along the way, Frogger uncovers a plot by tyrannical lizards to overtake all things frog-ish. You'll have to prove you have the hopping skills to defeat this cold-blooded menace.    The storyline might be a little weak (who needs a story for Frogger?) and aimed at the younger generation, but if it gives you motivation to play through some addictive hopping action then by all means, bring it on. Unfortunately, Frogger trips over his webbed feet. The controls, while admittedly simple, aren't particularly user friendly. You hop along with the D pad (or the analog stick if you're daring). Each time you hit a direction, it's a move -- so to save you from complete frustration (constant dying) you can rotate Frogger with the triggers. Frogger can also jump over a square (to get over gaps and traps), push objects out of the way with his tongue (but they have to have a tongue friendly handle on them), and use his tongue to pull himself over particularly long gaps (again, there has to be a special grapple point).     While not a ton of moves, they do allow The Rescue a few more puzzles than the average Frogger game. There are plenty of enemies to avoid, items to find, and platforms to move, although they don't make finding the goal any harder. The dodge varying bugs, fire, trucks, and other enemies while making sure you don't fall into water (how is it a frog can't swim?), a trap, or other hazard while looking for various collectibles does get pretty addictive. But, your motivation to keep playing isn't necessarily because it's fun, but because you keep dying due to poor control instead of difficult puzzles. It's just isn't intuitive. Control is too slow and jerky. An accidental button press, usually caused by trying to go left from your current position instead of rotating left and then moving, sends you back to the last checkpoint.    Control is especially bad during boss fights (yes The Rescue features boss fights). You're required to kill a monster by dragging blocks or hitting switches while hopping around a grid -- supposedly dodging attacks. Bosses are a neat idea, but when you aren't given enough time to do whatever is required in between attacks -- and if you're facing in the wrong direction when you need to move quickly spells doom, then things stop being fun and start being the opposite.    If you can't stick with the story mode, you can wade through the challenge mode (time attack of the levels you've unlocked) or multiplayer -- which is about as exciting as it sounds. Borrowing from games like Mario Party, Frogger's multiplayer consists of mini-games that are unlocked as you progress through the adventure. One has you racing down a trapped filled path to see who can finish first. Another game sets you on a giant picture of a frog. You've got to flip the panels over by hopping on them so that the picture resembles your character. Or, you can have a thrilling time with a countdown game that has you guessing when an invisible twenty second timer is about to hit zero. Frogger's mini-games are pretty uninspiring and don't generate a whole lot of fun. Although it's nice that they added the feature, you're better off sticking with a dedicated multiplayer title.   Graphics  Frogger's graphics are nothing to get squashed by a car about. The FMV sequences have some nice details that look realistic in the cartoon world. Unfortunately, these touches will succumb to poor art direction -- which makes Frogger and friends look like Fischer Price or Play Mobil figures. In game graphics are also passable, but nothing too spectacular. It looks like the established 3D Frogger, and in that sense it accomplishes its job. Overly simple enemy models are accented by bland textures. Even touches like dust rings kicked up by Frogger's feet are unimpressive since they're always the same perfect circle. Fortunately, Frogger was never a title that was carried by its visuals.     Sound  Each level sports its own themed track of music. Although it doesn't go to the extent of Beyond to include tribal music for the jungle, etc, The Rescue's score contains enough pleasant jingles that adapt to the severity of the situation (boss fights have the required charge) that you won't be ready to mute the sound immediately. The music definitely overshadows the sound effects, but if you listen for them you can hear Frogger's feet flap against the earth and his grunts when he jumps. Enemies also make their own faint squeaking noises, but they're so quiet and repetitive that you don't really notice them. Voice acting is decent, even if the dialogue seems rather flat.  Frogger's Adventure: The Rescue is a rather bland experience. It's not bad, but it's not good either. Some new types of puzzles, like pulling platforms closer to you, adds some more puzzle variation to Frogger, but the puzzles aren't that challenging. Control is also an enemy and is rather unintuitive -- causing several pointless deaths. 3D Frogger still needs to grow up a bit more before it can be a worthwhile experience. If you're a diehard Frogger fan, then you might get a kick from the latest installment -- but every one should definitely rent it before committing the cash.", "date": "Nov 6, 2003"}
