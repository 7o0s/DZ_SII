There are certainly plenty of Mario Baseball, Basketball, Tennis and Golf games to go around, but the Big N's focus on more realistic, non-cartoonish adaptations of sports competitions has only ever been fleeting at best. The launch of the Nintendo 64 kicked off an era in the company's history that changed that, for a time, with titles like Wave Race 64. And as that realistic jetski racer was so well received, it was followed up by an equally realistic take on another extreme sport  1080 Snowboarding.   Now originally released almost 10 full years ago, 1080 made a huge impact on the games industry at the time of its arrival. Because it was the best  the best-looking, best-playing, most satisfying interpretation of snowboarding ever released in video game form. Rivals to the throne have certainly come and surpassed its design in the decade since, but in 1998 1080 was No. 1.   Five different board-carrying characters are available to select when starting off in 1080 Snowboarding, each with his or her own unique skills and weaknesses. Kensuke Kimachi is an all-around pick. Dion Blaster is built for speed. Ricky Winterborn isn't as fast, but is tops at completing tricks. And so on and so forth with the others as well  after you've chosen your rider, you'll also select the board they'll be using (all with their own ratings as well) and their primary stance (either Normal or Goofy), and then it's time to hit the slopes.   1080 Snowboarding's control is compelling right from the start  even just after leaving the starting line for your first race in the game, you'll be able to appreciate the accuracy and overall feel of its design. It really does feel like you're actually carving through these drifts of snow, with the physics and resistance perfectly balanced to simulate real snowboarding exceptionally well. Wave Race 64 impressed gamers of the day with its phenomenal fluidic physics  and what that game did for water, 1080 does for snow.   Not as visually impressive as it once was, but 1080's realistic feel is still right on.  The realism comes with a price, though  1080 is unforgivably challenging to get into. Its handling is tight, perhaps a bit too tight, and as a result it's difficult to immediately get a sense of how to best handle the analog stick and keep your rider upright and healthy. It's easy  before you've passed the learning curve  to over- or under-correct for twists in the tracks, and you might find yourself sledding face-first into a rock wall or tree trunk more than once. Do that too often and you'll fail the race, as a damage meter keeps track of your collisions and wipeouts and won't let you continue if you falter too frequently.   Landing jumps is probably the trickiest technique to first get a grip on, and things then get even more complicated when you add in in-air trick techniques like getting a grip on your board. And spinning, and one-footing, and all the rest  tricks are achieved through mastery of button combinations and analog stick rotation. Get good enough and have enough air time to work with, and you can even accomplish the game's titular three full revolutions in a row.   Another aspect to take into account is the game's clear focus in each of its modes. 1080 offers Match Race, Time Attack and Trick Attack modes in addition to more secondary options that let you take on specialized half-pipe and air-make courses. Match Race is the main event, setting you in a head-to-head downhill race against one computer-controlled opponent. Time Attack has no opponents, only the clock. And Trick Attack isn't about racing at all, really  it's all about how many points you can earn by spinning through the air like a human whirlwind. The clear focus is that if you play any of these modes in an inefficient way  say, for example, pulling off lots of tricks in a Match Race, where they don't really count for anything and just waste your time  then you'll find yourself on the receiving end of the ~You Lose~ screen more often than not.   But even if all of this sounds overly demanding, it's not the kind of overly demanding that makes you want to give up on it all and turn the game off  it's just the right kind of demanding, the kind that makes you want to keep on going and try one more time. Even when you mess up, you can quickly assess where you went wrong and what you need to correct  like bearing left instead of right at that one tree, or forgetting about the fancy stuff and just concentrating on the task at hand. It's tough, but it's addictive. And that's why it still holds up after almost 10 years.1080 Snowboarding is no longer the best-looking, best-playing, most satisfying interpretation of snowboarding ever released in video game form, but it's still incredibly solid and a whole lot of fun even a decade after its original release. Be warned that you won't be able to achieve consistent victory right away if you're new to the 1080 series  the learning curve for getting a proper handle on how to handle your board takes a while. But once you've mastered it, you'll have a blast. 1080's definitely worth its 1000 Wii Point asking price  it's the best classic game released on the Virtual Console so far this year.", "date": "Jan 29, 2008"}
