Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 is a good example of this - there are a handful of new features, but if you already own last year's game there's not really anything new here that makes the update worthy of a purchase for most gamers.   By and large, this is the same Tiger that we've seen for the past couple years. Things like the newer shot meter, three-click system or GamerNet have been delegated to the new generation of consoles, while the PlayStation 2 game is left playing with the same handicap. It's still a fine golf title and if you don't own a copy from recent years or a newer gaming system, it's worthy of a look, but long-time fans will be disappointed in the new additions.   He still has skills, but they haven't improved. Perhaps the biggest overall gameplay change is the Shot Confidence meter. This affects your skills on both an overall and hole-by-hole basis. If you've played a hole before and have done well, your confidence will be a little higher and you'll be more likely to nail a perfect shot. If you've floundered in the past, you'll have to work harder to keep the ball on the fairway and maintain par. If you do happen to perform poorly on a hole, a Training Event for said hole will become available that will allow you to practice and increase your confidence on that hole.   Though it doesn't have a separate meter in this version, there is also a bit of a risk chance involved. The safer your shot is, the higher your confidence will be. If you attempt to drive over or through a tree, over a river or something of this nature, your confidence will go down, thereby making a difficult shot even more tricky.   It's a decent idea, but for the most part it doesn't change the overall game all that much if you play a safe game. As you increase your skills as you normally would, you should expect that your confidence will slowly rise as you get lower and lower scores. However, it can punish you when attempting to take risky shots and make these shots more difficult than they should be, which we don't like.   The other main new addition is the ability to play in the FedExCup Playoffs. Located under the main My Career heading but separate from the regular PGA Tour (meaning that it's a different schedule but your stats and earnings will apply and increase from play), the FedExCup is simply a collection of tournaments that you can play. These consist of The Barclays, Deutsche Bank, the BMW Championship and The Tour Championship (presented by Coca Cola). While it's nice to have extra events like this, you get to play the same courses in other events during the PGA Tour, so they might as well have just been added to your overall calendar.   Can EA pull the franchise out of the bunker? The main gameplay mechanics are largely the same as they have been for the past few years on the PlayStation 2. The golfing still feels great and the overall progression works nicely, with you progressively getting better and better at your game in the ways that you want. If you take more risks at firing off extra-powerful drives, you'll be rewarded with more points to spend increasing your power rating. It's a nice system that keeps you playing just one more round, and then one more round, and then... You get the idea.   We're not fans of the putting system, however. While it's reasonably easy to read the green and set up a decent shot, the Putt Preview ability feels like cheating. After pressing the X button, you're allowed to take full practice shots that don't count until you run out of time. You're given a finite amount of time that has to last you the entire round of golf, but there's enough here that we generally didn't run out until about the 14th or 15th hole without rushing. The result is that you're able to make 70 foot putts without too much of an issue (even at the start), which basically breaks the putting game. You can of course turn it off, but it's on by default and everyone but purists who mess with the difficulty options will have access to it.Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 is a respectable golf title that unfortunately doesn't make any significant improvements over last year's title. The Shot Confidence stuff is a decent idea, but it can punish you when you try risky shots that are already difficult enough, while safe players won't notice much of a difference. The FedExCup Tournament is just an extra set of events on courses you will already golf on in the PGA Tour, so that doesn't add a whole lot. Again, this is largely the same game we saw last year, so while it's certainly a fine golf game, it's not really worthy of a new purchase if you have 07.", "date": "Sep 7, 2007"}
