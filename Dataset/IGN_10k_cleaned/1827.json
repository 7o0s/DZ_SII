And for fans of the company hoping that its latest PS2 hoops title, NBA ShootOut 2001, will change anything, you better start waiting for next year.   The game has all the bare minimal features, with exhibition, season and playoff modes, plus a bare bones create-a-player option and no franchise mode, which is strangely missing from all PS2 basketball games. The statistical tracking and roster management is adequate, but there's nothing here that hasn't already been done before.  Gameplay NBA ShootOut 2001's core problem is that the computer's artificial intelligence is a bit unconvincing and the general player control feels a bit clumsy and awkward because the players appear to be on ice skates rather than running on the surface of the court. Regardless of difficulty level, the computer will often do things like pass up on open looks under the basket or just totally avoid an open lane to the hoop.   The computer-controlled players just don't move that well without the ball unless a specific play is called and are all too often just standing around in a single place not doing much good in the way of helping out on offense. What makes all this even worse is that there seem to be a lot of animation or AI glitches that'll create situations where the CPU with the ball will start shaking uncontrollably in place while being defended until the shot clock expires or there's a violation.   Furthermore, there are some balance issues with general shooting and scoring. If you have a player like Vince Carter or Shaquille O'Neal, with a very high dunk rating, you can almost score at will on any difficulty level. And on the medium and lower levels of difficulty, it's almost too easy to drain three pointers with just about any player that has an average or better outside shot once you get the timing down.   But while this definitely isn't a good thing, it's actually a bit more rewarding than shooting jump shots in NBA Live because there's an actual noticeable rhythm and release point that can be used and because of this, you feel like you're in complete control of whether or not the basket is made. Comparatively, taking jump shots in Live is something that you tend to want to avoid doing because the general shooting percentage is just much too low and can feel completely out of your control.   The game's saving grace is that it's actually an enjoyable arcade-style multiplayer basketball game when the options are appropriately tweaked. The problems with dunks being too easy for good dunkers and three pointers being too easy for good shooters, actually lends itself to some fast-paced and aggressive two-player fun. It's not enough to save the game from its problems, but it's something to keep in mind if this is the kind of thing that you're looking for in a basketball game.  Graphics Much like NCAA Final Four 2001, the game's visuals are a mixed bag of both really good and ridiculously awful. On the good side, ShootOut 2001 sports the best 3D arenas and animated crowds. The arenas are fully articulated and feature detailed rafters and banners and the crowds have a much greater sense of depth to them than you'll find in any other PS2 basketball game.   On the bad side, we have some awkward looking player models where they all look like they have some sort of back problems and are hunched over. It almost looks as if they were given the world's worst pre-game or halftime pep-talk and just feel really down about themselves, thus causing them to constantly look down towards the ground. It's too bad because some of the players actually look much more like their real-life counterparts than you'll see in any other game.   Additionally, while the game moves at a solid 60 frames per second, the animation appears to be a bit choppy because there seems to be a lot of missing transitional frames. Some of the dunk animations are really impressive, but the general player movement during the gameplay and even more so in the replays appears choppy and unrealistic.  Sound The commentary is also a bit mixed, as the general play-by-play can be a bit on the bland side, but the announces will occasionally say something really fresh and new. Otherwise, the sound in the game is pretty much on par with what you're typically presented with in videogame hoops with nothing really noteworthy. The crowds get into the game, but nothing out of the ordinary, and the general sound effects of the ball bouncing on the court or hitting the rim is solid.  Fans of the early NBA ShootOut games on PlayStation hoping to see the series brought back to its early dominance will have to wait at least another year. ShootOut 2001 is an average game of hoops at best and doesn't have much to offer to people looking for a good single-player basketball simulation. It does has some redeeming features as a two-player arcade game, but it's not enough to warrant picking up the title, especially with something like NBA Street on the way to fill that void. NBA Live 2001 and ESPN NBA 2Night both should be picked up before you consider getting this title.", "date": "Mar 7, 2001"}
