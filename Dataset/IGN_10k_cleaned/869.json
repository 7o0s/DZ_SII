Without ambition, we wouldn't have tall buildings. And most of all, without ambition, we wouldn't have Rainbow Six on the Game Boy Color. One of the most original first-person shooters on the PC has been modified for play on the Nintendo handheld thanks to Crawfish, but this is Rainbow Six in name only. The Game Boy Color just can't portray the same tense atmosphere and stealthy gameplay as the PC title. With these elements out of the picture, this version is at most Rainbow Four, maybe four-and-a-half. Features  16 missions and planning stages. Battery backup to save plans and game progress. Night vision goggles and sniper mode. Ony for Game Boy Color   Rainbow is the name of a international taskforce out to stop terrorist activity all over the world. You are in full command of this taskforce. It is your duty to run missions that range from taking out hostile targets to rescuing hostages trapped inside buildings. The game itself has more than 15 missions to play through, and if you're patient enough the game will last you a very, very long time.  In theory it's great to see a company like Crawfish take on something ambitious like a Game Boy Color port of a first-person PC action/strategy game. In practice, though, it just doesn't work. The game tries to simulate every aspect of the elaborate PC game  and in fact, the game features nearly every bit of troop management of the PC design. You can equip each team with nearly a dozen outfits, many different weapons, select which member goes on which team, how many teams will be involved in the mission, and which paths the computer-controlled teams should take. But when it all boils down to it, all of this preparation isn't necessary.  First things first: the surprise aspect is thrown out the window in the overhead perspective. In this perspective, you can see all the ~hiding~ terrorists. They have absolutely zero AI  they won't come running if they hear gunfire, and they'll just sit there until you walk up near them...even if you're in their line of sight. These guys have the aim of Star Wars stormtroopers, so you can go into a room with guns blazing and really not worry about taking a hit. Since the on-screen characters are so small and hard to tell who's a good guy and who's a bad guy, the developers took out ~friendly fire,~ which means you can't accidentally shoot your teammates and hostages. When it all boils down to it, Crawfish has turned the heart-pounding tense gameplay of the PC and abridged it to a slow-paced, complex Ikari Warriors.  All the preparation you make at the beginning of the game is almost a waste of time. I say almost  designating the teams is very important. But mapping out the paths for the computer controlled teammates? Maybe if the interface was a lot faster and more intuitive, it'd be worth it. But as it stands it just takes WAY too much time to tell the computer characters what to do  I'd rather just jump into the team when I need them the most. And what's really funny is the fact that the Game Boy Color game suffers from the same pathing bugs of the PC version  the computer controlled soldiers and hostages will sometimes get stuck in a doorway, with no way of getting them free. You'll lose more soldiers from this bug than them actually getting killed in the line of duty.  Ah, the wonky ESRB rating. On the box, you'll notice an ~E~ slapped there. E stands for ~This game is for Everyone.~ No it's not. This is probably the first Game Boy Color game that's tailored for a much older crowd. It's definitely not for the Pokmon Generation, with all the text, storylines, political situations, and troop micro-management. It's incredibly complex  too much for its own good. This game feels more like a project some designer wanted to take on as a challenge to see if it was possible to make an accurate, portable Rainbow Six. Don't get me wrong  this game obviously wasn't just thrown together. It really looks like a lot of time went into the development. It's just not a lot of fun to play.", "date": "Apr 15, 2000"}
