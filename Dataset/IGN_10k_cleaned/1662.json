Unlike many of the other titles released in the genre over the past few years, such as Spyro: The Dragon for the original PlayStation, Banjo Kazooie for the Nintendo 64 and Ubi Soft's own Rayman 2 for just about every platform imaginable, Donald Duck Goin' Quackers is a pure platform game in every sense and doesn't even try to be an adventure game like any of those aforementioned titles.  Gameplay The gameplay and design is pretty much a straight rip-off of Naughty Dog's Crash Bandicoot series, which means that it's basically a 2D platform game with some 3D elements. Like Crash, the game has a mixture of side-scrolling levels, forward scrolling levels and ones that you move towards the screen. And while you do have some 3D freedom of movement in each of these level types, the general action is simply straight ahead.  The level and enemy designs are also exactly what one would expect from a standard platformer of this type. The layouts of the different levels, whether side-scrolling or forward scrolling, are all fairly simple in design with a basic mixture of obstacle, enemy that wanders around in a pattern, obstacle, enemy, pit, enemy, obstacle, and so on. It's almost as if the game developers were given a Make Your Own Platformer kit and just plugged in Disney-themed characters and background elements.  On the other hand, there are points in the game where you can see that a lot of time and effort was spent on designing and crafting these levels. Specifically, many of the platforming elements that the player will encounter in the lava-based mansion world of the game are brilliantly designed and require the player to not only time jumps well but to also make good use of enemies to get to secret areas of the maps.  Another thing worth mentioning is that the game makes excellent use of the Donald Duck license to give the game some added appeal. Instead of having a simple life bar, when Donald gets hit for the first time, he will go into a very Donald-ish rage where he's invincible for a short time and will destroy any enemy that gets in his way. Hit for a second time before he gets a power-up and he'll die.    Even with all of the nice extra touches and the glimpses into brilliant platforming level design, the game's 20-plus levels just end too fast. The game does have plenty of extra bonus levels and secrets to be found, such as new costumes for Donald to wear, but none of it keeps the game from feeling a bit short and unfulfilling.  Graphics Apparently using some form of the Rayman engine, Donald Duck Goin' Quackers is a surprisingly good-looking videogame on PlayStation 2. The game isn't going to make anyone go out and buy the game or a PlayStation 2 because of its visuals, but there are plenty of things here that just scream ~next-generation console.~  For one, Donald Duck is animated to death and he's constantly jumping around, moving his arms, dancing and just being ridiculous at all times during the game whether you're moving him around or just standing still. Donald is always in motion and his movements are always fluid and well animated. This is also probably the best that Donald has ever looked in a videogame or as part of an animated film.  The backgrounds are also very vibrantly colored and are well detailed. While some of the early environments are a bit boring, they get better as you progress through the game and some of the lava-based levels in the mansion feature some excellent lighting and ambient special effects. It's obviously not pushing the system to its limits, but there's no denying that this can be very pretty games at times.   Sound The music in the game sounds exactly like what you'd expect to hear in a Donald Duck videogame. It has a jungle sounding feel and beat and features a wide range of drums, horns, strings, bells, and whistles. The music is always pretty upbeat and generally keeps the mood of the game on a crucial, yet fun, level.  Where the game's audio really scores high is with its sound effects and voice segments. Donald Duck will yap a lot and he has a wide range of things that he can say during the game, such as ~I love you Daisy~ and he's constantly making all kinds of grunts, quacks and other noises that are associated with Disney's lovable duck. The speech by Donald and the rest of the cast really helps add a lot of character to the game and will definitely appeal to people that consider themselves fans of the characters.    Considering that straightforward platform games are a dying breed and the PlayStation 2 doesn't have any, Donald Duck Goin' Quackers is a welcome addition to the system's already growing library of games. It's not going to blow anyone away with either its graphics or its gameplay, but it has solid, no-frills platform game mechanics that's rarely seen in today's 3D games. It's very reminiscent of the Crash Bandicoot games in control, set-up and style, but on a smaller overall scale. If not for the problems with the camera and minor control issues, this probably would've scored even higher. Nevertheless, it's a very fun game that will definitely appeal to young fans of Donald Duck who will probably be mesmerized by all the wacky character animation and sound bites.", "date": "Dec 19, 2000"}
