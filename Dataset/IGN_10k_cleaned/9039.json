Grab a controller and kiss your thumb goodbye: the gears are back.   ARC System Works returns once again to release another iteration of Guilty Gear, entitled Guilty Gear XX Accent Core. We're tremendous fans of this series and are happy to report that Accent Core definitely doesn't tamper with the winning formula that made previous installments so fantastic. No dramatic (albeit terrible) changes have been made like the flawed, multi-character combat that Isuka attempted, and this title feels very much like a remastered version of the original Guilty Gear XX. In certain ways, that makes this a great game, but in other ways, such a realization is very disappointing; we've been looking forward to the next big Guilty Gear game for quite some time now, and from the looks of things, this isn't it.    Accent Core is almost identical to the previous XX titles, which means you're looking at an insanely fast, complex, 2D fighter centered in a surprisingly story-driven world. Unfortunately though, the main difference between this title and the original Guilty Gear XX is the complete lack of a story mode, which has been removed in favor of a purely combat-focused experience. Just think of Accent Core as a remastered, slightly improved version of the original, and you'll know what kind of title you're looking at.   For those of you who are new to the Guilty Gear world, we can summarize this whole article quite easily: go buy the game. If you don't already own any of the previous entries, and you enjoy 2D fighters, this is one of the finest series being made today. The mechanics are simply top-notch and everything about the game is stylish and well thought out. The only thing you'll be missing out on is the (awesome) story, but you can catch up online or eventually try out one of the older titles. Regardless, one of the best things about Accent Core, just like its predecessors, is the cast of characters. Never has there been a more unique, eccentric, and lovable group of fighters than the individuals of Guilty Gear. Unless you have a deep, writhing hatred for anime-style characters (and some people do), you'll likely find yourself completely obsessed with at least one or two members of the group. Not only are their character designs exquisite, but each character plays very differently and has an absolutely distinct, almost iconic, style. Whether it's the ferocious and powerful techniques of Sol or the quick-draw swordsmanship of Johnny, there's something for everybody.   Old rivals clash. Accent Core is set up very simply. You can square off against a friend, or you can play though Arcade, VS CPU, M.O.M, Survival, or spend time in Training on your own. All these modes have appeared in previous Guilty Gear titles, so there's nothing new there. Arcade mode pits you against ten different opponents, ending with some very, very challenging boss fights, while VS CPU lets you select a character and your opponent for a single, custom-made match. M.O.M and Survival, however, are the ~specialty modes~ of the game, though they're somewhat similar. In M.O.M. (Medal of Millionaire), the more damage you do to your opponent, the more medals they drop for points. You work through a bunch of different opponents and try to get consecutively better medals. On the other hand, Survival just throws foe after foe your way, and increases the difficulty level as you go along. You also face special versions of the characters in this sequence of fights, which generally makes for very interesting matches.     The combat system contains a few additions that set it apart from the original XX and the subsequent iterations. Not only do the characters have a few extra attacks, but all the fighters now have Force Break techniques, which demand even more micromanagement on your part. Force Breaks are like Special Moves, except they consume energy from your Tension Gauge, just like Overdrives do - just not as much. This means that every character now has ~regular techniques,~ Special Moves, Force Breaks, Overdrives and Instant Kills (save a few exceptions here and there). As a result, there are a lot of things to memorize and there's a lot of diversity in the combat. If you know a character very well, you can create some extremely interesting and ridiculous combos, assuming that you fool around in Training for a while and figure things out. Unlike some 3D fighters that list a fighter's combos on their move list, Guilty Gear only indicates actual Special Moves. Linking them together in an almost infinite number of ways is up to you.    One significant disappointment we experienced, though, is one of the two new characters in the game, since she's not actually a new character. Even though most advertisements and game manuals indicate that two never-before-seen characters have been included in this version, one of them already showed up in Isuka - and that's A.B.A. The only new character, as far as we know, is Order Sol, and he's not really a ~new~ person, of course, just a modified version of the Sol we know and love. However, Order Sol is utterly fantastic and makes a great addition to the cast, so we can't complain about that (A.B.A.'s awesome to use too, but we already knew that).   Besides the aforementioned elements, Guilty Gear is just fun to play. The music is phenomenal, and we mean that. This series has one of the best soundtracks out of any fighting game, and most fans can attest to that statement. There are plenty of color schemes for each character, so you'll never get tired of the same outfits, the animations are sweet, and facing the computer is very satisfying. Also, you have the ability to unlock Generations Mode and have different versions of different characters face each other in battle. Very rad. All in all, this is a great fighting game.   Oh Dizzy, why are you so awesome? Unfortunately, this is pretty much the same great game we've been playing for years. All the characters have the same animations, the backgrounds haven't had much of a facelift, and the music tracks haven't even been remixed or changed at all. Besides the few direct changes, this is the same Guilty Gear. So if you're a fan of the series and you've recently played either the original XX or one of its other versions, the minor changes in Accent Core may not validate an entirely new purchase. The choice is ultimately up to you.Accent Core is a proud representative of a terrific series. The character designs alone are worth the money, and luckily for us, everything else in the game is polished and virtually pristine. Playing with someone else who knows the game well is definitely a good time, so don't miss out. And finally, if you like cute anime guys/girls, this game has them in abundance, so it'll please everyone. So what's it gonna' be: Heaven or Hell?", "date": "Sep 14, 2007"}
