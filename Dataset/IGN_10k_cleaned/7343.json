{"name": "Fighter Pilot", "name_review": "Fighter Pilot", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/18/fighter-pilot", "text": "A lot of gamers are understandably intimidated by the complex controls and steep learning curves of realistic jet-combat simulations, so a game like Fighter Pilot would seem to have a ready-made market. But while Fighter Pilot certainly makes it easy for even a rookie to start blasting jets and 'copters out of the sky and smashing ground installations to heaps smoking rubble, it'll leave all but the rawest of rookies with a distinct feeling of emptiness.  A big reason for that is that the action in Fighter Pilot is as generic as the title. The Middle East theater of operations where you fly the game's 24 missions is about as standard as it gets for jet combat  and except for a few snow-covered peaks, the samey-same terrains all start to blend together after only a few sorties. A one-HUD-fits-all interface means that the only way to tell which of the four planes (F/A-18 Hornet, F-117 Stealth fighter, F-22 Raptor, and Su-35 Flanker) you're flying is by checking the weapons loadout and seeing what your mount's max speed is. And while each mission ostensibly has a unique goal, combat is a dreary routine of selecting targets, letting loose a missile or two, moving on to the next one, and repeating the process until it's time to go home.  You start out as rookie who's been selected for some special missions because the brass think you've got a lot of potential  and apparently because some old war-horse named General Mervyn (Mervyn?) served with your Dad and you've got the same call sign as him. The bulk of your air time is spent in destroying terrorist supply bases, convoys, and munitions dumps, but as you work your way through a guided tour of Mideast terrorist hot spots you learn that the really big bad guy is also a hot-shot pilot from way back. Wonder who you'll be facing off against at the end of the game, eh?  Fighter Pilot's dumbed-down controls don't just make it easy for beginners to start tangling with Russian-made fighters; they also make it nearly impossible for anything but good things to happen to you. Sure, I'll admit it's frustrating to take off in an ultra-realistic simulation and find yourself nosing into the ground during as you circle low to the ground, but at least it means that there's a challenge awaiting you the next time you take off. In Fighter Pilot, the only real challenge comes when you've been assigned an absurdly high number of targets  not because they'll pose that much of a threat to you, but because you might get lazy and waste ammunition as you pick off bogies like you're on a high-tech turkey shoot.  Fighter Pilot does dish out some fairly tasty visuals, especially if you take time to check out the nice vapor trails created by SAMs and air-to-air missiles. Let's face it, though  the stuff here isn't so good that you'll see raves about it at the 3dfx Web site, and once you've seen a few explosions and smoke trails you've pretty much experienced the whole tour.  The one factor that might breathe life into an otherwise stagnant product is good multiplayer support, but the only way to round up opponents is by heading to the EA chat room and praying that someone else was lured into buying Fighter Pilot (or, more likely, receiving it as a gift) and that they're logged on at the same time as you. I tried without success several times, and my guess is that the odds of finding someone worth playing against are about as good as a lasting peace coming to the Middle East before the Y2K bug kicks in.  Electronic Arts did achieve at least one goal with Fighter Pilot: they made an air-combat game that anyone could fly. Now if they could make one that folks would want to play for more than three or four hours, they might be on to something big....    -  Chris Buckman", "date": "Mar 18, 1999"}
