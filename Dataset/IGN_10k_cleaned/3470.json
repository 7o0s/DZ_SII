The first time I saw it, I liked the art style, saw some fast paced combat, and figured that Arxel Tribe and Eugen Systems had a good thing going with The Gladiators: Galactic Circus Games. It was a campy little snibbit in the style of Flash Gordon or some other cheesy sci-fi flick of the 70's. While what I saw was pretty bare originally, I figured that having only seen some of the beginning levels, I could expect some pretty fun and interesting things from the final. But now that I've played the game for more than a few hours, I can say that I'm not that impressed. While I still like the art style, the gameplay is just not up to my strategy bar favoring quick decision and heavily scripted levels instead of planning ahead and thinking about your approach.   The Gladiators starts in the 70's on Earth. After discovering the black hole phenomenon, the US government decides to send an astronaut into one of them to check it out. Sounds smart enough and safe enough, right? Wrong! The ~volunteer~ Greg D. Callahan along with his ship and crew get sucked through the thing only to end up on the other side of the galaxy. Upon arrival, a crew of rather unfriendly robot alien creatures kills pretty much everything on the ship except for Callahan. He's the trophy.   Luckily for our wayward hero, a princess with gigantic hair steps in to give him a fighting chance. Apparently, her father just died, leaving a position open as ruler of the empire. As with all good jobs, more than one person wants in. On this side of reality, such quibbles are decided via the most popular form of entertainment, the Deathbowl, a sci-fi equivalent to the Roman gladiatorial competitions a couple thousand years ago. The Deathbowl plays out over a set of games where gladiators battle it out for supremecy in front of throngs of bloodthirsty fans. In this case, three gladiators are chosen. One champion for each contender for the crown, winner takes all. So Callahan is recruited by the princess because apparently nobody else wants to give it a go. Who would want to work for a hot blue princess with tentacle hair? Where's Captain Kirk when you need him...   This story is told via crappy cutscenes and painful voicework both during matches and in between them. While the developers were trying their best for 70's camp and witty dialogue, you get little to none of each delivered in terrible style by the voice actors. I can't remember laughing once through the game. Mostly I remember the headache that the announcer's voice has given me over the last few days. While I normally can appreciate the fun awfulness of B movies, like I'm fairly sure this was shooting for, I found nothing entertaining from a cheesy or quality standpoint. Characters are forgettable and boring with only the barest of personalities.   While the actual game looks pretty good with bright colors and good model work, the cutscenes in between levels suffer from bland environments, camerawork, and the lack of moving mouth parts. When the magical gladiator Fargass stands there with his stupid mouth sagging open with a blank stare on his face while trying to say something irrefutably evil, it just comes across as flat.     But like I said, The Gladiators looks pretty good while playing. The worlds are created with a certain level of detail. All of the units are nicely constructed with colors and textures that hide any imperfections pretty well. Likewise, structures and dense foliage are put together well to create a lush and complex landscape. Effects are  well done with a very actiony, over the top feel. Machine guns give off a ridiculous amount of muzzle fire and laser beams are fat and bright as hell. If nothing else, the game is pretty fun to watch. Its cartoony appeal keeps the intense action a little lighter than it might have otherwise been.   Unfortunately, it lags big if you don't have the RAM and processor to handle it. The minimum specs are a joke. It was virtually a slide show in heavy combat missions running at 800x600x16 on a P4 1.6, 256MB RAM, and a GeForce4 Ti4600. Hard to imagine the crappy little computer the minimum specs would make could even consider running this game well.   When stepping into a mission, you'll also get a look at the wild and ready crowd just waiting for the first explosion of machine parts and blood. It's an interesting concept for these arenas to be constructed just for this event and you do begin to feel as if you're part of some sick little sport. Likewise, the cheering and jeering of the crowd as you play and get into messy fights is pretty fun.   Unfortunately, the gameplay just didn't really do it for me for a number of reasons. As you step into an arena, you're given a meager number of forces. From here, you'll need to move to gather power-up items and joker cards to increase the power and effectiveness of your troops. These power-ups are located throughout the level. They constitute things such as immediate reinforcements, healing, armor, and increase in power. You'll also get the joker cards, which can be used for any one of these power-ups, or for additional units.    With the need to build a base and harvest resources taken out from the picture, the game focuses instead on fast paced tactical combat. There are very few times when you'll just be sitting around building up forces (although that does happen occasionally). Most of the time, you'll be on a pretty linear track through a level. While there are some points in each level that may allow you to choose a path, what you're left with is a game built like the levels in WarCraft and StarCraft where you're running through caverns or a base picking up units as you go. The levels in Gladiators are just as heavily scripted as any of these, making the gameplay pretty straightforward. You'll never be confused about what it is you're supposed to be doing thanks to the mid-mission announcements and waypoints. There are certainly paths that offer less resistance, but chances are you're still going to have to fight whatever enemies you passed up, either because you'll be running back through an area, or because they'll be sent in to attack you from behind after you've reached your goal.    In each of the levels, you'll be trying to capture spawn points that allow you to manufacture more units. So the first goal will be assaulting enemy positions. Every single time you capture one of these, you'll immediately hear that your opponent is sending his troops en-masse to assault your forces.    Around most of the spawn zones are various structures that will help you in your defense. Line of sight and height advantages play a huge part in strategy in Gladiators. The higher your guys are, the better they can see and the farther they can shoot. Unfortunately, it seemed that some of the time, ranged units far below me on the ground would still be able to hit my units sitting on a tower before I could even see them. Yet every time I fired on enemy troops sitting in a tower with my own long range units, they would immediately be found, even if they were sitting in comfortable cover.   After you've successfully defended your new position, demarked by another cut-announcement, you'll need to move on to the next assault, either another spawn zone closer to the final goal or some reward like extra items or units. It continues on like this over and over. While there are a couple of attempts at more original gameplay concepts, they weren't very interesting.   While the overlying concepts and heavily scripted gameplay weren't that great, the terrain and building advantages did make things more interesting. All of the objects in the game can be destroyed. Buildings, trees, scrubs, and wildlife all fell prey to my firing. All of these objects have some sort of advantage to them as well. Most of the structures can be climbed on top of for added height advantage, while terrain like trees and foliage can be used to hide troops. Unfortunately, it also can be used to great advantage on your opponent's side to hide troops. Using scouts to draw enemies out of their hiding places is a must. That's also about as tricky as I ever got. Because the AI is so simple and script based, you aren't going to get any particularly interesting tactics used against you. Enemies just engage and run at you from all sides and eventually you're either going to have to push straight up a hill to wipe out your enemy, or draw them out one at a time with a scout. It's not incredibly complicated, and as I found, more often than not all problems can be solved with heavy rushes to outnumber your enemies, even if some of them have higher ground.      Unfortunately that terrain also creates a problem for moving many troops through each level. Because there are so many enemies hiding in bushes trying to give you fits, you'll often have to move your troops into the forest in order to get a look at them. To do this, you'll want to have an move/attack order so that your units will attack anything along the way, such as the units laying in wait. Yet when you hit A to issue the attack/move order and try to click on the landscape, you'll oftentimes end up clicking on a piece of the landscape and your units will attack it instead of any enemies that might be around. The same can be said for fighting inside of bases. When bringing up a troop of units from the rear and telling them to attack as they go, you'll end up clicking on a building instead of the ground, even if it look as though you're clicking on the ground. It's pretty frustrating, especially when some of your troops are getting pounded and your back-ups are just sitting there trying to blow up some defenseless water silo. Along the same line, there's no way to get your units to stay in formation as they walk, or attacks as they move to get in formation.   Friendly AI is actually pretty good though. A good balance of aggressiveness and defensiveness. There were a few pathfinding issues, especially with bigger units like tanks, but mostly this part of the game is smooth.   Perhaps the biggest problem with the interface is the camera. While it rotates easy enough, it doesn't zoom out nearly far enough for comfortable playing. Controlling air units and managing a large force can be tricky when you can't see enough of the playing field.   More fun than the single player is the multiplayer. Because the artificial intelligence is turned off and you actually have to react to more cunning and quick thinking human players, the game definitely gets more interesting. The style of gameplay elliminates resources gathering downtime and moves straight into fast paced action strategy. There's a lot of carnage in these multiplayer bouts. The matches don't last very long, but they certainly keep you on your toes. Sadly, the mere 8 maps won't satisfy your every need for variety.While The Gladiators: Galactic Circus Games isn't really my piece of pie, those that have been looking for a faster paced real-time strategy game might enjoy it. Serious strategy gamers will probably be a bit disappointed with the heavily scripted AI and fairly linear tracks to success.The lack of presentation polish isn't going to impress anyone, yet the bright graphical style will perk some eyes up a bit. This is a pretty hit and miss title that could have used a professional writer, AI programmer, and a little more thought. The idea of a fast paced quasi-Smash TV type of game is certainly appealing. Maybe a sequel will bring a little more success in those areas.", "date": "Mar 5, 2003"}
