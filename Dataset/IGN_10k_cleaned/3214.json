Developer Rare's GoldenEye came out for Nintendo 64 in 1997 and in the five years since, on more powerful next-generation consoles, competing software houses have still been unable to make a significantly better Bond first-person shooter. Look at publisher Electronic Arts' track record, though, and you'll know that it's not for lack of trying. The company has released several 007 follow-ups, a few of them noteworthy, but none of them good enough to officially dethrone Nintendo's gargantuan success of old.  There's good news though. Eurocom Entertainment, working closely with EA's Need for Speed racing team, has delivered what is easily the best 007 offering in years. James Bond 007: NightFire is spilling with the spy license, from the perfectly realized digital likeness of Pierce Brosnan as Bond to the huge wealth of varied weapons and undeniably secret-agent-worthy locales. It's also got a spot on control, a strong selection of different play styles, from first-person shooter areas to driving levels and more. And yet, it's not perfect, and it's not quite ready to take down GoldenEye. Keep reading to find out why.   Engage in a completely immersive first-person Bond experience featuring diverse gameplay All new, original single-player storyline that builds on the Bond legacy with villains and allies, both new and familiar  Travel through snow, underwater, into castles, through factory warehouses and even to a space station Gameplay is largely first-person shooting with elements of driving and on-rails target missions A full arsenal of Q-lab weapons, gadgets and autos to utilize  Detailed 3D environments and a smooth framerate  Four-person multi-player support GameCube version features CPU bots for multiplayer A wide variety of different multiplayer modes Perfect likeness of Pierce Brosnan for Bond Progressive scan compatible on GameCube, Xbox   Gameplay NightFire, unlike Eurocom's other big project for the year, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, is not based on any particular book or movie. Rather, it takes inspiration from several of the best 007 moments across the years. In the completely original storyline, the super-spy finds himself on the trail of a corrupt businessman who's hatched a plan to use a secret weapon to destroy the world. Bond's quest to stop the terrorist before he can do any harm takes him across the world through a variety of first-person shooter and driving levels, deep into the ocean, and soaring into space. You'll recognize elements from past movies, including one or two familiar faces. The truth is that with so many great locales and scenarios to fully explore, we don't care that this game has nothing to die with the latest Bond movie Die Another Day. As in with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Eurocom has done a commendable job of capitalizing on the license. Everything about the game, from the slick opening video to the FMV cut-scenes and selection of gadgets and guns, screams Bond cool, and there's so much to see and choose from that NightFire is easily the best realization of 007's world yet.  Gameplay is split up into two three categories: first-person shooter areas, which make up most of the title, driving levels, and a couple on-rails stages. The shooting stages are significantly better than the racing and on-rails ones, in our experience, but none of them are poor. Eurocom has done a fine job of balancing action with stealth elements in most of these levels. In the second stage, for instance, Bond must infiltrate a castle located deep in the snowy mountains, and it's up to you to figure out a method to do this, of which there are two: you can simply run directly ahead with guns blazing and take your chances or you can go a sneakier route around the castle and slip in unnoticed.  In later levels, you'll have to devise ways to successfully take out a series of rooftop snipers, to unlock several security systems, to make it to the skyscraper without harming a single innocent guard, and more. It's all good fun, particularly the sniping bouts, and it's broken up brilliantly by objectives that have Bond opting for all sorts of handy gadgets, including his laser, grapple, stunner, micro-camera, night-vision and heat-vision glasses, and more. It's easy to see some of the inspirations in the weapon choices, too, which include everything from a briefcase sentry gun to a weapon that enables you to shoot missiles and them guide them with a camera. Very well done.  Were NightFire strictly a FPS, it would definitely be one of GameCube's better ones.  The FPS levels look beautiful  The driving levels lack the polish of the first-person ones, there's no doubting that, but they're still fun enough too. In these, you'll have to do everything from speeding down snowy roads while ejecting missiles from Bond's V12 Vanquish to taking the car for an underwater romp to the bottom of the ocean and into battle against enemy vehicles and submarines. There are several branching paths in some of these areas, and at times you'll be treated to a satisfying in-game cut-scene as 007's car soars over a chasm and races on. There's a very stylistic 007 appeal to these levels -- they're very much part of the Bond universe, and still we would be glad to sacrifice them for more pure first-person gunplay. There are also stages in which the action unfolds ~on rails,~ or guided by the camera. Here, all you'll have to do is point and shoot. One of the better types of these offerings involves flying around a canyon inside a small plane and blasting at foes. It's mildly entertaining for a bit, but it seems to go on forever and proves to be the least enjoyable of the play types.       NightFire features 12 stages in all, each with sub areas, so the selection is decent, but it's also still one that's likely to be beaten quickly by seasoned FPS players, and that's a consideration. The game can be played on three different difficulties, but there are no new objectives between them, as there are in a game like TimeSplitters 2, or, for that matter, in GoldenEye 007, and that's disappointing, especially since the game falls on the easier side. It probably took us less than 10 hours to whip through the game. To its credit though, we enjoyed it while it lasted.  Whether in first-person shooter play or in racing scenarios, controls seems to follow positively basic configurations, easy to learn and intuitive, if not entirely complex. In the shooter levels, the standard configuration -- the one we recommend -- uses both analog sticks for movement and aim. A button is for actions -- opening doors, activating switches, and reloading 007's weapon, for instance; R shoots, L brings up cross-hair for manual aim, B equips secondary fire, Y jumps and X crouches. It feels very traditional, but it gets the job done. Meanwhile, a host of gadgets and weapons can be accessed easily through the D-Pad. For driving areas, it couldn't possibly be simpler: R accelerates, L brakes, A button shoots weapons and Y changes them. Both work great. You can whip out a sniper rifle, zoom in and shoot down five enemies in a matter of seconds, it's ultra entertaining, and it feels top.   For the most part the FPS stages are brilliant. They're fast, control is almost TimeSplitters 2-like responsive, there's lots to do and loads to see, the objectives are entertaining and challenging, and the enemy AI is respectable. At points, in fact, foes will take cover behind objects, duck and roll out of harm's way, and strafe around while shooting at Bond. There is even a pesky Ninja character that flips and summersaults all about and then rushes 007 with a sword, which is extremely deadly. It's very impressive. But we do have two major gripes: the first is that occasionally when you shoot an enemy, nothing happens. We've put a bullet dead center into an opponent's chest and he didn't even blink. We're not sure if it's a rare collision detection issue or if these enemies are momentarily immortal, but there's something not right with it. Second is the speed of characters in the multiplayer mode, which we'll detail greater momentarily. For some reason or another, you move more slowly than you do in the single-player game -- to the point, in fact, where we sometimes check to see if our character is crouching. It's never bothersome to the point where it ruins the experience, but it is a complaint all the same.  The multiplayer mode rounds out the experience here and save for the issue mentioned above it's a solid one. Eurocom has included a host of modes including everything from standard Arena deathmatch to Team Arena; Capture the Flag, a last man standing of sorts called Top Agent, a bout in which players must retrieve blueprints before the opponent called Industrial Espionage, and more. There is even a mode called 'GoldenEye Strike.' Several of these additions must be unlocked through the single-player mode, which extends replay value. On top of modes, there are at least eight levels to play in, the ability to add up to six AI bots (even in multiplayer), the option to customize bots and set their personality types, and more. It's a very complete package in this sense and on GameCube the action runs, for the most part, at 60 frames per second in four-player mode with lots going on. There are one or two stages in which the fluidity drops, but overall it's nicely done.   Graphics You could probably review the graphic side of NightFire twice, if you wanted to: once for the first-person levels and again for the driving ones. The FPS elements of the game are outstanding. Eurocom has done a brilliant job of creating one of the better 3D engines available on any home console and it shows in full. As you explore the lush 3D worlds in first-person, you'll notice first and foremost how large they are, and then all of the subtle details will begin to make themselves known. In the second level, snow drifts down to the ground as you make your way about the gigantic environment. You can use your sniper rifle to look as far into the distance as they eye can see, with no loss in texture or geometrical detail. As you shoot it out with enemies, they come to life with detailed polygonal models and fluid animation that encompasses all sorts of motion-captured rolls and dives. It looks spectacular. Meanwhile, real-time lighting effects fill temporarily illuminate hallways, and the muzzles of enemy guns even project lighting onto enemy polygon models, which of course looks fabulous and goes a long way in extending the visual atmosphere of the game. What makes it all the more magnificent is that on GameCube everything runs at a rock solid 60 frames per second, which is extremely impressive.  Bond uses the Ronin sentry briefcase -- a cool weapon in the game  The driving levels, meanwhile, are pretty, but less mind blowing. They seem to lack in both texture detail and geometry compared to the first-person stages, and they also run with inconsistent framerates, which is practically inexcusable. Still, they have their moments too. The car models, for instance, are detailed and the sense of physics is also quite triumphant. In the snowy race level there is some real-time destruction, not to mention more subtle additions like ice reflections, and these look great. Meanwhile, the underwater mission is very atmospheric and big, and thanks to some top animation it looks as if the vehicle is really floating through the depths of the ocean.      One element that both types of play styles share in common is variation. Each new level is totally different from the next in style and look. From the snow to the water to outer space, to warehouses, to submarines, to skyscrapers and night, it all looks different and is very engaging in its own special way. Hats off for the selection.  Oh, and thanks for the progressive scan option. What a difference it makes.  Sound NightFire sounds great from beginning to end. The game features a virtual ton of voice dialogue, lots of cut-scenes that explain the story, and huge selection of gadget-specific sound effects. On top of everything else, the music is great. The opening theme song, for instance -- very cool, nails the very essence of the franchise and sounds wonderful doing it. Later, as you pick up the Phoenix laser gun, you'll smile at the crunch and thump the powerful weapon emits as it blasts opponents down with a single shot. From the clank of the grappling hook on metal to the boom of the shotgun and the echo of the sniper rifle, everything sounds exactly as it should and it all runs in surround sound.NightFire is a fun Bond game. It's a hell of a solid 007 outing, too, whether it's a great first-person shooter or an enjoyable racer you're after. And yet, while I admire EA's decision to mingle several gameplay types into one package, I would have preferred it if NightFire were a first-person shooter and nothing else because frankly, that's where it excels.The FPS missions in the game are well balanced, combining elements of stealth and superior action too, overflowing with cool spy gadgets, and the 3D engine powering it all is one of the best I've seen on any home console. The driving missions, which lack the technical edge and depth of the shooter stages, simply don't fair as well. NightFire is a bit on the short side, there is the rare occurrence of shooting an enemy with no reaction, and in the multiplayer mode you don't seem to be able to run as fast as I'd like, but even with these issues this is still the best Bond game since GoldenEye, easily. It makes Agent Under Fire look very simplistic and outdated by comparison, and that's the truth.Recommended to everybody. But if you're a 007 fan, NightFire is a must.", "date": "Nov 18, 2002"}
