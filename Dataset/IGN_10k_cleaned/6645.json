These are simple, arcade-style racers that are designed with ease-of-use in mind. DChoc figures that with little to no learning curve, anybody can jump right in and enjoy the game. It's a good philosophy that works well in this case, as Moto Racing Fever is one of the most pick-up-and-play racers on mobile right now. That said, it does lack the depth of ~deeper~ racers like Need for Speed Most Wanted and Asphalt: Urban GT 2. So, if you want a racer that's has more than one vehicle and a handful of tracks, Moto Racing Fever might not be your bag.   Personally, it's my bag. I like those other racers quite a bit (especially Most Wanted), but I also enjoyed just how simple it was to dig right into Moto Racing Fever. There's a story mode that spins a little tale about an ultra-secret bike club which serves as the frame for a series of nine races. Of course, you can just play a quick race, but the story -- which takes you from New York to San Francisco (with a stop at Mt. Rushmore) -- is breezy fun.   You pilot your bike through winding tracks with plenty of bumps and jumps, avoiding cars and barricades while trying to best the racers from the elite racing squad. You can pick up nitrous boosts that give you quick bursts of speed, allowing you to put some distance between you and your rivals -- which is displayed on a handy meter along the top of the racing screen. Using nitrous boosts more than your speed -- it also gooses your score.    Moto Racing Fever comes in two editions: 2D and 3D. On the surface, they seem like fairly identical games, save for that added set of polygons and the fact that the 3D version strips out the other cars on the track and replaces them with copious barricades. However, after extensively playing each version, the 3D edition of Moto Racing Fever is definitely the harder of the two. On the 3D edition, I was falling behind the pack in the second race while I never lost until the sixth race in the 2D version.   I chalk it up to control responsiveness and the difference in nitro placement on the track. The 2D version moves at a solid clip, and the bike feels completely digital -- either you're driving straight or turning. This makes navigating around corners a lot easier. In the 3D version, there is a degree of ~analog-ness~ to turning. When you press 4 or 6 to turn the bike, there is a second before you really slide into the corner, accompanied by an animation of the rider starting to tip the bike. That's certainly realistic to some degree, and it adds some challenge to the game. You need to plan corners a little more in advance than you do on the 2D version.   Nitro boosts are also a little easier to get in the 2D version of Moto Racing Fever. Whereas there are three nitrous icons on the track in the 2D game, there is only one at a time in the 3D version. Steering into the three-stack is easy, thanks to the on-off turning, while it's easy to miss the singular nitro boost placed in the dead center of the track on the 3D version. Again, if you aren't near the center of the track, you need that extra second or two to start turning inward to grab the nitrous -- and it's easy to simply pass it by.   Obviously, there are differences in the graphics. The 3D edition sports a sweet set of polys. The racer and his rivals benefit from some good depth and detail that just isn't found in the 2D edition. The way the gates break apart and fly into the distance and the speed lines that rush toward the screen when you hit the nitrous -- those are little touches that just look great. This is not to say the 2D edition looks bad -- it doesn't. The sprites have solid detail and the backdrops make great use of the color.  Moto Racing Fever is a good, fast little racer with zero entry barrier -- halfway through the first race, you have all the tools and skills needed to play through the remainder of the game. That's good mobile gaming design, as it makes the game completely accessible to almost anybody. As mentioned, some will find the game (especially the 2D version) a little too shallow and easy. For them, there are alternatives by other mobile makers and I encourage them to go check those games out. But if you want a breezy racer you can jump in and out of throughout the day when you have a spare few minutes, Moto Racing Fever comes recommended.", "date": "Feb 21, 2006"}
