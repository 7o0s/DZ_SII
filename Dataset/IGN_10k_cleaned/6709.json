{"name": "NBA in the Zone", "name_review": "NBA in the Zone", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/26/nba-in-the-zone", "text": "Sports games tend to fall into one of three categories -- they're either intense, hyper realistic sims with real players, full teams, full seasons, and digitized announcers. These are for the die hard sports fanatic, who demands the full sports viewing experience. Then there are games like the excellent NBA Jam that junk realism in favor of surreal, fighter-style special moves. The third tend to fall somewhere in the middle, and generally disappoint everyone.  In The Zone has set up camp firmly in the third category, and adamantly refuses to budge. To begin with, there are only five players per team, with no substitutions. There's also no season, only playoffs and exhibitions. In fact, the game plays more like a Sports Illustrated tape of slam dunk highlights than an actual game. And while this may seem interesting at first, it can't sustain the type of longterm commitment that a true sports sim can.   Jason Boor", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
