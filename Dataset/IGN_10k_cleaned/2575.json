With tons of possible sub-categories already scattered throughout the genre, be it off-road, street, F1, NASCAR, futuristic, kart, or whatever else they can think of, finding the right speedster just for you may prove both trying and overwhelming.   Sorely, the selection in the Rally department hasn't been as vast. Limited to just a few average or incrementally better choices, reliving the PSOne days of such classics as Colin McRae Racing or Rally Cross seem more distant than they should be. Imagine my surprise then, when I popped in Evolution Studios European success WRC and was damn near blown away.   The first officially licensed FIA sponsored racer on the PS2, World Rally Championship looks and feels like the real thing. Jam-packed with the same television style production value that the British series has, every intro to every race is like participating in the weekly show itself. Emblazoned with a futuristic analysis of the globe, and hi-tech track information all over the screen, this isn't your father's rally. Video introductions to each evolving area supply plenty of background and history to setup your racing experience, and the FMV is some of the best sports-level video on the PlayStation 2 so far (Including perhaps the longest opening cinema in the history of racing games).   To further enhance the realism, every car, racer, and co-pilot from the 2001 World Rally Championship has been thrown into the blender. With career wins, rankings, team symbols, and other little details from our European buddies littering the play field. Want tons of environments? Done! Need as many stages as possible? You got it! With 14 separate rallies and over 100 different tracks there's more than enough for even the most hardened of racing fans.   Even cooler is the ability to customize your auto for any given situation. Using track information to judge what kind of setup you need, aspiring mechanics can select three different possibilities in five distinctive categories; For instance, let's assume that you're competing in the International Swedish Rally on the second stage, Sagen. It's snowing in flurries up and down the mountain, covering the road with a thick, dense powder your car has to be personalized to survive.   A quick trip to the proper screen unveils the choices before you: Gear Ratio, Brake Strength, Steering, Tires, and Suspension. Considering the terrain, we want maximum acceleration and lower top speed, so we'll set the gear ratio to short. I like to live dangerously, so we'll keep the brakes normal, but the steering fast for super-responsive turns. Wrapping this baby up I'll embed those spikes in my tires and keep the suspension at medium, perfect for an icy situation or so I hope.      And that's part of what makes World Rally Championship so frigging cool. Deep within its options, possibilities, and various game modes, you have an immensely playable racing game. These types of titles are usually victims of realism over fun, but WRC successfully manages to mix the both with few consequences. In fact, there were only two real snippets of a problem in the gameplay that I could spot; one of which was the sometimes-floaty control and the other being the bizarre damage system.   Driving your way through a squishy-response time is easily overcome with practice, and is probably the basis for coining the term ~learning curve~. While it certainly could have been a little better behaved when in terms of technicalities, driving your car is about as instinctive and familiar as you're going to get. The wrecked car simulation however, is a little less forgiving as it seems to be almost random. Sure you may smack into a guardrail a few times and knock your bumper off or smash a headlight, but the consistency of what kinds of damage is done to your auto per situation is screwy.   Crashing into the side of a mountain or falling off a cliff may completely total your car, keeping you from advancing or requiring you to restart the race all together. Then again nothing may happen at all in the extreme situations, while bumping into a moderate rock could result in sudden disaster. It's strange yes, but the good times outweigh the bad times, and the sheer fun of getting into a race (especially the full-on championship) could make you forget all about the negatives.   Visually the game truly excels, with out of this world textures and a rare attention to detail I really grew to appreciate. Taken from real world locations and objects each piece of snow, tree, mountain, or whatever is a pretty, pretty sight. Skylines and hills are simply breathtaking, with a photo realistic flare and lighting effects to match. The artists even went so far as to individually detail snowflakes as they fall onto the surface of your windshield. How cool is that?   Also for the first time that we can ever remember, a video game finally acknowledges that there are two dudes sitting in the cockpit in a rally race. One my favorite perspectives I've ever had in any racing game, you can actually zoom into the shell of a car and play from the view of your teammates. Over the shoulders of the both of them, you can watch as your navigator whips out maps of the area and nods in agreement to your driving decisions, all the while gazing at your pilot who turns on his windshield wipers, manually shifts gears, and adjusts the steering wheel to how you're driving it.   There are countless other angles you can race or replay in, with everything from an outside-looking-in-shot of your buddies, to the classic Daytona ~over the car~ perspective. Motion-blur, subtle light trails, skid marks, dust clouds, you name it and it's probably in here. My only graphical suggestion would be to improve the car models a bit and speed up the admittedly slow load times... One of the most pleasant surprises I've had in quite sometime, WRC: World Rally Championship is among the top racers for PlayStation 2 available so far. Eye-numbing visuals, easy to pick up driving, excellent stage design, and more modes and secrets than you can shake a stick at, Evolution Studios have created a monster. Hell, even the soundtrack is great!A definite must-buy for rally and general racing fans, BAM! Entertainment may have the beginnings of a brand new franchise on their hands. Deep, fun, and even better to look at, WRC is all that it claims to be and more.", "date": "Mar 22, 2002"}
