Those days are past.  The goodness of the franchise, as seen with Triple Play '96, has now become a joke with the train wreck of Triple Play 2002.  No need to hold the suspense until the end of the review.  Triple Play 2002 combines incredibly choppy animations, lackluster commentary, and an overall lack of fun.  Some games can only manage to be weak in one area, but Triple Play pulls off the trifecta failing in graphics, sound, and gameplay.   FeaturesFull teams and rosters  All 30 Major League stadiums  Bob Costas and Harold Reynolds commentary  Alternate uniforms  Gameplay  As much as people tout graphics, the true test of a video game is how it plays.  This couldn't be more true than with a sports title.  Games can be ugly and still be champs.  Just look at High Heat last year.  So, while the graphics for Triple Play are pretty awful, the game could still be saved with superior gameplay.  It's not.   At the plate  Batting is arcade-like, rather than being simmy.  That wouldn't be a big deal if Triple Play weren't trying to pass itself off as a sim.  The batting cursor consists of a red oval inside a larger blue oval.  Red is the power zone, the blue is contact.  The size will vary depending on the batters skill.  Those who love home run derby will be filled with joy.  Every game is a home run derby.  Balls fly out of the yard as if the game was played on the moon.  Even on the hardest mode, batting is a bit too easy.  It just isn't baseball.   On the mound  Pitching is tougher than hitting.  See, it's easy for you or the computer to knock the ball around.  Strikeouts, or even getting the ball past the batter, can be a tough proposition sometimes.  Taking a page from High Heat, pitches float when delivered to the plate.  When Roger Clemens throws a 96mph fastball in my mug, I want it to come in blazing fast.  I don't want it to look like a pitch I'd throw.  Since the balls come in at a leisurely pace, it's easy to get a good swing on them.  And with all those balls going for an intercontinental flight, I found myself singing fly me to the moon far too often.  How come the game I played isn't this pretty??  In the field  Fielding is fairly easy, with the ball represented as a giant shadow.  The infield is a snap, though the controls are not as responsive as they need to be.  You want to get rid of the ball quickly, but there's a second or two delay before you can get off a throw to the second baseman.  The outfield is enormous.  There's way too much ground to cover.  It's like you're a little kid out there, trying to chase after a ball in the outfield.  And the fielding is sluggish overall.     A.I.  Of course, a baseball game is nothing without good AI.  There aren't a lot of bonehead plays that the computer will make.  Though it's way too easy to catch a runner leaning off base after a hit.  My main complaint is with the ratings.  Some of these teams seem way off.  When did the Braves fielding drop so low?  Nothing I ever saw on the field.  And yet in Triple Play they are near the bottom in how the game rates fielding.  The Mariners stats actually rival the all-star teams.  Way, way too high.  And for all those high ratings, the Mariners finished last in all three of my simulated seasons.  They were 20 games below .500 twice.  And I'm totally confused as to how it determines the World Series MVP.  Ramon Hernandez won MVP honors with a .218 batting average and only four RBIs in the series.  If that's an MVP, where the heck is my trophy?   The pitching AI is really rather bland.  You never feel like you are facing a big league pitcher.  Everything seems more random than calculated.  And of course, with hitting being so easy, pitching often becomes an exercise in frustration.  A baseball sim needs a solid AI.  Triple Play isn't littered with AI bugs, but the AI seems really simplistic.  This hampers the game, keeping it from being a true baseball experience.  I thought it was the green monster  I left the fun in my other pants  So, if you don't have the graphics, and the gameplay isn't stellar, the last bastion of hope is that the game still manages to be fun.  But there is no hope for Triple Play.  To play through an entire season of this game would take a will far stronger than mine.  Whether alone or with a friend, Triple Play is no fun at all.  The thrill of hitting a home run is quickly sapped away by the time you've hit your fourth dinger in the inning.  And since you don't even get to watch your victory trot around the bases, it feels pretty cheap.     You're not going to get any of the nice touches that make All-Star Baseball and High Heat (for the PS2 and PC) stand out.  I never saw a passed ball, or a batted ball hit off a pitchers leg.  The game doesn't even get bean balls right.  Sure, if you get beaned in the noggin, your fellah drops to his knees, grabs his head, and shakes it off.  However, if you get hit in the leg, your player drops to his knees, grabs his head, and shakes it off.  Am I the only one who sees something wrong here?   Modes of play  There are four modes of play for Triple Play 2002.  There's no franchise mode, which really should be the standard now.  It's interesting that All-Star Baseball 2003 uses Madden-like player cards, but EA's own baseball game doesn't.  That should be a definite inclusion for next year.  Here's a handy dandy list of all four modes of play.  Make sure you try 'em all:Single Game - One exhibition game between any teams ya like.  Season - Customizable length.  Play a whole season and see if you can make it to the big show.  Playoffs - Who needs 162?  Start the playoffs now with any team.  Even the Expos.  Home Run Derby - Slug it out in a classic battle for testosterone supremacy.  Players can be traded one-for-one.  And there's no trade blocking.  So if you want to make a team of studs, go right ahead.  Again EA fails to add anything sim-worthy to the game.  Once more, another arcade-like feature.  Create-a-player is decent.  There are sixteen varieties of facial hair, so you can give your man a stinger or some lengthy sideburns.  That's the best of the customizations.  With only five faces to choose from and no accessories to add, the create-a-player mode leaves you wanting more.  There are no limits when distributing stats.  So if you want your ballplayer to have max stats, there's nothing stopping you.    Graphics  This game will hurt your eyes.  It's hard to find positives regarding the visuals.  The stadiums are very well done, though the colors seem off for some of them.  There's no activity in the stadium.  New York's big apple doesn't rise up when you hit a home run and there's no passing train to be found in Seattle.  For some reason, the ground textures vary.  Sometimes you will play a game and they will look fantastic.  Grass will be worn down in spots and the overall quality of the field textures will be superb.  And then you'll play another game, and everything is very plain and the textures are very basic.  How can you not even have consistent field textures in a baseball game?     There's no 'ass' in Triple Play, but there should be  Triple Play 2002 is so choppy, I actually had to look away from it at times.  And this isn't just when balls are in play.  Players jitter as they step to the plate and celebrations are marred with lost frames.  I can't remember seeing such a lack of polish in a baseball sim before.  There are a few nice animations in the game.  Mainly double plays, which are quick, usually smooth, and appropriately cinematic.  It's the rest of the animations that will have you heaving into a paper bag.   And no, that's no exaggeration.  As your player stands at the plate, waggling his bat, you'll often see he bat jump slightly as it recycles.  Yeah, even bat waggle isn't smooth here.  And then it gets worse when the floating pitch is hit and chop chop chops its way into the outfield.  Speaking of the outfield, it's huge.  You'll have a hard time getting to a lot of balls and it will seem to take far too long to get to those that get by you, or drop in front of you.  The proportions of the field and players are off.     Call me stumpy  If you're looking for well-detailed, properly proportioned player models, avert your eyes.  There are none in Triple play 2002.  Every player looks stumpy, with big head and squatty bodies.  No one looks like their real self.  The face mapping is a joke.  Most players look ugly as a pug and are unrecognizable.  You know, when you can't even get players to look like people, and not some dwarven half-breed, that's a bad sign.     One nice thing about the game (aside from the nicely rendered stadiums) are the player reactions.  Shoulders slump after a batter strikes out.  The camera gets in close for the pained reaction of a pitcher who's just given up a gopher ball.     Sound  One of the elements of baseball that's often overlooked is sound.  The crowd and commentators can bring you into the game and make a good baseball game great.  At the same time, bland crowds and commentary can make a game feel more drawn out than it really is.  EA's focus clearly wasn't on the ambience in this game.  The crowd is mostly just an uninteresting generic roar, with the occasional heckle or vendor lending their voice to the game.  The crowd will chant the team's name during a rally and sometimes you'll hear some jerk blowing an air horn.  The PA announcer doesn't do player introductions, which would have been a nice touch.     There are a few different sounds for hits.  A ball on the sweet spot will sound more solid than a ball in on the hands.  But the bat just doesn't quite sound right.  Overall the atmosphere manages to be adequate, but below what's been done in other baseball ventures.  This certainly wasn't EA's focus.  Randy?  In the booth  In the broadcast booth are Bob Costas and Harold Reynolds. Costas does the play-by-play and Reynolds comes in occasionally with some color commentary. Tracks for these games are recorded separately and it's up to sound engineers to make the two tracks sound as if they were done together. That way you feel like Costas and Reynolds are in the booth together. Here, the two sound disjointed. Costas is fine with play-by-play, though his low key approach doesn't quite translate to console baseball. Reynolds comments are basically useless and seem to just pop up randomly. He'll tell you ~he stretched that double into a triple~ or that a marquee player is the bomb diggity, but it just doesn't sound natural.  On there own, each of these broadcasters does a fine job.  But together, and in a video game, they are mismatched.   Hair metal lives on  Though I wouldn't normally devote a whole paragraph to the music played during a menu screen, I think Triple Play merits the words.  There are several hair metal tracks that play on the menu screen.  It's like you've stepped into a time machine and it's 1990 again.  Scary.  Not only does this music not fit, it's downright terrible.  What were they thinking?  Or were they thinking?  I love baseball.  It's my favorite sport.  I have season tickets to the A's, can name you every starter in the majors, and can hold my own with baseball trivia.  So, for me, this is one of my favorite times of the year.  I look forward to the new crop of baseball titles.  I know what makes for a good baseball game, having played so many over the years.  And let me tell you, Triple Play doesn't have any of it.  I always try to point out both the positive and negatives of a title.  But beyond the pretty stadiums, there's nothing that rises above mediocrity in Triple Play.  Yes, it really is that bad.  What's truly upsetting is that it doesn't seem like EA is even trying with its baseball title anymore.  It's as if Madden and NHL are the only sports titles they deem worthy of a hearty effort.  You're better off not owning a baseball game this year, than owning this one.", "date": "Mar 19, 2002"}
