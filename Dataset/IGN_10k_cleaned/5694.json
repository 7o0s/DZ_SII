{"name": "Silent Scope", "name_review": "Silent Scope", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/04/21/silent-scope", "text": "Upstart Games has enjoyed a profitable relationship with Konami for several months now, porting over their catalog of classic console and arcade titles to mobile with much success. Based on such an impressive track record (Gradius and Castlevania were exemplary products), we greedily downloaded Silent Scope the moment we saw it on the game deck. Our test phone was a Sanyo 8200 -- not the most advanced phone in the stable, but a workhorse that many, many people carry around. However, despite its limitations, the 8200 can certainly play games. And while Upstart's ported Silent Scope is far from perfect, it's a decent little diversion for fans of the franchise -- or just shooting bad guys in the face.   The game's story mode follows a basic premise. You are a super sniper sent in to take down a terrorist plot. The main screen shows the environment -- for example, a skyscraper -- and potential targets are noted with a yellow mark. When you see the yellow appear, direct the cursor over the spot and switch to scope mode for a close up of the action. Zero in on the bad guy and shoot him to take him down. Time and bullets are of the essence, so you are better off going for a headshot ASAP.   While in scope mode, a red arrow points in the direction of the next nemesis, but scrolling around the screen in scope mode is too slow. You have to pop back out to the full view and readjust the firing cursor. It's a simple formula, but it pretty much works. Silent Scope isn't exactly advanced mobile fun, but it manages to nail the essence of the franchise.   Naturally, the 8200 port doesn't look like a million. Or a thousand, even. The terrorist sprites look alright through the scope, but the environments aren't terribly detailed. The firing cursor moves a little ploddingly, which gets a little frustrating as you advance to harder, faster challenges -- but them's the breaks for a sniper. The game does have a little jingle that blares out of the 8200 speakers and the sound effects are okay.Silent Scope is what it is: a mobile approximation of the arcade/console game. Go in with lofty expectations and you will be disappointed -- but that's what you'll have coming to you. Scale back your wants and Silent Scope provides some fine timekilling fun. It's not deep, it's not going to last forever on your handset. But if you can part with a few bucks and like the idea of dropping thugs with one between the eyes, Silent Scope will offer something for you.
