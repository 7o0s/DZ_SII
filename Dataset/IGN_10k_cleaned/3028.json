But a few stalwarts held back on faith, wondering if BAM could really handle the underground fave with integrity and consistency. After all, if they blew it with the series at all, chances would be that we'd never see another Fire Pro Wrestling game in America. So far so good, as the first Fire Pro Wrestling for Game Boy Advance was enough of a success to warrant a sequel and an upcoming GameCube version. But it's from here on out that BAM will have to prove itself to the diehards, beginning with Fire Pro Wrestling 2.   Features  New career mode with unlockable wrestlers in the Ironman Road 10 wrestling characters in 18 teams Battle in the electrified deathmatch, fighting octagon, and Battle Royal  Complex create-a-wrestler mode Only for Game Boy Advance   What Fire Pro Wrestling 2 is, after a fairly good start with the original, is the latest expansion of the long-running series, with more of everything you could possibly want. It's a bigger collection of moves, featuring the depth of the series' catalog in some way or other. It's an even deeper wrestler creation mode. It's a complete game, with a career mode that gives foundation to the sprawling depth. And it's a refinement on the controls of the original game and whole series that, while even after all these years still has its kinks, makes it a more capable fighter. Also, with a great Training Mode that instantly and correctly teaches gamers the ins and outs of the unique and acute fighting system, Fire Pro Wrestling 2 is the game that has the best chance of conquering a new audience. In some ways, it's the game that should have been waited for.  What it is not is Final Fire Pro Wrestling.  When the sequel to the first GBA Fire Pro hit Japan, fans of the series got something original and engrossing in a full RPG management mode that let you set your wrestlers up in the rankings and carry him through the drama and turmoil of a real season in the wrestling circuit. Fire Pro Wrestling 2 unfortunately does not have the same feature. Now, I can offer you a dozen reasons why, some very good ones at that -- reasons extending from the simple answer that BAM had no choice in getting the game out before Christmas since a niche game like Fire Pro will never sell outside of the holiday and therefore would not have been possible any other way, to the honest possibility that the well-known perfectionists Spike decided against converting the mode because they couldn't have gotten it right in the American version with their resources and time demands -- but the bottom line is that it's not there.   Whether fans excuse the excuses and go for the gameplay or chalk up the exclusion as a sign of BAM not in it for the real Fire Pro devotees, that depends on how long they've been into the game and how deep they'll play (having a few friends to go rounds in multiplayer should help ease the pain a bit.) However, it is a huge loss, and the game seems empty as a sequel without the mode. The Ironman Road story mode is pretty weak, (as are most wrestling game story modes on even big consoles-- what's the trouble here folks?) with a dull string of the same matches end on end and not much of a real story to get into (although it is smart how you have to manage your team to make sure you're not both wrecked going into the next match.) And since FPW has always been an incredibly deep and exhaustive game, the number of additions put into the game (which are actually slim in the sequel -- no big gains like last year's Audience Rankings mode) just don't amount to much -- it's like pouring a cup into an ocean. There are actually fewer modes on the menu to play with than there were last time, and although you can customize your exhibition matches to make up most of the match types, (Audience Ranks, Battle Royals and Royal Rumbles) there is no customizable Tournament mode this time out in the main game.  If BAM were delivering everything, then this game would be a clear-cut winner for everybody. Since they're not, the game will likely polarize audiences into three camps. The gamers who have never played a Fire Pro should go straight-away for this version. It's got all the depth and gameplay that have made the series a legend. It's also got some killer features that make it vastly superior to last year's game. The Practice Dojo alone is a killer, teaching you all the timing and technique in the game (it'll also run you through some of the things that the publisher foolishly forgot to put in the manual -- didn't they forget to include the commands for how to pin [A+B on a downed opponent] last time too?) There's also a killer Wrestler's List feature that gives detail and character to all 200 of the ~fictional~ wrestlers, (many gamers will recognize from the look and backstory on these figures that they're styled after famous wrestling icons) making unlocking the game's features vastly rewarding. I was also able to get into the game's bizarre import qualities -- you'll find arenas where fans are seated at ringside kneeling on mats, which you'd never see at any American sporting event -- and really take the game as a wrestler set in the hotly-contested Japanese wrestling circuit. Maybe it was the distinctly Japanese wrestling teacher in the Training Dojo (who seemed straight out of a Japanese-dubbed version of Rocky -- ~too r'wate ... too eawlie!~) or maybe it was the more involving story mode (despite some Japanglish) that sold the Japanese setting, but it sort of works for me now. If newbie fans can dig that flavor, there's a lot to get out of Fire Pro Wrestling 2.  Previous fans of the series, however, may not be able to justify getting the second game. The changes are just not significant enough for most. Especially the new-found fans of the series looking forward to the second game after being introduced with the original GBA version, this one may feel like the exact same game. In some ways, it'll feel inferior. The music is VASTLY worse in the second game -- what happened to all the stereo effects? -- and the audio mixing during the rounds now just sounds like a muddle of noise. The graphics are exactly the same, which is a big bummer -- no effects or anything new. Some controls have been fixed -- you don't float off the top ropes -- but running is still inaccurate and a weak point in the gameplay. Tag team play is just not context-sensitive enough -- you'll miss some needed tags. The CAW is still great, but it was great last time. Basically, everything that you loved and hated about your first Fire Pro experience is exactly the same in the sequel, and I'm not sure what you'd get out of the sequel.  Then there's the long-time fans of FPW. For them, it's a must-own in any case, and the addition of some recognizable moves from the series will deliver a completist experience -- users on our message boards were happy to see the inclusion of rare moves from the Dreamcast version such as the Shining Wizard. But even they must be a little apprehensive about having this sequel handed to them so quickly and with so little new. The game doesn't add anything significant to the engine or design -- no Six-Man Scrambles for more intense gameplay, no dedicated Queen's League feature to represent the lady wrestler factions (you can create female wrestlers, but they'll fight all the rest of the guys.) And, of course, no Management Mode.    On its own, Fire Pro Wrestling 2 is still a superior game, one that's a much better package than the original. THQ made some strides this year with its WWE title (against ALL odds,) but it still can't touch the total package that are the tight gameplay and incredibly deep creation features of FPW. Wrestling fans owe it to themselves to get a sampling of the underground phenom.But, as a sequel, Fire Pro Wrestling 2 isn't all that it could and should have been. Spike still delivered the package, and diehards will be able to get their pie-ful from seeing the inclusion of new moves and career features. It just doesn't feel like enough.Going forward, BAM needs to be very careful how it handles the franchise. If the followers can hang with updates instead of sequels, things may go smooth from here on out, but I'm not sure that they will. A feature-stripped sequel annually just won't cut it. BAM traditionally doesn't have that hardcore niche audience that a company like Koei or Working Designs have with their devotee audience. If fans smell a mark, they'll drop their loyalty, and BAM is teetering on the line -- lost features, rushed conversion, changed titles, even funky American box art have already begun to raise eyebrows of fans. As long as Spike manages to kick out killer gameplay, maybe that's all that matters. It's on them now.", "date": "Oct 8, 2002"}
