Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/12/13/disneys-kim-possible-whats-the-switch-review", "text": "Franchise games are almost always doomed. There are hundreds of licensed titles where the most exciting part of the experience is the packaging as it seems that most publishers figure that's all they need to make a sale. Thankfully, Disney's Kim Possible: What's the Switch? breaks free of this stereotype with gameplay that's fun and challenging, while keeping a brisk pace. This is a title that doesn't talk down to kids as it's trying to entertain them and the world is a better place for that.   While fighting for a monkey idol, Kim's pal Ron Stoppable and Dr. Drakken have their brains switched with each other. This leads to Kim and Shego, normally enemies, working together to get the idol back and put everything back in order. Playing the game alternates between characters as they charge through different areas. Occasionally, Kim's mole rat Rufus has some adventuring as well. And if this paragraph makes complete sense to you, then you're well versed in the Kim Possible world.   The world of Kim Possible is very cartoonish and uses the 2.5-dimensional style of Viewtiful Joe. All the action is side-scrolling with plenty of platforming, but it is a 3D world and the camera moves around to take advantage of this. The fighting is all right and a little bit of a challenge, but the real star of the game is the environment and learning how to explore it.    With a couple of small differences, playing with Kim and Shego is nearly identical. Their jumps, punches and kicks, and even their grappling hooks function in the same way. Getting the hang of playing with each one is very straightforward and the game has an elegant way of showing off each new move as it becomes available. A shadow form of Kim or Shego appears and demonstrates what to do. But learning the moves is really just the beginning.   Like with Viewtiful Joe, the moves may be simple, but the uses can be complicated. There are loads of hidden coins and items to find on each of the levels and getting them all is a pretty serious challenge that takes some observation. It's definitely not easy, but it is rewarding. Many coins are visible, but just out of reach. Only by unlocking each combination of jumps and swings can they be picked up. Those who want to just play the game can do so, but there's plenty more.   As the game progresses there's always a sense of variety and movement. Instead of repeating the same section of type of section the changes happen often enough to keep the gameplay fresh. One moment it's fighting tons of monkeys, the next it's jumping from car to car on the freeway, and then it switches to a different character somewhere else; it's a fun and excellent way of bringing these characters to life.   Since the game is tied in with a cartoon it benefits from professional voice talent and has a smooth animation style that works perfectly here. Instead of being tacked on the game feels like an extension of the cartoon world and is well suited to fans of the series who are also very much into gaming. Kids who are new to gaming may have a hard time of it as there are some tricky parts, but it's worth the effort.   With so many nice parts to the game there is still one big issue: the length of the levels. There are plenty of extra lives so finishing each level isn't too much of a problem, but trying to collect all of the hidden items can be too much work. A group of levels require collecting 250 tokens in order to unlock hidden features. This is a bit absurd since many tokens aren't obvious and missing just one is failure. This makes the replaying of the game a little too frustrating and not as much fun as the rest of the game is.Disney's Kim Possible: What's the Switch? is a great platformer for both fans of the show and fans of similar types of games. It doesn't break new ground and still has a couple of flaws, but it's a solid execution of a licensed game and that's so rare it's frightening. Mixing both simplicity and complexity it's worth a look and is a consistent game from start to finish.", "date": "Dec 13, 2006"}
