They have millions of great ideas left over from they '80s vanguard days, and they pretty much just recycle them over and over. Sometime the formula is a brilliant winner: NBA Showtime came from NBA Hangtime, NBA Jam, and originally Arch Rivals, and NFL Blitz' birth parents were High Impact Football and Pigskin. When Midway is on and treating their properties with care and enthusiasm, they can lead the world to water.  And then there are games like Rampage. Sometimes you go to the well one too many times, and sometimes you go to the well that first time and find it dry. In Rampage's  instance, Midway went to a dried, caved-in, sealed-up, haunted-by-the-ghosts-of-Baby-Jessica-copy-cat-children well, knocked off the dust and cement cap, and dug up sludgy barren muck. Then they did it again. And now again. The game had potential -- what game with giant monsters going berserk on major metropolises doesn't have some initial promise? But instead of nurturing the arcade concept into an enjoyable cartoon demolition romp, they passed it off to a side staff and shipped it as soon as possible. And then again. And now again...   Gameplay The major difference between Rampage World Tour (and Rampage Universal Tour) and this new Rampage Through Time isn't the loss of the word ~tour~. Unfortunately, it's also not in the gameplay either. The control is the same shameful Rampage we've seen in the last two Rampage titles that's somehow inferior in countless ways to its decrepit old ancestor. Why can't monsters punch sideways down a building and slide downward thrusts down its side? Why can't you punch something that's slightly off the screen when you know perfectly well that it's there and sometimes can even climb onto it? And why can't they knock out parts of another building from across the way while hanging on another building. Simple strategies came from these two tactics in the simplistic arcade game, but those missing tricks here make gameplay too basic for even a four year old to enjoy.   But it wasn't the control that they changed in Rampage Through Time. And it wasn't the storyline either. They don't have one. Actually, they do, but it's just backdrop storyline to hang the gameplay on, and it's a flimsy hanging line at that. The game opens with a goofy news spoof that's so bizarre that it's almost funny. (Now if they could only learn that comedy is in the timing.) From the news clips, we learn that the Rampage characters have slipped into a time warp. But then that's it. No clever newspaper clippings like the arcade game, no footage between rounds. If you want to be encouraged to continue on into the game, you had better learn to think that bashing futuristic and historic buildings (all of which look and smash the same) is high hilarity, because that's the end-all and be-all of the charm of this game.  No, the sole change in Rampage is a soul change -- the game isn't at all about bashing buildings at all. Oh, that's in there. It takes an awful lot of your time. But these smash rounds are really just exercises leading up to Rampage bonus rounds. And these bonuses aren't about playing Rampage, or about using skills in Rampage battles. Instead, it's a test of your ability to play Pac-Man or Asteroids. Say what? Yep, once you lay mass annihilation to a world, you get to play a round of old '80s 8-bit arcade games with Rampage characters subbed in for the original heroes. Wreck havoc in the Old West and you're treated to a game of Catapult where Lizzy wears a ten-gallon hat. Smash Gangland Chicago and you're treated to a lovely game of Combat. Yippie-skippy. The only reason to even try in the smashing rounds is to gain bonus stars for the bonus rounds -- you can't even die in the main part of the game!    Graphics This was perhaps passable about ten years ago when the first Rampage XXX Tour came out (now that would have been a game!), but three generations into a 32-bit game and this is all the developers at Avalanche Studios have to show for themselves? The graphics are cruddy sprites with six or seven frames of animation total. The characters have evolved nicely from their original designs (and even the newbies are wacky -- I especially dig the Lobster that looks conspicuously like Jar Jar Binks), but what's the point when they all have the same stock animation and moves. At first glance, I thought it was funny when the rhino humped the building to knock it down (a silly animation for the kick button), but when I found that they all had the same animation, I knew no effort was done to make these characters fun for the kids.  It's just a weak-looking game. Midway has added a number of Mortal Kombat-type moves, and even super special moves to the new Rampage, but the net effect is just that stuff breaks and monsters get knocked down. Why bother to add the Uppercut attack from Mortal Kombat if the punch won't knock enemies way up in the air for a juggle combo?   And this would-be joyous romp of cruising and crashing through time quickly becomes dull as snot when you find that all of the buildings, whether they be futuristic skyscrapers, medieval castles, or countryside shanties are all the same rectangular buildings. Some are taller than others, but they are no more complex. They're just made up of more stacked sprites. When you kick a building, you can see the sprite layers shift slide like Jenga blocks. Just how hard would it be to redraw these monsters holding on to an angled building. But no, it's impossible for the sit-around team behind this Rampage series, and so trips to even national landmarks such as downtown Paris are dull because you can't destroy the Eiffel Tower. They can't even put in the Leaning Tower of Pisa because it's too complex for their engine... because it's leaning.  Sound If ever there were a case for narcoleptic laziness laid against Avalanche Studios for their lame Rampage series, it begins with the sound. They recorded a total of maybe three human sounds for these games -- a woman screaming, a man screaming, and an unknowable Pat screaming. And that's it. Even in a historical Rampage game, where they have plenty of opportunity for neat vocal jibes and gaffs, the people are limited to going, ~Ahhhhh!~ And the monsters fare no better. If Midway really wants these Rampage games to have some marketable character (and they sure as heck do), you wouldn't believe it from the uni-voice monster sounds. All kinds of Jurassic Park pig squeals and ostrich yelps filtered through phased-out amps and Darth Vader-voice box effects could have been used, but instead they simply recorded one guy going ~Roar!~ Then they gave that voice to each monster. We've been shafted. Thrice.    I came at this new Rampage trying to give the game a fair shake, a fresh look. I didn't love the old arcade game, but I though surely some fun might come of monsters rampaging through all kinds of different worlds. Maybe the developers found some way of re-injecting some of the brainless fun back into this freak show? But nope. Instead, they spent all their time thinking about how to build a better Pac-Man. What the hell here? This is a Rampage game, isn't it?", "date": "Jun 28, 2000"}
