It's what the system was pretty much designed for, and it's still a genre that has room for new ideas in the formula. And while Infogrames' and Hudson's Blender Bros. is a bit on the short side and not extremely pretty, it's a solid, enjoyable design with a couple of cool elements for the genre. Features Seven different planets 20 different Mini Bros. to collect and trade Three mini games Link cable support for four players (Single cartridge) Battery save (two slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  Blender Bros. features a cute little futuristic dog-thing named Blender...leader of the Cosmo Keepers and hero extraordinaire. The incredibly cryptic storyline has humans coexisting with creatures called Animalmen. Unfortunately, humans are now outnumbered by these Animalmen, and an anti-human group known as the Zooligans are out to make humankind extinct. It's up to Blender and his team to stop the Zooligans before they can go through with the elimination of the humans.  The game structure cuts across seven different planets, each with their own look and terrain. Blender can jump and do a short little hover thing with his huge ears, as well as whip enemies with his huge ears, pogo-hop to higher ledges with his huge ears, and climb up ropes with his huge ears. Sense a bit of a theme here?   The game's general design is pretty typical for a platformer, except for the idea of Mini Bros. Mini Bros. are cute little robot creatures that you can collect and use in a level. Each Mini Bros. creature has a special ability to exploit -- one offers a much longer attack range, another gives Blender the ability to recharge after an enemy hit. Not all levels in Blender Bros. feature Mini Bros. creatures, but you'll know where one is when you flap your ears in the air with the L button and see a red arrow pointing in a specific direction. There are a total of 20 Mini Bros. creatures in the game, but only about 10 of them are actually collectable. The rest have to be acquired by spending ~bones~ (Blender Bros. specific videogame currency) at the CD shop and purchasing music CDs that'll alter Mini Bros. into their evolved form. Or, if a friend has already done the dirty work, he can trade a Mini Bros. to you from his game to yours via the link cable. Yes, this game's just a little bit Pokemon, too.  Each planet also has a specific Mario Kart-style racing level in it that challenge you to speed through the area, collecting keys that'll stop the planet from self-destructing. These levels are incredibly simplistic and don't seem to fit the overall design...but without them we wouldn't get a cool multiplayer mini-game for folks with another GBA system and link cable. At the end of each planet, you'll face off against a large boss out to kick Blender's tail. Unfortunately, almost every single one of these bosses can be defeated with incredible ease...the only one posing any sort of challenge is the game's final boss. When you meet up with these guys, they'll chat it up with amazing, broken English that confuses more than informs. There's no doubt about it...Blender Bros. is a Japanese design. And the conversations pretty much confirm that.  It's not the prettiest platformer in the GBA's library, as the game's sprite animation and background quality isn't nearly up to the same levels as other games in the genre. But where it lacks in graphics, it makes up for it in tight control and solid level design. But as decent as the game is, it's over way too quickly. The level designs are very simple to complete with boss battles that are even easier. The game's unlimited continues and battery save attribute to the game's quick adventure, as you'll be done with the main game in about two hours of straight play. At least the game features great replay value with its three single cartridge multiplayer minigames, as well as its time trial modes for each completed round.       It's a shame the game had to be so easy to beat...Blender Bros. ends too soon. I'm guessing that's why the game includes three multiplayer mini-games for four players to join in...these games increase the replay value of Blender Bros.  because they're fun, and they only require one cartridge for four systems. The main game is fun, easy challenge...it's just way short. But the ride is definitely recommended.", "date": "Apr 29, 2002"}
