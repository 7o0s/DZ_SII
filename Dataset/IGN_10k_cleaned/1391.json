ESPN Winter X Games Snowboarding is one of the most complete, fully licensed snowboarding simulations ever, boasting some real next generation graphics, a great soundtrack, and lots of depth. It's a totally different experience that SSX, and a good one, too.   The only thing is, ESPN Winter X Games Snowboarding is often too sim-like, and often times frustrating. The learning curve is steep, and the control set up is a little awkward, making the actual gameplay annoying quite often. It's hard to admit that I can't beat every single game I play lickitysplit, but this one made me work quite a bit, and the last time I checked, work isn't synonymous with fun.   Gameplay Konami made a point of creating a simulation-heavy snowboarding game. One of the biggest benefits of this game design decision is that in every aspect, this game looks and feels like the real thing. At least 15 professional snowboarders were licensed, and their digital re-creation is quite impressive. They have real looking faces, with moving eyes and mouths, and if you squint your eyes a little they appear real. They're more realistic looking than any other snowboarding game on any system. Riders include Terje Haakonsen, Kevin Jones, Peter Line, Jamie Lynn, Travis Parker, Victoria Jelouse, Barrett Christy, Bjorn Leines, Devun Walsh, JP Walker, Rio Tahara, Shannon Dunn, Tara Dakides, Tina Basich, and Todd Richards. The licensing in this game is quit extensive, and it doesn't end with people's likenesses. Konami went out and nabbed gear licenses from 36 companies, with such big names as Oakley, Nike, Sims, Mountain Dew, Hurley, Smith, and more.   Of course, licensing doesn't a game make. But for a title that's bent on realism, it's important. To further this quest, Konami created several modes in which you can ride in contests, go for a session in halfpipes, ride against the clock in time attacks, go for a little of both in trick and air attacks, and jam around for the fun of things in Free Ride. The game offers some standard gameplay modes (X Games mode, Snowboarder X, Superpipe, Big Air, Slope Style, and Free Ride), but it also presents a set of very unique options, including the intricate Snowboarder Mode. In this mode, players create their own snowboarder, with such selectable choices as rider, head, height, weight, name, and nickname. Somewhat atypical, but there's more. You choose your equipment, boards, bindings, boots, jackets, pants, and goggles. After that you get your board fit. You choose the board setting, your stance, the front angle, the back angle, and the board width. The details are quite impressive.   Once you have created a player, you then enter the most hilariously bigheaded, Japanese cartoon-like section that appears to have been snuck into this game. On the outside, the game appears beautiful, polygonally lush, smooth and impressive. But in this little mode, your character transforms into a stick figure in a land of primitively animated 2D stick figures that wave their hands around and look silly. The mode is absolutely cool, and just a little dopey. Once in, you walk up to the stick figures and talk to them, entering into contests, making movies for points and money, taking helicopter rides to distant locations, moving up in the rankings and forward in your career. Needless to say, once you get the feel of it, this mode is not only deep and involving, it's just a little goofy, and we like that.   One of the biggest obstacles of ESPN Winter X Games Snowboarding is the character control. Many of the moves are quite easy to pull off, but getting accustomed to the sim-like mechanics and slightly awkward control takes time and patience. For instance, if you have played Tony Hawk Pro Skater then you'll be familiar with the X button as the jump set up. Triangle is for railslides, but Circle sets your board to carve, while Square minimizes the amount of air per jump, while helping to build up speed. What's weird here is that most games don't differentiate between regular turns and carves.   Here's where the game's actual realism gets in the way of the playing. Without much speed when you take a turn you'll slip sideways in the snow. You won't dig in. That's just like in real life, but it's not that fun. Take this situation and place your boarder in the halfpipe and you are guaranteed pure annoyance. If you bail on a trick, you not only lose speed and points, but additionally, because the pipe isn't very long (which is a design not a control issue), you're pretty much out sh&t out of luck, and will half to start over. Losing speed in this game is a very bad thing especially in a trick-based environment -- it's hard to get it back, but it's realistic. The half pipe and the courses themselves leave much to be desired in design. These could have been designed much better than this.   The actual trick system isn't too hard to learn. From there players can pull off all of the basic moves with a relatively easy control scheme. Press C and the direction pad for tricks, and to pull off different kinds of grabs, use Circle for Indy, R1 plus Circle for Mute, R1 plus Triangle for Method, and so on. Backflips, 360s, and others are also available. Linking tricks and sets of tricks is also quite fun and pretty easy, but it takes some time to master these guys. To really compete in competitions and win, you'll have to have mastered several sets of linkable sets of tricks for the big points. And if you ever do master this game, you'll be seeing some seriously high jumps, ripe for tons of tricks.   So getting used the sim-like mechanics and mastering the moves takes a while, more than pretty much any snowboarding game I have played. The learning curve isn't impossibly steep, it's just steep. Again, Konami went out of its way to make a sim, and it certainly has succeeded. The only problem I have with that is that a little bit of forgiveness would have helped a whole lot, even in a sim. I may have a lot of patience, but I'm paid to play games. We're talking about console gamers, here, not rocket scientists, and most people may just get frustrated and quit. I felt like it quite a few times.  Graphics Right from the start, this game's looks are impressive. ESPN Winter X Games Snowboarding is one of the better looking games on PlayStation 2. The player models are absolutely honed, refined, and beautifully designed. It's not so much that they are gorgeous, but the Konami's designers have worked hard and succeeded in creating life-like looking and moving models. All of the animation sequences are smooth and body movements are totally seamless. There are no glitches in the joints. The combination of excellent motion-captured movement with fluid animations -- that don't get in the way of the actual moves -- combine for very good-looking characters.   The game is flush with effects that create a realistic environment. The character's clothes (their pants and jackets) ripple in the wind as they gain speed. Their faces look in proportion and their eyes and mouths move. Unlike Madden, they have real looking eyes. Their clothes are baggy or tight, and look like the kinds of clothes real snowboarders wear. Even the board moves with a kind of grace and realism through the snow that's uncommon in snowboarding games. As you slice through a hillside, a trail is carved out behind and it remains there in the snow. The net effect of these elements is a sharp, refined look that's never been seen before in any snowboarding game.   Other details in the graphics department add to the effect, but not to the same degree. The snowy backgrounds are glossy white, but at times you feel like you're snowboarding on a blue screen background. Yep, sometimes, you feel like you're not quite really in the background. It's quite surreal. The backgrounds are quite bland, with similarly textures rocky backgrounds, very plain mountains and mounds. The trees are cross sprites, and the houses, ski lifts, and obstacles all look smooth are all sort of smooth, polygonal, and generic. The work appears to have been placed squarely on the body models and their movement and realism, not the backgrounds.   One of the best aspects of the game is the presentation. The rides, the runs and all of the replays are incredibly well done. The replays are actually quite astonishing. Cameras are seemingly placed all over the landscape, from close up and low on the ground, to way atop trees and from top-down perspectives. The front end of this game is also streamlined and straightforward, well designed for the most part, occasionally confusing, but generally very functional. Overall, ESPN Winter X Games Snowboarding is a finely polished realistic snowboarder.   Sound Another fine aspect is the sound and sound quality. The bands, which appear to be a dime a dozen in the alternative, adrenaline-pumping extreme sports genre, don't bug me as much as other games, for some reason of another. Here's the list of songs and who they're performed by: Every Day by Strung Out, I'm Down from the Goldfinger album Stomping Ground, Loose by Primer 55, Ben by Fenix TX, My Life Story by MXPX, Smartbomb by bt, and Dear Kate by Dynamite Hack.   Overall, the sound effects are solid and believable. Tearing through the snow you hear the little white beads and flakes ripple across the bottom of your board. In the halfpipe competitions the crowd cheers your best moves, and ~aaawwhhsss~ your mistakes. I haven't heard any boos yet, but that would have been kinda nice. ESPN Winter X Games Snowboarding is a great looking game that gets loads of extra points for stellar presentation and tons of game modes. The music and sound effects are good, and the overall feel of the game is a mixture of super smooth riding and slightly weird mechanics. I had a hard time figuring out how to play this game before I looked at the manual. Typical dopey console gamer move, but hey, everybody does it once in a while. Still, even after gleaning the manual getting used to the controls and the slightly awkward feel of the snowboarder took longer than I enjoyed. There are lots of little things that I might get used to, but that just slowly turned me off about the game's mechanics. And that's the crux of any extreme game.", "date": "Oct 25, 2000"}
