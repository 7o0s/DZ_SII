Do they ever take one look at a game like Undercover AD2025 Kei, and say ~This is the biggest piece of elephant crap I've ever seen. I can't believe you're actually submitting this for approval. Are you sure you didn't accidentally give us a pre-alpha build of the game? This looks like a Z-budget shareware title from a bunch of retarded fifth-graders.~  The fact that a game like Undercover can ship without being mercy-killed is a testament to the lack of quality control at Japanese companies. The designers  and I do use that term lightly  at Pulse Interactive have produced one of the most insulting ~action games~ since the Genesis port of Time Killers.  But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Undercover is an action-adventure game that puts you into the oh-so-tight miniskirt of Kei, a futuristic Caucasian police-babe. Kei and her hunky partner are tossed into action during the opening cutscene, as a high-class hotel finds itself under siege by gun-toting bad guys who also carry big sticks. Kei races to the scene, ready to tackle the terrorist threat with her remarkably good looks.  The first five seconds of Undercover's gameplay are painful enough to make you never want to touch it again. Imagine Syphon Filter, without the ability to turn left or right while you're walking. Undercover is unquestionably home to the worst player control I've ever experienced in an action game, and the simple act of walking around  let alone shooting anything  is a challenge in itself.  The unbearable control is accompanied by a shoddy camera system that does a fantastic job of keeping you from seeing the bad guys. Lord knows how many times you'll be killed by off-screen enemies  and you won't be able to do squat, thanks to the fatally fiddly controls. Our recommendation is to switch to the Quake-style first-person view mode whenever possible  while you don't get the opportunity to check out Kei's meticulously rendered butt from this perspective, the game's a wee bit more playable.  It seems that Undercover wants to be Resident Evil: Code Veronica, with a blend of gun combat and environment-based puzzle-solving. Unfortunately, the combat portion of things is handled extremely poorly. Though Kei tries to auto-target her closest foe (a definite plus when it comes to fighting off-screen thugs), her shots will occasionally miss for no apparent reason, as the game's engine has a problem calculating straight lines through the 3D environments. Also, if you get too close to a shotgun-wielding gangster, the polygons of his weapon will clip right through Kei's chest, and his shots cause no harm whatsoever. The concept of artificial ~intelligence~ is used lightly here, and you'll laugh in pity at enemies who courteously shoot each other, or stick-holding baddies that stand in one spot and blindly swing at the air in front of them.  At the very least, you can see that the designers had a few good ideas at the basic design  stage  holding a gun on an enemy may cause them to surrender and drop a health pack. (Bizarrely enough, these enemies seem to turn into 'ghosts' after they give up  Kei is able to walk straight through them.) You can play the game like Metal Gear Solid in some locations, hiding under air ducts and hopping out to whack bad guys in the crotch with your nightstick.. Sadly, the execution is pretty godawful with the sub-standard control, and there's barely any point in trying.  The obvious lack of polish and playtesting in Undercover is pretty insulting. When you select a weapon from the inventory screen, Kei appears to pull it directly out of her butt (ouch!). There's also a fascinating level-of-detail bug where players' noses are cut off when they get too far away from the camera (double ouch!). To add insult to injury, most of the textures are horribly misaligned, and the designers' concept of facial animation includes waggling eyebrows and drunkenly bobbing heads. I can go on and on, but you probably get the point by now.  Despite my initial urges to rip Undercover out of my Dreamcast, cover it with kerosene, and torch that mofo with a blowtorch, I continued to play in hopes that it would get better. It never did. Through a combination of unbearable control, incompetent camera angles, and art-school-dropout graphics, Undercover is one of the most appalling titles to surface on our favorite game system. Cancel any plans you might have had regarding importing this game, and put the cash towards Code Veronica instead. Claire Redfield may not have all the sexy curves of Kei, but at least she knows how to fire a gun.  --Colin ~Mr. Angry Eyes~ Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "Feb 3, 2000"}
