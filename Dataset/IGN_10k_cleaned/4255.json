The eponymous hero wreaked bloody vengeance upon the corporation responsible for the murders of his wife and daughter, but Max was painted as a hero thanks to a powerful man named Alfred Woden, the head of an inner circle of Illuminati-type power players. Yet although Max found some closure, the years have not been kind. He is still a haunted man, now living in a hole-in-the-wall, run-down apartment and back to working for the NYPD. He thinks his past is behind him when he responds to a police dispatch regarding shots fired at an old warehouse. Unfortunately, he couldn't be more wrong, and he will end up tumbling through another long rabbit hole into a Wonderland of mayhem and drama at least equal to what he waded through many years before. Along for the ride are our old friends Chief Bravura, Vladimir Lem, Vinnie Gognitti, Mona Sax, and a couple others, but I don't want to give too much away.   You'll notice some immediate improvements over the original as the scene opens at a city hospital. Close-ups of faces are remarkably realistic. A lot of animation has been motion-captured. You can knock things over like chairs, stools, boxes. Puddles of water give accurate reflections of their surroundings. People have funny conversations.   Your first firefight will be different as well, thanks to some adjustments in Bullet Time. You'll still be able to do those slow-mo shoot-dives, but you can actually stay on the ground until you've stopped firing. This move doesn't use up any of your Bullet Time energy either, so it's being offered as a basic technique you should be using quite often. There's another separate button that will put you in the new Bullet Time, and with each kill during this phase, your enemies become slower, until you can easily dodge bullets at medium range. It doesn't last for very long, but it's enough to get you through some tough spots, especially when a van pulls out in front of you and spills out more people than even Rambo could handle. You still get a boost in your hourglass when you take someone down, but the meter also gradually refills while you're not using that mode. Also, the slow-motion dives don't use up the meter.   If this makes things sound too easy, well, let me tell you, these guys are quick on the draw and very rarely travel alone. Plus they will all be wearing body armor eventually, forcing you to aim right at their heads if you want to take out two or three people in one dive. Once you've finished a dive and are getting back to your feet, they better be dead, or you'll get a deadly lead salad before you've gotten all the way back up. Thankfully, the new Bullet Time mode also gifts you with rapid reload, which you will perform with a dramatic whirl and a swooping camera. It's pretty cool.    In bringing Max Payne from PC to the console, a little auto-aiming was necessary and unfortunately this is one of the shortcomings of the game. While we wouldn't expect any expert gamers to do this, we've noticed novices with no prior experience taking out enemies in a doorway while Max was standing in the middle of a medium sized roomshooting at the ceiling. With a shotgun in Max's hand, the game is even more generous. We understand there has to be some sacrifices when you go from the mouse-and-keyboard control the game was designed for to the dual analog sticks of a PS2 or Xbox, but on the default difficulty it's a little ridiculous.     There are some interesting changes in the arsenal, speaking of which. The grenade launcher is gone, but you now have the MP5, a versatile assault rifle with a short-range scope. There are so many fully automatic weapons, though, that a few get lost in the shuffle. You have the Ingrams, three assault rifles, and two machine guns. You'll forget the Ingram ever existed once you start wielding the Kalashnikov AK-47. Each round does some vicious damage, and you can cut someone down with only a couple bullets if you aim right. But they can also cut you down with it too. Since many of the bad guys camp positions waiting for you to appear, you'll find yourself enabling Bullet Time before bursting through a lot of doors. Save often, folks. Although AI difficulty adjusts somewhat to your skill level, an AK is an AK and it's hard to not put some serious hurt on someone. Another nice tweak is dual Desert Eagles. I didn't use the single style Desert Eagle in the first game much, because of its slow rate of fire and smaller clip. Here, though, they pack a satisfying punch that, in combination with some Bullet Time, will allow you to put some hurt on a much better armed enemy. Plus, with the 2.0 mode, you get those wicked-fast reloads.   You may have noticed that I didn't specify Max when I mentioned all the things you can do in the game. That's because you'll actually get to play Mona Sax, the femme fatale contract killer from the original game who survived a bullet wound to her head and resurfaces early once you start digging around what was going on in that warehouse. Playing her is almost the same experience, except she has a Dragunov sniper rifle she'll be putting to heavy use about midway through the game. I don't want to give too much away, but it was probably the most tense and exciting segment in the game.    Their star-crossed love story plays a major part in the game, and pulls Max Payne 2 head and shoulders above the action game style. Combine that with Max's own haunted past, and you have a story that stands on its own in terms of drama. From what you know about the story in the original Max Payne, it's clear that Mona Sax is probably the only woman who could break through Max's shell of loss and heartache. She's like him--violent and lost, but a soul struggling back onto a better path. Max can identify with this, and lets her in.   However, this is a crime story, a mystery of sorts, and Max Payne 2 brims with a cascade of revelations about who these people are that you think you knew from the first game. Some of those revelations are pretty Shakespearean. And since Max Payne 2 opens with an alarming but obscured montage of death, you don't know who is going to make it out alive, who the red herrings are, and what will become of Mr. Payne himself, and this veil doesn't fall away until the very end. Along the way, Max will struggle with his alliances, his enemies and himself before he finally finds freedom.   If there's any downside to the game, it's the length. I managed to mow my way through in less than a dozen hours, and many have claimed finishing it in less than half that time. It's in three parts this time, and a few of the chapters are just comic book panel vignettes bookended with in-game cutscenes. But you really should stop and smell the roses. There are some long overheard conversations really worth hearing through to the end, especially at the police station. The TV shows are worth lingering for as well, and you'll have a bunch of answering machine messages you can go through. There are a few dream sequences, but, thank God, they don't involve any instant-death jump puzzles or aggravating, endless mazes. Instead, the dreams illustrate the mind of Max Payne, the world inside his head. These are strange, often disturbing segments, but they are very engrossing and illuminating.   The physics system of MP2 is outstanding. Knocking over objects on tables, breaking apart benches and collapsing scaffolding are the sorts of things you'll be encountering throughout the game and they do quite a bit to ground the whole experience. In combat, bodies go flying, tumble brutally down stairwells, and go flying off precipices with satisfying realism. A particularly good hit will give you a slow-mo rotating camera close-up of the bad guy getting flung back by the killing shot, but this feature is used sparingly enough so that it never feels like a gimmick. There's also some partial map destructibility--you'll actually have to blow some stuff up in order to make progress towards your destination, but keep clear of the explosives when you do. There's a lot more explosive stuff lying around than in the first game, so you can use that to your advantage when a bad guy decides to duck behind a stack of ammo boxes. You can even set off a chain of explosions that will clear out an entire room. You'll also have a couple more ~get out of the burning building~ areas, but they aren't nearly as frustratingly difficult as the restaurant back in the first Max Payne, which was loaded with a string of explosives that made it impossible to linger in a single room for more than a couple seconds.     There also some unnecessarily tough spots, even in the standard difficulty mode. Early on, you have to rescue an old friend from a horde of mobsters, and you'll have to clear out a wave of about a dozen of them before the game allows you to progress. They come from all angles and pack some serious heat. Also, the final fight is particularly troublesome, even after you've figured out how to defeat this last guy. Your only clue on how to get past him is in the title of that chapter, and it's a vague clue at that. Thankfully though, there is nothing like what you experienced when entering the high-rise office building near the first Max Payne, when several people at multiple elevations were firing some suspiciously accurate and long-range rocket grenades.    In fact, there are no rockets or grenade launchers at all in Max Payne 2. However, the enemy AI is handier with grenades and Molotov cocktails this time around. But they're not completely competent and will sometimes blow themselves up with a bad throw, or they won't run away when you throw one at them from a sufficient distance. For the most part, you will be dealing with quantity over quality, and they will be no match for your Bullet Time. They are still whip-fast, though, so you won't be able to go in guns blazing and expect to come out without a scratch. Thankfully, they will randomly drop painkillers, unlike the first game. You'll never be without some of those for too long--but you won't be walking around smugly with a full load of them for too long either. Damn that AK-47!   Graphics   Max Payne 2 looks significantly better than its predecessor with nicer looking textures all over the place. Max's grill no longer looks like an un-restored oil painting of a grimacing Christian Slater. In cutscenes the camera simply gets up close on the in-game characters and you can see slight facial animations and whatnot. The downside to the game's look comes from the fact that there aren't very many polygons being thrown around in the game. It seems that the physics system and the demands of bullet time but a limit on just how intricate complicated the structures and characters can be.    You'll notice that Max himself looks very similar to the old Max, but with a new mug, outstanding new texture work on his jacket and outfit he's like a whole new psychotic, yet sympathetic rogue cop. Like the No Named Thug's jacket in Grand Theft Auto III for the Xbox, Max's leather shines and has folds --even if they don't move-- this time around so that it looks like he's wearing an article of clothing instead of a merely having a jacket texture sprayed on. Through most of the cutscenes you'll get some close-up looks at many of the main characters who are more lifelike than the ones in the original Max Payne, but still a little too blocky and lifeless compared to what we've seen in console games like Metal Gear Solid 2.

Links :: Video Review Get the Guide ::    The lighting in the game is well done as are the weapon effects. We especially like the wispy, life-like flames that are scattered throughout the game. Whether it's a burning building, one of those dangerous exploding red barrels that have terrorized gamers for more than a decade or the barrel of a pistol spitting out hot lead, fire in Max Payne 2 is very impressive. All of those screenshots turned out to be legit after all.   Sound   The use of sound in Max Payne 2 is one of the underrated strengths of the game and it does plenty to keep the mood dark and interesting. You have to listen while playing this game so you can uncover clues about what's going to happen to Max, how the plot is twisting and turning and in some cases what the hell you're supposed to do to advance. The developers at Remedy made it super easy to skip cutscenes and you can walk away from televisions and conversations at any time, but you're really missing half of the game if you do.    The voice-acting does a lot to carry the game with characters like Max and Mona shining through despite their less than stunning visual representatives. Payne's voice is usually nothing more than a low steady hum with a few consonant sounds thrown in and he sounds like a guy that hasn't felt happiness in a long time. The New York accents and Russian accents are right inline with what you might expect from a big budget action movie.    The surround sound is very good. You get great directional sound so that a conversation on the other side of a door --there will plenty of these-- will be coming from a direction relative to the camera. If you're swinging the camera around the conversation you're eavesdropping on will swing around as well through all of the speakers in your 5.1 set up. When you slip into and out of Bullet Time, the audio of the scene slows down as well so reports from weapon fire, sirens and even yelling will be slowed down to a crawl like you're playing a 45 at 33 1/3. Very nice. Sometimes the audio will glitch up and skip all together when you get too many audio sources running into each other. Entering and leaving rooms on top of weapons fire, on top of dialogue coming over a loudspeaker or Max's headset will cause things to get a little ugly but for the most part the sound in Max Payne is very effective.   If you didn't like the first one, there's probably nothing new or different enough to pull you in this time. The love story adds some dramatic depth to Max's haunting story, and somehow makes what's going on more important and interesting. Wreaking havoc is nice, but it's great to also have a love interest complicating things, and Mona Sax is definitely up to the task. The visuals are excellent, the voice work is superior to what we usually get dealt in the action genre, and I only wish the game was a bit longer. A lot longer actually, but it's more because this kind of game is such a rare find than because that find is relatively meager.", "date": "Nov 25, 2003"}
