{"name": "Ridge Racer 6", "name_review": "Ridge Racer 6", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/11/21/ridge-racer-6", "text": "Ridge Racer 6 is so much of an arcade game that it should come packaged with a limited-edition Xbox 360 faceplate into which you insert quarters. Fans of Namco's drift-racing series already expect this from the next-generation title and shouldn't be disappointed. RR6 retains the core gameplay and style that made the original a hit way back on the Playstation.   Simulation-racing fans, however, will be put off by the impossible physics of drifting around corners while juiced up on nitrous. Moreover, the lack of licensed cars, real-life locales and the ability to tweak out your ride puts the Ridge Racer series in danger of becoming stagnant. If you're simply looking for a pick-up-and-play racer that will blow your hair back, then RR6 is worth a look.    Drifting is back and more unrealistic than ever. If you've played the PSP version, you know how it works. Basically, you accelerate into a turn, as soon as you feel yourself losing control of the car, you let up on the gas, and your car will magically begin to slide with the turn, as if the concrete highway just morphed into a hockey rink. To end the slide, simply steer out of the turn and accelerate on your merry way.    That dinosaur isn't the only unrealistic aspect of this game. Drifting pretty much eliminates the need for the brake button. Sliding through a turn is obviously much faster than slowing down to avoid the wall, and usually it's fun -- it's also the defining feature of Ridge Racer in general. Unfortunately, drifting feels a little overdone and you will often lose control of your car when you are just trying to straighten out. This forces you into a monotonous kind of racing: hold down the gas; let off the accelerator and drift through a turn; repeat.    When you drift, you magically build up the nitrous meter, new to the Ridge Racer series. For reasons you aren't going to like, the nitrous feature works. The meter is split into three levels, with level two and three burning longer and accelerating you faster than the first level. The reason why nitrous seems cool is that RR6 feels slow, even when burning the first-level nitrous. Only when you unleash nitrous level two or three do you get the sense of speed made famous in games like Burnout 3. Even when you reach the top speed of class four cars, upward of 195 mph, you still feel a bit sluggish as the scenery casually slips by.     As far as the actual racing goes, RR6 feels like one of those racing games in which you continually race against the clock instead of the actual opponents. In a 14-car race, never will an opponent crash into the wall or bottle up traffic. Instead, you will make your way from the back of the pack, overtaking opponents until you eventually take the lead, which only happens on the last lap if you've ran a nearly perfect race. There's a noticeable lack of rubbing. Opponents don't try and cut you off or try to prevent you from passing. RR6 is all about driving fast and avoiding the wall. Take first place and win a free race. Finish second and play another quarter.   On the track, there are no collision animations, nor do the cars take damage of any kind. Namco expressed the desire to focus the game on speed and racing and didn't want you to have your car slowed down by a simple fender bender. RR6 6 is a racer, they say, not a destruction derby. Still, early on you will be in the wall, assuming you haven't yet mastered the drift technique, and it would be a welcome addition to see some rearview mirrors explode to bits every now and again.   Nitrous: welcome addition or just laughing gas? You decide. The fictional cars are divided into four classes, each faster than the next. Within each class, the cars are divided into drift types: mild, standard and dynamic. Other than that the differences between vehicles are cosmetic. As far as upgrading your cars in the garage, you can only unlock new paint jobs -- a big disappointment for fans of tinkering with custom made, individualized cars. Ridge Racer has never claimed to be a deep game, but some kind of upgrade system would have been a nice touch.    RR6 attempts to make up for this feature with unlockable cars, of which there are more than 100, but as the differences are, again, cosmetic, there's not much for gear heads to look forward too. The special class, which is basically a fifth and faster class, is loaded with funky, futuristic designs like hovercrafts, a car that stands on four legs and even a flying saucer piloted by Pac-Man. And don't fret about our yellow friend -- he still is playable in the opening load screen.   As a simple arcade racer, RR6 can only hope to complete with the big boys like Project Gotham Racing 3 with awesome visuals. Sadly, they are a let down. While the sky typically is colorful and vibrant, the surrounding trees, grass and rocks look like something you could find on the original Xbox. Rock looks especially terrible, like a mass of patterned, brown nothingness. Some courses are plain disappointing in their blandness. Rave City, which should be a wild party of neon as the name suggests, looks like an industrial park on a Tuesday night. The windows are all the same boring color, the color palette a dull combination of blue and green. If Namco isn't going to give us real-world locales, then the 15 fictional courses and their mirrors should blow our minds. Instead, they disappoint. At least RR6 runs smoothly at 60 frames per second, but that's expected these days.     Lighting is a mixed bag compared with some of the other racers out there. The reflections on the cars are probably the best out there, better than even PGR3. But during night races, headlights have absolutely no lighting effect on the cars whatsoever. In fact, other than the minor reflections of the scenery on the roof of the car, there are no lighting or shading effects at all, not even when you are driving on a dark road and enter a bright tunnel. The lights in the tunnel show a reflection, but the screen, or the car for that matter, don't brighten up at all, as they should.   The sound is vintage Ridge Racer with a techno infused soundtrack. There's also a ridiculous sounding announcer that Namco calls the DJ. He's like a poor-man's NBA Street announcer and is always mentioning that I set a new track-record even though I'm in ninth place. Frankly, I think the other eight guys may have that record. Thankfully you can turn the DJ off, just like I did after two races.    World Xplorer is the single-player mode and is a bit of a misnomer since you race the same 15 tracks and their mirrors over and over again. The only things that change in this network of more than 200 races is the difficulty level and the class of car you drive. In order to unlock all the special cars, you must win all 200-plus of these races, but sadly, with the same old tracks, it's a small world, after all.   As for online play, there are the standard online unranked and ranked races against a maximum of 13 other players. You can also reserve private slots for your friends. Perhaps the coolest online feature is the Global Time Attack in which you can upload your best races to a worldwide leader board. From there, others can download your ghost car and try to beat your time. This will probably prove even more addicting than the 14-player matches because racers can claim ultimate glory by topping thousands of other racers in a virtual time trial. Namco also promises downloadable content like additional vehicles to be available later this year. Despite its flaws, RR6 will be a hit with Ridge Racer fans and will probably draw a small crowd of simulation fans that are looking for a brief respite from the real world of Project Gotham 3. The cars look splendid but the lighting is poor and the backgrounds are pretty dull, many of them ripped from the PSP Ridge Racer. The Global Time Attack with downloadable ghost cars and the leader boards is a step in a great direction for the series, as you can only have so much fun playing by yourself. As always with Ridge Racer, it's really a love-it-or-hate-it relationship with the drifting technique as basic physics -- and reality, for that matter -- are pretty much thrown out the window. Isaac Newton would choke on his apple if he saw this game. For what RR6 is trying to do, it succeeds -- it's just not trying to do too much.", "date": "Nov 21, 2005"}
