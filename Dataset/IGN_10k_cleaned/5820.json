They have to add on as many options as possible to make conflict appear realistic.  At the same time, they must develop an AI capable of absorbing all the game's built-in complexities, and stand up to that weasliest of entities, the human brain.  It stands to reason that the more complex the title gets, the more difficult it is to build an adequate AI.  SR2010 is the most complex strategic war game I've played in some respects; and sure enough, it suffers from AI problems and some design flaws.  But there's enough gameplay here to redeem the faults in singleplayer mode, and to turn the multiplayer experience into a completely absorbing one.   First Impressions  You begin by selecting singleplayer or multiplayer mode.  (The latter supports up to 16 LAN or Web-based players.)  If you select singleplayer, you next choose a scenario (selecting a map, your own nation and a victory condition), a mission (a map, nation and its victory condition is already pre-selected for you) or a campaign (a series of linked missions of increasing difficulty).  The game comes with nine missions out of the box and several dozen scenarios and campaigns.  Most of them are regional maps: all of the northwestern US, for instance, or just New York state, split among three warring factions.  You can pick any side to play in any of these.  After launching your selection, you receive an email containing customized advice from your Minister of State regarding your domestic situation relations with your neighbors: whom you should placate, and whom you might attack.   Graphically, SR2010 is adequate for its purpose.  The screen displays a top down view appropriate to your chosen scenario, mission or campaign.  Superimposed on the topological display are city names, and individual tokens representing cities military units, and industrial complexes.  Clicking on a token displays relevant information in reassuring detail.  Click a city, and you're given a list of all your cities by population, location, and loyalty, with the one you chose, highlighted.  Click a military token, and you get a complete breakdown its values: initiative, speed, weight, cargo, personnel, type of weaponry carried and amount, spotting strength, etc.  Click an industrial token, and you get a list of the industries present, along with capacity, production, demand, stock, raw materials usage, consumption details, activity, etc.  Each of these display panels is large enough to contain all the information it presents without clutter.  In addition, there are numerous icons on the industrial and military unit panels, allowing further actions to be taken with that unit.  Do you want to scrap or upgrade an industrial facility?  Move a tank battalion into the reserves?  You can do all that and more, easily enough.       Along the top you'll find your approval rating, treasury, region name, flag, the timer, and the game menu.  (You can also bring up the latter at any time by hitting ESC.)  All the other commands affecting your government perform as sliding panels from the left and right borders of the screen.  The bottom right hand side of the screen slides in a list of current email reports, from which you can read one by clicking.  It flashes when a new email has arrived.  The left is far more crowded; and I have to wonder whether it wouldn't have been better to move help, speed controls, World Market News and terrain information to the right hand side.  Be that as it may, the rest of the left border represents all your interactions with the various departments of your government: Strategic Operations, Defense, State and Treasury and Commerce Departments, and the Department of the Interior (which contains social spending and research).     Clicking on a department slides out a box with basic relevant information, including a series of icons that launch more specific information boxes.  Most of these second tier boxes in turn offer icons thatyes, that's right.  Up to three tiers.  So the basic Department of the Interior box tells you at a glance the annual cost of all your current social spending, the recommendations of your minister, your domestic approval, cultural approval, annual R&D budget, research efficiency, tech level, and net annual migration.  If you click the icon for Social Services Investment, a panel slides into view with eight icons representing all your social service areas.  When you click one of those, a new panel supplies a quality rating for it, annual and recommended investment, and a slider that lets you to change the investment level.    If the sheer number of units under view on the main screen is daunting, you can use your mouse wheel to move in for a closer look.  Alternatively, you can move out, and get a better sense of the overall picture in the region.  You can slide the mouse anywhere on your selected map as well, though areas you don't control are darker to reflect your lack of accurate information.     I have to say that I like both the organization of SR2010's menu system, its selection of icons, and its uniformity of execution.  It's easy to find what you need, and the help system gives you a handy guide to associated key combinations if you don't want to mouse over everything.   Wealth of Detail  You probably get a hint of the real drill-down depth of SR2010 from my introductory comments.  Would you like to control the production and upgrading of facilities designed to produce eleven separate commodities, that your people can consume, or you can sell?  Replace your Treasury Minister with any of 35 other potential candidates, rated for general political views, as well as their expertise in a variety of fields?  Do you want to approach the World Market (SR2010's equivalent of the UN, focusing entirely on economic and military support) for pricing subsidies, or loan forgiveness?  Put together a diplomatic offer involving treaties, consumer goods, military units, unit designs, research, cash, land, and/or missiles?  Build air units capable electronic counter measures, sub detection, mid-air refueling, or short-deck landings?  It's all here, and a lot more.   This level of detail extends to the military, as well.  There are a ton of military units in SR2010: easily more than 400, rated for supplies, strength, fuel, missiles, movement speed, spotting range, travel range, stealth, eight forms of attack, four forms of defense, efficiency, cargo, combat time, and entrenchment, initiative, manufacturing cost, required technologies, etc; and this doesn't even take into account special unit features, like mine-laying.  The visuals aren't going to impress anybody, but then, this is a strategic game, not a tactical one played with animated sprites.  Armchair generals are going to salivate over the range of units and the obliging way SR2010 handles all the calculations behind the scenes.   Taking all this in at once can be difficult.  Fortunately, the developers prepared an in-depth manual.  (The readme file is essential, though.  The manual was slightly out-of-date by the time the game was released, and a few features were removed or added.)  They also supplied a series of solid in-game tutorials that explain the operation of each ministry under your command, and the way the interface works.     But if you don't want to make all those in-depth decisions, SR2010 allows department ministers to handle their respective portfolios for you.  When juggling finances isn't your idea of a good time, your selections from a list of priorities allows ministers to work towards your goals.  For instance, the Treasury Minister can be told to concentrate on any of 20 priorities, including Minimizing Taxation, Increasing Revenue, Decreasing Spending, Increasing Treasury, Foreign Investment, Improving the GDP, and Low Income Tax Relief.  (Each priority is listed with its pros and cons, obligingly enough.)  You can select multiple priorities, as well, though it's wise to make certain first that they don't contradict one another, or your minister will do the best they can to reconcile your competing goals.  This can also happen between ministerial departments.  Assuming your Defense Minister has been directed to prioritize Military Buildup and your Treasury Minister has been instructed to Decrease Spending at the same time, the money simply won't be available to build all those shiny new toys you want to aim at your neighbors.  You have the option as well of taking over aspects of a specific department, locking a minister out of a subset of decisions; so assuming you don't fancy allowing your Treasury Minister to manage the bond market, you can keep that to yourself allow him or her to carry on, elsewhere.   It Isn't All There  We have a game with a really rich set of tools, diplomatic, economic, and military.  It's all offered to you in a well-organized, attractive fashion.  But that's when design problems start to appear.   First, diplomacy is under-utilized in the game.  The AI behind other national leaders doesn't understand its strategic implications.  It has no idea that diplomacy is a tool of war, just as military power in reserve can be an effective tool of peace.  In the South American scenario, for example, Brazil is powerful, hated, and entertains expansionist ambitions, but the other nations concentrate on piecemeal attacks without allies; or having made alliances, they don't often honor them, after an invasion.  The AI is apt to turn down good diplomatic offers even when it views you as fairly friendly; it will turn you down cold if it doesn't like you, despite offering it a large range of items in exchange for paltry pickings.  It also acts foolishly after its forces have been decimated.  I've taken over all but a tiny section of a region and demanded nothing more than the surrender of a single, small province, only to be flatly turned down every time.  This is extremely unrealistic behavior.    I suspect Battlegoat's designers would claim that all this lack of diplomacy is realistic in the context of the 2010 world they've created, where nearly every nation loathes every other one.  But this has the feeling of being a workaround to dodge the whole issue of diplomatic AI in the standalone game.  Instant hatred at startup all-too-neatly restricts all those deals you could cut, an area where humans clearly have the edge over the AI.  I notice that the 1.2 patch has made the AI a bit more diplomatically responsive, but it's still unrealistically tough to get the enemies of your enemies to be your friends in nearly all scenarios.  Even some of the diplomatic treaties you can establish don't make much sense.  A ~formal alliance~ doesn't appear to operate as one; allies ignore you when you go to war.  Nor do I understand why an ~embassy~ should be considered a treaty you ask for in negotiations, when it's a given that any diplomatic relations, however frosty, can only take place between nations that already possess embassies.     Some of the same caveats affect the economy.  I have so many industrial options for creating and upgrading that I can tweak.  But since no game goes beyond 10 years in playing time and all industries build in realtime, there's really very little I can do with it all.  That's even if you factor out your neighbors immediately declaring war on you and one another as quickly as possible.   AI Problems  In a strategic war game, a strong AI is a must.  This would be the case if you had to do nothing except select units and place them in a formation across the terrain, facing an enemy.  But in a title like SR2010 that simulates so many aspects of national-level control and responsemilitary, economic, and diplomaticgood AI is absolutely essential.  And frankly, the AI here gets a mixed result on its report card.  It does some things very well.  Your ministers implement most priorities effectively (but I'll note some reservations, later).  The enemy military AI understands which units to deploy in any given military situation, and seems adequate at handling terrain.  It tends too often to throw units piecemeal at you, but it exploits weaknesses in geographical defenses ruthlessly.  The developers have said it doesn't cheat in these circumstances, and based on its actions in wartime, I'm prepared to believe that.  When its units have high spotting values, it meets the enemy with a decent strategic response, but when no spotters are present, it can and will make mistakes.     Unfortunately, it often lacks spotters where they're most needed, and this points to a greater issue: the AI currently lacks a good sense of what units to build.  It correctly perceives the importance of investing in units of a certain kind, but then proceeds to add far too many of that specific unit to its army, ignoring other equally pressing needs.  It cannot grasp the variety of units required to make a particular war, waged in a given region, work.  As a result, it is apt to neglect missiles, or tanks, or anything else, once it has set its eyes on whatever is required for the moment.  This applies to your Defense Department AI, as well, as I discovered to my chagrin after leaving my Defense Minister in charge for a while.     The enemy AI is also woefully stupid at determining when it should declare war, and whom it should target.  Insignificant nations sign their death warrants by attacking far larger and better armed ones without a second thought.  I've observed this phenomenon while playing Serbia, Brazil, and Massachusetts:  in all three cases, endless numbers of small, poorly armed neighbors threw themselves to their death against my might.  Suicide may be painless, as the song says, but it's also damned frustrating when it becomes a repetitive feature of intergovernmental relations.  I really wanted to see foreign conduct that was a bit less two-dimensional; powerful Albania arming my neighbors when I was Serbia, for example.  I can't blame other nations for being unable to form joint defense treaties or economic federations, since Battlegoat didn't place multi-party alliances in the game.  But I can blame the other countries in a given scenario for simply not thinking or acting in their best interests.  However you determine that; because it's not in a nation's interest to commit suicide by attacking an incredibly strong rival that can squash it in a few day's boring work.    There are other problems.  The enemy AI also doesn't adapt well to changes you've made when setting victory conditions.  Switching to a diplomatic or economic win is ignored by AI-driven regions, who insist on wearing themselves out by going to war.  The developers would probably reply that this is perfectly in keeping with the chaotic world situation they've created in all their 2010 scenarios, missions and campaigns, but that's begging the question.  Why allow a diplomatic victory condition in all singleplayer games, if the AI isn't equipped to handle this?     Bugs  I'm cutting SR2010 some slack in this area, simply because the game is too complex and deep for everything to work right out of the box, under all given situations.  Still, some issues need to be addressed.  First, there's the matter of your domestic approval rating.  If you're running a democracy (and there are four different governments you can select from, each with its own benefits and drawbacks), you want to have your people like you to encourage reelection.  Even monarchies will want a high DAR, because if your domestic approval rating drops sufficiently, you will see decreased production output, and possibly civilian riots or even breakaway territories.  But it seems nearly impossible in many scenarios to keep this rating high.  Lower taxes, raise social spending, and it will still drop below a danger point without apparent cause.  Winning wars only seems to help momentarily.   Some minister settings also appear to be broken at this point.  I've yet to see a minister build a new industrial structure, even when asked to prioritize making my nation self-sufficient.  My Ministers of State never implement most of their priorities.  Nor have any of my ministers ever complained to me (via email) when their priorities conflict.  This forces me to ride herd over them, which runs counter to the whole reason for AI-driven ministers, in the first place.   I've noticed, too, that some enemy nations rely entirely on the World Market for all their military units, while their economies are in a freefall so bad that I doubt their printed money could double as wallpaper.  This may simply be a way to get around creating a challenge in smaller nations, who become walkovers once you've taken their most industrially productive territories; but if so, it's a bad idea.  It feels like an unrealistic kludge.  Logically, the World Market shouldn't have an infinite number of units to provide, nor should it do so when you appear on the threshold of gobbling up an all but defeated neighbor.  I still think implementing group defensive alliances would have been a more logical way to go.   Finally, although they're not a matter of faulty implementation, some features originally intended for SR2010 never made it in.  Covert ops, they ~dirty tricks~ that remain among my favorite activities in this kind of game, show up in the manual but not in the final release.      My ratings essentially mirror my experiences with SR2010, and both add up to a good game that has some obvious flaws.  If I edge towards the top of that range, using IGNs ratings guide, its because I feel clearly a lot of work went into creating this game.  My criticisms should be taken with this perspective in mind.  Although I have problems with the way a number of things are done, many things are done very well, indeed.  If everything to work in SR2010 as it should, and if the potential length of scenarios was much longer, I think it would rank as a Hall-of-Famer.  Im quite serious, and Ive been playing (and reviewing) them since the mid-1980s.But a lot of work remains to be done, assuming it ever gets done.  In the meantime, SR2010 remains a great muitiplayer title, but a singleplayer one thats alternately exciting and frustrating.  I sincerely hope that Battlegoat Studios works on the AI and gives us more diversified scenarios, in the very near future.", "date": "Jun 15, 2005"}
