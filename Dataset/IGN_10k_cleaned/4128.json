But it's only now that Nintendo has chosen to give the series a chance outside of its Japanese roots. And after playing the Game Boy Advance title released for the first time in North America, I have this to say: what the hell took so long? The game, a turn-based strategy game designed by the same group of folks that brought the Advance Wars franchise to the GBA system, is an excellent mixture of RPG and adventure elements in a wonderfully told fantasy tale, and it's decidedly different from the past two strategy games already available from the developer. It's definitely one of, if not the most elaborate game developments on the handheld released this year, and it could definitely change the minds of those who don't favor that growingly popular ~strategy~ thing. Features Dozens of campaigns and side-quests Three cartridge slots Link support for four players (multiple cartridge)  At first glance it's clear that Fire Emblem has been developed by the same production company that worked on the Advance Wars series, and after two games in the series (with a sequel that was more an update than a new game), it wouldn't be surprising if there were a few hold-outs afraid of getting ~yet another Advance Wars~ too soon after the last game's release. Apart from the similar tactical interface and basic ~turn-based~ design, Fire Emblem is a much different game with a strategy focus on a different level than the Advance Wars series. Fire Emblem, like any good strategy game, features an extended tutorial mode that explains the nuances of the turn-based gameplay. This tutorial is integrated into a storyline, and the game itself puts players in the role of an overseeing tactician, helping a group of adventurers on their way to a task written in the game's script. On the way, players will be ambushed by enemy forces, and it's here where the player must maneuver the members and have them take out enemy troops using each of the unit's different abilities of weapon and magic attacks and counter-attacks. Early in the game players will learn the key elements of Fire Emblem's strategy and gameplay. Like positioning troops in woods or mountains to protect them from attacks, or learning about the ~fog of war~ or how rain affects movement during a player's turn. And even though the game's not an RPG per se, it features some specific elements in that genre...most notably the ability to ~level up~ units with more experience in combat.   The important basics, though, involve what's known as the ~rules of three.~ The ~weapon triangle~ is an easy to grasp concept that's similar to rock/paper/scissors: there are three types of combat weaponry in Fire Emblem, each type having a strength against one, and a weakness against another. Members who utilize swords, for example, have an advantage over enemies that wield axes, but are weak against lances. Magic has a similar rule in its Trinity of Magic, where light dominates dark, but is lousy against ~anima.~ Knowing this ~rule of threes~ is important in the success of winning the game's campaigns, because losing a member of your party can be a real bitch.  See, unlike Advance Wars's focus on nameless troops to command, the party members in Fire Emblem are individual personalities, and as such, if they perish during a mission, they're done. For good. And it's this that gives the game it's own unique flair over the modernized take of Advance Wars, since players can no longer depend on the strategy of ~make more troops~ when one gets defeated in combat. Once a member is taken out, if the game continues as is, those units will never be able to participate in future missions. There are exceptions to the rules: for example, the game's first nine chapters are considered ~training,~ so any character who dies in these missions won't participate in any future training missions...but they'll show up in future parts of the story after training as if nothing ever happened to them. Also, if the characters deemed integral to the storyline perish during combat, such as Lyndis during the training and Eliwood or his cohorts after training, the mission ends with a final ~game over.~ At which the mission must be restarted completely. It's up to the player's discretion if they want to keep playing without one of the other troops...but generally speaking the attachment to specific members of the party is too great to let one go. Forever. And that's what gives Fire Emblem a different level of strategy...and a unique feeling of emotion not usually felt in videogames.    Since a lot of the time specific characters are important to the linear storyline, when a unit ~dies~ in combat, they don't really perish...they ~retreat~ and sit on the sidelines. These characters will hang out with the troop, just so they can show up in the already-scripted cutscenes. This is the only weak part of Fire Emblem, but then, it would take an incredibly complex branching script if it had to keep up with all the characters who get killed during the mission. But at the very least, Fire Emblem needs a master list of who's in the player's troop but unusable...as is, it only tells players who's an active fighter. The appearance of these ~dead~ (read: unusable) characters in cutscenes is just a tad confusing. And annoying.   The game also has a unique feature that saves the game to cartridge after every single turn made, either by the player or the computer. This makes Fire Emblem extremely handheld friendly since players can simply turn off the system at any point in the action, and depend on having that point in the game return upon power-up. This might be a turn-off to some who have grown accustomed to saving during a particularly nasty point in the game...and if things don't go their way they can just quit and restart in that mission. That can't be done here. It definitely ensures that every move you make counts...even a potentially hazardous goof-up, like accidentally telling a party member to stay put instead of moving him out of harm's way, can't be fixed with a quick reset. Personally, I think this adds to the experience since it requires a careful mind for its strategy and gameplay.  Luckily, there's a lot of rewarding ~exploration~ during the game's different missions. Not only will specific characters join your cause as the story goes on, you can also acquire new members by taking advantage of optional side-quests and searching out the map. Side-quests are not a requirement to play, but they're greatly encouraged since players can drastically increase their arsenal by joining one. In any mission, players can send a troop to ~visit~ buildings or towns that will award additional weapons or items...or even brand new troops to join the cause. And these are more prominent in the side-quests, which will definitely help players build up their troops for the standard quests as well as the multiplayer modes.  One of the things that made Advance Wars one of the greatest Game Boy Advance games was its attention to multiplayer. Strangely, even though both it and Fire Emblem share elements, Fire Emblem's multiplayer feature falls just a tad short. Instead of pitting player against player on a map, it's more of a game of chess where players create a team out of their current campaign's members, and one by one pit an individual unit against another player's unit and score points depending on the result against the two. As fun as this mode is, it's just not the same as commanding troops in a series of multiplayer maps.   But Fire Emblem's single player campaign is far more established than Advance Wars and excellently written. The localization team did a wonderful job giving each character his or her own unique personality in the pages upon pages of text that unfolds the storyline. And in terms of presentation, Fire Emblem has it in spades, with an outstanding audio soundtrack (including the operatic introduction) and stunning battle animations for each of the different units in the game. As much as I really enjoyed Advance Wars, I was a little disappointed that the sequel didn't do much but give players more of the same game design. Fire Emblem, however, is not a rehash of Advance Wars. It may share some similarities with the war game, but this fantasy-based design plays entirely different with new levels of strategy not found in Intelligent System's previous strategy design. The single player quest is incredibly challenging and fulfilling, but the decent multiplayer mode doesn't quite reach what the team did for the Advance Wars series. A small gripe for an otherwise outstanding, satisfying Game Boy Advance design.", "date": "Nov 6, 2003"}
