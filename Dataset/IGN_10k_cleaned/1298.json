In addition to blasphemous dental hygiene, they're also known for an eternally warped sense of humor. The proof is in the pudding, e.g. Monty Python, Who's Line Is It Anyway, Mr. Bean (shudder), etc.  And, of course, that adorably ancient Amiga title cum multi-platform sensation, Worms. Still, when publisher Ocean was absorbed into the overinflated Infogrames corporate umbrella, the fate of the cantankerous invertebrates (whose ultraviolent antics were even more hilarious than those of the Gallagher brothers) was uncertain.  Lucky for us the little buggers weren't benched.  Instead they've been reincarnated as boisterous swine. In short, they've been ~redeemed.~   Gameplay Hogs of War, not to be confused with TalonSoft's Dogs of War (an equally laughable attempt at realtime strategy) is all about cheap rib ticklers. Or, to be precisely accurate, it's about tactical challenge spliced with audio-visual gags. Frankly, though it features a bunch of overgrown 3D porkers on large scale battlefields, this title's an unapologetic clo.. er, spin-off of Worms. Translated into the vernacular, that means the title's an addictive, but ultimately annoying, mix of turn-based and realtime strategy.  First things first, however.  Ordered to defend your country by a grizzled old swine in a general's costume, you've got to select a European country theme squad of pigs to chill with.  Stereotypes were resorted to for team designation, though they're overdone to a point that's just plain silly as opposed to downright offensive.  Groups include the Sushi Swine (China), Piggystroika (Russia), Uncle Ham's Hogs (USA), etc.  Since the national jabs are taken to an extreme, it's hard not to wheeze out a chuckle when you see soldier names like Herr Dry, Herr Gel, or Schnitzel filling out the Sow-A-Krauts' (Germany) ranks.  War is hell, especially when it's up close and personal.  Turn by turn, you command one single pig after another, exploiting a brief period of time that's alloted in which to move about freely or take one offensive action. During this fleeting respite from death n' destruction, grunts can search for powerup crates, health provisions and opposing forces using their peepers or a mini-map to guide them.  Enemy forces respond in a like manner when time's up or you've finished sending a token of undying hatred into their midst.  The kicker is that everything's taking place on a wide-open, three dimensional battlefield.  Although the environment's not really interactive, minefields, randomly placed crates, baneful pools of water and elevated terrain zones change the combat dynamics between confrontations.  Play couldn't be simpler, as you're merely trying to maneuver through the brush and frag enemy soldiers.  But, per usual, the execution of such a low-level concept isn't quite so cut and dried.  In this case, firearms are employed as the great equalizer.  Pistols, sniper rifles, shotguns and other sidearms function on line of sight principles.  Hold down L1 and you can operate the gun sight, though the longer you take to aim, the jerkier the crosshair gets.  Grenades, bazookas, mortars, cluster bombs and other explosives utilize a power bar, which determines the distance an object's thrown based on how long you keep the X button pressed. Trial and error is a complementary, yet necessary evil.  Weapons deplete the oinkers' health points, and when the buggers' heart counters reach nil, they go boom, damaging everyone standing in the near vicinity.  As missions progress, you'll seize control of parts of the Saustralasian continent. Peaceful lulls accompany the end of a battle, providing ample time for commanding officers to spend points garnered from victories to promote the squad.  Under this system, your hams can grow in power and skill by electing to follow one of four career paths (heavy weapons, engineer, espionage, medic).  Advantages of the various job choices include the ability to heal wounds, utilize explosives, and bring mega-huge guns to bear, among other delectable bonuses.  Signs of promise can be misleading, though.  While the game's fun for the first few levels, it becomes wearisome early on into the campaign. Regardless of how many ways Infogrames jumbles up the scenarios, they all boil down to the same damn thing: Get out of an initial pickle, find the bad guys, and blow them to kingdom come.  A robust multiplayer deathmatch mode extends the replay value, but you won't be able to fight fatigue for long.  Graphics Visually, Hogs of War's environments are strikingly primitive.  Dated textures flesh out the natural landscapes and character models.  Luckily, small touches like muck that sprays up from underfoot and clouds of breath that hang in the air divert attention from the eerily smiling piggies. Smoke, fire, and explosive effects don't detract from the gameplay.  Blocky bullets, followed by a pudgy light trail, unfortunately do.  I wish that everything looked so fine as the animated menus, particularly the characters, who walk, run, jump, stumble, and collapse like androids suffering from circuit overload.   Sound Thank the gods of videogaming!  The speech clips are definitely better than the sight gags.  Actors do hatchet jobs on foreign accents, producing oh so clever phrases like ~Take this one, blighter!~ or ~Velcome to my vorld of pain.~  Rousing war era tunes fill out the soundtrack, with brief, country-specific blurbs thrown in randomly during play.  Explosive booms and the unmistakable whiz of shots fired grace the escapade with their presence, though they're hardly the cat's meow (or pig's swill, if you will).I've played a lot of heinous, boring, disgustingly derivative products inmy time. Hogs of War isn't one of them, however.  As the next evolution ofthe Worms concept, it holds up extremely well under pressure, mostly due toits goofy sense of humor and endearing antics.  Nevertheless, more effortcould have been taken to exploit the depths of the strategic model. Andwhat the hey, better graphics wouldn't have hurt either. Prospective buyers needn't worry about the purchase, but don't count on sticking by this gal till death do you part. She's a shallow porker.", "date": "Sep 30, 2000"}
