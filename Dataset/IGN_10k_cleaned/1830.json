{"name": "The Messenger", "name_review": "The Messenger", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/03/09/the-messenger", "text": "DreamCatcher's latest offering, The Messenger, is as hardcore as adventure gaming gets. There's little in the way of filler, and the exposition is kept in bite-sized pieces. It's all about full-on clicking. More combining of objects, more keys, more objects to find in locations -- it's the 1000 puzzle piece set for those used to the 250 puzzle sets, and except for that little part where hardcore adventure gamer is an oxymoron, this would be a godsend for those who felt that games like Escape From Monkey Island were just too straightforward. But that's the problem -- the people that play adventure games nowadays are in it for the dialogue, storyline and adventure, not for a nonstop cavalcade of ~what goes where~ puzzles, especially when taken to the levels of The Messenger.  The story shuffles you into action as quickly as possible. You play Morgana Sinclair, whose father has passed away, and who starts the saga by listening to a tape he left her after his death. He recalls an excavation at the Louvre where Ivory tablets written by a 14th century wizard were found, along with a statue. After deciphering the statue, he discovered that the innocuous (and ugly) Lion perfume burner is actually one of four elements of Satan's keys. When joined, in will come Armageddon. Never mind the logic -- the point is that you must break out your skintight leather jumpsuit and break into the Louvre and destroy all four pieces in order to prevent the disaster from ever happening.  You sneak into the Louvre and find the Lion statue, only to be confronted by a ghostly Templar who has waited 600 years to show a potential savoir how to destroy the keys. It seems the whole affair is a matter of revenge -- tortured Templars learned the black arts and cast the dark spell on the objects to get back on their tormentor Philippe IV. The good thing about all this madness is that at least dead Templars can open the gates of time, giving you a perfect excuse to explore the Louvre in four different time periods as you attempt to find and destroy the four objects before the world comes to an end far in the future.  Once you're thrust into the past, it's time to start gaming. You can look in all directions with your mouse, but only a few locations are active to explore in every room. As you peek around a room, the mouse will change, letting you know if you can use an item with an object or just pick up an object, whether you can move in a certain direction, or examine something closer. You can pop in for a closer look at special objects, or examine, combine, separate or use items from your inventory. It's all pretty straightforward, and at first you'll be happy with the simplicity with which the developers have designed the Messenger. Of course, you haven't encountered any puzzles.  There a few modern changes to the adventure formula that some gamers have grown accustomed to, and most have relied on, most important of which is that you keep puzzles and puzzle objects in the same general area. In other words, you don't have someone get stuck twenty rooms away because they didn't find a piece of rock hidden in the first room. The Messenger throws that right out the window. Each time period may take place at the Louvre, but you'll have a lot of areas to explore in every time, and each one has its share of secrets, mouseover objects, and puzzles to solve. While you won't necessarily have to worry about finding objects over different time periods, there will be a ton of stopping points in the game where you'll have no idea how to progress simple because you haven't found a key or object on the other end of the Louvre. Because things are so spread out, and because you're constantly being hit with new objects to use, it becomes an elaborate game of ~click and see,~ where you'll have to keep trying everything in your inventory on every little object, just to see what works. In the game's defense, the map feature does allow you to hop back to areas you've already explored saving you some footwork, however.  Mouseovers? Get ready for a cavalcade. The amount of teeny objects to search for in every room can get atrocious, particularly when you've got a 360 view of your environment. I can't tell you how much I yelled when I was stuck for an hour on a puzzle, just to realize that I had missed a key lying on the floor almost underneath a bed in a completely different area, a place I would have never thought to look... because I thought I had swiveled around in every possible location in every room. So while the pacing is quick because of the constant puzzles, it also means that you'll constantly be stuck in problems with no conversations or story points to keep you entertained. In fact, there are so many objects to keep track of that you've got to use magical chests located all over the map that allow you to switch around what you've got in your inventory, since the designers also limit what you can hold on your person. It's nice to see that they took my least favorite part of Resident Evil and decided it was a perfect option to use in an adventure game.  Even if you're into object puzzles galore and a lot of mouse searching, what you're left with is a story-light adventure game, and without a great story you're only left with the frustration. Since the gameplay is frustrating and generally tedious, you're not left with much. At least the graphics aren't bad. The character designs are pretty simple, but you've got animations for nearly every action performed in the game, which provide for some eye candy while you're exploring. The 360 degree view style is also great, and gives you a more involving experience than the standard still screen exploration offered in many modern first person adventure games.  Sound wise, you won't be impressed or annoyed by the music. It sets the mood without leaving a lasting impression, but at least that's much more favorable than the brittle feeling most lower-budget adventure games leave on your ears. In its favor, the voice acting is actually classier than you'd expect, with Morgana playing as this year's Lara Croft, prim British accent and all.  The Messenger doesn't really deliver any message at all, just a sort of monochromatic gaming experience that will have you wondering when the story will kick in. Sure it's nonstop puzzles and as fast action as an adventure game can actually get, but there's little to drive you to completion. Stick with some of the better adventure games out there from last year (Longest Journey being the top), and you'll be a happier clicker overall.  -- Vincent Lopez Want to share your opinions with the world?
