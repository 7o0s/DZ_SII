Sure, I may be able to run UT III in a higher resolution and with more graphical frippery on my PC, but the fact that I can now plug a mouse and keyboard into my PS3, hop straight into an online game and soak it all up on an eye-bleedingly huge screen means that the times they are a changing.    In other words, UT III holds up admirably on console. And as fans of the series would expect, it's an embarrassment of choice. This game is packed to the gills with modes, maps, mutators and options. It's also very newbie friendly, as its robust multiplayer functionality is paired nicely with an excellent offline component. New to the game and don't want to undergo a trial by fire online? Play through some of the single player campaign, or learn a map and mode against bots.   It's a good thing too because UT has always been a very fast-paced, furious experience and UT III is no exception. Your character moves at speed, and shoot-outs are often resolved in a split second - one player explodes in a shower of gibs, one player doesn't. That said, the series continues to adapt and evolve, shifting up the pace and style of the gameplay with a number of new modes and new inclusions. Vehicle Capture the Flag (or in UT III's case 'FLaG'  it's some kind of awkward acronym) and Warfare (a re-imagining of Onslaught), for instance, both offer very different experiences from the archetypal UT gameplay, and once you throw in hoverboards and bizarre Necris vehicles you've definitely got a game brimming with new possibilities.   Oh goodie, it's another impossibly buff space marine type. Huzzah!  Taking a step back, the basic game modes are present and correct  Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Duel and CTF. Hosting or joining a game is simplicity itself, and maps range from tight and enclosed to more open or tiered. Expect to shoot it out on urban city streets, in dark, Giger-inspired caverns and space ships, through maze-like industrial complexes and amongst temples and shrines. There's a huge amount of variety on offer here, and the maps are simply gorgeous: richly detailed thanks to great art design and sophisticated modelling.   The weapon loadout will be familiar to anyone who has played the series, representing a good mix of UT past and present. The Impact Hammer and Enforcer are back in the roster for instance, while old favourites like the Flak Cannon return once more (if it ain't broke) to wreak devastation with crazy ricochet buckshot action. And, of course, each weapon has an  often very useful - alt-fire.   One mechanic that returns from previous games and really comes to the fore in CTF is the ability to hit square and switch to your Translocator. This nifty device lets you fire out a teleportation node with R1 then to instantly teleport to it with L1. Not only does this come in handy for instantly getting up to out-of-reach platforms, but it can also be used defensively. You can fire out the node, for instance, then switch to a weapon and continue fighting. Get into a situation you can't win and you can switch back to the Translocator and teleport out of there. Or better still, leave the node back near your flag and if the opposing team picks it up you can port back to try and take the carrier down.    Two things - player customisation can come up with some cool stuff (right), and secondly, the Scavengers are creepy as all hell (left).  There are a few other mechanics you should know about too, such as double jumping, evasive dashes (move the left analogue stick to one side and hit jump), playing dead (hit down on the D-pad) and issuing commands or taunting opponents (bring up the menu by hitting left on the D-pad), to name a few. It may be fast and twitch-based, but UT III has plenty to offer skilled, experienced players to give them an edge in combat.   And then there are the Mutators, which have the power to fundamentally change the gameplay. Simply switch across to the Mutators screen when setting up a game and you can choose from an array of options  any of which can be activated at once. Some are designed to balance the gameplay out: Big Head, for instance, increases players' head sizes depending on how high their kills to deaths ratio is; while Handicap gives struggling players health and armour boosts. Others fundamentally change the feel of the game. You can set one hit kills, speed up or slow down player movement, speed up firing rate, lower gravity and even (in single player only) introduce a cool slow-mo every time you get a kill. These  in combination with the huge map count, great weapon loudout and expanded roster of modes  really help push UT III's longevity into the stratosphere. It's nothing new for the series, but it's still damn cool.    So we've run through the standard modes, what about Vehicle CTF and Warfare? The former is exactly what you'd expect really  take CTF, open up the environments considerably, then throw in a range of vehicles, many of which return from UT 2004, including the Scorpion, a jeep with short-range offensive capabilities and the ability to snap out razor sharp blades that can literally cut enemies in two, and the Raptor, an awesome air-to-ground craft that's both powerful and handy for quickly moving across a map. Especially cool, however, are the new Necris vehicles  the towering Darkwalker, for instance, can traverse the most uninviting terrain with its long legs, while the Viper is a fast-moving hoverbike that can be used for kamikaze runs at enemy nodes (more on that in a sec). They're creepy and biomechanical in look, and a great addition to the game considering the Necris presence in so many of the map designs. Importantly, they also offer significantly different abilities to the Axon vehicles - palette-swapping this is not.   Last but not least is Warfare. This is another team-based mode with vehicles, but the gameplay revolves around nodes that must be captured and held in order to destroy the opposing team's Power Core. In a simple example, you may start out with each team controlling a Power Core at opposite ends of the map, with one node in the middle. In order to win the game, your team must take the central node, which then opens up the opposing team's Power Core to attack. If the central node falls you must recapture it before you can resume your attack on the Core.    Hey guys, I've got an awesomie idea, how about we attack the enemy core?  There are a number of other layers to the gameplay, however. While a node can be taken by wearing down its defences (i.e. shooting at it) and then building up your own defences (using the alt-fire for the Link Gun), the game also has orbs, which can be carried across the map from a spawn point to instantly change a node's allegiance and strengthen its defences. Ensuring an orb's path to a node, then, is hugely important.   Further shifting things up, some of the larger maps have a heap of interconnected nodes, and while many are directly needed to take the map, others can be secured to gain extra vehicles or offensive capabilities (tank factory node!) or to do damage to the enemy Power Core without lowering its shields.    The idea is obviously to have flashpoints change as the balance of power shifts, and to have real tug of war battles, and in this Warfare succeeds. That said, for Warfare to be at its best it's really important to have a full complement of players and for everyone to be working as a team. Tick those boxes and it's good stuff and a real change from vanilla UT.   We should also mention that in place of the Translocator in both Vehicle Capture the Flag and Warfare is the Hoverboard. Sounds gimmicky on the surface, but it's a legitimately useful option in the game, both for quickly covering some ground or for carrying the flag, as you can't carry the flag in a vehicle. You can even hitch a ride (or 'skitch' for those down with the kids) behind a friendly vehicle. While the animations are pretty goofy, it's balanced well in terms of gameplay  you don't have any offensive capabilities on the Hoverboard and if you take a hit you're thrown off it and will drop whatever you're carrying, whether it's a flag or an orb.   Riding into battle on his trusty steed, Durotan of the Frostwolf Clan knew he may never again see another dawn. Oh... Really? We have respawners now? Sweet!  So yes. If you want a quick explosive romp, you've got many a mode to choose from, while if you're up for something with a little more in the way of teamwork and tactics - again, UT III has got you covered. Everyone's happy. Same deal with controls. If you've been weened on console shooters, you'll be pleased to hear the Sixaxis does a great job, with smooth movement and just enough aim assist to help get you in the zone without compromising on skill, while plug and play mouse and keyboard support is a godsend. Mouse control isn't quite as smooth as on PC, with a slight jerky feeling, but it's still very good, and there are a number of parameters that can be tweaked (turn acceleration, mouse speed) to suit your play style. In short, we like. We should mention, however, that it's pretty annoying that button displays aren't remapped in-game when you plug those devices in. It's obvious enough to use WASD for movement, for instance, but what the hell button on a keyboard is square? Oh well, you'll work it out.   There's no question UT III is a very good game but it would be remiss of us not to mention a couple of little quibbles we have. For one, bot AI  while an excellent challenge in the more straightforward game modes  falls apart at times when playing the more complex game modes. Not a big deal  just take that sucker online! Perhaps more significantly, it remains to be seen how many of the maps in the game will become true classics. While there's a huge selection, very few stood out as iconic in actual layout  the bigger maps were a little bland, while the smaller maps were incredibly pretty, but without much personality beyond looks. Don't get me wrong, UT's gameplay is more than strong enough to carry maps that aren't wildly interesting - especially in team-based games, I'm just saying that there's no Tokara Forest or Longest Yard for me here yet. Then again, maybe I just need to sink more time in and gain a deeper understanding of each map's rhythm. Guess I'd better get  back to it then.While UT III doesnt reinvent the wheel, its a fantastically entertaining game nonetheless, and well worth a look for veterans and newbies alike. Its larger than life sci-fi world and speedy, explosive gameplay really work on console and the whole thing runs like a dream. A great PS3 port, and a ready demonstration of what the system can do in the right hands.", "date": "Feb 20, 2008"}
