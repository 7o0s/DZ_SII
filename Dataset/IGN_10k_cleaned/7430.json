The gang at Petroglyph managed to translate the popular Star Wars franchise into a real-time strategy format, recapturing the magic and appeal of all those backyard action figure wars we fought as kids. Though we loved the overall presentation of the game -- specifically the fact that it really felt like Star Wars -- we were less than enthused by the predictability of the combats, both in terms of the limited unit rosters and the tiny, straightforward maps.   Today the team has released a brand new expansion pack, Forces of Corruption, that not only builds on their previous successes but also remedies many of the problems we had with the original game. While it's no surprise that the game's fans are hungry for more content, the expansion pack is good enough to attract gamers who passed on the original based on our earlier criticism.   In brief, Forces of Corruption picks up where Empire at War left off, just after the events in A New Hope. As the Empire and Rebellion regroup, a new crime lord steps onto the galactic stage. Tyber Zann, a former partner of Jabba the Hutt, decides it's the right time for him and his Consortium to take advantage of the turmoil. After first settling his rivalry with Jabba the Hutt and his minions, he sets out to steal some of the Emperor's most prized possessions.  Since the designers were free from the need to stick so closely to the events of the films, they were able to come up with a very original story that lacks the familiarity of the Galactic Civil War but still feels like a natural part of that universe. Without relying on the movies to provide context for it all, the writers have put more effort into creating a plotline and cast of characters that makes sense all on its own.   Even though the core story is entirely new, the expansion makes great use of the characters and settings from the films and the extended universe. A wide array of villains find their way into the game, from Admiral Thrawn and Prince Xizor to the bounty hunters and night sisters. Although the Rebels are present in the campaign, they're sort of marginalized. Players hoping to discover the new Rebel offerings are going to have to seek them out in the Galactic Conquest mode.    We're still a little disappointed that the campaign doesn't tie in more closely with the action of the films. The few references to events from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi are tossed off very casually and leave you feeling like you missed out on something cool and important. The missions that have you scavenging the wreckage of the original Death Star or stealing gas from Bespin are great examples of how the campaign can tie into events we're familiar with without simply rehashing the encounters from the film. We wish there had been a bit more of that.  In addition to the new campaign, the game offers players the chance to take on the open-ended Galactic Campaign or a variety of skirmish battles. The only real difference now is that players can fight in three-way conflicts and even pit the same factions against each other in offline skirmishes and online multiplayer battles.  Gamers who delved into the original game were rewarded with two unique factions. The Rebels and Imperials had very different abilities and so had to accomplish their objectives in very different ways. Zann's faction brings their own distinctive strategies to the battle, so players will have to adapt their own strategies accordingly.      At the core of the Consortium's strategy is the concept of corruption. Being a criminal organization, they're less concerned with who owns a planet than they are with getting their cut of the action. The Consortium's Defiler units can be sent to nearby planets to spread a variety of different types of corruption. Though each type of corruption brings unique benefits, it's the overall concept of corruption that's important.  Corrupted worlds are the foundation for Zann's power to strike at his enemies. His fleets can bribe their way past corrupted worlds, bypassing enemy fleets entirely. He can visit corrupted worlds to buy Rebel or Imperial technology on the black market. He can send saboteurs to corrupted worlds to demolish important buildings. He can even view the ground forces and buildings on a corrupted world and see exactly where they're positioned so he can plan his own ground assaults more efficiently. In all, corruption is an incredibly interesting element that makes the Consortium a lot of fun to play with and against.   Land battles are much improved. The maps are significantly larger this time around and offer more options for maneuvering. There are still chokepoints galore, but you'll often be able to find your way around plenty of obstacles to strike at your enemy from multiple directions. This isn't quite as true during the campaign, but it definitely makes skirmish battles much more fluid.  Loads of extra features help add a little more excitement and strategy to land battles. For one thing, the environments themselves can be openly hostile towards your units. Whether you're skirting rivers of lava or battling indigenous peoples, there's a lot more going on with these maps than simply finding your enemy. There are even certain terrain types that can only be traversed by infantry, which requires even more sophisticated planning on your part  A greater number of valuable build pads are scattered around now, giving each map numerous points of focused conflict. . Additionally, the inclusion of bunkers and mobile pads give you a chance to set up concentrated defensive positions, freeing you to concentrate on your own maneuvers.    Space battles haven't really changed much but there are many more unit types now, so you may not always know what to expect when you encounter an enemy fleet. B-wings, buzz droids and TIE Defenders each bring new surprises and challenges that just weren't present in the original game. Throw in cool Consortium abilities like cloaking, shield leeching and asteroid navigation and space battles become much more interesting. We particularly like the fact that the Death Star can now fire on capital ships during the space battles. In fact, there are a number of new superweapons that really help to capture the level of power seen in the films.  The original game frustrated our attempts to find a happy medium between an acceptable framerate and attractive visuals. Some of that has definitely been addressed in the expansion. While it's still a bit of a juggling act to find the right mix of options, the expansion seems to run a bit better overall. There are still moments where the framerate dips into single digits now and then, but this usually only occurs in the massive space battles where you have lots of units and lots of effects on the screen at once. The final mission of the campaign will really test your system's performance on that score.      Art design is solid overall. The familiar faces that have made their way into the expansion look believable and the completely original assets fit nicely with the Star Wars style. The models can't quite stand up to the close-ups used in the cutscenes but they're more than adequate for the views you'll be using to play the game.  Varied height layers are the most impressive of the game's new visual elements. Though they're only used on a handful of maps, the sense of scale you get from looking down at a second layer of terrain adds so much to the believability and excitement of the battles. Fighting on the platforms above the clouds on Bespin, or the wavy sea of Kamino just makes the game feel more like Star Wars.   The same can be said of the original music. Taking a cue (haha!) from John Williams' use of characteristic themes and instrumentation for characters and concepts, the new score for the game colors and reinforces the drama of each moment. The standard Star Wars sound effects are put to good use here as well, and the voice acting is good enough to support the story.While there was a lot to love about the original Empire at War, there were some design decisions that left many gamers, including us, feeling a little dissatisfied. Petroglyph seems to have taken all of those criticisms to heart and improved on nearly every single aspect of the game. What's more, they've managed to make all the necessary improvements to the original design while still creating loads of entirely new content. Those who disliked the repetitiveness of the original game will definitely appreciate the new faction, the new campaign and the units and abilities.", "date": "Oct 24, 2006"}
