Reflection's racer has now been re-released for the PSP through the PlayStation Store, and with it a new generation of gamers are able to crash the hell out of their rides in hopes of glory.   Destruction Derby has a handful of play modes, including Stock Car Racing, which is only about coming in first place, Destruction Derby, which is solely about killing everyone else's cars, and Wreckin' Racing, which is a combination of the two. There's also a Time Trial available for single-player purposes, though as is the case with every other PSone release on the PSP, you're unable to partake in any of the game's numerous multiplayer options.    For each of these modes (aside from Time Trial), you're able to compete in a practice event, a one-on-one duel, or enter a championship season. The championship option is obviously the deepest mode here, spanning your racing achievements over a number of races. Unfortunately, you're unable to mix-and-match event types here, so you can't go from a Destruction Derby to a Wreckin' Race in the same championship series, for example.   Though you are allowed a number of options for the challenge type, the most disappointing aspect of the game has to do with the number of tracks available, or lack thereof, actually. With only one Destruction Derby arena (though to be honest, you don't need much more than a large circle) and only about a half-dozen race courses, there isn't a whole lot of variety. It doesn't help that the courses themselves are rather uninteresting as well, based mostly around 90-degree turns on a flat course.   While there isn't a whole lot of interesting variety to be found in the tracks, what makes Destruction Derby fun is the pure chaos that you'll partake in during every event. The game is based around the vulnerability of the cars, and smacking into them while entering a corner and watching them spin behind you is great fun. The Destruction Derbies are also good fun, as flooring it into the middle of a giant pile and watching the parts fly is pretty rewarding.    The driving controls are set up rather loosely, so properly controlling your car can take a bit of getting used to. While they'll tend to over steer in turns, they do respond quickly and accurately to your input, so it is possible to really refine your driving abilities. While overall the controls are a little lacking, as the game is so chaotic to begin with, the lack of dead-perfect controls don't hamper the experience too much.   From a visual standpoint, Destruction Derby still stands as a technically-impressive PlayStation game. The cars take on and show a great deal of damage, and bits and pieces fly every time you crash. There's a tad bit of slow-down here and there, but it's not too often and doesn't get in the way of the game's playability.Destruction Derby is a pretty fun racer, focusing on chaos rather than racing refinement. There's a good deal of enjoyment to be had in the madhouse racing, though the lack of track options and even decent track design does hurt its overall appeal.", "date": "Feb 16, 2007"}
