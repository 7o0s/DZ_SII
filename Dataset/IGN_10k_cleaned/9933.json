Solid Snake's first mission, originally in North America on the NES in 1988, is the springboard for his adventures in international terrorism and intrigue. While later chapters in the series spun intricate (and occasionally bizarre) storylines, Metal Gear tells a relatively straightforward tale of Snake's insertion into the Outer Heaven stronghold to rescue a captured comrade (Gray Fox) and destroy a super computer. The super computer was a big change from the Japanese version of Metal Gear, where the target was actually a mech.   The mobile version of the game is based not on the NES version, but the original Japanese MSX2 personal computer version. It also includes a few extra modes, such as a new easy difficulty level which will likely be useful to more casual players.    Metal Gear was one of the first console games to really use stealth as a game mechanic. As Snake slips around the Outer Heaven complex, he must keep out of the vision cone of terrorists, guards, and security cameras. Depending on the reaction of terrorists spotting Snake, they may chase him into the next room or just let him go about his business. Guards also rally if just one of them spots Snakes, too, so sneaking through crowded areas is paramount. Snake can indeed fight back, but at first, he's limited only to punches. He must locate weapons, such as a pistol and machine gun, in order to fight off enemies that are just too aggressive or aware.    The idea of moving around connected rooms wasn't an exactly new prospect in Metal Gear -- Haunted House and the Swordquest games for the Atari 2600 offered this -- but the architecture in Metal Gear was innovative at the time. The way everything was related and how rooms often had sub-rooms (sneaking into the back of a troop transport to collect items, for example) gave Metal Gear some extra oomph.   Metal Gear is also the birthplace of the radio scanner, a feature that's incredibly important to storytelling in future Metal Gear titles. Via different frequencies, Snake can communicate with his handler, Big Boss, and other characters. It's a cool feature and it comes across fine on the smallest screen because Konami does a good job making sure the text is always readable.   I was not exactly into Metal Gear back in 1988 because, admittedly, I was more into brighter adventures. Metal Gear was appropriately brown-gray gritty for its subject matter, but I was definitely more of a Mario/Alex Kidd/Wonder Boy gamer. I did rediscover it later on and found it to be an engaging game, especially the way it set up boss battles with real drama. (I'm not spoiling the story here -- sorry.) The game works exceptionally well on mobile. Old-school fans will definitely want to snare it for their handsets.  Metal Gear for mobile is an exceptional port of the classic game and I cannot imagine why any fan of Solid Snake wouldn't want this on their phone. The Tetris and Bejeweled crowd should pass, though, as this is a pretty tough little game that leans hardcore.", "date": "Jan 31, 2008"}
