Another Age is to AC2 as Project Phantasma and Master of Arena were to the original AC -- a standalone expansion of the original game. You don't have to have the original to play it, but it is in essence the same game, just with new core parts and a massive selection of new missions. Otherwise, all the same comments as far as graphics, gameplay, and everything else apply.   What can be said, then, is that this is easily the best Armored Core expansion yet. The PlayStation expansion discs differed from the original in that they featured fewer missions by at least half. Another Age, in contrast, has an even 100 missions, which dwarfs the selection in AC2 (30 and change, plus all the arena opponents). If you like Armored Core, and it's admittedly an acquired taste, this is a hell of a lot of Armored Core, and the lack of modem online play in the American version is no great loss. At the same time, this won't change anyone's mind about From's rather quirky ideas about what makes good mech control.   Gameplay  Like AC2, Another Age has a branching mission tree that follows your mercenary career through a series of employers and tasks. The difference, of course, is that there's much, much more to do, with a wider array of hiring corporations and different missions in the chaos after Leos Klein's failed rebellion. From Software's level designers have put together some very interesting concepts, too, with much more verticality in the missions, rather than broad but flat areas.   Also like AC2, though, there is still no true dual analog control. You still have to aim on the Y-axis with the shoulder buttons (those control the altitude of your aiming point), which means flying enemies are a ridiculous pain in the neck, and the vertical quality that makes some missions so interesting also makes some shootouts extremely frustrating -- dodging shots while trying to aim up at the next floor is hard enough without having to skirt the edge of a pit full of lava, but the game expects you to do this with digital controls.   But if you can live with the controls, and the game certainly has a following that can, Another Age has enough simulation options to drive you bats, including plenty of new core parts with which to build and modify your personal mech (extensions now have many more uses, and it's possible to get an extra speed boost with the ~OVER BOOST~ feature). This is, all things considered, the most Armored Core for the money that you've ever been able to buy.   Graphics  And it still doesn't look half bad, even after almost a year of newer and sharper PlayStation 2 game. Another Age still has a rather spartan look much of the time, with very basic, sparse backgrounds, but the texturing and lighting on the mechs are still quite good in comparison to current games, and the rock-solid framerate could teach a few developers a lesson. Very little has changed graphically, save for a few better-looking outdoor and aerial missions (battling on top of giant air transports is fun), but that would be more of a knock against a weaker visual production.   Sound  Here's where Agetec gets a big thumbs-up for another well-done Armored Core localization job. There's an awful lot of recorded voice in the many mission briefings, and while the lack of any lips to synch it to obviously makes the job a lot easier, the delivery is still smooth and effective. Some of the wackier Mr. Johnsons are actually rather fun to listen to, in fact. The rest of the soundtrack doesn't stand out so well, being comprised mainly of standard AC-brand beats and exploding effects, but it's a competent job.For a more comprehensive discussion of the Armored Core experience, it would certainly be worthwhile to check out the original Armored Core 2 review.  Essentially all comments made there about how the game looks, sounds, plays, and feels apply just as well to Another Age, and the whole thing is many times more entertaining to read than this brief affair.But when you're actually at the shop picking stuff out, there's no reason to play the original over this successor if you can only buy one.  The PS Armored Core expansions offered less than their predecessors, while this one offers a good deal more.  Armored Core fans have of course probably already bought it, so that leaves only a small minority left, but wherever they are, this is the place to jump on board.", "date": "Aug 27, 2001"}
