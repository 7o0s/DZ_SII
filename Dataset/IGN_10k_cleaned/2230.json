Most folks feel that the best boxing game they played was Mike Tyson's Punch-Out way back in the day on NES. But whether it's arcade or simulation boxing you're after, on PS2 the pickin' is slim.   To be honest, most systems' choices are few and far between. On PlayStation 2, Midway's Ready To Rumble Boxing definitely aims from the arcade side of things, with oodles of humor, style, and loads of party-style fun. But it's as shallow as a kiddy pool. On the simulation side of things there's EA's Knockout Kings, which delivers mountains of modes and options, an incredible array of boxers from the past and the present, but it's slow and clumsy, and unable to deliver the quickness and nimbleness of light, fast boxers such as Sugar Ray Leonard.   Straight out of Japan is developer New Corporation's Victorious Boxers, a simplistic looking boxing game that's Japanese in look and style, but that offers an intuitive control style, a slew of boxers, from the lightning quick to the slow but powerful, and a subtle learning curve and depth that feels just right. The game is based on a phenomenally popular manga by a similar name in Japan, and while that means absolutely nil here in North America, perhaps it should. Victorious Boxers is a splendid mix of arcade and sim-style boxing that's come the closest yet to getting boxing ~right.~   Gameplay Victorious Boxers is kind of like one of those Japanese baseball games from Konami (Powerful Pro Baseball); Victorious Boxers presents cute, little players that almost look super deformed (but aren't), who have hairless chests (and for that matter, bodies), have clean-cut faces with extra big wide eyes, and who have hair that's...how else can I describe it...very Japanese in style. And strangely enough, despite the stereotypical Japanese looks, it's not so ludicrously cute that it loses its appeal here in the West. No, Victorious Boxers may look cute and clean at first, but once you get over the almost banal visuals, it's a surprisingly deep, and compelling, boxing game.   While picking up the moves are quite easy at first, it takes a while to get used to Victorious Boxers' defensive scheme. The moves themselves are simple enough, and it's nice how the control scheme is laid out. Players start off with basic moves: straights, jabs and hooks, and a Special Move initiated by pressing the R1 button to engage it. But it's not the offense that takes time to learn, it's the defense.   Built right into the left analog is the ability to duck, weave, dodge, and dive to avoid the opponent's oncoming punch. With a simple push left, your boxer weaves left, push back and he leans back, and so on and so on, while his feet stay in place. It seems so easy that one might pick it up instantly, and while some folks might just do that, it wasn't that quick to master for me.   It's always hard in any boxing game to know when to duck or weave, because it takes a while to learn the opponent's moves, speed, and style. But in boxing videogames, the default tactic is always to throw as many punches as possible, hoping to land the super punch. I know that's not a good style in real boxing, or even in most simulation or arcade boxing games, but let's face it, when it comes to boxing games, defense is boring. Knocking out the opponent is the main event, and it's what you work for. So anyway, one eventually does get the hang of it, and once it's learned, the game grows wonderfully fun. It must be said that the control scheme is so simple and astoundingly intuitive it's even a little bewildering. This game's looks are so deceptive, because it looks like a kids game, but it's for hardcore boxing fans.   While getting the control is easy to learn, but hard to master, the game itself offers a very stripped down presentation. The gameplay modes comprise a whopping two areas, Story and Versus. In terms of options, real boxers, presentation, etc., Victorious Boxers is so far from EA's Knockout Kings it's not even funny. Knockout Kings is loaded to the brink with options and real boxers, create-a-player, career, modes, etc., but Victorious Boxers? It's got two modes. Sounds lopsided, but it's not entirely as bad as I'm making it.   In this game the Versus mode is essentially an arcade mode. It's open for single or two players to go head to head, or players can vie against the computer. Each time a player beats a new fighter in Story mode, that opponent becomes available for use in Vs. Players can set the number of rounds and knockout options, such as 1-3 KO's per fight, or free, which means an infinite amount, and the arena location. And you get to fight straight rounds, without a coach or ~boss~ guiding your progress in-between rounds.   One more thing about the gameplay style. The boxers automatically are programmed to face their opponents, with a kind of invisible Z-targeting functionality, and for the most part, this interfacing style works. It enables players to circle around their opponents, creating a natural tension, and the flexibility to back off, or jab and weave. It allows for various fighting styles to work properly: If you select a fast fighter, he can zip around, if you pick a slower bomber, he'll ploddingly circle in for the inside hit. For the most part, it's cool.   But it does pose problems, too. Oftentimes, when you move to the right of left of an opponent, the interface falters. Players might try to move away (left or right), but they'll get stuck facing away from their opponent, who naturally will amply apply a flurry of jabs to your face. When this happens, you're basically stuck for a few seconds, and it's disturbing as hell. It could very well cost you the game, too. Another example is that you might take a few hits, and stagger, and then end up facing away from your opponent, inviting the same kind of unfair punishment. On the other hand, his same problem might happen to the other boxer, so it's equally unfair to the computer, too.   As far as depth goes, Victorious boxers offers a great learning curve in the fighting department, and the roster of boxers also is incredibly deep. It's massive, in fact, with 44 boxers in all. Naturally, the boxers are all fictional (again, based on the manga), but they range in visuals, fighting styles, and personalities, which come across in the fights themselves. You'll fight long-armed boxers who prefer the hook, quick and nimble fighters who dance and sway, inside fighters who look for the combinations and uppercuts, and pure sluggers.   As Ippo Macunouchi, the star of the game, you start off with basic moves, but began your career with a dangerous counter blow and an upper cut that are deadly to both the body and the head. Progressing through the game's Story mode, Ippo learns three more Specials that shape him into a skilled, well-rounded boxer. With such a wide range of fighters, players must approach each one with a different set of tactics and timed use of their Specials.   Graphics The design style in Victorious Boxers is definitely an acquired taste in minimalism. It's a clean-looking game that presents players with simplistic textures, backgrounds, and characters. It's by no means a PS2 title to brag to your friends about from a graphics standpoint. But that would really be missing the point.   While the characters are simply shaded and are crafted in a cartoon style, they move fast and generally fool the eye well enough into believing they're moving like real boxers. Ippo himself offers very few expressions, despite the numerous close-ups during cut-scenes and camera angles that focus on his emotion before, during, or after a fight. In that same line of thinking, the cut-scenes are repetitive and totally skippable. They're so repetitive that you're sure to memorize the few lines that exist: ~Um!~ ~That was a great knock-out! Keep it that way next time, too!~ ~You're like a punch bag (sic) out there,~ and ~Yes, boss!~   The one noticeable and likeable aspect that Victorious Boxers offers is the visual damage to the face. Players take on bruised eyes, reddened faces, and sagging faces, and they can get pretty haggard near the end of say a five or six round fight. In short, the game is stylistic but limited visually.   Sound Along with the streamlined presentation and minimal graphics is an even more restricted set of sounds. The game presents players with emotionally moving boxing music -- emblematic themes and marching style songs. But overall it's limited in variety. There are no actual voice-overs, either. The characters speak in voice-bubbles, just like in the comics (or in this case, just like manga). The sound, strangely, doesn't seem to hamper the gameplay or the overall feel of the game, though.When it comes right down to it, Victorious Boxers is a surprisingly deep and compelling boxing game, despite its overall minimalist approach to design, sound, and presentation. While staying up late last night to play the game, several times I found that I stood up and raised my arms up in the air an silently cheered after a lengthy, hard-fought battle (hey, my wife was asleep in the next room). The gameplay is uniquely engaging, and while I lost more than I won, I was pleased to have beat the learning curve, and to grow my man Ippo into a fully fledged contenda. I wouldn't say that Victorious Boxers is for everyone, but for the hardcore boxer out there who just can't get enough, this will definitely satisfy your boxing soul.", "date": "Nov 8, 2001"}
