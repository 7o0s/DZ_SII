He became a pinball in Kirby's Pinball Land, and in Kirby's Block Ball. He bounded about a motion-controlled environment in Kirby: Tilt 'n' Tumble. And, here, he hits the links  Kirby serves as an active, powered-up golf ball in Kirby's Dream Course.   It's miniature golf with a Kirby theme. Presented in a three-quarters, isometric perspective, an array of holes are rendered with checkerboard grids and populated with enemies first seen in Kirby's other games. The goal is ~strike~ Kirby like a golf ball and send him sailing into each of the scattered foes  making physical contact with each one will cause the final bad guy remaining on the course to transform into the stage-ending cup. Sink Kirby into it to clear the level.   There's really nothing else like it. The concept and design of Dream Course are truly unique  so much so that it can be a little confusing to get into right away. Luckily, a tutorial mode illustrates one by one the controls and techniques you'll need to come in under par. The basics are just like any standard golf game  choosing Kirby's direction, how much power to use when starting a shot, introducing back or top spin. But things get a lot more complex than simple Kirby's style might suggest, as you'll also have to judiciously use the A Button during Kirby's movement to give him extra speed boosts, properly navigate to and through on-course hazards, and learn the best way to take advantage of Kirby's many copy abilities.   Of these, there are ten  just like most every other Kirby game, the rotund hero can clone the powers of enemies he defeats and then use them to his advantage. In the golf context, many of them are recast to help Kirby maneuver more easily  the Stone power halts his forward momentum in an instant, the Hi-Jump power makes him leap up onto high ledges or across gaps, the Wheel makes him take off like a rocket at insane speeds. Other powers even give you limited, direct D-Pad control over Kirby for a short time, like the Parasol and UFO  used properly, they can guide him quickly and safely into the cup and may even score you a hole-in-one.   It's an odd but intriguing concept, and it's one that has good depth  there are eight different courses to unlock in all, each containing eight holes apiece, and there's additionally a two-player mode that can get pretty competitive. The negative to reiterate with this release is its learning curve, which can be intimidating to start. But, given time, it can also be a satisfying interface to master  figuring out the perfect angle, impact, and spin control to dominate each course is a lot of fun, and there are even multiple different ways that you could succeed on each same level.   Kirby's been getting knocked around for years, but that's just a hazard you've got to accept when you're a ball-shaped hero with stubby arms, no legs, and too-pink skin tone. Kirby's Dream Course is probably one of the least known of his games, but that doesn't diminish its fun  its presentation of Kirby's world and integration of the enemies and powers from his platforming adventures is a great match for a game like miniature golf, and what results is a quirky, goofy, but all-around satisfying game to play.
