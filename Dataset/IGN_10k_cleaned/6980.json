While it lacks the intrigue and drama of the Dan Brown version, Secrets of da Vinci: The Forgotten Manuscript offers a look at the historical realities of the famed Renaissance artist and inventor.  The game starts in 1522, just a few years after Leonardo's death. Players take on the role of Baldo, a former student of Leonardo's greatest pupil, Francesco Melzi. Baldo arrives at the master's former home, Clos Luce, in search of a missing manuscript. The reason Baldo is there is a bit mysterious. He's been dismissed by Melzi and hired by an unknown benefactor.   At the chateau, Baldo will have to contend with the current owner, Babou, and her suspicious gardner Saturnin. In addition to frequent references to Melzi, the game will highlight other historical persons, all the way from Charles V to Leonardo's lover Salaino. There will even be a few flashbacks featuring the master himself.  The game utilizes a simple click and move system. Most rooms have a handful of perspectives that you can move between depending on which items you want to study or manipulate. I would have liked to see animated transitions from one area to the next, like in 7th Guest or Myst 5, but here you just warp from one spot to the next. On the plus side, you can look around a full 360 degrees from every location, which really gives you a chance to take in all the wonderful details the artists have included.  As with most titles in the genre, Secrets of da Vinci requires that the player scour every inch of every view hunting for those small points of interactivity. Most are large enough to be fairly obvious but there are a few incredibly tiny ones that you'll really need to search for. There's also a bit of a thin line between taking an object and using it. I can't tell you how many times I tried to turn a crank only to ~accidentally~ place it in my inventory.   The inventory system is a total pain. There are five pages for items here and they're arranged only according to when you picked them up. As you use old items, new items fill the gaps left in your inventory. You can find yourself picking up four gold coins, for instance, and having them spread across three different pages of your inventory. Moving around different pages in the inventory isn't a big problem, but finding and identifying the items you need is harder than it should be.  I was happy to see that many of the puzzles are fairly intuitive and logical throughout the game. Solving by trial and error suffices in most cases. In other cases, you'll simply be told what to do by one of the characters in the game. Some of the puzzles represent real challenges faced by Leonardo -- like making ink, getting honey from a hive, or repairing a fountain. Still others are more abstract -- like sliding colored tiles around to recreate the Mona Lisa or sliding plates around to get colored balls to fall into the right colored cups.  Most of the puzzles are fairly easy, so they shouldn't prove too much of a challenge to adventure fans. Even novices should be able to figure things out fairly quickly. Honestly, you don't need a college degree to know that, when locked in your room, you simply slide a piece of paper under the door to catch the key when you push it out through your side of the lock. Still, the puzzles are satisfying enough to keep your interest.      Some of the tasks can be a bit tedious. Having to make paper or gold coins is plenty of fun, but having to do it multiple times in a row just gets boring. Pull out the tray, open the tray, drop in the paper mache, close the tray, push the tray back, lower the press, raise the press, pull out the tray, open the tray, remove the paper. Now repeat three more times. Once you've done it the first time, having to do it again and again just feels like pointless busy work.  In addition to the repetitive tasks, the game requires a fair amount of running back and forth. While it's fairly standard for the genre, you will get those occasional sequences where you're asked to run back and forth between two characters who could hardly be farther apart. After a while it, like the papermaking, just starts to seem more like a time sink than a part of the story.   Secrets of da Vinci boasts an allegedly important morality system but it really doesn't come into play that much. Players gain morality from tasks like feeding animals; we never managed to discover what might decrease it. In any case, players can also spend points earned completing puzzles to shift their morality to whatever side they want, making your moral choices in the game somewhat pointless. The only practical difference between playing good and playing evil is that certain actions will be off limits to you during a few encounters. Like if you've been good, you'll have to sneak past a guard rather than hitting him over the head with a pipe and stealing his clothes.  The game has been produced in partnership with the caretakers of the real chateau featured in the game. Now a museum dedicated to preserving Leonardo's memory, the chateau is brought to life within the game the way that it might have looked in the first years after Leonardo's death. The chateau itself and the grounds around it gives players a chance to explore the actual workshops and studios the artist used.   Each location is full of detail, from the Greek inscription above a bookcase in Leonardo's room to the massive presses and drills in his ground floor workshop. The whole effect is thoroughly convincing and really puts you in the moment. Though there are a few objects that animate during the game, many of your interactions with the world are a bit jumpy and disconnected. I'd much rather have seen full animations for things like mixing inks, chopping wood and so forth.  There aren't very many living people in the game but what character models are present are highly detailed and well animated. The lines on the gardner's face and the rich fabrics of Mme. Babou add layers of character and believability to their models.   The one really weak part of the game's visual presentation are the sequences that actually show your character. Rather than rendering it in the engine, your scenes are all presented as clumsy line drawings. In a game about one of the world's greatest artists, these simple line drawings seem horribly out of place and they instantly jolt you out of the reality that the rest of the visuals try so hard to achieve.Secrets of da Vinci doesn't offer the difficult challenges or compelling narrative of other successful adventure games but it does manage to give players a window into the historical Leonardo's past as well as giving them a greater appreciation of his artistic and engineering achievements. The attention to detail is very impressive here, both in terms of the visuals of the chateau and the facts about Leonardo's life and work. While it may not have the drama of albino assassins or museum murders, gamers who want to know more about the real Leonardo da Vinci will find this game to be a good starting point.", "date": "Jun 12, 2006"}
