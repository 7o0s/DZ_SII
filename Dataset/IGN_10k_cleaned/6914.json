More than any other console. Some are good, some are mediocre, and some are Classified: The Sentinel Crisis. It's not a broken game, by any means. There aren't any coding bugs that prevent you from progressing from level to level. The main problem is, it offers next to nothing in terms of incentive to continue playing through. Its gameplay is entirely generic, its graphics are far from stellar, and its AI patterns are less interesting than a glass of distilled water. In other words, it's a genuinely bad first person shooter.   Classified puts you in the boots of Collins, a Black Ops soldier in the military Sentinel Program. You won't really care about the story, but it involves tracking down a missing Sentinel Technology scientist in the Balkans. In the process you'll fight plenty of soldiers who all look the same, run through boring environments, and fire about eight gazillion bullets.    The star of Classified is your gun. Like how it looks? You'd better, because you're going to be staring at it the entire game. Instead of picking up different weapons in Classified, you pick up briefcases that give you additional weapon functions. Starting with an assault rifle, you'll gradually pick up grenade and rocket launcher functions, a bigger rifle magazine clip, shotgun, sniper, and jackhammer (auto-shotgun) additions. Using the black button to switch between functions, you'll only notice they've changed because of how the targeting reticule adjusts and slight alterations to your gun design. For instance, the sniper rifle causes a small scope to pop from the gun's top. The grenade launcher and rocket launcher, which look the same, are distinct because the assault rifle nozzle retracts. In addition to the exceedingly slight visual differences between the weapon variations, they take way too long to switch between. At least the explosive weaponry allows for Classified's most impressive feature: environmental destruction.   Some environmental objects actually explode in when hit by rockets or grenades, causing splash damage. It's definitely the best part of the Classified experience to drill an abandoned car with a rocket, see it explode, and watch the enemies fly around. Still, that doesn't redeem anything about the game. It's more like a patch of clear water amidst the oil spill that is Classified. In an interesting twist, grenades are incapable of blowing apart boxes. The rest of the arsenal produces lesser results, particularly the shotgun. Even when upgraded to the jackhammer, it's still useless unless you're two feet away from an enemy. The assault rifle will remain your weapon of choice throughout the game's entirety, since you're constantly picking up ammo for it and because it has 80 rounds when you expand its clip size. This means throughout Classified, you're going to be using the same weapon with the fire button constantly pressed. Not exactly a paragon of gameplay variety.    There are several sequences in the game that force you to switch up weapons, but any kind of engaging gameplay is ruined by poor enemy AI. If enemies are off in the distance, they'll stay put regardless of how many bullets you fire at them. This turns sniping into stationary target practice. If they're close, they'll either charge directly at you or stay put, making it really, really boring to fight them. Occasionally you'll see glimpses of intelligence, specifically when they run away from a grenade you shot, but that doesn't make it any more exciting. To help you out in locating targets, your Sentinel suit comes with a scanner that paints enemy positions with a circle on your screen. This feature is helpful, since it lets you locate snipers and distant targets more easily, especially since foes tend to blend into the blurry backgrounds. For its other powers, your suit has night vision which gets a few instances of use, but somehow makes the game's graphics look much worse. Your main health bar is accompanied by your suit's shield, which regenerates if you can stay away from enemy fire. Standard stuff.     Level design and objectives are extremely dull. Each stage starts you off with either a package to recover, site to bomb, or person to rescue. Objective positions are shown on your screen as an orange arrow to guide you through each stage. Levels are extremely linear, consisting of progressing from room to hallway to room, wiping out the enemies, then moving to the next. Enemies spawn as soon as you complete an objective, adding a jarring sense of unreality. For instance, if you plant a bomb or otherwise complete an objective, a room that was previously empty will suddenly be overflowing with enemies with no indication how they got there.   Battles with foes are no more appealing. Since enemies often run right up to you, combat is a simple matter of point, shoot at guy standing directly in front of you, continue shooting, wonder why he hasn't died yet, continue shooting, finally kill the guy, pan to your next target, and repeat. Enemies appear in larger and larger groups as the game goes on, so eventually you'll need to peek from around a doorway and take them out in a clockwise or counterclockwise fashion, depending on what side of the door you're on. The only real threats in firefights are enemy grenades, which foes will toss randomly. Other than that, the shooting sequences could barely be more simplistic. A few different enemy types pop up later on in the game, like shield carrying foes, rocket troops, and larger machine gun blasting adversaries, but taking them down hardly differs from the grunts.    There's an attempt to switch up the gameplay a little way into the game's only single player mode. Your Sentinel suit gets taken away, leading to a horrendous sneaking level where you'll need to get your suit back. The already sparse gameplay is even further broken down to a level where it's just you, one health bar, and a silenced pistol. In or out of the suit, you're bound to notice the game's control issues as well. Moving the left analog stick anywhere but straight ahead when moving forward slows movement by about 50%. Why? Is it impossible for a human to move quickly or impossible to do some quick cross-over steps to move to the side at high speeds? Because of this odd feature, getting around Classified's levels is even more of a chore. You can still turn at top speed by using the right stick, but you'll still get caught on the left stick speed aberration occasionally.   On to graphics. Explosions look decent, you can see pretty far into the distance, your own character model looks pretty good, and the sky occasionally catches your eye. It's nice to see a separate pan rate for the HUD on your helmet, making it seem like you're actually wearing one. The framerate stays steady as well. The rest of the visuals stink, plain and simple. Enemy models look practically identical. Their animations are stiff if they move around at all. Level designs are boring and landscapes are sparsely detailed. Textures are bad and in some cases terrible. The trees look like they belong in a PS One game. Turning on night vision is the equivalent of downing ipecac. The audio isn't much better. Music is bland, filled with electronic blips and forgettable ambient drums. Gun effects are weak and do nothing to make firing off 80 rounds exciting. As limited as the voice acting is, there are a few listenable lines in there, though some of it is laughable.Classified: The Sentinel Crisis isn't broken, but it's a bad game. It's got boring gameplay, poor graphics, unremarkable sound, and only one short game mode. Sure it's only 20 bucks, but it's not worth it. This may have been passable at the beginning of the Xbox's life cycle, but not now. While some of its individual elements may have occasional bright spots, Classified can't escape its gameplay pitfalls. It's just not a fun game.", "date": "May 24, 2006"}
