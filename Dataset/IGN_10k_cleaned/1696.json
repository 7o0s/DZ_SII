That is exactly what this import is. It's a strong title with most of the same features Motocross Madness has, but it trades glitz for more grit.   Motocross Mania looks initially like the famous competition. You race off-road motorcycles in racing and stunt competitions in indoor and outdoor arenas. There's a healthy amount of variety in the game, with rider skins, bike skins, bike classes, tracks, race types, stunts, and LAN and Internet(TCP/IP) support. Like Motocross Madness, there are practice settings, stunt competitions, motocross and supercross races, and baja racing.   The differences between the two games become apparent when looking more closely. Mania's graphics aren't as polished as the Madness visuals. Motorcycle tires aren't as round, the riders are less well defined, and some special effects like dust aren't as prevalent. The race modes are similar, but the Baja races aren't as spectacular as the Madness tracks, confined to smaller areas and lacking the animated background objects of Motocross Madness 2.   The physics model, however, is clearly different and seems more realistic. Acceleration is a bit quicker, and maneuverability degrades more with speed than it does in Madness. In Madness you can keep the accelerator mashed while you turn and cruise through the track, but in Mania you'll have to learn to apply the brake or ease the accelerator often. If the riders don't look as smooth as those in Madness, they appear to have bodies modeled on a real skeletal structure because their animations seem more articulate when they ride on the bike. Their limbs also flop around like bags full of shattered bones after a wipeout.   Motocross Mania is thus more demanding of you, but gets better with practice and in some ways is better than Motocross Madness. As you play, you'll appreciate the track designs that offer numerous opportunities to grab air over some ramps and jumps in the wilderness. The environments are well done and dense with vegetation and elevation changes, where the fields of Madness tend to be more flat and open. Indoor arenas are similar to those in the Madness, but some feature jumping stunts over obstacles like semi trucks. I also liked the use of spotlights around the stadium.   There's one other feature that adds a lot of replay value, even if unintended. You can switch Mania to a first person perspective. In some ways it's harder to play because you can't get the visual cues you get from a chase camera about when your biker is about to slip, or where he is in relation to other objects. But it's a different game when you play from this vantage. It's too bad you can't pan your head around and enjoy the view from the apex of a jump.  Mania has a console mentality in some areas, however, and some PC players may not care for that. Some tracks must be unlocked by winning races before you can play them. In addition, Mania's stunts are sometimes tough to perform because they're like console fighting moves, with combination inputs that involve holding down one or two buttons and triggering two direction inputs. I found stunt execution difficult with a joystick, but a gamepad or keyboard combination might work better.   I tried out multiplayer via GameSpy. Unlike the GameSpy debacle of Codename Eagle, where the included GameSpy software didn't really support the game, Mania installs a version of GameSpy Arcade that's ready to roll. I was quickly attached to GameSpy, and was even able to download the latest patches for both GameSpy Arcade and Motocross Mania. In short, the included GameSpy support is excellent, and even though the documentation asks for a minimum of a 33.6kbps connection, I could play a game at 26.4kpbs, albeit a laggy one.  If you love dirt biking and find Motocross Madness too easy, then Motocross Mania has what you're looking for. Deibus has done a good job with this one, but casual racers should be aware the game is less forgiving than the Microsoft offering.   -- Bernie Dy      Want to share your opinions with the world?
