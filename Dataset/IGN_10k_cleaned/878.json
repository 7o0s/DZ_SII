That's all you need for a successful 2D shooter in the land of the rising sun, and the number of games that have followed this formula borders on the obscene. The words ~wacky~ and ~cutesy~ go hand-in-hand with just about any retro shoot-em-up that's come out of either Capcom or SNK - and Twinkle Star Sprites is no different.  This particular ~shmup~ is based on a Neo-Geo game from ADK, released in 1996.  It's your standard top-down 2D shooter, but with a twist -- instead of simply taking off and blasting the hell out of anything that moves, you go up against an opponent at the same time. The presentation is split-screen, so you can see what your crafty foe is up to at all times. Your goal is to rack up combo moves with Chain Explosions -- if you blast a pack of incoming enemies without missing a shot, they'll head over to your opponent's screen and start causing havoc. Once your enemy loses all of his hearts, you're declared the winner.  Each player has a set number of Bomb Coins, which can be traded in for a generic, screen-filling Attack of Mass Destruction(tm). But what's really cool are the Boss Attacks -- once you jack your combo meter up to level three, you can summon a monstrosity to irritate your opponent to no avail. ~Attack stoppers~ can be used by holding down the fire button, and firing into the middle of an enemy group.  Unlike the majority of 2D shooters, Twinkle Star Sprites isn't much fun in solo play -- you basically slog your way through a series of AI opponents. Neither ~Story Mode~ or ~Character Mode~ are that appealing for long-term play. But the game really shines when you've got another buddy playing along -- this is a great way for two shooter fans to contest their ~mad skillz~ head-to-head, instead of playing separately and comparing high scores.  Despite solid competitive play, Twinkle Star Sprites may be too retro-looking for most gamers' palates. Everything is presented in the Dreamcast's low-resolution Chunk-O-Vision, and the graphics (rather obviously) scream ~1996 Neo-Geo Game.~ If you're expecting something to rival Sega's Geist Force demo, you may be a mite disappointed.  Though a four-year lead-time wasn't enough for SNK to redraw the art in high resolution, there are a good number of extra options. This includes the ability to select original arcade or CD-quality background music, trace recording for playing back those nice combo moves, and a fix for an arcade scoring bug. Weirder still is the speed control, which you can toggle between Dreamcast (no slowdown), Neo-Geo (some slowdown), and 68000 10MhZ (hideous slowdown).   But, as always, the best feature is the language option, which results in some of the most hilarious SNK-glish ever. Twinkle Star Sprites features such advice as ~Attack charachtes [sic] fly at your opponentos [sic],~  and ~The bigger the enemy golem is the longer it.~ I don't understand the Spanish translation, but I get the feeling that it's hilarious too. Twinkle Star Sprites is an okay little 2D shoot-em-up with remotely enjoyable competitive play, and chances are good that it won't hit the States any time soon. As always, if you're into the shooter genre (and imported Giga Wing and Gunbird 2), you'll probably get a kick out of this -- as for the rest of us, we'll stick it out for a new Panzer Dragoon. -- Colin ~Let's shoot!~ Williamson, IGN", "date": "Apr 19, 2000"}
