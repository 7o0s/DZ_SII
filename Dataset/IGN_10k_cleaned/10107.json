The consensus is that it possesses ~little coherence and lackluster special effects.~ The same can be said about the videogame tie-in, Jumper: Griffin's Story, making it a bad game based on a bad movie. The gameplay is a mind-numbing beat 'em up affair and the visuals are of Nintendo 64 quality.  There is the occasional glimpse of fun, but these mirages fade almost immediately.   The game focuses on the jumper Griffin, who is a supporting character in the movie. Publisher Brash Entertainment is up front about its target demographic being casual gamers and fans of the film. This is evident in the lack of any story explanation in the game or manual. You are apparently expected to have seen the movie and know who these characters are going in. ~Story~ is in the title for cryin' out loud. All we know is Griffin's parents were killed, he's pissed, and he takes House of Pain literally.   Jumper is a total button masher. You run from room to room getting into fights with Paladins who are jealous that they can't jump around.  The A and B buttons attack and you press the analog stick in different directions to jump around the enemy.  But there isn't any technique or strategy involved -- just furiously press your buttons and swivel the analog stick and you'll take down legions and legions of bad guys, who are all apparently identical twins.  Jamie Bell, the actor who plays Griffin in the film and lends his voice to the game, even remarks at one point, ~Have we met?  I've killed so many guys just like you it's hard to keep track.~  I'd like to think the developers added the line as a knowing wink to the poor gamer facing his/her 10,000th wave of the same enemies.   As he connects his blows, Griffin will charge his jump meter.  When full, players can press the minus button to activate a jump attack.  This might be a slow-motion jump kick, or it might trigger a short cut scene where Griffin ~jumps~ the enemy to a dangerous location and finishes him off.  For example, he'll jump to the top of a tall building and throw the bad guy off the edge.  These vignettes would be more entertaining if there was more variety.  Instead, you'll be seeing the same handful over and over again.  There are more elaborate kill sequences where the game goes on rails and takes control away from the player.  These are fairly inventive but the graphics and collision detection are so bad the experience will likely be ruined for you.     Characters are terribly animated.  Turning around is done by spinning in place without moving your legs.  When they engage in conversation, their mouths don't move.  All the people in Jumper are cel-shaded, but the environments aren't.  I would rather have seen the entire game take on a comic book look.  As they are, the environments are very bland.   One gameplay mechanic that is actually fun is jumping around an area.  Hold the C button and aim the Wii Remote at any level ground in view.  Release the C button and Griffin will teleport to that spot.  There are a few clever spots where the player must jump to a difficult area to obtain an item.  The aiming reticule can be hard to see, though, as it is a light blue and becomes lost in the background.   The camera has many problems.  It's nice that we can control it with the D-pad, but we can't be specific when moving it up or down.  It can either be moved all the way up, or all the way down, then it snaps back into place.  Not very helpful.  There also isn't any way to center the camera behind Griffin.   You have to press the 2 button to pick up and switch weapons.  Anyone who has held a Wii Remote can tell you that this isn't the easiest button to access on the controller.  Especially when you attack with the A button, having to pull your thumb away and stretch it to the opposite side of the controller to change weapons just isn't convenient.   Jumper's music is pretty good, composed by Chris Tilton (Mercenaries, Black).  It's a dramatic, orchestral affair, not based on the music of the film, but of Hollywood action movie quality.   The options menu offers a lengthy amount of stats that track your progress through the game.  You can check in here to see how many secrets you've found, weapons you've mastered, and how many people you've killed with each armament.  It's a nice little touch that invests the player in the game just a tiny bit more.This is the epitomy of a movie tie-in hack job. Low production values, monotonous gameplay, and lackluster visuals make this a story you can jump past.  It's a shame, because the concept opens up a million gameplay opportunities.  How can the ability to teleport be boring?  With this and Alvin & the Chipmunks under its belt, publisher Brash is really not off to a good start.", "date": "Feb 29, 2008"}
