Japan gets them -- the genre is wildly popular at home and in the arcades over there, with online competition in PC games and gigantic electronic betting parlors taking up hefty chunks of arcade real estate -- but as a rule, the rest of the world does not.  It's understandable on the surface, since from the perspective of most, horse-racing is just another game of chance, and as such isn't any fun without the reality of competition and risk surrounding it.  But that's the surface, of course.  If your area of interest lies in the complex strategies of breeding, stable management, and finally the race at the very end of a long and tiring process, this may be the game for you.  Tecmo has, after all, put a fantastic amount of effort into creating a detailed simulation.  There are dozens of races, thousands of different horses, and goodness knows how many options as far as cosmetic customization for your horse and jockey.  The 3D graphics engine does a great job with weather and lighting effects in addition to crafting good-looking horse-models.  The level of interactivity in the actual races is low, but like any complex sim, Gallop Racer has genuine addictive potential, providing you can get past the initial ~it's a horse-racing game?~ barrier.  If you can't, well, that's your own lookout.  Gameplay  If you want to look at horses, breed horses, train horses, watch horses wait the long while until there's a race they can actually enter, and send horses back to the stable after a crushing defeat, here's your game.  It helps if you get a kick out of customizing jockey silks, too.  There is a multitude of options available to the enterprising trainer for all those different features, and a total of 1,500 different horses in the database altogether (with 1,500 different inexplicably silly names, too).  The game flows from purchase through training into racing, and from there to a variety of other secondary possibilities -- you can breed your horses, rest them for a while, or sell them to pick up new ones.  What some players will have a hard time getting past is the indirect nature of the control in the races proper.  You have just enough of a handle on making your horse do what you want that it becomes very, very frustrating when they decide to bug out and do their own thing, which usually amounts to dropping well into the back of the pack.  Lateral movement is usually hindered by the pack, movement forward and back is thwarted in the early stages of the game by most beginning horses' dislike for the head of the pack, and the quirt controls have a very random effect (again, affected by the horse's personality).  But that is, after all, a realistic representation of a jockey's dilemma -- a horse doesn't just come with a throttle and a brake.  The limited controls also force you to deal with a horse's particular tendencies and develop them in the areas where they're weak.  The game won't let you overcome ineptitude at the simulation side of things with superior twitching skills.  The gambling elements, unfortunately, nothing particularly interesting.  There's not even any virtual representation of money -- you just play for ~points,~ like playing stud poker for matchsticks.  There's nothing to win or lose, hence no excitement, hence why bother?  But the gambling system isn't the point of the game in the slightest.  You can easily ignore it and still appreciate the game as it was meant to be played, as a breeder's simulation rather than a player's.  Graphics  Gallop Racer is a very pretty simulation, both the 3D graphics of the races themselves and the interface design of the bits where you'll actually be spending the majority of your time.  The menu system is clean, simple, and quite pretty, with excellent animation and transition, to say nothing of the young woman who serves as your guide through the game.  Why is there a cute girl in a lavender minidress inhabiting nearly every menu screen?  Well, just because.  I see no particular reason to complain.    The races themselves have a perfect framerate, good-looking jockey and horse models, decent arenas, and great weather effects.  Snow and rain sail past your viewpoint in pleasantly realistic fashion, in addition to having an effect on the outcome of the race (since some horses are better in the wet than others).  There are plenty of different camera angles on offer, so if you don't necessarily enjoy the view of a horse's nether regions, you can switch to a higher angle, top-down view, or some other more pleasant perspective on the action.   Sorry about the lack of the Sound category.  What's there to say?  There's nice soothing music in the menu screens, and that's just about it.  Not knocking the importance of soothing music or anything, but it would be a little silly to have an entire big heading to just say ~Wow!  Soothing music!~Ahem.  Gallop Racer 2001, as I say, is one of those things you may reject utterly.  There is nothing wrong with this -- plenty of people reject flight simulations, train simulations, city simulations, war simulations, dating simulations, and plenty of other simulations of activities that just don't happen to interest them.  You've got to wonder about those guys who aren't interested in the dating sims, but I digress...Gallop Racer is a horse-racing simulation, and you may want to evaluate it just on that basis -- do I like horse racing?  If you do, go forth and enjoy.  But it's not necessarily a game that should be restricted to a tiny enthusiast base, because like any well-made simulation it has the potential to transcend its subject matter.  Any good sim can become addictive, absorbing the player in its little world of rules and goals, regardless of exactly what is being simulated.Thus, Gallop Racer is worthy of attention if you'd like to try something different, not to mention its potential as a hot Ebay sale (Tecmo is releasing only a small print run).  Just don't take out your frustration on the horse if it isn't your cup of tea, and please don't hassle me about it, eitther.", "date": "Sep 5, 2001"}
