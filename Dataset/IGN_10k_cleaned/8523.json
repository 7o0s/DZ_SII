Plagued by horrible controls, lame on-foot sections and stupid AI, the franchise has been mired in mediocrity for a long time.  What was needed was a serious change, and so last year, the old formula behind the action title was scrapped in favor of a GTA-light style experience.  This produced last year's somewhat improved Driver: Parallel Lines, and gave a little hope that the series was headed back to prominence.  Hoping to capitalize on this turnaround, as well as some of the characters from Parallel Lines, Sumo Digital and Ubisoft recently released Driver '76, a prequel to Parallel Lines.  Unfortunately, this portable version resurrects just about every issue that previous games in the series have suffered from.   If you've played Parallel Lines, you might expect Driver '76 to provide more information about the earlier years of TK, the wheelman who gets set up, imprisoned and embarks on a mission of revenge many years later.  That would be a good guess, but a wrong one, as Driver '76 is about Slink the Pimp and Ray the mechanic, two supporting characters from that console title.  Set two years before the start of Parallel Lines, the story focuses on Ray's start as a wheelman on the streets of New York, racing cars and getting into trouble.  However, Ray has a major problem, because he's fallen for Chen-Chi, the daughter of the city's Triad boss, Zhou.  Knowing that Zhou won't consider Ray worthy to date his daughter, Ray attempts to gather presents and money so he can impress the mobster.   Pimp, meet hippie.  Hippie, meet pimp. To fulfill his quest, Ray will hit the streets of New York City and New Jersey, looking for various jobs to take on.  You won't actually jump into a car and ride around looking for missions to take on; instead, before each job you'll consult a map that will provide you with a briefing on the task that's required.  Some of these are pretty simple, such as getting to a specific point before time runs out, while others can be somewhat complicated, like getting gang members to follow you to police headquarters so both sides can shoot it out while you get away.  As you're taking on these jobs, you're supposed to keep an eye out for your heat meter surrounding the mini-map at the bottom right hand side of the screen.  This is supposed to give you a sense of whether or not the police are after you for vehicular or on foot crimes, for those moments when you jump out of the car and start attacking people.    I say supposed to because the police in Driver '76 are quite possibly some of the stupidest AI controlled characters that I've ever seen.  You quite literally have to perform something egregious in front of them to make them chase you, such as cause a head-on collision or fire multiple bullets at someone.  On the other hand, speeding, reckless driving or crashing through fences, lampposts or barriers literally receive a blind eye.  However, once you've actually gotten them on your heels, it's pathetically easy to get them to drop their pursuit.  If you can establish a lead of two blocks, the police will quickly decide that they've lost sight of you, even if you're immediately in front of them and they happen to have a police helicopter providing support above them.  How the hell are you able to confuse the copter which should be able to tell the cops on the ground where you are?  This can be a bit more time-consuming with some of the earlier cars, but as you start unlocking some of the various sports cars, you can blaze through police chases in ten seconds flat.   Cops won't chase a man in a good muscle car.  Everyone knows that. Anyway, regardless of the mission difficulty or cops that you leave in the dust, you'll receive a default vehicle that you will use to perform your crime, which is often added to your garage at the end as a reward for your service.  You'll also receive cash for your pains, which can only be used to upgrade your vehicle or acquire weapons and ammunition that you'll use in gunfights.  Money has no impact on Ray's chances to impress Zhou, so you can easily collect more than you'll ever hope to spend, making it relatively worthless.  You won't be spending it on new vehicles, and the vehicle upgrades aren't particularly useful. For one thing, the handling of most of the machines doesn't radically change if you buy new shocks, springs, brakes or body work, so muscle cars and trucks will still be more unwieldy on the road compared to sports cars or motorcycles.  What's more, while you can boost the speed of your vehicles, you don't really need to, nor do you need to purchase nitro boosts either to accomplish a majority of job objectives.  Even the slowest machine is good enough to get you from point A to B with enough speed.    You won't constantly find yourself behind the wheel though.  At any point in time, you can jump out of cars and hijack other vehicles, as well as get out and blast opponents with any of the firearms that you've acquired.  To help you out, the game provides a target lock for opponents that you can use to pick off enemies. The biggest problem here is that you'll rarely find that the weapons pack any serious punch -- it's possible to pour more than thirty bullets from an AK-47 or Uzi knockoff into someone that's literally two or three feet away from them and they won't go down.  The ineffectiveness of the weapons are highlighted when you are trying to repel incoming enemies from the back of a car and you empty four or five clips on only two gunmen that appear to resist head shots and other targeted fire. Even worse is the fact that the majority of story missions that require you to kill enemies on foot will only throw three armed combatants at you.  This isn't a challenge; it's a waste of time as you see how many bullets miss you and how many you can fire before they fall.   If you happen to get tired with flying through the main quest missions over the extremely short six chapter storyline, which can be beaten in less than six hours, you can take on some of the various side missions scattered around the city.  These include tasks such as delivery missions, checkpoint and lap races and demolition derbies.  Again, these provide heaps of money, much more than you will ever be able to spend in the game, so after a while, you'll quickly lose interest in performing these tasks.  Unless you've got a need to complete every single aspect of the game, there's really no need to ever enter one of these events.    Welcome to the 3 Blind Mice shooting gallery, where no one can hit anything! What's slightly more interesting is the collectible system implemented in Driver '76.  Scattered around the world are stars, such as suspended over ramps or hidden behind corners.  Driving over the items will randomly unlock various items, like keychains, t-shirts, paint jobs and other objects. But the novelty quickly wears thin once you realize that, apart from the paint schemes, there's no reason to ever grab these items.  They have no impact on either the character or the game: even if you managed to get different shirts or jeans, Ray and Slink won't ever wear them in the game.  They're also presented more like baseball cards, which can be traded with another owner of Driver '76 if you're so inclined. In fact, the game's limited multiplayer is set up for buddy play, with four different game types over Ad Hoc play.  While you can play a standard game, players will have the opportunity to race for pink slips if they're interested, potentially giving them an edge on their story mode competition when they start playing the regular game.   One thing that players will have to become accustomed to, regardless of whether they play through the story, side missions or multiplayer are the absurd load times for Driver '76.  Part of this is because the game features two separate load screens: one that can take up to a minute to load initial data, and a secondary screen with a UMD access logo on it.  The game isn't exactly pushing the envelope as it renders New York or New Jersey.  It's also not trying to stream the cities either, as the game will freeze for up to five seconds as it accesses the UMD during lengthy drives.  Plus, if you need to retry a mission for any reason, you have to reload all over again, which is ridiculous.  It's a mystery as to what's taking so long: the game can't be tracking the limited car deformation, and the streets aren't exactly teeming with pedestrians or vehicular traffic.   If that's all that's on the street, what's up with the load times? At least the presentation of the story, told in graphic novel format cutscenes, is visually engaging.  The situations that Ray and Slink manage to get into are pretty unbelievable, but it feels just right within the graphic novel context.  While the visuals aren't overly strong, the sound is probably the standout of the game.  The dialogue is decently presented, and the soundtrack, with songs from David Bowie, Blondie and Iggy Pop, is great to listen to as you drive around from place to place.  It's just too bad that a lot of the other sound effects, like the guns and various engines, are really weak by comparison.Driver '76 needs to have the keys and car taken away from it before it does harm to PSPs everywhere.  Idiotic police AI, an extremely short story mode, useless collectables, weak on-foot combat and appalling load times all conspire to make this the weakest installment in the franchise. Don't do this to yourself if you need a racer or action title; there's plenty of games on the PSP that will appease you better than this one.", "date": "May 24, 2007"}
