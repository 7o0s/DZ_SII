This phenomenon seemed to be rooted in the premise of its combined action elements, realtime battle engine, and the immersion of an RPG. Unfortunately, the result of this hybrid wasn't perfect by a long shot. The result was in fact standard, and the game slipped from the top spot the following week.   So how does this bode for the American version? Well, it's not as condemning as it sounds, by far.  Granstream Saga, released by THQ in the US, is by all means an adequate step into the role-playing realm. An engrossing story featuring a very linear quest follows the adventures of a young man named Eon. Eon's mysterious past, which includes being found at the foot of a shrine with a strange bracelet, called a Sceptre, already adorning his arm, makes him destined to be a hero. His adopted grandfather's wish is for Eon to save the world (not exactly as easy as: ~Eon, can you take out the garbage?~) by collecting precious stones from a handful of 'floating continents' which are in danger of falling to the murky depths below.   His journey pairs him up with two love interests and whole strange cast of characters. The story, itself, while it doesn't contain the most inspired plotline, does its job in keeping a steady pace of progression throughout the game.   But, to somewhat remedy the lack of depth in the game's characters and storyline, Granstream does contain some rather beautiful anime sequences. Superbly voiced and nicely animated, the cinemas provide good relief from the linear gameplay. And the gameplay certainly does have its polar moments of both brilliance and dullness. While the fighting is certainly a different take on RPG battles, the slowdown of having to process completely polygonal characters and enemies can be a drag (no pun intended). And because of the high frame rate (60 fps) and polygon count, the facial details of characters are left blank -- a real disappointment. Instead, hand-drawn depictions of characters are featured at the top of textboxes. This can be a little unsettling at times, but after a few hours into the game you may no longer notice the strangeness of the game's look.   The most innovative aspect of the game is its battle engine. And while it is certainly refreshing to be able to carry out real moves or counterattacks during a battle (instead of simply pressing one button), the engine is much too simple. The result is the player using one move, over and over, while the enemies have a very limited repertoire of attacks, as well. A complex idea is compromised because of the limitations of the hardware and developers. This is somewhat disappointing, but it certainly isn't a deathblow to the game.   Though somewhat short in length (around 20 or so hours for an average player), the game does sport enough redeeming factors to draw the gamer in for awhile. Beautiful cinemas, a straightforward quest and an innovative battle engine may hook some RPG fans in for a spin, but don't expect a flawless experience.
