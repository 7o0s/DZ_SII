As much as it's had its share of problems over the years, it's hard not to genuinely care for it in a strange ~I love watching sea monkeys grow~ kind of way. It's almost always had charm along with some decent gameplay features, but never quite managed to put together enough successes to scale that wall of greatness. Settlers has even gone so far as to slide backwards in recent iterations. Happily the latest attempt by Blue Byte, The Settlers: Rise of an Empire, is one of the best so far and definitely better than The Heritage of Kings. It's one of the easiest in the series to get into and has the best visuals the series has ever seen. It's still got some problems with trading, combat, and pacing, but the overall package is pretty decent.   The main gist of the game remains pretty loyal to Settlers of yore. Build up a settlement, harvest resources, expand outward, train some soldiers to defend, and create the best and safest place for your life-loving melon-headed subjects that you can. It's a simple system and one that's hard for some gamers to find entertainment in, but tends to be endearing for those of us that enjoy watching towns sprout from nothing but a patch of dirt.     It definitely helps that this is the most complete package we've seen in Settlers history. Whereas Heritage of Kings was good technically but offered up very little personality, Rise of an Empire has plenty of personality as the series has moved back to bright and cheery colors and cartoony characters with big heads and great animations. The detail afforded to all of the structures is pretty great. Everything from the architecture to the settlers hanging out the window pounding out the laundry adds something to look at. Seeing your settlement grow in size and become a bustling little town is definitely fun.    Of the big features changed in Settlers, my favorite is perhaps that maps are divided into several territories. Each of these territories have resources associated with them including wood, metal, fertile land, or some sort of food source. In order to be able to take advantage of any of those resources players have to go out and place an outpost down, which costs resources and money, which will force players to explore and think about where to spend their beginning resources to expand rather than just claim the first territory to come along. Other players (human or AI) can try and take this outpost by damaging it enough to capture it. This simple mechanic will help players get out of their starting city, capture land and be forced to defend it, which is a good thing as lazy good for nothings are boring to play against.   The big problem with and otherwise good mechanic is that every building and road in the territory blows up once the territory changes hands. Not only is it aggravating to the guy that built it (as it probably should be), but also the guy attacking. I'd just as soon take all of the structures as my glorious prize for assaulting the enemy and would prefer it if it was an option to convert the settlers there or simply kick out the old settlers, keep the buildings, and choose which ones for my settlers to inhabit.     The knight is another good addition in theory. You'll pick one in each mission or multiplayer match and the choice will likely influence the way you play. Each has special abilities, one passive and one active, that will help your settlement though their abilities seem pretty out of balance. I don't understand why anyone would play with a knight other than Hakim who has the most useful abilities by far.   The rest has been simplified from Settlers past to cut down on any last micromanagement issues. This includes the move to combine housing and work buildings together, which is actually a very pleasant change. You'll see the residences above the businesses, which does make sense for a bustling city, and the combination of meandering streets radiating out from the town square and vertical buildings is definitely eye-catching.  These structures can be upgraded to hold more settlers and increase the production speed of whatever their harvesting or making. Strangely that has the opposite effect of what you'd expect. It actually decreases the amount consumed of various goods when more people live there. It doesn't make a lot of sense and means there's zero reason not to upgrade each building immediately. It's pretty strange since there's a good relationship between goods obtained, manufactured and consumed for the most part.   Resource harvesting has also been streamlined to require way less management and frustration. Raw materials, other than trees, are found in set locations. Just place a harvest structure down next to the resource and the settlers will get to it. They'll resource the hell out of whatever they're supposed to until there isn't any more at which point you'll hear a message ~A settler can't find any game to hunt~ or some such thing. This keeps the little guys from wandering too far around the map looking for more of the same resources and allows you the chance to simply tear the building down and use the resources and manpower elsewhere. Doubled with roads, which are easily drawn around the map, the system works very well and allows you concentrate on higher level strategies. Basically, the aggravation of managing menial settler tasks from previous games has been eliminated.    Unfortunately the system is efficient enough that it also means that you'll be sitting around a lot simply waiting for resources to come in since there's no fiddling with output rates of production buildings or the option to simply shut a building down. I would have imagined with the streamlined construction and harvesting methods that the objectives, especially in the single player campaign, would have been a bit more challenging from an economic/trade or diplomatic standpoint. Instead, most objectives are incredibly easy to fill once your city is up and running since they're largely centered on delivering small amounts of easily obtained goods to friendly villages or some easily overcome military objectives.   The amount of fun provided in single player campaign missions is pretty wild. The pacing is just screwed up. The first half of the game spends too much time being friendly without much of a challenge of any sort. The second half gets a little trickier with some resource challenges and some small military objectives. The biggest problem with this is that the scaling up doesn't help deal with the last missions that are suddenly much more difficult and pressing. You'll enter the missions and simply fail because there's no hint that you need to step up your game since all of the missions up to then were so easy.     It probably doesn't help that trade and diplomacy are incredibly simple and hardly ever required or even really encouraged. Nearly every map we've played has an abundant amount of resources to be found and picking up some extra supplies really only matters in dire circumstances if you forgot to build enough of one type of structure. If certain types of goods could only be bartered for or if other villages required certain goods to trade instead of simple coin, objectives might have been more complex and fulfilling. It's just such a brain dead approach to an idea like trade that could be involved and interesting. The same can be said for diplomacy, which is basically non-existent. There's no making or breaking of alliances, only a notice telling you if they're enemies or not and what goods they have for trade. There's no gifting or demanding of goods or even requesting goods or money or anything else that might be considered diplomatic which could have helped make a more interesting challenge.   It's especially disappointing since later missions start focusing more on combat, which may be better than some previous Settlers titles but is still pretty sad by strategy standards. Units will run around in a jumble, and won't always respond to enemies in the area. Walls and towers offer virtually no protection versus archers on the ground and catapults can't attack soldiers, only walls and buildings. It's simple to the extreme. If the game is going to focus as much as it does on military, it's got to be better.   The campaign follows you as an upstart king from a small island seeking to do good in the world while you butt heads against the Red Prince and his tramp general Crimson Sabatt. They're pretty typical bad guys, but it's hard not to understand their ridiculousness in the Settlers setting and is actually appreciated. The campaign is pretty long, if dull at points. The addition of extra single player scenarios only helps the amount of game available from a single player standpoint. There are a couple of types for those that just want to build a settlement and those that want quest driven gameplay. Just be forewarned that Rise of an Empire is not without bugs. I've come across a gigantic save bug that occasionally keeps me from saving at all in the middle of a mission. Put on top of that the occasional crashes to desktop and you have a wicked combination that can cost you an hour or more worth of game time.   You should also be very careful about playing and then patching the game. There's an autopatch necessary for multiplayer that will make any saves played incompatible. In fact, they won't even show up in the saved game list in the menu. While the game will still recognize campaign progression in your profile, you won't be able to load into any particular save game. Bad. Bad. Bad.     If you have the ability to jump online and play, there's a wealth of opportunity here as well, despite the terrible lobby system. Players will jostle for territory on some interesting maps while attacking to deny territory or simply annihilate the competition altogether. With three ways to win (which can be turned on or off) players can choose different routes. One game I played, all I had to do was hold off a couple of enemies (my teammate dropped off) that we're uselessly throwing basic military units against me while I advanced all the way up the ranks to the title of Archduke by providing my settlers all their needs. Frankly, they could have killed me had they known what they were doing, but there are peaceful ways to victory here. The problem is twofold. First, the auto-updater wouldn't install the patch (which you have to have to play online at all) correctly so I had to dig around to find and install the patch myself. Second, there really aren't very many people online to play with. If you've got a friend that appreciates big head happy fun, then you're in for some good relaxing fun.Despite being the best game in the series because of some lovely visuals and good gameplay enhancements, The Settlers: Rise of an Empire still manages to screw enough things up to be aggravating. The game is decent to be sure and borders on being a truly good game, but a lack of trade and diplomatic functionality are absolutely frustrating on top of a very basic combat design that isnt good enough for the amount of combat forced upon players. The huge problem, of course, is the save and crash bugs that can keep you from finishing some of the long missions. If youre willing to deal with the bugs and like charming town building games like this one, its definitely worth a try. We at least recommend giving the demo a look.", "date": "Oct 1, 2007"}
