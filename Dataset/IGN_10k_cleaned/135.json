Nintendo's 12-year old water sports game is prettier, more fun, and cheaper than Kawasaki Jet Ski.  Even for hardcore jet heads, there is no reason to take Bold's latest shovelware offering for a spin.   Riding a real jet ski is a lot of fun.  Videogames that ask you to virtually participate in something we can all do in real life need to throw in some extra incentive to play.  Sure, not everyone owns a jet ski or lives near water.  But if what you're offering instead is an ugly, frustrating experience that controls nothing like the real thing -- what's the point?   What we've got here is a bare bones racing game with very simple controls (although they still manage to be awkward), four characters, and a few paltry game modes. We have to wonder what the developers think slapping the Kawasaki license onto the game adds to the experience.  Come to think of it, why would Kawasaki want to be associated with tripe like this?  Players aren't getting a very favorable impression of the company's products.  It's even misleading -- here, the jet skis stop on a dime.     Like most cheap racing cash-ins on the Wii, steering is done by tilting the Remote.  But it hasn't been refined to the point of something like Excite Truck.  The good news is that Kawasaki controls slightly better than Bold's other crapfest, Classic British Motor Racing.  Of course, that's not saying a whole lot.  For a casual game that users are supposed to be able to ~pick up and play,~ these jet skis are a burdensome frustration.  When you inevitably run into a wall you'll find yourself stuck there, unable to turn away.  On one occasion, after struggling to free ourselves from the clutches of the track edge, the game dropped us outside the course.  We had no way to get back into the race and had to restart.   If you have any enemies you could bring them in for some versus multiplayer.  For some reason, this brings the game to its knees, the framerate drops, and the action slows down considerably.  There's even a good deal of lag when the announcer counts down at the start of the race.  Three-two-one flashes on screen but they don't match up to his voice.  The race doesn't get going until a few seconds after he says, ~go!~  We also have to note that the announcer has one of the most ridiculous videogame voices we've heard in some time.   Part of what made Wave Race so impressive back in the day was the eye-popping water effects.  These days there are a lot of games that do water well, even on the less-powerful Wii.  Kawasaki Jet Ski is not one of them, though.  The water spray looks terrible.  Only the bare minimum of interactivity is present -- there aren't even splashes when you land a jump.What it comes down to is that Bold/Destineer must know very well its games are terrible.  It preys on the ignorance of grandparents and uninformed soccer moms who see Kawasaki Jet Ski in the bargain bin of the checkout line.  They see the Kawasaki brand name, and think they're getting a great deal on a jet ski game for their kids or grandkids.  What do you judge a game on?  Its ~fun factor?~  Its graphics/sound?  Its presentation?  Kawasaki Jet Ski fails in each category.  In no way does it serve as any sort of substitute for the real thing.", "date": "Apr 4, 2008"}
