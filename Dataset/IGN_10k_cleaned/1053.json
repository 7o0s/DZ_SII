Unlike the IGN64 wondertwins, Japanese import games starring strange, big-eyed girls with bunny ears shooting time-traveling tentacle monsters don't scare me. Perhaps it's because I've spent a large portion of my life in Tokyo -- but I just can't pass up games with such illustrious names as Muteki Bakuretsu Bangaioh or Gendai Dai-Senryaku (although I try to stay away from Anoop's ~interactive~ anime stuff that's got as much in common with gaming as hiring green midgets to follow you around at game expos). Imagine my delight when I was able to get a hold of Taito 's Densha De Go for the N64, complete with the enticing (and costly) Densha De Go train controller.Sadly, my delight soon turned to boredom when I found that driving Japanese subways and JR trains is just as dull as actually sitting in them every morning when commuting to work.Densha De Go 64, which translates to ~Go By Train~, is the latest installment in the long-running series of train simulators that for some inexplicable reason manage to pop up in the Japanese sales Top 10s whenever they hit a new platform. Appealing to a much older demographic than the actual N64 console in Japan (which explains why this particular version DIDN'T sell), Densha De Go lets you man the controls of some of the more well-known train lines throughout the island. Ranging from Shinkansen bullet trains to Tokyo's famous Yamanote-sen (one of the most crowded places to be on a workday morning), Densha De Go certainly isn't skimpy on officially licensed trains.Utilizing this fancy Densha De Go controller (sold separately), players get to fulfill their childhood dreams and drive through Tokyo, Osaka and the Japanese country side, trying to stick to predefined train schedules and stop at all the right stations. The game is full of meticulous details. Not only do all the trains and stops correspond to the real-life ones, but you can actually drive the different permutations, including local trains, limited express trains, express trains and more. The difference between them is that local trains stop at every station, whereas express trains skip the smaller stops. Anyone who's been to Japan has probably experienced that disconcerting feeling of seeing your train rocket past the station you wanted to get off at. Don't worry, it happens to everyone once. Sadly, while the stations resemble their real-life counterparts, the graphics are overly blurry with rather ugly textures and tons flicker. To make things worse, every station looks deserted  as if Godzilla had marched right through Tokyo and eaten every single pedestrian from Shinagawa to Akasaka.The game is played from a first-person view that shows you the track in front of you, part of the cockpit of the train (complete with windshield wipers) and a number of HUD displays. To drive the trains, you move the left lever on the controller forward (the higher the number, the faster the train goes), to brake, you pull it down and move up the right brake lever instead. That's it. Well, theoretically. If there is one thing I learned from Densha De Go about driving trains it's that it takes a lot of effort to stop one of these things. Drivers usually accelerate to a high speed, then disengage the accelerator and let the train roll until a certain point, at which the brakes are applied steadily until you come to a halt. You can't just speed into a station and start braking at the last moment. The idea is to follow all railway signals, slow down for speed limits, stop for red lights and sound the horn for overpasses, then stop at the relevant stations in time. To get a perfect score, you have to a) follow all the rules and drive smoothly, b) meet the schedule and c) the front of the train has to line up at the front marker of the station, which allows your passengers to get off comfortably and in the right spot. If you brake too much (or even engage the emergency brakes), a small screen pops up showing a cheesy 2D animation of a disgruntled passenger  that means points off. Miss your scheduled stop and the emergency stop system is engaged (accompanied by a blood-curdling alarm sound) and you will be penalized as well.In addition to the special controller, Densha De Go also supports the Voice Recognition Pak that originally shipped with Pikachu Genki Dechu (Hey You, Pikachu! in the US). Interaction is limited to announcing departure and signals. Do it right and you are awarded with bonus points. However, the voice recognition is a little moody at times. While it had no problem understanding my ~Shuppatsu Shinkou~, it often didn't work when my wife said it -- which comes as a bit of a surprise, since she's a native Japanese speaker... I guess it's designed for male train drivers only.Let's get right down to it. Driving videogame trains is dull. I enjoyed seeing the familiar scenery, making passengers fall over by braking too hard and unlocking new trains, but the interaction and the actual gameplay is far too limited to last. Sure, there is the occasional bonus game that has you drive as close to another train as possible and sounding the horn never fails to instill a certain Homer Simpson-like glee in me, but there's just not enough to do. It would have been nice if the game would let you at least open and close the doors, announce the next stop (and use the voice recognition to give you points for getting it right) or cause a nice fiery train crash if you go too fast... And what's up with not being able to switch into reverse? In real life, Japanese JR trains and subways back up quite frequently when they overshoot the target line -- Densha De Go's trains can't do that. I don't care how highly Famitsu and co. tend to rate the Densha De Go games. These titles are neither accurate simulations nor enjoyable arcade videogames. They are, however, an interesting attempt to create a game unlike any other and fulfill some Japanese kids' dream of driving a train. Turns out this dream becomes old VERY quickly.The game requires moderate Japanese reading AND speaking abilities (if you want to make use of the voice recognition).
