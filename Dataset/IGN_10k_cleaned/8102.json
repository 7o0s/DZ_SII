Simulating the whole conflict across the entire globe and including grognard-friendly features like supply and transport, the original game served as an easy introduction to wargames. Still, it sold players short in terms of diplomacy and espionage and suffered a bit from a too rigid adherence to history. This new version hopes to address some of those weaknesses while also tossing in new Cold War scenario for good measure.  Rather than re-reviewing the basic game here, we're going to focus just on the additions present in A World Divided. Readers who are interested in finding out more about the game mechanics, graphics and other features of the original game can check out that review here.   A World Divided includes an East vs. West scenario that simulates the hypothetical outbreak of hostilities between the USSR and the Western powers following the defeat of Germany. Starting in the summer of 1946 and ending ten turns later in the winter of 1948, the new scenario lets players choose either side of the conflict. The Soviets have control of Eastern Europe, the Allies have control over Western Europe and the former Japanese Empire.  The main conflict takes place as the two sides battle back and forth across Germany and France, but there are other theaters where the two sides come into conflict. The Soviet player will need to deflect amphibious and aerial attacks against Vladivostok and Korea, while the Allied player will have to fight off a southern advance into the Middle East and Persia.  The two sides each have different strengths as well. The Soviets have a tremendous number of units, while the Allies have superior technology and production potential. With that in mind, it makes the most sense for the Soviet player to make a bold strike early and hope to hold back the Allied counterattack long enough to claim victory. Sadly, the AI is a bit timid here, so victory isn't too terribly difficult to achieve.   In terms of actual gameplay, the espionage elements are probably the most significant. Players can use their supply points to buy three types of espionage units -- spies, security forces and signals intelligence. Spies can be used against any power in the world (including those members of your alliance) and will be useful in exploring the fog of war and revealing hidden units, production orders and research priorities. The signals intelligence assets can also reveal units hidden by the fog of war but are more useful in granting potential combat modifiers to friendly forces. You defend against both spies and signals intelligence by investing in security forces.  The use of espionage is definitely a great addition to the game, especially for gamers who like to play under the fog of war restrictions. Getting concrete information about what your enemy is doing and where their forces are located is a huge advantage. The downside is that it really takes up a lot of your supply points to properly fund an espionage campaign. Whether you can make up the loss by better planning smarter attacks is one of the great balancing acts in the game.      Though the previous game included plenty of neutral and frozen countries, A World Divided offers a lot more in the way of diplomacy with non-combatant countries. Each neutral country has one of five stances to indicate their leaning towards the Allies or the Axis and a separate Volatility rating that influences how likely that stance is to shift towards full participation as a member of the Allied or Axis forces. Neutrals that are merely leaning to your side will give you resources every turn. Those neutrals that are strongly sympathetic will also give you supplies. This, of course, assumes that they are connected by rail or transport to the rest of your empire.  There are some simple rules for how you can change a countries stances towards the Axis or Allies. Invading countries that are leaning towards your enemy will influence their neighbors towards your side. Those that are leaning towards your enemy may adopt a more neutral stance. Those that are leaning your way may go all in and offer to become part of your group. On the other hand, invading countries that are leaning towards your own side will influence their neighbors away from you.   We'd love to have seen a little more sophistication here. As it is, diplomacy simply seems to be a consequence of your success in carrying out invasions. To our mind, that's almost exactly the opposite way it should work. Rather than letting players craft meaningful and unique relationships with other countries, the game simplifies so that all you can do to change a country's opinion of you is invade their neighbors.  While the espionage elements and diplomacy definitely factor into the overall East vs. West scenario, the new random events don't really play a part. Players will have to move to the larger World War II campaign to get a taste of those new elements.  The new random political events can occur at the beginning of each turn. While they're called ~random~ they tend to reinforce the general historical trend of the War. Choosing a later start date for the game automatically triggers most of these events for you. The early events include Italy joining the Axis, the USSR invading Finland, and border wars in Greece and Romania. The later events tend to mix things up a bit more, with coups forcing nations to switch allegiances between the Axis and Allies. Unfortunately, these later events have a very low chance of occurring and so don't really matter much in the long term.   While A World Divided includes the espionage and diplomacy elements that we missing from the original game, there's not so much new here that owners of the original game need to rush right out and grab the update. The diplomacy and spying options are nice but aren't quite flexible enough to give the player any real sense of control over the course of the game. The random political events merely reinforce the game's tendency to stick to the course of history.On the other hand, World at War provides a comprehensive yet comprehensible simulation of the ~big picture~ of World War II. Gamers who are looking for an introduction to high-level wargames should definitely consider giving this one a look.", "date": "Feb 22, 2007"}
