Well, if we had to do the vote all over again, not only would NCAA Football 2004 replace its predecessor on the list, it would probably get bumped up a few spots in prestige as well.  If you're a fan of college football, pro football, football where they kick the bloody ball and don't use their hands, hell, if you ever ordered a subscription to Sports Illustrated and received the football phone as a free gift, you will rejoice in the atmosphere, the excitement, and the sheer greatness that is NCAA Football 2004.  That being said, one of the main additions to the game is online play. And while that's reason alone to high step to the store and spike the cash register, the game's only online for the PlayStation 2, and what's worth singing about on one system is like a slap in the face to the other two, especially the Xbox, where sports games are all the rage and the online capabilities of Live continue to reign supreme. Unfortunately, Live must continue its reign without the support of EA, so if you're looking to rule with your school online, the PlayStation 2 version is your only choice.  The great thing about NCAA, though, is even without online play, the game is so much superior to most football titles on the market and is packed with so many features and gameplay modes, that you will still be busy recruiting players in your twentieth franchise season before you realize the real college football season has already ended. Who needs to know the national champ, anyway? I guarantee you'll be so wrapped up in your season and your created school, that people will ask what college you attend and you might shout out ~J-Rob U~ (or your equivalent, although feel free to make J-Rob U) just by sheer involvement. Sad as it is to say, I've spent way more time at J-Rob U then I ever did in class, but what can I say, at least I'm number one in the nation.  Head-to-Head Available! Don't know which version of NCAA Football 2004 is right for you? We tell you in this point-by-point breakdown with side-by-side screenshots and tons of info.

Links :: Video Review | Read It Now |      Another hot new feature is the Greatest Games mode. We've all played games where the score was like 49-48 with two seconds left and by some strange string of events, a few laterals, and maybe a stiff arm to the safety, you break free and score the winning touchdown. Whether you made the play or were the one left in disbelief as your friend busts out a cabbage patch in your living room, there's no denying you just played a great game. NCAA now tracks your 10 greatest games and actually ranks them in order of greatness. When you click on the game you can review everything from the box score to the player of the game. It's a small thing, but it's another feature that feels rewarding and reassuring that the game you just played will be remembered in your memory and the memory of your game system for years, or at least until next year's game. In addition, NCAA also keeps track of your career and school records, and even includes a trophy room for you display all of your player awards and conference championship trophies.  Gameplay  The biggest complaint I've had throughout the history of the NCAA Football series has been the erratic and occasionally just plain horrid play of the defensive backs. They'd be in the right position, but just couldn't make a play if their scholarships and all the cheerleaders they could handle were riding on it. Even if picking passes is too much to ask for, at least knock down the damn ball, I mean, we're playing in the Rose Bowl here, kid, make a play. Thankfully, this problem has finally been addressed, as corners and safeties not only play the ball more aggressively and intercept ill-advised passes, they'll even make plays on balls they can't pick and actually swipe at the pigskin and chop it down. Finally, a game where you feel you can make plays on defense and that every game is not going to be a shootout full of long bombs and busted coverage.    Another improvement comes in the way of blocking. Your players will work for you far down the field trying to open holes, even blindsiding defenders unaware of their dangerous surroundings. This takes place on special teams as well as your teammates wrestle non-stop, forming wedges and creating seams in order to clear a path back to paydirt. Once you reached the promised land, you can even choose to dunk the ball over the goalpost or jump into a Heisman pose utilizing one of eight Custom Celebrations you trigger by hitting the right buttons as you cross the goal line. You might get an unsportsmanlike penalty for mocking your opponent, but it's well worth the price of 15 yards and a yellow flag.  Other new enhancements that will help lead you to the house are the new camera angles involved in all playaction passes and draw plays. This will sucker in even the most seasoned football gamer, as the camera actually closes in on the running back during a playaction pass, then zooms back out into the passing window. But by that time, the linebackers and safeties might have already bitten, and the passing lanes have completely opened up. The opposite holds true for draws. The camera pulls back and the passing icons actually pop up like it's a pass play even though the quarterback just handed the ball to the running back on the delay. Masterful stuff that really brings the spirit of these fakes and deceptions into the reality of the game.  Speaking of deception, NCAA also boasts an outrageous number of new trick plays, from the double end around pass back to the quarterback to simpler wingback reverses, if there's a trick play you've always wanted to try in a videogame, chances are you'll find it in this one.  Beyond those major improvements, the gameplay is pretty much what you'd expect if you played any of the previous version in the series. There are plenty of other subtle upgrades, from new tackles to the way receivers actually turn their heads to look back for the ball, but if you're not a die-hard football fan, you probably won't appreciate just how cool that is.    Graphics  Authentic intros featuring players running out of tunnels add to the spirit of each contest, and the fact that they even added the Notre Dame team entrance where they pound the Play Like A Champion plaque shows the level of detail the designers were willing to capture.   On the field you'll see new tackle animations near the sidelines, players stumbling after a hit, and as the camera zooms in after a touchdown, you'll even see the raw emotion detailed on the player's faces as they let out a scream while flexing for the cameras. The camera angles, like I mentioned earlier in regard to the playaction pass, have also been utilized more to become an asset, not a liability of the gameplay. Beyond playaction and draws, when the quarterback rolls out of the pocket, the camera rolls out with him and pivots to the wide side of the field so you have a better look at the entire landscape, not just the sideline area you're running toward. One feature that was taken out at the last second, though, was the animation of the crowd storming the field and ripping down the goalposts. I guess the NCAA doesn't condone that type of behavior in real life, so EA doesn't condone it in the game, although it sure would've been cool to see.    When broken down side-by-side, the Xbox version is definitely the best looking of the three systems, as the game supports HDTV 480P and delivers the sharpest looking athletes, cheerleaders and mascots this side of The Fiesta Bowl. Beyond the Box, it's a mixed bag. The PS2 version is highlighted by a sharp, vibrant look, while the GameCube features a more saturated appearance.  Sound  One of the aspects the developers really focused on for 2004 was the sound. The way the crowd reacts, the fight songs, the grunts and groans on the field all lend an air of authenticity to a game when done right, and this year they set out to make some marked improvements. Not only do you hear cannons firing, you have the addition of new school fight songs, and you finally have a crowd that reacts to the plays on the field. If you're playing a game at home and throw a ten-yard slant, the crowd might cheer a little. But break a tackle and burst into the open field and you'll hear the cheers grow louder until they start going out of their minds as you cross the goal. There are also a number of situational chants, like the crowd urging you to go for it on fourth down that just capture everything you know and love about the game of football, whether you're a fan or a player. NCAA Football 2004 is a game so good, it has no competition. That's right, Sega backed off of this year's college football race, so if you're a fan of amateur athletics, this is the only game available this season. Not that that's a bad thing. In fact, even if there was a choice, there really wouldn't be a choice, NCAA Football 2004 is just that damn fun. From creating schools to recruiting players to fighting for your shot at number one, every aspect from the gameplay to the gridiron has been improved over its predecessor and once again takes the series to that next level. If you own multiple systems and are trying to choose the best version to buy, it really comes down to whether or not you plan to play online. If that's the case, buy the PS2 version. If not, the Xbox version looks a bit better but that's really the only thing that distinguishes it. The Cube game looks the worst of the three and the controller is a bit frustrating to tackle, so while the game is still fun on its own, if you own another system, leave your Cube for Link and hit the field on your PS2 or Xbox.", "date": "Jul 16, 2003"}
