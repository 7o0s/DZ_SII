He's just such a dedicated protagonist. I mean, most heroes would get to their third papery adventure, find out they've got to - once again - go traipsing across the land to find all the crystal/star/heart shards, and say 'enough's enough'. So what if the world is on the brink of destruction? Enough with the collecting already! Still, I can see why he wants to press on. I mean, the Paper Mario games may rely on that tried and tested 'unite the shards to defeat the big bad' structure, but that's about the only nod to the conventions you'd expect from a Nintendo title. In almost every other regard, the Paper Mario games are a riot of creative ideas, entertaining dialogue, fourth-wall breaches, innovative presentation and other surprises. And the best part is that with each instalment - and this one in particular, Intelligent Systems radically shifts up the gameplay, obviously revelling in the possibilities of the world.    As you'd probably know, it all started with Paper Mario on N64, which introduced Mario as a paper-thin protagonist. While it had many of the trappings of an RPG - levelling up, a party system and turn-based battles, it gave the humble RPG its own spin. 'Action Commands' in battle gave you timed ways to boost your attack or defence, hence making battles more interactive, while the use of 2D characters in a 3D world was used to create an enchanting pop-up book visual aesthetic. The second game in the series, Thousand-Year Door did away with the concept of Bowser as big bad (while continuing to explore his love for Peach), put the turn-based battles on a stage (so that eventually you were playing to a packed audience - that could both help and hinder you) and really worked the paper concept, allowing Mario to fold into a paper plane, boat, scroll and so on.    It's the third game in the series, however, that takes the biggest lateral step (literally), to the point that Super Paper Mario sits in its own hybrid genre; part RPG, part platformer. It's a gutsy move from Intelligent Systems, as fans (myself included) would have been quite happy with another sequel in the vein of the previous titles. Instead, we have an all-new beast. What's changed? For a start, the world is now primarily presented from side-on, like a 2D platformer. The hub world Flipside, for instance, is comprised of a host of streets on top of one another, with elevators connecting the various floors. It's still a town to explore, with shops and houses to visit, but with a 2D platform twist. The other huge change? Say goodbye to turn-based combat. Nooooo! Sadly, yes. It's back to real-time head-bopping for Mario. Elsewhere, the party system has changed (more on that in a bit), levelling up and items are less integral and the badge system is gone.     Why the sweeping changes? Because Mario has a serious ace up his sleeve - the ability to 'flip' the world. Hit the A button and the presentation flips sideways, to reveal that the 2D path you were on actually has depth. This simple idea reveals a whole world of potential for puzzles and secrets, and Intelligent Systems make great use of it. At a basic level, you may discover that a single line of coins from one perspective is actually a field of coins in the other, or that what seemed to be a plain row of overhead boxes is actually arrayed in a zig zag pattern in 3D. So far so simple, but that's only the beginning. You may need to flip the world to reveal stairs up what seemed to be a sheer wall in 2D, or to reveal access to a new area through what was - a second before - a flat backdrop. It doesn't often make logical sense, but that's one of the reasons it's so compelling, and it's always fascinating to see how the movement puzzles have been designed across both perspectives.    The use of two perspectives also pays homage to one of the reasons we all fell in love with the Super Mario Bros. platform games in the first place - secrets. There's just nothing like flipping the world to find an item hiding behind a pipe, or a cave with a treasure chest lurking in what you thought was a dead end. There's also a whole lot more to Flipside than first meets the eye, including an entire nah, I won't spoil it. You'll also discover enemies and NPCs lurking in the alternate perspective, as well as enemies that can flip between the two, and bad guys that are boxy polygonal models in either.   So that's the big hook for Super Paper Mario. Doubtless you knew all about it already (what with the game's long gestation period and the fact that it's been out overseas for aaaages now), but it's worth emphasising again just how cool the flip mechanic is. Every level has several interesting or surprising uses of the mechanic, and levels like the 'Whoa Zone' play with orientation even further, sending you through a maze of doors on the floor, walls and ceiling. Mind you, there's more to Super Paper Mario than just the flip mechanic. As the game progresses you gain three travelling companions who you can switch between at any time. Bowser, for instance, has twice the attacking power of Mario and unleashes a jet of flame when you hold down on the D-pad. Very handy.      Then there are the Pixls - floating, erm 'things', which essentially replace the party members and special abilities from the last game. Instead of Bobbery, for instance, you have Boomer (pictured in the screen above), whose explosive abilities can be used to take out enemies and blow holes in cracked sections of walls. And instead of earning Mario's ability to turn side on to slip through narrow gaps, you find Slim, a Pixl that gives you the same power. Other Pixls include Cudge (who gives Mario his trusty hammer attack), Carrie (who you ride like a hoverboard and can be used to get over spiked pits), and Thoreau (who you throw to grab enemies or items). You can only have one of these Pixls selected at a time, but it's easy enough to switch depending on the situation. As in previous games, these guys open up plenty of puzzle potential, and you keep unlocking new Pixls all the way through the game.    There's also one other Pixl that's with you the entire time (well, almost the entire time), and that's Tippi. By pointing at the screen, Tippi can give you information about enemies and other things in the environment, and can also reveal hidden objects. To be honest, Tippi's inclusion feels a little tacked on - an afterthought that was added when development shifted from GameCube to Wii. No matter, the mechanics overall - and the world design to exploit them - are fantastic.     Mind you, there are definitely some areas that are weaker than others. The zero-G space shooter levels for instance felt really aimless and charmless, while the bosses are almost all quite disappointing (although you have to love the 'Brobot'), which may be a reflection of the fact that the real-time battles simply aren't as interesting as the old turn-based ones were. The emphasis is definitely on the world rather than the combat this time around. We should also mention that while action commands have survived the transition, they've done so in name only - shaking the Wiimote when you head-bop an enemy doth not an action command make.    Other weak areas? Well, while you do level up (which is now entirely automated - you can't decide where to build up your stats), it's far less of a focus and isn't tied into the gameplay as well as it was in previous games. Items are also pretty pointless now; you'll mostly use them to recoup health or for cooking, and you can hardly carry more than a handful, which seems a bit arbitrary.     But back to the good stuff! As fans would expect, the storyline in Super Paper Mario won't win any awards, but it's certainly engaging, particularly the role that Bowser and Peach's wedding plays (no, I'm not spoiling anything), the idea of the Light Prognosticus and Dark Prognosticus and the fact that Intelligent Systems has - again - introduced a new bad guy (and a host of lieutenants), rather than just falling back on the usual suspects.    Like previous games, the translation is first rate, so while there's a lot of dialogue, for the most part it's gold, with just the right blend of slang, offbeat humour and references to both gaming and previous Paper Mario titles. We were entertained for the duration, even laughing out loud in a few spots (most notably during the section that mercilessly lampoons geeks and hardcore gamers through a series of true or false statements like ~I love going on message boards and complaining about games I've never played~).    The visual style of the game is masterful too at least, for the most part. The 2D art design is top notch, with each world housing its own very distinct visual style - each vivid, colourful and inventive, with some of the best texture design ever to grace a 2D game. That is, when there are textures. One of the most striking worlds has backgrounds built entirely from big, chunky pixels. Pixel mountains, pixel trees and a pixel sea (complete with air bubbles that are just single white pixels zig zagging up the screen). Gotta love it. You've also got to love the fact that this world houses a homage to World 1-2 from the original Super Mario Bros., complete with the warp pipes area. Now you can see this classic level from an all-new perspective.      We also love the fact that at the beginning of each world, the setting is drawn in - from a blank, white space, the major objects are drawn in line by line, until colour is finally added. It's an unnecessary, but thoroughly cool inclusion, and the same thing happens when Mario nabs a star, transforming him into a screen-filling version of the original Mario sprite. It's geek heaven watching that getting drawn into the world (see screen above).    Speaking of Mario, while he looks great, as do the other Ninty stalwarts, it's great to see just how whacked out the rest of the character design in the game is. From weird blobby aliens to boxy technicoloured freaks, Intelligent Systems has really gone wild and abstract with the NPCs and enemies. They're bizarre, but they definitely add colour to the game, and it's refreshing to see the team put its own stylistic stamp on the game, instead of trying to stay within the typical Nintendo style guide.    In contrast to the amazing art design in 2D, the 3D perspective is disappointing. No matter how striking the world in 2D, when you flip it invariably transforms into a bland, boxy path, lacking the colourful, interesting textures that give the normal perspective so much character. I think the team wanted to keep the perspective simple so as not to clutter the gameplay, but for us it's a missed opportunity. No matter - you spend the bulk of your time in the 2D perspective.   Complementing the presentation is another stellar soundtrack that very much picks up where Thousand-Year Door left off, moving between catchy but cheesy Mario-esque tunes and weirder electronica. Nice.Even if the Wii was inundated with great titles right now, Id still be telling you to go out and buy this game. Super Paper Mario is the ultimate combination of style and substance, and while many of the features lost from previous Paper Mario titles will be missed, its great to see Intelligent Systems continue to push the series. The new flip mechanic in particular is a stroke of genius, and when combined with multiple characters and the Pixl party system, has resulted in some really compelling level design.
