{"name": "Silver", "name_review": "Silver", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/07/06/silver", "text": "It's ironic that the best Japanese-style RPG on Dreamcast comes our way through a non-Japanese developer and publisher.  Infogrames and Spiral House's recently released action RPG Silver is that very game.  Better than the horribly cute and loveable Evolution and its horribly boring sequel, and far more solid a game than Sega and Climax's Time Stalkers, Silver has more than enough to hold us over until the epic RPGs arrive later this year.   You play the role of David, a young knight living peacefully in the land of Jarrah.  Jarrah is composed of a set of islands, many linked by bridges (so you can easily walk from one island to the next, with rare exception).  A corrupt sorcerer called Silver rules over the land, and one day, out of nowhere, decides to abduct all the village women, including David's chickedy, Jennifer (what's with the damn generic names!?).  True to heroic form, David heads off on a journey to find his love and defeat silver, no matter what the cost (you got the touch!)  Without spoiling the story, I can probably mention that your adventures will lead you all across Jarrah, from frozen icelands to the land of the almost dead (which is sorta like a purgatory ... well, maybe not).  You'll meet numerous characters, shop for items, uncover new paths, fight through numerous action-based battle sequences, and will eventually find that killing your foe requires that you collect eight-or-so ancient orbs that were scattered long ago across the world.  Yes, the eight scattered orb thing has been done to death, but Silver manages to take a different approach.  You don't uncover the eight orbs by searching through dungeon after dungeon after dungeon.  The orbs are earned through a variety of means, with some characters actually handing you an orb by your just speaking to them.  Other orbs do require lengthy searches, although you're not just going through floor after floor after floor in an endless dungeon.  Nope, you're in castles, trekking through frozen wastelands and strolling through the forest.  There's certainly great variety in your travels, and when combined with the few side quests strewn about (some optional, most required), your eighteen hour quest ends up being more fulfilling than just the orb searching would suggest.  You get the feeling that you accomplished something when playing through Silver.  That said, the game's story and story telling could've used a couple of extra drafts.  The story itself isn't deep enough to evoke serious thought, which is somewhat strange, as the lengthy CG intro suggests that it may do just that.  This isn't an epic adventure, not by a long shot.  The storytelling is also quite weak, as the game lacks the cinematics found in more recent RPGs - an unfortunate thing, considering that the awesome background music could've made for many a dramatic situation.  The story sequences, at least early on, give us the minimal amount of direction in terms of story flow, and you may find yourself stuck numerous times without any clue of what to do next, leaving you searching randomly for the next major event (our Silver Guide should help considerably).  It's also difficult to care for the characters, as despite being voiced through some of the more memorable and humorous voice sequences out there, they come off as single tracked, with only subtle hints of a history and a life outside the game.  And when you encounter and defeat a main villain in the game, he passes on with minimal fanfare.  It's a somewhat disappointing exit.  Differences in depth of story and character aside, the general look of Silver will remind us of Square's landmark Final Fantasy VII.  For anyone who's grown tired of the whole polygon characters atop pre-rendered backdrop thing, which is also featured in Resident Evil and the upcoming Dino Crisis 2, you'll find out through Silver that there's a whole lotta potential left.  Silver's backgrounds are high resolution, and while still featuring dithering artifacts in some areas, are full of color.  It's somewhat hard to find exits and passages in the backgrounds (the help provided by the game is buggy at best - cough *Rushed PC Port* cough), but you'll get used to it after a while.  The polygon characters laid atop benefit from running in high res, and being free of the trademark PlayStation ugliness (sorry, but it's true), and you'll be amazed when seeing their numbers on screen, which often runs into the twenties and thirties.  Sure, the characters are as blocky as PlayStation models, but that ends up giving the game a cartoony look all its own, and the effect when combined with the distinctive, smooth animation is impressive to say the least.  The game doesn't push the Dreamcast by any means, and although it suffers from slowdown when too many characters appear on screen (cough *Rushed PC Port* cough), I still found myself marveling at the spectacle more often than not, even despite the lack of full motion video sequences like those of Final Fantasy VII.  This game is not meant to be a clone of Final Fantasy in any way, despite the similar look.  Silver is a unique experience due to its battle system, a strange hybrid of action and command-based tactics.  The PC version made heavy use of the mouse, asking that you command your character and party members to attack the hoards of enemies on screen (and there occasionally are swarms).  For the Dreamcast version, the developers have gone with a direct control system, with your moving only one character at a time around and slashing beasts Gauntlet-style.  You can select which of your three current party members you'd like to take command of, and the actions of the other members are left to a combination of the CPU AI, and various commands that you input.  I'm not sure how well the group battle system worked in the PC version, but it doesn't work at all in the Dreamcast version.  Actually commanding your members to take various actions is too difficult due to problems with the very PC-ish interface (cough *Rushed PC Port* cough).  When combined with the horrid CPU AI, you'll find yourself letting your allies die, rather than attempting to keep them by your side (I was well prepared for the couple of times when the main hero is forced to fight solo).  Thankfully, battling by yourself ends up being rather enjoyable.  Control over your character is good, and although the game's combo system is difficult to get used to, you'll probably have enough fun just hacking and slashing away using the main attack button.  Blocking also comes into play in major fashion here, as does spell casting, and I personally enjoyed looking for all the various spells and shield items in the game.  The only thing that gets in the way of this single player fighting aspect is that your character is often way too small to see what's going on.  However, you won't find this killing you, as there are plenty of healing items strewn about the dungeons, waiting to be picked up.   So what we have with Silver is an enjoyable action RPG that, with a bit more time (cough *Rushed PC Port* cough), could've been a whole lot better.  As it is, I had a good time with the game and looked forward to seeing what was set to happen next.  This is a definite recommendation for RPG fans.  -- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDC", "date": "Jul 6, 2000"}
