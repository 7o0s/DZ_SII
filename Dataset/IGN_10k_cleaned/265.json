Horse racing is one of them. Which only partly explains the phenomenal popularity of the sport over there. Another reason would be that it presents lazy husbands with an opportunity to escape from their family responsibilities and run off down the track to guzzle beer with their pals. But that's another story. Cue Gallop Racer.  Gameplay  Differing substantially from its main rivals in Japan, Winning Post and Derby Stallion, Gallop Racer successfully combines complex simulation elements with fast-paced arcade action sequences to present a total package for the horse racing fan. Rather than wade through page after page of boring statistics only to find that all you can do is sit back and watch your horse at race time, Gallop racer puts you in the actual  driving seat. Or saddle. Once you've considered all the variables (and  boy, there are a lot of variables!) you get to take control of your  horse and guide him or her around the track and on to victory -  hopefully. I say hopefully, because before you get the chance to do  that, you're going to have to do some serious studying.   Gallop Racer presents you with a very arcade-oriented two-player option that basically enables  players to jump right into the action phase of the game. Here, once  you've scanned the listings and chosen your respective steeds, it's  instantly off to the races where it's a straightforward sprint to the  finish line. Tactics do come into play, as they do in the more meaty  career game, but much less so: all you really have to worry about is  pacing your horse so it doesn't get winded and fade too quickly on the  home straight. All the tracks are the real US deal -- and as you will see  later in this review, this could turn out to be quite a bonus for fans  of the sport!   For the more substantial horse racing experience, though, gamers will  need to take a couple of deep breaths and plunge headlong into the  career mode. It's confusing when you first start, because there doesn't  seem to be any obvious way of actually starting the game, so be warned  that the very first thing you must do is buy a horse or two for your  stables. There are two listings of available animals, divided simply into  males and females. It's worth taking a bit of time here, because your  choices affect the whole of the rest of the game in every respect: you  must look at each horse in turn and weigh its relative merits -- and the  best ones are not always the most expensive, so be careful.  Racing Styles This is where you're going to need some notebooks, or at least a pen and some  paper. Horses are rated on a huge number of characteristics, the two  most important probably being staying power (stamina) and sprint  ability. But they also each have one of four racing styles (this becomes  important later on), prefer certain track conditions (wet, firm, etc)  and peak at different ages, so you have to take note of how old they are  when you buy them and how long they have left before they're on the way  down again. Past form (how well they did at previous race meets) is also  crucial, so make a note of that too.   Next up are the selection screens  for the actual race. Each horse is best over certain distances - like  athletics, a 100m sprinter won't fare so well over a 10,000m race -- and  that two year old stallion that likes running under eight furlongs will run  out of juice way before the finishing post if you enter him in a 12  furlong event. All these choices slowly build up your understanding and  knowledge so that by the time you're ready to race, you're likely to  have a far better chance of placing in the top three.   With all that decision-making over, the action is about to start. Once  your horse is in the stalls, all the information you've absorbed comes  into play. You have a certain amount of control over your ride - you can  guide the horse left or right, urge him on with a touch of the crop  (whip), and give him his head for an outright sprint to the finish. All  the while, you have to remember your tactics, and play the field to your  advantage. Some horses like to run from the back of the pack and make a  final sprint near the line; some like to lead from the front for the  entire race; others like to stay in the pack until you urge them to go  for it. Understanding and using these tactics is essential for victory --  ignore them and you'll get used to seeing your beloved thoroughbreds  wheeze, stumble and expire horribly with three furlongs to go while the rest  of the pack thunders past you.   Points and money are awarded for each placing, which you can then use to  buy stablemates for your existing collection. As you get deeper into the  game, new horses become available, some of them very, very good runners  indeed, so it's well worth persevering to see them. There's even an  option to breed the things: or, as Tecmo more delicately put it, to  'create original horses.' Don't get too excited -- you don't see them  actually mate or anything, but the high-tech graphical representation of  the new foal being created is charming in its own way! It also ensures  that all your hard work in making champions out of your stock is  rewarded with even more genetically-gifted steeds. That's pretty cool if  you ask me.  Graphics  As a horse racing simulation, state-of-the-art graphics are not really  expected. However, what there is (mostly in the arcade portion of the  game) is very good indeed, with horses modeled in full 3D with  exceptionally-realistic movement. There are varying weather effects  throughout the game, and this in turn affects your horses' performance  (much like changing weather can screw up your tire strategy in an F1  racing game). Textures are simple, but there's no polygon clipping to  speak of, the stadia are all very well modeled, and the horses always  look as if they're belting around the tracks in solid contact with the  ground. There are plenty of horses on the courses at any one time and no  glaring glitches -- but like I said, this is not the most graphically  ambitious game in the first place. As it is, everything looks just fine.  Sound  Possibly the worst aspect of the whole game, the sound is either extremely basic (in terms of the thudding of horses' hooves on turf and simple stadium announcements) or really very nasty indeed. There's this horrible kind of plinkety-plonk easy-listening music at the selection screens that tends to loop very quickly. Not the best, but not a big deal either.An excellent blend of arcade action and deep, involving sim that practically guarantees you'll have more luck placing bets next time you visit the race track!", "date": "Sep 30, 1999"}
