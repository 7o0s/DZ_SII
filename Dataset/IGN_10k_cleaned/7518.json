Which is precisely why we thought we'd get it out of the way right at the beginning. There you go: Pilot Academy - it's a bit like Pilotwings.   But, to be honest, it really isn't at all. You see, while the irreverent objectives, cheerful graphics and lilting musical ambiance are undoubtedly reminiscent of Nintendo's classic series, Pilot Academy is far more of a sim than Pilotwings ever was - and that's something you'll need to understand right from the off if you're going to avoid spending your first couple of hours with the game cursing a furious pox on its designers, their spouses, children and that woman who pops around every Thursday to dust off the gladiolas.    Initially, you'll want to steer your plane with the kind of simplistic arcade turn-on-a-dime control you'd generally expect from a game of this nature. It quickly becomes apparent that's not how the developer wants you to play at all, though. Instead, you'll need to take manual control of banking, pitch and yaw, rudder, take off, cruise and landing gears, your air brakes, undercarriage and, in later missions, weapons.   Gameplay is split into three distinct sections - lessons, missions and challenges - with each further divided into leisure or military pursuits. It's worth mentioning the tutorial missions here, which range from getting yourself airborne to filling an enemy aircraft with lead. When there's so much to get to grips with in a game we applaud a well-implemented compulsory tutorial. Thing is, Pilot Academy just doesn't do a very good job of introducing even the most basic of techniques you'll need to see you through to the end.    Case in point: the very first leisure mission attempts to teach you the ins and outs of taking off. Unfortunately, while the plum-voiced instructor does an excellent job of making it sound like she wants to get into your pants, she's less clear about how you're actually supposed to achieve your goal. It's all well and good demanding you adjust your flaps, squeeze your throttle and push up your rear but you've got a problem when the only way to figure out control specifics is by cross-referencing terminology in the manual and working buttons out from there. This is, after all, supposed to be a pick-up-and-play portable title.   Even worse, your first commercial airline jaunt demands you fly along a pre-determined route, keeping the journey - and the passengers inside - as comfortable as possible. If your passengers start to get twitchy, your comfort gauge takes a tumble and the mission is automatically failed. Trouble is, it just isn't made very clear what exactly irks the passengers and we found ourselves failing at seemingly random intervals again and again. In fact it took multiple phone calls to our friendly PR representative, and literally hours of agonising tedium, before we pinned the problem down to not having raised our wheels after take off. It doesn't help that the game completely neglects to mention you've got manual control of your wheels before the mission. The fact that the manual fails to point out that both your gears and undercarriage are operated via 'select', with it being necessary to hold the button down for several seconds to raise and lower your wheels is, frankly, just inexcusable.     Certainly, we can't help feel that developer Kuju has been overly ambitious with Pilot Academy. While the kind of control complexity required in a flight sim might be fine on a PC where keys are hardly in short supply, the PSP simply isn't equipped to deal with all the individual elements at your disposal here, with many buttons doubling up for multiple commands. We're also not entirely convinced that the PSP's innately twitchy analogue nub is up to the precision demands of the game either, making steering far more of an ordeal than it really should be.   Despite all this though, perseverance does pay off and, once you've exhausted all the expletives in your vocabulary, things do start to make sense. You'll suddenly be able to navigate through the skies without sending your plane spiralling into some irreversible death plummet after a misjudged button press and, for a while, Pilot Academy proffers up a strangely endearing plate of fun. There's simply a ton to do - from jettisoning a business woman to her next meeting, pausing to examine her triplet of oil refineries sprawled across the desert below, navigating a commercial airline through a hurricane or photographing a herd of endangered animals at a safari park.    When the game gets it right, it's an entirely engaging experience, with missions hitting home, whether offering a serene ride through the skies or a tense nail-biting fight against nature or other mechanical foes. Military missions - taking place across three continents and four unique time periods (World War I, II, modern day and a combination of all three) - sling mid-air chases, combat and dogfights into the mix, and these are frequently entertaining when you've got to grips with the controls.   All too often though, once you've settled into the game's groove, it suddenly feels the need to completely undermine your progress with another ill-explained addition to the control set-up and it's like being sent right back to square one. Eventually too, missions can start to feel repetitive. Ultimately, all you're ever doing is taking off, flying from A to B and landing again, over and over. Admittedly, there's only so much pep you can put into a flight sim, but the repetitiveness is compounded by the entirely functional, flat and bland environments. Limiting any sense of speed, scale or wonder, actually flying from one objective to another can become a tedious affair after extended play - which isn't good for a game based around flight.    Controls also mar what would otherwise be an enjoyable, fully-featured multiplayer mode, offering dogfights, air wars and chases for up to four players. Despite a large selection of environments and unlockable planes to go head-to-head in, the control mastery required to play proficiently means it's questionable whether you'll ever muster a sufficient number of friends skilled enough at the game to make a session practical.Ultimately, Pilot Academy isn't a bad game per se - it's competent, charmingly presented and feature-packed. There's absolutely no denying that there's fun to be had with the title either - it's just going to take a particularly dedicated gamer to overcome the numerous obstacles blocking the route to the game's heart. If you're a PSP-owning flight sim fanatic, it's entirely possible you'll love the meaty selection of planes, locations and missions Kuju has managed to squeeze into its portable package. For everyone else though, the ultimately repetitive game structure and constant brick-wall learning curve makes Pilot Academy a tough game to love, no matter how much you might want to.", "date": "Nov 6, 2006"}
