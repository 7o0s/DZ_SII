Then again, when you take into consideration the fact that you can complete the entire Story mode in less time than it takes to watch the movie the game is based on, you feel like Edward Norton isn't the only one getting ripped off.  Okay, so ripped off might be a bit harsh. Like I said, the game has its moments and definitely delivers a fast and fun experience...while it lasts. But with no Live, limited two-player races, and an entirely too short Story mode, you can get everything out of this racer with a rental, and that's something even Marky Mark's Funky Bunch would have a hard time arguing with, good vibrations and all.  Gameplay Based on the summer popcorn flick, that is actually based on the 1969 crime classic of the same name, The Italian Job is a racing game that can best be described as Midtown Madness 3 without the Live. You're given an objective and a general direction, but you have free roam of the city to get there. This enables you to find shortcuts to cut time, ramps to score big air bonus points, and, of course, race like a madman through oncoming traffic as you try to shave a few seconds by speeding the wrong way down a freeway off ramp. How does all this interact with the movie? Well, you're given objectives like follow a mark or steal a cable van, and basically you need to drive from point A to point B within the given amount of time in order to ultimately steal back the stolen gold that was originally stolen from you, get it? And when you're given your objective, there's usually a still shot from the blockbuster, but that's about it beyond the initial movie footage you're teased with in the intro. So while you might see a pic of Seth Green, don't expect to hear him yell his trademark ~I got the Holy Spirit!~ or ~I'm the real Napster~ when you accomplish a goal. The game is more about acting in the spirit of the movie and driving crazy than being another component of the film like the recently released Enter the Matrix. It's not like you're going to unveil any secrets about Mos Def you didn't already know by purchasing the game, but if you enjoyed the movie, you'll enjoy driving in its spirit as well.

Get The Guide | Italian Job Message Boards  While burning rubber around the city of Los Angeles, you get a great sense of speed as the frame rate is a solid 60 fps, and it really is cool to dart through traffic on the way to accomplish your goals, especially when those damn cops are trying to ram you from behind and arrest you. One of the main problems with the game, though, is the fact that all of the missions and objectives within Story mode are so short. Most of the objectives take place around the same portion of the city as well, so once you learn the best path throughout certain stretches of road, you can actually beat some of the objectives in under 30 seconds. Another frustrating aspect of the objectives is the fact that if you fail one of the goals, you don't restart from that objective, but from the beginning of the entire level. And while the objectives are short, it's not something I'd call fun to have to go back to a part of the game you already defeated. After a while, you look for fun new ways to accomplish the same goal, like driving the entire level in reverse. And while that's good for an added laugh, it's not really the way the game is intended to be played. Another downer is the fact that you can drive through some cones and fences, but other barriers that look flimsy enough to crash through actually bring your car to a complete halt and it really kills all of your momentum in the level.    Beyond Story mode you can drive in standard Circuit races against the computer or a friend via split screen, beat the clock in Time Trial, or take on Stunt mode where you need to jump across ramps and drive along narrow straights in order to continue to the next obstacle course. Stunt mode is definitely the most fun of the extra modes, and it actually helps you get a handle of what you can and can't do while driving in the city. The game also offers you the ability to ride around L.A. at your own leisure in Free Roam. This is a great way to learn the streets and practice hitting turns at high rates of speed. Unfortunately, there just isn't enough traffic to satisfy the hit and run thrills I was after when cruising the barren streets of the City of Angels.  Speaking of hit and run, throughout the game as you crash into other cars, barriers, and buildings, your car will begin to smoke. While it doesn't seem to affect the way your vehicle handles, it will affect your overall grade on the level by deducting damage points. This comes into play for those looking to unlock new cars as you'll need an A grade to get the goods. By completing Story mode, you'll also be able to unlock a variety of film stills, concept art, and even the movie credits.     Graphics When you charge full speed into an oncoming bus, you'd expect a MINI to get trashed. And while smoke rises from the hood and you initially see some generic parts fly from your car, when you drive away and take a closer look, your MINI looks like you just drove it off the lot. Beyond the damage, the in-game graphics appear vibrant, polished, and overall pretty well done. Cruise around in the Union Jack and as the sun beats down on your hood and you check out the trees swaying in the wind, you'll want to run right out and throw down the 20-G's to make it happen in real life.  The cut scenes through Story mode look like they were thrown together at the last second, however, as they are sometimes nothing more than flyover footage of a building while you listen to the voiceover (that sounds nothing like the former underwear model, I should add). Considering this is a game cinematic based on a feature film, it's extremely disappointing, especially since the first cut scene you're given is perfectly interwoven with both footage from the game and the movie. The game developers had an awesome opportunity to incorporate more of this actual film footage to guide you through the caper, but for whatever reason (most likely time), decided to go with the shorter, cheaper scenes of buildings I already described.     Sound  Laid back grooves and screeching tires fill the air as you speed from street to street in hopes of stealing back your stolen riches, but the fact that the game doesn't support custom soundtracks is just another reason why you might want to drive yourself off a cliff, or at least turn down the volume in favor of some 50 Cent you already have bumpin' in your basement. It's not that the soundtrack they offer is that bad, it's just that these days, custom soundtracks have spoiled gamers, especially when it comes to driving games, and not even having the option is a serious letdown.When you take a turn at top speed and get your MINI on two tires as you slide between oncoming traffic, you really do feel the rush of excitement. But with so many better, deeper racers coming out in the last couple of months like Midtown Madness 3 and Midnight Club II it's still tough to recommend The Italian Job as anything more than a rental.Even though the game's release failed to coincide with the film's debut, the project still feels rushed as corners like additional movie footage and added depth to Story mode seemed to be cut in order to get the game out on store shelves before the movie left theaters altogether.If you pay anything more than the three dollar rental fee for this one, you're just one more victim of the heist.", "date": "Jun 24, 2003"}
