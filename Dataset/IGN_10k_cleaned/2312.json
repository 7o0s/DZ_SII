Angel Studios' TransWorld Surf shows that the difficult sport of surfing can indeed be done right, and done well, and this gamer couldn't be happier about it. TransWorld Surf is the first intelligent, hardcore, devilishly addictive -- and best -- surfing game on the planet, to date.    The First Well Designed Surfing Game Ever since Street Skater, the first skateboarding game, made its way to the PlayStation back in 1999, I've been thinking about how much fun a surfing game would be. I used to surf when I had more time and lived down in Southern California (where the water was warmer), and my life was simpler and easier. So, my longing for a surfing game has evolved into dreaming about it, and bugging studios to let me help them make the game. (Naturally, I've been denied at every step. Sob...)   But as many developers have been, I too have been puzzled as to how a surfing game should look and function. After all, creating a surfing is not as easy as it sounds. There are no stable, concrete objects to grind off, no buildings to jump to, no real lines to manual to, and hardest of all, there is the all-encompassing trouble of creating the perfect wave, which should move properly, look realistic, and provide that ideal surface on which to surf like a goofy videogame maniac. For all of the hard work that the clever guys from Neversoft have done in creating the greatest skateboarding game ever, three times in a row, it could be said that surfing may be an even harder game to make right.   That's where Angel Studios comes into play. With TransWorld Surf, the most difficult aspect to nail down was to create a set of waves that behave as a stable surface to gyrate wildly on with a surfboard, while also behaving somewhat like real waves, meaning that they demonstrate erratic behavior, dangerous barrels, and various levels of evolution, from a slowly rolling mound to the cresting, peaking mountain of water that represents what some might call nature in its greatest design. In this vein, Angel has crafted truly gorgeous waves that indulge players in ideal surfing conditions.   These waves are long, perfect lines that demonstrate the best waves ever; they're pristine, constant, and in my best surf-talk, they're like, God-like. Primo. Burly. Whatever. You know what I mean. They form incredible barrels that change in shape, section off, and that close out all together. They range in size and shape depending on the break, and the water itself changes in texture, from glassy to the more frayed, due to changing wind conditions. But the essence of each wave is truly marvelous. The barrels are full of ~spit,~ the waves section off with various peaks, there are lefts and rights, and there is plenty of room to play, pull off tricks, and goof around.   TransWorld Surf creates a huge watery landscape like no other surfing game has ever done. The game is designed with several real world beaches and breaks (nine in total), all of which deliver a handful of wave kinds. Unlike games in the past, there isn't just one wall of water, or one single wave to surf on, there are a constant set of perfect waves rolling in at all times, from outside peaks to inside breakers, some with huge, dangerous, close-out barrels, to perfect, long-rolling, seemingly never-ending barrels to waves that are small, fast, and lots of fun to rip part. And you can choose which ones you like.   Yes. What's just so luxurious about the game is that players get to see from a bird's eye view just what kinds of waves there are, and which ones they want to pick at any time. Once players are in the surf, they can call on the crazy Reef Girl, who buzzes by on a Jetski and delivers the surfer to the exact wave they would like to thrash.   Angel Studios also has created order where there was none before. The waves themselves are split into categories, Difficult, Hazardous, and Normal, each with a slightly different behavior, and each with a specific function, and this is not what you'd find in the real world. For instance, Difficult Waves are ones that in order to complete satisfactorily must be surfed from beginning to end for the full ~goal~ to be achieved. Hazardous Waves provide arcade-style objects to hit, run over, or things to jump on or over to attain the specific goal, and Normal Waves have a more basic function.   Gameplay When it comes down to the nitty-gritty, TransWorld Surf takes the basic premise of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and applies that paradigm to surfing. The game is essentially an great excuse to pull off tricks, combos and shred some of the most gorgeous waves ever seen in a videogame, and in most cases this works out just fine.   Gamers can select from Single Session, Pro Tour, Free Surf, or Multiplayer (up to four can vie here), all of which are self-explanatory. Pro Tour is the meat and potatoes of the game, from which players open up new breaks, videos, and codes. Select from a group of 13 surfers, four boards, and then get moving.   The up-to-date and initial list of surfers includes real pros (mostly men and at least one woman) from the likes of Tim Curran, Cory Lopez, Chris Ward, Dan Malloy, Taylor Knox, Fred Patacchia, Taj Burrow, Andy Irons, Rochelle Ballard, Shane Dorian, Shawn ~Barney~ Barron, Jason ~Ratboy~ Collins, and Christian Fletcher. No Kelly Slater, of course, because he's the star of Activision's upcoming surfing game.   The locations add a lot of variety, visually, but they also add depth. In each, the waves start off small, but they grow to huge sizes and powerful in strength, especially when you've opened up the later levels. Think Pipeline, Teahupoo, and Witches Rock. The whole list of locations includes Kirra Point (Australia), Hossegor (France), Tavarua (Fiji), Fort Point (California), G Land (East Java, Indonesia), Huntington Beach (Southern California), Witches Rock (Costa Rica), Pipeline (Hawaii), and Teahupoo (Tahiti). My only qualm is this -- Where the hell is Mavericks, or for that matter, the Wedge, The Ranch, or even Malibu, Steamers, or Rincon?  Getting to grips with the basics is easy, and the controls follow the Tony Hawk setup, for the most part. The A button is used to jump, B is to pull off laybacks/off the lips, Y is to grind (called a floater), and X is to slow down. The trigger buttons are used for air tricks. Players are encouraged to catch as many waves as possible in a limited time period, pull off a wicked assortment of moves, connecting them into combos, and best of all, get barreled. It's in the barrel that TransWorld Surf genuinely stands out above its brethren and truly innovates in the genre.   Unlike Sunny Garcia Surfing, in which the camera faces the surfer, and getting good barrel time is difficult and annoying, TransWorld Surf offers a brilliant roving camera that is the equivalent to a third-person perspective angle, which enables players to see what's ahead of them and therefore what to expect. But it's in the barrels that players are treated so well. Once players slow down and sit inside the barrel, the camera quickly and automatically moves under the lip of the wave and into the deepest part of the tube, and then picks the perfect place to watch as the waves curl over your head. Likewise, the camera automatically repositions itself outside the tube when players burst out of the barrel itself.   The barrels also are equivalent to the manuals in Tony Hawk, and it's in them that players seriously rack up massive points. As part of the goals in each level, players are told to attain loads of points, and the Normal Waves are best or this reason. Pull off as many moves as you like in a combo and then quickly settle down in the barrel and watch your combo meter cycle like mad. To put a point on it, Angel Studios' waves aren't always perfect, they section off down the line, so players have to speed up or get crushed in the barrel. In Dangerous Waves this happens often, and in Normal Waves it occurs enough to make you work to stay in the tube.   Riding the tube in is truly unprecedented; the experience is just awesome. The barrels can grow to huge sizes, or restrict down into five-year-old boy size, and it's your job to stay the course. Another smart feature that the player automatically performs a crouch, which he exercises appropriately to the size of the wave.   Getting back to the tricks, however, I found that the system isn't quite up to the level that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 was the first time out. Perhaps this has something to do with the nature of surfing, but I feel that it's more to do with the controls themselves. They're not that precise, nor are they perfectly responsive. And what this translates to is a lot of frustration with ollies and airs.   Getting enough air to pull off major air tricks is definitely hard. For instance, just pulling off one major air trick is pretty good, but two or three? Hmmmm... The controls definitely need to be more instantaneous, and moves have to be A) either easier to pull off in air, or B) quicker to pull off in air, or C) quicker, easier, and more varied. The result is that I'd much rather just pull off a few easier tricks and just resort to sitting in the barrel. While that's genuinely fun, aerial tricks should be just as fun.   Also, while it's not very well explained, not all tricks can be pulled off near the curl, or pit, of the wave -- the part where the lip is just curving over into the air. This is a major area for surf tricks and spontaneity, and instead, it's an area that results in bails. Additionally, pulling off fakies is hazardous unless you quickly press B to regain control. It says to do so in the manual, but it seems more natural to just be able to land backward and turn back out of it. Overall, the trick system is good, but it could be a lot better.   Lastly, TransWorld Surf did something that I complained about, and hopefully other journalists did as well, in Championship Surfing (and Sunny Garcia Surfing), which is that it added all sorts of objects to avoid. I guess that Angel felt that avoiding sharks would be fun, and that hitting jellyfish would be fun, or freeing dolphins, or hitting seagulls in mid-air (REALLY!), but to me, it's just silly nonsense, trivial and totally unrelated to the core of the game. Jumping was hard and annoying enough, but jumping boats, peaks, and barriers? Stupid and difficult = pissed off gamer.   And one last thing, I played at least 15 hours of this game, and through all the modes, and the Career mode is LONG and can be HARD in many areas. You'll be playing this game for at least 20 hours -- at least.   Graphics What's amazing about TransWorld Surf is that instead of just looking at waves and water, the game boasts at least nine major locales from all over the world that offer beautiful waves, large, elegantly detailed backgrounds, and some exceptionally slick menus, videos, and cutscenes.   The waves are the core of the game, visually, and they are the best I have seen to date. They're not without problems, but for the most part, they deliver a realistic and satisfying experience. The water textures are relatively average when the water is still, but the when it's moving the waves show off great water physics and properties. In the barrel, the whitewash streaks in every direction, the waves feature froth, spit off the lip of the wave, smooth glassy textures, and underwater, there are reefs, and dozens of objects to see (you know, when you've bailed).   The animals, including the sharks, dolphins, sea turtles, seagulls and jellyfish, well...let's just say that this is an arcade game, and leave it at that, OK? And of course, the backgrounds, the cities, especially the re-creation of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, Fort Point, and the Marina (even Alcatraz), look surprisingly accurate. Every location in the game looks different from the other, and features specifics that make it unique. The game won't win any major awards for best graphics ever, but they are good, and the overall production of the game -- cutscenes, movies, extras, menu style, etc., super-fast load times -- really put this game in high standing, visually.    Sound With a game such as TransWorld Surf, the standard thinking follows that alternative, power-pop and a litany of bands influenced by punk, straight rock, and other musical strains are what crazy surfing cowboys are into. There's no argument with that, and honestly, I grew to like many of the songs that I initially disliked. (Repetition always works.) The soundtrack includes Kut U Up, The Plug Uglies, The Stitches, Pepper, the Line, Hopelifter, Missing 23rd, Sloe, Stranded, and several others.   As for the sound effects, they are another story. The grunts and groans from these surfers are thankfully minimal, but they're basically stock items that could easily have been better by simply adding more variety. And in the sound effects department, there isn't much to hear, to be honest. I like the silly Reef Girl's voice, but that's because I'm a self-indulgent guy who wishes chicks would say those sweet and dirty things to me! The waves themselves make their own sounds, especially in the barrels, but the game is pretty much made up of music and grunts. Oh, and some dolphins, seagulls, and a few shark attack signals. In my humble opinion, the reason to buy an Xbox is TransWorld Surf...and, OK, Halo. Despite the minor qualms I have with Angel's surfing gem, I have truly been waiting and waiting for this game to hit retail and the overall game did not disappoint. Just like I've been waiting for Metal Gear Solid 2, Grand Theft Auto III, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, I have been jonesing for TransWorld Surf. It's totally original, innovative, and addictive, and there's nothing else like it, period. My recommendation is that if you like action games, extreme sports games, and games such as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series and Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2, then you're going to absolutely love TransWorld Surf. It's the best of its kind, and the series, which will continue, is only going to get better. Buy it, rent it, play it, do whatever you want, but whatever you do, give this a try, it's incredibly fun.", "date": "Nov 22, 2001"}
