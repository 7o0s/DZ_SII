If the answer is Daffy, then please read no further. But if Disney has you tight by your swollen little pinkies (much like it does the majority of the free world), then Ubi Soft and Disney Interactive are hoping that you'll give its latest N64 cart a look.  After having spent much time with Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers, the painful reality becomes obvious that this title is indeed going to bore many older gamers rather quickly. Gameplay is centered on the simple 2D side-scrolling games of generations past, but sadly only those brand new to such titles will find this one interesting at all. While there are definitely a few bright points to the title, we recommend that those even remotely curious in the game keep reading before deciding to slide this one under the tree for the holidays.  The Facts  For one player only Players bring Donald Duck to life in 24 levels spread across four different worlds 3D characters, enemies, and objects  2D side-scrolling action gameplay with limited 3D elements Four extra costumes for Donald to unlock and wear during gameplay Features many of Disney's duck characters like Daisy, Huey, Louie, and Dewey Multiple language support including French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and English. Save game data via built-in EEPROM memory in three possible slots High resolution mode available with use of the Expansion Pak  Gameplay Back before the days of the N64, games were much simpler in both design and play. The realm of 3D was relatively difficult to produce for most software, so instead the majority of titles for systems such as the SNES fell into the overpopulated 2D action-platform category. And because of this tight competition among developers for your platforming bucks, the games were good. Damn good. Some had even taken the genre to entire new levels of gameplay thrills, perfecting their formulas year after year.  So when a title like Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers comes wandering in from the dark in the year 2000 and attempting to classify itself among these greats (on a more advanced gaming system nonetheless), it certainly has much to live up to. Unfortunately for this latest title, 2D action fans are going to be very disappointed. Apparently someone on the development team thought that making a good platformer meant reducing gameplay to the simplest level possible and simply tossing in all the formulaic jumps, pits, collectables, and worthless enemies necessary to join the genre. Well, that might be true, but it will also turn away all gamers who have been weaned on such gameplay mechanics from the beginning. This game does exactly that and will only be of interest to the youngest and most inexperienced of gamers in the N64 marketplace.  The game features two types of scrolling levels: the standard 2D side-view, and a more 2.5D forward-facing view in the vein of the popular Crash Bandicoot series on the PSX. While this forward scrolling view might give the appearance of being a true 3D platformer, rest assured it does not even come remotely close to entering the same pool of titles such as Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Tooie. Players are stuck running either forward or backward down a never-ending ~hallway~ through various environments and completing the same identical objectives as its 2D counterpart. The only difference being that instead of holding the control stick permanently to the right, you are now holding it permanently in the up direction with an occasional left or right twitch to mix things up. And when we say ~permanently~ holding the stick, that's no exaggeration. Most levels are so blatantly simple that even the most casual gamers can simply mash the stick forward and run straight through the levels, from start to finish. Level design is stylish in a fun cartoon way, but also extremely simple, short, and in the end -- boring.  The game unfolds with a nice cutscene detailing the plot of Daisy's capture by a mysterious villain. And what more do you need really? Daisy got nabbed, so Donald's off to save her, naturally. But no hero ever thinks to jump into an airplane and zoom right over to pick the damsel up. Instead Donald is naturally heading there on foot and must overcome many obstacles in the process. The action is split among 4 different worlds, including a forest, a city, and a haunted house. Each of these four worlds contains another four stages that can be completed in any order to unlock a fifth stage and then a final boss encounter stage. Players must collect the standard objects such as 100 stars for extra lives, all of the nephews' missing toys to open the fifth level, and token pieces to unlock the boss stage. These items are of course in plain view and are laughably easy to obtain. And around every turn you'll find some form of cute Disney enemy blocking your path, but luckily he has been given Spam for brains and simply walks repeatedly in circles, not even aware of your presence should you stand directly in front of him. One easy punch with the B button, and you're back to running full steam ahead once again.  One bright spot is the few nice character touches Donald has been given in standard Disney fashion. There's no life meter, but if for some random miracle an enemy should bump into Donald, then he'll burst into fits of rage -- swinging his arms wildly, quacking like a madman, and destroying everything in his path. It's a nice touch to see Donald all pissed-off throughout the game as we've grown to love him that way from childhood cartoon episodes. Should some blind stroke of luck arise and Donald is touched again by an environmental hazard, then you'll indeed lose a life and must start the level from the last checkpoint. Considering that lives are earned quite often throughout the game, this shouldn't be a concern whatsoever, so we highly recommend running into the first enemy encountered for the sake of cheap Donald laughs.  Graphics Despite the fact that Ubi Soft is reusing it's awesome Rayman 2 engine code, the visuals in this Donald Duck version simply don't compare. Perhaps it's unfair to judge the game in this manner, but many (including IGN64) had high hopes for the final graphics of this Disney action game simply because the last Rayman title was completely breathtaking, scoring a perfect 10 for graphics. Well for some reason, Donald and company can't quite come close to the same high level of quality pushed out of this engine a year ago, but on the other hand, the game does feature graphics that are slightly above the average for N64 titles. There are plenty of bright colored cartoon objects, backgrounds, and animations throughout the entire short-lived adventure. Even some nice extra touches have been added occasionally such as a random squirrel or pigeon scurrying across your path. Oddly enough, despite the simple nature of the title, gameplay doesn't exactly blaze along with the smoothest of framerates. It's hard to say if the onscreen graphical action is to blame, but regardless, the gameplay doesn't suffer because of it and is as easy as ever from start to finish.  Sound If a Donald Duck cartoon was ever set to music, then there's a slight chance it would sound somewhat similar to the tunes featured in Goin' Quackers. The MIDI instruments are all done rather well and feature a wide range drums, horns, strings, bells, and whistles, but the compositions themselves are a bit too short. It won't take long for gamers to realize that they've been listening to the exact same 25 seconds of classy elevator music looped repeatedly and endlessly. Fortunately the sound effects are good and suit the action quite nicely. There's even a decent amount of banter from old Donald himself as he plows through the level jumping and squeaking in his standard Donald way. The audio is right on par with the graphics in this case -- slightly better than the average N64 efforts of similar titles.I'm a huge, huge, fan of 2D side-scrolling games ever since the glory days of the great NES classics. Even today I still spend half of my gaming hours on such old-school titles because back then, gameplay was all they had. Sadly, the principle of clever gameplay fundamentals doesn't come home with Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers on the N64.  Instead we find a charming yet overly simple attempt to return to these classic gaming roots, and this isn't going to be enough to keep seasoned players glued to their controllers. At the very best, this game will keep younger players and newcomers smiling for a few days as they lazily breeze through the game. Even if you're a hardcore Disney and 2D action fan, you might consider renting this one and finishing it off quickly before going in for the purchase. If all else fails, just run out and hunt down some classic SNES Disney titles by Capcom to see how a true 2D side-scroller should really be done.", "date": "Dec 15, 2000"}
