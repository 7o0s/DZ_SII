While the company's most well known series is undoubtedly Final Fantasy,  Square has released almost as many different games in its SaGa series. SaGa Frontier 2 is the latest game in this long running series that began on Nintendo's Game Boy.   While it was popular in Japan, the original SaGa Frontier didn't manage to garner the same success in North America. In many cases, American gamers pass on great Japanese RPG's released here because they aren't marketed well or the graphics just aren't good enough. However, in this case, the main reason that it failed in the U.S. was that the game was a big pile of shite.   In an effort to make a game with non-linear gameplay with an infinite replay value, Square managed to produce one of its worst games ever. SaGa Frontier is one game that most Square fans would like to forget. Luckily, it appears that Square knows that it missed that boat on the original Saga Frontier and has brought back some of the original's good features, while getting rid of many of the bad and adding a wealth of excellent new ones to its sequel.   Gameplay The most important aspect of any RPG is arguably its storyline. A deep and involving plot can easily make players forget about weak graphics or a lackluster combat system. While it is a hundred times better than the hellish original, the story in SaGa Frontier 2 isn't that inspiring.   At the onset of the game, the player is presented with the option of partaking in one of two storylines. In one, the story follows Gustav XIII, the son of the king who is exiled by his father because of his lack of magical abilities. The second plotline covers the exploits of a young magic using treasure hunter looking to expose the secret of his father's disappearance.   In each scenario, players will encounter different characters and can follow various unique paths. And while they are pretty linear in nature, they do offer some freedom for the player. While all this may seem fine and dandy, the truth is that the story just isn't that good. The problem isn't that it's too linear, it isn't that it's too free, nor is it that the base plotline is really generic. What's wrong with the story is that it's just not that interesting and Square's writing in the game is extremely bland.   None of the game's characters, playable or non-playable, have interesting personalities. Most of the townsfolk have nothing interesting to say and speak as if they're reading out of a book meant for young schoolchildren.   The text boxes are filled with non-sensible blocks of words that have been arranged in ways that would never come out of a person's mouth in any normal conversation. The grammar isn't bad, per se, but text in a role-playing game shouldn't read like text out of a news article or review, it should read as if it is being spoken by a real person.   While it's arguable that a lot of casual RPG fans aren't as concerned with well-written text, the lifeless dialogue really sticks out like a sore thumb because players are stuck doing nothing but reading text for large portions of the game. So, you can either read through the dull text or just spend some 20 minutes just repeatedly pressing the button to skip it.   This problem is actually encountered right out of the gate as the game puts the player through about 30 minutes worth of text reading before the first real battle. Instead of creating an awe-inspiring CG or animated intro to help setup the game's plot, SaGa Frontier 2 puts players through a half hour of tedious button pressing to get through the lackluster setup of the game's story.   After the storyline and character development, most diehards would say that the battle system is the next most important element of a role-playing game. It's too bad that SaGa Frontier 2 fails in the first two areas because its battle system is extremely good.   The combat menus are quite intuitive and players can pick and choose from a wide array of weapons and attacks during battle without much effort. Just as was the case in the first SaGa Frontier, players can improve the skills of the characters with each weapon as they use a particular weapon more frequently.   One of the game's unique features is the ability to fight battles as a team or one-on-one. In situations where your party encounters a single enemy, you're given the option to fight it as a group or solo. In ~group~ battles, the system is similar to most traditional RPGs, where the player chooses the actions of each character and then the actions are completed. But in the duel mode, things are a little different. When fighting one-on-one, players get to put together wild combo attacks and are given the chance to hone specific skills and abilities.    Graphics The area where SaGa Frontier 2 excels the most is the same area that might keep dim-witted, 3D-obsessed gamers away from it, the graphics. Players used to 3D polygonal graphics or even games with a mixture of 2D character graphics on 3D polygonal backgrounds might see SaGa Frontier 2 as a step back in terms of technical achievement.    However, I honestly believe that, graphically, SaGa Frontier 2 is one of the most visually appealing games on the system. Instead of the computer generated graphics that have become the norm in today's game's, all of the graphics in this game are hand drawn. The 2D backgrounds have been hand painted and are extremely detailed and downright beautiful.   Whilst the backgrounds are visually impressive, the normal characters in the game aren't really animated that well, nor are the really that appealing. Some of the large enemy bosses, on the other hand, are awe-inspiring and do the wonderful background graphics justice.   Sound The music in SaGa Frontier 2 is filled with a good mix of passionately orchestrated tunes that fit the general mood of the game perfectly. The only real flaw with the game's music is that while it is good, it's not really that memorable. In other words, fans of Japanese RPG musical soundtracks won't likely find the urge to replace their Chrono Cross, Final Fantasy, or Xenogears soundtracks with this one in their CD player.   One other complaint with the game's audio is that none of the characters have voices. You can still have a great role-playing game without having voices for the characters, but I find it to be a key feature in what helps makes a great game a classic. Not only is it a nice extra feature, but if it's done well, it does wonders in helping create memorable characters that the player can fall in love with. The characters in SaGa Frontier 2 could really have used this.After the dismal SaGa Frontier, I wasn't excited one bit when I heard that Square was working on a follow-up. However, as details about the game seeped out and everyone learned that many changes were being done to the game, my interest in the game increased. Based on what Square said about the game, it appeared that it had done away with all of the bad aspects of the first SaGa Frontier, and replaced them with an array of good ones. After thoroughly playing SaGa Frontier 2, I have come to the conclusion that it is indeed a huge improvement over its predecessor. The non-linear, non-focused story arch of the first one has been replaced with a better-developed, more linear story. Additionally, almost all of the changes that were done to the game's battle system increased the depth and entertainment of the combat significantly. As much of an improvement over the original that it is, SaGa Frontier 2 is still only a slightly above average game. The story is put together better than in the original, but it lacks emotion and isn't the least bit inspiring. What makes it worse is that the way the game's setup, players are forced to go long periods of time between fights to further the game's plot. If it had an interesting storyline like Xenogears or Lunar: Silver Star Story this wouldn't be that big of a deal. But SaGa Frontier 2's story doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as those two RPGs. If you're a diehard RPG fan who must play through every single RPG released in the U.S. just to make sure that companies keep bringing them out here, then you may want to pick up this one. But, don't expect a great role-playing experience because it's only a slightly above average game. If you have a job, a girlfriend, friends, a pet monkey, or any sort of life, you could spend your time much more wisely than with this game.", "date": "Feb 18, 2000"}
