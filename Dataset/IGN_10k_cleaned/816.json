Crazy Taxi, Speed Devils, Hydro Thunder, and every other engined competition under the sun have continued to flourish on SEGA's powerhouse. It's no surprise then, that with the arrival of spring (and a large injection of new software) that yet another title in the genre is vying for your attention. Brought to you by Player 1 (the same people responsible for Robotron X and Dead in the Water), Roadsters hopes to be the newest object of your affection. Regrettably, Player 1's newest jaunt may not live up to said expectations.   In a premise similar to the aforementioned Speed Devils, Roadsters is the latest attempt at arcade-style racing. Following the same formula you've seen in Cruis'n USA and various other wannabes over the last few years, realistic physics have been thrown out the window. While an over the top engine usually means more ~pick-up and go~ fun than your average sim, Roadsters doesn't quite meet that standard. Sure you can ram yourself into barriers and run off the road without demolishing your vehicle, but what's the point if you're smashing into objects more than you're rolling on the pavement?   Auto freaks will be happy to know that the cars at your disposal are real ones. Boasting different colors and trannies, there's a small level of customization at your fingertips. While no where near the selection found in the Gran Turismo series, you can spruce up your Renault or TVR on the fly with just a few button presses. Whether you're an advocate of the stock, sport, or formula models there's probably some version of a car in there that you're willing to exploit. There's even a nod to real-life race hounds that let's you add a few nitro canisters for a little extra oomph (too bad they're more of a novelty than a necessity).   Well, it looks good standing still... Once you've selected your car and head to the track (with a surprisingly small amount of options; career, time attack, versus, and exhibition) you are thrown right into the fray. Matched up with seven other opponents, a quick three count whooshes you into a steadily faster contest. As the first few seconds are ripe with cars bumping and smashing into each other from all angles, you'll eventually make it out of the pile and head out onto the course. That is, until the control scheme forces you to steer into some blockade that stops you dead in your tracks.   And that's what turns out to be the common difficulty with Roadsters -- the control. Utilizing a layout that promotes the use of the digital pad, intuition goes way of the dinosaur. This is the Dreamcast, after all, and it just takes a little too much time to get used to. Unfortunately, the control ends up being a little too touchy, and attempting to keep your car from smashing into the side of the track is a practice you'll soon have to master as the squishy response time isn't very forgiving when you want to go straight. What makes things even more trying is the fact that you can't customize the controls effectively. Basically, it only lets you swap the camera angles and shift gears, and a return to old school racing manipulation is a no-no.   The tracks themselves are pretty straight-forward. Spin round and round on what is essentially a big oval three or four times and the race is over. Slight jagged turns and a few alternate pathways liven up the monotony a bit, but are eventually overshadowed by they're own distracting obviousness. The developers attempted some creativity with the course design (using such strange settings as a ski resort, Area 51, and a rocket-launching site) but it all falls flat. Despite the wild atmospheres and their possibilities, the team never really took advantage of them and every level appears to evolve into an inactive backdrop -- disguising what is fundamentally the same track over and over again, it is potential unrealized.   The biggest problem with Roadsters, however, has to be the graphics. Sticking out like a sore thumb, the visuals have apparently been lifted from a first-generation PlayStation game. There's polygon-sparkle galore and every object onscreen (including supposedly rough items like trees and barns) glitters like a Las Vegas female impersonator. The framerate suffers terribly too, and never seems to break 20 to 25 FPS in solo mode, with the multiplayer action falling even lower. The poor resolution adds to an already bad visual presentation. Huge pixilated textures and ugly lighting effects continue to reveal an increased amount of graphical glitches that seem to get worse with time. The only redeeming eye candy I could find were in the weather effects. Occasional snow flakes, realistic lightning bolts, and a very cool solar eclipse managed to grab me, but couldn't save an otherwise lost cause.I had high hopes for Roadsters. A casual fan of Speed Devils and other classic arcade wheelers like Hard Drivin', I wanted it to be something special but this isn't it.  Easter eggs and secrets aside, there's not much to hold your interest after the first few races. Plus, it's graphically horrendous and ergonomically frustrating. It's time to start praying that Bizarre Creations' upcoming Metropolis and Midways 4-Wheel follow-up to Hydro Thunder don't suffer the same fate. Do yourself a favor, and race somewhere else.", "date": "Mar 28, 2000"}
