When gamers hear the term associated with a particular title, they become wary of said title and mentally classify it under a very distinct and repetitive experience. But for some gamers, button-mashing isn't necessarily a bad thing, and that's very clear when looking at the fan following of Koei's various Warriors franchises, which are almost universally labeled as button-mashers. Some people just enjoy that kind of experience and that's what you're going to get when you play Warriors Orochi on the PC.   Warriors Orochi was first released on the 360 and PS2 last September and just recently made an appearance on the PSP in a somewhat scaled back, but still respectable, portable form. Now the title has wound its way into the world of digital distribution and can be downloaded for $29.99. In case you haven't kept up with the previous versions, Warriors Orochi combines the worlds of the Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors series together to form an all-out battle against the demon lord Orochi and his sinister legions. Wicked.   Musou attack! Unfortunately, a massive culmination of times, places and heroes doesn't come together for Warriors Orochi because the Warriors games have never truly nailed down a solid story or ritzy presentation. But before we delve too deeply into that, let's cover the basics. Warriors Orochi lets you command a team of three characters from an impressively huge roster and work through a series of campaigns organized by kingdom. Most of your time, like other Warriors titles, will be spent hacking your way through hundreds of enemies, taking out occasional officers and accomplishing minor objectives during a mission.   Although you can obviously map different commands to your keyboard, I found this style of action game to be somewhat unintuitive for keyboard support (you apparently can't map anything to your mouse). Although plugging in a gamepad is preferable, the keyboard still works -- just not as well. Combat is all about using a sequence of Normal attacks followed by a Charge attack to end the combo. As usual, any character has a Musou attack that can clear a large number of enemies and deal some heavy damage to opposing officers. You also have the option to fight on horseback as well as a few techniques that can be executed mid-jump.   The catch with Warriors Orochi is the tag-team dynamic, which lets you customize a team with characters belonging to the Power, Speed or Technique categories and swap between them at any time. As I've mentioned in my reviews of the other platform versions, it's always disappointing to not see a team attack built into the combat mechanics, but chaining together Musou attacks is a step in the right direction.   Angry or sleepy? This version of Warriors Orochi seems to be almost identical to the 360 version, but PC owners should note that there are no widescreen resolutions available when playing -- the image is stretched and the resolution doesn't even go terribly high. The game once again sports pop-in, embarrassingly bland textures and empty environments. Although it runs just fine during actual combat, the whole experience feels barren, especially on the PC, which can do so much more than what's happening here.   The story and voice acting in Warriors Orochi are sincerely lacking also, but the real issue here is whether or not you appreciate the aforementioned button-mashing. If you enjoy pounding away on the same buttons for hours with virtually no thought needed, than this game delivers just that. Warriors Orochi offers plenty of content for the button-mashing enthusiast and once again delivers insane potential for character leveling (try maxing out over seventy warriors). These titles can be fun in small doses and will certainly please gamers who like straight-forward gameplay, but I greatly prefer combat systems with more depth and the promise of challenging combos.   Lastly, I should mention that playing co-op locally with another player on the same PC is very unusual. Unless you have an extra gamepad lying around, chances are you won't huddle together at one keyboard and pound away on buttons together -- unless you're very close...Warriors Orochi is a raw button-masher with a lot of opportunity for character leveling. If you haven't yet played Warriors Orochi for any other platform and you want to see the Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors franchises come together, this is a tolerable way to do it. But this title is ultimately more of the same button-mashing you've seen time and time again and the content doesn't look particularly impressive on a PC, which can run much prettier (and more robust) titles.", "date": "Mar 26, 2008"}
