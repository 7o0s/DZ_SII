Unfortunately, apart from the obvious upgrades in the graphics department, NASCAR 99 isn't a better game than the PSX racer -- as a matter of fact, it's actually a little worse in most respects.The Facts 18 real tracks and more than 31 official drivers plus six NASCAR legends (including Jeff Gordon, Dale Earnhardt, Mark Martin, Terry Labonte, Bobby Labonte, Darrel Waltrip, Earnie Irvan, Rusty Wallace, Jeremy Mayfield, John Andretti, Ricky Craven, Steve Park, Kenny Irwin Jr., Kenny Wallace, Jeff Burton, Ted Musgrave, Johnny Benson, Kenny Schrader, Ricky Rudd, Michael Waltrip, Bill Elliott, Dale Jarett, Sterling Marlin, Bobby Hamilton, Ward Burton, Geoff Bodine, David Green, Hut Stricklin, Kyle Petty, Mike Skinner and Dick Trickle. Legends: Richard Petty, Cale Yarborough, Alan Kulwichi, Bobby Alison, Davey Allison and Benny Parsons) In-game music by Joe Satriani and Stevie Ray Vaughan Custom vehicle options Play-by-play commentary by Bob Jenkins and Benny Parsons Three gameplay modes including quick race, single race and championship In-game driver and car info Track records Replay function (albeit limited) Rumble Pak support Preset steering wheel support (w/analog pedal support) Two-player simultaneous split-screen races Real-time lighting effects and specular highlighting Controller Pak requiredGameplayIn order to make NASCAR's mostly oval-based racing more accessible to the younger N64 audience, developer Stormfront Studios increased the arcade elements over last year's PSX version and cut back on sim elements. We're not sure whether that was such a smart idea, since NASCAR fans tend to be more into tweaking their cars and accurate handling than fast-paced racing action. Let's face it, if you're looking for an arcade racer, you want curving tracks that require quick reactions -- not ovals.Nevertheless, NASCAR certainly has some important sim racing trimmings, such as 18 tracks, including well-rendered versions of Sears Point and Watkins Glen as well as a day and a night version of Bristol. NASCAR fans will also be happy to note that Indianapolis has finally made the cut -- Dover Downs and Daytona are still missing. Car setup is a bit limited, but sufficient for the majority of gamers. To get the most out of your car, you can adjust rear spoiler, wedge, tire pressure, gear ratio and watch the settings' impact on speed, acceleration, handling and pit distance with the help of some handy bar diagrams.Although NASCAR 99 features a realistic drafting effect and pretty good handling, the control is a lot more forgiving than in last year's game. The question remains whether this makes NASCAR 99 more accessible as an arcade racer, since the style of racing and the need for downshifting (or letting go of the accelerator) remains intact. Unfortunately, the car also doesn't feel heavy enough -- a little more tilting and drifting would have added a more realistic look and feel and made driving a much more satisfying experience.Still, there is also a lot to like in NASCAR 99. Stormfront created exciting crash visuals and plenty of cool smoke effects to satisfy full-contact drivers -- and the attention to detail and sense of speed is definitely there. If you're looking for more racing and less crashing, some customization of the game's pre-race options help turn NASCAR 99 into a more realistic NASCAR racer. By adjusting the preset ~arcade~ settings (including opponent strength, drafting effect, horse power, car balance and speed sensitive steering), switching yellow flags on, and toggling damage and equipment breakdown, NASCAR 99 offers enough to satisfy most sim racing fans. But even then, there are a few pitfalls: the lack of a rearview mirror, a completely worthless in-cockpit view (which covers up too much of the screen and lacks any sort of spotter or map options), collision detection glitches, and the inability to make pitstops when yellow flags are up.MultiplayerUnlike most racers, NASCAR puts up a respectable two-player mode with six other AI drivers on the track (as compared to 19 in the one-player mode). It would have been cool if Stormfront could have added a two-player Season mode, but it's certainly a step up from the weak two-player vs. modes in the majority of N64 racing games.GraphicsNASCAR's graphics are adequate, but uneventful as N64 racers go. Framerates are smooth, the tracks feature all the right elements and tribunes and the car decals are quite detailed, but it seems as if the developer opted to simplify everything in order to keep the game running smoothly. Sure, a NASCAR track is not the most visually impressive scenery out there, but with the exception of the skies, NASCAR 99's textures are just too bland and boring. A little more variation could have gone a long way. Even important details like the racing line and shadows are done poorly. On top of everything, there is quite a lot of fade-in, much like in the infamous Cruis'n series. The cars, which show visible damage after crashes and some spiffy lighting effects, are also a bit too boxy and lack detail -- but the simple design allows the game to run smoothly with many cars on screen. Luckily, all the special effects are right on. As cars crash into walls, sparks fly and white smoke billows out of stalled vehicles without affecting framerates too much (usually a side effect of alpha channeling). The cockpit view graphics, including the driver's hands steering and changing gears, are showy but useless since you can't see the track. Go for the first-person (no cockpit) view for best results.SoundIf you're only playing your games through your TV's speakers, NASCAR 99's audio is convincing enough, with decent engine sounds (that sound different depending on whether you're using the cockpit or the third-person views) and digitized tunes by Joe Satriani and Stevie Ray Vaughan. But like in so many quick conversions, the audio streams are muffled -- an effect that becomes more prominent when listening to the sound through a stereo (or surround) system. The cartridge format has also taken its toll on the announcers' vocabulary. After hearing Benny Parsons and Bob Jenkins exclaim ~watch out!~ and ~man, oh, man!~ for the third time, you will probably be happy about the option to mute the play-by-play.Head-to-HeadUnfortunately, the N64 version isn't quite up to par with the PlayStation NASCAR 99 (or NASCAR 98, for that matter). The PSX NASCAR 99 is a little better, with cleaner audio and slightly better controls. Also, you compete against 23 other racers in the PSX version, compared to 19 on the N64. On the flipside, the N64 version has better graphics and no load time. Still, we recommend the PSX version.An above average racer that suffers from one major problem: It tries to be both arcade racer and sim racer, and doesn't truly excel as either one. But with only F-1 World Grand Prix as its major competition in the sim racing genre on N64, NASCAR 99 is fun enough for most gamers looking for a more serious racer than Top Gear or Rush. However, unless you're a die-hard NASCAR fan or a true racing nut, I suggest renting the game first before purchasing your own copy.", "date": "Oct 22, 1998"}
