But these aren't really the worst games ever made, they're just the most notoriously bad. The worst games tend to come and go relatively unnoticed, insulting just the few poor saps that bought them before being forgotten entirely. Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots for the Game Boy Advance is a game so bad that it'll be hard to forget about it.    Fresh off their previous crapfest, Harlem Globetrotters World Tour, publisher DSI and developer Full Fat obviously felt the gaming public hadn't been punished enough. So they dropped their pants and squeezed out a handheld videogame rendition of the classic Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots toy. Putting aside that the original toy wasn't too much fun to begin with, it's hard to understand who could have possibly greenlit a project like this. Exactly what about a stationary, two-robot punching toy screams Game Boy Advance? Surprisingly, it's not the awkward brand that makes this game awful, it's the shoddy programming, horrible gameplay and lazy art. Game developers that want to teach their employees exactly how not to make handheld games might be the only audience for this game.    The game stars the red and blue robots from the original toy, along with some palette-swapped variations to create the illusion of a full roster of opponents. In the game, the robots have been freed of their bases and can walk and hop around. They fight each other in outer space environments and constructions sites; don't ask why, because the game offers zero story. As a robot, you can walk left and right, jump and deliver a few basic punches. Street Fighter-style games do not get much worse than this. As in the original toy, your robot's arms are controlled independently; so the B button delivers a punch with the left hand and the A button delivers one with the right hand. Holding down either button allows for a more powerful punch.    None of this is necessary to learn though, since every single fight in the game can be won in exactly six seconds by holding to the right and mashing the A button. It's true; regardless of the opponent, the level or which title fight you're in, every opponent can be drained of their energy by pressing one button for six seconds. Because of this, you can climb to the top of the ranks in a little over two minutes (including menus and loading) and play through everything the game has to offer in about 20 minutes, which is still probably more time than went into designing this pathetic excuse for a game. It's easy to call the AI in this game awful, but that's assuming the programmers actually bothered actually creating AI to begin with.   When your opponent is out of energy, you'll have to mash the L and R buttons alternately in order to beat his lifeless robot body to death and, like the toy, knock his block off. What's ridiculous is just how fast you have to press the L and R buttons in order to pull this off. I found myself having to move my thumbs to the top of my Game Boy in order to toggle fast enough to build up the meter and destroy my metallic opponent. Young kids, however will likely have no chance of pulling this off and if you can't alternate between the L and R buttons fast enough, you cannot win a fight in this game. It's a horrible, inexcusable design flaw that will frustrate the majority of young gamers who are unlucky enough to receive this title.    There are three modes in this game, but they're all pretty much the same. Classic mode has you fighting the blue robot against the red one. Versus mode has you fighting any-colored robots against one other. Title Fight mode has you selecting a robot and fighting your way up through about five opponents. As robots are defeated in the Title Fight mode, new robots are unlocked (the word new is used loosely, as they're the same robots you just fought against, except now you can control them). And that's all this game has to offer. There are no training mini-games, no multiplayer modes, no options other than audio volume and round time...nothing. Not only is this game horrible, but there's not even much here to hate.    Each of the robot fighters in this game looks pretty much identical to the others, except for the color palette. They shuffle and attack with limited, poorly-done animations. Even though there are a few different attacks available, they all look pretty much the same. Even worse than the animation is how these robots are handled programmatically. They lurch forward awkwardly and twitch between animations, which looks like they're having a seizure. If you happened to vomit on your GBA while playing this game (which, given the quality, is a distinct possibility) it will probably start to look better than it does now.       Music alternates between a repetitive, Casio keyboard-style beat in the menus, and guitar-driven metal during the fights. Sound effects are...well, sound effect, since it feels like there's only one used in the entire game: a generic punch sound. Beyond that, this game is pretty dead silent.    Each time you reach the top of the fighting ranks, you receive a password that can be re-entered the next time you play. The only reason for the password is to let you keep your full robot roster in Title Fight mode, which is exactly the same roster that can be used without a password in the Versus mode. The odds that you'll actually play this game more than once and require a password are pretty slim anyway. If you're reading this review and already own a copy of this game, bite the bullet, get that $1 of trade-in credit at Gamestop and live happier.   Santa should stop handing out coal to the bad kids this year and invest in a few thousand copies of this game; coal at least can be used for a fire. This game has no other purpose than to disappoint everyone who buys it, and shame everyone who worked on it. It is the single worst game I've ever played on the Game Boy Advance and should be avoided at all costs.", "date": "Dec 14, 2006"}
