Now the title's finally coming out here in the States and, in my opinion at least, it's about damn time. We've managed to spend a fair bit of time with an early copy of the US version and have been really pleased with the experience. Sure, there are a few problems that ought to have been addressed, but the overall experience of playing Codename Panzers is undeniably enjoyable.  For those who don't know, Codename Panzers follows the recent (and completely welcome) trend in the industry towards offering a nice middle ground between the worlds of staid, unfathomable  wargames and traditional, slightly cartoonish RTS clones. It's as if someone has finally realized that we can have it both ways -- mixing the idea of realistic military action found in Combat Mission with the accessibility of something like Command and Conquer. Some of these efforts, like the recent Desert Rats vs. Afrika Korps are merely passable. Others, like Soldiers: Heroes of World War 2 seem like a revelation. It is to this latter category that Codename Panzers belongs.  In this game you'll lead forces from four nations in three campaigns. The German campaign lets players invade Poland and push on through to Russia, the Russian campaign tasks you with repelling the attack and throwing the Germans back to their own capital, and the ~Allied~ campaign sees you leading American troops from the drops before D-Day though some city fighting in early 1945. Along the way, you'll also have the chance to take charge of the British forces at Arnhem. Though many of the big name battles are represented here, they're done on a fairly local scale. So, for instance, when you find yourself at the Battle of the Bulge, you'll merely have to protect a single fuel depot.   Codename Panzers often switches you from the defensive to the offensive side of battles, sometimes within the space of a single mission. When you capture a town or important asset, you can almost always bank on a vigorous counter-attack by your enemies. There's usually a fair bit of tactical variety between the missions as well. In the Bulge mission for instance, you're in charge of the reserves, lending help where needed as Germans try to pound through a line of AI-led American troops. A similar approach is taken during the Normandy landing mission. Here you're simply supposed to assault the coastal defenses from the rear and the AI leads the landing of American forces.  You'll almost never have more than 25 units under your command and frequently, particularly early on, you'll only have a dozen or so. Having that few troops under your control eases the pain of management a bit but you'll still need to be aware of what types of troops are best used for particular situations. Since you'll have a mixed force of armor, artillery and various types of infantry, finding the match-ups that work is key to winning battles.  Since they gain experience during battles, it's very important at higher difficulty levels that you not waste your units. You'll have the opportunity to buy new units between missions by spending prestige points. These are earned by completing mission objectives. You'll also earn bonus points for completing the enigmatic optional objectives. While it's great fun to build your own customized force, the game ought to present you with more information about what types of troops you're likely to need in the upcoming fight. Moreover, by the end of each of the three campaigns, you'll have more prestige than you can spend while staying under the 25-unit cap. The AI is reasonably challenging but once you master the art of isolating small elements of the enemy army and defeating them in detail, you can walk through many of the missions without every losing a single unit.  In terms of interface, things are fairly easy. Anyone who's played an RTS in the last ten years should have no trouble understanding the concepts and controls behind this game within the first five minutes of playing it. It's a standard right-click affair and the few complications are almost always managed for you by the game's AI. If troops need to go prone to avoid enemy fire, they'll do so on their own. If they need to lob a few Molotov cocktails at an approaching tank, they'll put their machine guns away just long enough to get a toss off.  Though the game captures the flavor of World War 2 combat very well, there are plenty of concessions to realism here. Weapons are underpowered both in terms of range and damage potential. Guns that could take out enemy vehicles in one shot from all the way across the map now find that their range barely extends the length of the screen and they'll still have to pump a few shots into even the weakest enemies before they're destroyed.   Sometimes you don't even want to destroy your enemy's hardware. You just want to damage the crew enough that you can take it over. This is easiest (and almost automatic) when dealing with crewed guns. Just send your riflemen to attack the artillery pieces and anti-tank guns and they'll shoot the crew. You can then move your own men over to man the gun and turn it against your enemy. You can also use flamethrowers and Molotov cocktails to heat up enemy vehicles to the point that the crew bails out. All you have to do then is wait for the vehicle to cool down and send your own crew in to man it. It's not entirely accurate from a historical perspective, but it makes for a fun (if not often practical) game mechanic.      That's not to say that there's not a fair bit of realistic modeling in the game. Vehicles have separate armor values for their different facings, for instance, and you'll find it often works best if you can take your enemies from behind. One interesting interface feature to note is that the bounding box around each unit will offer a graphical representation of how much damage each armor facing has taken. Shots to weakened sides will do more damage to those units.  Managing the separate trucks for both repairing your units and supplying them with ammunition is another concession to realism that's handled in a fairly simple way. Simply park the trucks next to a unit that needs to be repaired or resupplied and the game takes care of the rest. This is in contrast to Soldiers: Heroes of World War 2 where you actually had to manage all this personally. The other trucks in the game are used to move artillery and infantry around but the maps aren't really large enough to make them very useful. Moreover, with as few units as you'll have at any time, you really don't want to split them up and, given the 25-unit limit, I'd much rather take something that shoots.  In keeping with the whole combined arms focus of the game, you'll sometimes be able to call in strikes from resources off the map. These usually take the form of air strikes and reconnaissance patrols but you'll sometimes have artillery bombardments and paratrooper drops. The speed with which the fighter-bombers respond is so fast as to be completely laughable but it's still a nice touch to be able to soften up your enemy's defenses before you commit your ground forces.   The Gepard engine that powers Panzers' visuals is undeniably impressive and the moveable camera lets you a good look at it from nearly every angle. I will say that I prefer the slightly more realistic, more physics-driven look of Soldiers: Heroes of World War 2 but this is partly a matter of taste. There's still a lot of realistic liveliness to be found in Panzers. Each of the units is modeled and shaded in a very believable manner and the brilliant animations only heighten the sense of realism and personality.  This personality is sometimes lost in the cutscenes simply because there aren't any facial animations. Still, the bodies move so realistically and look so good in the close-ups that you have to respect the work that Stormregion has done to bring these sequences to life. Cutscenes that tend to focus on vehicles are obviously a bit less stiff.  The engine handles destruction very well and nearly everything you see can be destroyed to at least some extent. Buildings can be shelled into rubble and trees and fences can be steamrolled by your tanks. The explosions in Soldiers seem to have a bit more weight; those in Panzers, while impressive, seem just a little too much like video game effects. Still, they're very good video game effects, so you probably won't find yourself complaining too much. I, after all, am paid to do it.  Things are much less impressive on the sound front. There are some nice touches here and there -- when you click on a heavily damaged tank the unit acknowledgement crackles and hisses, for instance -- but, for the most part, the sound work is largely average. I do like the music used here and its character and quality match the subject matter very well. I don't really care for the voice acting however. Admittedly, it's not a crucial component of gameplay but it does tend to distract you from time to time, particularly when the accents start to drop in and out.  The game ships with a cooperative multiplayer mode but we haven't had much chance to try it out yet. The game is, after all, not due out for a couple of weeks yet. Given the fun of the single player game, and the almost total lack of cooperative RTS games, it's sure to be a hit once the servers start filling up. In the end, if you like exploring the interesting interactions between different types of infantry and a variety of armored vehicles, Codename Panzers is the game for you. Soldiers: Heroes of World War 2 has slightly better graphics and drivable vehicles but the size and variety of the forces you'll have at any time aren't as great as you'll find in Panzers.Some of the rougher edges might detract from the game's strengths but, to be honest, the game quickly moves you past any weak points. The important thing is that the game consistently delivers the interesting and varied tactical challenges that seem to be missing from so many other real-time strategy games.Simply put, fans of real-time strategy games can't go wrong with this one.Now bring on Phase Two!", "date": "Sep 16, 2004"}
