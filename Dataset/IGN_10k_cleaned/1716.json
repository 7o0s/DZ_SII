Argonaut had no idea either what to do with the PlayStation version of Emperor, but they charged ahead and came up with a similar free-form kind of surprise (the game begins with a bizarre pinball sim, and goes haywire from there).     Too bad inspiration didn't strike thrice. With the Game Boy Color version, the developers went straight-and-narrow with all of the bad conventions and traditions of platform gaming, and the result tends to be too strict and stiff for its source material.    Features  Master moves like charges, headbutts, and spitting  Highcolor mode for menu and cutscenes  Battery back-up for game saves Only for Game Boy Color   What Sandbox Studios unfortunately wound up with was a blocky platformer with little humor to distract players from the rigid controls. Being in control of a llama, with a tall neck built on an awkward body, isn't such a great thing for a platformer, since Kuzco (the lead character) is always hitting his head on the tops of platforms. The control is stiff enough as it is, but with Kuzco conking himself out to an instant death on the ceilings over pits and chasms, the game is really frustrating.  Emperor's New Groove starts off well enough, building plenty of skills to add to the llama's bag of tricks. He can charge, head-butt, and (best of all) projectile-spit. Trouble is, half of the game's control is more frustrating than it's worth. The head-butt is really wonky and hard to aim, since the llama sometimes stretches his neck over an enemy and other times (when you miss slightly) takes damage in mid-swing if an enemy is just out of range and walks into his head. Taking out flying bats is naturally tough with a head-butt, but pounding slow-moving slug-things should have been a piece of cake. Then you have to experiment to find out what enemies can be killed and what can't -- only half will die from a head-butt, and the other half will hurt you instead. The charge move would have helped make the attacks more useful, but charges don't kill, so while it's fun to tear around the stages at full speed, you'll be stopped in your tracks when you just get to enjoy it.  The one exception? Spitting is a freakin' blast. I love spitting in videogames, ever since Mario coughed up fireballs on the NES. The spitting here is another snicker-snagging good time, and Sandbox made the most of it. You can launch spit on the run, practice your spits by nailing a spittoon at ten paces with a flying spurt... You can even bank a lurch off a corner post like a cue ball. How rad is that?  I don't know that this could ever have been a great game -- the graphics have detail in the animation (with flowing hair visible on Kuzco), but then the characters are really stiff and lifeless -- but I sure would have enjoyed the saliva gland downtime while sucking up a spitwad a lot more if the control of the rest of the game wasn't so unyielding. You traipse around the stage bonking on every platform and every celiling trying to make simple leaps, or else crunching your noggin on enemies that looked like they'd go down with a head-butt. Something a lot more loose and diverse would have let some of these flaws be acceptable -- if the platform stages were just one or two bummer levels in between all kinds of odd mini-games like in the PlayStation version, then it would have had a better chance of capturing the wild, spontaneous spirit of the movie.", "date": "Jan 13, 2001"}
