Specifically, they must dream of second analog sticks, since making 3D games with only one is remarkably tough. It's tough to do well, anyway, and having that backup stick would help quiet a bit. But certain games come along and make the best of the situation, and From Russia with Love is a good example.   The game is a port of the console version, and for the most part it plays the same. Everything from the storyline and weapons, to the cutscenes and level design, has made the leap from console to portable. Thankfully, much of the console experience survived the transition - no easy feat. In fact, this process has plagued a number of adaptations in the past. It doesn't really matter if the game in question comes from a noble franchise or from a killer movie license; the fact is most portable versions of consoles games don't offer the same experience.    And while From Russia with Love wasn't a groundbreaking action game on consoles, and truth be told it's not on PSP either, it's still an enjoyable romp in the world of lighthearted espionage. And thanks to intuitive controls, it doesn't feel like you're missing out on the console experience due the PSP's hardware. Better still, PSP owners score a bunch of exclusive mini-games and multiplayer modes not included in the original version, so there's a good amount of replay value. Finally, the menus, interface and load times all benefit from a good deal of polish, all of which help make the title feel pretty slick.  To start, though, it serves to dive into a few basics. The action splits into eight main missions, all of which split even further into 30-plus stages. There's a good amount of variety in here, and you'll find yourself doing different things often. Some of the stages have you blasting around in a jetpack, for instance, while others have you protecting friendly characters by sniping from a rooftop. Others still see you rescuing hostages from a Gypsy camp, diffusing explosives or raiding factories filled with armed thugs. So while the game is primarily action (there's little stealth for a game about spies) it's fun and varied.    Here's a recap on controls for those who may have missed earlier coverage: you can choose between two different configurations. The first, and perhaps best, let us control the character with the analog stick. The face buttons control a majority of the action, including reload, wall cover, crouch, focus mode and dive roll. They also control camera movement - you can pan the camera left or right by pressing the square and circle buttons. The directional buttons let you select weapons and gadgets, while shoulder buttons control weapons fire and zoom functions. You can also change the configuration so that the analog stick handles character control while the face buttons let you move the aim reticule.       The above system works well once you're used to it. Having camera control mapped to the face buttons is a little awkward at first, but the feeling fades quickly and ultimately it works out rather well. Switching weapons through the easily accessible menu is also a big plus, as it lets you manage inventory without fumbling your style in the middle of a gunfight.   There's also a good deal of context-sensitivity, so rappelling down walls and other spy'ish activities are simple to pull off. It does, of course, wind up feeling overly simple at times, but it's probably better than struggling with a complex, unintuitive system. The ideal solution would be to marry a complex system with intuitive controls, but you can't always get what you want. But, as previously mentioned, the system in place works just fine and helps streamline the action.   The multiplayer experience reflects the rest of the game, in that it's fun, simple to pick up, varied and yet a little rough. You can choose four match types, including the classic deathmatch and domination modes, as well as a few jetpack-based modes. Each match is fun, different and easy to set up and start. Plus, you can even play a few of the modes alone by using the game's AI bots. This in particular helps elevate From Russia with Love from other multiplayer PSP games. Making things even better are the maps, which boast pretty good design, traps and the like. There aren't many (you can choose four) but three of them are exclusive to the PSP build and they make for good matches.   Having said all of that, From Russia with Love does suffer from a few issues. For starters, the camera tends to get stuck behind walls, tables and the like. Not all the time, but it happens more than it should. Certain levels in the game feel rushed, too, and you'll therefore notice tears and a bunch of other graphical glitches. Along the same lines, the entire experience suffers from poor performance, so you'll rarely notice a stable framerate. All in all, these aren't game-shattering problems. It's nothing that a little extra development time couldn't have easily fixed.    From Russia with Love successfully translates the console experience into portable form. What little changes developers made to the formula make it a better product, and the PSP exclusive bonuses are a huge plus. The game does suffer from a few issues performance and general lack of polish, but otherwise its a totally decent action romp.", "date": "Apr 5, 2006"}
