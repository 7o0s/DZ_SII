In keeping with the company's deal with Konami, and hoping to get a little Olympic gold, Upstart has released Track & Field, the old-school button-mashing game that ruined fingers across the country.   Features:   Classic arcade game  Multiple events   Track & Field, the arcade game, was an instant classic when released in the 1980s. Gamers hovered over the controls, pounding buttons to win races and make huge jumps. Systems were developed involving stick razors, pen caps, and toothbrushes to whammy those buttons with lightning speed.   Upstart's mobile take on Track & Field has none of that. It's probably for the best, though, as not too many people would want to pound the heck out of their handset number pad just to score big on a long jump. Instead, a small bar appears below the action. There's a target mark in the bar. You tap the action key as a moving line passes through the target. Miss and your athlete loses steam. It's a somewhat suitable replacement, but it's just not very Track & Field-esque.   More disappointing, though, is the inclusion of only five events: 100m dash, javelin, long jump, archery, and skeet shooting. Other games have proved you can include more than just a handful of events. Where are hurdles? Shot put?   Track & Field looks more like the NES version of the game, not the arcade rendition. Characters are a little more blocky, colors aren't as crisp. On the Sanyo 8100 we tested the game with, there was even a little flicker. The music seems to be in place, though, which is cool because Track & Field always had a memorable soundtrack.  Track & Field disappoints on several fronts. Visually, it's just not terribly compelling -- even if it is going for that classic look. The arcade game looked better than this, and other track games now certainly look better than the arcade Track & Field. The inclusion of only five events is a let-down, too. After playing such superlative ports from Upstart prior to Track & Field, this half-effort is puzzling.", "date": "Aug 12, 2004"}
