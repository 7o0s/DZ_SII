If you're lucky, the people delivering such fantasy just might realize how stilted it's all becoming after decades of dragons and Hildebrandt maps, and they'll throw in a little humor too. That's the saving grace of Legend of the North: Konung, a Russian import that looks a lot like the Diablo titles.  I have no idea if Russians play Diablo, but it wouldn't surprise me if at least a few pirated copies got into the hands of gamers there and the isometric real-time RPG concept caught on. Like most RPGs, your main character must journey to solve a main quest, but may engage in dozens of side quests on the way. They'll also meet and converse with other characters, gain experience, and continuously improve their skills, weapons, and armor as they find or buy new items. Your main character in the game also starts with a class type, and like the different characters in the Diablo games, each has different strengths.   Legend of the North does sport some important differences. For one, it supports a party system. As your character gains charisma, you can begin to build a party of ten adventurers. Limiting party size by charisma is a great idea. There are other regulators of varying sensibility, with armor use limited by vitality, weapon and shield use by strength, and helmet use by dexterity. There's also a strategic 'hamlet building' element, where you win villages over via your deeds and then get control of their resources. By ordering the construction of new barracks, bringing in trained warriors and builders, and raising defenses, you make the villages stronger, can conscript new fighters for your cause, and collect taxes. Yet, I'm not sure RPG fanatics want to meddle with such things. When I play an RPG, I'm hot to finish quests and go adventuring, not tend to farms.  In some ways Legend of the North is less sophisticated than most RPGs. There's no real spell casting in the game, and the multitude of side quests are almost all courier jobs where you must deliver something to someone. While quest completion order is non-linear, quests are not always optional, and give the game a linear feel. In general, the presentation, though supporting 800x600 resolution, is less attractive and intuitive than Diablo's. And the one feature with the potential to make the game better than Diablo, the party system, is implemented poorly. Combat is too simplistic and the implementation is cumbersome because you have to micromanage the party in real-time. The NPC party members don't know how to rearm a quiver of arrows, even if they have thousands of them in their inventory, and need to be hand-held through almost every maneuver. Legend of the North gives you hotkeys to change weapons quickly, but nothing to quickly drink a healing potion or organize the team into a formation.   It's unfortunate so much doesn't work as smoothly as it should, because Legend of the North's dialogue has some nuggets. The one thing I enjoyed most in Legend of the North were the conversations between characters. The characters range from cynical to silly, and exchanging barbs with the old wise men in the game was more fun than the combat. After completing a quest for one of them, he said, ~At last, I can return to my studies on the unbearable lightness of being. Do you want to hear more about it?~ Your character quickly mutters an excuse to leave and end the conversation. Alas, it's not enough to make it worth getting through this tedious game.  Multiplayer is unfinished as shipped. The install includes an executable you can run to play on a LAN, but not everyone has a LAN. The box claims Internet support, but it's not there. According to the manual, you have to get support files from the ~nearest file hosting site~ and asks you to check the readme file for the site address. The readme file doesn't mention anything about a file site. Thanks guys.  It is true Diablo II had its share of initial multiplayer foibles too, but at least it had outstanding single-player execution. Legend of the North is covered in heavy RPG trappings, but unless you're really bored, chances are you'll find the recent Interplay RPGs more accessible and better designed. Konung is legendary, but for the wrong reasons. At least it can laugh at itself.  -- Bernie Dy      Want to share your opinions with the world?
