But three years into the life of the DS, Nanostray and now its sequel are pretty much the only old-school blasters available on the system.  Perhaps this is because the DS is based around the touch screen, which really doesn't work for the genre.  Indeed, the touch screen controls may have been the greatest drawback to the original Nanostray.  But the sequel chucks the mandatory touching out the window and focuses on solid shoot 'em up gameplay.   Right from the title screen, Nanostray 2's visuals are impressive.  Levels wrap around planets, enemies fly in from the background, and the camera sometimes gives the player a cinematic perspective of the action.  Each stage alternates horizontal and vertical scrolling, so you get a nice variety of action.  Aside from one or two cool bosses, though, the enemy and vehicle design is uninspired.  The cookie cutter machines could have been borrowed from any other shooter.     Gameplay is competent and challenging, but doesn't offer anything new to the genre.  There are eight levels to blast your way through, so the Story mode is of good length.  The game is split in half so players can pick the order of the first four and then the final four stages.  Like most arcade shooters, there aren't any save points, just three continues.  When they're gone you'll have to start back at the beginning of the galaxy.  The difficulty may turn off gamers who aren't big shooter fans, but the hardcore are probably used to it.  Besides, these types of games are meant to be played many times over, and Nanostray 2 is fun.  Each time you play, you'll likely find yourself getting closer and closer to the end boss.   Before each level you can select one of several special attacks.  These are pretty standard fare like a laser, a homing missile, a melee weapon  But you can also set three different firing directions for the helper satellites you pick up early in each stage.  Getting to equip before each level allows you to develop different strategies for each mission.   Where Nanostray 2 goes above and beyond is in the Challenge modes and Simulations.  The challenges are short snippets of action that require you to complete a specific goal.  You may have to earn 45,000 points in 30 seconds, or survive an enemy onslaught for 20 seconds.  Each trial is clever and, while difficult, is very satisfying to survive.   The challenges are split into four groups, and when you've completed a group a Simulation is unlocked.  These are quaint mini-games like Breakout that briefly extend the life of the game.   Nanostray 2 also delivers an above average audio experience.  The music is a mix of orchestral, metal, and techno genres and in general will get your foot tapping.  But the sound effects, including lots of voice acting and stereo explosions, are what will make your headphones happy.If you're a DS-owning shooter fan, Nanostray 2 is a must buy.  Not only is it a perfectly able shmup, it's also the only game in town.  It's not inventive enough to catch the attention of the rest of the world, though.  What it does it does well, but it's all been done before.  Of course, in games, being fun is more important than being new, and Nanostray 2 is definitely fun.  While the visuals are flashy, it's a shame the developers couldn't give the vehicles more character.  The audio department helps to make up for the dull character design, though.  Let's hope Shin'en's next DS shooter won't take another three years.", "date": "Mar 20, 2008"}
