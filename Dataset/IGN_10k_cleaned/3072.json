Now it's got Whacked! to contend with.  Clearly designed with the idea of online play from the get-go, Whacked! fails to be the online funfest Microsoft needs for its infant Live program.  Though Whacked! has potential aplenty, most of it isn't realized.  Slightly bawdy, often comical, occasionally dull, this is a multiplayer game show lacking in true game show presentation.  While Whacked! won't have you jumping off a bridge this holiday, it certainly won't have you running through the streets screaming, ~It's a wonderful life!~  Features  Eight crazy characters to choose from Easy control that can be learned in moments Single player mode lets you unlock a slew of commercials and funny cut scenes Battle up to four friends with split-screen, system link, or through Xbox Live 5.1 Dolby Digital  Gameplay Whacked! is everyone's favorite game show hosted by the magnanimous, spectacular, charismatic Van Tastic.  The host -- more mandible, grin, and hair than anything else -- is offering ~The Prize~, a mysterious, secret gift, to the winner of Whacked!  You'll choose from one of seven contestants (with altered-beast Van Tastic an unlockable eighth) as you make your way through a variety of dog-eat-dog competitions.  Win, and you'll be loving ~The Prize~, lose and you'll be restarting the game!  The problem hits right about here.  See, this is a game show more in the style of something you'd see on Japanese television than anything hosted by Regis or Sajak.  That's fine, because who wants to sit around with a buzzer in their hand answering questions or trying to figure out the difference between a vowel and a consonant?  But, with the exception of a few cut-scenes in single-player mode and an announcer with repetitive phrases, Whacked! misses almost all of that game show presentation.  Though that may not seem important, the lack of presentation hurts both the single-player and multiplayer experience.  For example, in single-player mode (called Gameshow Mode), everything starts off with the air of a game show.  The contestants all stand by podiums, eager to get under way, and host Van Tastic is hamming it up, tantalizing the contestant's and audience with ~The Prize~.  But once you've picked a character, all that disappears.  You'll then have to work through different stages, competing in a variety of games.  Each stage is just an empty set with three doors, nothing spectacular.  Each door holds three different games on various levels.  You have to beat every game in a stage (nine for each stage) to move on, making your choice completely arbitrary.  Doesn't sound bad?  Consider this: There's no Van Tastic standing next to the contestant, taunting them about which door to take.  There's no other contestants making choices either.  It's basically you going through a batch of different games on different levels, beating each one to move on to ~The Prize~.  It's not a game show, then, at all.  It's basically any other type of level-progression game, only this one is held in small arenas where you must defeat three other AI competitors.  From the start, Whacked! is flawed because it goes against its own concept.  Nothing during the games or in-between really has a game show feel.  It's all just window dressing for drawn-out mini-games.  You have to win each game.  There is no second place, no score being kept.  Beat all the games in a stage and move on.  And if you lose a game, all you need do is retry it.  That's something we've seen in video games before, but that's not representative of a game show, even in the loosest of terms.  You do get some solid rewards for playing single-player, though, as each win rewards you with a bizarre commercial or an FMV cut-scene.  The commercials are highly satirical, but not often funny.  Some of them are definite keeps, but many will have you staring blankly at the TV screen.  Oddly enough, the ones that try to make the least sense are the funny ones.  Despite some of the bland commercials mixed in, most of the rewards are good... and there are a lot of 'em.  But getting all these cool scenes is tedious, because the single-player game just isn't much fun.    Let the games begin Battles take place in relatively small arenas (a good thing) that have some minor interactive elements.  These are all well varied and include a bathroom, outer space, the arctic, and the back of a pick-up truck.  The stages are small, because they have to be, but sometimes the level design seems a bit lacking.  There are good ideas (like jumping between moving cars) and then bad ideas (like hopping around the tops of buildings).  Often the environment will kill you or you'll simply fall to your death.  Shouldn't you be more worried about the naked chic with the exploding chicken than about making some jump to another platform?  Yargh, it's enough to bring a tear to this pirate's eye (there's a pirate ship, but it's kind of bland, yargh).  Controls are a breeze as you only need to worry about side stepping (Left Trigger to go left, Right Trigger to step right), jumping (A), and attacking (B).  Though each character has a default attack, those are rather weak.  Most of your damage will be done with one of the many weapons found re-spawning in each level.  There are only six different games, but you get some interesting ones.  There's Fragfest, where the object is to blow away the most opponent's in a certain amount of time, Chicken, in which you have to kill a certain number of chickens to earn stars, and Combat, which requires you to be the first to nab a specific amount of stars.  The problem in single-player is that these contests are far too drawn out.  Some seem to take forever to complete and they're generally not too difficult.  Though on the hardest mode (Whacked), the enemies are much more aggressive, the other modes make them a bit too forgiving.  Most games have ways to both earn towards your goal (collecting stars, for example) and ways to lose those points (getting hit makes you drop stars).  Battles seesaw a lot.  The idea here was that the game would be unpredictable, where someone getting their butt whooped could always climb back into things.  A good idea for online, but it doesn't work in single-player.  Instead, for the single-player mode you end up with games that last too long and become tiresome fast.  Of course, the biggest offense is that most of the games really aren't that much fun unless you are playing against another person.  Whacked! just isn't a good single-player experience.    Contestants, at your buzzer For single-player, you initially begin with four available characters.  By beating the game with a character, another is unlocked.  In the end you'll have eight total to choose from.  Each of these is unique and bizarre.  They all have cosmetic differences, but basically play the same in the game.  So you end up choosing who you play by what they look like and the phrases they pop out during play.  The choice of contestants is what sends this one into the Teen-Rating, because most of the characters are foul-mouthed and in one case, completely nekkid.  Some samplings you'll choose from: Lucky, an ill-tempered rabbit who cusses up a bleep-storm, Lucy who wears only two censor bars over her good and plenties, Charity, a hop-along little girl with teeth that make the British cringe.  Each has their own cut-scenes in the single-player mode, and all come with unique smack talk and cursing barrages.  The characters are certainly there, if only the gameplay and presentation could have supported them, Whacked! could have been a signature Xbox Live game.  Speaking of Xbox Live, every character is already unlocked when you take the full version of Whacked! online, so you can choose from any of the eight characters.  Every weapon and arena is also unlocked.  The only thing Xbox Live leaves for single-player mode are the funny commercials and extra film bits.  You've got to play alone to win those.  Hand me my staple gun No four-player melee game would be complete without a choice selection of weapons, and Whacked! definitely has that.  By picking up weapons around the arenas, you can frag your competitors or deep-fry some chickens, as the case may be.  There's a fantastic amount of weapons and some are truly strange.  You have guns that shoot eggs, beehives sending swarms of bees at opponents, missiles, dogs running around with dynamite clenched between their jowls, staple guns, axes, baseball bats, chicken bombs, and much more.  There are some great weapons here and any skilled contestant will put them to good use.  Along with weapons, each level has hard-to-find red buttons.  These shiny red buttons throw a wildcard into the game.  Press it and everyone may end up with homing missiles or bats in hand.  Or you may change the game momentarily to tag as the leader becomes it and everyone must gang up on them.  Though the red button may be annoying when you're playing the game and it totally screws you over, it's a good thing to have and throws even more unpredictability into the game.    Play with friends Whacked! is meant primarily to be a multiplayer game.  You can go four-player split screen or system link if you don't have Xbox Live (which launches November 15).  Playing with people is absolutely more fun than playing the game alone.  But at least single-player has some game show elements.  In multiplayer, the game is almost completely devoid of all traces of a game show, with the exception of the announcer.  Games simply become a series of different mini-game battles and Whacked! starts looking more like a weak fighter game than anything else.  In multiplayer you have greater control over how the game plays.  You can choose the locale, the type of game, the length of the game, and adjust the goal accordingly.  This is no Halo, but it does prove that any game is more fun when your friends are involved.  Online Whacked! is one of the first Xbox Live games, and the online aspects could hardly be better.  Despite some nagging gameplay problems, the online Whacked! experience is great.  Utilizing all of the standard Xbox Live features, including friends list and the ability to find the best connections to play against with Optimatch, Whacked! is a prime example of what to expect from Xbox Live.    There's no slowdown at all in any of the games I played and it's hard to believe you can be playing someone across the country.  The Voice Communicator is a great asset, especially in Whacked! because a game where you're offing your buddies regularly requires plenty of smack talk on your end.  The voice masking options are limited to less than a dozen, but you'll be able to choose from an unmasked voice (scary), generic, female and male robot voices, raspy, hoarse, cartoon, child, teenage boy and girl, woman, man, and big guy voices..  Though the voice masks are interesting, they're actually kind of annoying (especially the child voice).  Whacked! online is actually more enjoyable than playing with some buddies in person.  The game has a faster pace and since you are playing in a room by yourself, it almost feels like you are going up against really good computer AI (and in some sad cases, really poor AI... sorry Machineshin!).  Xbox Live comes with a demo of Whacked, but not the full version.  So if you want to play all the levels, characters, and weapons, you'll need to shell out the $50.  Had the full title been a pack-in, it would be a solid addition to Xbox Live -- but $50?  A bit too steep, perhaps, for what Whacked! has to offer.  Graphics Don't bother grabbing a napkin, Whacked! isn't going to have you drooling.  But it's a nice-looking game.  Whacked! is like Paul McCartney's grandfather -- very clean, nary a jaggie or aliasing problem in sight.  There are some nice particle effects, good explosions and smoke trails, and there is a lot going on throughout the arena at one time with no slowdown.  The level design is a bit lacking in some places, leading to far too many accidental deaths.  The character designs are varied and absolutely bizarre.  Presto Studios struck gold with Lucy the naked wonder and Lucky the rabbit with an attitude.  There's someone for everyone here, which is exactly what you need when designing a party game.  Sound The sound effects are cartoony, the announcer sounds like he was ripped from the set of a game show, and the characters all feature great voice acting.  The music has a familiarity to it and seems like it's been around for a while despite being original.  It serves the game well, but really isn't a dominating factor in the sound field anyway.  The explosions don't rock the house quite as much as one might want, but it's the VO acting that really shines.  The characters have a variety of phrases for winning, losing, dying, and snagging weapons.  Despite hearing them again and again, most don't get old.  The only knock is the announcer, who only has a few sayings, which you'll hear several times through the course of a single match.  Multiply that by the lifetime of the game... oy.   Whacked! is definitely missing some ingredient, but it's hard to figure out what that is.  Maybe the level-design is too loose or just poorly crafted.  Or maybe the character control could have used a bit more complexity to make it more of a challenge.  More than anything, Whacked! should have made itself more like a game show.  It's one thing if the single-player presentation is weak (after all, it's geared for multiplayer), but to have no real game show setup in the multiplayer is lackluster.  If you're gonna go for a game show theme, you have to stay within that context in some way.  As is, Whacked! becomes a game of tag with rocket launchers.  It can be fun online, but it's really not worth fifty bucks.  But when this baby gets discounted (and it will) look for it.", "date": "Oct 17, 2002"}
