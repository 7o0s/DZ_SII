Adding mummies is Oberon's idea -- and it's a sound one. Bricks of Egypt is a minor evolution of a successful formula -- Breakout with power-ups -- and while the game by no means advances the ball, nobody's losing any ground here either. Players that like this style of game play will be well served by this variation on it.   Bricks of Egypt is a port of the very successful PC casual game, which I tried a demo of to see what -- if anything -- was lost in the translation. Nothing really. The visuals are definitely scaled down -- as are the general dimensions of the playing field -- but everything else seems completely intact, such as the copious amount of power-ups you can use to clear out the screens, like fireballs and a sort of ~glue~ that makes the balls stick to your bat.   The level designs are clever. And while I admittedly have not played all 96(!) of them, the majority of those I have indeed cleared were full of challenges that ramp up quite nicely. The first few basic rounds soon give way to complex set-ups of squares, bricks, glyphs, and cartouches that aren't murderous to complete, but will occasionally take repeat attempts to clear. But I never got frustrated with Bricks to the point of disgust. I just kept plugging away, sliding that bat from left to right, tearing down wall after wall.  Bricks of Egypt is a solid download for fans of the Breakout or Arkanoid school of brick-busting game play. I liked the use of theme quite a bit -- ever-present but not overbearing. With so many stages, there is no shortage of game here for value-minded gamers, as we all should definitely be by now. Recommended.", "date": "Jun 14, 2006"}
