While I've always been a little bit skeptical about the idea of blending arcade action with an RPG, all the early looks we had gotten at Crusaders of Might and Magic made it look as if someone had finally gotten it right. First, the company created a new brand so that RPG purists would know that their favorite series, Might and Magic would be untouched. Next, the company created an engine and a storyline that was designed with action in mind. Finally, they decided to bring in the world and characters that had made their RPGs and strategy titles such a success. New World seemed to have learned from the mistakes of others. After a quick fight with Tal over who was going to review this game, I sat down and got ready for some serious RPG/Action excitement. Fifteen minutes later I realize what a terrible mistake I had made. Crusaders of Might and Magic is simply terrible, a Frankenstein of a game that serves up tepid action gameplay with a watered-down dose of roleplaying with terrible visuals and sound thrown in as an added insult. Let's take a closer look at the game and see if we can't figure out where things went wrong.  Let's start with the storyline. Crusaders of Might and Magic boasts one of the most derivative, predictable plots I've ever come into contact with. You are Drake (love that fantasy name), the sole survivor of a vicious undead attack on a small village. As you have grown up, you have dedicated your life to wiping out these evil marauders from beyond the grave. As the game begins, you are captured and thrown into prison to await execution. From here you must escape and find townspeople who will eventually point you to a powerful sorceress and your true quest  finding a way to stop the undead attacks for good. The entire tale is straight out of Army of Darkness, but without any of the humor or creativity. Worse still, the entire story is frighteningly linear, with towns and mission goals tucked into tight corridors of play area that allow you to choose between going forward or backward and not much else. After only an hour I was bored to tears with the slowly (very slowly) unfolding tale and realized that I was going to have to depend on the game's action elements to keep me entertained. Here's where things got really bad.  If Crusaders of Might and Magic had had a really bad storyline but incredible gameplay, it would have been totally forgivable  after all, it is supposed to be an action title. Sadly, this just isn't the case. Crusaders is at its very best a complete Tomb Raider clone and at its worst, it's just an execise in slamming on the buttons. As you wander around the extremely narrow game world, you come into contact with wave after wave of increasingly big and well-armored dead things. You click your joystick/keyboard buttons and Drake swings his sword/hammer/axe and they die. If you click too soon, you'll miss and they'll hit you first. If you click too late, they'll hit you before you can swing. This sums up everything the game has to offer. This whole timing element would be fine for a boss or two, but it's like this for every single critter you come up against in the game. Once you sort out when you're supposed to be swinging, you have no reason to fear anything. Sadly, if you ever screw up and miss the right time to hit the button, you're usually done for  when the enemy is hitting you, your well-trained warrior stumbles backward unable to return the blow. If you take a shot while there's several enemies around you should get ready to hit the Load button, because there's going to be a beatdown.  But this kind of loss is pretty rare if you've got any sort of playing skill at all. Most of the monsters do pretty well on their initial attack (because the designers put them in a place that's well suited for your approach), but afterwards they are amazingly stupid. After I got bored killing swarm after swarm of foes I began to play around with them and was able to get them to fall off cliffs and drop into lava simply by leading them a little bit. I tried to tell myself that only the beginning enemies would be this dumb, but as I got further and further into the game, I realized that the bigger and badder monsters were, if anything, even dumber.  The so-called RPG element doesn't really add anything at all to this mind-numbing play experience. Basically Crusaders considers itself to be an RPG for three reasons. First, it has an inventory system that lets you switch weapons and use potions to heal yourself. Sadly, even the fact that you can use different weapons is ruined  all of the weapons deliver very, very similar play effects and work in much the same way. The only real difference is that some do more damage (and are usually very slow) and some are very quick (and usually do less damage). The end difference in the game is negligible. Crusaders next big RPG element is its experience point system. As you play you gain experience that helps Drake grow and change. Of course, you don't have any control over that growing and changing, so this is, once again, no different from any number of arcade games that give their main characters new powers as the game wears on. Since there's a mandatory path to anywhere you need to go, and since every enemy you meet immediately runs at you to attack, the designers know exactly how much experience you'll have at any given point. Finally, Crusaders considers itself an RPG simply because it takes place in a fantasy universe. Sure, you'll get spells and talk to villagers, but since the entire game is built on an action engine, these things usually end up annoying you more than they make you feel like you're being immersed in another world.  Before I close the coffin lid on this dog of a game, I feel like I should, in full fairness admit that the game did feature some pretty amazing in game animation. No matter which system we loaded the game up on, it played quickly and smoothly, with no frame drops or jerky animations. While the visuals themselves weren't all that inspired, at least they moved well, which is a real trick when you're dealing with a free camera. Sound was another mixed bag. The game's soundtrack was excellent with loads of movie quality (or at least television quality) themes, but the sound effects were pretty lame and the speech was the worst I've ever heard in the game. Every NPC you run into sounds like some guy off the street reading a cue card. Worse still, the sound quality on these recordings is abysmal, so the suspension of disbelief takes an even heavier blow.  Crusaders of Might and Magic is a bad game. While it's engine does run smoothly, there is absolutely nothing else about this game that makes it worth picking up. If you're a fan of the Might and Magic series, please, please, please stay away from this awful misuse of the license. By the time the next title in the RPG line comes out I'm hoping I can forget this game ever existed. In the meantime, you can bet that I won't be grabbing any more titles off Tal's desk.  -- Trent C.
