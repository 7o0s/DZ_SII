You're an action hero in an alternate history setting. The Tsar of Russia is murdered just before the Revolution. His son Pietre steps in and turns Russia into a mighty war machine. The Revolution never occurs and Russian forces begin the conquest of Europe in the 1920s. Your job, as a commando in the Shadow Command, is to operate behind enemy lines to stop the Russian juggernaut. You do this basically by running around killing folks and blowing up stuff that belongs to them. But while it's certainly a great deal of fun, Codename Eagle winds up falling far short of the mark in a few key areas.  In terms of concept, this game is as solid as any and in the end may have even been a little overly ambitious. The idea of having a cinematic action game where you can run around on foot, drive tanks and fly planes necessarily involves some compromises in the area of physics and control. This is the first real issue you'll have with the game. The engine that powers the normally planar world of most shooters is ill suited to handle movement in the third plane. This isn't much of a problem in basic flight, but just try engaging in a dogfight sometime. While you can eventually get used to the idiosyncrasies of the flight modeling (and the rest of the vehicular models to a lesser extent), there's a steep learning curve here.  The graphics in this game are a real mixed bag as well. I thought that the sky textures were fantastic. Sunsets, clouds and a brilliant haze effect are gorgeous. And the textures on the characters and vehicles are equally well done. Some of the ships are particularly amazing. Unfortunately, there are some severe clipping problems with textures jumping in front of each other like fat kids in a cafeteria. The character and vehicle models are, with a few notable exceptions, fairly blocky. Some of the objects in the game don't behave as you'd expect them to. While it's a nice touch to be able to knock down trees while driving in an armored car, the fact that the uprooted trees pull a fade job. Remember the Mystics from the Dark Crystal? And the chicken-wire fences are impenetrable to bullets...and the vision of enemy guards as well. And while we're on the subject, how is it that Mr. Big Shot Commando can't even throw a grenade over a lousy fence? Ugh...  The twelve missions are handled very well overall and offer a range of objectives and gameplay opportunities. In one mission, you'll have to gain entrance to a church and snipe an officer as he drives by in his motorcar. In another mission, you'll have to take off from an aircraft carrier and bomb a bridge, sink two battleships and land safely. Another mission has you blowing up anti-aircraft guns to pave the way for your own forces to bomb an enemy base...and you have to rescue a scientist from the base while you're at it. The missions are presented in a very easy to understand format and an in-game map highlights your objectives and any potential obstacle that you might have to overcome. The 3D mission map briefings will also spell out your objectives so there's no confusion.  Sadly, the cutscenes and story that tie the missions together are pretty poor in terms of quality. Between missions you'll be treated to some pretty sad looking static snapshots and some dialogue. It goes a long way to making you not care about what's going on. While this wouldn't have been a crippling limitation, the game aggravates the situation by trying to drive too much story through these cutscenes. Some of them go on for quite a long time, prompting me eventually to abandon the idea of following the story altogether. They don't call it the ~escape key~ for no reason.   The variety of mission objectives is refreshing but the awkwardness of the vehicle controls tends to get in the way of your enjoyment. I've never been one to fly with the keyboard (although after playing this game, I'm much better at it). The physics are very relaxed allowing you skip your plane along the surface of a hill or pull a very soft and bouncy landing on a carrier deck. It fits in with the cinematic feel of the game, but it involves more of a suspension of disbelief than I was willing to offer...especially given that the narrative elements of the story were so weak.  After working through most of the single player missions, we decided to give the multiplayer modes of play a real workout. There are basically three types of play here -- deathmatch, team deatmatch and capture the flag. The five maps are relatively huge (making games of less than 6 players a little dull) but are quite well designed. The inclusion of several weapon types and hordes of vehicles lets you cut loose on your enemies in any way you can imagine.  To give you one example, Dan and I squared off on one of the larger maps. I immediately jumped into the seat of a nearby plane and taxied out onto the runway. Dan chased me firing off several shots with his machine gun. I took to the air without too much damage and pulled around to bring my plane's guns right in line with Dan's wimpy virtual body. But Dan had run up to the anti-aircraft gun and was busy filling my plane with lead. I flew over his head and dropped some bombs on the gun. Dan ran out of the way and began running for cover. I tried to strafe him and decided eventually to crash my plane right into Dan. It killed us both, but was well worth it.  So when it comes right down to it, I love this game but it's got some serious failings. The graphics aren't that stable and the story is kind of...well, unimportant. But the opportunity to switch from running around and shooting stuff to hopping into motorcycles, torpedo boats or Russian bombers is well worth your time. It took me a while to get used to the controls, but once I did, it was a lot of fun. The game has some very well designed missions and perfectly captures the whole cinematic, war movie feel. It's like your very own Great Escape.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Apr 7, 2000"}
