Huge quests with epic, captivating storylines and unchallenged character development -- these are the details that set Hudson's series apart from the pack.  Wait a minute -- what the hell are we talking about? In reality, the Bomberman titles are well liked by gamers because of their simplistic, but wonderfully addictive multiplayer modes. Everyone knows that! Well, everyone except for maybe Hudson, which continues to deliver Nintendo 64 owners platformer takes on the Bomberman franchise. All of these 64-bit exclusives seem to share one aspect in common -- afterthought multiplayer modes that fail to realize the intuitive design and speed that made Bomberman a hit to begin with.   Bomberman 64: The Second Attack, the developer's latest offering, serves up a mediocre new single-player story and various multiplayer modes, and it's all mildly entertaining for a short while. But old-school Bomberman fanatics are likely to wonder why Hudson can't duplicate the intense multiplayer action featured in the Super-NES and Saturn predecessors, and newcomers looking for a decent platformer will definitely be underwhelmed by the first-generation look and mechanics of this supposed 64-bit title.   Feautures First-generation 3D engine allows for ~polygons~ Single-player storyline complete with sidekick Pommy Various multiplayer modes including four-player simultaneous battle Two-player cooperative action Rumble Pak support Controller Pak compatible   Note: Because Bomberman 64: The Second Attack is virtually unchanged from the Japanese import Bomberman 64 2, we've decided to repost Japanese freelancer Tim Horst's review of the game with new inserts from editor-in-chief Matt Casamassina. The inserts will be highlighted with italics.  Storyline and Gameplay The story is as follows. The evil Rukifellth has taken one of the eight elementals that exist in the universe from the Planet Kaos and formed the B.H.B. gang. (B.H.B. stands for Black Hole Bang). Searching for the other seven Elementals in the giant space ship Noah, he and the B.H.B. began invading and taking over the other planets. The next planet on their list is Planet Bomber. Enter a weary Bomberman, fresh off of defeating the evil Artile, heading for his home of Planet Bomber after a refreshing stop at the hot spring planet, Ksa2. However, Bomberman's ship is caught in a black hole created by the Noah. The only way out is to take out the B.H.B.'s gravity control devices located on each planet and finally, with your newfound friend, Pommy, take out Rukifellth himself.  Bomberman for One Let's start with the single player mode. In the original Bomberman 64, there were 3D worlds complete with different camera angles and the ability to rotate the camera around. While the worlds were not as big as say, Super Mario 64, they required you to use your bombs in interesting ways like bridges or stairs, etc. Bomberman 64 2 keeps the use of bombs intact, but the worlds have a much different feel to them. Whereas in the original, you could move around and the camera would follow you, this time there is no moving camera. Nor is there any way to adjust the view of the action. But a good camera system isn't really necessary because while the game is in 3D, the world isn't ~connected~ in 3D. The best way to explain it is to imagine a bunch of 3D screens connected to each other. You enter a screen through a door, clear out all the enemies and the door to the next screen opens. Some screens are about the size of your TV screen. Those that are a little bigger simply scroll along as you move and then stop when you get to the end. Even in worlds that take place outside, there are these ~doors~ between screens. There is no seamless flow from one area to the next. In this sense, it feels more like 2.5D. I found this rather disappointing, as I preferred the setup of the original.   It's important to note that Bomberman: Second Attack's engine is entirely ~first-generation~ in nature. The 3D environments that it displays are decidedly low-poly, blurry, barren, and unimpressive, and yet the game still has its share of slowdown -- especially in the multiplayer modes. The end result is a look that leaves the player very underwhelmed regardless of the purposeful simplistic style of the game. -- Matt  The objectives are basically the same for each world.   1. Take out the enemies  2. Collect items left behind from enemies or boxes (includes powerups, food for Pommy, money)  3. Solve/watch out for puzzles and traps in order to advance  4. Defeat the member of the Seven Elemental Knights (boss and BHB member)  5. Destroy the gravity control machine at the end of each level   The worlds in this game are very easy. I mean very, very easy. None of the puzzles or use of bombs are particularly clever or new. There is the ~push the four blocks over the four switches to open the door~ which feels straight out of Zelda. And of course there is the dropping of a bomb in a crack to use it as a bridge or jumping pad, which is at least original. Many of the enemies don't even notice that you are there. You can simply walk in front of them and they won't do a thing. Some enemies will actually charge you if they see you, but even they aren't very bright. In addition to being incredibly easy, the levels are extremely short. I played for five minutes and I arrived at the boss of Level 1. Granted the boss was actually kind of hard at first, but definitely beatable after a few tries. Another 5-10 minutes after the boss and you're at the gravity control machine room. This room has about four regular enemies in it, and if you blow them up, nobody takes their place and you can operate in peace. Not exactly tense. There are basically four energy posts that you have to destroy in the room in order to remove the shield surrounding the machine. Once the shield is down, a couple of bombs and you're done. That's it. 15 minutes and you're done with the first level and there are only seven of them.   The next few levels were a little longer and marginally harder, but still too short and easy. And most of that extra length was due to the fact that once you hit that switch, a door back in a room at the beginning opens. You find yourself running back and forth between the same rooms a lot. After Level 1, the path branches off towards two planets. You may choose which one you will go to next, but it doesn't really matter, because you will have to clear the third one before anymore open up. The only difference is what new bombs (elemental) you will get next. I guess Hudson decided to make the difficulty come from the fact that you must start over each time you die. The game only saves itself after you defeat the boss and after you blow up the machine. This is more irritating that anything else, especially if you slip up against the boss or accidentally blow yourself up somewhere. Also annoying is the fact that you can't skip through the cut scenes and they replay themselves if you die and have to start over.  There are two new features to the single player mode. One is your sidekick Pommy and the other is the Guardian Suit system. Pommy is a little Pokemon-looking guy who hatches from an egg that you found on Ksa2. He follows you around the worlds, but conveniently hides during the boss and gravity machine battles. Not that he would be much help anyway. His only really useful function that I have noticed is that he occasionally stuns enemies so you can bomb them without them moving. There is the option of Pommy being controlled by a second player, but it doesn't seem too interesting to me, given Pommy's limited abilities. Apparently, Pommy has the ability to evolve by eating food that appears after you blow stuff up, but the computer controlled Pommy would never go get the food, forcing me to control him and pick up food, which never evolved him either. I suppose I didn't pick up enough. Fruits/vegetables are supposed to make him smarter, while meats are supposed to make him stronger. The manual didn't say what  the sweets make him do.   The only other features to mention in the single player mode are the different bombs (fire, ice, hurricane, lighting and napalm) and money. Like the first game, you will have to decide what bombs to use in what situations, or a combination of bombs (ex. freeze a fountain with an ice bomb, then blow it up with a fire.) You collect money and may use it at the Shop that is on the World Select screen. You may choose from three categories: parts (for Custom Bomber [see Multiplayer]), hints regarding traps/puzzles/bosses, and items (such as extra heart containers) or battle maps for mulitplayer.  Multiplayer Action If you're talking about Bomberman, you have to mention the multiplayer mode. That is what the game is all about. Luckily, this is where Bomberman 64 2 shines -- at least, for the most part. There are a total of five different multiplayer modes (not counting the two-player ~co-op~). Survival is your regular elimination bout. Battle Royal is determined by who scores the most points in a given time limit. You score 10 points for a kill and lose five points for being killed. King & Knights consists of teams trying to protect their king while taking out the opponent's king. You can pick up your king and carry him around to protect him from enemy fire if you are playing by yourself. Key Trial hides three keys in a given level and the first player to collect two of them wins. This is one of the modes that is four-player split-screen. The last mode is Score Attack. In this mode, you must collect items that appear after you blow up things like pigs, fish, trees, etc. that appear on screen. Things like powerups and coins will give you points, and the person with the most points at the end of the time limit is the winner. This is also a four-player split screen. The battle modes are locked at first and you must challenge the computer in order to unlock them. There are five levels to a challenge. After winning the first three, you unlock the next mode. After each win, you unlock extra computer characters. Any human controlled player has to use a different colored Bomberman.   A Second opinion: While Tim was impressed with Second Attack's multiplayer mode, I believe it a falls short in nearly every measure. Perhaps the greatest aspect of the Super-NES and Saturn Bomberman titles were the fast, intuitively designed multiplayer modes that enabled players to trap opponents between bombs and against blocks in maze-like environments. Oddly, almost all of the multiplayer arenas in Second Attack stray from that formula to the point where several of them take place in wide-open areas. In the end, we have three or four bombers running around a circular or square environment randomly laying explosives with no real plan or thought.   Hudson has come up with some good ideas like the Battle Royal mode in which players compete under a time limit to out-bomb each other -- the person with the most successful kills when the meter is up is the winner. But again, all of this transpires in lacking environments and with some annoying slow-down -- especially where the split-screen stuff is concerned. Exactly why there is any slow-down in Bomberman: Second Attack at all is the biggest puzzle the game has to offer. -- Matt  The Custom Bomber mode allows you to use parts you bought in the shop to customize Bomberman and use him in the Battle Mode. For example, you can give him a tank for a body, or swords for hands, fake mustaches, all kinds of stuff. I haven't been able to use him in a Battle Mode game yet. I am thinking that it must be something you have to unlock in order to use. There are a total of 22 multiplayer screens, but some of them maybe only used in certain modes. Also, some of them must be bought through the Shop in the Story Mode in order to be used. They were fairly cheap though. That's one thing I liked about the game was that so much of it has to be unlocked. Even in the Option Menu, there are two mystery options that I can't access yet.   In a throwback to the Bomberman days Super NES, you are unable to kick or throw bombs without first finding and picking up the respective item. For those who enjoyed the pick up and play mechanics of Bomberman 64, this really takes is quite a big change. However, since Bomberman Super NES is still considered one of the greatest multiplayer games of all time, Hudson did right to take the old route -- and while it slows the pace of the game down a bit, it still works. It can be frustrating after dying, though, as you lose all of your powerups and have to start over from scratch.   The game's biggest problem is its sense of fluidity. I'm no framerate tart, but this game does slow down in the four-player mode, especially the split screen maps. If that weren't bad enough, Bomberman's regular foot speed is quite slow, without the use of special boots (three levels) that allow him to go a little faster. At least in the multiplayer mode, I would have liked to see this issue addressed. It would have made for much faster and smoother battles.  All in all, this game looks and feels like the Bomberman 64 before it with an expanded multiplayer mode that pays homage to the classic Bomberman of old. The hidden stuff to be found and unlocked is way cool, but the length and difficulty of the one player mode is suspect. Plus, the game doesn't really feel like 3D. Also, the Seven Elemental Knights are all basically the same. Where is that cool dragon boss that was in the first game? Or the giant fish? These guys all look and fight a lot alike. On the multiplayer side, the new modes and huge variety of maps, computer characters and Custom Bomber add greatly to what the first game was lacking. But it feels slower and having to search for the kick item, while great for those who enjoyed the original Bomberman for Super NES, may deter those who liked the fast and easy mechanics of Bomberman 64. In the end, this is Bomberman 64 with an improved multiplayer mode. Don't expect anything new with the title, especially as far as graphics go. Still, if you're a Bomberman fanatic and must relive the multiplayer days of old, this is the best route to take for your Nintendo 64.", "date": "Jun 8, 2000"}
