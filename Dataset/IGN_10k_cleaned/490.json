MBL Research, the team behind the splendid NHL '99 was hard at work this past year putting together Supercross 2000. While this is no place to discuss the merits of a potentially great hockey sequel versus a never-seen-before-now motorbike racing game, we can tell you that MBL Research has got their stuff together when it comes to making great looking, great playing N64 sims. Supercross 2000 may turn off a few console owners because of its extremely sim-based control system, but this is only because it's so well done. This is one of the few EA Sports games for the N64 this year that's actually better than the PSX version because it uses the N64's awesome graphics capabilities to the max.   The Features:  Authentic factory bikes like the Honda CRs, Kawasaki KX, Yamaha YZ and Suzuki RM. 25 of the best Supercross and Freestyle riders including Mike Metzger and Greg Albertyn. Picture-in-picture stunt camera shows close-ups of midair acrobatics in the middle of stunt jumps. Play-by-play announcing from David Bailey. Advanced motorcycle physics models.  Stunt jumps include heel-clickers, nac-nacs, pancakes and the fender grabs. Three dedicated stunt arenas. Season, Career and Freestyle stunt mode. Tracks wear down and change as a race progresses, developing grooves and ruts. Split-screen two-player racing. Expansion Pak support for true hi-res graphics. Rumble Pak compatible   Gameplay If you don't know much about motorbike racing, then S2000 can be a little intimidating when you first pick it up. The physics of the game are excellent and are such that after a few hours of playing you will know enough about racing motorbikes to enjoy everything Supercross 2000 has to offer.  The Season, Quick Race and Single Race put you on one of the 16 genuine stadium tracks in the game to race against the 25 pro riders featured in the game. It is in these races that you discover there's more to this game than just hitting the accelerator and steering your way around the courses. Marvelous bike-rider-track physics mean that you'll have to learn when to accelerate, brake, lean forward, lean back and engage the clutch with perfect timing to succeed in S2000. This is no easy task for beginners, but the convenient Practice mode is a very useful aid. There are also different difficulty settings that prevent you from accidentally leaving the track (the invisible walls are switched off on the higher difficulties) and offer lean assist and varying speed settings.  Negotiating turns is what all the racing modes boil down to. Anyone familiar with racing sims knows that you have to reduce your speed as you come into a 90 degree or hairpin turn. In S2000 you'll have to learn to accept the fact that you're going to darn near stop when you make tight turns. This is a tough fact to evaluate because on the one hand you want to believe that it's intentional and indicative of real motorbike racing since all of the other riders have to slow down as well. You're getting the real deal. On the other hand, you realize that this is a videogame and you shouldn't have to worry about your puny little motorcycle man's strange little world of physics so much. You're playing it to have fun and beat the competition.    The turns are manageable and you will be able to figure out the proper gas-clutch-turn sequence, but this will definitely take some time to master and those with short attention spans may not have the patience.   After much soul-searching we've come to the conclusion that while it would've been more fun with easier, quicker and more arcade-like sliding turns, Supercross is staying true to its sim nature with the cumbersome turning mechanics and it's still very well done and accurate. It makes for a much more interactive 3D racing experience. You have to be concerned with and in control of your rider's position (leaning forward or backward), the bike's angle in relation to the track (leaning left or right) and the standard racing variables like speed and handling because they're all working together at the same time throughout the race. The only freebie you're given in Supercross is balance. There's a lot of physics to keep track of so the least they could do is make sure your guy stays on his bike.   If you want to do some mindless riding in this game, then the superfun Freestyle modes are about as close as you're going to get. The three dedicated stunt tracks provide plenty of runway space, ramps and bowls to launch your bike into the air. Once there, you've got all kinds of tricks to pull off. We've been able to do about nine, but there are definitely more. The picture in picture display will show a nice real time shot of your guy kicking, leaning or reaching his way through tricks so you can catch the difference between a nac-nac and a can-can.  The game engine doesn't change in the Freestyle modes, so you still have the same bike physics and all, but there's so much space that you can take big wide radius turns to set up your jump runs. This also means that to pull off tricks properly you have to build up enough speed, catch enough air and finish showing off in time to make a smooth landing or... you'll crash.   Dust off your old Street Fighter moves because the variety of tricks in the game require all kinds of half and quarter circles on the analog stick in conjunction with the C-down button. Timing is important in the Freestyle modes in that you only have a few seconds to initiate a trick, hold it long enough to get those cool bonus points and still have time to land safely. Some of the more complicate tricks like the almighty Fender Grab Superman have more animation so you have to start hitting C-down and moving the stick as soon as your wheels leave the ground. You get bonus points for holding tricks for a long time and for catching ~big air~ when you do it. The stunt modes are extremely fun and definitely the most exciting part of the game. You'd be amazed at how you'll go from pulling off 10 point no-handers when you first start playing to pulling off 165 point Cordovas with bonus Stylie and Big Air points. Very exciting  Graphics This game looks great. In fact, it looks so good that the default setting is medium resolution even though the high-res mode (640x480), especially in the stunt modes, look awesome. The slight dip in framerate when you flip it to high-res (an Expansion Pak only feature) must have been enough to persuade the game's creators to opt for medium resolution. A little anal retentiveness that works to our advantage. We highly recommend using the high resolution mode when you're running the single player Freestyle mode, and scoff at your PSX-loving buddies when you do so because there's simply no comparison. In the racing modes, hi-res causes the game to chop up slightly, but it will only be annoying because you'll know the medium resolution mode looks damn good and is a lot smoother so there's no need to sacrifice.  The riders and bikes are extremely detailed and the animations are nearly perfect. The riders have that sharp angled abstract look that's been common in many EA Sports titles this fall, but it really doesn't matter in this game because they move so well. The bikes themselves are detailed right down to the spokes in the wheels. The game's biggest accomplishment is the rider animation. It is exactly what you want from this type of game.  We actually learned what a perfectly executed nac-nac looks like because of this game. The tricks the guys pull off are all distinct and clear enough that you won't confuse any of them. The game has some minor clipping problems, but they're limited to the bike and the surrounding environment However, when a rider reaches for his back fender to do that Fender Grab Super, you'll see arms and legs move around handlebars and seat to execute the trick flawlessly. On tricks like pancakes and the superman, the bike moves perfectly in relation to the rider and according to mid-air physics. Beautifully done.  There are only a handful of ugly visuals in Supercross 2000. The bike clips into ramps and walls and such especially at high speeds and when you approach them at weird angles. Also the crash animations, which could've been a lot worse, don't really live up to the standards set by other animations in the game. The guys flip and bounce and roll and tuck, but not as smoothly as other elements of the game.   Sound The music and announcing are superior. The crashing sounds aren't as dramatic as we'd like though. There are several rock bands featured in the game, including MxPx and The Living End. If you like the bands or the style of music, you'll be pleased. If you don't like the bands or the music, you'll quickly learn when to turn the volume down and for how long. Music is confined to the menus by default, unless you manually switch it on for the races.  David Bailey's announcing is limited, but good for the most part although he can get behind at times. If you have a heated battle for first place and two guys quickly change position three or four times, he'll catch the first time somebody gets overtaken but he'll either stay one move behind after that or simply give up. After there's an established leader, he'll give reminders, but he usually starts focusing on heated battles for position back in the pack. His announcing is a great way to know what's going on elsewhere on the track, since he gives updates on crashes too.   The engine sounds are dynamic and fairly accurate, except for the high pitches. At the beginning of a race you'll hear all of the racers gunning and revving as they come out of the gate. You'll hear the multiple engine noises as long as there are some around to hear. When you're all alone, all you get is your bike's noise.   The crashes, even when you're by yourself on the freestyle tracks aren't nearly as loud or disturbing as we'd like them to be. In real motorbike racing, the crashes usually sound pretty gruesome. They're toned down in this game and we imagine it has something to do with EA Sports' sponsorship of a pro circuit.  A straight up sim game with a nice stunt mode is not a bad way to go for the N64's first motorbike racer. It's well done and even though supercross is still on the periphery of my sports radar, I enjoyed learning what this game had to teach. This is another game, like World Driver Championship, where watching replays is going to be a huge part of the game's appeal, especially in the stunt modes. While a little more arcade fun would've been nice, there's nothing wrong with this sim. We're not sure where it'll stand once the huge backlog of motorbike racing games due out finally make it to stores, but Supercross 2000 is certainly going to be one of the top motorcycle sims on the N64.", "date": "Dec 4, 1999"}
