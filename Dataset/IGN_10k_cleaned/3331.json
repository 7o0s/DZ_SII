You go fast, you go ruthless, and you go all out.  Here's the catch.  Race too fast and you'll actually get so excited, so pumped, you'll have a heart attack.  That's right -- race too fast and you have a heart attack.  This is the grand concept behind Pulse Racer, easily one of the worst racers on the market.    Features Nine cars, ten characters, fifteen tracks INFINITRAX system randomly generates tracks Up to four people can race it out on split-screen No custom soundtracks Stereo sound  Gameplay Jaleco should, first, get a small pat on the back for trying to do something new with a cart racer.  Problem is, before you start doing new concepts, you have to make sure that the basics work properly and are fun.  Then you have to make certain the new additions to the formula don't ruin what makes racers fun in the first place.  Pulse Racer screws both these up.  First, it really doesn't do cart racing any justice to begin with.  It never hits on the essential needs of a cart racer (fun, interesting tracks, cars and characters, and great multiplayer action) and the additions make it even worse and, in fact, almost unplayable.  The controls for Pulse Racer are a bit different from the norm.  A accelerates, B brakes, and X uses your current power-up.  The left and right triggers shoot beams to either side that can attach to orbs on the edges of tracks.  This allows you to swing through turns without losing speed.  Squeeze both triggers to bring up a shield, which protects you but prevents you from steering.  The left thumbstick not only steers your cute little car, but pressing forward offers a dramatic speed boost and pulling back offers a far less dramatic turbo.    You'd think all you have to do to nail a good race is push up for a constant speed boost and hold down the accelerator.  Wrong-o buddy.  Because in Pulse Racer drivers can have heart attacks.  Keep the speed boost on too long and your heart rate will increase, the controller will vibrate in rhythm with the pounding of your chest, and if you don't ease up, you'll flatline.  Your driver then slumps over for a few seconds until adrenaline is shot into his heart and he can start up again.    The idea, apparently, is that you need to go as fast as possible, but have to also think of managing your speed so you don't keel over.  This goes against what a racer should be -- driving fast and being fun.  Instead, it's like your mom always told you, ~Don't drive so fast, you'll have a heart attack!~  Okay, my mom never said that either.  Probably because it's quite a stupid idea and to be honest it's a wonder how anyone approved this concept to begin with.  Go fast, but not too fast!  Click this pic to watch a guy have a heart attack.  The real problem, though, is that while you try and keep from flatlining, the other racers are zipping off.  Good luck trying to win every race, because often times it feels like you've lost the moment you hit the accelerator.  Pulse Racer is an unbalanced and unfair single-player experience.  Whether it's career mode (which has you competing in various leagues to be number one) or in the single player time trials or quick races.  The one nice thing is that in career mode you must face a separate boss to finish off each of the three leagues.  Beat the boss and you unlock them.  That's one nice thing, but I really doubt anyone will have the patience to see this game through that far.  As with most other cart racers, power-ups appear on the track.  Shield, speed boost, health, missiles, and mines are all there.  There's nothing new to the power-ups library and anyone who's ever played a cart racer will be familiar with how each is used and likely be able to use all of them effectively.  The fifteen tracks available are generic and only offer a few of different visual themes, but the real money is with the INFINITRAX system.  Granted, I'm always wary of any system that needs to be in all-caps, but the INFINITRAX system does a good job of randomly generating tracks.  Progressing through career mode (if you dare) earns you points you can spend to unlock different track customizations.  Choose the location of the track (its theme), how curvy, wide, and far it is as well as how many hills and dips there are.  The tracks take about a minute to generate and must be saved (don't sweat it, it's only five blocks) before you can use them.  I'm not sure, though, if the generator is really good or if the pre-made tracks are really generic, because they look like they could be easily interchanged.  The main problem is that you often get bits of track that make no sense, like sometimes you'll get ten yards of track that opens up wide and then bottlenecks again.  INFINITRAX keeps the game fresh.  But trust me, you won't be playing that long to require freshness.  Multiplayer is decent, but it's only split-screen.  No online and no system link makes this about as barebones as it gets.  But considering the overall presentation (not really any to begin with) and the weak gameplay, it's not surprising to see little care given to one of the most important aspects of cart racing.  If you can't play and enjoy with your friends, the developers didn't do their job.    Graphics I'll say this for Pulse Racer, it's void of jaggies and aliasing problems.  It looks clean and there are some decent lighting effects, but that's where the praise ends.  The cars are weak.  Though futuristic, these cars look like second-hand toys you buy at a swap meet.  There are nine total and none of them are particularly distinct from the other.  Sure, you can change the skins to a few different colors, but it's a weak, weak showing.  And the characters, while all different in appearance, lack any personality whatsoever.  The cars, the tracks, the characters -- none of them have personality.  The game's essence is as plastic as its cars appear to be.  Add to this some framerate hiccups for bad measure and you've got yourself a rather uninspired visual show.  Sound Pulse Racer offers a good handful of forgettable tracks, but no custom soundtracks.  No racing title should be without custom soundtracks, especially one made specifically for the Xbox.  Use the hardware!  Speaking of which, there's no Dolby Digital support either.  Just the beauty of stereo.  Some weak sound effects round things out.  A meager effort at best. Forget about Pulse Racer, it's not a good game.  It's an example of a very, very poor game.  It's the kind of thing that was often slopped off on the PlayStation (you know what I'm talking about).  It's a shame to see Microsoft is giving thumbs up to games so clearly flawed from concept to finish.  Race fast enough to win, but not so fast your heart stops??  Remember when the primary function of a game was to be fun?  Even for $30, this stinker isn't worth a look.  Not even worth a rental.  Run now, while you have the chance!", "date": "Dec 13, 2002"}
