That's the question that Midway posed to arcade goers 25 years ago when it unleashed Joust, a classic battle of the birds that took 1982 pizza parlors by storm. Uncomplicated in every sense of the word, Joust's simplicity is actually what makes it fun. Just tap a button to fly around a single screen and knock competing knights off their buzzards.   Yes, that's all there is to it but what's surprising is, that even in today's world of realistic graphics and super-complex gameplay mechanics, the ~highest lance wins~ philosophy still works. Don't get me wrong, the PS3 version of Joust isn't going to win any accolades for its depth or originality, but there is something to be said for just pressing start and doing your thing...even if you've played that thing a million times before.   Is nostalgia always better than reality, or is Joust an exception? Like the Xbox 360 port released in 2005, Joust has a couple of current-gen bells and whistles that accentuate its minimalism. Leaderboards, two-player online support, and an HD resolution chime in here just as they did in Sony's other Midway classics, but that means they have the same problems too (no voice chat during online play, the upgraded visuals don't really enhance the experience, etc). The good news is that Joust is played so easily and quickly that the shortcomings don't hurt it as badly as they do in other PSN titles. It's still disappointing to see those standard features left out, sure, but it's livable.   Naturally, the ultimate question is, ~Is Joust worth five bucks if I already have it?~ If you've already picked it up in an existing compilation disc or have the 360 version, then the answer is ~No~. On its own, Joust's online play isn't enough to warrant getting the game all over again and the Xbox edition has a number of extras that this one doesn't (namely redrawn graphics and new backgrounds).   If those two scenarios don't apply to you, however, then Joust is a passable trip down memory lane. Nailing pointy birds and collecting eggs before they respawn makes for one of the friendliest pick up and play games you'll find on the PS Network so far. It also shows off what we old folk used to do for fun back in the Dark Ages.Joust is a quarter-century old now and, while it isn't going to hold your attention forever, it's handy as an occasional five to 10-minute supplement inbetween meatier gaming sessions. It is what it is, nothing more and nothing less.", "date": "May 30, 2007"}
