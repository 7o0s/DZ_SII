{"name": "Serenity", "name_review": "Serenity: Renegades", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/10/25/serenity-renegades", "text": "The fact that Serenity: Renegades has subtitle leads me to assume Indiagames has more than one game in the works based on the movie follow-up to Joss Whedon's cancelled sci-fi television series. Judging from the underwhelming returns on the movie, maybe there aren't as many ~Firefly~ fans as one originally thought. However, Indiagames' little shooter should find a decent sized fan-base, as it provides some solid top-down shmup sessions.   Serenity: Renegades starts off with some story scenes of little consequence. What matters is what follows. The screen slowly fills up with alien craft hell-bent on sending the Serenity to that great scrap yard in the sky. Wave after wave of minorly detailed craft pop into view, belching some easily dodged bullets in your direction. Enjoy these easy dogfights while they last, because over time, Serenity: Renegades ratchets up the difficulty.   Making this galaxy quest a little easier are weapon power-ups, which are blasted into your possession by taking out specific craft. You can get plasma cannons, homing missiles, and other staples of the shooter genre. Blasting ships also unleash coins, which can be spent in between-round shops. The inventory is full of extra goodies to help your cause, such as orbiting satellites that will absorb shots and smash alien fighters that get too close. There are useful shields, as well as extra ships, to keep you in the fight for much longer.   If you save up your coins from the first few levels, you can really splurge and get a souped-up Serenity. A shield and two satellites really make you a force to be reckoned with -- and actually tilts the game too much in your favor. As soon as I pimped my ship, I felt somewhat invincible. The satellites were volleying shots, too, so I had a fairly wide spread of fire across a narrow field of view.   There are also end-round boss fights against ships that have predictable patterns and weak spots, as well as mini-missions where you must guide Serenity through a small maze. These little mini-missions are kinda frustrating because they have different controls that the main game. Pressing up moves your ship forward, while left and right rotate the thing. There are lasers and other stuff that can blast your ship into smithereens -- but get this, you then lose all of your firepower, even though you aren't using it during these sequences. That feels cheap to me.   Serenity: Renegades is flanked by some really good mobile music, with a different tune for each of the game's several levels. Some are better than others, but honestly, none will have you digging for the volume control option. Whoever is responsible for the audio deserves a fat pat on the back. The visuals are pretty decent, with clean ship models and colorful backgrounds. At no point do the bullets blend into the backdrop, with is more than I can say or some other mobile shooters.  Serenity: Renegades is an above-average mobile shooter that will likely be helped by its license. Elements of the movie are blended into the story scenes, and some gamers will just be happy to be the pilot of the Serenity, even if it is a bite-sized edition of it. The shooter action is sometimes uneven, thanks to power-ups, but there is a definite challenge toward the end of the game. But if you are not a fan of the genre, Serenity: Renegades is not going to convert you.", "date": "Oct 25, 2005"}
