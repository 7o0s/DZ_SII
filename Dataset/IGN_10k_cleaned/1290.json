{"name": "Reach for the Stars [2000]", "name_review": "Reach for the Stars", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/09/29/reach-for-the-stars", "text": "One of the downsides of my job is that I'm occasionally obliged to play games like Reach for the Stars. The game is a classic model of turn-based space conquest. You compete with up to seven other opponents as you guide your civilization to a supreme position in the galaxy. Colony ships must seek out new worlds to inhabit on a simple two-dimensional map. Since room to expand is scarce, you need to build a fleet to protect these new colonies. And once you've got that taken care of, it's time to start taking from your enemies. You never did play well with others. Sound fun? It seems like it ought to be, but there are some definite problems with Reach for the Stars that keep it from being as good as it might be.  In short, Reach for the Stars is somewhat unexciting and confusing. There's a little bit of fun here for the really rabid game playing types, but unless you've been shipped off to a desert island with no other games, this one probably isn't worth much of your time. There aren't that many places where you can get your turn-based space empire fix right now, but even so, this one is just too lackluster to hold your attention for more than an hour or two.  And it's not that I have anything against turn-based strategy. Goodness knows it isn't that. And I love space strategy games as well. In fact, one of my favorite games of all time has still got to be the original Master of Orion. But what works in that game just doesn't hold up here. This is particularly disappointing because Reach for the Stars (RFTS from now on on account of I'm lazy) has a lot of depth in the design. It just falls short on the implementation.  What do I mean by that? Simply that the game interface is too cumbersome and too hard to navigate. You can switch back and forth among the star map, colony management, research, ship design and production screens pretty easily but the information contained therein is scattered about. There are also screens for diplomacy options as well as a few summary screens that offer information about the overall state of your empire. The main star map has the most problems here. First off, there are two large menu arms that cover a lot of the screens in order to provide you with information on your fleets and colonies. They obscure far too much of the star map and, while they do offer loads of hinkfo, they don't present in a way that's easy to understand.   On top of that, the game seems too much like a board game. Now, I'm not against that necessarily, but whereas a game like Risk II can add depth to the board game experience with all sorts of animations and summary screens, RFTS is really static and indecipherable. I understand that there are lots of info screens and several ways to get at the same type of information in RFTS, but the click-to-fun ratio is low here. Rather than setting your options up in simple pull down menus or lists, RFTS puts everything in rings I'm not claiming to be some sort of gaming genius or anything but even after reading the manual and playing through the tutorial, it still took too long for me to accomplish even as simple a task as designing a new ship.  And in terms of technology, there are some other problems. First off, there's too much obsolescence built into the system. In other words, as you research new technologies, the old ones become mostly useless. Basically you can get better lasers, missiles, shields or engines but apart from saving money, there's no reason to use older equipment once you've got the newer stuff. I know this is usually how it works in games but I guess I expected there to be a greater variety of weapons and ship components to choose from. There's also a dearth (that means shortage -- use it and feel smart) of purely economic improvements. Nearly everything in the game goes on a ship. I'd love to have seen some more depth in terms of colony improvements or diplomatic advances.  Ship combat is another headache altogether. In this case, there seems to be a lot of tactical depth to the interface, but I found myself getting frustrated with the setup. While you can set engagement distances and formations, you can't set aggression levels, or even worse, prioritize targets. You and the enemy fleet just line up across from each other and take turns firing randomly into each other's formations. I felt far too disconnected from the combats and found myself either frustrated when I lost or disinterested when I won.   Now having said all that, there are some high points to the game (but in trying to parallel the game, I've decided to bury them here). For one thing, the races are varied and interesting. While there's not that much personality in their behavior, the 20 or so races each have unique abilities and environmental tolerances. And if you can get into the game RFTS also has lots and lots of replayability. There are several options for campaigns and a really amazing scenario generator that allows you to set all sorts of variables. But like I said, the game just isn't fun enough to keep you occupied long enough to explore all of the options.  Some of the visuals in the game are impressive, but in trying to make things as exotic as possible, the designers have succeeded in making things confusing. It's really hard to tell what a ship component does without refering to the description.  The whole time I was playing the game, I kept wondering what the point of it all was. I mean, there are some neat things about the game, but there's not nearly enough fun for the time you have to inveest. I'd love to see the same ideas behind RFTS run through an entirely redesigned interface with a little more depth added to the economic aspects of the game. But since my wishes only rarely come true (my 3 Stooges Robot Babies cartoon never did seem to materialize, did it?), I guess I'll just have to bide my time until Master of Orion III makes its way onto the scene.  -- Stephen Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
