Scream Team", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/11/08/monsters-inc-scream-team", "text": "If you haven't seen the movie, go, go now! Pixar has done it again.  Responsible for great CG movies such as Toy Story, Bug's Life, and Toy Story 2, Pixar hits another grand slam with Monster's, Inc.  Monsters, Inc. stars Sulley and Mike. Sully is a huge, blue, furry beast and Mike is a small, green, one-eyed monster. The two live in Monster world, an alternate dimension where people are monsters. They work for a company, Monsters, Inc., and it's their job to collect children's screams.  This is accomplished by going through doors, which act as a dimensional gate to the human world.  Screams are collected in storage tanks and act as power for the city, the way electricity powers our world.    Gameplay In the game you play Sulley or Mike. Your mission is to scare kids (well in this game, robot children) and collect screams. This is a platform-based game where you take your monster and explore the many worlds of Monster Island (Not the one Godzilla lives on... too bad.).   You must collect jars of Primordial Ooze, which fills up your scare-meter.  As you collect more ooze you have the ability to scare different colored children.  Red children are the hardest and Blue ones are the easiest to scare.  If you come up to a child and do not have the corresponding colored bar in you scare-meter, the child will just laugh at you, and you will have to find more ooze.    There are several other items to look out for in the game besides the Primordial Ooze. The Bag 'O Calories which looks like a bag of chips, replenishes your life meter. Extra Try Tokens are coins that have a picture of Mike and Sulley on each side and gives you an extra life. Finally, monster tokens have the Monster's Inc. logo pictured on them and collecting all 10 in each level will unlock a surprise (Don't worry I'll tell later on.)   There are a total of 15 levels in the game.  There are three areas; Urban, Desert, and Arctic are the three training grounds you must explore.  Each training ground has four sublevels.  Now I know what you're thinking, that's only 12 levels by my math.  But ho ho, after you complete an area Randall, an evil purple chameleon monster, comes out to challenge you to a race.  Not only must you beat him, but along the way there are monster coins to collect.  Collect enough monster coins and speed past the violet villain or you be unable to continue you quest.  So if there are 3 areas that means Randall challenges you three times. Adding the previous 12 levels, that makes 15.  Boo-Ya!  There are three rankings when you complete each level.  Bronze, Silver, and Gold medals are awarded to you depending on how many tasks you've completed.  To obtain Bronze, you must scare five children.  For Silver you must collect the 10 monster tokens scattered throughout the levels (Told you I'd get back to that.).  And to obtain that coveted Gold Medal you must scare all of the children on each level.  Obtaining the Bronze Medal in each sub-level of one training ground, unlocks a hidden item.  This item will enable you to collect all of the monster coins you weren't able to reach in the previous sublevels.  In the Urban level you unlock the trampoline.  The desert holds the speed arrows.  And getting the bronze in the Arctic unveils the Flingshot, a tool that will fling you over great distances.    Now, I know what you're thinking, sublevels, coins, medals, sounds like your typical platform game.  Why would I go out and buy another Disney movie game?  Well I haven't told you the best part.  After completing each level you are rewarded with an animated clip of the movie!  I couldn't believe it!  As I completed each level, the ability to watch a piece of the movie, drove me to play the game more and more.  How much of the movie is in this game?  Now I'm here to tell you that, no the entire movie is not in the game, but it's still fun to watch.  The controls are good. At no point in time did I say, ~When I push up, you go forward!~  Not too stiff, not too loose.  Your basic platform game controls.  The camera did offer some difficulties at some parts and not being able to judge how far the other platform is fairly discouraging.  But never did the camera do any funky changing in the middle of doing something really important.  And the ability to move the camera angle around you and going into first person mode are always nice pluses whenever I play a game.    Another interesting feature is actually scaring the children.  Now assuming you have enough Ooze (I love that word, and the fact that it's not in the movie makes it even more bizarre.), whenever you go up to a robotic child it takes you to a new mode.  The game shows you a series of buttons, which you must rapidly push to fill your scream-meter.  At the end of the session you must push X and your monster will do some funny sequence.  It reminds me of Bust a Groove, except there's no music or dancing (Unless you consider the weird bodily movements and facial expressions the monsters make in an attempt to scare inorganic children, dancing.).  Graphics If I were to say that these graphics are phenomenal, you could say I am a bold face liar.  But to be honest the graphics aren't that bad.  If I had a word to describe them it would have to be ~decent.~ Very simplistic.  Having those movie clips in the game aren't helping any. In fact when you see the beautifully rendered fluffy hair on Sulley during Pixar's movie clips, then you witness the blocky polygon shape of Sulley in the game, you'll see what I'm talking about.   Sound Now we come to my favorite part of the game.  By favorite I mean least favorite.  The sound is by far the worst feature.  And it's sad because every other aspect of this game is good.  Now the music and the sound effects are fine.  The game plays your typical Disney, non-distracting, platform music and the sound effects include your typical funny, bonks and whistles.  No problems here.  The voices are horrible.  Billy Crystal and John Goodman are the voice actors in the movie, but are not the voices featured in this game.  What makes it worse is the fact when you unlock the movie clips it's totally obvious that they did not do these voices.  Another tiny annoyance I have about this game is scaring the robot kids.  It's not because the voices are so unrealistic, oh just the opposite.  Every time you encounter a robot kid and proceed to scare the living daylights out of him, he lets out this high-pitched, eardrum-shattering, shriek that could wake the dead.  Now if this were a one-time deal, I'd say okay, I'll let that one go.  But considering the whole point of the game is to scare children, you're in for one big scream-fest.  I was very surprised with Monsters Inc. When I was handed this game, my first reaction was, ~Oh great, another Disney game.  This should be fun.~ (Add very sarcastic tone now.) But when I started playing it, I was happily amused.  Sure there were no impossible enemies to pass or any annoying bosses, but when you make a game targeted for kids you don't want to include any vague mysterious puzzles or bazooka toting, trench coat wearing, monster. I fully enjoyed this game (When I lowered the volume) and would say this is a must by for any parent looking for a non-violent, fun, challenging, puzzle game for their children.  For all of you who aren't parents or kids, though I was pleasantly surprised by this game, I would suggest you spend your money elsewhere. You could rent it, but this game is really targeted for kids.  Now if you do like this sort of game and you're just ashamed to admit this to your friends, I would suggest playing at 11:00pm to midnight or telling your friends you thought you were buying some survival horror game. ~You know Monsters Inc... IGN said it was great. Shut up!~", "date": "Nov 8, 2001"}
