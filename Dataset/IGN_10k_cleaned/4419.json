RPGs come in second, primarily because of an interface and combat style that varies from game to game. First-person shooters, while they vary wildly with visual themes, level design, sound and multiplayer features, are much more immediately immersive. So when a strategy game does not have a tutorial or any introductory features to speak of, it can be slow going.  With Dominions II,  figuring out how to set up the game entails a massive amount of reading. While most other turn-based strategy games won't provide more than half a dozen factions to choose from, here you get an avalanche of no fewer than seventeen, each with a wealth of differing statistics. Each faction has different kinds of military units, magic school affiliations, priest types, and a Dominion, which is in this case a unique faction ability, although the word ~dominion~ is used for two other completely different statistics elsewhere in the game. Each faction has an exhaustive history that can be either interesting or irrelevant, depending on your tastes.  But we're not done yet. You still have to pick your god. In keeping with the theme, you'll have a grand total of thirty-seven at your disposal, each with a different price tag and set of a dozen stats including things like strength, attack and defense, encumbrance, morale, magic resistance, leadership (separate from morale, apparently), and movement. Oh, then there's some random bonus skills you might get, the number of which vary from god to god. Some can fly and are resistance to poison and have bonus movement in mountain terrain. Others can regenerate and are shock resistant and stealthy. All of these bonuses have detailed pop-ups that explain what they are. Some gods have no bonuses.  Then you have the eight magic schools to choose from. Well, you don't choose so much as you buy points in each school, thus increasing the overall setup variety far and above any other game I have ever played. But wait! There's more! You still have to choose your god's Dominion, different from the Faction dominion. This time you have to deal with a set of six arcane scales like a puzzle from a Myst game. I've gone over the descriptions in the manual and in-game, and I'm still not sure how to explain how that stage works. You give your god bonuses, but the scale aspect also introduces random negative events that correspond to the scale you've chosen to add points to.    If you can believe it, this is just the Cliff's Notes introduction to the game. Why did I take the time to write about what you could have discovered yourself within a few minutes of starting up the game? To point out that it takes three fat paragraphs to explain what the hell is going on to someone else. This should not be. It is possible for a strategy game to be too complicated, and Dominions II achieves this dubious goal with flying colors. I even left out the part about choosing your fortress, because really, this is kind of ridiculous.      Also, if you want to cancel a setup stage and go back to the previous one, that's not possible--you have to start from scratch if you accidentally click on the wrong scale and waste some points on something you don't want or are confused about and want to avoid. Then, if you spend too many points, the game notifies you and won't let you actually start playing. Okay, I'll just go back and undo...Ha! That's right, I can't go back! I guess I'll just start from scratch...again...only there's no menu option to go back. Yes, dear readers, you are stuck. You have to exit out of the game using one of your favorite Windows ~get the hell out of this app~ keyboard shortcuts like Alt+F4, CTRL+ESC, or good ole' CRTL+ALT+DEL.  Well, when you finally get all that figured out, you'll get to the actual game, featuring an overhead, 2D geographical map dotted with unlabeled icons and framed by an interface stocked with action buttons and more stats. There's a ton of things you can do, from setting taxes to checking your income, supplies, resources, and population. You can recruit units (each with their own exhaustive stat sheet) or hire mercenaries. Or both! It's a nasty world out there, and you want to be prepared, am I right? So it would be great if there was a tutorial, right? There's not. The manual begrudges some basic information on what you should do for every turn, but doesn't offer any keyboard shortcuts to access all the options they mention. It wouldn't be such a bad thing if these options were listed in the top layer of the interface, but they often many clicks underneath. The manual also explains what all the mystifying map icons represent, but it would have been far smoother to add some tool tips.  Combat is similarly disappointing. It's automated and happens invisibly, although you can go back and watch it in real-time after your turn is over. You'll be able to set a bevy of strategies and formations, of course, so there's a lot of trial-and-error until you find a combination and a unit selection that's strong enough to hold its own. It's probably best that combat isn't interactive, since the visuals are rather underwhelming. The terrain is fairly well modeled in 3D, but the trees and the units are all sprites. Animation is minimal and sound consists of bleeps and bloops. If it wasn't obvious by now, Dominions 2 is truly a game for the hardcore grognard.     During the setup phase of the turn that precedes this combat phase, you'll be able to tweak production, research magic, create items, build stuff, and more. I imagine the sheer amount of Stuff to Do is great for those who can figure out the interface and the long-term effects of each decision, but for the average gamer there's an awful lot of trial-and-error here too until you figure out what to avoid doing at what stage based on financial limitations and strategic relevance. I constantly found myself going back to the manual to figure out what does what and what would be a better choice at a given stage. Unfortunately, as the game progresses, the lack of automation on these decisions, or a window that condenses the usual decisions into a few boxes you can click, makes for some tedious micromanagement. So many units stacks to manage, and they must each have a hero unit. So many spells to research, buildings to make, and items to create.  Since the AI doesn't seem to have much middle ground as far as difficulty, you'll either beat them silly or be embarrassingly driven into the ground. Multiplayer is hampered by the lack of a server browser or matchmaking.If you can get past the faults of the interface and almost complete lack of guidance, there actually is an interesting game underneath it all. It's not for those who like pretty pictures, but playing a god isn't a bad time to spend an afternoon--converting the heathens, gathering armies, crushing your enemies and hearing the lamentation of the women. With all the statistical variety, it will never be the same game twice, either. And, like a BioWare RPG, you can sit back and read about all the units and items and such, which is a diversion that serves to immerse the player in the game's universe. The music, mostly ethereal chamber music, doesn't hurt either. Unfortunately, most people don't have time to defeat a game's problems before they lose interest in defeating the enemies within it.", "date": "Feb 2, 2004"}
