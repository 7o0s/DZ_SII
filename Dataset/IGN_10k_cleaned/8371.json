Vijay Singh, the annual extension of their prime golf franchise. Digital golf is currently dominated by one name -- Tiger Woods -- but Gameloft's newest entry into the category is solid enough to win fans that may not be pleased with some of the changes made in EA Mobile's latest edition of their venerable golfer. Namely, EA Mobile tossed swing meters in an effort to make mobile golfers learn the ~feel~ of their digital clubs to make proper shots. Not Gameloft, which keeps all of the familiar mechanics of video game golf but strives to further fine tune an already enjoyable series.   Pro Golf 2007, which was tested on a Sony Ericsson w810i, is not a huge leap over previous editions -- but much like a set of golf clubs, there are certain comforts to be had in the familiar. The newest addition for the 2007 entry is what Gameloft calls a ~hillside management system,~ which is a quite fancy way of saying the courses should be thought of as entirely 3D. No longer is it just the putting green that has slope and grades. Now, you must take into considerable a fairway that is not entirely level. For example, you must weigh decisions when going for a massive drive into uneven territory. If you manage to hit the ball with perfect power and accuracy, you can sail right over trouble. However, blow your shot and you may drop the ball on a decline that rolls it farther back from the green than if you had just played it safe and dropped the ball right in front of the decline.   To make things fair, you can get a nice view of the fairway before planning each shot. You can see not just a tree flanking the fairway, but also how that tree extends into your possible shot trajectory. These added obstacles are definitely realistic, but they also goose the game with some added difficulty. Casual golf fans may be able to breeze into the game, but they will be hard pressed to finish off a tournament with a decent standing. Pro Golf 2007 demands practice, and fortunately, Singh's advice and coaching is almost always a just button away.   Gameloft adds some RPG-lite elements to your mobile golf career. As you advance through the game, your earn cash for buying new equipment and skill development points that affect your performance, such as drive. If you keep on top of the game and really work to win each consecutively unlocked tournament, you'll train up a rather competent duffer.   Pro Golf 2007 walks a very precarious tightrope, as the game does not hand you any free victories. You will have to fight for every inch of the fairway and I could see this being a turn-off for the most casual of the mobile crowd. If you only have the desire to enjoy a little golf, I recommend considering one of the putt-putt games on the decks, such as Digital Chocolate's Mini Golf Magic. Dedicated players are better served here, although I think the in-game lessons with Singh should help players that want to stick with their investment get a little more mileage out of it.   Should you be up for some pass-and-play, the option is provided.   Pro Golf 2007 looks rock-solid on the w810i, a handset which features a bright, crisp screen. The courses are alive with vibrant greens and blues. The on-screen icons and course information are easy to read. The game also features some expertly captured sound effects, including crowd reactions to near misses.  Right now, you couldn't have two more disparate choices in mobile golf. EA Mobile's Tiger Woods offers new controls and real-world courses. Pro Golf 2007 utilizes familiar controls and some well-constructed fantasy courses with a real 3D feel to them. There are legit reasons for choosing either one, so let me ask you this: How much do you want out of a mobile golf game? If you want easy-peasy thrills, you'll find those in only a limited quantity here. Pro Golf 2007 gets tough fast, and you may find yourself squeezing your handset until it cracks. I recommend only serious mobile golf fans apply.", "date": "Apr 16, 2007"}
