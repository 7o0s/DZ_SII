Alien Front Online has been long overdue.  It was shown two years ago at E3 and now, as our Dreamcast begins its slow journey to Avalon, we finally receive this tank based action game and some people wonder if it's even worth paying attention, let alone buying.  Let me put some questions to rest  even though it may be forgotten, Alien Front Online is one of the more impressive games on the Dreamcast, not necessarily in the visuals or the depth of gameplay; in the latter sense, it's a pretty simple game, a Quake with tanks, so to speak.  What Alien Front Online brings is a pretty sweet online package added to a single player mode with lots of missions.  Let's just hope they tweak the online servers as they plan when the game releases later next week.  Based off the original SEGA arcade game, Alien Front Online puts you in the role as the invading alien army, with their strange vehicles and weaponry, against the US Army, with their big tanks, bigger guns, and diehard attitude.  The emphasis with Alien Front Online, as the name implies, is online play and Alien Front Online boasts eight players games, with three play modes, six different stages, and most of all, voice chat.  Yup, it's time to dust off that Dreamcast microphone you got with Seaman because you can now communicate with teammates and talk trash to opponents with the Dreamcast microphone.  While playing online, press the Y button and that will give you about 5-10 seconds to talk into the microphone.  Once you speak through the microphone, you're voice message will be relayed to everyone a few seconds later.  There's a delay in the voice messaging and as the message is playing, no one can initiate the voice chat until the message finishes.  It's a pretty neat gimmick that works decently well; I just wish they included a warning icon that lets you know when someone is about to record a message.  Often, I'm trying to say something through the mike when a voice message from another player begins to play, interrupting my message.  The visuals are pretty sweet;  there are some great explosive effects, almost everything can be blown up in some way or form, and there are cool death animations when you destroy enemies (particularly the aliens).  Backgrounds are pretty well detailed, with all sorts of cool texture effects.  For example, in the Washington DC levels, the aliens have set up a base that looks like its alive  think the ~creep~ from StarCraft except there's eyeballs looking around and organs pumping with life... it's pretty cool, but disgusting at the same time.  There are some really cool weapon effects, especially with the nuclear warhead and gravity ball weapons and it's always nice that to see a pretty smooth 60 fps frame rate.  The frame rate lags a bit when the action gets pretty wild, but overall, the game looks really good.  Gameplay is relatively simple; whether you pick Army or Alien side, you select from three different vehicles, with varying stats in speed and armor.  All the Army vehicles are tanks while the Alien machines vary from a hovering scout to a four legged monster that resembles a super-sized crab.  There are three modes of play: deathmatch, flag, and fortress.  Death match is pretty self-explanatory, flag mode awards a win to the team that holds the flag the longest, and fortress is a very tough play mode if you're the invading side.  In Fortress, the defending team must protect his base from an invading team but it's actually harder on the invading team as there are turrets that regenerate surrounding the base.  Defeating an enemy will award you with health and most of the time, a sub-weapon.  Sub-weapons are extremely useful and come in a variety of forms like guided missiles, turbo boosters, cloaking devices, gravity energy balls, and even nuclear warheads. Controls are pretty intuitive with analog driving your machine, A button firing your main weapon, B button firing your sub-weapon, and the triggers enable you to strafe.  Although there's not a lot of depth, there are some pretty important skills in using the strafe feature and knowing exactly how to dodge enemy attacks; mastering the ability to fire while dodging shots with your tank moving backwards is one of the most valuable skills to have.  Although you'll probably get tired of playing arcade mode in about thirty minutes, there is a very Campaign mode with over 20 missions with different scenarios.  Depending how well you perform in the campaign will open up five different endings and it's not going to be easy to unlock all the endings.  In fact, some of the latter missions are frustratingly tough, requiring you to figure out an exact path of where to go and what targets to attack first.  Of course, a big part of the gameplay comes with the online play that Alien Front Online is touting, especially since there's no split-screen versus mode.  Unfortunately that's where most of my gripes with the game originate.  Getting online isn't much of a problem, and setting up games is pretty easy.  The hard thing that many gamers might run into is that there's no online chat lobby; if you want to setup a game with specific people, you better give them a call before hand and tell them what game to look for.  Then there's the actual online play and if you play a game with four players (two on two), it's pretty stable.  Any more than that, and the server starts getting a little funky, giving warnings about reconnecting with other players and eventually booting you out of the game.  As stated above, the voice chat, while pretty cool, is also kind of clunky;  you'll be trying to speak and in the middle of your message, a voice message from another player will come on to interrupt you. And to the Broadband Adapter hopefuls, sorry, this game doesn't support the Broadband Adapter. Alien Front Online features a host of solid options, good single player modes, and pretty intuitive gameplay system.  Although there are problems playing online, SEGA is streamlining the servers everyday; there might be a few problems when I got online today, but they've certainly improved significantly since the first time I tried it.  Alien Front Online really shines when you get eight players in the heat of battle, and when the game releases, players will know how war is truly hell... a crazy, trash-talking, teeth-grinding, fun type of hell.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Aug 3, 2001"}
