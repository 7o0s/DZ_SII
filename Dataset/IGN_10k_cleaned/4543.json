Unfortunately, the excellent track layouts and pleasing arcade physics were ultimately marred by three major flaws: The lack of tracks, blurry graphics, and a boring two-player mode.When we first heard about the semi-sequel, GT64 Championship Edition, and saw the first screen-shots, we were excited. Surely Imagineer had learned from its mistakes in MRC and would serve up a deep, challenging racer. Unfortunately, the truth is that GT64 is a worse game than MRC.GameplayGT 64 handles much differently from MRC. The steering and vehicle physics are more in tune with Sony's Grand Turismo. You won't be able to speed through tight turns without easing up on the gas pedal and strategically follow the (invisible) racing line. Players choose from 14 official GT racing teams with their fully licensed cars (Supra, NSX, and more). Before jumping into the races, you can tweak transmission, steering, brakes, tires, suspension, spoilers and the gear ratio. So far, so goodBut once you jump into the races, you will probably be appalled by what you see. You drive against seven other cars in the one-player mode, of which you will see a maximum of three on screen at the same time. The handling and car graphics aren't even all that bad --but everything else is simply sub par. MRC was fun, right? But it was also dreadfully short. Three tracks simply won't last very long. So how many does GT64 have, a game released in late 1998? Three.To be fair, there is a short and a long version of each track (Japan, Europe, USA) -- but almost every other N64 racer has 10 or more tracks nowadays or at least offers different road conditions to make things more interesting. GT64 simply doesn't have what it takes in the gameplay department. Once you have driven each course once, it gets boring faster than staring into a tub of lard. It doesn't help that GT64's Championship Mode forces you to qualify for each race by driving a full three laps on the often over-long tracks in an attempt to prolong the play experience. Sorry, but racing three tracks alone on the same track over and over again before racing the same tracks for another three laps against a gang of lacking AI drones is not our idea of fun. The two-player (vs. only) mode is even worse, with slow controls and choppy framerates. No steering wheel support, either.GraphicsSome games have amazing music, causing the graphics engine to slow down a little. Other games draw tons of cars and track detail on screen which causes the engine to slow down. Some run in hi-res or feature specular highlighting, lots of alpha-channeled objects, reflection mapping or lightsourcing and in response run a little slower. GT64 has none of these features. Heck, it doesn't even have music during gameplay. We're still not sure why this game has such abysmal framerates, but trust us when we're saying that MRC runs a whole lot faster. To make things worse, GT64 is blurry and riddled with tons of pop-up and sloppily designed textures that don't quite line up. Weather conditions? Uh, sure. How about some grey fog? What a shame. The cars actually look quite good and the hood-view camera option is excellent.SoundBad music, but only during the menu and opening screens. As soon as the game starts, all you hear is the whining of the engines, which isn't even that great. Apart from that, there's tire screeching and the occasional ~tock~ if you hit an obstacle. GT64 will not be remembered for its sound either, that's for sure.What a disappointment. GT64 looked really cool in screen-shots, but the depth of gameplay is just not there. This game has sloppy graphics, mediocre sound, and about as much replay value as Gran Turismo's intro scenes. The physics and gameplay are fun for a short while, but once you've seen each track, things go downhill rather quickly. It's okay for a coin-op racer to have three tracks, but when you shell out $60, you want the game to last longer than just an hour. Rent this one if you're really starved for a racer, but please don't buy it.On a sidenote, there is also a Japanese version of this game with two new Japan tracks (but it doesn't have Europe and USA). If only all five could have been in one cart.", "date": "Sep 12, 1998"}
