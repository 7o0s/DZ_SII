We all have our fair share here in the office right now, but I was lucky enough to pick up another one of those tycoon games. So you understand, I wasn't really expecting much when I picked up the box and opened it. But, contrary to the sorry contents of the box, the contents of the game are actually kind of entertaining.  But those ~sorry contents of the box~ were really sorry. The manual is actually just an installation guide and the cd doesn't even come with a jewel case. Now that wouldn't have bothered me in most of the value titles that are released to stores, but this game actually involves quite a lot and consequently was pretty annoying to get into, which will undoubtedly turn some people away. There is a tutorial and a help menu, but even with all of this, it's more of a trial and error way of playing until you can get accustomed to how the game plays and responds to your actions, which could take a while. And there are some things that I never did figure out such as what the icons over the customers' heads meant. Oh well.  But onto the game... So most of you are probably asking, ~what the hell is Fast Food Tycoon anyway?~ Pretty good question. That's exactly what I was asking myself and why I chose to review this game out of the bargain bin pile we had to choose from. Basically, it's an funny little economic simulation that challenges you to become the most successful pizza business in the world. There's more to it than that, but we'll get to the funnier ideas in just a minute.  The basic rundown is this: When entering the campaign to dominate the globe via pizza, you create an owner or use one of the pre-existing owners and then pick a logo, color and name for your business. A map showing all of the various cities that you can try to take over then will greet you. Each city has a different number of competing pizza businesses along with different goals you need to complete in order to take the city such as to gain 60% of the city's business or the best menu or something like that. In order to complete these goals, you have to start from the ground up by either renting or buying a building where you can start your first pizza shop in the city.  After you grab a building, which come in three sizes and thusly three prices, you need to furnish it. There are quite a variety of furnishings to choose from in the game including different types of ovens, tables, chairs, floors, plants, statues, and other fun things like jukeboxes and video games. All of the tables, chairs, and floors are divided into five categories that go up in quality and price. These will of course have an effect on what patrons think of your establishment. Not only that, but it's also a bit like The Sims and gives you a feeling that the place is yours and not just some generic place even though, for all intents and purposes, they are. None of the buildings have custom designs so you won't be able to knock walls down to create the perfect space like you can with your houses in The Sims. But that isn't the point of the game.  After you've furnished your place, you need to hire chefs, waiters, and managers. There is a large pool of help that can be found around the city, you just have to be careful about who you pick to fill what positions. Each of the potential employees has attributes such as health, personality, cooking, and managing. There's a bunch of them, and all of the attributes will effect how they handle their jobs. You can also train employees to be better in specific jobs. There are four trainable areas, which are cooking, attitude, speediness, and management. All of these can be pumped up for a price so that your restaurant will run more efficiently. You'll also need to be quick about this because your competitors will be opening up pizza shops as well and looking for the perfect employees. There were quite a few times when good people were nabbed right before my eyes.  Now that this is all done, you can complete the experience by creating a menu. A few choices will be available to you at the beginning so that you can go ahead and open your restaurant, but you will also be able to create your own original recipes from the many bizarre ingredients like ants, maggots, kangaroo, leeks, and kiwi. But part of the challenge will be to create standard pizzas that people already like quite a bit. You would think that means just throwing some sauce, mozzarella, and pepperoni on the thing, but that is far from the case. You'll actually need to go and buy some of the pizzas from rival restaurants and reverse engineer them to find out how they were put together, which is actually pretty difficult.  So once all of these things are done, you can open up your restaurant for business and start looking for the next place you'll want to open. You can move around the city via the map to find where most of the heavy foot traffic is so that you can grab the most people into your place. Good places to do this are near stadiums, hotels and schools. You'll also need to tailor the menus in the restaurants towards your demographic. So if you are near a school, you'll want to target the students tastes, which can be found in a huge chart telling what toppings they like, what toppings they hate, and what toppings are particularly popular for each demographic in the particular city that you are in. It actually can get a bit overwhelming as you can't have information up and make a pizza at the same time. You'll actually end up having to write stuff down actually if you're like me and don't have a great memory.  Now here comes some more fun after you've set your business up and it's going fairly well. You can do a couple of things to gain a leg up on the competition like running advertising campaigns that can not only make you look better, but make your rivals look worse. You can also join a syndicate and even become the boss. That's right, the mob of the pizza joint circuit. From here you can launder money, run weapons, bribe police and the mayor, and generally become really a dirty little bastard. You can sign up with several mobs to start off that specialize in different jobs or spread themselves around. If you do decide to go this route, then you can do jobs for money, ala make illegal deliveries where you control a car and try to get it to the drop-off point without getting caught by the cops. It's like a little mini-game that's pretty fun and you can make money from it. Neat. Besides that you can use the mob to purchase sabotage weapons such as rats, old cheese, and laxatives to ruin your competitor's food and reputation. Dirty, but way more fun than playing by the rules.  Graphics in the game certainly aren't the most impressive bits I've seen, but really are good for a value game. The only problem is that they went a little graphics happy. Everything in the game is a graphic. All the buttons. All the icons. And they're all cartoony, which tends to make for some confusion when navigating the menu systems. There's plenty of info here for you to absorb and it just becomes too much, especially since there isn't any way to get from menu to menu very quickly. Sound also is fairly budget, but is decent and actually didn't annoy me, which I consider a boon for any budget title.  When you consider that this game goes for around $19.99, it's a pretty good deal if you like economic simulations. Fast Food Tycoon isn't a hard-core sim or anything, but it'll give you some hours of fun equal to what you paid for it.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
