Yes, it's true - Transformers, the game adaptation of Michael Bay's filmic reinvention, is largely a poor experience that tries to do a lot with very little, kind of like MacGyver. But unlike MacGyver, it fails half the time and people sometimes end up dead.    Okay, that last part was an outright lie, but you'll definitely walk away from the Transformers game experience feeling a little dirty and used. You see, Activision took what was essentially a hard idea to mess up (giant robots smacking each other around) and, incredibly, botched it. Some of it is fun, though - which is why we're a little conflicted by how sour other elements are.   Essentially, Transformers: The Game is a brawler set in large destructible environments; however, that's not to say that the game is at all open-ended. Generally, objectives are very linear - a massive issue that undermines the game - and something we'll delve into shortly. You can initially choose to follow either the Autobots or the Decepticons through separate paths in the storyline that mostly follows the events of the film.   Awesome models, but sucky gameplay. It's sad but true.  From the initial moments of the Autobots storyline, things just feel crummy. Missions are structured around very basic concepts such as racing from one point to another, pursuing other bots through the streets and over hills, destroying marked objects and so on. It's not complex stuff by any stretch - this is a game that has been designed to satisfy a very undemanding and arguably unskilled gamer.    It's also very clean, inoffensive stuff - there is no treading on humans to be done - they even abandon their vehicles if you decide to pick one up for a spot of sedan-shot-put. All violence is of the cold, unfeeling, robotic variety - and we certainly have no issues with one hulking metal mass beating up another.   The Autobots' story arc mostly mirrors the film. Cutscenes are interspersed into the gameplay, tearing you out of the action for a few moments of cheesy dialogue and surprisingly average CG work. Shia LaBeouf has been replaced by a nondescript male actor who doesn't have the dry appeal of the former. Really, that kind of sets the tone for the rest of the game - everything is average and bland, lacking the humour of the film and the whiz-bang visual impact.    See the car he's holding? You'll be doing most of your initial pounding with objects just like it.  It's utterly confounding that Optimus Prime is relegated to racing around under a pointless time-limit, unable to use his beefy weapons against a character he must defeat in order to progress. Bumblebee is definitely the gameplay focus for much of the early single-player game, and his portions see a fair amount of variety.    That's not to say that 'variety equals fun', because it doesn't. Taking out a bunch of gas canisters and watching as your Autobot is pretty much forced to take damage is a kill-joy. The game ranks your highest speeds, longest throws, swerviest powerslides and so on, but there actually aren't too many instances during the missions that actually push you to excel. It also doesn't help that most of the bots oversteer dramatically in vehicle mode, which makes driving a bit of a chore too.   We also found ourselves spending inordinate amounts of time during missions just throwing objects and knocking over bots since our hyper-powered weapons were totally ineffective during many Decepticon encounters. Why give bots cool guns and then force them to uproot trees or toss giant donuts or swordfish around to deal any damage or lower their defences?    Things fare a little better in the Decepticon missions. From the opening moments, not only do the graphics inexplicably improve, so too do the missions. It's uncanny - it's almost like two different teams worked on the game. Using Skorpinok to dive into the sandy dunes of Qatar is a pleasure, and little touches like the way it automatically surfaces to cross roads and then dives back into the soil shows a rare moment of genuinely thoughtful game design.   The key difference is the emphasis on destruction and action. The Decepticon threat comes across as much more aggressive. You're still forced into playing fetch-games, but there's more raw action than irritation in the objectives. Plus, there's something so satisfying and cool about using chopper blades like a katana that it should be illegal.    On the happy robot side, the Autobot and Deception models used in the game are outstandingly well rendered. They're by far the high-point of the engine, and watching them transform on the fly is a giddy marvel. But the rest of the game is horribly inconsistent. Buildings look great when being torn apart (destruction is not freeform; it's all done with layers and degrees of deformation), but incidental objects like trees, cars and pedestrians, as well as grass and general land textures look very plain.    It looks reasonably cool, right? Don't be fooled. There are framerate issues and those cars are made of foam.  The physics engine is also all whacked out - cars spiral and flip into the air if you brush up against them in vehicle mode; trees, poles and most other environmental objects are simply sitting on the surface of the level and they give no suggestion of weight or scale when you collide with them. They simply give way and fall over like cardboard cut-outs or foam props. Disappointing, since it makes the levels feel like Legoland model villages, waiting to be toppled effortlessly.   In order to stretch the gameplay out a little further, there are hundreds of 'hidden' power cubes littered around each game area. Collecting these unlocks some extras that can be viewed from the main menu. For the keenest fans, it's arguably moot, since you can view a lot of this content online, such as the teaser trailers, extended trailers and art from the film and game. However, having it all in one place might be a boon to others.    We can't let this review go without taking one more stab at some of the more obvious faults. If you've ever played a fighting game like Dead or Alive 3 where getting knocked over can mean death by continuous and unrecoverable knock down moves, you'll understand our frustrations in one major encounter in Hoover Dam. We can't say more than that to describe the circumstances, but when it happens, you'll know. And you'll be knocked over repeatedly, while getting swarmed by large Stag Beetle bots that respawn without a pause and are irritatingly unrelenting. Ugh.   Just because it's cool, and I want you to remember what the game should've been a little more like.  Transformers: The Game is riddled with moments like this. For every cool robot-biffo battle, there's a pointless fetch quest or needlessly frustrating swarm encounter with the opposition. The Transformers themselves are definitely unbalanced, too - the Decepticons are vastly more interesting to use, and theirs is sadly the only worthwhile campaign in the game. The AI frequently bugs out - Transformers get stuck between walls, causing them to vibrate hilariously as they struggle in vain to free themselves. Whoops!   Yes, it's fun to blow stuff up. Yes, the bots look fantastic and sometimes you'll get a shiver of bliss when you knock a chopper out of the sky or kick a tank over. But the missions aren't interesting and no other cutscene sequence in the game has a patch on the stunning CG opening.    Was the developer rushed? Did the team not try? Did Michael Bay or Paramount crack the whip and reign things in? Who knows. But the result is clear - Transformers: The Game is a textbook case of everything that is wrong with licensed games; it suffers from being constrained by the film, it adds precious little to the Transformers mythology and adds virtually nothing at all to the robotic action genre. Those looking for a more legitimate Transformers experience are advised to fire up their PS2s and track down this Aussie-made beauty, because this game just doesn't offer enough to please anyone but the most fervent fans.", "date": "Jul 3, 2007"}
