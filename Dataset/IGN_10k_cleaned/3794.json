Inc., known for resurrecting with a vengeance the Twisted Metal: Black series, has thrown its hat into the extreme sports ring with the first mountain biking game on PlayStation 2, Downhill Domination. The question is: Why?   The timing is strange, and the subject matter, a downhill mountain biking game, especially from a developer well known for its sense of depravity, destruction and, even violence, is well, a little off-putting. I mean, what are the links between Twisted Metal: Black, War of the Monsters and Downhill Domination? On the surface, there is little to compare. Underneath, however, the telling characteristics of Incog's love for games shines through like a gleaming red missile icon. Which is not to say that Twisted Metal fans are going to slobber feverishly over this new game. They may very well. But while the familiar staples of Incog's craft stand out noticeably, a mountain biking just doesn't satisfy the soul the way a cool new variation of Twisted Metal would. It doesn't shock or surprise us the way a brand new game with the same dark viciousness, with the same searing arcade furiousness would.   But perhaps that's just me daydreaming. I guess I'm a little tired of more extreme sports games. While I sigh just a little thinking about what could be, what I really hope for, I must, after all, return to Downhill Domination, since I am writing this review. So...how is this game? And why should you be interested?   Gameplay  At first glance, most gamers with any experience will see Downhill Domination and think, ~Oh, that's SSX on bikes. Cool. Been there, done that.~ In the most simplistic sense, yes, Downhill Domination is indeed a downhill racing game with extreme sports characteristics including attacks, special moves and impressive multi-path courses. So, it's a fair comparison to make, and I initially made it, but it doesn't give the game a complete and fair shake.   Downhill Domination is undoubtedly fat with stuff to do. Players can select from 14 riders, including five pro riders (Brian Lopes, Eric Carter, Tara Llanes, Missy Giove and Richie Schley). The cartoon characters are funnier than they are cool, a nice variation from the standard attempts at making the riders hip and ~with it.~ The game offers 27 courses spread throughout the world, from Hawaii to the Grand Canyon to Russia, France, Japan and others, and there are numerous styles of riding from which to choose including Mountain Cross, Technical Downhill and Freeride. Free Ride is an open course, free of competitors and time restraints; Technical Downhill presents various kinds of specialist challenges, narrow courses, multiple obstacles, etc.; and Mountain Cross, a motocross-style set of races, is designed with wide, short courses and more jumping possibilities.     The larger courses represent a case study in impressive design. These are long, long courses. Just one half of any course is equal to the length of a similar course in any other game. They offer an amazing level of detail and the environment changes often. You'll be at the top of a mountain in snow or high grass and dirt, and the course will switch to forests, huts, stony sections, mine shafts, and then you'll enter into another completely different section again. The vastness of the courses is complemented by the huge amount of detail that essentially attacks the screen. From running water, be it a stream, waterfall or river, to the flurry of animated objects on screen -- from elk, polar bears, deer, vehicles and hikers, all of which you can hit or be hit by -- to lighting and other weather conditions, the game is wildly kinetic.      In addition, the courses are never flat for too long, an interesting effect. Oftentimes the courses are secretly shaped like giant half-pipes, or at least giant chutes, peppered with stuff. As a result, what one feels is the constant need to find more open ground, or at least more level ground, creating a tension that adds to the already incredible tension that exists. Furthermore, players can easily ride these courses a half dozen times and do them differently with each new ride. The level of horizontal and vertical paths is excellent and satisfying. The quantity of shortcuts, variants secret lines and the like is indeed impressive.    Which brings up another major point. What Incog has fashioned here is a truly unique riding experience. I have played other bike games before and all have failed in both technology and in delivering a sense of playability. Incog, on the other hand, has infused this game with a bizarre rush of arcade rowdiness, a feeling of immense high-speed tension, a super-charged sensation of adrenaline. First, the game runs at 60 FPS, which means everything happens instantly and it looks good while doing it. Second, the controls are instant. The game is meant for players to make split-second decisions, hammer down three-four trick combos, add a super to it, and then face a flurry or obstacles, opponents and more. You're never far from deep, deadly chasms, or rocks that look like jumps but aren't, or narrow passages that fit only two racers. It's nearly impossible to complete a super course without bailing. And by bailing, I mean breaking one's neck. These courses create a harrowing sense of danger at all times, and so players are always one step away from sprinting off a cliff side, smashing head-on into a tree or hitting a falling stalactite.    This game is designed to be played fast, furiously and with a sense of radicalism. One must take chances to make things happen, and without a doubt, players will race through most of the tracks more than a few times. And just like all Incog games, Downhill Domination is not easy -- which I thank the team for. Seriously, the last thing I want is to do is buy an easy, short game.  Back on topic, the courses and sense of speed are all very good, very good indeed, but one shouldn't forget the excellent handling. Creating a game like this hasn't been done well or often before because of the sophisticated programming involved. There are the bike physics and the rider physics, each one moving independently of the other. The development team must coordinate their individual reactions to the environment, meaning bumps, jumps, trees, water, ice, loose, hard or soft dirt, and angry, attacking opponents. It's all made very easy for us to see and not think about, which means it's done well, even if it's done in a kind of super-human, almost cartoony way.     If that weren't already enough, players can upgrade themselves with weapons or attack styles and better bikes parts. During a level, players can pick up speed boosts, recover items, attack upgrades and more. The attacks are quite fun and very useful in the later levels; at first combat just seems like an extra, but fighting is smartly incorporated into core gameplay. Players start with hits, upgrade to tail whips, and are followed by sticks and finally bottles. The bottle throwing is even balanced with a wee bit of auto-targeting to make it worth your while, and you can take first place away from the leader with a well-placed bottle to their noggin'. Players earn points (which translate into cash) by finishing in the top three, threading diamond flags, pulling off big tricks, and for their performance in combat. The more points earned, the more stuff can be bought, thus encouraging all aspects of play, speed, skill, combat and tricks.     Which brings us to bike upgrades. All of the bikes and parts in the game are represented by real manufacturers whose parts players can buy as they progress. The menu system here is a little confusing at first, and the gauges should show the current bike's characteristics simultaneously with the upgrade level, but they don't. The upgrade system works well enough, but earning sponsors doesn't appear until the later stages of the Career mode, so there's a long waiting period between upgrading your first bike and the super cool new ones that you can get through sponsors.   The single and multiplayer possibilities are well thought out and provide a large range of ways for players to sick their fangs into it. Players can choose from single or multiplayer (including Multitap four-player races), and enter training or career modes.These are brought into a larger frame of playability, with your choice of Careers. Players can pick from an impressive set of play modes, such as Specialized Career, Career, Arcade, Freestyle, TimeTrial, Freeride, Custom Tournament and Training. And for those who dig multiplayer games, as always the cool folks from Incog enable gamers to vie in 1-4 player races using a Multi-tap.    The biggest kinks in Incog's game come in tiny little packets. Occasionally, the game just hits a snag, and the normally smooth running framerate will shudder. There are minor little aliased objects once in a while, too. Though the courses are designed to be dense, creating a sense of urgency and spontaneity, oftentimes the result is an unkind, hard and deceptive course. Fast, narrow turns are followed by giant stones specifically meant to crush your skull, instead of furthering the flow of speed. There are dozens of pitfalls, giant cliffs and infinite drop-offs waiting to kill you. There are so many obstacles and things to watch out for, players rarely get the time to enjoy the levels, feel a sense of smooth, pure, unadulterated riding or a chance to catch their breath. This is the flip side of the great arcade tension that definitely succeeds, but with such large courses, one would think Incog would balance them with a spare speedy areas. Ah, well.     The trick system is generally good too. The only design flaw that prevents it from working better is that there are few large drop-offs or big enough jumps to provide a satisfying series of major combos. And, in some sneakily deceptive areas, some drop-offs are actually death drops and vice versa. Sure, players should learn the courses to increase their skill, but the second or time through, the courses are still so big filled with multiple paths that hidden drop-offs will still catch players off guard.    Graphics  Much like Twisted Metal: Black before it, Downhill Domination is not a beautiful game in the sense of being a lovely setting filled with gorgeous art. In other words, it's not designed to look as serene or picturesque in the way that Final Fantasy, Ico or even Gran Turismo are. Instead, it's a muscular, intense, well-animated and action-filled one.    The animations are cartoon-like in their motion, but speedy, economic and efficient. The art style lacks any distinction. But overall, the game is filled with motion: lots of things are happening simultaneously. More than five riders may be alongside you, swinging at you, pulling off jumps, or crashing into moving cars. Elk, caribou or vehicles may be running your way, while rain and lighting may be filling the air, and all of this happens at once. Never once do you see pop-up or draw-in. And never once in my version has it crashed.      The mixture of textures is solid, though none are terribly complex in design. But they are lots of polygons on screen filling the game with stuff to see. And thankfully, Downhill Domination never takes itself too seriously. Players can run over nearly any animal, and in places such as Japan, for instance, you ride through a series of Japanese natural baths, with steaming women sitting around in shock and awe as you peddle over or by them. Also, the characters show off a good set of animations in the character select menu. It's silly yet good fun.   Sound  After having played numerous extreme sports games, it's been my experience that the worst ones provide silly one-liners, which almost always fall flat. All of them do it, while others provide commentary from the audience or nearby crowd. Downhill Domination does a mixed job of doing both. I'll tell you this, I'd rather listen to Incog's game because it's got a constant mix of chatter, some of which are funny, instead of pointed, lame one-liners. These are subtle, in-the-background lines, not consciously created and obnxious ones. In fact, the voices, chatter, and the like are created as more of background effect than anything else.    Musically, Incog's blend of rock, rap, metal, alternative and the like never reaches a tremendous low nor does it ever elevate to the exciting, hard-hitting sounds from the first three Tony Hawk games. These songs, like the chatter, are mostly meant to fill in the spaces rather than to rock out to, and so they do just that, fill in spaces. None offend, but none spike the punch either.As American developers go, Incog has few peers. The team's level of programming skill, design and masterful sense of creating new games, each injected with a sense of fun arcade playability, is an awesome thing to behold. It's clear the team has been itching to do something else than crank out another Twisted Metal game, and to wit, War of the Monsters and now Downhill Domination convey its ability to do pretty much whatever it wants with polish and conviction. Downhill Domination is a good game, but it's a downhill mountain biking game that, while technically solid, and in many ways fun, isn't terribly inspirational, innovative or original. At the base level, it plays like a snowboarding game on wheels, and at the high level, it's a fast and frenzied extreme mountain biking game designed in the mold of SSX or even Tony Hawk. Perhaps, the reason Neversoft is making Tony Hawk Underground -- with all of its variations from the original -- is because the team wanted to do something, to make something other than ANOTHER respectable extreme sports game in the mold of the first. I for one, agree. Downhill Domination is good as gar as it goes, but it doesn't go far enough to compel thousands of gamers to rush to buy it. I hope they do, but I fear they won't. Who knows, this could be the beginning of the new wave of mountain biking games. But I suspect not. At the end of the day players are probably going to like this game -- as either a rental or a full-on purchase -- but if they've played enough extreme sports games like I have, this is neither surprising nor terribly new. My guess is that enthusiastic mountain bike fans should check it out, especially if they have a Multi-tap.", "date": "Jul 22, 2003"}
