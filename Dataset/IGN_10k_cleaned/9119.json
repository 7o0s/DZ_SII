The latest is Undercover: Operation Wintersun, a point and click adventure title from the fine folks at Sproing and dpt. The game opens as British officials receive word that the German government is working on a new bomb project. The Brits call in a noted professor for an initial evaluation of the plans before sending him to Germany to thwart the project.  Throughout the course of the mission, Professor Russell infiltrates offices, repairs machinery in plants, talks with locals in a German town, and even visits a besieged city on the Eastern Front.  But while you'll have to dodge German patrols from time to time, the game's setting is a bit generic and it really could go a lot farther in terms of making you feel like you're in the middle of the Second World War. In fact, if you just replace the Nazis with Soviets, there's really nothing to separate this game from a Cold War spy thriller.   Professor Russell isn't exactly the typical hero, which makes for a nice change of pace. His overly analytical, detached investigation into the German bomb project doesn't involve car chases, shootouts, or fisticuffs on top of moving trains. Of course, your own interest level in the game depends on whether or not you like the idea of saving the world through grade-level science experiments and logic puzzles instead of gunfire and chasm-leaping.  This overly detached approach to the game carries through into the professor's voice over. His lack of emotion during the initial briefing seems like typical British reserve, but he manages to sound just as dull and flat when discussing how to rescue one of his allies from a burning plane crash or reacting to the unexpected sniping of an officer standing four feet in front of him. The other voices in the game are just as stilted and are hardly sufficient to carry the drama of the story.  The professor is usually accompanied by one of two different operatives who are ostensibly there to provide the muscle and moxie normally required in the spy game. Unfortunately, except for a handful of scripted interactions, they seem completely useless. Even when there are guards that need to be taken out, your companions are likely to just throw their hands up in the air and urge you to find a scientific solution to the problem.   In general, most of the puzzles are fairly logical and genuinely challenging. The chemistry puzzles at the beginning, for instance, aren't terribly obvious right at the start but once you do solve them, you begin to realize that the information required to complete them had been right in front of your face the whole time. On the other hand, realizing that getting a rat drunk is the key to stealing a pack of cigarettes from a local innkeeper is a little more of a stretch.  There are a few timed puzzles here and a few opportunities to get shot, captured, or otherwise removed from the action but the game simply reloads the sequence at the beginning so you can have another crack at it. This kind of removes some of the pressure you might otherwise feel, particularly with the few timed puzzles that you run across.      There are plenty of inventory items you can collect in this game and we're glad to see that you don't use all of them. It might strike some gamers as too distracting, but we like the fact that you can carry around a broken flashlight or a canteen and never, ever find anything worthwhile to do with them. It certainly makes it tougher to discover some of the item combinations required to solve certain puzzles. As an added bonus, each new stage of the game strips you of all but the essential items required in that location.  On the downside, the puzzle system relies far too much on pixel-by-pixel scanning of each and every background to find that one specific item you need to collect or use. Looking for ridiculously small keyholes, electrical sockets, and stupid tie rods is a ridiculous waste of time and effort, particularly when those items are hidden in shadowy doorways or in one particularly aggravating case, colored black against a black background. It seems like a cheap way to increase the length of the game. If you opt to play in novice mode you can automatically highlight those items whenever you want but that seems like a cheap sort of solution.   Additionally, there are some inconsistencies with how those items are handled. The items in the environment that you need to use are sometimes selected right on the game screen. Other times they appear as items within your own inventory. We spent a good four or five minutes trying to figure out how to use an object in the environment before we discovered that the option to use it was in our inventory. There's a similar inconsistency when it comes to giving items to other characters. Sometimes you just select it and use it on them and other times you have to give it to them through a conversation option.  The 2D backgrounds are very detailed and seem like real places, thanks to the small odds and ends that are used to decorate each scene. Of course, the more details there are, the harder it is to find the one object you're looking for, but that's part of the fun of the game. There are a few movements and animations in the backgrounds, like small fires or waving flags, but the overall setting is very static.   The 3D characters fit well with the overall environment and offer a strong sense of connection to the flat backgrounds they inhabit. Some of the animations can be a bit jerky, but overall they're believable enough. The detail on the characters is generally good but leaves a bit to be desired in the close ups. The lip movements are particularly bad. Every time Prof. Russell's mouth opens and closes, his eyebrows go up and down.   Finally, the game started crashing quite a bit towards the end. Most of the time this occurred as we were trying to fast-forward through some of the lengthier (and less necessary) conversations, but it also occurred during scene transitions and object manipulation as well. Even with some restarts and a few head-scratching puzzles, we managed to complete this one in about nine or ten hours. we've seen much of lately. On that score, Undercover: Operation Wintersun is enjoyable. Still, lots more could have been done with this setting, particularly in terms of adding in more types and settings that reinforce the War. The story, though brief, is definitely enjoyable but the voice actors just can't manage to work up enough energy to really get things going.The puzzles are at just the right level for us in terms of difficulty and most, though not all, make some sort of logical sense. There's an abundance of pixel-hunts in nearly every scene, which wears thin after a very short while. The novice mode can help you spot the items you can interact with but it won't make solving the puzzles necessarily any easier.", "date": "Sep 28, 2007"}
