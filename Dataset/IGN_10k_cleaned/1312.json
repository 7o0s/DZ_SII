What makes the Pro Pinball games so worthless?  Sure, they're cheap, about $10 apiece.  But damn, they are boring!  I've had more fun watching my dog clean herself, I tell you.  The two games I've played, Big Race USA and Fantastic Journey, are practically the same.  In fact, both games are so very similar in every way that they deserve the same score.   I swear, if these boys at Empire put out just one more pinball game, I'm going to go into cardiac arrest.  Yeah, sure, the games are entertaining for a little while, but after a few minutes they go downhill and fast.  It's not advisable to make a game that climaxes within the first half-hour of play.  You see, the problem here is not that the games are average overall -- it's that the games are the same freakin' thing!  The tables in Big Race USA and Fantastic Journey differ in ways, but they're too similar for it to matter.  Point made, Fantastic Journey isn't worth the $10.  Spend it on some fast food, rent a movie, or do whatever.   Gameplay If you don't know how to play pinball by now, give me your address and I'll send Bruce Willis to roll by your pad and hit you in the face with a sock full of quarters. You've got two flippers at the bottom of your screen.  When you press some buttons on the controller, the flippers move.  When you hit the ball with the flipper, it goes careening toward one of the many locations on the board.  If you're lucky enough for it to land in a hole, go up a ramp, or whatnot, you score yourself some points.  Yes sir that's the objective.  You got to score yourself a heapin' pile of those points if you wanna make a man out of yourself.   Either way, this game lasts for such so little time that it's funny.  The substance is out the window, and the fun factor is severely lacking.  There's no satisfaction in earning a high score when you play Fantastic Journey.  The reason for this is that there's just not enough to do.  In Big Race USA, the game at least had a few unique situations.  This, on the other hand, is basic to the core.  Sure, you can get multi-balls, you can score jackpots, and you can light ramps and stuff.  It's just not exciting enough for $10. Hell, for double that, you can shoot over to Best Buy and pick up a copy of Metal Gear Solid or Final Fantasy VIII.   I can't possibly imagine the philosophy behind releasing a fourth installment in the Pro Pinball series.  The first two were rather expensive, so the publisher made the newer games more affordable.  Apparently, you have to sacrifice quality for a price break with some people.  As I mentioned in my other review regarding these games, Empire Interactive should just compile all four of these into one and sell them for about $30.  It would do the series a world of good.   But here we are, stuck with yet another game that, while not rotten, makes a poor purchase.  I will give Fantastic Journey one thing, though -- it simulates actual pinball perfectly.  The physics, movements, design, and events are as realistic as in any arcade machine.  Whether or not this is the ~make or break~ point for you, it's still top-notch as far as simulating the real thing goes.  Most other pinball games tend to lead towards the surrealistic, incorporating Pokemon or Sonic the Hedgehog as diversions for a lack of realism.  Don't get me wrong, their games are fun, but this is the best when it comes to arcade-style play at home.   All the four-color dot matrix video in the world couldn't salvage Fantastic Journey from its predestined fate.  Like its brothers (or sisters, for you politically correct munchkins), it has a bar in the top middle of the screen that displays video depending upon what you hit with the ball.  Sometimes, asteroids fly across and you have to shoot them.  Other times, words just flash on the screen, or a short pre-rendered sequence unfolds in wonderful shades of orange before your very eyes.  I'd say that it looks like the stuff you find in an arcade, but it feels too console-ized.  It might also have to do with the fact that the bar is on your screen and not lurking somewhere above a pinball table.   There are some features I like, though, like scoring a jackpot by 'releasing pressure' when you hit the ball into a special hole. Getting the 'skill shot' is cool, too -- if you hit the ball right in between a couple targets when it first appears on the table, you can get a slick 5 mil.  Although the gameplay is solid for a short while, it takes a dive soon after you start playing.  Hitting the ball up ramps and into bumpers entertains a little.  My huge complaint about it is that it doesn't do anything new for pinball gaming.  It's straight forward and very simple, and it's also been done at least three times before.    Graphics  As always, the Pro Pinball games look like actual pinball, without exception.  The pre-rendered backdrops are composed of all sorts of lights, chutes, holes, and other random accessories.  You could almost swear that the developers snuck mini-cameras into an actual machine and took photographs.    Sound Is there supposed to be music in this game?  I saw the ~music volume~ control in the options menu, but I heard no music, no matter how loud I turned up my TV. Odd. The sound effects are pretty good, too.  The random voice samples could be better, but everything else is nice.  Some of the effects even sound like they were taken from the Matrix.These guys just don't learn.  The repeated development of monotonous games that look and feel like their ancestors must be a ritual for Empire Interactive.  But as long as Take 2 keeps publishing them, these guys will probably keep on producing them.  Hopefully they'll change their tune when PlayStation 2 hits the market with its iron fist.  I'd love to see all four Pro Pinball games whipped up into one worthwhile disc.  A game like that might be worth getting.  Fantastic Journey, though, is just a sack of skin and bones.", "date": "Oct 5, 2000"}
