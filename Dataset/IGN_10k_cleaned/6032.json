Very few companies have reported on this happy little puzzler developed by Artdink, originally created for the Japanese market, and now cleverly published by Acclaim at a reasonable price on PlayStation.  ~No one can stop Mr. Domino,~ as the saying goes, and it's true. Very few can. Mr. Domino does have a strangely persuasive mix of straight-forward action elements tied into skill-based puzzle tricks that'll surely nab more of your gaming hours than you had originally planned for.   Gamers start off with a choice of playing either Mr. Domino or Miss Domino, both of whom play nearly identical, but look different, and then run along a dozen obstacle-laden courses peppered with board games, parlor puzzles, and simplistic little icons that you need to hit along time-sensitive levels. ~Hitting~ these means dropping dominoes in front of them. That's right! You remember setting up dominoes when you were a kid? Well, this game makes those time-honored skills more valuable.  The trick is in knowing the courses. They're all closed circuit loops, so that once you initially spot the items, you can drop your dominoes and then circle round for a second time and knock them over. Sounds easy, right? Heh heh. Therein lies the beauty of Mr. Domino. Obstacles, sneakily placed reset buttons, sprint and slowdown buttons, trigger and trip buttons lie in waiting everywhere ready to make your simple trip troublesome. And that's just the beginning.  Among the dozen or so levels, you'll encounter funny little domestic themes, like In the House with Grandpa, Phat Tony's Casino, and Shop Til You Drop (the first three levels), among others. Each one is cozily suburban, with Shop Til You Drop being especially bizarre in this respect. You'll buzz through a 7-11 or sorts, in which all of the products are Japanese. It's just as much fun looking at the culturally bizarre foods, magazines, and snacks as it is triggering puzzles.  Once you're ~accustomed~ to Mr. Domino  and you definitely will need time to adjust to the learning curve  a new realization springs into your all-knowledgeable head. You earn points by creating combos. Say what? Yes, combos are executed by laying down dominoes in the spots where the puzzles are triggered. Little flashing floor blocks reveal the exact spot, and you'll earn special points for them.  Graphically and musically, Mr. Domino is essentially stunted. In other words, it breaks no barriers, and is neither that interesting nor that good. But as with Tetris, Devil Dice, and so many other great puzzlers, it's not needed. It's in the gameplay, and Mr. Domino's got that in spades.  Mr. Domino is a single-player game that makes use of neither analog nor dual shock control, but it wouldn't benefit from either much, it's not a big loss.Mr. Domino is a sure sleeper hit. It looks stupid and graphically lame, and it's also priced lower than most games, so it'll make you wonder whether it's just shovelware. But we're here to tell you that Acclaim's and Artdink's little gem is a pillar of videogame goodness.The learning curve will surely drive you mad at first, and you'll have to get to grips with the control as well. It's clunky and annoying, and it gets more flustering as you progress. That's actually the game's biggest problem. But by having patience with Mr. Domino, you'll experience pure and beautiful gaming bliss. In fact, I'm damn sure many people will throw down their controllers in the first 15 minutes. That will separate the wheat from the chafe, and those who are left will have a hell of a challenge on their hands. Mr. Domino isn't easy, it's tough as hell. But by beating this game, you'll know you've achieved something really amazing.I can recommend this on two aspects only: great gameplay and clever design. You can't go wrong with a game that's strong in these two areas, and since Mr. Domino doesn't excel anywhere else, you'll simply have to go with these. I also recommend not drinking coffee or taking any stimulants before playing Mr. Domino either. Play in a calm, relaxed mood, one in which you're clear in mind and strong in spirit. You might think it's just a little domino game, but that's just the first misperception you'll have to throw out in order to stop Mr. Domino.", "date": "Dec 3, 1998"}
