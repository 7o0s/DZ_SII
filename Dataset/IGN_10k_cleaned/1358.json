{"name": "Frogger 2", "name_review": "Frogger 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/20/frogger-2", "text": "Hasbro's caught a lot of flack for revamping video game classics.  People don't want to see their old favorites tampered with, let alone just for the sake of causing the publisher's bank account to swell up.  Shoddy ports like Q-Bert, Galaga: Destination Earth and Breakout only fuel the public's ire.  Still, every now and then, one of the retro conversions hits the mark and does so with a big bang.  Luckily for the suits who've banked a lot of cash on Konami's favorite son, Frogger, the lean, green croaking machine's new adventure just happens to be this season's diamond in the rough.  Take the ease with which it can be picked up and played.  One teensy weensy tutorial stage is enough to teach nostalgia struck goobs all they'll need to know to hop right into the action.  As in the original coin-op game, the premise focuses on leaping between squares, one at a time.  Buttons have been added for croaks (used to locate baby frogs), tongue swipes (sucks in butterfly bonuses), and a double jump.  Aside from the need to locate your missing family members, who've been misappropriated by Swampy the crocodile, it's business as usual.  But base gameplay concepts are where the deja vu ends.  Development house Blitz Games went to extremes to ensure that this title would be more than a ham-handed rehash.  Stages utilize the one hop concept, it's true, but they put it into so many contexts it's hard to imagine what dangers lie ahead.  Frogger or his playable female partner Lillie could, at any given time, be dodging stampedes, hiding from automated lawnmowers, avoiding spiders as he spirals through the corridors of an anthill, or dancing over electrified tracks on a mine cart.  Let us also not forget the obligatory Indiana Jones scene wherein the heroine tries to stay one step ahead of a huge boulder.  And that's just within the first ten levels.  To codify the difficulty level as easy, moderate, or difficult would be unfair.  The ease or painfulness of the play experience is actually defined by user.  Sure, split-second reflexes and a mind undiluted by prime time TV (Dawson's Creek... need we say more?) help.  But impatience is what gets you killed nine times out of ten.  That kind of personal torment keeps the rubes coming back for more, day after day.  It's one thing to grow frustrated, knowing a title's a ballbuster by design, quite another to realize that the main character for all intents and purposes lives or dies depending on your own level of discipline.  The only thing working against the game is the frog's ability to continue at the beginning of any stage he left off at, which tips the odds markedly in favor of the player.  What's important to remember about Frogger 2, though, is that while it's a mighty fine addition to the series in terms of entertainment value, the ingenious design tricks carry on into the visual department as well.  It takes skill to milk the third dimension like this puppy does.  Sometimes Frogger's moving horizontally, other times vertically.  On occasion, he's hopping towards the screen itself.  Over, under, up or down, this guy's constantly moving through what appears to be a fleshed out 3D world, even though you're confined to a fairly linear path.  And on those rare occasions when toad boy's not required to move about himself, the background - rife with obstacles - is delighted to come to him.  Season this recipe with oodles of death scenes, including one in which the character slams face first into your monitor, and the end result comes out tops.  Shoot, the audio's not bad either.  The soundtrack's quickly thumping tunes were surely designed to get people's hearts racing.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know a title's hardcore when victory's proportionate to patience and yet even the music's working against them.  Furthermore, as platform games go, the neverending symphony of sound effects is soooooo money.  Damn Blitz Games and Hasbro for their insight into the workings of platformer fans' minds.  Curse them for their high production values and commitment to overcome the sophomore jinx.  May they rue the day they ever took a tinkle on the critics' claims of butchering a geriatric franchise.  With Frogger 2 on the market, ain't nobody age 10 and up gonna be gettin' any sleep this holiday season.  --  Steve Kim      Want to share your opinions with the world?

This is a very good rendition of Frogger  the graphics, despite being grayscale, are a very accurate representation of the original arcade game. Even the music and sound effects are darn near close to the classic. It's one of the best Game.Com games I've played  but it's not a very complex game to do on the system.", "date": "Oct 20, 2000"}
