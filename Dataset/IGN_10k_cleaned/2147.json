I'd much rather spend my review time talking about how great a specific game is rather than slam one, but I just can't with Sports Illustrated for Kids: Baseball from BAM Entertainment and Sennari. Yes, it's great that the development team is actually putting the Game Boy Advance's hardware capabilities to use in the title, but when you fail to actually make an enjoyable game, even the most impressive and elaborate graphic effects can't save it. Features Team creation modes Power-ups during seasons Battery Save Only for Game Boy Advance  On paper it looked like a charm. Sure, it didn't have the familiar Major League Baseball license or players or locations, but Sports Illustrated for Kids: Baseball (here on out referred to as SI4K: Baseball just to save my fingers) sounded to me like the design team was at least going to work on making it the best playing game it could be. And brother, I've been in the gaming industry too long to make that sort of assumption...  Let's start with the good. SI4K: Baseball has one of the smoothest 3D game engines seen yet on the Game Boy Advance. The development team worked to utilize the GBA's background and sprite scaling/rotation capabilities to offer a very dynamic take on the baseball genre. The ~camera~ is fixed behind home plate, but when the ball's hit into the field, it ~dollies~ out to where the ball will end up...or at least, that's what it's supposed to do. This engine would have given SI4K: Baseball serious possibilities in its presentation, but it's barely used to its proper potential. And that's a shame...especially when you think about what this game could have been with such a great 3D-style graphic engine.  The game also supports the link cable, always a decent thing to have for a handheld game...since it's important to be able to play a friend in a sports game. SI4K: Baseball also has a team creation mode where you can name your own team and pick your team colors...it also tracks your team and player progress throughout a season. Unfortunately the player names are out of your control. Shame, too...that was one of the coolest parts of a baseball favorite, Baseball Stars for the NES.  Now, pull up a chair -- there are quite a few things about SI4K: Baseball that bring the game down into the pit of The Really Bad Game Boy Advance Titles.   First of all, the game throws out many of the elements of baseball interface mechanics in favor of its own clumsy control...intuitive, this game is not. Clumsy is the best way to describe the button configuration, since the developers don't seem to keep with the mentality of previously-designed baseball games. The  ~throw~ button moves from the A button during the pitching interface, to the B button in the field...for no apparent reason, since the A button is not used at all when the ball's out in the field. Running is equally sloppy, since the controls to run from one base to the other is just way too confusing to comprehend -- you actually have to push the control towards the base where the runner is to get him to advance to the next base. In other words, you push the D-pad to the Right to get the first-base runner to jog off to second...this doesn't sound terribly bad, but I dare you to try and figure this out when you're actually putting these controls to use.  Worse, you actually HAVE to tell your runners to advance during any type of fielding play. Hit a nice line drive into the outfield, and your first, second, or third-base runner will stand there like a lump until you tell them to go...I can't tell you how many times I've been called out simply because the batter landed on first while the first-base runner just stood there (and where is it written in the rules that a player is out just because they're standing on the same base...whatever happened to the tag-out?).  The game balance is also extremely cruddy -- bunts are 80-90 percent successful because the pitcher rarely gets off the damn mound, and the catcher never runs into the infield to assist in the play. Steals are also extremely successful to pull off because the computer opponent never seems to anticipate them after the ball is pitched. So, once you learn this little trick against the computer AI, you can bunt and steal until you've won the game. Other things of note: there's no such thing as a pop-fly foul, since fouls are determined right when the ball is hit, stopping the play instantly. Players don't actually play the infield; other than throwing the ball to the bases, infield fielding is all under the control of the computer...and when a ball actually rolls out of the infield, the outfielders will never come to the rescue, forcing the computer to follow the ball until it comes to a stop. The computer AI is a joke, too...it'll make some seriously odd and unsuccessful decisions while you're running from third to home, even when the ball is in the infield...and it will even misjudge its own runner on third and think it can get him home while your first baseman holds the ball.  There wasn't much attention paid to the bells and whistles of SI4K: Baseball, as the interface is much less flashy than the 3D graphics used in the main game. It just feels like the designers said, ~Eh, good enough~ to all the bland text that's overlaid on the screen for the player and season information.  And while I was very complimentary towards the game engine used in SI4K: Baseball, it has to be known that the actual fielder and runner sprites are barely more than a few pixels high and move with barely a couple dozen frames of animation. Which makes it feel very awkward when the batter strolls up to the plate and swings the bat with an unnatural fluid motion.   SI4K: Baseball has a decent foundation to build a baseball game off of, but the design that's been constructed is barely adequate...even for ~kids.~ As excellent as the 3D engine is, the rest of the game is extremely cruddy and really needed some serious attention paid to the way baseball is played.", "date": "Oct 4, 2001"}
