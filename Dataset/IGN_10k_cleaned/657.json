That has changed -- Bionic Commando: Elite Forces marks the first Game Boy Color title to be developed by Nintendo's newly-formed NST studio in Redmond. And for a first shot out of the gate, the development team did a fine job bringing an existing, classic action game to the color handheld. Features Three different style of levels More than 12 levels Battery back-up Only for Game Boy Color   When you first start Bionic Commandos, you're given the choice to play as either a Male Commando, or a Female Commando. Both have exactly the same abilities, but later in the game you'll realize the differences -- there are slightly different routes for each of the characters, and there are a couple weapons that are unique to each commando. In the game, you're recruited to rescue Commando Joe (Yo Joe!) after he was captured during a mission infiltrating the evil Avars base. The reason why you've been recruited is simple -- just look at your arm. That's right, you're a Bionic Commando, wielding the power of an extendo-arm that can latch onto ledges and objects. This arm is the core to your abilities -- you cannot jump, so you must master the power of your arm by firing diagonally at ledges to swing across chasms and gaps in the platforms.  The sidescrolling levels challenge you to fight through wave after wave of enemies in order to locate each of the enemy communications rooms. Here, you'll be briefed on your mission, have the opportunity to change your weapons and items, as well as save your game in progress. After you've located the communications room, you can move onto locating the end-of-level bad guy, be it a monsterous soldier, or a giant rampaging machine. Destroy it, and it's onto the next level.  Also included in the game are two unique play modes -- locate a building in the background, and you'll be able to enter a sniper mode. In this mode, you'll have to scope out enemies in the distance and try and nail them without missing a shot. It's not easy, since the game simulates the instability of the gun by shaking the cursor. There's also an overhead mode that you can enter to score an extra life or two, but you'll have to avoid the onslaught of enemies as well as the turrets out to make you...well, dead. The overhead views are a good departure but suffer from horrible slowdown when three or more soldiers enter the screen.  It just seems awkward that you cannot jump or fire upward in the side-scrolling levels. It's obvious that NST wanted to keep with the Bionic Commando tradition by limiting the gamer to utilizing the arm for all the required movements, but it just feels wrong nowadays that you can't just climb over a stupid crate or leap over a small hole in the floor. Once you get used to the gameplay limitations, you'll appreciate why the designers didn't add the ability to fire in all directions or jump, but there's a slightly annoying learning curve to overcome, especially if you're used to action/platformers like Contra.  The game looks absolutely fantastic -- the animation's detailed and smooth, and one of the most colorful games yet on the Game Boy Color. But you just can't ignore the occasional slowdown that happens when a bunch of enemies wind up on the same screen as you. And you also can't ignore that horrible speech samples used in the game...that old Speak and Spell guy is more comprehensible than the ~voice actors~ in the game.  I admit it, I'm not a veteran Bionic Commando -- I've played the occasional game in the arcade and the NES, but I'm not a huge follower in the series. Doesn't matter though, I think the Game Boy Color game, despite some programming flaws, is a great action game for the handheld. You really do have to get used to the limiting of the soldiers movements (you mean I can't just jump over the gap???), but you'll learn to appreciate the grappling elements as the levels go by. Excellent job, NST, now let's see some more NES classics.", "date": "Jan 27, 2000"}
