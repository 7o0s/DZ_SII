I'm all for unique puzzle concepts  props to any developer that wants to try its hand at a tile-shifting puzzle game that isn't Tetris-inspired. But Double Sequence goes too far. Really. Next Wave Team  the game's developer  obviously wasn't very confident in its design: instead of letting the gameplay speak for itself, the team buried it deep in one of the most baffling and confusing presentations ever devised. The gameplay is completely lost to the designers' egos.   Meteos seems to be Double Sequence's inspiration. You match up colored tiles using a sliding touch-screen interface. Tiles rocket off one screen onto the other. The game's personified by simplistic alien beings, in this case virus organisms of various designs.   At the very least, the design isn't your usual puzzle entry. Both screens are used to display an extensive, horizontally-scrolling stack of colored tiles. It's a continuous scroll, meaning that when a vertical stack of tiles leaves the edge of one screen, it'll scroll off and appear on the other edge of the other screen. Using the stylus, players tap a tile on the touch-screen, and that tile, plus any tile above it will shoot up off the lower screen and onto the top screen. At the same time, those tiles will swap places with the same amount of tiles on the upper screen. Using this mechanic, players must group like-colors togethers on the same screen. Colors can only be removed if they're all touching, so you'll have to use the scrolling mechanic to adjust the rows to proper positions for the least amount of swaps.   Style over substance.   Admittedly, it's not a very intuitive idea or design, and it's near impossible to explain the concept in such a short paragraph. It's simple but far from simplistic enough to be pick-up-and-play, which actually hurts its ability to gain that all-important addictive ~spark.~   Then the developers went one step too far encasing this puzzle game in some sort of horrifyingly unorganized interface where players have to hunt their way through this menu system to find the next puzzle. This is an absolute no-no for puzzle game design, especially when you consider that the casual crowd is attracted to this genre more so than any other style of videogame. What does ~Scan~ do? What does ~Neutralize~ do? And why can't I move on even after solving a puzzle? These questions and more are not answered very well in the manual or in-game tutorial, leaving the player to poke around aimlessly and try and figure out the designers' intentions.It might be unique, but the game is too cool for its own good. Something's not right when the limp gameplay gets completely lost in the game's universe, and Double Sequence is a bland puzzler lost in a sea of overindulgent style and menus.", "date": "Apr 1, 2008"}
