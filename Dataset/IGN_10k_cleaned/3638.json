A recipe for success for sure, as the good folk behind Gundam have made a mint from cartoons, vids, and toys.  And now those hulking bots are coming to your celly in a side-scrolling shooter.  But with the shooter genre batting extremely low on cellphones right now, does Gundam: Space Assault have the goods and the good will to succeed? Features: Multiple levels Super attacks at your beck and call Space Gunner was a wash, Galaxian Mini a disappointment, and Top Gun was hardly the tops it claimed to be.  So, what are the chances that Gundam: Space Assault can reverse this sad trend?  Well, bless Bandai, because they rolled a winner when they pumped this baby out over the Sprint PCS Vision network.  This side-scrolling blaster is by far the best thumbnumber going on your Sprint celly right now, mixing solid action with good control.  Hey, it even has pleasing graphics.  What did we do to deserve this trifecta?  Climb into the cockpit of your massive Gundam and take to the stars in this furious battle against the forces of evil.  Wave after wave of destruction confront you during your flight through the cosmos, from big, bad robots to deadly asteroids that will certainly do more than dent your robo-armor.  But you have a secret weapon.  With a simple press of a button, a galactic cruiser appears from nowhere, ready to get your back.  This behemoth unleashes a torrent of furious, pink laser fire that annihilates anything and everything in your path.  Well, everything but the badass boss that will test your reflexes at the end of the game.  Even your superduper wingman can't take this sucka down by itself, so you're gonna have to work in tandem to finally rid this quadrant of the galaxy from evil.  The most amazing thing is that this is a strictly first-gen game, yet it leapfrogs just about every other blaster out there.  What this tells you is that somebody at Bandai actually cared enough to put together a decent celly game and not insult your intelligence and pocketbook.  The control is pretty solid, even though the fire button is activated by press in on the joystick or touchpad.  Press ~7~ to call in your support fire. Gundam: Space Assault looks pretty tight, too, for a firstie.  Your robot has a couple frames of animation, depending on which way it's moving around the screen.  The graphics are bright and colorful (although, pink isn't the first color we woulda chosen for lasers)--everything just looks good.  Not that the GBA needs to look for another job... because Gundam: Space Assault still sounds like a early bird.  There is a quickity theme when you first engage the enemy, but from then on, it's just the usual ~beeps~ and ~borks~ of an early cellphone game.  Hands down, one of the best games on Sprint's network, even if you're not a Gundamaniac.  The action is solid, the challenge is there--it's just so refreshing to play a celly game that proudly shows off a development team that gave a damn.  Download it now.", "date": "May 5, 2003"}
