Check.  3rd person action with over the top cinematic sequences? Check. Lots of blood? Check.  I can't help but feel I've played this game before, but I know I haven't.  I don't think I've played a game with a hokey story about Victor Corbett, a DEA agent sent to Colombia to extract some justice on unsuspecting criminal masterminds (haha, oh I just made myself laugh - the AI in this game is horrid, but I'll get to that later).  The way they introduce characters - with the drop down word boxes as the camera quickly zooms in - is nagging at the deepest recesses of my memory.  Ohhhh, I figured it out!  El Matador utilizes a completely unmodified version of the Max Payne 2 engine.  The second mission even had an ~escape from the burning building~ objective; apparently its sole purpose is to utilize the engine's (albeit good) flame effects. I knew I had played this game before.  For those of you who haven't played Max Payne 2, you're missing out.  It has a creepy, captivating story.  There's lots of run and gun action with bullet time where you can slow everything down to a near halt (and you can still move at full speed) whilst pumping baddies full of lead - with a wide assortment of weaponry, and an atmospheric soundtrack.  If you have played Max Payne 2, there's pretty much no reason at all to play El Matador, for other than the lame story and level layout, the game is exactly the same.  Strangely enough though, the artificial intelligence in El Matador seems to have undergone a series of painful lobotomies, leaving in its wake a trail of poorly programmed computer-assisted allies, and ridiculously stupid foes.  Where do I even begin?I honestly went into this review with no bias and neutral expectations.  Within two minutes I realized that even though it's been nearly three years since Max Payne 2 was released, the developers over at Plastic Reality have done nothing to improve upon their licensed engine.  Your S.W.A.T. team will do everything that actual S.W.A.T. teams simply don't do: they run aimlessly into rooms while under enemy fire; they don't throw flash bangs or grenades to incapacitate or injure the criminals before engaging; they provide no covering fire for you or others; and, worst of all, they can't actually hit anything.  The majority of the time your ~team~ will either get in between you and your target or shove you into a hail of gunfire (and much to this reviewer's disappointment, you cannot shoot your ~team~).  Dispatching enemy targets is a mundanely simple task.  Simply wait for them to come out of their crouching stance, sometimes taking cover behind walls or support beams, and then shoot them in the face.  What makes the game even easier is not so much an exploit but a facet of bullet time that should have been modified.  There is the option to either turn bullet time on completely, or use it for a brief period while diving.  In Max Payne 2 you could jump into a room using bullet time, and whilst moving with forward momentum, you could rotate your body to get a complete 360 degree view of the room you were diving into.  This hasn't been modified for El Matador, making the standard engagement of bad guys much too easy.  Alas, a ludicrous dichotomy exists: excruciating ease in killing the standard crony, and insanely preposterous difficulty in killing ~bosses~.  At the end of every mission you are usually required to kill a drug lord or one of his lieutenants.  Instead of the development team making their A.I. better, perhaps enabling them to exploit their environments to gain an advantage, they are instead made superhuman.  Their accuracy is increased to 100% so if you are in a direct line of sight, you will be hit, there's no avoiding it.  If you happen to get the jump on them, maybe hitting them a couple times before they can raise their guns, don't think you've actually accomplished anything.  There is quite literally about a 20:1 ratio of bullets that are required for you to kill them, versus bullets required for them to kill you.  I unloaded a full 30 round clip from my AK-47 into ~El Corsario~, only for him to laugh in my face.  Oh and by laugh I mean unleash a maelstrom of shotgun pellets up my right nostril.      There's hardly anything quick about the quick save and quick load options; loading times are anywhere from 1-2 minutes, despite having the level cached in my 1 gigabyte of memory.  This puts an unnecessary halt to the action, and during boss battles, where I sometimes had to retry 10-15 times -  even on the standard difficulty setting - frustration will easily overcome any satisfaction from completing mission objectives.  (You might be sitting there thinking ~this guy just pretends to be a gamer, he clearly sucks. 15 attempts to dispatch a boss on the default difficulty?~) I can promise you that I've probably spent a couple thousand hours playing first/third person shooters over the past decade, and I'm certainly no slouch.  This game is just frustratingly arduous.  If there are two redeeming things about the game, they are the weapons and the graphics.  There are (dual) pistols (but no Desert Eagle .50 cal like in MP2), (dual) Uzis, an MP5 sub-machine gun, an AK-47, an M4 assault rifle, and a rocket propelled grenade launcher, to name a few.  Sound familiar?  All the aforementioned firearms can be found in Max Payne; however, at least in Max Payne you would slowly be treated to the weapons as your progressed through the game, rewarded with a new gun when entering a new level.  El Matador, however, gives you about 80% of the weapons by the 2nd mission, so any reward system that could have helped the game's unfolding of the action element is virtually non existent.While I mentioned before that the game uses an unmodified version of the Max Payne 2 engine, it does appear that the graphics may have been touched up a bit.  The textures look great, as do the player models, with a high degree of detail.  Strangely, though, the mouth movements on characters during cut-scenes are atrocious and bring the game back down another notch.  The lighting and particle effects are good, but nothing really special. The sound department is a mixed bag.  The sounds for the many weapons are crisp and high quality; yet, once again, are exactly the same as those in Max Payne 2.  They do, however, sound especially cool during bullet time.  Music is a very important aspect to any game.  It can add or detract to any given situation, and is often important in establishing the mood, feel, and intensity of the gameplay.  There are many points in the game where there is no background music whatsoever.  This may actually be a blessing in disguise, for once the bullets start flying, a recurring track is thrust forcefully through your speakers.  The music is so awful during the battles that I can only sum it up one way: techno porn.  Just imagine some lame 80s porn music with a fast beat and synthesized guitars and you've got the battle theme for El Matador.  I actually had to turn down the setting for the in-game music because I couldn't stand it any longer.  Now I fear my brain has been conditioned to associate porn music with repetitive, rehashed, shallow gameplay.  My life is forever changed.The voice acting isn't nearly as bad as the joke of a script.  The characters' voices are believable enough, but what they have to say certainly isn't.  The dialogue is lame, hokey,  clich, and chock-full of unnecessary and pointless profanity.  At the beginning of one mission Corbett enthusiastically proclaims ~I need to shot some scum!~, and after grabbing a fallen bad guy's radio and listening to someone query ~what's the situation?~ (in a really bad Colombian accent) Corbett says aloud (and for only himself to hear), ~it looks like you're going to die~.If you've never played Max Payne 2, and are looking for some (otherwise) unique 3rd person action, with a lame story and decent controls, then give El Matador a try.  It's fun for a short while, but its lack of any multiplayer component really detracts from any potential longevity.  The game is a huge rip-off of its aforementioned mentor, so if you can look past the fact that other than the story, it's the same game, then by all means, play your hearts out.  I still strongly recommend you pass, as three years later, there are far better options out there.", "date": "Oct 24, 2006"}
