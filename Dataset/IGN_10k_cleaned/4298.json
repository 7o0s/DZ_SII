The world begins its downward spiral towards the end of civilization and humanity on this day. Over 150 missiles will be launched in the first moments of the onslaught set in motion by Skynet's self-aware system. Few survive to even be a part of the struggle for existence that becomes daily life afterwards. Those that do manage to stay alive face famine, fallout affliction, enslavement, and constant fear of mechanized attack. There is no future.    And all I have to say after playing this game is: Armageddon, hurry, hurry!    A rush job of epic proportions, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a system failure from the very first second you turn it on and realize it's the same engine as the abhorred Fugitive Hunter. The second of two gigantic movie-to-game ~synergy~ projects (the other of which being Enter The Matrix,) Atari Games clearly wanted to place T3 in that same limelight, and has devoted about every single resource at the company (seriously -- the credit list starts at the fold of the manual) to whip out a production with the same highlights that Enter The Matrix grabbed press for. Sacrifices were obviously not an issue -- when you cram your major franchise into the format and game engine for a title that had already been canned once and dumped to another publisher, the writing is on the wall. Whereas Shiny had all of the money, resources and access possible to craft a new engine, design gameplay in tune with the film, and integrate the game production needs seamlessly with the movie production, T3's dodgy transitions and pathetic mish-mash of live action and CG in a senseless FPS design clearly not right for the franchise has the echo of a board room, ~Oh yeah, us too~ running through the experience.        Presentation  Based half in the shown continuity of the movie and half in the imagined backstory of the Terminator franchise, you are Arnold Schwarzenegger (AKA the T-850 Terminator) on a mission to protect John Conner from a superior model robot sent back in time to assassinate the future resistance leader. Players get to experience the horrors of post-apocalypse Earth living from the eyes of a Terminator as you fight through several stages of F/K and T-model warfare on a mission to infiltrate Skynet and take command of the time portal, then slip into the leather jacket and Ray-Bans of present-day Terminator once it arrives here on its quest to save John from the T-X.     Atari's mix of movie sequences and backstory scenes is ambitious -- far too ambitious for a game that needed to be rushed out the door for Christmas and the DVD release of the flick. T3 uses footage from the movie for the parts of the game that follow the film, but while Enter The Matrix had new sequences shot by the original actors and production crew for its separate story, Atari here gets by with CG footage that slams awkwardly against the live action footage once you get to that point. Not that the movie portions were the smartest choices -- in fact, we'd rather have the fairly good animation throughout instead of the hucked-in video sequences cobbled together for the game. (In the middle of first-person shooter action, you cut to a long two-shot dialog scene just to get the backstory transition down?) Picking clips from the movie was clearly a quick fix around having to do all that CG work. There was one live-action scene shot for the game tucked away in the menu, and it does add some fun details on the truth at Skynet for fans of the series, but it also reeks of cutting-room floor footage that's only exclusive to the game because it was too corny for the flick.    Gameplay  First off, lasers are no fun against robots. Robots are big, and metal, and not really all that afraid of high-tech flashlights. Sure, eventually they'll absorb enough energy to overload and blow up, but as this game proves, getting there ain't worth the energy. T3 developer Black Ops didn't help matters much by forgetting to put impact effects like fires or sparks on the bodies of the terminators as you pew-pew them with lasers, so the first 6 stages of the game are about as fun as pretending to shoot people with your index finger and cocked thumb.        That's a minor gripe compared to the rancid meat that makes up the rest of this game. This game terminated any hope when Atari decided to stick the franchise into the Fugitive Hunter FPS engine. Just thinking about it blindly before playing the game, I couldn't help but think that first-person shooting just didn't seem to be what The Terminator was all about, but it wasn't until I had suffered through the entire game that I realized how moronic the fit was -- I haven't seen the third film, but apparently, in this one, the Terminator doesn't go around shooting much ... not good material for a SHOOTING game. The first half of the game has Arnold blasting T-model killers, but as soon as he's shot back in time, he hasn't got much to do but beat up the T-X every now and again, occasionally shooting some cops in the leg when the time comes. I spent a couple nights off and on playing through the first few stages, but as soon as I reached the present, I whipped through the game in about two hours before even realizing something had happened. It's asinine design -- early stages run for a good half-hour, but stages in the barren present may offer as little as two minutes of challenge as you run down a hall and blast one or two H/Ks before switching open a door and clearing the stage.     And yet, guess which stages are the ones with the fun guns and the cool baddies...    Black Ops' shooter engine was too rusty and junky last time out, and taken to the major franchise level of The Terminator, its scrap parts stick out for even more tetanus-filled pain. The developers left out the ability to customize the control of the sticks to the more standard look/move configuration instead of its look+strafe configuration, but it honestly doesn't matter -- you need the controls for aiming much in this game anyway. T3 eschews the subtle aim-assist of better FPS games for a Syphon Filter-style lock-on button that turns the entire game into a mobile shooting gallery. Just hold down the left trigger, and all that's left to do is blast away!    Too easy, you say? Sure, us too, and the fact that the AI on these highly-advanced terminators doesn't notice you as you plug away at them with the standard difficulty level doesn't hurt the wussy appeal of this game either. Nor does the abundance of continues in each stage. But don't worry, you'll get your share of frustrations on any challenge level -- the game's bugs and errors amp up the challenge of playing this game in all the worst ways. Your character will get stuck on or clip through rubble and minor architecture, while enemy bots will spawn in the middle of nowhere right in front of your eyes and sometimes shoot you through solid roofs. If you ever let off the button of a fully-charged assault rifle while facing a wall, your Terminator will instantly die. One stage had me shooting the kneecaps off of cops, but the game got so confused that I was aiming so low that it reset my view to look straight up at the empty sky, glitching through my body and head in the process. Some screw-ups in the game, I was never sure if it was bugs in the game or just more terrible design from the team too depressed to abort anything connected to Fugitive Hunter -- a junior high girl could underhand a softball farther than the Terminator can huck a grenade at full strength, while weapons take a dog's age to switch out (often slowly bringing up the useless weapons you passed by as you're cycling through.) I can't count the hours spent in the game's early stages trying to make buggy event triggers go off or hunting for destructible rubble in entranceways with the flakey ~Terminator Vision~ so I could finish the flipping stage.     Then there are the fisticuff fight sequences, which are, in a word, a joke. They always were a joke back when they showed up in Fugitive Hunter, and the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em button mashing here isn't improved much. There's some damage effects when you toss a Terminator into boxes or onto a tile floor, and the ~combo~ system is slightly deeper, but otherwise, these one-on-one slapfights are the kind of mini-game cheapie relics from bad PS1 and SNES games that should never have survived into the next-gen console world. The good news is that, with numbskull cyborgs like Arnold Schwarzenegger (his character, that is) duking it out, the stiff animation and robotic gameplay actually fits the characters. The bad news is, it still isn't fun in the slightest.    Graphics  For all the yammer from Arnold in press quotes and the chatter of all involved in the DVD-like extra section of this game, you'd think T3 would at least something fancy to talk about. Not a chance -- the Fugitive Hunter engine strikes again with incredibly low-res wall textures and janky special effects. And by special effects, I'm meaning the special effects that actually show up, like the way F/K Kites explode in a white puffball, the way terminators have to be repositioned slightly before keying into the explosion animation, or the hysterical kludge ~shiny metal~ texture on terminators that's applied to their whole frame that makes them look like they're made of water. (Think the blobby dark pools in Super Mario 64.) There are plenty of special effects that don't even go off -- boxes and enemy minibots sometimes just disappear instead of exploding when shot, and there's an awkward moment of nothingness with a missing (and probably censored) laser blast from a terminator as it kills a soldier in a close-up cinematic.    Presentation elements like that broken cinematic example are just pathetic for a game that prides itself on its presentation. The way fighting scenes end with a hugging grapple scrum like a boxing match with no ref to pull the tuckered-out battlers apart is just sad. Even the final, climatic battle with the T-X just sort of fades to black for a cinema to load up, and then the game is over. Other cut scenes are more dramatic for no reason -- one in-engine scene shows Arnold in close-up turning on a switch ... truly amazing. And while stiff animation on the terminator robots isn't exactly against what's supposed to be there, the way these giant robots fall down gently when shot kind of takes away from their killing menace. I could swear I saw one terminator mocapped to look behind it as it fell to see that it wasn't about to land on something uncomfortable...    It's not a totally hopeless engine, but it's clearly generations out of use. Harsh surface lighting from the flying H/Ks, for example, is a nice effect, but when you're finding yourself impressed by flat surfaces changing luminance values, you're dipping way down for compliments. Lots of stuff explodes and kicks up dust, but it's all scripted physics and basic particle effects. The wannabe GeoMod trick on columns shows that the team has a hard-on for Red Faction, but the trick just subs out 3 different damage models and textures at a set point instead of doing the effect for real, and it's just forgotten about and left out halfway through the game. And the ~Terminator Vision~ effect, which searches for things to shoot at or pick up, tries to ape the Metroid Prime info scroll but just can't match its level of descriptive detail (the same generic text blocks pop up all the time), and the effect just isn't nearly as detailed as the effect in the upcoming T3: Redemption from the same publisher (it's missing the tracing effect seen in the films, for example.) Plus, instead of pulling off any graphic trickery, it just turns everything red.     The graphic choice of systems on this game is an easy one -- rent and quickly return it on whatever system you prefer. We haven't have the joy of testing the Cube version, but both Xbox and PS2 chunk up at the same 20-something framerate, chugging even more at inopportune times (though neither system seems affected by having too many figures or effects going on -- it's just purely a mater of architecture clogging both boxes randomly.) The washed-out walls and lame character models are the same across the systems, and the Xbox can't boast much better results against aliasing. Load times are also sandwich-ready on both systems (and you will have to reload the already-loaded stage completely if you want to restart.) And don't worry, the graphic glitches and wonky animations (check out how soldiers are animated only at the knees and shoulders while running) are shared across the platforms.    Sound  Apparently, Kate Brewster and her future soldiers who sent back the Terminator this time found a later model quip-equipped T-850. Otherwise, we would have lost out on Arnold's trademark lines like ~Got It~ and ~Terminated.~ Atari banked heavily on getting Arnold into the recording booth for this game, even if the end result is about as many lines as Midway's old arcade light gun shooter -- not too far past what we were expecting from the typically monosyllabic Terminator, so I guess they got their money's worth. Nick Stahl shows his youth by reprising his role in the game, while Claire Danes claims that skirts don't go with games and bows out to a replacement (who's a pretty good sub -- and I guess the devs got even with Danes by making her in-game character model look HORRIBLE.)        In-game sound for the Xbox is carried over the typical Dolby Digital, and makes the best of the effects to be heard. That may not be much. The music in the game is pure Medal of Honor -- except for a few anvil hits, I can't imagine the heroic scales and trilling flutes in this score could be mistaken for music from any Terminator score. I don't know for sure what music played over the movie, but the clash in style and tone with the stark and cold original Terminator score by Brad Fidel just doesn't fit (which you'll be reminded constantly of when the memorable T2 score kicks in occasionally.) Also, while the zapping blasts of the lasers in the game are replicated faithfully and there are a good collection of environmental effects (sparks and water dripping, with full surround effects, are impressive), there's a lack of lines from the NPC soldiers and cops that makes what's here repeat several times in a stage. Also, at least one stage sent me running for the volume -- the mixing of the claxon alarm when infiltrating Skynet was ear-piercing enough even before it went cranked up about twice the expected volume. I could sum up my review in this summary section, but instead, I'd liketo grouse about the credit list for this game. One, because it'sconsoling in how funny it is to me, and two, because it's shocking howmany people were involved in this hurried production. The in-game creditscrawl lasts, at estimate, 12 minutes. It plays the signature T2end theme -- the same tune used to play over a half-million ILMemployees in the movie -- a total of five looped times. Big companieslike Shiny and Humongous, two outfits with enough of their own work ontheir plates to get involved here, are listed here as somehow beingroped into this production. Heck, the list was so long, I checked to seeif maybe I was on it.And all for what? A shooting game for a storyline that doesn't reallyhave much shooting in it. They should have figured out something wasvery wrong with the design when they put two Terminator punchfestsequences back to back -- there isn't even one sequence of the mainshooting game where the T-X, the game's only real villain, makes anappearance. It's all fluff gameplay -- made even fluffier because ofthat lame lock-on feature -- for a story not told so well. I wrote thisgame off as just weak for the first bits I played -- mass-marketentertainment with little challenge and not much technical finesse orpolish -- but it wasn't until I played it all the way through andsuffered the woefully lacking and unbalanced second half of the game,after I encountered stages as short as a few minutes and a final fewrounds with fewer enemies and less challenge than any moment of thegame's opening level, that I recognized this game as having eclipsedFugitive Hunter as the least enjoyable console shooter of theyear.", "date": "Dec 5, 2003"}
