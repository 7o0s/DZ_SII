We've decided to label it ~Asteroids on Speed,~ and we'll leave it at that.    The original Geometry Wars was a hidden arcade game located in the Garage section of Project Gotham Racing 2 on the Xbox. Coincidentally, demo versions of both Retro Evolved and the original are available free in the Garage of PGR3 on the Xbox 360. The demo version doesn't feature online leaderboards and cuts you off after four minutes of play. To be honest, I've only survived for four minutes one time in the billions of times I played. But available for only 400 Microsoft points, or roughly $5, the full version of GWRE is an addictive little bargain.   The visuals, while made up of simple geometric shapes, are stunning. The use of vibrant, glowing colors and wonderful particle effects make this game look like the skyline on the Fourth of July. At times the explosions of light are so intense that you feel you could slip into an epileptic seizure at any moment. The music is a fun little techno beat that never gets old. To play, you simply move your little two-dimensional spacecraft around with the left analog stick and shoot by holding down the right analog stick in the desired direction of fire. The controls handle perfectly, which is necessary as you will carve your way though thousands of enemies and come back for more.     The enemies vary from giant space snakes to simple squares to giant black holes, all of which look surprisingly cool. The entire time you play you feel like the ghosts from Pac-Man are on your tail as you dodge seemingly hundreds of enemies at a time without a hint of slowdown.   It may be a simple 2D game, but this little mixture of Asteroids and Galaga is incredibly good looking (for what it is) and super fun to play for one minute or 60. And yes, it's a little reminiscent of Fantasvision, only it's like $5 instead of $49. Snap!  All Xbox Live Arcade games should be this fun. If you're looking for a throwback to the Space Invader days with the futuristic colors and sound of the powerful 360, this is your game. It's not the equivalent to buying a full $50 game. No, it's a small arcade game with no big features, FMV, or wild multiplayer levels. But for what it is -- Geometry Wars is kick-ass Fourth of July fun.", "date": "Nov 22, 2005"}
