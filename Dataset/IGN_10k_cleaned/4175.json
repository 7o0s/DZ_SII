Sure, their games are decidedly simpler than, say, Madden or NBA Live, but that's the fault of the platform, not Sorrent itself. Sorrent is now following up their successful b-ball game with a clever little off-shoot, starring on the most hyped athletes in the game right now, Yao Ming. Does the game offer enough variety to deserve a download for those who already have FOX Sports basketball?  Features: Make It/Take It rules Play with Yao Ming One-button controls  Yao Ming Basketball '04 (which implies that if enough people buy in, there will be an '05 version) is actually a slick port of a popular basketball game in China. Sorrent wisely saw the potential and possibilities of bringing it to these shores, where Ming is only gaining steam -- his every encounter on the court with Shaq is television worth watching.  The game is played, like all of Sorrent's sports titles, from the first-person perspective. You are right outside the paint, ready to drive it on for a dunk, put up a smoove jumper, or pass it to Ming to watch the big man go up-and-under. Trust us, whenever you see Ming open, go for the pass. The game is named for him, after all, so expect few misses.  Yao Ming Basketball '04 employs Make It/Take It rules, which turn this into a fast, furious little baller. On offense, you have a ten-second shot clock. Should you score, the clock resets and you retain possession of the ball. Time your shots right and pass to Ming when he's open, and you'll go on huge runs. If you miss, though, you're on defense, trying to block shots.  Sorrent touts that the entire game can be controlled from just the touchpad, but let us tell you, for the bigger thumb-ed, it ain't easy. More than once, we dribbled when we meant to pass. And putting up the ball by mistake -- at an inopportune time -- can end a run.  Yao Ming Basketball '04 is a single-player game, unlike Sorrent's latest batch of sports titles that employ the Mobile Persona live options. Instead, you play against AI bots that actually pay attention to your techniques and preferred strategies, and then craft their own routines to counter you.  The game looks just as good as previous Sorrent sports titles, with nice clean player sprites. Ming looks quite recognizable. And the little touches like dunk animations ending in shattered glass backboards are really nice to see in a cellphone game. Yao Ming Basketball '04 is a great, fast-paced baler that works quite well on cellphones -- provided you have smaller hands. The action is quick, which keeps you into the game for much longer. However, if you have already DL'd Sorrent's other ballers, you may want to think twice about buying into Yao Ming Basketball '04.  It's really not that much different, and you may wish to save the green for some of Sorrent's future releases.  Hint, hint.", "date": "Nov 12, 2003"}
