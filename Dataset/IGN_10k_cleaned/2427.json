{"name": "NBA 2K2", "name_review": "NBA 2K2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/01/15/nba-2k2-4", "text": "Let me preface this entire review with one simple statement: I believe that Sega Sports' NBA 2K series of basketball games is the best ever produced. In terms of game play, depth and features, it is unrivaled in the marketplace. NBA 2K2, the first SEGA basketball effort on the PS2, is the finest sim basketball game yet released for the system. I say this not because I am so exuberant about the game that I can't think straight (I'm not). I say this not because I think the genre doesn't have a whole lot of growing to do (it does). I say this because NBA 2K2 is a great game, a fun game, and a well made game, but even so, it has its problems.  From the moment I wrapped my hands around NBA 2K on Dreamcast, I knew I was dealing with a contender. It took everything a basketball game used to be (unchallenging, unrealistic and arcadey) and, for the most part, threw it out the window. It redefined how console basketball games should be approached. It didn't dumb itself down for users who were well versed in basketball, but delivered a fun, quality product for those just interested in a spirited game against a buddy. In fact, although this phrase is overused, I felt the first Visual Concepts basketball title ~redefined the genre.~ That was more than two years ago.   Since then, we've gotten two more installments of the series on Dreamcast, and with each, the game improved. Defense was tweaked. Features were added. Graphics grew with the times to be even more stunning than the original. Each replaced the last, growing more and more impressive. With 2K2, Dreamcast owners were treated to the best basketball game they'd ever played. Now that same game dribbles its way onto PlayStation 2. Well, maybe dribble isn't the right word. It drives the lane and dunks. It doesn't break the backboard, but it definitely dunks. With two hands.  You can tell the folks at Visual Concepts care about what they do. Their products have always been deep, complex and dynamic, and they never forget about the ultimate ingredient in any sports game: fun. No matter how cool the animations look, no matter how accurate players' shoes and jerseys look, no matter how great the reflections reflect and the crowds crowd, it all has to boil down to fun.   Graphics For the most part, NBA 2K2 is a gorgeous game. For starters, the arenas are rendered beautifully. As you move around among the various courts of the NBA, you are super aware of the differences from one court to another. It's not just logos and colors. It's the grain of the wood that makes up the floor. It's the fans in the stands. It's the individual feel you get for each arena.  Some have stated that it looks too much like a straight Dreamcast port, and that the players have a decidedly ~Dreamcast look,~ but don't believe it. Sure, they might have a ~SEGA look,~ but it's a Sega game. Mainly, things in the game look quite a bit like they do in real life, especially from a distance. Part of this is due to the fact that the player models are varied and realistic. These guys don't look like uber-ripped roid junkies. Their body shapes are well proportioned and accurate to how they look in the NBA. Shaq looks like a man/mountain, Shawn Bradley is gangly as all get-out, and Earl Boykins, well, the kid is short and stocky, just like in real life. Of course, none of them look photo realistic, yet. To get closer to that, players' faces would have to look more like their NBA counterparts. As with NFL 2K2, a lot of the visages here look slightly ~mapped on.~ These things always get better with time. Ultimately, they are good enough to recognize, and that is a marked difference between 2K2 and some of the other games out there.   The uniforms look great too, and VC even managed to get the American flag ribbon (that all teams are wearing this year in memory of the September 11 tragedy) on them. The only thing that could make the uniforms better is seeing the fabric move around. With all these low-slung shorts in the NBA (gotta respect Stockton for his smally-tighties, though, and you gotta respect VC for noticing), I wanted to see some swish and flow. I realize the system's limits could partially prohibit such complex cloth work, but a little sway would be nice. That's all I'm saying. A little sway.  Speaking of sway, the animation in 2K2 is lovely. On defense, it is nice to see a player arm-bar the center, swat the ball away on the block, or rip down the rebound with authority. The dunks aren't overdone, but they still manage to be dynamic. The shooting animations are fluid and accurate to real-life, and they actually change depending on conditions in the game. If a player has a hand in his face when he goes up for the ball, he will launch a higher, arching shot to compensate. Some of the lay-up animations are flat-out incredible. For instance, if a talented point guard is driving to the hoop and a defender goes up to block on the right side of the basket, the player may switch hands and try the reverse.   All of this is really cool from an AI perspective, and well carried out from a graphic perspective. Things flow well. Player movements make sense. Well, for the most part. A minor gripe I have with the animation is the duration and distance it takes to complete some of the player movements. This always has been a problem with basketball videogames. Here, some of the fake-out moves (like the crossover dribble) are a little too grandiose to be useful. Sure, I want to be able to juke past a guy, but it shouldn't cover as much ground. And if I shake and bake near the sideline, I don't want the animation to carry me out of bounds. More context-sensitive animations would be nice in these situations. Not only would it help from a gameplay standpoint, but it would help to make the animations look less repetitive.   Another area that could use some work is the collision detection. This is always difficult in basketball games, and it's a definite problem here. Especially during replays, you see a lot of hands going through arms and fingers disappearing into the ball. Speaking of the ball, it rarely ever actually touches the rim on replays. And there is an invisible force field around the players' hands, so you'll rarely see a guy actually gripping the ball. None of this affects the way the game plays, but if you're a graphics snob, it'll bother you.  The bottom line is that NBA 2K2 is a step up from the Dreamcast in the graphics department, and that's all one can ask, because the DC game was already mighty pretty.   Presentation and Features The presentation of the NBA 2K series always has been strong. They've backed up the NBA license with a slick, easy to navigate game that captures the intensity and attitude of the NBA. NBA 2K2 continues the strong tradition with great menus, easy accessibility to all of the key features, and a ton of game modes to keep you coming back again and again. It sports a crisp, clean look that goes along with the SEGA Sports aesthetic, and nice, unobtrusive music to accompany the experience.  The first game that Sega Sports released for the PS2 was NFL 2K2, and when I first started playing that I was befuddled by the menus. As I played it more and more, things began to fall into place. At first, I thought that making menu selections with the analog stick was bothersome, but I grew accustomed to it, and now even like it. NBA 2K2 is based on the same Sega Sports look. Its menus are even better than its NFL counterpart. Everything menu-wise is easy to find, well labeled and intuitive. Navigating the game is a snap, and all the options for managing memory can be found in one place. If you're like me, you'll have several seasons going at once. Being able to load, save and delete game files from the same place is essential. 2K2 allows you to do this effortlessly.  Stat tracking, a key ingredient in any sports title, is also done well. Not only can you track team data, but individual player stats are broken down into last year, the current season and an entire career. For stat junkies, this is heaven.  This game is packed with tons of modes as well. Not only does it sport the standard exhibition and season mode, it has a full Franchise mode, the ability to create a custom tournament, a more arcadey street mode and extras. Each offers a slightly different experience, but all are equally rewarding. Season mode enables you to control your club throughout one NBA season, and gives you the option to sign free agents, trade and make any other adjustments to your roster that you see fit. The Season mode is a miniaturized version of the Franchise mode, as most of the same options are available. The game is good about warning you about major news, like when the trading deadline is approaching, and so forth, and the progression goes smoothly. I also like the Next Week feature, which enables you to speed up your season by simming large chunks of your schedule in one go.  The Franchise mode extends this to encompass more than one season, and there is more emphasis placed on your front office duties. This Franchise Mode will appeal most to casual gamers who aren't looking for a lot of depth and high-level management options. It's got everything you'd expect: free agent signings, the ability to trade and a college draft. But all of these options (except for trading) are pretty rudimentary. For instance, you are able to ~scout~ college players, but you don't get to see what schools they're coming from (because of licensing issues, no doubt), they have no pictures, and their stats are represented by the same basic bars that appear everywhere else in the game. Therefore, drafting a guy is really only based on stats, which is less fun. Sure, it'll fill up your roster, but without some history and involvement, these players will seem like bots.   Trading, on the other hand, works very well. You have the ability to offer both players and picks in a trade, and trades can encompass several players at once. If a team doesn't like what you're offering, they'll either reject you flat out, or make a counter offer. This kind of give and take is great, and really adds to the feeling that you're the general manager (minus the salary, of course).   One last thing has to be mentioned here in terms of presentation: Visual Concepts has done a great job cutting down load times. The only time you even notice them is when you first boot up the system, and even then it's not too oppressive. It may seem like a little thing, but it's huge when you play multiple seasons.   Gameplay Gameplay is where it's at. It's what distances 2K2 from every other simulation basketball game on the market. That doesn't mean it's perfect... it just means 2K2 is the best. As with previous incarnations, this game does a whole lot right, but at times it will have you scratching your head. Gameplay sets 2K2 apart. But because we all expect so much from it, the problems are magnified.   The control scheme in the 2K series has always been fluid and intuitive, and that continues with this offering. As the old phrase goes, ~it's easy to pick up, but hard to put down.~ Great control is the foundation for a satisfying game. On offense, both directional and icon passing is offered, and both work well. Shooting, as always, is a matter of touch, but it's fairly easy to get a sense of within moments of picking up the controller. Mastering it is a different story. In addition to passing and shooting, there's the standard juke button (whose problems I've already touched on), and the ability to post up. This is perhaps the most helpful and best feeling part of the offensive game. There is no more fulfilling feeling in this game than backing your guy up under the basket, then spinning off of him and burying a dunk.   On defense, the controls are good, but harder to get a grip on. There are the standard buttons: blocking/jumping, attempting to steal, and changing players. Smartly, VC has included two options for this: you can either switch to the man closest the ball or the last player back. This is helpful when you notice your defense breaking down and need to quickly locate the player who can step in the lane and challenge the impending shot. Another helpful control is the defensive stance button, which will allow you, when pressed, to always face your opponent. It works well to keep all of the action in front of you, and also minimizes the risk of getting blown by. It's the defensive equivalent of posting up, and works quite well.  The other controls, for blocking and stealing, are a little slipperier. The jump/block button works well to defend jump shots, but is virtually powerless in close unless you line it up just right. An accurate alignment for a dunk is difficult to pull off, making defense near the rim pretty tough. It also takes a while to complete the jump animation, so it's tough to quickly land and go up again. If you even slightly mis-time a rebounding try or block attempt, your man will be woefully out of position. Stealing is kind of the same story. Unless you're in close, the steal animation will make your man lurch forward, giving the opposing player an opportunity to pass you. I wish there were a control that didn't require such a bold move, a simple swat or hand check. On defense, you never want to commit, and that's all the steal button will let you do.  In addition to basic, in game controls, 2K2 enables you to call plays on the fly. This is handled by flicking the right analog stick to bring up a small play menu. This menu is determined in the Coaching options, but the defaults are different for every team. On offense, you can call pick & rolls, isolation plays and motion offenses. Virtually any type of offensive play that you can think of can be selected here, and you'll have to master at least a few of them to compete against the stingy computer AI. The play-calling scheme is quick and easy, and simple to change. If you don't know what specific plays do, visit the Customize screen and select either Off or Def Plays, and you'll be treated to an animated diagram of how each should work. These advanced functions will certainly appeal to hardcore basketball gamers, and may serve to teach those eager to learn about b-ball the mechanics of play-calling.  On defense, play-calling enables you to set different formations and pressure schemes to contain squirrelly opposing offenses. Here, you'll be able to call a full-court press, intentional foul, traps and now, zone defenses. Since the zone became legal in the NBA this year, it hasn't been employed that much. But here it works to good effect. You'll notice opposing defenses going to it, too, if you're whooping up on them. As with offensive play calls, the defenses work well if you know what you're doing. You can get away with playing man-to-man all game (but you'll have to work harder to win), but it's nice to know you can take the reins if you need to.  The Coach options allow you to further tweak your offense and defense. Here, you can set specific pressure on individual players, choosing to play an extremely dangerous opponent tight, or even double team him. You can also set game tempo, and decide which areas of play-calling will be left to the CPU. All of this customization is great if you know what you're doing, but can be daunting if you're unfamiliar with the advanced mechanics of basketball. If you leave the play-calling and pressure up to the computer, however, you could be disappointed in the results. While it usually knows when to switch to full court pressure and intentional fouling, it won't always guard the lane effectively or manage the clock well. Several times, I had a fast break opportunity stymied simply because the CPU called a time out as I was passing up the court, and that's just wrong.  Speaking of the fast break, it's been fixed a bit since the Dreamcast. On that system, players tended to stop in their tracks to receive the ball, breaking the flow of the play. That's been fixed here, as a player can receive an over-the-shoulder pass in stride and drive to the hoop. It's still really tough to get a guy behind the defense for an easy bucket in these situations, though. That's a bummer, too, because the fast break is a key facet of many teams' offenses.  AI-wise, a lot of things have been tweaked in NBA 2K2, especially on the defensive side of the ball. As a result, scoring (on all difficulty settings besides Rookie) is a lot tougher than in years past. Defenders no longer stand aside and let you have the lane. You have to take it from them. In addition, the defense has grown quite a brain. If you keep going to the same guy in the paint, they'll begin to key on that and double up on him. Likewise, if you start hitting consistently from three-land, they'll start hassling you on the perimeter. It's great to see the D actually make adjustments as the game progresses. It allows for a lot more give-and-take in the game. If they take away the three, you'll have to get your inside game working. If they shut down a specific play call, you'll have to find another that works. The defense forces you to have to think to win, and that's a wonderful thing.  Unfortunately, in the same way that this is good, it can affect your enjoyment of the game. Since there are fewer wide-open looks and easy baskets, it is more difficult to go on runs. Therefore, if you are playing more up-tempo, pop-and-shoot ball, you may miss a couple of shots and find yourself in a hole. Playing defense against a computer opponent is harder than it needs to be, and it can be difficult to claw your way back into the game.  Why is this? Because most of the time, the computer shoots 70-80% on Pro (the default) or All-Star. This percentage can be cut into slightly by playing disciplined, patient defense, but disciplined, patient defense can get pretty old. The reason for the high shooting percentage is that on offense, the CPU AI does not miss shots unless you either get a hand in their face or actually block the attempt. If a player gets the ball in the paint, you might as well chalk up the score. If a player has an open jumper, he will hit it 99% of the time. This does not reflect true basketball, and can really tick you off, since on offense it's tough to get open looks, and even if you do, you'll brick a lot of shots. I have no problem with the computer shooting well, but 70% for the game is ridiculous. 100% on unchallenged shots is ludicrous. Even the best players in the NBA won't hit more than 80% of their open looks. And when challenged, they hit even less.  The effect that this high shooting percentage has on the game is that it makes you have to trade baskets with the computer. Therefore, you'll start resorting to the only thing that almost always works--backing down a player on the post up, spinning off and going for the dunk (the highest percentage shot around). Therefore, the game becomes a matter of who screws up first. Usually that's you. I consider myself a good sports gamer, and well versed in basketball, but when I first picked up the game, I lost the first 20 Pro contests I played. Part of it was that I try to play a more up-tempo game, and took a lot of chances, but even when I settled down, played tight defense and took them to the end of the shot clock on every possession, they still beat me. Maybe by only two or three, but they won nonetheless. Eventually I won through a combination of varied defensive pressure and clutch shooting, but I had to work pretty hard to get that result.   Rookie mode is a lot more forgiving, as you would expect. Opposing players actually miss shots, whether challenged or not. The computer controlled players on your team rebound, which is not very common on Pro unless you're in a zone defense. Free throws are easier to make. Steals don't result in fouls as often. But ultimately, Rookie is too easy. What would benefit this game immensely is a separate difficulty level between Rookie and Pro that would be the default. Another option would be to include slider bars that allow you to set passing and shooting accuracy, defensive aggressiveness and more. That way, if the AI is too difficult or easy to beat, you can tweak it yourself according to preference.  Overall, the gameplay is great. This is the best feeling basketball game around, and all of the adjustments they've made to older installments are quite welcome. To make it a truly great experience, though, there needs to be more balance. And when that piece falls into place, watch out!  Sound The sounds of basketball have been traditionally well-captured by the NBA 2K series. There are the required shoe squeaks, whistles and dribbling effects. These standard sounds are well done here, but I'd like to hear even more. I'd like to hear the excitement of the crowd build more during a game. As it stands, they cheer at about the same level throughout.  I also want to hear a little more chatter amongst players, a little more groaning when fouled. I'd like to hear the coach jawing at the referee. It's nice to hear him calling out encouragement from the bench, but this could be expanded even further. It might be cool to hear him suggesting offensive plays to run, or hollering at a player to post up or guard against the three.   Compared to the more complex and varied commentary of SEGA Sports' NFL 2K2, the play-by-play here is good, but not amazing. When it's the strongest is during replays, when the color guy gets to break down the play. The statements here are often insightful and realistic, and go well with the choice of replays. During game play, the comments are almost always valid and on cue, but they don't have the give and take of NFL 2K2, and they don't come as often. But that's comparing it to another SEGA Sports title. When you compare this commentary to the competition, it's simply the best.NBA 2K2 is an excellent basketball game that will get heavy rotation in my PS2's tray from now until next season. There's a lot of meat here, what with the defensive and offensive play calling, ability to set specific pressure, advanced post controls, and all the rest. The Franchise and Season modes offer nearly endless gameplay (especially considering that once I win the NBA crown with my ever-lovin' Bucks, I'm going to try to take home the trophy with the LA Clippers, a feat that could result in severe pad-thumb).  If you don't like the simulation-style game, switch to the Street game to play a more wide open brand of b-ball. There is a lot to do, and if you're a fan of basketball, you'll be doing it for a long time to come.As I stated right off the bat, this is the best basketball game to date on the system, and the series will only keep improving. As we inch ever closer to the perfect basketball experience, NBA 2K2 is leading the charge. Bottom line, this game will keep me warm for a year, but I can't wait for 2K3.", "date": "Jan 15, 2002"}
