Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/02/games-explosion-review", "text": "Bigger isn't always better, as is the case with Games Explosion! for the Game Boy Advance, a collection of 16 generally-mediocre clones of some of the greatest arcade and board games around. Games included are variations on Pong, Sudoku, tic-tac-toe, checkers, Mastermind, Tapper, Sokoban, Buster Bros., Pipe Dreams, Space Invaders, Blackjack, bowling, darts and a few semi-original games. But nearly every decision made on the part of the developer, from controls to menus, music and graphics falls flat, sucking all the fun out of these normally enjoyable game designs.    The first challenge the title provides is actually finding each game. The menus are very confusing for a collection aimed at casual gamers. Rather than all games being offered in a single-screen list, they're divided into subsets of 2-4 games each with abstract category names like ~Neon,~ ~Cyber~ and ~Zap.~ Try to guess which one Pong is under.    Artistically, the game has no idea what it wants to be. The menus feature a happy penguin and bright, colorful backgrounds that might appeal to 3-year-olds. The games themselves however sport a dark, murky, futuristic art style, complete with illegible, futuristic fonts (yes, even in Blackjack). Navigating through the menus should be easy, but the developers require players to press left and right to move the selection orbs up and down, and navigate through a barrage of text options prior to each game.    There are art-free tutorial screens for each game that really don't explain the games well and are filled with confusing grammatical errors. Sound and music can be turned on or off (but not turned down) and for some reason the developers decided to make game's credits unskippable, so be sure not to select that feature by accident.    As for the games themselves, they're a mixed bag. Many, like checkers, Sudoku and Mastermind are worth playing in spite of their poor representation here, because they're pretty fun regardless of interpretation. Others are just plain awful. Each game has three difficulty settings, which only seems to affect some of the games. Many of them, like the Sokoban clone generate the exact same puzzles regardless of which difficulty is selected. The challenge is also unbalanced; In the Pong clone, the easiest setting has the opponent paddle missing almost every shot, even when it starts with the ball. And while tic-tac-toe is hardly a complicated game, the highest difficulty setting forces a draw every time, so what's the point of playing?    There's also very little charm in these games. In checkers, the opponent's pieces snap to their position immediately, regardless of how many of the player's pieces are jumped. This can be confusing as it's sometimes difficult to tell exactly what move just occurred. And in the Mastermind clone, the correct colors aren't revealed if the game isn't won (that's just mean).       Sudoku will be one of the points of interest for anyone considering this collection. While that game isn't awful here, it's hardly well-developed either. Numbers are placed with the A button and removed with the B button, while the L and R buttons move between the available numbers for selection. There's no way to leave hints or possible numbers, and there's an overbearing feature that points out any obvious errors as soon as a number is placed. This cannot be turned off, regardless of the difficulty setting and destroys much of the game's challenge. There is a timer ticking away that records how long each puzzle takes, but there is no time penalty (ala Brain Age) for placing numbers incorrectly.    Another thing disappointing in this collection is how isolated each type of game is. There are only two board games - versions of Mastermind and checkers - but no chess or backgammon. And since Blackjack was already included, one would assume poker would've been a simple addition, too. I was excited to see there's an original game in the style of Beatmania, until I found that it's pretty unplayable. Notes fly across the screen and players must key in a 2-button combo (such as the R button then left) to erase the note. If a note is missed, it can be keyed in further down the screen. These original games make my head hurt, because the developers obviously set rules and methods of play, but none of them make any sense.    One thing I do appreciate is that some pretty classic and less-often cloned games make an appearance here. The arcade classic Buster Bros. is redone pretty well, although the ball physics aren't very convincing. Likewise the Sokoban-inspired game works well, and even sports a little sprite rotation. Space Invaders is remade with a mix of retro sprites, high-res backgrounds and stars that fly at the screen through Z-space. Unfortunately, most of the other games are lacking this level of presentation.    The arcade classic Tapper (known to most as Rootbeer Tapper) gets absolutely butchered in just about every regard. The cheerful bartender is replaced by an alien serving pizza to robots (lame), players don't have to wait before serving a pizza down the table (lame), and worst of all, negative powerups spring up that players can't avoid (super lame). These icons slow the alien down and have other adverse effects, all unavoidable because they're in the path of waiting customers.    From start to finish, it's obvious that the developers have no clue about what makes solid gameplay. Every deviation from the classic game designs is a wrong one, and many of the games are either unplayable or unenjoyable. There's no consistent art direction, the music doesn't match the visual or gameplay themes (why does it sound Asian when everything looks futuristic?) and the presentation confuses and blows.    There are a few games in the bunch I actually enjoyed. MC Rudolf has a cute Megaman style to it and involves jumping a robot up a vertically-scrolling environment, doing Mario-style spins to gain extra height. Powerups here make sense and either speed the robot up, freeze him in place or maddeningly switch the horizontal controls. Whoever designed this game obviously had some fun with it. It's just a shame there aren't more like it.   Games Explosion! is more like a dud. The presentation on the games is lacking and the developer's take on each classic design ranges from just okay to bad. They made some interesting choices in selecting which games to clone, especially with the inclusion of Buster Bros and Sokoban. But there's a lot of obvious omissions like chess and poker as well. There's no denying that sixteen games for the price of one is a deal, but when most of the games are forgettable and poorly-constructed, it still doesn't add up to $15 worth of gaming.", "date": "Nov 2, 2006"}
