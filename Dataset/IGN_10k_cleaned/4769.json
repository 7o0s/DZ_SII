Starring the Dogg as the boss boxer in this bizarro world that parodies every rapper from Heavy D to vanilla Ice to 50-Cent.   Features:   Arcade-style boxing  Fight multiple opponents  Take on the Dogg himself   Snoop Dogg Boxing will quickly remind gamers of the seminal Nintendo boxing game, Punch-Out!, but with slightly simplified controls and even more simplified graphics. It's a quick game, suited perfectly for five minute gaming sessions, as the title allows you to save between rounds. If you only have enough time to bash in Miami Ice's peroxide'd mug before moving on the D-Flex, just put the championship into temporary stasis.   Controls are easy to master, as this is a rock 'em-sock 'em style game. Pressing belivers a high punch, while jamming down on the touchpad delivers a body blow. Press left and right to dance, dodging shots, but if you really wanna clean some clocks, double-tap in either direction to throw out a wicked hook.   Snoop Dogg Boxing succeeds for a few reasons. One, it's a fast-moving game. There is no clunky response time. You press up to punch, and your boxer's arm goes flying immediately. And your opponents, who get progressively smarter, react fairly to your shots. If you catch them off-guard, you can deliver a series of devastating punches, effectively halving their health bars.   The game is not best-looking handset title to come through IGN offices, but there are several small touches that we certainly appreciate. For one thing, all of the rapper parodies are good and obvious. For example, Miami Ice possesses the silly hair and face of has-been Vanilla Ice. And the animations are good. When we delivered a body blow to tubby D-Flex, his face puffed up and his eyes bugged out. Little things like that don't take that long to program, but they sure go a long way.   Snoop Dogg Boxing also employs MIDI-ish takes on Snoop Dogg songs between rounds. Hardly dead ringers for the real thing, but any fan will quickly ID the music.Snoop Dogg Boxing is a great pop-culture goof that makes excellent use of its source material -- all things Snoop -- and grafts it onto a solid game engine. This wasn't just a cheap, hackjob way to use Snoop's music and likeness. Snoop Dogg Boxing is a complete boxing game that will entertain handset gamers for some time, as they work their way up the ranks to take on the Dogg.", "date": "Jun 11, 2004"}
