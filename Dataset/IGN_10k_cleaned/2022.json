A bad action game, a bad racing game, a bad fighting game, it's still often possible to still have a little dumb, mindless fun with one, but a bad RPG is nothing but pain.  It's slow, tedious, and repetitive, but without all the positive qualities that balance those out in the better specimens of the genre.  Games like Legend of Dragoon and Shadow Madness rank among the worst of the previous generation, regardless of genre.   Add to the hallowed halls of RPG heck Ephemeral Fantasia (stick ~Reiselied~ in front of that to get the original Japanese title), a game which inspires interest only insofar as it makes me wonder who it was at Konami that decided to green-light its American release.  Reiselied is powered by an extremely questionable graphics engine and extremely poor memory management routines.  If there's anything interesting to do here, you'll probably be dead sick of the loading screens well before you get a chance to do it.   Gameplay  To lead things on a more positive note, Ephemeral Fantasia does have a well-made combat system, presenting real-time battles in 3D and adding a positioning system that takes advantage of the 3D field. Party members and enemies are randomly assigned to different positions around the battlefield, giving them varying advantages and disadvantages depending on their relationship.  Battles move very quickly, there are a great many different attack animations (SaGa Frontier-style, you learn new attacks automatically as time progresses), and lots of sweeping camera motions add to the excitement of combat.    The game loses much of its appeal when you're not fighting, though.  Ephemeral Fantasia loads.  It loads a lot.  It loads early, and it loads often.  The towns and dungeons, none of which involve an unduly significant quantity of textures, architecture, and character dialogue, are divided into little sectors that will load every minute or so providing you trot through them at a decent clip.  Maneuvering near the borders of the load zones and trying to find something there might sock you with loads seconds apart.  Want to walk around town and kill some time?  Soon enough you'll prefer to just sit tight and stare at your watch, since your average afternoon constitutional will be interrupted by around half a dozen trips into limbo.  These loads are not just brief blips.  The game actually switches over to the black ~NOW LOADING~ screen and sits there for a good several seconds before returning control to your hands.   The aggravating thing about that is the amount of time the game seems to expect you will simply want to kill.  The event progression system is based on the clock, which moves in an accelerated version of real time, and story events are frequently assigned to a specific time.  Thus, instead of going somewhere or chatting with somebody in order to hit the next little plot flag, you just have to sit and wait, or head for one of the spots where you can rest and advance the clock.  This, then, is a very slow specimen of a genre that isn't renowned for moving all that fast to begin with.  Even the vaunted Guitar Freaks mini-game can't breathe much life into it, since it appears so infrequently amid cinemas full of dull dialogue and predictable story portents (none of them translated with any particular flair -- and who thought naming the female lead ~Rummy~ was a good idea?).    Graphics  Reiselied was either a Dreamcast or a Nintendo 64 project at its inception, depending on who you ask.  Either way, though, it's fairly clear that the graphics engine isn't taxing the hardware too badly.  The characters are smooth, but low-detail 3D realizations of fairly simple 2D designs, and they're animated primarily with simple, stiff motions.  Collision detection glitches occur frequently around joints, hair, and clothing in cinematic sequences, which is odd considering how fluid some of the combat animations are (Rummy's character model even features the Bounce).   The game's realtime lighting is another spot where errors frequently occur -- it's strange to walk around a dungeon and see the lighting on walls actually increase as the character moves his little torch-lit halo away from them.  It's too bad, since that's the one concession towards making the world look a little bit less bland.  Unfortunately, that's more or less a uniform description of Reiselied's looks: very bland indeed.   Sound  The soundtrack, on the other hand, is strangely eclectic, rotating between ambient outdoor sounds, light guitars evidently inspired by lead character Mouse's personal compositions, and the expected heavy orchestral sorts of tunes (particularly in battle).  The guitar mini-game tunes aren't in the same league as ~Happy Man,~ but neither are they objectionably weak, and even a basic song is fun when you're playing it yourself . This is nothing you'd want to buy the soundtrack album to, but it's at least not an actively depressing accompaniment.There are bad games that anger me, and then there are bad games that just confuse me.  Ephemeral Fantasia belongs in the latter column.  Exactly who decided to make this game, how did it get made, and to top it all of, why did it come to the United States?  If KCEJ East wanted one of its projects brought over here, why not Seven Blades, which at least had decent looks and a lot of blood going for it?  It's arguably an even poorer effort than Orphen, although it does have the advantage of a cast that is simply dull, rather than actively hateful.  Oh, well.  I'll slide this one in the drawer and forget about it, while most of you shouldn't even give it that much attention.", "date": "Jul 13, 2001"}
