A superior point-and-click title has an engaging, well-written story, a simple control system, good voice acting and graphics and lots of puzzles that are not too difficult, too easy or take players out of the story by being pointless.  Sounds simple, right?  Well, it must not be with so many developers rarely finding that winning combination.   Keepsake, from developer Wicked Studios and publisher The Adventure Company, is great in many regards.  The development team hit the nail on the head with so many aspects that it is surprising Keepsake, in the end, doesn't quite make the cut.  This is due to the fact that it feels like two completely different games, one great and one not.  The first half is well-written with great puzzles.  When I was near the end of the first half, I actually thought I was almost done with the game entirely.  However, I wasn't.  There was an entire second half to go and what I found there included impossibly difficult puzzles that didn't make sense most of the time.  By the time I was 3/4 into Keepsake, I was just annoyed, but I wanted to see the ending so I persevered.  And as good as the ending is, I was far too frustrated with the puzzles and other problems in the second half of the game to really care all that much.  Keepsake is a great example of a game that if you only play halfway through, you will probably love it.  If you play it all the way through, well, you will use the hint system a lot just to get to the end.    The story is fantastic.  The game begins as Lydia, the protagonist, arrives at a school of magic where she is to begin her training.  She has spent years saving up enough money to join her best friend, Celeste, at the school.  She cannot wait to see her best friend again.  However, when Lydia arrives and finds a way into the school, it is eerily quiet and, as it turns out, abandoned.  She happens upon Zak, a young wolf who claims he is actually a dragon, locked in a cupboard and he becomes her companion for the rest of the journey.  The entire game takes place in the school's lower and upper levels and the forest and gardens outside the school.  It's actually a small environment for an adventure game, basically just school grounds, but there are so many rooms and locations to wander that the setting feels bigger than it is.   Puzzles are plentiful.  These aren't the 'combine object a in inventory with object b', but instead honest to goodness puzzles.  I'm a big fan of puzzles, so this is a definite plus.  Types include solving riddles, gear puzzles, chess style puzzles and more.  Some of them are incredibly enjoyable and might even be worth revisiting.  Too bad there isn't a way to do that without loading an early save or replaying the game in its entirety.  On the flip side, some of the puzzles in the second half are horrible and annoying.  I still don't really understand the solution to the astronomy puzzle.  Riddles are another point of contention.  I know this game was translated from another language so it is possible the riddles lost something in their translation, but the answers to the riddles really make little sense.  This is the only thing that possibly shows a problem with the translation though, so maybe they make as little sense in the original language as they do in English.   Keepsake's controls are simple.  All actions are taken with the mouse.  Point, left click.  There is a basic menu/inventory system that can be accessed on-screen.  The only reason to visit the inventory screens, though, is to re-read an item that was collected earlier in the game or to see the grayed out items that still need to be found.  The inventory does show every object that will be available, so there are no random 'trying to find a weird object that might fit a puzzle' problems.  This might sound like it makes the game too easy, but because the environments are huge and there are a lot of rooms to search through, it's actually very much appreciated.  Saving a game is also done from this menu system, and I would certainly suggest saving often, especially after you beat a particularly difficult puzzle.  Game crashes can occur, one happened to me and I lost six hours of gameplay due to it (thank goodness for the hint system, which I'll go into in a moment).   When I say I lost six hours of gameplay, this was actually just a small chunk of the game.  Keepsake is long.  Perhaps not The Longest Journey long, but it's certainly the longest adventure title I've played since The Longest Journey.  While abundant gameplay is great, and Keepsake certainly has a lot of gameplay, part of the reason for its longevity is pointless backtracking.  The environments are massive, epic almost.  Entering the grand hall feels a lot like entering a grand hall should.  The school is actually laid out well, so finding ways around the school in the first half of the game becomes intuitive pretty quickly.  There won't be a lot of referring to the in-game map.  This is another example, though, of how the second half of the game fails.  Once players move out of the first half, the school on the ground levels, and gain access to the upper levels, it quickly becomes convoluted.  Getting around in upper levels is done via portals.  I don't want to give too much away, because portals themselves are a puzzle, but getting around the upper levels even after figuring out the puzzle of the portals, becomes tiresome; especially with one particular puzzle that has one piece in one location and another in a different location that requires no less than three portal jumps to go between.  If the player understand the puzzle right off the bat, it will take four back and forth's to solve the puzzle.  In my case, I didn't understand the rules until I asked for hints, and being stubborn, I didn't want to ask for hints, so I went back and forth probably 20 times before finally breaking down and then it took me another four times to solve it.  Yeah, that took me a long time.      That brings me to a really well implemented system in the game, without which I probably would have quit or resorted to an out-of-game walkthrough to complete the second half.  This system is the hint system.  If a player is stuck and doesn't know where to go, simply getting a hint will tell them the next location.  If a puzzle is a real stumper, the hint system will offer up to three hints to solve the puzzle THEN solve it if requested.  Yes, puzzles can be altogether skipped if they are proving to be too hard.  Obviously, I loved this feature when I lost six hours, since I didn't have to go through solving the puzzles again, one of which was *really* hard and took a *really* long time to solve.  Without it, though, the second half is impossible to figure out.  Some of the puzzles' rules in the upper levels can't be deciphered through trying to solve it, so the hint system will reveal the rules.  Sometimes it took all three hints to truly understand what I was supposed to do.   On the flip side, there was only one puzzle in the lower levels that I used the hint system with (the aforementioned riddles).  I also never used the hint system in the first half to understand what I was supposed to do next.  I always knew from the context of the game.  In the second half, this was rarely the case.    The graphics are really beautiful.  The environments are well rendered, with close-up objects being nicely detailed and far-away visuals taking on a blurring effect.  The characters are believable looking, no abnormal proportions or excess skin.  The animations are generally very well done, but there's a minor problem when fast forwarding through text that has animations associated with it.  Even if the text is skipped, it doesn't move onto the next part until the animation for that speech is completed, which means watching Lydia (usually) talking without any sound coming out of her.  I really liked the special cutscenes -- Lydia's visions.  There is a special browning effect that really adds to sense of it being a vision.   The sounds are generally good.  At first, I had a hard time with Zak's immature sounding voice.  He is supposed to be a dragon after all.  It all makes sense later though.  Lydia's voice, which is the one you'll hear the most, is really good.  The actress who plays Lydia has a good grasp of her and voiced her appropriately.  There were only two voices I could really find fault with.  The merchant sounds ridiculous, lending an Italian accent that sounds fake.  I could do a better Italian accent and it should be mentioned I stink at accents.  Celeste's father Nathaniel is the other voice that is annoying.  He talks really ..  slowly .   even when it feels like his speech should be rushed given the nature of the situation.  No one ever talks that calmly all the time, especially considering the events that take place in the game.  As far as gripes go, those two with the sound are pretty minor - the sound is actually very well done, including good music and sound effects.   There was one really odd minor problem with the game.  Periodically, it would minimize for no apparent reason.  This didn't affect gameplay, just meant I had to click to maximize it again so I could see what is going on, but I found it odd nonetheless that it would do this pretty regularly.  So, where does all that leave Keepsake?  Well, it has a fantastic story with an ending that is somewhat surprising.  It has good controls (really hard to mess that up though).  The graphics are beautiful and I generally liked the sounds.  Some of the puzzles are really fun.  That all sounds so good, it should be a superior product as such.  However, that isn't the case at all.  If they ended the game at the lower levels, it would have gotten a much better review.  The second half of the game really drags it down.  The puzzles in the upper levels are more often than not just frustrating or make absolutely no sense.  The portal travel gets ridiculous at points.  If it weren't for those two (pretty major) points, the game would be a must buy.  I want to say buy it because the first half is a sheer joy to play, but it is hard to recommend something when I know you'll want to find out how it ends and getting to the end point might just be more than you can bear.  Of course, you can use the hint system to fast forward through it.", "date": "May 3, 2006"}
