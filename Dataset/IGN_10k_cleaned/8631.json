Both Totally Spies and Code Lyoko originate in France and have since become major hits in the US. The latter of the two has recently been given the video game treatment on the Nintendo DS, thanks to DC Studios. The game, much like the show did with animation, attempts to change up how things are done and offer a unique vision. It's different for sure, and even kind of fun, but it's not necessarily fun for anyone that doesn't still watch cartoons after coming home from school.    Code Lyoko is a series that follows five friends as they try to save the virtual word they discovered, Lyoko, from being destroyed by the evil X.A.N.A. Ulrich, Odd, Jeremy and Yumi try to balance school and social lives while having to travel to Lyoko and help their virtual friend Aelita fend off X.A.N.A.s forces. The game, like the show, follows both aspects of the kids' lives. It's broken up into 15 chapters, with each chapter acting like an episode from the show. In fact the stories are taken directly from the show, sometimes with cut scenes from the accompanying episode.    The everyday lives in the real world are presented as a point and click adventure game. Players guide one of the teens around the school or nearby town, talking to people and collecting objects. All the characters are 2D sprites, like the real life portion of the show. It's really just used as a setup for the story before the game switches to Lyoko. It's a shame that the developers missed an opportunity to provide a solid adventure game on a system in desperate need of more. The adventure portions hold the player's hand, constantly displaying a map telling them exactly where to go. The only difficulty this section of the game provides is caused by the map not being displayed in the same direction as the game screen. Moving left on the game screen is up on the map, which is incredibly frustrating.    The adventure portion quickly leads into a journey to Lyoko, which is where all the action is, as well as a switch from 2D to 3D. The game switches from adventure game to run-and-gun when the teens virtualize. Each character gains abilities and fighting moves and most of the levels will require players to switch between them to use their unique abilities. Battling in Lyoko is the best part of the game, and every character controls differently. Ulrich is a sword wielding melee character, while Odd is strictly range combat. Yumi offers a balance between the two, and Aelita is just a defensive character. Every character has his or her strengths and is more effective than the others against certain enemies. The fights require a hefty amount of skill to not get blasted away, especially in the later levels when some pretty wicked monsters come into play.    Unfortunately, besides the battling, the rest of Lyoko is pretty linear and tame. The levels are giant floating platforms, and there is usually only one way to go. Any path that diverges just takes the player to some items. Lyoko is a cool world, and exploring it would have been fun. Instead players are forced to follow the one path to the end of the tower. The levels also suffer from a sometimes wonky camera that can't be controlled. It turns when the path does, sometimes causing the character to list to the side, and on the many narrow pathways this is a dangerous thing. It's especially awkward when players have to backtrack as the camera doesn't often move behind the character so players are running blind.       Sometimes while in Lyoko the character will race through the virtual world on a vehicle dodging obstacles and collecting items. These levels are all right as a change of pace, but they aren't fun enough to warrant a lot of playtime, so it's thankful that they don't even show up until halfway through the game.    For a game about a kid's show, Code Lyoko is surprisingly long. Each of the 15 chapters has an adventure game portion, a Lyoko action portion, and even a couple simple puzzles to solve. The game gives the option to save after each chapter and in between the adventure mode and Lyoko levels. Unfortunately, after players destroy the tower in Lyoko, the game just jumps to the next chapter. There's isn't a wrap-up segment or anything to give closure. Unless players are familiar with the show, the story will seem choppy and confusing. Code Lyoko does a few major things right. It's a lengthy title that accurately depicts the show it's based on. It also offers separate styles of the game that give a good feel of how the show plays out. Unfortunately both modes of the game have some issues, and they practically guide the player through the game. In contrast, the often difficult fight portions seem overly tough compared to the relative ease of the rest of the game. Code Lyoko is great for fans of the show, since the stories are taken right from it, but for everyone else that isn't familiar with the cartoon it may not be wise for them to virtualize.", "date": "Jun 13, 2007"}
