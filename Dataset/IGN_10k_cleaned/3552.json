Konami Europe decided to delve into the relatively unexplored area of casino management in their latest effort, Casino Inc., which puts players in charge of their very own casino; with the ability to manage several casinos within the city at once, players get a real sense of the casino life during the 1970s.  By combining a cartoon like theme along with mature content, Casino Inc. succeeds on delivering on several levels; comic relief mixed with serious issues makes for one fun game.  Ladies and gentlemen, let's build a casino.   The game's high production values are immediately apparent through the highly polished menus and pre rendered movies before and throughout the game.  Upon completion of various tasks players are rewarded with little movies that are usually funny in nature.  But before anyone jumps right into the game it's highly advisable to take the game's extremely helpful and well designed tutorial.  The tutorials cover every aspect of the game including building gambling attractions, hiring staff, arranging transportation to your casino, buying real estate and advertising, and even hiring cheats and troublemakers to cause mayhem in your rivals' casinos.  Once you've learned the basic idea of managing a casino, you can jump right in.   There are three cities that the player can choose to build casinos in:  Little Hope Springs, Fortune Falls, and Chancersville.  Hope Springs offers the player the least amount of difficulty in regards to competition and all around complexity in managing the casino.  Chancersville offers the greatest challenge of all, keeping the players on their toes at all times.     The basic idea of Casino Inc. is to build a casino that is far superior to all your competitors, while at the same time doing your best to drive them out of business.  This is the '70s folks, a time where Mob Rule dictated how casinos were run.  There is no Mr. Nice Guy.  It's your job to make sure your casino is the best of the best, and if that means sending cheating players to steal from  your competitors, or hiring muscle to go pound on guests in competing casinos, then that's what is going to have to be done.  The game revolves a fair amount around the reputation that you earn throughout the town.  If your floormen are blind and cheating is tolerated, the town will know, and cheaters will be flocking to your casino.  If your security is lax and fights are constantly taking place, your casino will attract the trash of the town, causing a disturbance to your other loyal patrons.    All this would be dull had the developers not taken the time to ensure that every aspect of this management was fun.  If a floorman spots someone cheating you will be notified, and can take several courses of action.  You may choose to have your security guard simply escort the cheater off the premises, or you can have your bouncer ~discipline~ the cheater, thereby taking them to the basement and kicking the crap out of them.  This game makes no effort to sugarcoat anything, including the escorts that you can hire for the lonely businessmen visiting for the weekend.  However, if your employees feel like they're unappreciated, they may begin to demand a pay raise, or even in an extreme situation, begin to steal from you.  Well, we know what the bouncer might have to say about that   Managing a casino can't always be fun.  The powers to be want to ensure that everything is running smoothly so they can still make their house payments and government kickbacks.  You need to make your casino unique - stand out from the rest - and make sure people are visiting you and not the competition.  While all this micromanagement could prove to be a curse in an otherwise polished game, the developers managed to integrate a very helpful interface that makes organizing every aspect of the game quite simple.  If at any time you are required to quickly find a bouncer, simply click on the ~find nearest employee~ icon on the side and there he'll be.  The controls take about an hour to master, and after that, it's a breeze to navigate the menus.     It's imperative to have a good staff on hand, because sometimes people just don't want to co-operate.  Take for example the 3rd floor of my casino earlier today.  Two hooligans were giving a dealer a tough time at the blackjack tables.  The tension was growing and finally amounted in a fistfight between the dealer and the two ruffians.  After alerting the bouncers of the disturbance they were escorted to the basement where they promptly received a beating with a crowbar.  After lying unconscious on the floor for several minutes, they both offered their services to the casino.  They offered to travel to competing casinos to aggravate patrons in the hopes of driving them to a friendlier environment, like, say, my casino.     The game is constantly prompting the player with new challenges to ensure that one never gets bored and always has something to do.  For example, several hours into the game, the player is required to obtain a 64% market share of casino attendance in the city.  In order to accomplish this you must make your casino more appealing than the rest by having unique themes and a friendly staff.  This might mean forking out the extra cash for a ~5-Star~ staff, but in the end, it's worthwhile.  While the most expensive employees may take a bigger bite out of the casino's earnings, generally they are more effective in making patrons happy and keeping the casino running smoothly.  Even if they become unhappy and demand a pay raise, the effect it will have on the casino's earnings in minimal:  you'll be making so much money from the increased gambling traffic that you'll be more than happy to give your hookers a 100% raise.  Hey, they're worth it.      Once your casino is booming with business it might be time to buy up some real estate and start up another one!  Just think, by slowly creating a monopoly in the city, ultimately everyone will be dumping their change into your pockets.  One great thing about Casino Inc. is the ability to leave the casino at any time and cruise the streets from a bird' eye view.  Once outside the casino you can see where people are heading, which casinos are popular, and if you choose, what the competitors are doing to attract the crowds.  Whenever you feel like it you can simply click on another casino and take a look around.  This is especially important when you send your cheats and troublemakers in to start a ruckus.     The game keeps good track of people's emotions and constantly apprises the players with the wants and needs of the casino's guests.  Whether it be their want for food, sleep, or sex, meeting these needs is only a few clicks away due to the extremely user friendly interface.  For example, a senior citizen wandering the casino may show an icon above his head that suggests he'd like to see a movie.  After he finds his way to the movie theatre, you need to ensure that the theatre is catering to his tastes:  the older folks like the musicals, teens love action movies, and couples enjoy comedies.     There is just a lot of fun to be had in this game, and more often than not you'll find yourself laughing at the strangest situations.  For example, there was a situation where my floorman confronted a cheater and the accused pulled out a gun and shot my floorman dead.  The shooter fled the scene and within moments the police showed and temporarily shut the casino down while the conducted an investigation.  The normal casino ambience changed to that of police radio chatter and sirens.  The whole incident severely hampered business and I was forced to higher a new floorman.  What an inconvenience it was!     There was another instance in which one man was feeling quite ill and was vomiting all over the craps table.  I clicked on my security guard and ordered him to attack the man.  My intent was to simply knock some sense into him with the guard's baton.  But no, the guard decided to forfeit foresight altogether, pulled out his 9mm pistol and shot the man in the head.  The police were all over that in a matter of minutes.  The guard was arrested, and my staff was extremely unhappy.  An hour later the entire staff quit because they didn't feel like they were working in a so called ~safe-environment~.  Go figure.    The graphics in Casino Inc. are far from revolutionary, yet still pleasing to the eye.  Instead of trying to portray a realistic theme the developers decided to make characters cartoon-like in nature.  This allows from some pretty funny player animations and sounds.  The players are well rendered in 3D and look fairly decent up close.  The camera can easily be rotated a full 360 degrees enabling the player to get a closer or better look at all the action.  The game supports resolutions up to 1600X1200 making for one sharp looking game, provided you have the computer to handle it.  The colors are vibrant and textures are well detailed.     There is good overall ambience in the casino at most times, with the ringing of winning slot machines, the happy cries of winning gamblers, and the gripes of the losing ones.  There is a good variety of speech bytes that characters mutter.  However, sometimes for several minutes at a time everyone decides to say the same thing over and over.  For a solid ten minutes people kept saying ~How many kids should we have?~ and ~I'm a winner!~ over and over and over again.  This eventually passes but you may find yourself turning down the speech temporarily because it can become frustrating.  The music is similar to that of Sim City 4, with a cross between classical and new age.  The appropriateness of this choice in music is questionable, but it enables the player to feel a little calmer in an otherwise stressful gaming environment.     After several hours of playing the game, opening up new casinos, and giving the competition a run for its money, the game begins to get a little stale.  Don't get me wrong, there's still a lot of fun to be had, but a game can only be so deep.  The additional difficulty levels are nice, but they really don't change the dynamic of the game enough to keep everything lasting a whole lot longer.     What did you think of Casino Inc?   Casino Inc. successfully delves into the unknown waters of corrupt casino management and delivers in every way possible.  Combining solid graphics, entertaining gameplay, comic relief, and good sense that you're really running a casino, there really isn't much more the game could do.  On the other hand, the game doesn't really offer anything significantly substantial or revolutionary to the ~tycoon~ genre, and a lack of multiplayer hinders replayability slightly.  All in all, Casino Inc. is an entertaining game that is worth a try if you're in the mood for a few laughs and a chance to run a casino the way you want to.  Check this one out.At first I was a little skeptical about a game that promised a mature theme to a tycoon type game, for in the past it hasnt always worked out.  But as the developers implemented a comedic approach to the game, the result was a swift execution of a solid idea.  While the game may grow old after a little while, there is still a solid amount to keep you coming back for more, and incentives to make your casino empire flourish.", "date": "Apr 1, 2003"}
