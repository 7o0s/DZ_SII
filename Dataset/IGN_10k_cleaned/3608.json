His PlayStation 2 adventure was awful, but his Game Boy Advance romp was a surprise.  Is his cellphone adventure, which is on a platform more in tune with the GBA than the PS2, worth the time and green to download on to your celly? Features: High score table  Space Escape follows Stitch's flight from his alien homeworld.  The multi-appendaged beast is at the controls of his little red space cruiser, and he must successfully avoid the armada of police ships that are trying to capture him.  What better place to hide than an asteroid field?  The game has several stages, but all take place in the asteroid field.  The first two levels put two police craft in hot pursuit, and Stitch must somehow get those ships to steer into the slowly rotating space rocks.  Stitch's craft is equipped with a cannon, but he can only use it to blast asteroids.  So, instead he must use the predictable pursuit patterns to fool a police ship into following Stitch into a rock.  After these pursuit stages, Stitch must successfully navigate the asteroid field on his own, without the po-po on his tail.  This is when Stitch really gets to use his cannon.  Stitch takes damage every time an asteroid or police cruiser bumps him, so keep an eye out for golden wrenches that float through the cosmos.  Pick them up to lower your damage meter.  Tiny red ships are also spotted from time to time--snag them for extra lives.  Not like you'll really want them, as extra lives would prolong this painful experience.  You see, Space Escape is un-fun.  The kind of un-fun you'd wish on a misbehaving child.  The controls are so awful, it almost renders the game unplayable.  You actually have to keep tapping the control stick or touch pad in the direction you want your ship to fly--you cannot hold it down.  This is absolutely nonsensical, and it makes controlling the game a pain.  Almost as discouraging is the game's deliriously bad collision detection.  Apparently, every asteroid or police cruiser has an invisible forcefield that extends several pixels in every direction.  There are no such things as near-misses in Space Escape, as just being in the general vicinity of an obstacle damages you.  You'll want to throw the control to the ground in frustration, but since that would mean throwing your phone, keep that temper in check.  Space Escape, however, looks fairly decent.  It's colorful, the sprites are sufficiently detailed, and there are several different breeds of asteroid.  Stitch's craft looks pretty close to the one he piloted in the movie.  And the opening menu screen makes it easy to find the info you need about the game, such as high score or control options.  Sound-wise, Space Escape is lacking. There is no theme playing during the game, just the occasional crash when you run into a ship or asteroid, or a sampled cannon shot that may or may not have come from the movie.  Other than that, space is still a pretty quiet place.Lilo & Stitch: The Movie is fun.  The game is most certainly not.  What could have been a fun little space blaster is completely ruined by sorry controls and pitiful collision detection--two things that must be dead-on for a shooter to succeed.  Hell, for any game to succeed.  If you absolutely must play Stitch on the run, check out his GBA game--which plays a lot like Metal Slug.  This wireless game is a dud through and through.", "date": "Apr 21, 2003"}
