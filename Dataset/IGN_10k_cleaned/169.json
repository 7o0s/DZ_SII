{"name": "Force 21", "name_review": "Force 21", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/08/19/force-21-2", "text": "So almost all RTS games are going 3D now. We'll soon be ready to give the old heave ho to our sprite based forbears and, as the novelty of 3D begins to wane, the real success of a game will have to be founded on either gameplay principles or some other techy, flashy innovation. In the case of Force 21, an admittedly beautiful 3D RTS title, the graphics support some pretty interesting innovations in gameplay and concept. With an emphasis on realism and action, Force 21raises the bar for immersion and involvement in wargames. All this is rendered against the backdrop of a war between China and the US in the year 2015. The overall campaign story and concept is, like the rest of the game, one possible, but logical, continuation of current political and military realities.  The consultant for the game, Gen. Franks, has an interesting history with the US military. He's headed up TRADOC, the institution responsible for extrapolating from today's technology and tactics, what the future of land war will be. Force XXI, in real life, is the Army's attempt to integrate the advances in technology and communication onto the battlefield. The future of warfare, according to TRADOC and Force XXI doctrine, is versatility. Instead of individual uniform platoons of tanks, helicopters, etc., platoons of the future will exhibit a heterogeneous composition. Despite this notion, most of the platoons in Force 21 seem to be composed of similar units. Later in the game, you get a better mix, but platoons are still pretty uniform. Each platoon (you can control up to 16 in each mission) is composed of up to five units. The composition of the platoons is pre-scripted so you won't get a chance to try your own combinations.  There are 42 units in the game, and the Chinese get the worst of it. Of the 42 units in the game only 17 of them serve the PLA. That means, ultimately, that you'll get less variety of stuff to play with as the Chinese, but their equipment can still stand up the Yanks. The units are divided into two main areas--combat and support. Combat vehicles include both tanks and mechanized fighting vehicles (MFVs) These two groups will do the majority of the actual fighting for you. The tanks are good for quick punches where brute force is needed. The MFVs are faster but weaker than the tanks and are best used for fixing attacks. Once they've got an enemy engaged, it's time to move the tanks in and finish them off. My big issue with all this is that the tanks are often the slowest units on the field and they frequently fall behind other platoons. I wish a way to group the separate platoons to move together had been included.  The light wheeled vehicles (LWVs) are supposed to be used primarily for scouting and surveillance tasks, but you'll find, as I did, that TOW equipped vehicles are perfect tank killers. They have a high detection range and nasty, nasty missiles. A few electronic warfare (EW) vehicles are included, but their manipulation of communications and radar doesn't seem to be a huge part of the game. Engineer units fill a support role with their ability to lay bridges, mines and build defense works. The handful of Logistic vehicles in the game have some movement support functions but, as they are completely unarmed, seemed to make better targets than anything else.  There are three other types of units that are technically classified as support groups, but no offense would be complete without them. Artillery is great for smashing enemy formations from afar. The same is true of Close Air Support (CAS) units. There's just not a lot that a bridge-layer can do against an A-10 Thunderbolt II. The Helicopters tend to get into the action a little more; which is a shame because they're so damned fragile. They do possess amazing speed and a wide range though so you'd be wise to protect them.  Controlling the platoons is pretty easy. It has to be. Things happen so quickly, that any delays or bottlenecks in the interface will get you killed. You'll find yourself getting real familiar with the hot keys-or you'll find yourself getting real dead...real soon. The whole thing can be controlled with the mouse, but there are some hot keys you've got to use to respond to threats in a timely manner. I was more than a little frustrated that your commanders don't show enough initiative, despite the fact that I always had the Rules of Engagement set to ~Fire at Will.~ I guess Will never showed up, because my guys usually didn't fire until the enemy was right on top of them. And attacks weren't really concentrated either. Since the game is all about combined arms and the electronic battlefield, I expected much more cooperation between platoons.  Unit movement was very good (apart from the previously mentioned tendency of other units to outrun my tanks). The pathfinding routines, while not perfect, strike a nice balance between unit cohesion and speed. Some units within the same platoon occasionally get separated, but everyone else in the platoon slows down until the stragglers catch up. You can also control the formation of individual platoons. This is a great feature because it really allows you to set up your attacks (and defenses) exactly the way you want them. I wish that units were better able to change formation on the fly. Every time I ordered a new formation, all the units slowed down, even if it wasn't necessary.  As important as the individual units are, losses in a previous scenario have no effect on the starting conditions for the next. Win without any units getting killed, or win with all but one unit getting killed--the next mission has the same starting conditions regardless. What you really need to preserve are your commanders. If an entire platoon is destroyed, the commander assigned to that platoon is KIA and unusable for the rest of the campaign. Hard to lead your men from the Great Beyond. And you definitely don't want to use the reserve commanders if you don't have to. Each commander has a specialty (armor, recon, etc.) and three skill ratings (combat, move and detection). Even though some of these commanders aren't the best, they're still preferable to the reservists. After all, all those guys do is get drunk and do push-ups every other weekend.  The graphics for the game are great. The weapon effects are truly spectacular. In particular, the TOW missiles are a sight to behold. Seeing that arc of smoke and waiting for the sound of billions of dollars of hardware suddenly becoming scrap iron is so satisfying. The individual vehicles are meticulously rendered. If I had to have a complaint, and you know me...I'm a complainer, it would be that the individual units are hard to tell apart even on opposing sides. Is that my tank? The damage textures are probably the best part of the game. And don't worry, you'll get plenty o' chances to see some damage...up close like. Add to the graphical feast trees and cottages, bunkers and even a space shuttle and you've got a graphic feast to rival even shrimp and steak night at the Golden Corral.  You view the game mainly from the Tactical 3D window. The camera is, sadly, always situated just above the lead vehicle in the selected platoon. A free roaming camera would have been better as it would have given you more opportunities to view the action. Still, the camera is very useful and really succeeds at drawing you into the action. The camera is very, very easy to use--just bump the edges of your screen with the mouse...well, the mouse cursor, not the actual mouse itself. The camera then spins around the lead unit of the platoon. Vertical movement isn't as good. The angle of the camera doesn't allow you to look straight down on your units or get down on the ground beside them. Oh well, c'est la guerre. There's also a Strategic view that's better for getting an overall impression of the terrain elevation, but it's no good for seeing the action. For the overall impression of the battle, I preferred to use the tiny strategic window in the corner of the screen.  So the game has a few AI flaws, mostly on the friendly side but it still plays very well. You really feel like you have a lot of control over your forces. And yet the options are still basic enough for you to get your teeth into the interface. The gameplay itself is smooth and free from bugs. Best of all, the game is big on versatility. The missions are varied enough to provide fresh challenges and the different types of units will force you to develop some innovative strategies--at least on the US side. Although US and Chinese campaigns play out very similar, you get a lot of room to experiment with tactics. Overall, it's a game I'm going to play after the review is over, and, as anyone at IGNPC will tell you, that says a lot.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Aug 19, 1999"}
