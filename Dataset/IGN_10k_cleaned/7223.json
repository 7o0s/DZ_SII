It's certainly an intriguing thought, with the intention being that you actually play a character rather than just the cards and machines. Unfortunately, there's very, very little character to be found here.   Walking through any of the casinos is rather clunky and slow. You can't run or speed up in any fashion, so your gambling addict simply walks from place to place. You'll find a handful of other casino-goers standing about at various games or talking to each other, but the layout of each casino is rather bland. In other words, though it's a neat idea to allow you to walk about a casino and find a game to play, it isn't interesting in the least in this case. It is possible to choose whichever game you'd like to play directly from the pause menu, but this sort of defeats the purpose. Plus, there aren't any cocktail girls, much to our dismay.   When it comes down to the casino games, each is about as utilitarian as possible. They work, yes, but in the most basic way possible and with little to no pizzazz. Video poker simply shows you five cards, slot machines have very basic ~blocks~, craps is a basic table and so on and so forth. None of them look particularly bad, per se, but they also aren't flashy in any way. In other words, they're akin to what you'll find in many free games online.    There's quite a bit of very basic presentation elements that are missing, however. While you can look at the rules for any of the games in the casino, which in and of themselves can be somewhat confusing to newcomers, you can't actually look at the odds or requirements for games. For instance, you can't tell what you need to hit on any given slot machine to win, or how much it'll pay out. Payouts for roulette are non-existent, video poker doesn't mention that you need to hit Jacks or better, and so on and so forth. It's kind of sad that something like a one-sheet payout table, information that's paramount to proper gambling, wasn't included.   Really, what it comes down to is that this is about as basic of a casino game that you can find. It works, and that's about it. The only incentive to winning anything is to either buy new clothes (which, really, who cares if no one else can see them?), or to open up a new casino. There isn't a big incentive for gambling carefully, either, as you can simply take out a ~loan~ when you're down on chips, but this just gives you $500 that never needs to be repaid. So why not simply grab the cash, throw it down on 35 and see where the roulette wheel stops.Payout Poker & Casino is about as simplistic as they come, and sadly lacks a few fundamental elements. You're much better off with practically any other gambling game on the market.", "date": "Sep 12, 2006"}
