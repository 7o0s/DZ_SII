Developed by the good folks at Crystal Dynamics, Pandemonium was a fun, quirky, and humorous platformer. While Pandemonium may not have been as widely known as the Tomb Raiders and Crash Bandicoots in its day, it has a chance at winning over a few N-Gage owners with its fun (if not very deep) platforming action.  Features  One to two players N-Gage Arena play Eleven stages (with mini-levels) Two playable characters 3D Environments, 2D gameplay  Gameplay  It is arguable whether Pandemonium is a true 3D game because the backgrounds and character models are three-dimensional, but the character's movements are restricted to a 2D path. In other words, players can only move their character left or right (not into the foreground or background), but the camera pans around the twists and turns of the levels to give the game the appearance of 3D. If Pandemonium focused on expansive exploration we would have been disappointed in this ~on-rails~ style of gameplay, instead we think it works very well with its platform-centric level designs.   Developers Ideaworks 3D have included two-player racing, and N-Gage Arena support in Pandemonium. Players will be able to access tips and strategies from the Arena, as well as compete against gamers from around the globe in the fun Shadow Racing mode. Shadow Racing is where people can race each other's recorded level times (like wireless two-player racing), and post their score for the rest of the world to see and admire. The online Shadow Racing mode is similar to Tomb Raider's, but is more fun because of Pandemonium's easier controls and quicker pace. Pandemonium serves as a glimpse at the slick possibilities of online enabled mobile games.  Pandemonium is all about jumping. The satisfaction of jumping on an enemy's head, the excitement of flying high through the air off a springy platform, and the suspense of keeping your balance as you jump from a wavering cliff. It may be a simple pleasure in the world of videogames, but a timeless and invigorating one. Although the jumping action is fun it certainly isn't without its flaws.   More times than we would like, we found ourselves at the ledge of a cliff without any indication that it would lead us to a bounty of treasure, or an untimely demise. Such short sightedness is common throughout Pandemonium, from enemies that spring onto the screen without any warning, to its numerous blind leaps of faith. Occasionally a string of treasures guides you to safe landing, but we can't help but feel a look/scroll feature or a broader perspective would have improved the game (but not without sacrificing the nice up-close visuals).   Players are given the option to choose from two different characters in Pandemonium, one is useful and the other is useless. Nikki, the acrobatic redhead has the indispensable ability to perform a double jump, and Fargus, a jester in red Converse All-Stars can attack enemies with a weird cartwheel move that is just plain unnecessary. Trust us, stick with Nikki; her high-flying jumps make the game less frustrating and loads more fun.  Graphics Pandemonium is set against some of the prettiest 3D backgrounds you will see on the N-Gage so far. There is a wide range of locations, from forests to deserts, to airships, to caverns, all are vividly colored and impressively rendered. Characters have fluid animations that feature them running, jumping, sliding, and even conveying boredom when the player leaves them idle. Framerate slows down in areas where there is bustling activity, but it doesn't become a nagging nuisance that interferes with gameplay. Pandemonium delivers near PlayStation quality graphics on par with Tony Hawk and Tomb Raider.  Sound While Pandemonium is never short on annoying sound effects, it has no soundtrack. Space limitations on the game card may have prevented developers Ideaworks 3D from including the original soundtrack to Pandemonium, but we would much rather have had a simple soundtrack as opposed to the numerous sound effects. Each jump is punctuated with a cheesy ~boing~, and enemies constantly drudge through stages with an initially funny but quickly annoying ~duh~ sound. We hope future N-Gage games opt for a larger game card instead of leaving the soundtrack out entirely. Pandemonium has its shining moments when it comes to fun, reflex driven jumping and fun N-Gage Arena play, but is harbored by its limited field of vision. It takes advantage of the N-Gage's graphical capabilities with its array of colorful levels, but left us unsatisfied in the audio department. Pandemonium would be a good choice for hardcore platforming fanatics looking for a little mindless but fun jumping action, but warrants a trial-rent for others.", "date": "Oct 7, 2003"}
