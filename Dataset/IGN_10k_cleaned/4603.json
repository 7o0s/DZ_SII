Lode Runner is one of the original platform games, featuring running and action gameplay, expertly fused with puzzle elements. There is a reason this franchise has survived the years, appearing in different forms on different platforms (PC, N64, GameCube) -- and now Hudson Entertainment is bringing it your handset.   Features:  Action/puzzler  Multiple puzzles   Lode Runner stars a cutie-poo miner trapped in a series of mazes. He is tasked with collecting as much treasure as possible, then finding a way out. Of course, these goals are made difficult by the presence of rival adventurers in the mazes. (The original game had the hero facing off against evil monks, but we can imagine ~evil monk~ doesn't play as well in this PC-era.)   This update features the same gameplay elements that made the original so popular. You have only one weapon, and it's hardly an offensive one. You use your shovel to dig pits in the ground. Now, you can fall through these pits to escape oncoming baddies, but more often than not, you'll use the pits to trap the rival miners. Pits fill themselves back eventually, so try to time your digs so they refill before a trapped miner can pull himself out.   While burying rival miners alive (which seems really morbid when you consider it), you must collect the treasure in each level. Only when you have collected all of the treasure does the exit ladder appear. Climb the ladder, only to find yourself in another maze where you must collect money and bury your foes. Which also describes a typical day at the office, come to think of it.   We tested Lode Runner on a T720, and the game played like a dream. Hudson's take on the classic is excellently realized. The updated visuals look fantastic -- bright, colorful, and decent-sized character sprites. Lode Runner control very well, too, which is a relief. We've played a couple classics that were completely torpedoed by poor control schemes.Lode Runner is an old friend that you hardly mind crashing on your couch, or your cellphone's memory bank. The game has been expertly updated with new graphics (I still love the old, Spartan look, though) and new puzzles. Hudson is yet another console publisher/developer bringing its wares to the handset realm, and fortunately, they've brought their console sensibilities with them. Considering how well this, Bomberman and Burgertime worked out, I cant wait to see what else Hudson brings to the decks in the future.", "date": "Mar 31, 2004"}
