{"name": "Rayman 2", "name_review": "Rayman 2: The Great Escape", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/09/14/rayman-2-the-great-escape", "text": "When platform characters are brought up in conversation, the likes of Nintendo's Mario, Sega's Sonic and Naughty Dog's Crash Bandicoot are typically the ones who get the most mention. However, one of my personal favorites has been Ubi Soft's Rayman. Mario is just some fat Italian plumber, Sonic's some loud-mouthed hedgehog and Crash is just some annoying little bandicoot. They're all cool characters, but none of them have the same creative design that Rayman does. He has no limbs or joints and he looks kind of silly, but it just works. Rayman is one of the coolest platform characters ever conceived and his first title, a 2D game released on multiple systems including the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, was one of the best platform games of its time.   Well, the lovable guy is back in his first 3D adventure on PlayStation. And unlike most platformers that make the jump from 2D to the third dimension, there hasn't been a lot lost in the move in Rayman 2. In fact, in many ways, Rayman's jump to 3D has produced a game that is superior to its 2D brethren.   Gameplay Platform games have been around for a long time, but very few that have ventured into the 3D realm have really managed to reach a level of excellence in control and level design set by their 2D counterparts. Rayman 2 is one of the few titles that has managed to do this. Apart from a few instances where you'll experience slight camera problems, which can be easily fixed with the simple press of a button, the control that the player has over Rayman just feels perfect.   The general control is very tight and there'll never be a moment in the game where you're hit by enemy fire or miss a jump that you'll be able to chalk up to being the game's fault and not your own. In what's exclusive to the PlayStation version of the game, players are able to use both analog sticks on the Dual Shock controller that nets them a feeling of control and fluidity that's rare in a game of this kind. Using the left analog stick, players are given complete, 360 degree control over the character. And, with the right analog stick, players can control Rayman's other movements, such as jumping and shooting. The jumping is accomplished by pressing down the analog stick (which is the R3 button) and pressing the stick to the left or right, simulating the throwing motion of Rayman's arms, will make him shoot. For those not hip to the dual analog thing, you can accomplish the same things with the Square and X buttons.   Unlike many of today's platform games that like to extend the replay value by requiring the player traverse the same levels over and over to collect all of the bananas or stars, Rayman 2 relies more on creative level designs with a more linear approach to getting through the levels. The levels are well designed and will require the player to use some true platforming skills in order to get through them. And while there are Lums that need to be collected, the game never breaks down into some lame hunt for items, as the goal of the game is more about the story and making it through the levels -- which it really should be all about.   In order to bring the story more to the forefront and give the player more incentive and rewards for playing the game, the developers have upped the importance of the game's secondary characters and villains. Not only do these minor characters brought to life with voices, but they play a larger role in the game because they're the ones that Rayman has got to free instead of just the Lums, which he had to set free in the N64 and Dreamcast versions of the game. This really helps give the player an extra sense of accomplishment and adds to the general enjoyment of the game.   The bottom line is that this is one of the best 3D platform games that you'll find on PlayStation. You'll be hard pressed to find another on the system that controls this well, offers the same amount of challenge and is as enjoyable to play.   Graphics It doesn't come close to the Dreamcast version of the game in the realm of graphics, but neither does the processing power of Sony's 32-bit PlayStation when compared to Sega's 128-bit Dreamcast. Taking into account the system it's on and the limitations of the system, there's no denying that Rayman 2 is a visual masterpiece and stands as a testament to the fact that the development staff at Ubi Soft's Shanghai office was able to get more out of the PlayStation than some other developers have been able to accomplish after several years of working on the venerable platform.   The game is filled with some of the best looking 3D environments that you'll find on PlayStation and this is made possible because the developers seemed to have paid special attention to the game's textures. The general texture quality that you'll see on the characters and background elements are quite astonishing, with the end result being some of the most lush and vibrant gameplay environments imaginable.   By using vertex colors, the developers were able to create these beautiful backgrounds and characters that give off the impression that the game is running in PlayStation's high-resolution mode, while it's not really. It's just that the vertex colors make it possible to give the 3D objects a greater sense of volume, sharpness, and general detail.   Players will also find that Rayman 2 moves at silky smooth 30 frames per second with some very detailed character animation. There aren't any noticeable transition segments in the characters' animation, as it flows smoothly from one movement to the next, and there's never any noticeable slowdown or major glitches to speak of. The best thing that can be said about the graphics in Rayman 2 is that it actually rivals the general colorfulness, detail, and artistic design of its 2D brethren. The same can't be said about most games that have made the jump from 2D to 3D.   Sound If you're looking for a weak link in this game, you won't find it in the game's audio. The soundtrack is remarkable in quality, orchestration and composition and the background noises and sound effects, such as the four different plumping sounds that you get when Rayman runs or walks over different surface types, are all extremely well done.   In what's currently exclusive to the PlayStation version of the game, Rayman 2 includes recorded voices for just about all of the main characters in the game, including Rayman himself. While some fans of the limbless hero might feel remiss for the days of old where Rayman didn't speak in a language understandable by our kind, the general voice acting job for him and the game's other figures have been done fairly well.   Plus, if you would rather the characters speak in a tongue that you can't comprehend, there's always the option to play the game in French or Spanish, complete with voice acting in either of those two languages. It's actually quite entertaining to hear good old Rayman showoff his Spanish language skills and his French voice is very charming.  The only problem with this game is that it was released long after versions hit store shelves for both the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Dreamcast. Simply put, if it weren't for the fact that the Dreamcast version of the game wasn't already pushing the limits of Sega's 128-bit system in terms of visual excellence and game design, Rayman 2 for PlayStation would probably stand out a lot more than it currently does. The simple truth is that some of the magic of the game is lost when you play it on PlayStation after seeing how beautiful the world looks on Dreamcast. However, that's not really a legitimate reason to knock the game and compared to its peers on PlayStation, Rayman 2 can hold its own against any other platform game on the system. The game has very few flaws, it's one of the best designed platform games of all time, and if you don't have a Dreamcast and you consider yourself a fan of 3D platform adventure games, there's no reason why you shouldn't go out and buy this game right now. It's right up there with Ape Escape as the system's best platform game and it's a better overall gaming experience than any of the Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon games.", "date": "Sep 14, 2000"}
