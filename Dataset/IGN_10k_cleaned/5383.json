Santa Monica-based mobile developer Gosub 60 (clever name) sure does and has released a downloadable love letter to the aging genre with their new shooter, OP15: Rising Threat. An arcade game to the core, OP15: Rising Threat will provide a startling challenge to most wireless game players -- and in what feels like a real blessing, that challenge comes not from horrid controls, but legit game difficulty.   The plot is standard fare: You are a one-an army sent to infiltrate an island base and diffuse the threat of a madman. Gosub 60 knew what they were doing when they named the madman Commander Kahn, because by what feels like your twentieth death at the hands of his minions, you be yelling ~Kahhhhn!~ with Kirk-like ferocity.   Your supersoldier, MC, has plenty of firepower to use against Kahn's forces. MC's standard-issue rifle can be upgraded temporarily with machine guns, spread shots, grenades, and tanks. We just wish these power-ups showed up a little more frequently, as they bad guys in OP15: Rising Threat are no push-over. They have dead-eye aim and take often take a few shots before dropping.   Your rifle does have an auto-aim feature of sorts, but when more than one enemy trooper shows up, it's a mean feat of thumb dexterity to seek cover and pop out quick enough to squeeze off a few rounds before hiding behind the game's plentiful barriers and obstacles. Unless you are behind a barrier, standing still is a death wish in OP15: Rising Threat. It would help greatly if MC employed faster footwork, too.   Your grenades help even the score a little bit, but before long, you'll be amazed by the sheer level of difficulty. Levels are giant, spilling upwards for what seems like miles. There are rare stretches when the terrain is empty of Kahn's soldiers, but for the most part, these sharpshooters are everywhere. You can cover ground a little faster with a tank, which also doubles as a thirty-ton cruise missile capable of running over enemies. Unfortunately, the tank is a little short on armor, as Kahn's soldiers are capable of destroying it mere minutes after you climb behind the controls.   The levels in OP15: Rising Threat offer varied terrain that serves a greater purpose than eye candy. For example, rivers can be used as cover. If you're careful and quiet, you can slip by several of Kahn's troops while chest-deep in the drink. The game includes several sound effects, such as shooting noises, but there's nothing terribly exemplary here.  OP15: Rising Threat is a hard game. Personally, I like a good challenge when it's legit -- and OP15: Rising Threat's difficulty is built into the game itself. The enemies are plentiful and the levels are long -- both good things to have in a shooter. However, there are times when it feels that the deck is stacked against you. I often wished I had greater access to upgraded weapons since the enemy troops are such good shots. I also wanted MC just to move a little bit faster. Not necessarily fast enough to out-run a bullet, but at least to give me a fighting chance to find cover when Kahn's dudes converged on my position.Regardless of these small complaints, I was still impressed with OP15: Rising Threat. It's not for everybody, but fans of the genre will likely enjoy the throwback charms and the mounting difficulty.", "date": "Dec 9, 2004"}
