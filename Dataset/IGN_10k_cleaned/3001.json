Made up primarily of younger children and the wives/girlfriends of super-dedicated videogame jockeys, the addicting puzzler has a unique ability: to bring couples and families who aren't normally into this digital hobby of ours together for a peaceful game of ~shoot and drop~.   The latest in this long tradition is Super Bust-A-Move 2, and though it isn't a huge leap over the previous installment (they still haven't included a four-player mode), there's enough meat in the gameplay (and a stellar alternate approach called Chain Reaction) to warrant a purchase by devoted fans and curious first-timers alike.   Gameplay  Before I begin my analysis, let me ask this one question: what is there to be said about Bust-A-Move that hasn't been said before? I mean honestly, it's so similar in all its incarnations and forms that even players who haven't touched the series since in years will be able to pick up and play it again as though they never left. It's one of the game's real strong points actually, and to be honest, why change something that was great to begin with?   In the remote possibility that someone out there hasn't actually played the game before, it's really quite simple. You begin each puzzle with a certain amount of colored marbles at the top of your screen, and clear them by matching up those marbles in three-color succession. Three greens will break the chain, three reds, three yellows, and so on and so on. Occasionally however, you'll find special marbles that change the landscape of the puzzle quite drastically. Like the flashing orbs that randomly transform the marble it touches to another color, a rainbow that can only be eliminated by chaining a color above them, or the fire marbles that automatically destroy anything it touches.   In the latter levels the game actually turns out to be very strategic and is definitely an obsessively addicting time killer. Despite its disgustingly cutesy approach and sickening presentation, I can't tell you how many times I tried to put the controller down to do something else and still found myself playing anyway. There should be a law against games like this, but until the world becomes a George Orwell type living space, this sadly will not happen.   To the developer's credit, the team has really tried to add a lot of options to package this time around and expand upon what we had in the first PlayStation 2 version. There's a story mode (yes, believe it), an option for battle mode called ~Chain Reaction~, and even a Puzzle Editor where you can build your own challenges.   At its best, the Story Mode is nothing more than a regular one-player game with cut scenes added between each session. And though it does add a little bit of flavor to the game's quirky (and sometimes disturbing) personalities, it's not enough to further the series anywhere near the Northern vicinity. Puzzle edit is fun too, and aspiring game designers may want to check it out to see just how well they can challenge themselves, but the real meat of the game for me was the Chain Reaction feature.   Played against a computer or human opponent, Chain Reaction shoots the bottom marble of whatever line you just broke to the next matching marble elsewhere on the screen. For every line you break, that's another marble that seeks out a like-minded friend and before you know it the screen is littered with different colors, combinations, and fireworks. It's the the type of mode that warms your gullet and it works very well. In fact, I don't think you can go back to the regular Bust-A-Move method of play again once you've experienced this mode.   Graphics  I remember when Bust-A-Move was on the Super Nintendo, and apparently so does Taito as it appears that Super 2 was ported over from one. Though the animations are much heavier and the coSuper Bust-A-Move 2 is pretty much what it's always been: Bust-A-Move. I DO dig the Chain Reaction mode though, and the Puzzle Edit feature was well worth the time that I spent with it. But in all honesty, this is a game that I played the majority of when the PS2 was first released in October of 2000. Good but not great, Super Bust-A-Move 2 is recommended only for obsessive puzzle fans, effeminate men in permanent tuxedos, and anime girls who actually spell the word ~giggle~ when speaking.", "date": "Oct 2, 2002"}
