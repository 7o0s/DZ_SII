Square Enix's Final Fantasy XI and its first add-on pack Rise of the Zilart, after all, were already huge; and throwing in 40 additional areas spanning four all-new regions only serves to make it even bigger. But bigger is exactly what Final Fantasy XI: Chains of Promathia truly is, as it adds a considerable amount real estate compared to most enhancement bundles out there -- with storyline superfluities that are rarely seen in appendices of this type.   In fact, its the storyline of Chains of Promathia that stands out as its most significant addition. As despite the countless new areas that players are able to explore, it's the plotline that Square Enix wants to stress most. Estimated to offer up to three times as much content of the original game and the first expansion combined, Promathia bolsters its lineup of quests, missions, and important story points far beyond its inspiration and should more than satisfy Vana'diel veterans. For players that have spent the better part of the last five months building and creating their own unique Final Fantasy super beings, this additional content is probably what they've been waiting for.   In case you missed it, Chains of Promathia weaves the tale of the twilight deity named (what else?) Promathia. Imprisoned by his own self-imposed chains, the mysterious new omnipotent antagonist is apparently connected to a bizarre phenomenon that has begun to engulf Vana'diel known as ~The Emptiness.~  Prophesizing that the Armageddon is near, the great summon Bahamut suddenly materializes in order to warn the people of the world and is later followed by the appearance of several other mysterious beings throughout the adventure. The nameless enigmatic youth, Ulmia the Tavnazian, Tenzen the Samurai, a mysterious secret society known as the Armathrwn, and a handful of others are just a few of the new forces at work here; and all are somehow connected to the storyline in relation to the past, present, and future of Vana'diel -- To say that the plot is a lot more interesting than before would be an understatement.   Click For More Images Of course, getting to that content is what may turn out to be quite an issue for PlayStation 2 players -- including one of my colleagues over at IGN Cars who's an avid Final Fantasy XI player himself. Because unfortunately for console users, it seems that canceling the installation of Chains of Promathia (accidentally or otherwise) at any time completely erases your original FFXI and Rise of the Zilart installs too; prompting you to have to start over from scratch and reinstall everything from the original disc over again.   Luckily for Windows PC users, this isn't an issue -- as it seems that canceling the Promathia install does exactly what it's supposed to (though, we haven't tested it enough times to guarantee this 100%, so users of either version should still be careful). It's an annoying hitch to say the least, and one that trigger-happy installers may want to take note of as they wait the 25 minutes it tales for the new pack to decompress onto their hard drives.   But in keeping with a common practice nowadays, my hope for out of the box readiness isn't exactly part of publisher's gameplan. The reason for this is that users can expect an additional hour or so wait so to upgrade their files after installation before being completely up to date and ready for business. Longtime experts of MMORPGs probably wont mind the lengthy process one bit, but for console owners who aren't yet used to the ways of the massively multiplayer, the wait could definitely be viewed as a setback. Once you're finally installed, though, the changes to the game are pretty obvious, and if you're of a high enough level (level 30 and up), you can immediately gain access to the new stuff.   That new stuff, as it is, is pretty cleverly designed too. Because although many of the several new areas are readily available from the start, others are completely hidden until a specific quest or storyline parameter has been accomplished. To mix things up, other areas and environments will actually temporarily lower your level and cap you so that you're forced to defeat it using a particular set of skills and equipment (re: The Emptiness environments).    There's a nice selection of new enemies in Chains of Promathia too, and for the most part, they're as difficult as all hell. The monsters from the aforementioned Emptiness levels in particular will absolutely love to kick your ass on a regular basis, and the selection of other new beasties like the hideous-looking Corse and the creepy crab-like Diremite are so annoying that they're bothersome in that unexplainable good way. One of my favorite new monsters, though, are the Antlions that were first made famous in Final Fantasy IV during Edward's (or Gilbert's for you purists out there) quest for the Sand Ruby. Available in two types, the Antlions can either come after you head-on with their scary and powerful jaws or they'll burrow beneath the sand and hide to surprise and trap you as you go along. Cool stuff.   Environmentally, Chains offers a much better selection of areas to explore in terms of visuals and music than what we saw before. More heavily populated with foliage, underbrush, and various other bits of nature, the vastly diverse selection of territory is truly eye-catching. On a PC with all the bells and whistles turned all the way up, is easily among the best looking environments found in all the high-end MMORPGs, while the PS2 version absolutely crushes its only competitor around in Sony's EverQuest Online Adventures.   The expansion's only real roadblock, however, (other than the possible console installation problems I mentioned earlier), is the fact that users looking for new elements of gameplay aren't going to find very much. So while there are a couple of new mini-games like clam digging to toy around with, as well as an interesting new way to travel by boat (which, by the way, is both cool and beautiful to look at), neither of them are supplemented by more immediately earth shattering additions like new character classes or things of that nature. And when you have a collection of new environments and quests this huge, leaving out an equally big new character upgrade feels like somewhat of a loss. But maybe that's just me?Regardless of any major gameplay overhauls, Final Fantasy XI: Chains of Promathia is still a great addition to the existing FFXI universe. Though PC users have the superior version, they may not get as much out of the experience as console users will thanks to Windows' vastly superior selection of MMORPG options (hence the lower score for that platform), there's still enough solid storyline and environmental content here to keep you busy for months on end. In fact, chances are that most players are still slashing their way through the original version of FFXI and Rise of the Zilart even now -- which is a testament to how big the world really is prior to even having to worry about adding Promathia to it.No matter how far along players may be with the original adventure, however, Chains of Promathia should definitely reward Final Fantasy fans who were disappointed in the first game's anemic sense of storyline with what they've been looking for. In contrast, the more gameplay-oriented users out there may find themselves a bit disappointed in the new feature set. Either way, Vana'diel diehards and fanatics should definitely check it out.", "date": "Sep 28, 2004"}
