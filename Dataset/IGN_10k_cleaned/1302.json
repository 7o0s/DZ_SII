I notice that didn't exactly raise your eyebrows.  That kind of reaction is understandable, since it's hardly a crown one has to strive very mightily for - who do you have to beat, Cool Boarders and Trick'n Snowboarder?  Not exactly the stiffest of competition.  THQ and Radical Entertainment deserve their due, though, because not only is Pure Ride the best game of its sort around, it honestly is fun to play in its own right, not just in comparison to the rest of the rot that crowds its genre.  It makes its way beyond the linear, racing-based model of most other snowboarding games - at its best, it creates something like the free-flowing environments of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, letting you wander around and challenge yourself to see what tricks you're capable of.  There are enough game modes, and enough corresponding different ways to play the game, that you're not locked into a particular game model that isn't much fun to begin with.  Graphics  Of course, you may have a bit of a sinking feeling in your gut when you first hit the slopes in Pure Ride.  For some reason, the brief course flyover sequences, before the camera sweeps around to lock behind your rider, run at a single-digit framerate.  After that, though, things settle down to a reasonable pace, as your riders zip down the slopes in perfectly playable fashion.  The camera behaves itself most of the time as well, although it does futz you up a little if you come to a dead stop around a sharp slope, or on odd occasions on the halfpipe courses.  The overall level of detail, for both the characters and backgrounds, is lower than some of the competition, but it makes sense given how big of an environment Pure Ride is rendering in comparison to the narrower tracks of something like Cool Boarders.  The game makes up for that, meanwhile, with fluidity and speed in its progression and animation.  You can occasionally see some joint breakup in some of the characters' trick animations, but the movements themselves are smooth and realistic.  The way characters accelerate into a spin is a cool touch, and the bail animations (accompanied by goofy bits of jargon like ~gnarly!~ or ~hucker!~) are suitably impressive, while at the same time not taking up too much of your time.  The game's collision detection is sometimes a bit off, although not usually in a way that hampers gameplay.  It's just a little strange to see your boarder yanked a foot or so onto a rail, or crash straight through a seemingly solid box - the developers seem to have decided to err on the side of friendliness when it comes to clipping and railslide detection.  It's better than the alternative, I suppose, which would see you endlessly missing rails by inches.  Gameplay  Pure Ride has a fair number of game modes and level types available, but outside the necessities of working through the championships and unlocking all the goodies, Slopestyle mode is where it's at.  Stuff like the halfpipe and big air modes are included as concessions to the real-life format of the sport and the traditions of the game genre, but there's not a lot of fun to be had going back and forth down a pipe, let alone just charging straight at a single quarter.  The trick suite isn't broad enough to keep the halfpipe from getting repetitive, and the point of big air frankly escapes me. The load times become pretty aggravating there as well, too, since the game chooses to load between every run, even between two ten-second charges at the big air wall.  So dither around with that big stupid wall only as long as you have to, then hit the slopestyle courses, where you're let loose on a giant run full of lines and obstacles to trick off of.  This is where Pure Ride shines, because it gives you plenty of room to pull big tricks, and plenty of different ways in which to perform them.  From side to side and top to bottom, its slopes have far more space than most boarding games, and every one is packed with ramps, rails, trees, hills, trucks, and lift lines (yes, you can ride the lift lines).  The layouts are intelligently designed, with combinations built in.  You can air off a hill, land on a fallen tree, and hop from there over a cliff to the lift lines - providing you have enough speed and skill, naturally.  In other words, getting there is most of the fun.  The emphasis on big tricks and combinations in the slopestyle mode makes for a lot more fun than some other games' trainwrecks between racing and tricks.  It's no fun when a game demands that you do both at the same time (a la Cool Boarders DC), because tricks always get in the way of speed, and trying to go fast always gets in the way of tricks.  Of course, EA's SSX found another way around the problem, but it's a very different kind of game from Pure Ride.  Pure Ride does resemble SSX as far as certain aspects of its trick control, though - like EA's game, the D-pad is used for flips and spins, while grab tricks are assigned to the face buttons.  Shoulder buttons act as accelerators for your rotation, letting you pull of 1080s and 1260s and occasionally even more ridiculous stunts.  I could have done with a few more grab tricks, since in practice it doesn't seem like you're likely to do more than three with a given character, but I do like the way the D-pad system works.  It's a little more realistically challenging than just hitting a button to do a backflip or misty.  The inclusion of character-specific hidden tricks is a nice bonus, too.  Yes, they're just a touch on the fantastic side, but they're very well-animated, and a fun Easter egg to uncover.  A much more significant extra is Pure Ride's create-a-mountain mode, which makes up for the two-dimensional level preview with a decent amount of space and objects to work with.  You can build proper, varied runs, as well as the usual goofball creations like a dozen tractor-trailers placed end to end.  It lets you make your own challenges, although the game also provides plenty of pre-made challenges in its stunt mode, leading you through a series of progressively more difficult tests of your ability to link tricks and rails together.  Sound  There are perhaps two names I recognize on the Pure Ride soundtrack, but it's a surprisingly cool collection of music, a Tony Hawk 2 sort of melange combining some punk, some slower rock, and a little bit of hip-hop (even one reggae-tinged track).  Bender and Gray Area, whoever they happen to be, contribute two of my favorite tracks, more than making up for the one or two dogs coming from acts like Incubus (there, that one should get the kids riled up).  The effects suite, meanwhile, is suitably inoffensive.  The whoosh of board through snow goes well with the soundtrack, and when it's punctuated by the thud of a crash or the scratchy sound of sliding down a rail, the incidental sounds don't make too much of a dent in the atmosphere.  Some input from the crowd might have been fun, a la the competition levels in Tony Hawk 2, but they only make their opinions known at the end of a run, where you'll get a loud ovation or some disappointed sighs.  Speaking of which, why do they cheer me when I get fourth place?  Are they trying to rub it in, in some ironic way?  Presentation  Pure Ride's interface giveth, and it also taketh away in some ways, although it may not bother some people.  I like the visual design of the menu system, and I very much like the track selector function that appears during the load screens.  However, I don't like how often I get to fiddle with that track selector.  The game loads often, and it loads long - between most every run, even if they're on the same course with the same boarder.  I also dislike the board selection screens, which choose to outline each board's capabilities only in dense technical jargon.  Authenticity is all well and good, and that's aided by the fact that every board is a licensed facsimile of a real-life counterpart, but it would be nice if there was some clearer information for the grommets in the audience, just a simple descriptor like ~Freestyle~ or ~Alpine,~ or maybe a handy little bar graph.  I haven't got a copy of the manual, though - for all I know, it contains a glossary specifically designed to address this, with definitions of things like ~sidecut.~ Okay, enough of me quibbling, back to the bigger picture.  Pure Ride isn't a perfect game, but its quality shines past its flaws enough that I recommend it to anyone looking for a good snowboarding game this fall.  It builds on Radical's already respectable work in the last MTV Sports snowboarding game, and it handily stomps all over the latest weak Cool Boarders rehash.  Though Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is a much better game in a general sense, Pure Ride compares to the competition in much the same way Tony Hawk did at its debut - it offers a well-rounded experience based on a variety of challenges, rather than what amounts to just another racing game.Perfection still eludes this genre on the PlayStation, but I look forward to what Radical does in the future, especially on a next-generation console.  With a little bit more technical muscle at their fingertips, I expect they'll be able to do something pretty impressive with their next snowboarding game.", "date": "Oct 3, 2000"}
