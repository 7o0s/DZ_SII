We've seen it all before with games like Fantastic Four (PlayStation) and Mission: Impossible. Game developers, overjoyed by the licenses they've snagged, forget about everything else and the end product suffers greatly. A Bug's Life, based on the computer-animated Disney/Pixar film of the same name, doesn't quite fit into the above category of shoddy movie-to-game ports, but it certainly doesn't introduce anything new or exciting to the 3D platformer genre either.   The Facts  Based on Pixar's movie.  15 levels.  Three hidden stages.  60 all-new challenges.  Voice samples from many of the original actors from the movie.  Rumble Pak support.    Gameplay The game, very much like the movie, follows the adventures of a likeable ant named Flik as he sets out to defend his threatened ant hill from a band of savage grasshoppers. In the film, the magic of Disney is in full effect, conveying a life-like sub-world that is every bit as real and gigantic as our own. Unfortunately, this sensation does not carry over into the polygonal 3D worlds of the videogame. Rather, everything follows a set-path and is, by comparison to other 3D platformers, very confined.   Players travel through 15+ levels in a fashion similar to Mario 64 or Banjo-Kazooie, minus the tight gameplay mechanics of both. Flik is manipulated using the analog stick while the D-pad works to raise or lower the camera view. The A button jumps and the B button throws berries. Both buttons also serve additional purposes. For example, pressing the A button twice immediately results in a Mario-esque butt-stomp. In some rare cases, developer Traveller's Tales has even implemented a unique addition of its own such as the ability to butt-slide, which is done by pressing the A button twice and holding. As you can tell, though, for the most part, the game plays very much like Mario or Banjo before it except that A Bug's Life doesn't feel nearly as fine-tuned or optimized. What we mean by this is that the game controls a bit sluggishly and even the simple task of nailing an enemy with a berry feels clumsy and confused. The end result is a sub-par gaming experience that weighs in a full second to benchmarks set by previous Nintendo 64 platformers.  Levels are laid out in a variety of different ways, but the challenges in each are closely paralleled. Often the challenge is simply to make it to the end of the level, which can be executed by running straight-forward and avoiding enemies. Early on, we were a bit surprised by just how easy some of the stages were. In almost all of the levels, Flik must collect and plant seeds in various locations in order to gain access to new areas. For example, some ledges are too high for the ant to reach, but by planting a springy mushroom seed near the area, players can trampoline themselves to the upper level. Basic platformer stuff here, but it's satisfying nonetheless.  At the end of the day, the gameplay mechanics are not horrible. The game itself does not play particular bad. Likewise, the levels are not especially poor. But none of the above is exceptional either. It all amounts for a very average gaming experience. And while this, mixed with an admittedly popular movie license, might be enough for younger gamers, hard-core platformer fans are likely to be disappointed if not offended.  Graphics Visually, A Bug's Life for Nintendo 64 practically screams, ~Hey, I'm a port! Look at me, boys and girls, I'm just a quick, easy port and I'm here to make a quick, easy buck!~ We dusted off the PlayStation copy of A Bug's Life and booted it up for a side-by-side comparison to the Nintendo 64 incarnation, both of which are developed by the same game-maker, by the way. Right off the bat we noticed additional FMV cut-scenes for the PlayStation version, but we shrugged it off. After all, it's a well-known fact that Nintendo 64 games can't do FMV -- unless, of course, we're talking about Angel Studios' exceptional port of Resident Evil 2 to the console, which features all the cut-scene goodness of the PlayStation original. Cinema-scenes aside, the PlayStation version of A Bug's Life features a cleaner, more colorful look than that seen in the Nintendo 64 game. What's more, it boasts a far superior framerate. The Nintendo 64 port of the title looks a bit more grainy, a bit more foggy, a bit more blurry and runs a bit slower. It's got a bit of everything bad, really. Sadly, we're not here to report that the PlayStation version of A Bug's Life is a visual treat with without flaws. But it's far better looking than the sloppy port which has been handed to Nintendo 64 owners.  Sound The music in the game is bright, cheery and very A Bug's Life-esque. Upbeat tunes and happy flute-like chords do a nice job of adding atmoshphere. Flik is armed with an equally silly arsenal of berry splats and friendly calls from fellow bugs, as well as remarks from enemies. Everything sounds as one might expect it would, though it would have been nice if Traveller's Tales had utilized Factor 5's MORT sound compression technology for higher quality, licensed music from the film. A Bug's Life for Nintendo 64 is a totally average 3D platformer aimed at Nintendo 64's younger audience. This audience isn't likely to mind that it's basically a quick, in some cases sloppy port of the PlayStation original, which debuted for the 32-bit console last year. Nor will it mind that A Bug's Life has been done plenty of times before for Nintendo 64 -- and better -- in games like Banjo-Kazooie and Super Mario 64. And that's not such a bad thing because A Bug's Life isn't an especially bad game. But for those of us who have played through and loved the likes of Banjo-Kazooie and Super Mario 64, well, A Bug's Life just doesn't live up. It plays slower, it's less intuitive, it's less inventive and it looks exactly like a quick and easy port of the PlayStation original.In the end, the license is the strongest part of A Bug's Life for Nintendo 64 -- and that's never a good thing.", "date": "Jun 2, 1999"}
