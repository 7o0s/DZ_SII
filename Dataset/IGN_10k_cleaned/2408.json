Soon, we'll be taking on AI enemies smarter than us, getting into incredibly intricate gameplay mechanics, and experiencing some of the most intense visual splendor ever to be seen in a video game.  But with all the complexity we'll soon be experiencing with the next level of gaming, it's good to know there are still some developers who believe in the simple pleasures of blowing stuff up real good... and making it look pretty darn awesome in the process.  The latest craze in making video game visuals look awesome is the craft of water effects.  As demonstrated at last year's E3, numerous companies displayed games with some of the most incredible looking water effects and for the Xbox, one that has gotten our attention is Stormfront's Blood Wake.  There was no doubt that the impressive speed, explosive combat, and incredible water physics of this game impressed any that got their hands on this water vehicular combat game and thankfully, the gameplay wasn't too shabby.  It might be a bit simplistic and a bit short-lived, but Blood Wake features some great shooting action and solid multiplayer features; Xbox owners should have those sea-sickness pills handy.  While the story doesn't play a huge role in this game, it certainly paints an interesting setting.  Set in a fictional island world, you play former Lieutenant Shao Kai of the Northern League, who talks like a slightly bad imitation to Jack Burton.  In any case, while on a routine patrol, his squadron is beset by a surprise attack by Shao Lung - yup, his brother.  Left floating dead in the water, Shao Kai is rescued by the Shadow Clan and for saving his life, he enters into the service of the Shadow Clan as a sea raider.  But Shao Kai isn't interested about pillaging rival clans - he wants revenge even if he has to blow up every ship in the Dragon Sea.  And believe me, after you finish this game, you'll feel like if you've just done that. Gameplay  To say the action in Blood Wake is explosive may be a bit of an understatement.  As you race across the sea on various missions for the Shadow Clan, most of your missions will differ in goals, but you'll always get the chance to blow opposing ships into itty-bitty pieces of junk.  This is done with the various watercraft armed to the bow with torpedoes, water mines, gun cannons, and rockets.  Obviously, each ship will have its own strengths and weaknesses and the differences between each boat are quite big; smaller ships will obviously have better speed and maneuverability, but due to their size, lack the number of weapons and the durability of larger ships.   There are over ten battleships and depending on what type of missions you'll be undertaking, it's pretty important to select the suitable ship with the right weapons.  Missions range from your typical ~destroy these targets, search and collect treasure, and/or escort and protect a convoy~ fare but they are far from boring thanks to the aggressive AI in this game.  CPU opposing forces are pretty darn vicious and smart; enemies will often send one boat to run in as a decoy to draw you attention and if you take the bait, the rest of the ships will speed behind your back for the easy kill.  Thus you have to be pretty careful about each mission especially situations where you'll attack bases of opposing forces; during these missions, the enemy will have mounted cannons on land that will severely cripple your ship should you choose to ignore them.  Beyond using the correct weapon for the right situations as well as picking the right ship for each mission, the biggest gameplay factor that will determine your success is your ability to navigate the dangerous seas.  The exciting water physics are just for looks as they play a major role in how you control your ship.  As you battle against enemy watercraft, you'll obviously cause some big ripples and waves in the ocean.  You can often use these huge waves to perform daring airborne stunts and quick evasive techniques especially when engaging a host of nasties.  Better yet, you can setup some dangerous and damaging attacks if you can carefully send boats in the air.  For example, if an enemy gets hit by one of your torpedoes, they'll be sent into the air for a brief moment and if your lucky enough, launching a salvo of rockets toward the airborne opponent will massively damage the enemy boat and will likely have that ship land upside down unable to attack.  And if you're really gutsy, there's nothing more exciting than using your turbo to send your ship over a wave, ~jumping~ opposing boats, and dropping a depth charge while in mid-air.  Violent but beautiful art in motion, if I do say so myself.  However, it's pretty rare that you'll actually get to pull off impressive tricks like the one described and for the most part, it's better to play it safe than daring.  There are power-ups from time to time, but none that give players additional weapons; just the standard power-ups of strength, speed, and shield.  It's kind of disappointing that you can't pick-up new weapons during missions and furthermore, you can't customize the boats.  Each boat is stuck with its own unique weapons and you can't change the weapon configuration at all.  In other words, if you want to use a specific weapon, you'll have to play a particular ship and that might not be the ship you'll want to control. Graphics Blood Wake may not contain the incredible detail and visual splendor of Halo, but the game isn't bad looking by a long shot.  Running at a smooth 30 fps, there's rarely any slowdown at all.  Considering the incredible amount of water animation, firing weapons, big explosions, and tons of debris flying, that's pretty amazing; of course, we wonder why the game couldn't be blazing along at a higher frame rate.  Nonetheless, the attention to detail is pretty remarkable and it's worthy to note the wonderful animations of the weapons on your ship.  When you select certain weapons to use, you'll see mechanic devices load torpedoes into tubes, deck doors open to reveal rocket launchers, gun turrets turn slightly to get a better angle of fire, etc.  Levels are what you expect from a game based on water world; expanse and full of motion.  There isn't a huge amount of detail to backgrounds but there's definitely some nice architecture to enemy bases, especially in the later stages when you fight the Jade kingdom.  What's pretty cool are the different weather conditions and times during missions; stormy waters will have rain falling and some very choppy seas, while night missions shine a lovely moon reflection on the water.  Intermission stories are told through the use of detailed pencil sketches that some may argue is a complete rip-off of the graphic novel style panels used in Max Payne to tell the story.  Even if that's the case, it's certainly not a bad thing and I actually like several of the detailed pencil sketches as simplistic as that might seem. Sound Set in a fictional Asian pacific island empire, there's definitely an Asian influence on the design of the ships and certainly with the overall look of the game.  This translates to the sound and music as well, a mixed bag as you've got some pretty bad Chinese accents on some of the characters combined with decent music that's almost as catchy as the intro credits music that plays in ~Enter The Dragon~.  The sound effects in Blood Wake are very well done whether it's the thunderous ~American V8~ sound of your boat motor running at full throttle, the explosions of boats before they capsize into the water depths, or even the sound of torpedoes fired into the water. It's an interesting orchestra of good sound effects only interrupted once in awhile by the annoying comments of your badly Asian accented shipmate.  In the long run, what might hurt Blood Wake is its simple gameplay.  Blood Wake boasts a good number of missions (20 plus) but there's not a whole lot of variety for each mission and the action can get a bit repetitive at times.  This fact isn't helped that you don't receive weapons while fighting and the inability to customize your ships with different weapons.  Controls are pretty solid for the most part but sometimes when I try to make a tight turn my ship will start turning backwards.  It would've been interesting to have more interaction with the backgrounds and there's doesn't seem to be any type of ramming play mechanic applied to the game.  But overall, Blood Wake doesn't try to be anything more than a game where you get to blow up things really good.  Add great water physics, exciting visuals, and a solid multiplayer mode and you don't have to search to hard for a great vehicular combat game - X marks the spot.  --Anthony Chau, IGN", "date": "Jan 4, 2002"}
