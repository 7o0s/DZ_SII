Slap some shades on the hero, give him some rocket boots and the transition is complete -- the Cro-Magnon caveman Bonk has become the turbo-charged cyborg Air ~Zonk.~   Hudson combined the best the TurboGrafx had to offer to ultimately produce this game, as the 16-bit system was mostly known for two things: first, its wealth of side-scrolling shooters. Second, the system's headlining mascot Bonk (not as popular as rivals Mario or Sonic in the early '90s, but still notable enough). Naturally, putting Bonk into a side-scrolling shooter has to result in the greatest game ever for the TG platform, right?   See? Shooting stuff with a bald guy was in before Hitman. Well, yeah, pretty close. Air ~Zonk~ may not be the absolute best title to come from the Turbo, but it is absolutely one of the strongest. It looks good, it sounds good, it plays very well and it has missiles wearing sunglasses -- that's a recipe for success.   You take control of Zonk flying through side-scrolling shooter levels, with each environment and every enemy presented in the same cartoony-cute style first seen in Bonk's Adventure. Zonk's armed at the outset with a standard gun, a charge shot that drops a screen-blasting bomb after five seconds or so, and a rear-attacking boot blaster that fires automatically when baddies get too close to the Z Man's feet.   Blasting the opposition makes power-up items appear, and Zonk can end up wielding all sorts of upgraded armaments -- from a heat-seeking missile launcher to a deck of playing cards. Most are parodical takes on the more standard weapon boosts you'd find in ~serious~ shooters like Blazing Lazers or Super Star Soldier. Air ~Zonk~ innovates, though, in its presentation of Team Cool.   Ten superhero sidekicks make up the team, the support force that works to assist Zonk in his many missions. The characters include a sentient gumball machine, a couple of dogs, a dump truck and a mummy, among others, and they can be called upon one at a time in the middle of Zonk's levels to soar in and help. At first, your chosen buddy will simply follow you around the screen and auto-fire a standard weapon. Collect enough smiley faces, though, and you can trigger the appearance of a fusion item that melds Zonk and his helper into one more powerful, more ridiculous being when he morphs with Moo Moo the cow-fish, for example, he gains access to a gun that fires canisters of milk. It does a body good.Overall, Air ~Zonk~ is wacky, ridiculous and frenetic -- everything you'd want from a cute-'em-up shooter -- and still stands as one of the finest TurboGrafx titles ever made. Enjoy flying through the skies of tomorrow with the crazed cousin of Hudson's head-butting caveman.", "date": "Jul 18, 2007"}
