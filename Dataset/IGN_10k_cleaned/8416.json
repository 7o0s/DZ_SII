He probably would have enjoyed Pinball FX on Xbox Live Arcade. Tommy was also deaf, blind and mute. That may be the requirements for finding satisfaction in Zen Studios' overpriced offering. At 800 Microsoft Points (US$10), pinball enthusiasts get three mediocre boards, a couple-hundred Achievement Points, and little else.   As my college test scores can attribute, I spent a lot of my early adult life playing pinball games. I had a fondness for old pinball cabinets that were a tad cheesy and had perhaps a little less flash than the new wave of machines that were creeping into the last few arcades in America. So when I saw Pinball FX for the first time, I felt a little tingle in my flipper fingers. Turns out I was just moments from a stroke.    For the most part the physics in Pinball FX hold up, but there are a few issues that harm the overall experience. The ball is far too fast, unrealistically so. It's difficult to use a soft touch in Pinball FX. The flippers are also too strong. I've yet to pull one of the most basic pinball moves in the repertoire: The flipper pass. Because the ball is eager to launch into the stratosphere at the slightest touch and the flippers kick strongly, it's virtually impossible to make a transfer between flippers. And that's an essential skill for anyone who wants to master a board. Fortunately, the ball has near-perfect interaction with the bumpers and other objects on the board. So while it suffers slightly from its speed, Pinball FX more or less gets it right.   The value of Pinball FX lies almost completely on the quality of its boards. After all, if the three boards aren't up to snuff, no amount of physics of pinball addictiveness is going to hold anyone's interest. The three boards (Speed Machine, Extreme, and Agents) are a mixture of good and bad. Speed Machine (a take-off on classic hotrod pinball cabinets) and Agents (a Bond riff) are enjoyable boards. The design could have been more imaginative for Speed Machine, but it's certainly good enough to drop a few virtual quarters into.    The bad comes with Extreme, a spoof (I hope) on overly-enthusiastic urbanism in games. The in-your-face board comes complete with offensive sound bites and ridiculous ~street~ art. Even if you can stomach the obnoxiousness of this board, the design itself isn't very good. The center of the board is wasted and it's far too easy to enter a repeated loop.    If only Zen Studios had invested in some better art and a more appealing presentation package, Pinball FX might have come closer to being worth $10. The art, particularly in Agents, is bad. It doesn't help that the music is easily forgettable. A great game, even a good game, should immerse the gamer in the experience. How about some ambient sound so I feel like I'm in an arcade? Why not create an online virtual experience where gamers are playing in the same arcade?   Speaking of online play, there's a decent four-player online component in Pinball FX. Each gamer plays on the same board, attempting to be first to reach whatever point goal has been set. Losing a ball down the gutter costs a percentage penalty of your points earned. This creates a frantic pace, where everyone is pressured to score quickly while avoiding eating it in the gutter. It's a better experience than playing alone. However, Zen Studios could have done a better job placing the icons for other gamers so that the competition is easier to follow in the heat of the moment.  As a brief distraction, Pinball FX isn't a bad choice (particularly if you have Microsoft Points to burn). I'd be far more enthusiastic if Zen Studios had licensed a few classic boards or at least offered a couple extras beyond the three included in the initial download. While the ball physics aren't perfect and the Extreme board isn't worth playing more than a few times, there's enough here to at least merit a download of the free demo. If you're a pinball nut (or perhaps it's better if you're not), Pinball FX might tickle your fancy. There's just not enough here to merit the cost.", "date": "Apr 27, 2007"}
