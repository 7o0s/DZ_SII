I've been playing it with my friends, with co-workers, and all of them end up saying the same thing, ~Can we just play Blitz?~ On the other side of the coin, if you're a big NFL Xtreme fan, and you've been waiting for something new and improved, well, this year's NFL Xtreme, numero dos, will definitely please you. 989 Studios has kept in all the necessary sim features to keep this a football game. NFL Xtreme 2 has four modes of play: Quick Start, Season, Playoffs and Tournament. The game also has a ton of extra roster features including a create/trade a player mode, roster depth charts, sign and release player options, there's even a build your own team feature. The question is, will people even use any of this? Do they even care? I think the majority won't, and they'll just want to stuff their cleats into another guy's head, but I figured I should mention the little extras.  Anyway, the game does have a lot of improvements when compared to 989's last attempt. For starters, the complaint from the last go-around was the lack of violent moves. This time, I have to admit, the game is a lot more exciting. On-field players can swing one another from their arms, can do flips over each other, some can even pick them up and give them a back-breaker -- we needed this stuff in the first one. but that's about the only fun aspect that I can brag to you about.  The problem with NFL Xtreme in general is that this series really doesn't offer much to the arcade-sports genre. There's nothing outstanding that separates it from the Blitz franchise. And although this game looks a whole lot better than last year's run, still, Blitz plays and feels a whole lot better. I was bored playing this game and I'm already bored talking about it.  Like I said, if you enjoyed the first NFL Xtreme, you'll definitely love this game. It's such a big improvement. More taunts, tons of new moves, better graphics. But still, this game doesn't even come close to capturing the kind of arcade excitement as NFL Blitz does.  So on that note, if you like arcade action, minus the flags and penalties, get NFL Blitz. If you enjoy the hardcore NFL experience, with referees and all, get GameDay or Madden. But if you want an odd mix of the two, then I guess NFL Xtreme is your best bet.  If you want to get into the huddle and Under the Helmet of real NFL football, head over to NFL.com. With live chats, real-time audio and interactive polls, you can experience NFL action like never before. Here's my two cents on NFL Xtreme 2. I didn't like the first one, and the second one, hmm, same reaction. The problem with this franchise is that it doesn't quite capture the 'arcade' experience that NFL Blitz does. The first NFL Xtreme, lacked violence, had cruddy visual effects, and, well, it just wasn't exciting. Now the second one comes along. More moves, doesn't look that bad, but still, it really doesn't bring anything that NFL Blitz hasn't already brought to the field. The first one was such a turn off and trying to get into to the second one was a real challenge. What stinks is that the game isn't bad, and I hate to be redundant, but the game is just dull. In the review above, it basically states that if you're a fan of the franchise, you'll really like NFL Xtreme 2. However, if you already own NFL Blitz, and you're yearning for something new, this isn't the game to get. There just isn't enough there to justify a purchase. NFL Xtreme 2 would've been a better game if it came out a year ago -- it's just a little too late in the game, as they say, for this franchise. Maybe next time. Here's a suggestion for the next one, try adding some weapons, or like, landmines, or something. That would add some much-needed fun to the game.", "date": "Jul 27, 1999"}
