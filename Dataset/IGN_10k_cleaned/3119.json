One way is to come up with an original and seemingly revolutionary idea, which leads to many years of fairly risky work. Sometimes, that shiny new idea will turn out to be something that gives birth to a new genre of games, and that idea ends up paying off heavily. Doom, The Sims, Grand Theft Auto 3... Those games all have a place in videogame history, and their designers have plenty of shiny cars to show for it.   Those risky ideas will sometimes not turn out so great, or even worse for the paying publisher, rack up years upon years of development costs, only to be overlooked when the game is finally released. Since these grand ideas can be so risky, developers will sometimes look towards a second major way that games are designed, which is to basically take a well-known and profitable design, and tweak it a little for their own brand new game. While these games don't really break any new ground, the buying public will likely be comfortable with that type of gameplay already, and may be comfortable with spending their money on something tried and true.   So that brings us to Jet X2O, which borrows heavily from many other well selling and liked games. SSX and Wave Race come to mind fairly quickly. While those are both excellent games, in the end, Jet X2O doesn't really try to do anything new at all, and so it comes off as just another basically average and forgettable game.   Gameplay  If the game's title doesn't hint enough at its basic idea, then I'll elaborate. Jet X2O is a combination racing and stunt performance game, where players race a jet ski through plenty of varied and exaggerated courses. As stated before, the game is basically a mish-mash of  SSX and Wave Race, so if you've played either of those games, you'll have a good idea of what this game is about.   The selection of characters and watercrafts is about standard for this sort of game, with plenty of options once you've unlocked some stuff. The characters fit the same bill as those in SSX or games like it, where the cast is filled with an assortment of exaggerated personalities from all over the globe. None of them standout as being amazing feats of character design, but at the same time they aren't annoying, either.   Since the game has its design roots buried deep in some old classics, the control scheme feels pretty natural right away, and it's easy to get going right away. The left analog stick steers, X is gas, and Square uses whatever boost you may have earned, which is earned by performing tricks and running through certain markers. Tricks are performed by pressing L1, L2, R1 or R2, or any combination of those buttons. Pressing Square while performing a trick will tweak it. For example, the HeartAttak may be tweaked into a One Handed HeartAttak, and those tricks are worth more points, but timing is more important as they take longer to recover from.   You can also perform barrel rolls and flips by pressing one direction then another. Quickly pressing left on the analog stick and then right will perform a clockwise barrel roll. Pressing up then down will perform a backflip. You can also subdive by quickly pressing down then up while on water, which will send your watercraft and rider underwater for a second or two, and then they'll pop out and catch a little air.   The controls generally feel pretty good. The watercrafts react like they should on water, and movement and tricks are fairly responsive. Performing barrel rolls and flips can be a little touchy sometimes, but that's fine since the other tricks are all very easy to perform, and a bit of a challenge is always welcome. Turning and navigating the waves properly takes a little practice in order to get your lap times down, but for the most part, the watercrafts react well.   Tricks are simple to perform, so the only thing that needs practice there is timing. The longer that tricks are held, and the more that you can fit into any given jump, the higher the score that you'll earn, but some tricks take a while to recover from, so timing is pretty important. The ease of actually performing the tricks is one of the things that make the game fairly unexciting to play. There's not really a challenge in any of it, and once you learn when you need to get back on the watercraft, performing tricks becomes redundant and boring.   The game has three basic types of play. World Tour is the main single player mode, which is where you take a racer through a series of tracks, unlocking new tracks, stats and decals for your watercraft, new characters and more. World Tour is played in the Combo Mode system of scoring, where race time and trick performance plays in to your overall score. There are equal points awarded for both race time and trick total, so you'll need to combine quick race times with lots of stunts in order to advance. One thing that didn't really make any sense about this mode is what was needed to advance. Even if you race reasonably well and score high enough in one particular race to keep you on top of the leader board, you still may not qualify for the next track, and will have to race that course over again. The necessary point total is shown before each race, so you'll know exactly how you must perform to move on, even if it's better than what you think you'd need to stay on top of the leaderboard.    Aside from World Tour, there's also the Single Event mode, where you can race one course in Combo Mode, Race Mode or Trick Mode. Race Mode strictly counts your race time, while Trick Mode is all about your stunt total. During Trick Mode, you race alone, and are given a couple minutes of time to start with. It's not enough to reach the end of the track, but you're given more time as you pull off big stunts. Trick Mode also adds more ramps to each course than are in either the Combo or Race Mode. Lastly, there's a Big Wave option, which puts you in an area where you can practice tricks, handling the watercraft, and subdiving.   One of the better parts of Jet X2O is the length of each course. Most races will last around four or five minutes, and they're all one long course, as opposed to a smaller course with laps. After some basic math, each course should figure out to be around five miles long or so, which is a fairly long length. The courses range from wooded areas to snowy mountainsides to the jungle, and most have at least a few enormous jumps where plenty of tricks can be racked up, along with plenty of smaller jumps. The track design is fairly decent, but nothing earth shatteringly good, either.   The game lets you play in 2 Player mode in everything except for the World Tour. The game performs reasonably well in split screen mode, though there is a bit of slowdown from time to time, but it's not too bad.   Graphics  The game's graphics are at about the same level as the rest of the game, which is to say that they work, but at the same time, there really isn't anything that stands out. The environments, characters and watercrafts are all displayed in a reasonable manner, and what style the game has comes across fairly well. A fair amount of polygonal detail is given to everything, and texture work is also decent. Characters show plenty of muscle tone and facial features, while the levels have a fair amount of ~filler~ stuff. Lots of trees align the banks of wooded areas, with rocks and whatnot jetting out of the waterway. The snowy course has a fair amount of glaciers, stalagmites in caves, and other necessary extras to make the environment feel right.   The water's movement is fairly subtle on the default Amateur setting, but it picks up a bit when the game is set to the Pro level. Watercraft movement is effected nicely by it on the Pro level, and the crafts will cause their appropriate wake and general displacement. The amount of movement in the water varies from area to area in each level, though some of the activity seems a little oddly placed. Small streams will sometimes have very chaotic water movement, which looks a little odd. For the most part though, the water works reasonably well, and looks about the same.   Sound  If you've played any other average extreme sports game with a generic soundtrack, you know how this game sounds. The music isn't annoying, but it's entirely background stuff to make the game sound a little louder. The water sometimes has some nice sound effects affiliated with it, although the samples occasionally don't quite seem to match what you see. It's a little hard to explain, but the water might sound a bit too clear at times, while there should be more engine noise added into the mix. It's not anything bothersome, it's just another thing in the ~Not great, but not bad list.~   Each character has their own set of taunts, reactions and so forth that they're all too happy to spout out during the race. While it's meant to be funny, and it might make a small muscle in your stomach twitch a tad bit at first, it becomes old fairly fast. The character speech is yet just another completely forgettable aspect of this game.  While there's nothing that's exactly bad about Jet X2O, there's nothing that's really good, either. It plays like an OK version of SSX set on water. Those people who loved Splashdown or Wave Race may enjoy this one for a bit, but most people will likely find it too average to pay much attention to it.", "date": "Oct 29, 2002"}
