Strangely, this classic puzzle game has yet to make an appearance on cellphones, so Sega Mobile has taken it upon themselves to publish what is the most unabashed, almost impressively so, clone of a popular game ever. Features: Classic puzzle action Multiple levels High score board  We're not exactly sure what constitutes grounds for video game plagiarism, but Break the Eggs seems to offer enough ammo to whomever currently holds the license for Bust-a-Move.  Replace BAM's colored orbs with pastel eggs and the DaVinci-designed cannon (piloted by a dinosaur) with a simple stick, and you have Break the Eggs .  They play almost exactly the same--shamelessly so.  What that means then, is that Break the Eggs is fun.  The concept of BAM is rock-solid, and this clone manages to be just as entertaining, depsite not being much to look at.  The playing field is a dull blue screen, with ~blah~ looking eggs hanging from the top.  The stick-figure egg cannon is decidedly plain.  Why didn't developer Spot Wireless didn't take an extra day or two to spruce up the joint, knowing company would soon be over?  Unfortunately, Break the Eggs is a pure single-player experience.  It rewards you with points for big combos, but somehow it's not as fulfilling as dumping garbage on an opponent.  Hopefully, a version 2.0 of Break the Eggs (should Taito not manage to force Sega Mobile to yank this clone out of the digital ether), will allow for some multiplayer, as newer cellphones are able to pull off that feat.  The audio is as limited as the visuals.  A quiet ~swish~ is heard when you launch and egg, and church bell chimes let you know you have indeed managed to break a few eggs to make an omelette. Yowza.  Not since the height of the Pac-Man revolution have I seen such a brash copycat.  Download it before it goes away, if not for posterity, but to enjoy what is one of Sega Mobile's better offerings.  Graphics whores will likely turn their noses up at Eggs, but then again, graphics whores shouldn't be playing this first-gen of color cellphone games.  Ai Ai's Funhouse may look better, but Eggs has it all over it in the all-important game play department, proving that visuals really do mean nothing.", "date": "Apr 28, 2003"}
