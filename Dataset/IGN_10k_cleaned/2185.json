Exakt's racer is the kind of game that any racing fan or car fanatic would dream of making. First, you get to drive some of the most exotic automobiles in the world, including the Lotus M220, Callaway C12, Fioravanti F100, Pagani Zonda C12s, Vision CTEK K/2, Bertone Pixster, Rinspeed E-Go Rocket, and Pontiac Concept GTO. And if none of those dream machines are to your liking, the game lets you create and customize your very own race car in its unique Styling Studio.  In the Styling Studio, players can blend multiple fronts, rears, and body styles with each other to make the ultimate supercar. In addition to deciding on the basic look, you'll also be able to pick items like your wheels, spoiler, headlights and paint color and as you progress through the game with your created car, you'll earn the ability to change even more things. It's fairly robust and you can pretty much style your car any way that you wish.   Gameplay The problem with all this is that beyond the cool cars and the fun create-a-car mode, there's just not much depth to this game. Sure, there are a lot of tracks -- 23 courses set in areas like London ,Paris, Monaco, Los Angeles, Munich and Rome -- and there's a variety of single- and multi-player gameplay modes, but the actual on track racing leaves a lot to be desired.  The game is 100% arcade-styled racing without a hint of sim, and while that might be all fine and dandy, the arcade racing that the game offers is pretty amateurish. There's just not enough depth to the driving and racing in the game to give you any long-term fun in the game. If you've ever played a racing game before, you'll most likely be able to jump right in and win just about every race that you try, without having to worry about the track you're racing on or the car you're driving. Yes, the sensation of speed is there, there's enough camera angles, and the races can be fun at times, but it just doesn't last that long because of the fact that there's so little skill involved in winning.   Graphics The visuals might have been acceptable for a first-generation PlayStation 2 game, but they don't quite hold up to what we've been seeing on the system of late. The infamous PS2 jaggies and flicker are as apparent here as much as any other game before it and all this is made worse by low-res and flat background textures, some pop-up in certain levels, and occasional slowdown.   It's not all bad, though, as there are some nice reflections, some of the car models actually look good and the framerate is generally solid. But, the bad definitely outweighs the good by a large margin. And the bottom line is that this isn't a graphically impressive racing game.   Sound Even though all techno music seems to sound the same, there's a fine line between what's good techno music and bad techno music. The techno you hear in the Wipeout games is what you can consider good, while the music you get to listen to here in Supercar Street Challenge is what you can consider bad. The music is very repetitive, uninspiring and simply not fun to listen to or, more importantly, to race to.   The sound doesn't get much better when you move past the music and into the general audio effects. The engine sounds lack punch and don't offer the granularity of real-life engines when it comes to the noise they make when upshifting or downshifting.  I had some really high-expectations for this game and that might be one of the reasons that I'm so disappointed with it. The idea behind the game is amazing and the features offered are more than adequate. However, where this game fails is where it needed to succeed the most -- the racing. Racing around these various tracks in either the real of self-made supercars should be a lot more fun than this and it's a travesty that it isn't. I honestly could've looked past the flaws in the graphics and sound if the racing required at least some skill or was just a little more fun to play. As is, there's no reason to buy this game.", "date": "Oct 24, 2001"}
