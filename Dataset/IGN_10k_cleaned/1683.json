{"name": "Dino Crisis", "name_review": "Dino Crisis", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/12/22/dino-crisis", "text": "I'm all for more console games on the PC -- it saves all of us money in the long run, and gives us an opportunity to play titles like Metal Gear Solid, Rayman 2, and Soul Reaver in higher resolutions, and with pixel-perfect framerates. Of course, that's if the developer chooses to work the assets of the PC platform. There's also the downside, a sludgy, muddy world filled with such horrors as Resident Evil 2 and Final Fantasy VIII. You don't need glasses, that's pure, unfiltered blur you see before you. While Capcom's latest PC port, Dino Crisis, fares better than most due to its polygonal engine, it still suffers from a serious case of port-i-tis that keeps it from even sporting a glimmer of gloss against this year's models, Quake Team Arena, Sacrifice, and Alice.  It's not that Dino Crisis is a great game stuck in a PlayStation package, either -- the gameplay itself apes another Capcom title, Resident Evil, so much that you'll wonder if you're not just playing an expansion. It's no wonder, considering that both games were crafted by the same designer. That being said, if you've enjoyed shooting zombies, looking for keys, looking for codes with keys, and watching opening door animations, than you'll be sated and satisfied with what's offered in Dino Crisis. Squint your eyes and you can even imagine the Raptors as Zombies with lymph-node problems.  The game does have its share of style, however, particularly in the form of Regina, a strong-willed, red-haired leader of the elite task force that forms the foundation of the game. Sure, we've seen her type a million times over the last few years, and the slack voice-acting attached to her character doesn't help, but as a total package she keeps you interested in the action, long after the action leaves your interest. The plot certainly doesn't help any -- you're called in to investigate a secret research project gone awry on a tropical island, headed by Dr. Kirk, an energy research authority who was previously presumed dead from an accident. You land to investigate, and soon find yourself the prey of a completely new set of predators. Sound familiar? If the gameplay comes off as a Resident Evil clone, the plotline certainly doesn't veer away from Jurassic Park all that far, either. But you do get to shoot a grenade launcher into a T-Rex's mouth, so I guess you can only complain so much.  The biggest difference from the Resident Evil series is the fact that the game is completely polygonal, as opposed to throwing 3D characters over 2D pre-rendered backgrounds. After the sludgy resolution of PlayStation pre-rendered fare like Final Fantasy VIII on the PC, I'm happy to say that everything on screen is nice and crispy (we'll get to the menus later). What this also means is that the camera has a lot more access to control plot points, such as switching angle with a moving camera, or following you as you run down a hall, or around a corner. It does a great job of controlling the plot while keeping things a little more active, something I feel RE always falls short with.   Good cameras don't make good games, however, and while Dino Crisis certainly gives you a lot to do in the adventure, none of it feels fresh, particularly if you've played Alone in the Dark, RE, Silent Hill... and the list goes on. You explore room after room of the research complex, listen for dino noises, fire off a few rounds, and generally look for a million keys for a million doors. Did we mention you write down a lot of numbers for keycodes as well? While the dino-elements can be very interesting, such as when a rampaging T-Rex slams its head through a window and chomps down on a researcher, the action is still the same as ever: run away. You'll fire if you have to, but most likely you won't want to bother, due to the survival horror genre's horrible sense of action. I've always felt that the worst thing about all these games was the lack of solid aiming, or interesting combat due to the stilted nature of the camera angles, and this one did nothing to convince me otherwise.  Dino Crisis introduces the customization aspect to the weapons and ammunition, allowing you tweak weapons to handle different ammunition, or mix chemicals to form antibiotics or sedative to heal you, or help in combat. Unfortunately I rarely used this extra, due to the fact that I was too busy being a paranoid freak and conserving all my ammo for the three or four super-insane bosses in the game, something I learned from back in my Resident Evil days. Still, it's nice to see some tweaking going on with the formula... though why oh why are there still those horrible ~door-opening~ animations every time you walk up stairs, or head to the next tiny area? It's beyond annoying. Add to this the fact that you'll once again have to find keys for doors until the end of time, and the repetition will quickly begin to set in, great dinosaurs or no great dinosaurs.  There are some good creep moments and scares though, something that the genre does better than anyone else. You'll get your share of sliced and chewed bodies, don't you worry. And the camera works perfectly to set the mood for scenes, and to keep you constantly on your toes. For instance, your first attack from a dinosaur is handled in a mixture of quick cutscenes and playable action, showing the view from the dinosaur, then putting you back in Regina's shoes to outrun the deadly beast, then putting you back into another horror angle to bring the tension even higher. It's a great moment, and illustrates the strongest strengths of Dino Crisis.  How does it looks, though? Choppy. The textures are crisp but lacking detail because of the PlayStation resolution, and there are seams everywhere, particularly in the characters themselves. While much less noticeable on the PlayStation, it's a nightmare on the PC. For all the good environmental and character design, it's still pretty hard on the eyes, especially when you get close enough to objects to notice just how pixilated the details can really become. Blown up directly from 320x240 to the resolution of your choice, the menu system features full effect port-o-vision, featuring blurred details and hard-to-read text. While it won't kill it, and doesn't ruin a large chunk of the game in general, pair it with the other members of the port-tastic team like the mysterious ~where's the exit key~ quandary, and ~the install menu seems to be in English, but why can't I understand anything~ and you've got sadness, pure and simple.  The sound effects for the gunfire and dinosaurs are top notch, but the whole game is brought down by some pretty horrific voice-acting. How Capcom can get Americans/Canadians to do stuff like pronounce intestines intestInes, I'm not sure, but they've got it down to a science now. PC games have some of the best voice acting ever this year, and it's hard to go back to the ancient days of marketing people and engineers with baritones voicing major characters in games.   Dino Crisis isn't all that original, and on the PC it isn't all that original, and isn't pretty at all. The menu system is sludgy and antiquated, the gameplay is slow-paced an repetitive, despite some really inventive moments, and the voice-acting leaves a lot to be desired. Like I said, I love to see console games ported over to the PC. I just like to see them done well.  -- Vincent Lopez      Want to share your opinions with the world?
