So this time around to spare Dan the hatemail, the EIC asked a guy who actually liked Diablo II to review the expansion pack. So, as a fan and a critic, I have to say the Lord of Destruction is really good -- Blizzard really revised, tweaked, and added features that will make it a ~must buy~ for any fan, but there are some serious caveats (actually, only one big one) that you need to be aware of before diving straight in.  About 80% of the improvements are gameplay oriented, and all of them are good. There are around 20 or so additions -- ranging from the ~Repair All~ button at the smithies to new Horadric Cube recipies -- but I'll concentrate on the big four: the new stash, weapons swapping, hirelings, and new items. My favorite so far has been the increased character stash -- it's twice the old size, enabling you to stash a lot more items than you used to. It seems minor, but any experienced campaigner has experienced the agony of throwing perfectly good jewels and helms away. Now, instead of it being something like a medieval version of a dorm closet, your chest is capable of acting as a real cache, capable of fully outfitting your character with new weapons, potions, charms and the like when you die, which is very nice.  In addition to the stash, the ability to swap between weapons will quickly be appreciated. With it, characters can equip for various situations, whether you need to switch from a defensive sword-shield combo to two-handed all out offense or from short range to long-range, you can now swap with the touch of a hot key, where before you had to run away to re-equip. Plus, it gives you two more slots to store equipment.  However, when all is said and done, the most significant change has been to how Diablo II handles hirelings. Before, when you won or purchased a hireling, their pitiful armament and tendency to get caught by hordes of attackers made them nothing more than really expensive bait. Now, in LOD, they're like pseudo-characters. You can equip them with weapons and armor, they gain experience, and you can heal them. This turns them from dominoes into very valuable allies. Nothing helps like a well-armed Rogue when you're a melee fighter, or a big, brawny barbarian when you're a magician type.  Finally, what's an expansion pack without new items? If you're a sucker for weapons and armor, then you've got more choices than ever -- Blizzard's added more types and descriptions, including class-exclusive and exceptional items, so much so you'll thank them for the larger stash while you're making up your mind. Perhaps the most intriguing addition to the bunch are the charms -- ability enhancers that work when they're in your backpack. Makes you decide between leaving more space for stuff, or putting more charms in. Character Study 101: The Two New Classes  Lord of Destruction introduces two new classes: the Assassin and the Druid. The Assassin, as most of you will know by now, is a melee-type fighter that uses magic to enhance her damage. Her main focus is in martial arts and traps -- the martial arts give her attacks with highly enhanced damage, while traps give her distance attacks. This sounds pretty cool, but she's kind of boring. The finishing moves do a lot of damage, and work well, but they work in conjunction with so many other skills that it's hard to concentrate your points, thus becoming well-rounded but weak. The shadow disciplines, especially the later ones, seem like pale imitations of other classes. And finally, the traps are good for tight corridors, but in wide open spaces, they're pretty useless. In the end, the Assassin's an okay character, but one that's not too much fun to play.  The Druid, on the other hand, is a blast, almost too much so. He seems to have been designed as a Necromancer mixed with a Barbarian, but he's so much more than that. Unlike the Assassin, the Druid's upgrade path is very clear yet diverse -- for example, enhancing shapeshifting gives you long-lasting conditional spells that enhance your capabilities as a percentage. Doesn't sound like much, but when you're a fairly low-level werewolf or werebear, you can almost double attack ratings or power, it's amazing what you can accomplish. Likewise, the Druid's summoning capabilities are cumulative -- every bear or wolf skill point applies to every  bear or wolf-type summoned, so that even your lower level creatures are incredibly powerful. Finally, should you go the elemental route, you have great spells that work in close quarters or open fields. As a side note, my Druid's never even come close to dying. The Druid is almost too good to play -- however, the last few patches have been toning down the Druid's shapeshifting spells. New Horizons: Mt. Arreat:  Aside from the gameplay enhancements, the new quest's been added, and while it's still ~clickclickclickclickclick~ action, it's tightly focused. The entire campaign is structured around a mountain, and it feels like it. You start out in the town of Harrogath, which is under siege by Baal's minions. The first quest: destroy the catapults laying siege to the town. Then it's off to rescue barbarian prisoners, and so and so forth. It feels like you're fighting your way up (or through, or down) the mountain, and the action evolves around that. The new monsters are cool, and while the environments aren't as destructible as you'd hope, you can still destroy enough gates and walls to make a difference in the campaign. Graphic Glitches:  Here's the big caveat. While Blizzard has up-rezzed the graphics so they'll operate in 800x600 mode, the programmers have done something to them so that the framerate is notoriously uneven, chopping up at inappropriate times to the point that you think you're watching a slideshow. It seems to happen most when there's a lot of action, but that's not always the case. It will happen in the last act, though. It's notoriously inconsistent, and I know it's not because of the hardware, because we're running off high-end 600MHz PCs with GeForce and GeForce 2 cards, and they were all the same. Now I won't say that'll hold true for everybody's systems, but it's happened often enough that I wish Blizzard had left the graphics at 640x480, because systems that were able to run Diablo II before now have problems regardless which video mode is chosen. Use at your own risk.  In the end, if you didn't like Diablo II before, you won't like Lord of Destruction any better. On the other hand, if you liked it, everything about this expansion is a huge improvement. -- Jeff Chen      Want to share your opinions with the world?
