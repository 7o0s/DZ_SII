However, a few game developers out there managed to get a little spooky on the 2600 -- and one of them was Xonox. Best known for their ~Double Ender~ series of two-game cartridges, pulled off something special with Ghost Manor. This was a genuinely creepy little game that worked inside the Atari 2600 technical limits, offering some deliciously crunchy sound effects and some chilling atmospherics.   Ghost Manor tells the tale of a young couple that is pulled apart one night in a haunted cemetery. In a script flip, you are the young woman rescuing the boyfriend -- a refreshing alternative. You must somehow enter the titular manor and stave off a vampire lord in order to reclaim your lost love.   The adventure unfolds over five screens, which is quite a lot for the 2600. In the first screen, you must chase a ghost around the cemetery. Every time you and the ghost touch the same gravestone at the same time, you earn a spear. Once you have 25 spears, it's off to the manor facade, which is guarded by an axe-chopping mummy. You must eliminate all of the monsters outside (bats, etc.) with the 25 spears without getting sliced by the mummy. Then, you head inside the manor. You must search the coffins on the bottom two floors of the manor to find crosses. A wall slowly moves back and forth and if you are too slow or get caught, the wall pinches you to death. (Conversely, if you push the wall as it moves away from you, you earn extra points.) The final screen is inside the vampire's lair. You must hold down the fire button to bear one of the crosses and force the vampire into one of the two towers. Once the vampire is sealed, you guide your boyfriend to the stairs for a reunion back outside.   Chasing the rainbow ghost in Ghost Manor.  Ghost Manor was one of my faves as a kid and it's good to see the game stands up to time. It's still a fairly difficult little action game -- especially the shooting sequence. But what surprised me was the not only did I remember the horror-show opening theme, but it still sounds awesome. Xonox did a great job with mood. The lightning strikes, the angry mummy, the manor in the background of the cemetery... it was much more effective than other so-called horror games like Texas Chainsaw Massacre. You can hear the game and see footage of it being played here.  Ghost Manor was one of those games I was nervous to check back in on. It's never fun to see a childhood favorite crushed. Fortunately, this early stab at horror held up remarkably well. With five screens, good graphics, and some great audio, Ghost Manor deserves to be sought out by Atari 2600 collectors everywhere.", "date": "Mar 17, 2008"}
