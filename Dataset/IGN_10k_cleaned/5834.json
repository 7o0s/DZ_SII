{"name": "Battlefield 2", "name_review": "Battlefield 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/06/19/battlefield-2", "text": "The Battlefield series is a favorite around the office at IGN. It offers up a unique shooter experience that you don't find elsewhere in a ~realistic~ setting. Vehicles and infantry move realistically, and weapons have firing cones and rates that mimic actual life fairly closely (balanced for fun, of course). More importantly, the pace of the game is undeniably fun, and the ~Battlefield moments~ like helicopters getting sideswiped by planes, tanks exploding, bodies catapulting across the sky, and so on, are all so frickin' cool that it's near impossible to stop playing. Battlefield 2 is a lot like the original 1942, in that respect. But this time around, the developers at DICE and publishers at EA have set out to create a more team-oriented experience with their official sequel, and they've done a terrific job at that.    Battlefield 2 is a great game. After playing for quite a few hours (often shirking other responsibilities), I and pretty much everyone else here at IGN will heartily recommend BF2 to fans of the series and beg those who haven't played before or didn't like the original to give the demo a whirl. Any game that can make a large group of editors take a Saturday and play for 14 hours straight until 4:30 in the morning has to be pretty awesome... It's just not perfect.   Battlefield 2 is set in the near future, where plausible conflicts between the US and both China and the Middle East Coalition (a fictional faction) flare up. Most of the battle locations seem to center around oil fields, refineries or dams, which makes a kind of sense given the conflicts. Each of these areas also comes with a small description about the purpose of the map, which helps explain things a bit.   Twelve different locations make Battlefield's battlefields. Maps aren't as diverse as I would have liked them to be but are still pretty well thought-out. Some environments are better than others in terms of gameplay, while a few simply look cool. Strike at Karkand, for instance, is an excellent map. It combines fast-paced gameplay with good amounts of strategy in an urban setting. It's got a claustrophobic appeal that makes the experience much more intense. It's a perfect map for tightly grouped infantry combat, and I suspect it'll become a favorite of those that prefer a match without a ton of huge vehicles. On the other side of the spectrum is Kubra Dam, which I have a strong distaste for. While the dam does look really cool (particularly when flying around in a helicopter), this particular map is a huge pain in the ass to navigate without a vehicle -- enough so that it creates a vortex of fun so that those of us in the office who have been playing now have little faith that it'll get any better with time.     The rest of the maps offer a varying degree of good and concentrate on various parts of the game, but it's easy to want more distinct environments. The maps in 1942 were more impressively diverse in nature than Battlefield 2's. They covered areas like Stalingrad, Berlin, the Battle of the Bulge, Wake Island, El Alamein, Midway... They all had a very different feel; you were on a different map every time you played. It's not as diverse this time around. Some of the maps feel very similar to others and, in fact, even look very similar to others. When you've got a fictional war between three factions, it seems like you could do whatever you wished with the creation of maps. Jerusalem, Europe, Russia, Indonesia, and Taiwan all come to mind as potential areas of interest. I suppose some of the relative lack of variety comes from the need to create art for each of the areas, and considering the higher detail, it might be a bigger task than before. Still, what is available ranges from good to excellent.   One of the more interesting things about each map in Battlefield 2 is that there are three versions, depending on the number of players participating. 16, 32 and 64-player flavors are all provided. The difference between 16 and 32-player fields is pretty huge. Maps set to 16 cut the size of the combat zone down considerably to allow players to find each other quickly and fight over a small number of total capture points. The differences between the 32 and 64 player maps can be less dramatic. While there are some maps that expand the territory noticeably, there are those that simply add a tiny amount (or no amount) of extra room along with a spawn point or two.    WATCH THE VIDEO REVIEW    While Battlefield 2 has certainly improved the series in many ways, it's surprising to see that the game has focused entirely on conquest mode again. This capture and hold game type really is an awesome mode of play, but unless the game has the right amount of people in each particular map, matches can turn into rounds of Whack a Mole. In less populated servers, players will simply run from flag to flag in circles without any hope of ever holding any of them. It's surprising then that a simple deathmatch mode isn't available. Honestly, I probably wouldn't use it, but I bet there are a bunch of people that would, now that kits are so much more expertly balanced. I suppose what I'm really sad about is that there aren't any objective modes like those found in the Return to Castle Wolfenstein games (modes where certain obstacles have to be overcome or destroyed before moving on in a level). These were always very interesting, and Battlefield 2 could have done an amazing job in implementing them.   Deathmatch and objective modes or not, BF2 does run very smoothly, given the right pipeline for bandwidth on the server side. Joining 64-player games doesn't really seem to create many problems, assuming that someone isn't trying to run the server on a DSL home line, anyway. I've certainly experienced some lag, but for the most part, it's pretty amazing how well the game runs.   On the other hand, BF2 is definitely a system hog. If you don't have a good amount of RAM and a decent video card, you'll really have to drop the detail to get the game to run smoothly. Given the right system, like our 3.4GHz, 2GB RAM, GeForce 6800 machines, BF2 can look really good, though -- some of the maps are certainly impressive looking, with great amounts of detail put on buildings, vehicles, weapons and characters. It's a real pleasure to play a 64-player game at 1600x1200 on high detail. True, lower detail settings really aren't pretty, but at least the game is still playable, which is the important part.   One thing these maps (and the conquest game type in general) do very well is promote the new team dynamic in Battlefield 2, which is absolutely excellent. Battlefield 1942 was an awesome game that will remain in our hearts and minds as one of the best multiplayer shooters ever created, but one thing it did lack was a cohesive group experience. While teammates were fighting next to each other, most of the time they were only fighting next to each other instead of with each other. DICE and EA have worked diligently to promote team play in this sequel and have done an admirable job of it.     A lot of the credit for this increased sense of team spirit goes to the keenly balanced kits. Each kit has an appropriate primary and secondary weapon to go along with that kit's specialty equipment (med-packs, wrenches and ammo packs, chiefly), so it behooves a group of people to gather with each other for the added support that a wide range of weaponry and kits can bring. For instance, medics can throw health packs on the ground or simply hold their med-pack in their hands to heal all teammates in the area. The same idea applies to support kits and their ammo packs. Meanwhile, the assault and anti-tank kits come equipped with heavy body armor and weapons more powerful than the support and medic classes so that they can do the brunt of the fighting. Engineers riding in vehicles will automatically repair other vehicles in their circle of influence as well, lending a lot of reason to include an engineer or two in any armored column. The point is, each of these classes has a purpose that belongs in a team-oriented game. Even the Special Ops, which I tend to think of as a lone wolf type character, is very useful for taking out enemy commander buildings and bridges and can be positively brilliant to have along when defending a flag, because of their C4 charges.    The one exception to this rule is probably the sniper class, which seems very underpowered. It's an interesting balance issue though, because you don't want snipers all over the place so that the game turns into Joint Operations, but you'd like them to be a little more useful. At least in 1942, they could spot for artillery. Because most snipers don't tend to be particularly deadly, they just seem fairly useless when put in the overall team-oriented context of the game, especially since they can't effectively capture flags and fight at close range.   Still, those that weren't so sure about the infantry combat in 1942 should be much happier this time around. Movements feel much better (especially with the addition of the sprint function) and weapons feel way tighter. The animations of each of the soldiers are especially impressive and provide a solid feel that definitely wasn't in 1942. In fact, everything is well animated, with the exception of guys dying in stationary gun emplacements. The only thing I've found that infantry should have to worry about is their legs clipping through buildings when prone. I've have killed those that lay prone too close to a wall and have had the same thing happen to me.    The balance of vehicles on the maps seems fairly good, most of the time. Frankly, for smaller games like the 16-player Strike at Karkand map, I wish tanks were left out of the equation completely. These smaller missions are where the infantry should really be the focus of the battle, and tanks tend to make everyone play classes that focus on anti-vehicle weaponry like mines, anti-tank and C4. Part of the problem is that tanks and vehicles in general seem to spawn too quickly for my tastes. Player and vehicle spawn timing pretty much allows the same person to grab a tank every single time upon re-spawning. And so actually destroying a tank makes little difference on these small maps when another one will simply roll into town momentarily. There should be a greater sense of victory when taking out an armored vehicle like that.   That said, the vehicles themselves not only look brilliant, but feel fantastic. Tanks are dangerous and thunderous, buggies are fun as hell to drive around, and helicopters can be incredibly graceful killing machines, once you get the hang of flying them around (and I'm living proof that learning is possible). All together, there's nothing as exciting as rolling into a defended area with a complement of vehicles, air support and infantry and then being met by a defense of equal strength.      Organizing all that would seem to be a problem, but the chain of command system helps the team dynamic function properly. With or without voice communication, the system works very well. Players can create squads of six members, allowing for a variety of kit combinations for specific purposes or just because they seem to work well together. At the helm of each squad is a leader that can invite people into the squad, talk to squad mates over VOIP or just give commands through the intuitive interface. Meanwhile, the squad leaders can request and receive orders from the top of the hierarchy and can also request supplies, artillery strikes and UAV intelligence. Using the radial command and request system is very easy and makes playing the game cooperatively a cinch.    Sitting on the tall chair of leadership is the commander, one of the great new additions to the Battlefield experience. Only one player from each team can be a commander and gets access to a screen that allows them to watch enemy movements and coordinate squads for attacks and defenses. The whole idea of the commander is an awesome one. It is a huge piece of the Battlefield puzzle and good commanders that are on top of their game can make a big difference in any battle. Getting into the position simply requires applying for the job at the beginning of a match. The server will elect the highest ranked official from those who applied. If for some reason that commander is awful, players can mutiny and kick them in favor of a new leader. I've only seen this pulled off once, however, because the number of people that need to vote is pretty large, and many potential voters are probably too busy playing to notice the vote happening.    In the hands of the commander is an array of devices that can help squad leaders direct their squads more efficiently. Firstly, squads can be directed anywhere on the map. They can be told to simply move or attack and defend. Along with that, the commander can order in artillery strikes, use a radar scan to see enemy movements, call in supply crates (they heal, repair, and re-supply everything in range) and order a UAV unmanned reconnaissance drone out onto the field to show everyone on the team where enemies are in the immediate area.   These all add a lot to the experience and when squads are listening to the commander, it actually starts to feel like you're in a gamer army. It's really fun! The problem is the interface for the commander isn't exactly the prettiest or best designed thing in the world. Some of the information is confusing or simply missing. Commanders can't assign soldiers to squads to fill out the ranks, can't give orders to individual units not in a squad, and can't quickly differentiate who's in a squad and who's not.    It would also be great if commanders could place movement waypoints for squads, in order to tell them which direction to attack from or which route to take. Also, being able to send out basic announcements about bases being attacked would be great as well. What it really needed was functionality closer to that of an RTS. As it is, the commander mode is definitely an improvement over no commander mode, but it could have been done better.   Finally, commanders should not auto-balance to the other side under any circumstance. Not only is it disorienting to the commander, but everyone else on the team is suddenly left leaderless and probably won't even know it for a while.   Of course, everything I just said above regarding teamwork comes with the gigantic caveat that people actually use it and work together. If you've got a bunch of team killers, it's going to ruin your experience. This is, of course, true in any kind of multiplayer game so it's not a knock on Battlefield 2, but there are some issues with the punishment system that will probably have to be addressed. Commanders, for instance, can be punished for team killing idiots that run into their artillery strikes, which are very clearly marked on the radar. Likewise, idiots that run in front of a rolling tank can punish the driver for team killing. Frankly, I think the driver should be able to punish the dumbass that runs out in front of him, but I guess that's probably too much to ask. Part of that last problem is actually because vehicles do way too much damage to infantry. Barely nudging infantry by turning a tank can kill them, which is especially bad, considering you can't see the boundaries of your vehicle and who's around it when you're driving in the first-person. Either way, team killing is certainly a tough issue to solve when trying to keep the game fun.     What we've also seen in the demo and on random servers is that people don't really know what they're doing or how certain aspects of the game function, and so they simply stand around waiting for planes and neglect any orders given. I suppose free-flowing play still has its place, but it'll definitely be about finding a server where the players are serious about trying to play, regardless of their skill levels.    Along those lines, some of this probably could have been solved with a tutorial system where players ~graduate~ in order to use certain vehicles or become commanders. Seeing guys simply waiting for planes or helicopters in a game to practice flying while other folks are trying to play is a pain in the ass. While most people can figure out the basics of infantry and vehicular combat without much problem, they obviously have serious issues with both air vehicles and leadership. I actually would have liked to see little tutorial bits for each of the kits, vehicle types and leadership roles. By completing these, players could earn experience points which would open up the option to do those things in the actual game. There are some brief voiced help pop-ups that play the first time you come across something in the game, but those are of little value to those needing to learn the intricacies of control.    The only real options to learn without interference are creating empty LAN games and playing a singleplayer match. Lone LAN games are fairly boring, however, since no bots can be added, and singleplayer is pretty lame, as you can only play 16 player matches, which generally eliminates airplanes. While we're on the subject, those looking to buy Battlefield 2 as a strictly singleplayer game should be well warned that it's not made as one and barely even supports it. AI is sketchy (though much better than 1942), and only being able to play 16 player matches kind of defeats the purpose.   Back online, one of the really cool things about Battlefield 2 is its ranking system. The more players play and gain points (for kills, teamwork, and so on), the more they'll advance in rank. It's a reward in terms of knowing that you're the bees knees, but also because certain ranks grant players the chance to unlock new weapons for each of the kits. The unlocked weapons are standard across all factions, but they look and act differently than the normal weapons. Only one weapon can be unlocked at a time, so players will have to choose what looks best to them. It's nice to have an option available, especially because they aren't huge upgrades that unbalance the game.   All of the stats generated by the game will be uploaded to the database, and awards, medals and ribbons are handed out for actions taken on the battlefield. For instance, playing as medic for a little while will give you the Basic Medic Combat award. Very cool stuff.   Along with awards, players can check out a ton of other stats tracked by ranked servers (which will only be granted to certain server rental businesses because of security issues. And from what we've seen, these servers are expensive). All of this compiles to give you info about your kits, weapons, vehicles, teamwork and accuracy stats, to name a few. Looking through this stuff is addicting on its own. Sadly, players can't search for other players' stats anywhere in the interface. There's no search function for stats or for the leader boards, which is kind of baffling.   No search function only makes the absence of a friends list (or server favorite list) even more disappointing. While stats aren't the most important part of the experience, one of the first things all of us here at IGN tried to do was compare stats with each other. Unfortunately that meant running from desk to desk instead of being able to search for them or even search for position on leader boards.     The thing to remember about Battlefield 2 is that it's exceptionally fun. There are most definitely some things that need some improvement, but that certainly isn't going to keep the game from owning our lives for a good long while. Anybody that was a fan of Battlefield before will have a great reason to renew their love affair when the game is released early this week.", "date": "Jun 19, 2005"}
