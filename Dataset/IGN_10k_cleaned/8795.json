Add a few thousand more courses just like itdozens of which you've constructed yourselfand top it off with a ridiculously active online community just ready to toast your best scores, and you have a recipe for mania---Trackmania, that is.    Trackmania United is the most recent in a series of Trackmania games developed by French design studio Nadeo. It's a culmination of sorts, merging the environments from the original Trackmania (2003), 2005's Trackmania Sunrise, and 2006's Trackmania Nations, and incorporating multiplayer/online enhancements and visual perks. Indeed, if you haven't before taken the plunge, and even if you have, this is the version you want merely by virtue of its size and scope.     But what is it?   By simple definition, Trackmania United is an arcade racer. But it's so much more.   Hugely popular in Europe where it's been lionized as one of the greatest driving games in recent memory, but only recently gaining a strong following in North America, the Trackmania series has always emphasized, for want of a better description, lunacy. Like 1991's benchmark arcade driving game Stunts, it demands that you drive you car through all manner of condition and contraption on your way to the checkered flag. But there's one important distinction from the ancient Stuntsthese stunts are really out there.   Sure, it delivers standard loop the loops and jumps, but it's the size and magnitude and difficulty of each that really hits home. Air time is a huge factor in this game, and the physical sensation of hurtling over some of the game's more gargantuan chasms and screaming over sinewy ribbons of track elevated hundreds of feet in the air really sticks with you afterwards. To say your stomach does the same somersaults it does when you hop aboard that monster roller coaster down at the county fair is not overstating things.   And that's just the beginning. Imagine hitting the crest of a hill with absolutely zero visibility ahead, when out of nowhere you're expected to jump a Grand Canyon-size chasm, spin sideways through a couple of floating hoops, and land on a microscopic piece of track that isn't even lined up with the one you've left behind. Even worse, there's a massive pothole square in the middle of that landing pad threatening to drop you a couple hundred feet to the cold, hard ground below. Adding to your misery, there's a power boosting strip right in front of you that'll instantly slingshot you straight forward like Evil Knieval's rocket car, first into thin air and then splattering you into the side of a sheer cliff face, a la Wily E Coyote. The thought alone is enough to make a grown man wail like a little baby.     But not all the tracks ask you to defy the accepted laws of gravity. Indeed, the game offers up seven different global environments and seven different classes of automobileone for each environment. Sometimes, the courses involve straight-up speed, and ungodly amounts of it. Sometimes you'll find yourself on a snow bank or in the middle of thick, desert sand, struggling just to keep your car or truck from bogging down in the muck or flipping onto its roof. The variety is tremendous, and the excitement level is almost always high.   As for vehicle physics, let's just say Trackmania United won't contend for simulation of the year. Though its SUVs and trucks feel admirably distinct from its coupes, which in turn feel far less nimble and much slower than its open-wheeled Indy-style racecars, there's none of the subtle handling characteristics or inherent difficulty of a sim.    Generally, the vehicles respond quickly to your input and neither oversteer nor understeer. They drift through turns, and they are controllable whilst in the air. In short, they're a heck of a lot of fun, and just about anyone can drive at least moderately proficiently within a few minutes. And in a game like this, where the challenge lies elsewhere, you wouldn't want it any other way.   Hardcore realists should also note the game doesn't feature authentic perks such as a setup garage or upgrade shop. Truth is that each of the vehicles within each of the classes are identicalsave for their paint jobs, which can be customized quite brilliantly at any timeand aren't available for mechanical modifications of any sort. Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily, because the onus is placed squarely on the driver to pull every extra ounce of speed out of his car. Maybe Bernie Ecclestone and his mega-buck Formula 1 conceptwhere long, drawn-out processions are the ruleshould pay attention.   Moreover, the ~no mod~ rule really affects the online experience. Unlike the online component of most other racing games, where you inevitably face drivers who've set up or modded or cheat-ified their cars so spectacularly that you have no earthly chance of winning, Trackmania United is certainly a more equitable proposition.    Nadeo has also enforced a ~no-crash~ rule, whereby competitor cars are seen merely as ghosts. Though some will find the concept annoying, we bet just as many will jump for joy when they realize they can race in a multiplayer environment wherein idiots and bullies can't ruin the day by bashing and smashing their way around the courses. Of course, no crashes also means no damage modeling, and that's a shame.   Interestingly, Trackmania United isn't always about being first to the checkered flag. On some of the more, erimaginative courses in the game's ~Platform~ mode, you can take as long as your little heart desiresthe goal being to simply make it to the finish line with as few deaths and re-spawns as possible. This is much harder than you might think, particularly if you're attempting some of the merciless custom track concoctions floating around online. Words cannot do justice to your peers' level of cruelty.     In ~Puzzle~ mode, driving and track building disciplines are blended together into a unique IQ-style challenge that forces you to utilize your brain cells and problem-solving abilities as much as your racing ability. Using a predetermined number of track ~blocks,~ you try to piece together the most expeditious route between static start and finish points. The more puzzles you complete, the more difficultand the more deviousthey become.    Indeed, to some players, the game's track building utility may be the most intriguing aspect of all. There's really no limit to the size and style of the tracks you can build, and the construction process is just about as easy as it could be. However, like virtually anything else of consequence within the game, building a really good track will cost you. More on that in a moment.   So, what is it that will compel Trackmania returnees to swing by for another go? Sure, the game looks a little better than past editions. The frame rate is exceptionally fast throughout, slowing only momentarily when encountering an online traffic jam. The scenery is colorful, busy, and so varied from one environment to another you may think you're playing a different game. The lighting is superb, in that over-the-top way that so perfectly suits wild arcade racers. The vehicles are nowhere near as detailed or as animated as those you'd find in a game like Codemaster's DiRT, but they effectively look the part. And certainly the latest Trackmania is a humungous affairessentially combining all prior releases into one huge super-game. Yet the format and gameplay is essentially the same it's always been.     Fact is that the big draw for veterans may well be the slick integration of the massive online community. The moment you launch the program, you're logged in online. You can see all the latest stats and timeshighlighted by those within your own geographic regioncheck all the newest events and happenings, and watch the latest uploaded replays (a great idea for those who want to know not just why, but how, they suck). Any of the records you set, or any of the gold, silver, and bronze medals you win during your official laps are immediately noted and logged. And if you do want to join an event, you're just a few seconds from doing so.         Yet the real addictionthe sense that you need justonemorefixcomes from the game's cost and reward structure. In Trackmania United, almost anything of consequence costs you ~coppers,~ the game's virtual currency. When you race on a new track, for example, you have unlimited practice rounds, but your ~official~ laps will cost you a preset number of coppers. Yet it's during those official laps, and only during those official laps, where you can set records, establish your name in the online community, and win even more coppers. The more coppers you win, the more cool new stuff you can do, the more stuff you can download, and the more blocks you can use when building a new course. It's hardcore betting, without the gambling.   Sadly, the game doesn't sound particularly wonderful. Though the music changes right along with the environments, the song selection is limited. Though the engine notes vary from vehicle to vehicle, crash effects are almost inaudible. Other mechanical sounds are seemingly non-existent, and there's no real audible sense of the car that surrounds you.  Trackmania United is one honking big game that should appeal to anyone who gravitates to the wild and wacky style of arcade driving. Even fans of serious simulations would be hard pressed to cast aspirations on a title this strong. Granted, the actual cars and the control of such are not the stars of the show, but when a game is this much fun, this versatile, and this geared for customization and online interaction, unsatisfied customers will be few and far between.", "date": "Jul 19, 2007"}
