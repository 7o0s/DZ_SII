Now days we've got Resident Evil, Fade To Black, and now EA's latest acquisition OverBlood. Set in an underground base sometime in the future, OverBlood attempts to recreate the moodiness and horror of Resident Evil but never quite succeeds.  Your avatar, Raz Karcy, awakens from cryosleep in a mysterious base somewhere below the surface of the earth. He doesn't know where he is, who he is, or why he has such an unstylish beard. Our protagonist must find out who he is, why he has awakened, and just who put him to sleep in the first place. OverBlood sets the stage with these trite elements, and it's a premise that's been used too many times before.   The majority of the game is spent wandering through the drab corridors, opening doors. Every time a door opens, you're treated to a cutscene of a door opening. This happens quite often, and you can't skip past it as its a disc-loading place holder. Annoying to say the least.   OverBlood does have a few interesting points. For one, the graphics are quite good, if a little drab in color. The addition of two extra playable characters is also nice. You must switch back and forth between the three to reach places the others could not.  In the end, OverBlood doesn't live up to high standards set by its predecessors. You're better off waiting for Resident Evil 2.", "date": "May 20, 1997"}
