Both the Xbox 360 and Wii are already churning out retro games like there's no tomorrow and now PS3 is throwing its hat into the downloadable gaming ring. But instead of offering a crumby HD version of an ageing 'classic', PS3 owners are presnted with one of the greatest fighters to grace the PSP - Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection.   So, amidst a fanfare of grunts and the sound of fists crunching bone, Tekken 5 explodes onto the PlayStation Store, ready for the console's UK launch. This isn't some half-baked re-imagining of an archaic game from the '80s with a few bells and whistles strapped on, either; it's a fully-fledged fighting experience, with an impressive roster of brawlers, surprisingly decent graphics and Tekken's trademark addictive gameplay. Pretty amazing considering it's only 6.99 - almost 30 less than its PSP cousin.    So what do you get for you cash? Well, as we've already mentioned Dark Resurrection is one of the greatest handheld fighters around and, to be honest, it's probably even better here. The reason for this is largely down to the SIXAXIS pad - pulling off the high-kicking combos and powerful punches needed to secure your path to victory is easier on a full-sized joypad, plus there's not that reluctance to hammer the buttons that you get when playing on a delicate, expensive-to-replace PSP. You can grapple with the pad as hard as you like, knowing full well an overly-enthusiastic uppercut to Roger Jr's pouch won't cost you an arm and a leg.   But while it's obvious to make comparisons with the PSP title, it's worth noting that the PS3 version of Dark Resurrection is actually a port of the arcade game. And considering the arcade version was basically built on PlayStation 2 technology, Tekken 5 looks really rather sweet. The levels are detailed with lots going on in the background, the fighters move around the arenas fluidly and, when it's running through an HDMI cable on a HD TV, everything's given a little extra hi-def polish. Obviously it's not a game that's going to show off the PS3's graphical capabilities to their best - the fur on characters like Panda is pretty ropy, for example - but for a game built on PS2 tech that costs less than seven quid it's still very impressive.   But not everything is perfect with this arcade conversion. Anyone who's played Tekken 5 on PSP will be disappointed that modes like Command Attack or Gold Rush aren't included in this downloadable version, or in fact the original arcade game. While these additional games won't be sorely missed, the omission of a training mode is a far bigger problem. If you've never played a Tekken game before then it's almost totally inaccessible because there's no place to practice your moves. Even the basics aren't explained and the inclusion of a command list feels more like a token gesture for new fighters because it doesn't make up for the lack of a decent dojo or even a simple tutorial.    One PSP mode that does make it into this downloadable Tekken is the enjoyable Ghost Mode. Although the bog-standard arcade mode sees you just taking one fighter after another, in Ghost Mode you can choose your path and decide if you want to take on tougher opponents. It's meant to recreate the experience of being in a traditional arcade (without the smell of sweat or stained carpets), while taking on all comers of different skills. It does this fairly well - albeit in a simple way compared to Virtua Fighter 5's similar Quest mode - and is definitely the star of this downloadable package.   As well as letting you choose foes, Ghost Mode lets you earn virtual cash to unlock accessories for the different fighters, like a nice top hat for Armour King or a bookish pair of spectacles for Christie. Although all these items are quite silly, we guarantee you'll become bizarrely compelled to unlock every item for your favourite fighters. Due to this, Ghost Mode is where you spend most of the single player experience, just because you must have that Santa hat for Roger Jr.   On the multiplayer front Dark Resurrection gets the job done without being overly fussy and players can only take part in the traditional one-on-one versus mode. Although the focus on the PSP game may have been taken away from the multiplayer, in favour of a deeper single-player game, it would have been nice to see Namco Bandai shifting that focus back in this PS3 version and the inclusion of some sort of tournament mode would have been greatly appreciated. An online versus mode would've really rocked, but we guess that's something to look forward to in Tekken 6.  Although there are some definite shortcomings in Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection, like the lack of a tutorial and decent multiplayer options, its almost impossible to grumble when the game costs 6.99. For a title thats now almost two years old it still has some graphical flourishes and plays extremely well. Even with just a couple of single-player modes, the addition of 34 characters - each with a wealth of different special moves and combos to master - means theres still a lot of depth to be discovered and youll be playing this Euro launch title long after March 23.", "date": "Mar 19, 2007"}
