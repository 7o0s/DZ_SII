What started as a show about four foul-mouthed kids has morphed into 22-minutes of cutting satire that rarely misses the mark. (And even when it doesn't connect, the splatter effect is still pretty amusing.) But the show has never translated will into the realm of video games. Remember Acclaim? Their botch jobs, from Chef's Luv Shack to South Park Rally, are legendary examples of why most gamers are completely suspect of licensed games.   RealNetworks and developer Mr. Goodliving return to the minefield for South Park 10: The Game, an action-puzzler based on events from the first ten seasons of the show. One episode from each season serves as the inspiration for a trio of stages (plus bonus stages unlocked by collecting Cheesy Poofs). Cartman rounds up hippies before the music festival consumes the town. The misunderstood Scuzzlebutt rescues citizens. Lemmywinks escapes from Mr. Slave's, uh, insides. These moments were certainly funny in the television show and do a great job following the evolution of the series, but they are unfortunately not entertaining enough backdrops to mask bland game mechanics.   The second stage, based of the ~Cow Days~ episode, nails down the problems with South Park 10 -- float-y controls make uninteresting puzzle mechanics often frustrating and the boring collection quests serve to artificially extend the life of the game. As a cow, you must navigate over a series of moving platforms and spiked-filled chasms to rescue other cows trapped behind locked doors. You can pick up hay bales with ~5~ (since this is South Park, we'll throw the logistics of this aside for now) to access high ledges. While hopping across the mountainside, avoiding ranchers that walk in very set patterns is actually the lesser threat. Jumping with 1, 2, and 3 is frustratingly inaccurate. It's too easy to bonk into a needed hay bale and knock it off the ledge. Worse is the mechanic of dropping a carried item. Pressing 5 to release an item tosses it into the air and slightly off to the side. A careless release can send the needed item cascading off-screen.   The levels are quite small so you can get through them quickly; this is not bad mobile design by any stretch. You could breeze through South Park 10 in around an hour if you just sat there and played it. To give the game a little longevity, the developers sprinkled a set number of Cheesy Poofs in each level. If you find all of them, you unlock a bonus level. You also earn special goodies for completing the game. If you beat all of the bonus levels, for example, you earn a speed-run mode.   The game certainly recreates the crude animation of South Park. Characters have just a handful of movement frames. Backdrops look like construction paper cut-outs. But simplistic should not be confused with boring. The South Park show has plenty of style, and in emulating it, so does the game.   But while it is relatively easy to capture the show's style, porting its humor over to a video game is much tougher. By just relying on the situations -- Cartman seeking out hippies -- the edge of the humor is missing. The point of the episode was to poke fun of how many people in the so-called anti-establishment crowd are against business just because, well, that's just what they are supposed to be against. That's missing here and thusly, we're left with a basic action-puzzler that has Cartman in a house full of hippies. That may invoke a smile for a second, but missing the same jump three times in a row will wipe that away in no time.  South Park 10 certainly has a good idea -- cull moments from popular episodes -- but the game mechanics just aren't very interesting. The platforming elements are very basic and marred by slippery controls. The puzzle elements are workable, but not terribly exciting. I do like that they have some extra content you can unlock, but the whole business of collecting is creaky. And while I think South Park 10 definitely gets the look of the show right, the humor doesn't make the leap and that leaves you with a very basic action-puzzler that just happens to star Cartman, Butters, and the rest of the South Park cast.", "date": "Mar 31, 2007"}
