Though it certainly deserved some credit for trying to push the Blue Bomber into the modern age, the development team's heart just didn't seem to be in it. So while it's true that the game was heavy on the 3D and had its own fair share of cel-shaded polygonal action, the spotty camera work and clunky control didn't seem to be worth it. Luckily Capcom learned from its mistakes and has gone back to the drawing board with Mega Man X8 -- an obviously improved and thoroughly more playable mix of 2D and 3D that series fans should really enjoy. Of course there are still a few snags that keep it from being on the same level as the classic Super NES and early PSOne versions, but even so, this effort makes enough improvements to almost erase the bad memory that is X7.   That said, the most important change this year is the improvement to the camera system. In X7, the poorly-positioned camera and bizarre enemy placement would often leave your characters vulnerable for attack from foes you couldn't even see. In Mega Man X8 that problem is no longer an issue as the forward movement and 3/4 perspectives have been removed in favor of old-school 2D side-scrolling. In keeping with the 3D ideal from the last game, however, there are a still a couple of areas that throw in a few pseudo-3D Viewtiful Joe-like pathways. Thankfully the transition from one plane to another is pretty seamless and isn't the bothersome chore that switches in X7 were. It's an easy and totally acceptable gameplay method and one that should have been used in 2003 to begin with.   Click For More Images This new tweak to the design means that the stages in X8 are a lot more fun too, and in several respects, can be rather intelligent. In the Underground Logistics Bases known as Pitch Black, for example, there are a slew of spotlights scattered throughout the level to help illuminate your pathway. Successfully navigating them allows you to continue unscathed while running into one unleashes a horde of angered Reploids hell-bent on taking you out. Admittedly this concept isn't exactly new in the realm of videogames world (we've seen it dozens of times), but the implantation of the spotlights -- the way in which you have to avoid them and find your way through the stage -- is put together in a way that encourages constant thinking and constant physical reaction. There's a lot of variety and strategy to it and there are plenty more examples of how players can combine their reflexes and judgment skills where that came from.   My favorite stage, and by far one of the most interesting in the history of the Mega Man X series, would have to be the Rotating Labyrinth of Prime Rose. Made up of several different gravity-based puzzles, the level requires players to use their smarts in a constantly changing gravity field that's always altering the level's layout. By the time I reached the end I was sorry it was over and for the first time in awhile felt somewhat attached to a Mega Man game. Other stages of note, like Burn Rooster's eternally deep waste facility or Earthrock Trilobyte's cool meteor crash site offer up some nice diversions as well, and the challenge in all the stages are immensely difficult compared to just about everything else this season.   Unfortunately when Mega Man X8 gets away from the mechanics that have made the series what it is (spaceship shooting, vehicle shooting) the game definitely loses some steam. Avalanche Yeti and Gigabolt Man-O-War's stages are more annoying than they are entertaining. It may be a change of pace from the typical Mega Man setup sure, but why even bother when it controls sluggishly, is intentionally cheap, and offers little variety. If only those stages had remained traditional like the rest of the game...   Then again, Mega Man X8's adherence to traditionalism is a bit of a double-edged sword. Since X8 sticks so closely to the same gameplay mechanics that it originally had in the 1990s, it has a dated feeling to it that makes it appear somewhat limited compared to other games in the genre. As an example, if you stick this and Devil May Cry 3 in front of me it's easy to pick the winner: it's Devil May Cry 3 every time. The reason for that decision is because of DMC's depth, which is an area that Mega Man is lacking in quite a bit. To its credit, the game does a good job of masking its replayablity problems with an RPG-like upgrade feature that resembles last year's version, and a few of the upgrades aren't even available unless you play on the hardest difficulty setting. Obviously the incentive to play on all difficulty stages is here, but the problem is that if you grab most of your items on your first time through, the second trip can get pretty tedious when you have to repeat it.    To add a little more variety the same three characters from the last game are back this time too -- with X, Axl, and Zero all offering unique styles of gameplay with a couple of changes worth noting (Axl can no longer run and shoot at the same time, for instance). Technically there's a fourth character as well (if you find the Neutral Armor for X, which isn't that hard to do) but for most of the game you'll only need to use X and Axl. The reason for this is because, as cool and powerful as Zero may be to use, he's almost like a self-handicap -- since most of the bosses and enemies are best dealt with from a distance. Regardless of who you use, though, the experience can still be pretty fun thanks to the variety of weapons and nicely-design levels. All told, it will probably last you anywhere from six to eight hours depending on your skill level, use of the new team attacks, and desire to uncover multiple endings.If you loved Mega Man X7 and thought it was one of the best action games of last year then Mega Man X8 will probably grant you eternal life. But since it's a safe bet that there weren't too many X7 fans to begin with, then a more realistic reaction is that X8 is definitely worth a weekend or two. At the very least it's a substantial improvement over 2003's version and has some truly awesome stages in the short amount of time it lasts. But as fun and clever as some of these stages and enemies may be, they're still pretty limited in scope and replayablity because of their aging design. If you're like me and don't mind that kind of old-school gameplay, though, then Mega Man X8 is definitely worth a quick look.", "date": "Dec 3, 2004"}
