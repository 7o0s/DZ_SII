Wipeout, being a rather violent crash, and white, as in snow, are combined to instill a sense of eXtremity in the player. The game's design process took a similar route by creating an amalgamation of a game through combining various ideas. While the game started out as attempting to be a straightforward and realistic racer, changes were made along the way to try and lean it towards an extreme sports game.   Vicarious Visions has managed to pull off quite a few feats of amazement in the past. Their GameBoy Advance version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 was exceptional in that it captured the feel of the Playstation 2 version better than anyone could have hoped. Their port of the fourth game in the series was no slouch, either. And now, beyond all comprehension, it seems that Vicarious Visions has managed to imbed a fun-sucking vortex directly into a CD.   That's not to say that the game is all that bad, it's just that there isn't much fun to be had with it. With the various shifts in design goals throughout the game's development cycle, the game ends up being a little bit of many things, but the end result isn't one that seems focused in any manner.   Gameplay  The game controls well enough, though the controls are probably too tight and trick performance is lacking enough that driving your sled around isn't actually any fun. The control scheme is standard fair for this sort of game; X accelerates, Square brakes, Circle is for using Nitro and the L1 and R1 buttons perform stunts. Each sled's handling is fairly tight, and the game plays heavily like an arcade racer rather than having any minutia of a simulation feeling. This is fine to a point, but the sense of riding on snow is almost entirely lost since any bit of subtlety in your sled's handling is non-existent.   Your sled will almost never slide out from under you, which should happen since you're on snow, which is rumored to be a little slippery. The sleds can turn in a fairly tight radius without really losing any speed, so there's hardly any planning or practice needed to take any of the game's turns. In fact, it's so easy to control your sled that the game is completely playable up until the exact moment that you fall asleep from boredom. Even with my eyes mostly shut and sleep creeping in quickly, I was able to control my vehicle perfectly fine until the moment everything went black.  It's a ring of fire.  The only part of driving your sled that really needs any semblance of practice is landing. In order to keep up your speed, you'll need to level the sled out properly for its landing and attempt to land on its treads rather than its skis. This mostly works fine, but the sleds don't seem to act consistently while airborne. Sometimes you'll be able to take a huge jump and your sled will stay level the entire time without your assistance. On some occasions, though, part way through the air your sled will suddenly become front-heavy and start nose-diving. It's not really hard to correct this, but it's an odd thing and it doesn't seem to make much sense.   Performing stunts is hardly fun or even really necessary. One factor is that there are only so many things you can do on a sled. Variety is not one of the game's strong points. Another problem is that most of the stunts are slow enough that you're not able to hold any of them for any reasonable period of time. In fact, you'll have a hard time even completing most of the stunts on many of the small and medium hills, which makes a fairly large portion of each track un-trickable. The money you earn from simply winning races is enough to purchase new sleds, and the only reason you'll ever really need to trick is to complete goals that require a certain score.    Upgrades provide very little in the way of actually ~upgrading~ anything. Your current sled might be able to top out at around 72mph while its speed stat meter is halfway full. Spending a ton of cash to max out your ride's speed will only end in miserable disappointment, as you might be able to hit 75mph now on a good day. That 5% increase won't really make you feel like the last hour you spent re-racing the same tracks over and over to earn money was really worth it. The stat meters are also relative only to their respective vehicle. For instance, your current sled's stats may look like they're at the same level as one of the sleds for the next circuit, but the next circuit of sleds actually outperform the slower models by a decent margin, regardless of what their stats may show.   Whiteout's courses aren't as XTREME as they should be, or as challenging, either. As mentioned before, the controls are overly tight to the point where the courses are exceedingly easy to maneuver. Since monkeys have two thumbs, I'd imagine even they would have any easy time racing through any of the tracks. The only challenge in beating any of the lap time goals is in making sure you use Nitro in the right places and taking advantage of shortcuts on the track.   The course design is generally decent I suppose, but it's really the fault of the controls and lackluster stunts that make them seem boring. There aren't any turns that'll have you reaching for the brakes as your turning radius is so tight, and the larger jumps aren't actually big enough to let you pull off a nice series of stunts since they're so slow to perform.   There are shortcuts throughout the courses that provide an alternate way to race each track, but they have their own set of problems. First off, once you find them they become a major advantage to your lap time. The computer will ignore some of the shortcuts most of the time, so it becomes easy to get way ahead of them without any trouble. The second problem is that although a few can be tricky to spot at first, they're simple to get to once you know where they are. The shortcuts also aren't any harder to race through, so there isn't any reason not to use them. Had the shortcuts been designed so that they were difficult to race through and could possibly cause your lap times to be worse if you didn't take them properly, this simply isn't the case.   Graphics  The game isn't overly flashy for the most part, so it looks a bit more subdued than you'd expect for a game like this, though it does have its moments of flash and pizzazz. For instance, using a Nitro Boost will cause the screen to become blurred and a little warped, making it a bit harder to control where you're going. It's a fairly neat effect, and the fact that it makes it a tad more difficult to control your sled adds at least a small bit of challenge.  The Nitro effect is quite neat.  Some races that you'll enter have rings of fire that you can jump through, and the fire on these hoops looks pretty good. There are also some destructible objects here and there that'll nab you a few points if you break them. One of the better and more realistic effects of the game is the snowstorm that you'll race through on a few tracks. There's enough snow flying about that the screen is almost whitened and it looks great. Aside from these small bits, the game has more of a realistic look to it, though it doesn't quite seem to fit its overall style.    As much as the game's more realistic look clashes a tad with its attempted gameplay style, Whiteout does look generally nice overall. The snow actually looks like snow rather than boring white hills, as there are nice bits of subtle nuances that give it a cold and textural look. The hills are nicely rounded off without looking like perfectly shaped mounds of fake snow.   There isn't too much in the way of animation, though everything there works well. If you've seen someone on a personal vehicle of any sort perform a Can Can once, you've seen it a thousand times. There's a neat little thing where your rider will get off their seat and lean to the side to take tight turns, but that's about the only thing new here.   Sound  There isn't much to speak of as far as sound effects go. The constant whine of the sleds sounds fine and fills out most of the effects department. Crashing effects and crowd cheers work well enough, but again, you've heard all of this before.   The most overriding thing as far as sound goes is the commentary. This is somewhat of a mixed bag, and most people will find that the guys will get on their nerves after a short while. A few of the offbeat and out of place comments that they'll make are somewhat funny the first time or two around, like ~Have you seen my pants?~ and things of that nature. After a while, though, you'll likely grow tired of hearing about the guy's lack of clothing and just shake your head at such comments.  Whiteout is a game that seems to have had some potential, but it just has too many bland spices and herbs in the recipe to taste like anything worth serving. The controls are nicely responsive, but they're too tight and not subtle enough to make the racing aspect any fun. The trick system has been done before, and while it normally works fine, it's just too slow here to really be any fun.The game does have a solid graphics engine, though. The course design is also rather decent, except that the controls really hinder them from providing a challenge or much fun. There really isn't a whole lot that's actually bad about Whiteout, but there's just nothing that's really good about it either. So close, and yet so far.", "date": "Dec 16, 2002"}
