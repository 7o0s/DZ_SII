Two out of three of these things have never existed in a Blitz game before. Two of these things haven't even gotten within spitting distance of a Blitz game. Blitz has always been about breaking rules, not conforming to them. But the desire to give gamers what they want, coupled with the desire to maintain a franchise that appeals to consumers year in and year out has moved Midway Sports to draw influence from both sides of the coin.   Witness NFL Blitz Pro, the second game in Midway Sports' Pro series. Part arcade, part sim, this game walks a tenuous line between realism and theatrics. Players have been added, rules have been altered, and the experience has been shifted to better represent the real game of football.   So how did this little Frankenstein's monster turn out? It succeeded in its aim, in that it is a total blend of sim and arcade. It's still a wide-open, fun and fierce, but now it contains a more realistic tint. First and ten makes a difference. Eleven players on the field makes a big difference. Improved defensive AI and an enhanced running game might make you feel like you're playing a different football game entirelya regular football game. Gasp!   But never fear there's still plenty of post-play antics, big hits, and a complete disrespect for anything resembling a pass interference penalty. There's also a ton of unlockables, including some intense and fun gameplay modes. Blitz is back there's just more to love.   Gameplay  That said, Blitz Pro has a bit of an identity crisis. The football itself competes with or surpasses some of the titles on the market. However, just when you think you're playing a game with all of the bells and whistles of a full-on sim, you'll reach for a feature or tweak that just isn't there. Let me explain.   The AI, which in past years has either been almost non-existent or catch-up driven, has been improved. You'll no longer be able to pass into a crowded secondary, or run untouched on the edges. Defensive AI especially has gotten a boost, and the game is better for it. Much of this is due to the added players on the field, but much of it is due to a shift in focus. The defense has to play better in order to make first-and-ten work, and they rise to the challenge admirably.    The revamped running game is a nice addition, too. Stringing together a sweet string of jukes, spins and jump-backs, you can produce some great-looking runs, indeed. The passing game is a little headier in games past, as well, since you can't just fling the ball anywhere and expect to complete a pass. You'll have to make reads, and go to the open guy, or you won't complete it.   The playbooks have been expanded as well, and real football formations are implemented here. In addition to the standard packages, each team has its own set of specific plays which open even more offensive possibilities. Still, there are no ~Da Bomb~ plays, which were almost instant touchdown-scorers in years past, and that's a good thing.     All of this near-simulation style football leads to problems, however. It makes me want more. There are no hot routes, and the audible system is limited to four plays, which you are unable to change. You get what you get, and that's it. Line and linebacker shifts would be nice, too. Some of these problems are solved by the Impact Player feature, which allows you to change the actions of one guy, but more global changes would have been nice.   Although all of the menus are crisp and easy to navigate, it would have been nice to see more options overall. Hitz did a good job of giving you countless possibilities to allows you to tweak the game however you'd like. But nothing like that exists inBlitz. It would be nice to adjust game speed, difficulty level, game rules and more. There's also nowhere to see a quick rundown of the controls, except for random load screens, and some of the controls are kind of hidden. For instance, it took me a long time to realize that I could angle a kick, in addition to adjusting its accuracy.   Another thing that is enervating is CPU teams' decision-making. While a lot of care has been put into making the defensive AI better, the coaching AI is as boneheaded as ever. In an exhibition game, the CPU scored to pull the score even at 9-9. Instead of kicking the extra point to go ahead, they decided to go for two, and ended up missing it. The same thing occurred in the very next game, where the CPU scored first. It's not obvious whether or not all of the two point tries are in keeping with the wide-open aesthetic of gameplay, but it doesn't make sense.     Franchise Mode has been added to make the game a more single player friendly. It's a pretty bare-bones mode, all things considered. While it allows you to sign free agents, trade players, and create your own athletes, most of the menus simply contain a player name and a rating, rather than extensive scouting and player bios that exist in other football games. One cool feature, however, is the ability to improve your players over time. By earning money while playing the game, you'll be able to add to your players' stats, and give yourself an edge moving forward.   For all of the concerns we've aired, the game remains at its core very fun. The normal run of play seems to be edging closer to sim-style football, but the second one player hits another, you know you're playing Blitz. Then there's the little matter of pass interference, or lack thereof. There's no more liberating (or crushing, if it's happening to you) feeling than plowing through a receiver right as he's going to catch the ball.   Old school Blitz fans might find the most fun at the Blitz Shop, which allows you to use points that you earn in the regular game to unlock new modes of play, fantasy teams and extra stadiums. The extra game modes are where it's at. Games like Butterfingaz, where every hit jars the ball loose and play doesn't stop until someone scores, add a lot of replay value. The fact that you have to earn money to unlock them will appeal to the secret-savvy out there.   Graphics  The graphics in Blitz Pro are a mixed bag. The character models look just about like they always have, although face models have improved slightly. The fields and stadiums look pretty good, especially on the pre-game fly-ins.    Animations are what we've come to expect--over the top, and at times humorous. It's good to see that the flattening tackles and forearm shivers have been preserved. They help to keep the game's identity. The taunting animations and touchdown celebrations are nice, too.     There are too many pauses in play, however. I don't know whether this is to mask load times or not, but sometimes, the time spent between plays can be annoying. Sure, it gives you time to knock your opponent over, WWE style, but this gets old, especially in the single player experience.   Sound  Grunts and groans, bashes and biffs once again define the majority of the sound effects. The sound will appeal to old school Blitz lovers, with a couple exceptions. First off, there's not a whole lot of trash talk to be found here. As a longtime Blitz arcade fan, that's something that I truly miss. There are also no over-the-top Tim Kitzrow vocals, which have become the signature of Midway sports titles, and especially Blitz, over the years.    Instead, Midway decided to go with a formula they've been employing since the first Slugfest--put a crazy color commentator (in this case the fictional Gator Jones)  with a straight play-by-play man and listen to the verbal fireworks that result. Slugfest's commentary was one of the funnier tracks we'd heard, and this game carries on that tradition. Although some of the jokes fall flat, many of them (especially the completely random ones) actually caused me to laugh out loud. In fact, the humorous banter is the only thing that makes the rather lengthy pre-game load times okay.This game is an 8.0, but it's a hard-earned 8.0. There are some hurdles to overcome and a mindset to shake before the game opens up to you. Certain fans might feel like they're in no-man's land when it comes to this game, so it's definitely one to rent if you're on the fence. Once you get past the identity crisis, Blitz Pro is fun. The play dynamic is still fierce, there are tons of extra modes and fantasy teams to unlock. It's still a great two-player game, and the slightly better single player experience should make most fans of the series happy.", "date": "Feb 6, 2004"}
