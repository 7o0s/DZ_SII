Now six months later the core game has undergone an even more comprehensive redesign and been reborn as Star Wars Galaxies: New Game Experience. Reasoning that they needed to make the game feel ~more like Star Wars~ the developers have offered up a more straightforward character system, a twitch-oriented combat system and an entirely new player experience. While IGN doesn't re-review MMOs based on the cumulative effect of evolutionary changes, the profound differences in the New Game Experience have prompted us to evaluate the current state of the game.   The new game promises ~improved character and profession development.~ When they say ~improved~ they really mean ~simplified.~ There's a growing assumption across the industry that complex game mechanics or a multiplicity of options are somehow unrewarding. Believe it or not, some gamers actually crave complexity. Sadly, we're being squeezed out as companies seek to maximize player numbers and profits at the expense of depth and detail.  Where there were dozens of professions in the previous version of the game, the new experience folds them (and not always neatly -- sorry, creature handlers) into nine iconic professions, each of which is associated with a character from the films. While the new professions are tied closely to the more memorable characters from the films, the loss of the more specialized professions and the ability to mix and match skills to create hybrid characters makes the new characters feel a bit too generic.  It makes sense to offer players the chance to assume the role of familiar types from the films but having a universe where there are hundreds of Luke Skywalkers and Han Solos is pretty much the antithesis of roleplaying. Add in the preset ability advancement and there's even less to separate you from the other players in the game. Excluding racial or equipment bonuses, all similar character types of a similar level are going to have the same abilities. While it makes advancement idiot-proof, it also keeps you from feeling like you have any say in how your character grows.  To help them reevaluate their purpose in the new game, veteran players were allowed to reinvent their characters, translating experience in one of the original professions to one of the new professions. It's relatively simple to fit some of the profession types into the new system, but finding just the right fit for some of the elite professions is a little more difficult. On logging in for the first time, I wasn't sure if my master carbineer fit better as a spy, commando or bounty hunter. While each of those professions was appealing, none of them exactly fit my conception of the character I had been playing for two years.   Unfortunately, players can now choose Jedi as a starting profession. While this is the ultimate in wish fulfillment for most Star Wars fans, the scarcity of Jedi is so fundamental to the time period represented in the game that it seems to completely undercut the developers' claims that their main goal is ~to make the game more like Star Wars.~ With Jedi flashing their sabers nearly everywhere you turn, the mystique and magic of the profession are completely gone. Perhaps worst of all, opening up the Jedi profession for all players is a huge ~screw you~ to the players who bothered to put forth the time and effort required to unlock the secret of playing Jedis under the old system.      Since entertainers and shipwrights can trade in their clarinets and slide rules for lightsabers, you're going to find that some of the more prosaic professions are falling by the wayside. The server I'm on right now has virtually no shipwrights to speak of, rendering the pilot profession almost as esoteric and inaccessible as the Jedi path used to be. While we're on the subject of pilots, the NGE includes all the Jump to Lightspeed content. It's a bit of a pain for players who actually bothered to buy that expansion when it first came out. A substantial veteran reward would definitely have eased some tempers here.  Happily, the new player experience is full of excitement and iconic Star Wars moments. Characters start out on an Imperial facility just prior to being rescued by Han Solo and Chewbacca. A host of other notables turn in appearances here. C3PO provides a little tutorial advice before you're rescued, and, once you make your way to Ord Mantell, you'll be able to go to a cantina for the pleasure of standing next to Boba Fett and watching him be gruff.   The Ord Mantell starting area is a nice way to let players get their feet wet, exploring all the different types of quests that are likely to come their way once they reach the wider world beyond. There are plenty of fetch missions, some hunting missions, a bit of space content and even a large dungeon to explore all within the first hour of playing. That it's set in Ord Mantell is a nice treat for fans of the franchise beyond the films. The small references and connections made to the movies adds greatly to a hardcore Star Wars fan's enjoyment of this newbie area.  This new player tutorial might create a small continuity problem for players who want to stick with the Empire (as in: why would they want to escape?) but once you leave the starting area, you're free to align yourself with whatever faction you choose.   Once you reach the rest of the galaxy you'll have been prepared to handle a wide variety of tasks. Still, there's a bit more orientation to be found here as NPCs lead you to trainers, key facilities and other areas of interest. The basic combat and errand quests don't seem to have changed much so you're likely to be doing much the same things as you were before the NGE launched. There is plenty of content here to fill out your early levels. Whether or not it holds up in the long term remains to be seen but the two most recent expansions have definitely enlarged the opportunities for high level adventuring.  Earlier this year, the combat upgrade did away with some of the more complicated aspects of Galaxies' combat system. Though it meant that your choices in combat were ultimately less interesting, the more straightforward approach definitely gave players greater opportunities to enjoy watching the combats play out. Though I personally appreciated the more direct combat style, there were plenty of players who felt about it the way I feel about the NGE's new character system.  Whatever your thoughts about the implementation of a single damage type in the CU, you'll have to admit that the combat system used in the NGE is much more interactive and exciting than before. Players will now actually have to aim their weapons at their targets. The left mouse button launches a basic attack and the right mouse button activates whatever special ability you have queued up. It might turn off gamers who aren't fans of twitch action but the enemies here aren't quite as nimble as those in F.E.A.R. so you should be able to keep up.  That's assuming that you're not experiencing lag. MMOs tend to shy away from twitch-oriented game mechanics purely for that reason. Even on a cable connection, I still had to contend with occasional warping. You have a bit more room to recover as a ranged attacker but it's not that bad, even for melee fighters, given that the enemies are either running right at you or right away from you.  Not surprisingly, the graphics and sound of the New Game Edition haven't been altered. The game has scaled quite nicely with advances in 3D technology and Galaxies is still one of the better looking MMOs on the market, even two years after its initial release. In terms of audio, the game makes excellent use of the sounds from the films. Hearing the effects and music cues from the films really lends to the authenticity and enjoyment of the game.      As with any MMO, there are still plenty of bugs to be found and squashed. Quests lead to NPCs who refuse to talk business with you. Animations are missing for some key encounters. Some low-level enemies seem completely unfazed by your attacks. Thankfully, the problems we've encountered have been inconvenient rather than game-killing. They're sure to be addressed in the coming months but, for right now, players should be prepared for some predictable launch pains.  Finally, in evaluating the changes made to this game, we might linger for a moment on the justification for the changes and the way that they've been implemented. While Sony Online and LucasArts keep offering the justification that the previous version of the game just didn't feel like Star Wars, it's not too cynical to imagine that the changes have been made to increase subscriber numbers. While that's a fine goal, the reinvention minimizes the time and energy current subscribers have poured into the game.   Still, there may be more at work than the publisher's hopes of achieving World of Warcraft's million subscriber mark. The changes definitely make the game a better fit for the console market. The console audience isn't likely to be satisfied spending $15 a month to cook meals or design huts. It's speculation of course, but Galaxies was announced for the console market over three years ago and could merely be waiting in the wings.  Whatever the case, the changes have been both praised and condemned by current players. Whether or not it ultimately has a positive or negative effect on subscriber numbers remains to be seen.The changes to combat definitely make Star Wars Galaxies a more exciting experience overall. Sure, it suffers from a few unavoidable limitations due to the MMO format, but the basic experience is definitely more rewarding that the click and watch affair of most MMOs. The new simplified class system is a big step backwards as far as I'm concerned. If all you want is to be Boba Fett or Princess Leia, you'll have less of a problem with this, but you'll still feel like your character's identity and abilities is being determined by the designers, not by you.Good or bad, this second revamp for Galaxies gives us little confidence in the future stability of the design. The scope of the recent changes prompts us to question how long it will be before the team decides to reinvent the game again, purely on the justification that it still ~doesn't feel like Star Wars.~ Given that the MMO format requires a substantial investment of time and money, the reliability of the game is a crucial factor in determining whether or not that investment will pay off.", "date": "Dec 13, 2005"}
