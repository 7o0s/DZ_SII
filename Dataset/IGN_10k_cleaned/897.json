The full story behind my switch from microbiology to the story of mankind (early Renaissance Europe, specifically) is quite ridiculous and certainly not worth the telling, but the short version is that I was good at it, and more than that I enjoyed it.  Whoever came up with the one about truth being stranger than fiction hit the nail on the head and then some -- if you don't believe me, I have a whopper about the sewers in 17th-century London that I think you'd get a kick out of.  I bring up the subject of history because the game at hand, Romance of the Three Kingdoms VI, gives me an excuse to teach two history lessons: one about the history that inspired the game, and another about the place it holds in the short, but eventful, history of gaming proper. The first one is more interesting, but those of you who think strategy games began with Warcraft need to listen harder to the second one.  You also need to find yourself a copy of Herzog Zwei, but that's getting a little off the track.  Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Sangokushi in Japan) is Koei's flagship series, six installments of historical strategy-simulation whose initial iteration was around before I first turned on an NES.  The games are based on a novel that bears the same name, a chronicle written in the fourteenth century concerning the wars of the Later Han Dynasty, the period from the late second century through to the middle of the third when China was filled with warfare and rebellion.  Though it runs to more than three thousand pages in its unabridged form, it's a highly recommended read (and could be used to brain an intruder in a pinch); if you don't have the time, you should at least check out the six-page condensed version in Larry Gonick's Cartoon History of the Universe, Volume 2.  It has the same epic feel as King Arthur or the Homeric legends, and if you want to brush up on your Confucian sagery, there's no better study aid.  As I said, this series has been around for some time, and at its core, it hasn't changed much.  There have been plenty of refinements to its gameplay and presentation, but nothing particularly drastic.  Thus, given the massive evolution in the nature of strategy games over the last few years (and in a broader sense, the emaciation of the human attention span), someone who buys RTKVI expecting an experience even vaguely resembling Age of Empires, Starcraft, Command and Conquer, et cetera, is due for an unpleasant surprise.  This is old-style strategy, Ancient Art of War kind of strategy, into which the concept of real-time action does not even contemplate intruding.  Battles occur on an isometric 2D grid, and everything follows a turn-based progression.  Furthermore, it is epic strategy, in the Civilization mode - those expecting short, fast, skirmishes will be confronted by a campaign that demands hours upon hours to complete.  Now that I've built it up into a sort of Goliath of hard-core strategy gaming, I should go on to make clear that even if it is such, it's still an eminently well-designed one.    Before you head out on that campaign, you can try a set of ~short scenarios,~ snippets of various time periods that place you in a particular role with a few tasks to accomplish.  They do a good job of introducing specific game elements and important techniques -- once you've finished a few of them, you won't be quite so adrift.  Then you can take on the full scenario mode, where the heart of the game lies.  You can pick one of nine time periods from the general Three Kingdoms era (the late second century through to the middle of the third), and control one of several rulers therein, meaning that there are dozens of different conquest scenarios to be played out.  Success in the full scenario mode demands a great deal of patience, a willingness to master all the aspects of the game system and take things slowly as far as total world domination is concerned.  Unless you've selected one of the later time periods, where the wars have boiled down to the eponymous three kingdoms, you'll start out with a very small economic and military power base: a few cities, a handful of generals, and a skeleton army, just enough to defend your borders.  Building up from there takes a while, and defeat is a very frequent punishment for rulers who overextend themselves.  Build your army too quickly, and you'll run out of cash and food stores; the time scale moves from month to month, but your resources only increase twice a year or so with the semiannual tax collection.  If you're used to the swift harvests of real-time games, you may find your soldiers starving in the field, or you'll expend all your forces and have no resources to draft replacements.  If you manage to create a stable resource base, you may still face a shortage at the management level.  Good generals are hard to come by, and cities and armies aren't much good with nobody to govern and lead them.  Undermanned frontier towns will be easy pickings for other warlords or barbarian invasions.  Finally, even if you do forge a well-run empire, at that point in the game you'll be sharing China with at least another equally solid nation.  The long and the short of it is that you're not going to win this one the first time out.  In fact, you're liable to get regularly waxed, especially in those cutthroat early scenarios.  While you're dying, though, you're learning as well - lessons like leaving a rear guard when your main force charges, so the enemy doesn't steal your food supplies with an end run (boy, that's embarrassing), and the inestimable value of not going to war when you don't have to.  After a little trial and error, the flow of gradual logistic development and measured military action becomes easier to follow.  Once you've scratched enough of the surface, you can dig deeper into the game's array of extra options.  Although it's easy to settle into a routine of using only a few commands and actions, there's a heck of a lot of different things you can do.  The simplest way to conquer your neighbors is to hurl massive units of cavalry at them (anyway, it's my favorite), but through the appropriate use of unusually skilled officers, you can undermine their reputations or incite revolts in their populace.  You can also make use of nearby rulers before you grind them into the dust, forming allegiances to create non-aggression pacts or organize joint campaigns.  In battle, the time-honored frontal assault is what you'll probably use the most, but there are other ways to insure victory: traps, subterfuge, assassination, treachery, and even one-on-one duels.    The battle system is a nice blend of turn-based control and a dash of RTS speed.  Combat is measured in days, after every four of which you can issue new commands to your troops.  In between, they carry out your orders automatically, and if you arrange the automatic behavior settings right, they're usually pretty smart.  The relative infrequency of breaks in the battle means you do have to anticipate the enemy's actions (at least at the beginning of the battle), but once you learn how to read the battlefield, that's not so hard.I am, in short, very pleased by the gameplay that RTKVI presents.  It's deep, complex, and packed with replay value - like I say, you could start dozens of different games and encounter a different scenario each time.  When I pass that judgment, however, note that I'm speaking in the first person for a change.  This is a type of game that the younger generation definitely needs to try out, especially considering that turn-based strategy is probably not long for this world.  However, evangelist that I may be, at least in my more frothing moments, the fact must be faced that a great many players will not be particularly interested in it, no matter what I say.  It doesn't help that this is not exactly a looker of a game.  RTKVI's graphical presentation would be best described as utilitarian, having changed hardly at all in comparison to its eight-bit great-grandparents.  It makes use of the PlayStation's superior color palette, resulting in smooth backgrounds and character portraits, but the few moving sprites are still, for lack of a better term, pretty dinky.  Add that to the dense gameplay system, relatively slow battles, and general lack of obvious action, and you have a package that easily lands in the shadow of much flashier competition.But what a shame that would be, for a game with this much depth and historical flavor to be passed by.  After a little settling in and a few ignominious defeats, the progress of commerce, war, and intrigue becomes enveloping, thanks especially to the frequent dialogue and cinematic interludes, which are all surprisingly well composed and translated.  If, as I suspect, this is the last Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and perhaps one of the last classic strategy games on a home console, it's certainly not a bad note upon which to end that little bit of history.", "date": "Apr 27, 2000"}
