It doesn't have the high impact thrills of football, nor does it feature the competitive back-and-forth mechanics of basketball. It is a one-man show, a game defined by skill, strategy and patience, and as such it's also a sporting genre that has always made the transition to videogames very well. Over the years there have been countless golf titles -- some flawed, some good and some great, but few that could be called the true Madden of golf with any validity. Leave it to publisher Electronic Arts, though, to change that.  Enter Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 for GameCube. The title, developed internally at EA, wraps real and fantasy courses and pro golfers, a wide selection of mini-games and challenges, plus more, around what has to be the most solid gameplay mechanics and 3D engine yet seen in a console golf game. The franchise still isn't quite perfect -- there are a couple of omissions and oversights that we'd have preferred were addressed -- but it's easily and without doubt the best golf videogame experience in years, and one deserving to be thought of in the same light that Madden is to football.

In truth, the title mixes in particles of both and then solidifies the pieces into one big package. This double-catered appeal seems to stretch its fingers to nearly every facet of the game, from the selection of courses to the characters available, the play styles, and more. The result, a thoroughly balanced golf game, is also one that might have too many arcade elements for the aspiring connoisseur of the sport, and perhaps too many simulation elements for those who think of Mario when they think of golf. For the record, we think it all comes together triumphantly minus a few hiccups that are pinkish rare.  Tiger Woods comes complete with 12 different courses, several of them -- Pebble Beach Golf Links, Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass, The Royal Birkdale, Princeville, Torrey Pines, Poppy Hills, Spyglass Hill, and Tournament Players Club at Scottsdale -- are based on the real deals. The selection, still impressive, lacks some of the other pro courses featured in hardcore golf titles, but EA has attempted to make up for this by including additional fantasy holes. These, of which there are three, range from The Predator, which is set to the backdrop of a South American jungle, to The Highlands, a tribute to Scotland complete with castle and clouds in the distance. With 18 holes each, gamers aren't likely to grow tired of the abundance quickly, and there are so many addictive challenges and mini-games in between that we'd need a digital scroll to list them. Fabulous work.  EA's latest update isn't the same old golf game. The title features a drastically different control scheme from most golf outings, one that is more intuitively designed and functional with the sport than any other. Gone are the meters of previous golf experiences. Gone are the taps of buttons timed to power swings. Instead, strokes are leveled exclusively by the analog stick, and with a sense of precision more polished than ever before. Players simply pull back their golfer's club with the stick and then push forward to swing; the more ~weight~ behind the stroke mixed with the timing of delivery determines the end power. It's this new setup -- with hints of arcade and simulation abilities attached -- that serves as the backbone for the play mechanics in the game. To call it a breakthrough for golf games would, in our opinion, be an understatement. It changes the whole dynamic. It's superbly implemented.  Just one of the atmospheric courses in the game  Of course, there are other control attributes that complete the configuration, all of them designed to offer gamers a deep, engaging experience without breaking from the recreation. When in the long, A button raises the camera to different views of the course, B switches stroke style (flop, full, punch, approach), R and L cycle clubs, and X makes the camera trace where the ball might land when hit Players will notice that there are no measurement grids when putting, few line of sights to holes -- no real cheats. Instead, gamers must observe; look at the environment around them, hit away from obtrusive objects, and knock balls in based, for the most part, on their own calculations. It's very simulation-like in that respect, and it works remarkably well. Also, there is a heightened sense of satisfaction gained having sunk a hole almost entirely on one's own. That's not to say that there are no hints -- the distance of each shot is still calculated by the CPU, and a marker still shows gamers the general area of where there ball may land when hit with the different clubs. But the information isn't overbearing. And that's refreshing.      The simple process of adding power to swings is nicely executed. A small, circular meter on the lower screen measures power, and it starts to fill red as players quickly tap the GameCube's Z trigger while pulling back on a shot with the analog stick. When the meter is filled, the swing is pushed forward, and the power is inserted into the shot. This simple function can add massive yardage to swings and there is enough skill involved in the process that it feels right. We love it, but we realize that simulation junkies may not; the good news is that it can be turned off.    There are basically two general areas during play when the arcade and simulation cogs of the package seem to grind against each other. The first and most offensive we think is the function of adding spin to balls. This is done as the balls are in the air by quickly tapping the Z-button and pressing the analog stick into the direction that players would like to add spin. Again, we have no qualms with the process -- it's intuitive and works excellently. But we just know that simulationists bent on a perfect recreation of golf will wonder why spin can't be put on balls more realistically -- before they are in the air. EA has at least included the option to remove the function from play, but when that's done there is no replacement -- spins are just gone, a disappointment. The other clash relates to putting. At points, the holes themselves seem slightly magnetized; they very occasionally reach out and suck balls in when they have no business being sunk. At the very least, this is an arcade intrusion and at the very most it's a glitch. Either way, it's infrequent, but there will be points when players question just how forgiving the game is willing to be.  Despite our minor issues, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 still plays like a dream. The analog control setup is something of a godsend, particularly well-felt using Nintendo's ultra-sensitive pad. Meanwhile, the modes are plentiful, varied, and the artificial intelligence a noteworthy foe. The AI matches in the game's main mode, Tiger Challenge, are riveting. We've gone through 18 holes neck-in-neck with our opponents, who are not dumbed down, but very skilled, and come away with shortened fingernails and an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. Each Tiger Match won grants gamers mega dollars to upgrade their character's statistics -- everything from power, accuracy and recovery to putting, approach, spin and, yes, even luck. Fully accomplishing one's character is no easy task, but it's an enjoyable one, and there is a clear indication of advancement in-play for these upgrades. More still, various new levels are unlocked having beat Tiger Mode matches, as are access to various gear, from clubs to gloves and more. It's an extremely complete undertaking in this regard.  Gamers can jump into Speed Golf to compete in head-to-head matches -- the first to reach the hole and sink their shot wins. There is what EA calls a Skill Zone, a series of fantasy levels filled with targets and surrounded by dangers, scenario matches and regular stroke play for up to four gamers. Each area seems a virtual rabbit hole, deep with individual offerings. Gamers can even create their own course, in a sense: 18 holes nabbed from all of the available parks in the title. However, the effort serves up no real course designer, which is an oversight we think, and likewise there is no character creator, a definite shortcoming considering that the feature rests snugly in most of EA's other sports entries.   Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 on GCN  Probably the biggest disappointment, though, is that there is no real official tour in PGA Tour, so to speak. Rather, there are a series of one-on-one matches and the ability to play against three other AI opponents. These are not bad -- but they aren't tours. It's almost as bad as Madden 2003 shipping without a franchise mode, or the ability to play to the Super Bowl.  Graphics Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 is the prettiest golf game on any home console to date. The presentation, from the animated menus with Tiger and other characters moving about in the background to the quick load times and transitions between interfaces, is exceptional. Meanwhile, EA has developed a super slick 3D engine that renders the courses in real-time. From a purely technical standpoint, the engine is miles ahead of those powering competing golf games. Not only are the environments, filled with geometry and subtle additions such as spectator crowds, seemingly larger, but they are drawn without a hitch as the framerate hardly ever stutters. There is also no pop-up.  The holes are varied with all sorts of different texture sets, creating a wide selection of colorful, unique locales to play in. The courses are large, stretching hundreds of yards into the distance. Cinematic camera fly-bys and angles shoot the action from dozens of different angles and zoom in on the characters themselves as they move through the courses. It looks absolutely fantastic. All of the models in the game are exquisitely detailed. It's amazing how lifelike Tiger Woods looks and animates. When the athlete sinks a hole in one, he jumps up in down with hands in the air -- silky smooth motion-capture -- and the celebration is doused by a series of camera sweeps and close-ups. Original animation sets are used for each other character, too, right down to the way they swing their club. EA has even utilized a complex facial animation system so that Tiger and other golfers blink, look around and show various emotions, from happiness to disappointment and anger. Power shots are complemented by a host of different cinematic presentations, from revolving cameras to blur filters and slow-motion enhancements. Again, it's all brilliantly applied.  Maps are well lit and overflowing with subtle effects, from the way trees in the background sway with the wind to how the sun reflects in the camera lens, or distorts the visibility in the immediate line of a player's sight. The golfers, meanwhile, cast real shadows, there is a wide selection of particle effects, reflective and transparent water, and more.   On the downside, some of the textures in the game fail to match the quality of the rest, there is the very occasional slow down (mostly limited to putting, strangely) and, sadly, there is no progressive scan support. These graphic shortcomings are very, very short indeed, however.    Sound What do you get when you mix a cast of colorful golf commentaries with professional quality sound effects and hip, young music? Why, the audio portion of Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003, of course. EA, as always, has done a fairly solid job with the aural experience in its game. The title puts EA Sports Trax music to good use so that such bands as Saliva, Boy Sets Fire, 12 Stones, Paul Oakenfold, Ash and Silverchair provide contributions. The tracks, as it were, are for the most part very good -- a little light rocky, but catchy enough. Rock music glued to golf is initially unsettling, but after that's hurdled it works quite well. The music strangely can only be used in one and two-player games and can also be turned off if players prefer. Then there are the sound effects, which are rich and deep, from the thick whooping of the golf swing to the bang of smacking a ball into a metal post in one of the fantasy locales, it's all well done. This is all topped off by color commentary, a selection of humorous fellows who provide very little in the way of analysis other than to announce that the player has really smacked it good this time, or that they think the ball's going in for sure. All around top. But where is the Dolby Pro Logic II support?Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 is my favorite golf game to date. It blows the doors off Mario Golf with its control mechanics and takes Links down with its amazing presentation and superbly crafted 3D engine and courses. It's a game that walks a fine line between arcade and simulation golf, and in some instances -- occasionally magnetized holes and unfortunately limited ball-spinning functions -- it crosses the line. But even when it does it's still immensely fun. It's amazingly entertaining. And, at least for me, it's something that can be picked up and played again and again without ever threatening to become tedious.There are enough real and fantasy holes to keep gamers busy for weeks, and the character building features -- that of increasing attribute statistics with money won in matches -- is intuitively implemented to the point where it really draws players to keep working at it. Beyond these, there are all sorts of mini-games, scenario modes, skill levels, and just about everything in between, including some fascinatingly original multiplayer offerings. This is a deep game. Which makes it all the more puzzling that a proper character create mode has been omitted from the experience, or that the title doesn't likewise boast a real course creator for purists. Perhaps worst of all, though, is that there isn't a true PGA Tour mode in place -- an oversight akin to leaving the Super Bowl out of Madden.It's a visual stunner, of course -- the prettiest golf game I've ever seen, by a landslide. And the audio experience is right on par (pun) with the graphics.An absolutely excellent golf game in most respects. Highly recommended.", "date": "Oct 24, 2002"}
