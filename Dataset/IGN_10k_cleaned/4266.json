{"name": "NCAA Football '99", "name_review": "NCAA Football '99", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/08/29/ncaa-football-99-2", "text": "With football becoming the most hard-nosed competitive sport developed (i.e. Sony's Gameday vs. EA's Madden series, for example) these days, logical variations of the sport are clearly needed. For some time now, Electronic Arts' NCAA Football 99 has performed in sterling fashion as a mainstay in the college arena. It's had problems in the past, and it's not pro football, but college gridiron play can be the most fun game ever, if you know what you're doing.  Despite a few problems, NCAA's gameplay is good, solid strapping stuff. A number of additions keep the old formula fresh, including a nifty Dynasty mode, pitch and pump fakes, analog passing, polygonal players, a better chance for smaller schools to make it to the big bowl, and a few other cool items, specifically the concept of 'team spirit.'  In the offensive realm, NCAA 99 brings gamers an initially awkward one-touch passing game, which, once learned, is enjoyable. It's EA's way of gathering in anyone who would want to play NFL Blitz, and letting him or her go at it. NCAA just isn't as easy as Midway's NFL Blitz, that's all. The icon throwing game is there, and the addition of the pump fake throws off the defense well.   In a case of weird defensive AI, many times as QB you complete almost impossible passes in which two or three guys are smothering your receiver -- a total oddity. Yeah it happens, but rarely in the pros, and here it occurs more often that reality should permit.   Again, on offense, the new play editor is just plain cool. Using pre-existing formations, gamers can edit and save up to three offensive and defensive plays. It's relatively easy to use, and makes the game playing far more interesting on both sides of the ball.   Once blurry and annoying to the eye, the cruddy sprites of games past have been replaced by polygons and Gouraud-shaded players, giving the game a clean, sharp feel. As with any football game, this or any college football title, doesn't feature player licenses, so the players' uniforms are generally bland, but at least reflect the teams with the right colors and mostly accurate helmets. Among other things, this improves the visuals of the running game. Players sprint around the ends or up the middle juking, sprinting, straight-arming and spinning, and there is a far greater chance that you'll get the extra yards in this title. The cleaner graphics are backed up by cleaner play as well, providing the game with an overall better feel than last year's title.   NCAA 99 also provides exclusive licenses for the Fed Ex Orange Bowl, the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, and the Nokia Sugar Bowl.   In many ways, NCAA Football 99 is a preview of the Madden 99 engine. Madden 99 is a completely different game, with a different feel and play, but many of the abilities of players are in both. The control here is much better than in previous versions; it's tighter and thus more responsive. But, compared to a few other football games out there, play is still slow. Once EA can get football games to play like Street Fighter 2 games (wink, wink) the world will truly be a good place to live in.   There are tons of other items to write on and on about, such as the game's generally smarter defensive AI (particularly in All-American mode); the great Dynasty Mode (play through five season as a coach and manage, trade, hire, fire, and hopefully win the big bowls -- or get fired trying); three new camera angles (dynamic blimp cam, blimp cam, and dynamic cam); and Great Games, which includes 20 more classic match-ups.   In the end, NCAA Football 99 is a good game, with a few problems here and there, but nothing so annoying that you would ever want to return it. Better than last year, but still not our favorite gridiron title, NCAA gets the same score as last year, despite the fact that it's better (sometimes ratings just don't tell the whole story).  Like the old adage goes, if you love college football, you should definitely take a good look at EA's newest NCAA Football 99.  Douglass Perry", "date": "Aug 29, 1998"}
