We said it before and it's still true: at least it doesn't have any cute Nintendo mascot characters in it. Featuring a handful of the finest tennis players in the world, AST delivers some excellent motion captured tennis animations and clever arcade modes. The main problem with the game is its lack of depth as far as characters and gameplay. It's a nice alternative to the typical sports game but it probably won't have the legs to get over with the more fickle N64 owner.  Features:  8 licensed WTA & ATP tennis players and 4 fictional players. Progressive levels of singles and doubles competition. 6 strategic shots to choose from: slice, smash, back spin, top spin, lob and volley. 2 special shots for each character. Multiplayer options: 8 player tournament, 4 player simultaneous.  8 different clay, grass and indoor courts from around the world. Hidden secrets.   Gameplay: Tennis is one sport that makes a great videogame because of the speed and intricacies of the game. It's just a matter of wrist angle that determines whether a ball is in or out. The toughest part of AST is that the control system requires you to move your character all over the court and direct the shot with the analog stick. What most players will end up doing is navigating the player to the right place on the court and hitting the A, B or C-down button to begin the racket swinging animation and then holding the control stick in the direction you want the shot to go. All of this happens in less than a second, which isn't a problem for the typical gamer's hand-eye coordination. The problem is that AST has a little trouble keeping track of when you're doing what. If you're leaning hard on the control stick to get your guy or gal in place to hit the ball and you quickly tap the swing button, the game may not recognize the command quickly enough and you've already started to lean the control stick in another direction to change the shot's angle. This can get a little frustrating since you're quick enough to make the play, but the machine isn't.   The game can end up being a little fun if you learn its timing and know when to hit the swing button and redirect with the control stick. It can be learned, but it just isn't as fun when you're having to play the game a little slower than you'd like. This affects the other game play modes like Bomb tennis which is a tough enough challenge on its own.  Bomb tennis is a simple concept where a little cartoon bomb is placed on the court whenever and wherever the tennis ball hits the court. The little rascal sits there for a length time determined by the angle and length of the shot and blows up in a big orange and yellow explosion. While it's a neat concept at first, you quickly realize that the object of the game is to dodge the bombs, not make good tennis shots. If you land a nice backhand just inside the corner it won't count for diddly if you get blown up by a nearby bomb at the same time. Rather than bombs becoming obstacles to avoid while getting your tennis game on, they become threats to the players themselves and should be avoided at all costs. Like those cursed fleas in the old Centipede game.   The hook for the AST may not come from the game of tennis that it plays, but the tennis players featured in the game. In addition to the handful of original players, All-Star Tennis '99 grabbed the likenesses of 5 top ranked male players (Richard Krajicek, Mark Philippoussis, Gustavo Kuerten, Jonas Bjorkman and Michael Chang) and 3 top ranked female players (Jana Novotna, Amanda Coetzer, Conchita Martinez) complete with their trademark outfits like Kuerten's yellow and blue outfits and Novotna's headbands. While this adds a healthy dose of realism to the game since each character has the strengths and weaknesses of their real life counterparts, you almost wish there more real players to choose from. A marginally popular sport among videogamers like tennis needs all of the licensing help it can get to get players excited. Real courts, more real players and even some legends of the past would have been huge pluses for AST. Recreating classic Grand Slam matchups (Any McEnroe-Lendl match from the '80s) or even some interesting matches that could never be (Venus Williams versus Chris Evert Lloyd perhaps?) would have been a lot of fun.  Graphics There's some fine motion capturing in AST and it's easy to get caught just watching the players go through their moves. Mundane acts like players wiping the bottom of their shoes or bouncing the ball repeatedly before the serve are expertly done. The problem is there are merely suggestions of facial features and the players can look a little jaggy at times as they move especially when you look at the player in the nearcourt.  At various points in the game, usually after a winning shot or just before a serve, there can be a little problem with framerate. Guys or girls will simply ~pop~ into different positions rather than actually moving their arms and legs into place. It happens sometimes during gameplay especially when you intentionally or accidentally send your player diving for the ball. This combined with the control problems we've already mentioned can be extremely frustrating.   There are some cool tidbits like the previously mentioned clothing variations, but on switchovers and after matches you can see the different name brand rackets each player is carrying. Very cool considering many companies just paint their logos onto the face mesh of the tennis racket.   Sound The audio components of AST are very good. The snooty British announcer delivers some of the finest lines in any sports game. Should the fans suddenly start cheering too loudly for one athlete over another, by name that is, he'll quickly tell them to pipe down in a very believable agitated tone of voice. When some poor sap gets a call on his cellular phone, first you'll hear the ring, then you'll hear everyone start giggling and laughing and then the announcer kicks in. ~Quite please. QUIET PLEASE!~ with a snobbish accent that would piss of most people.   Beyond the announcer you'll get the steady bounce of the tennis ball off the court and racket. Hearing the fans suddenly yell out and cheer on their favorite players by name is quite a nice surprise. As we said though they're usually quickly hushed by the intolerant announcer. All Star Tennis '99 gets a tremendous amount of slack because it's the first tennis game on the console. The problem is that three years into the lifespan of the N64, this game still has a lot of things wrong with it that you just know would be fixed and polished if it was the second or third version of the game. Being the first game of its kind with some great animations and sound doesn't relieve AST from the old usuable control and framerate responsibility that all games must bear. It's a wonderful change of pace game that will keep you playing for a little longer than you would expect if you just want to get away from Goldeneye or Vigilante 8. The problem is, not many of us can afford to buy games that we know are only going to be used to occasionally clean the palate. If you're a tennis fan, though, give it a rent and see if how the first sim of your favorite sport looks on the N64.", "date": "Sep 16, 1999"}
