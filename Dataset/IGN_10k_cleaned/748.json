Well, looky here, Newkidco has done just that -- handing the cute game over to Torus Games (the developer of such Game Boy Color games as Duke Nukem, Yoda Stories, and NBA Showtime). It doesn't have the presentation of the PlayStation game, but the substance has been translated over nearly intact -- though the game doesn't seem to play as tightly or seem as fun as it did on the console.  Features 11 lands with multiple levels  Bonus rounds Storybook mode Password save For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  The idea is very much what you'd get if you crossed Lost Vikings with Tetris. Guide Hello Kitty around the playfield to collect icons -- collect all the icons, and you've cleared the level. While you're not in complete control of Hello Kitty, you can tell her to walk or run to the left or right by holding down the Select button and pressing left or right. She'll climb up single blocks in her way, but walk the other way when there are more than that. She'll also act like a Lemming by falling off edges -- so be careful, since she'll stun herself if she falls too far. It's not deadly, but she'll be out of commission for a few seconds after a particularly nasty fall. But if she falls through the floor into nothingness, the level has to be restarted.  While you tell Hello Kitty to run left and right, blocks fall from the top of the screen of different colors. They'll fall as one, two, three or four blocks in formation, and you have the ability to rotate the formation as they fall. Moving the joypad will move the blocks. The idea is to make ~staircases~ for Hello Kitty to climb so she can reach the icons she needs to collect. Linking three or more blocks of the same color will cause them to disappear -- both helpful and a hindrance. Once a stack of blocks disappear, other blocks nestle into place. And like the PlayStation version of the game, there really doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for how far the extra blocks will fall. This little element really makes for some seriously annoying gameplay.   One more factor to take into account -- the other characters, like Badtz-Maru (a cranky penguin), Pandaba (a big-headed panda) and Hanamaru (a seal?). These guys will try to make it more difficult for Hello Kitty to pick up her icons. Badtz-Maru will get pissed off every time Hello Kitty picks up an icon, and kick the nearest block -- causing others to fall. Pandaba gets equally upset, but she'll rotate four cubes 90 degrees. Hanamaru just walks around, getting in your way. But they don't harm Hello Kitty -- she can walk on their skulls for an extra lift.  Yes, it's cute, and yes, it's for kids. That's one of the problems with the Game Boy Color version -- it's a bit on the complex side in terms of what each of the character sprites do. The PlayStation version had a great tutorial in the early levels that taught you exactly what Badtz-Maru would do when you grabbed an icon. There's no tutorial in the portable version, so you're left playing the trial-and-error game figuring the little nuances out.  The controls also don't feel as tight as they did on the PlayStation game, seeming a bit sluggish to maneuver the cubes from one side of the screen to the other.  The audio also suffers compared to the crisp, clear sound of the PlayStation game -- Torus digitized a few choice samples from the console, but the music itself is just not as cheery and lively as it was originally. Granted, it's not being spooled off a CD, but still -- the game needs a bit of audio pep.   I think the presentation of the Game Boy Color version hurts the game most of all, considering Hello Kitty Cube Frenzy was one of the cheeriest, happiest games I've ever played on the PlayStation. It's not a bad game on the portable, but it's just not a game that grabs you and keeps you going like Tetris or Puyo Puyo would. It's very much just an average title on the Game Boy Color.", "date": "Mar 2, 2000"}
