I mean, much of the focus is turning menial, real life tasks like housecleaning, landscaping, and scavenging, into gameplay elements that, when combined, make the design come together. What it does, and in turn where it excels, is give the players a really excellent sense of accomplishment and personal expression, and the Nintendo DS does more or less everything that the GameCube version did, with the added incentive of going online and opening up their pride and joy for everyone else to enjoy. This portable version doesn't go above and beyond the original GameCube design that kicked off the series, but for those who haven't hit the forest before, you may find yourself surprisingly addicted to the chore-laden animal world.   The original Animal Crossing was one of Nintendo's first ~non-gamer games~ for the not-so-hardcore player, a demographic that the company's been targeting a lot harder lately. Like its Nintendogs product, Animal Crossing doesn't really have an end or even a hard goal to accomplish. It's an evergreen design where players live a life in a fantasy world the way they want. Alone or with friends, players simply enjoy themselves in a laidback environment making the village their own; customize the landscape with trees and flowers, create clothing patterns and trade them with the inhabitants, catch fish and bugs and donate them to the local museum.  It's a design  that's meant to grab players' attention for not just days, but for weeks and even months after the purchase. There's no twitch action or even challenging gameplay here, but Animal Crossing still manages to suck the player in with tons of stuff to do and enjoy.   Even after several weeks of hanging out in Animal Crossing, only a fraction of the game shows its face to the player. Events -- flea markets, timed holidays, appearance of out-of-town animals like hair stylists and merchants - are all based upon the Nintendo DS system's internal clock, and half the fun is booting up your game to see what's the next scheduled event to pop up in your village. The designers do a fantastic job making the game feel like it's a living, breathing world no matter if the system's on or off - Animal Crossing keeps on going even if you're not there to enjoy it.   Animal Crossing: Wild World is meant to be an original design in the franchise, yet for people who have already gone through months and months of building up their villages in the GameCube version, it really feels like a repeat for about 90 percent of the DS edition. The designers didn't do enough to make the game its own design, so it's not entirely attractive to people who've already experienced all this before. There are plenty of reasons to do it all again - mostly the online aspect - but it's clear that the company is holding a lot of its drastic changes for the next-generation design.        The GameCube game is definitely used as a foundation for the Nintendo DS version, but things have been changed and shifted around both to work within the freedom and confines of the portable environment, as well as fix and improve on the original game design. Inventory management, for example, works more intuitively thanks to the touch screen control of the DS; swapping in and out of costumes and headgear, for example, is a simple matter of dragging and dropping items from the pocket onto the players' persona. Some tasks have been streamlined to speed things up, like having the ability to combine multiple items or letters when selling or shipping.     Cool and clever new elements have been added to the mix, like the ability to shoot down random, rare presents that float across the sky with a slingshot. Animals can now have relationships within the players' villages to spice up the dialogue and add new tasks between characters. Additional elements of customization are also available: players can jot up their own constellation in the night sky, as well as wear a much larger assortment of clothing that goes beyond the GameCube's shirt. The ability to buy hats, glasses, and other headgear opens up a lot more opportunity for personal expression.    But even with the freedom of the touchscreen, Nintendo doesn't really take the Nintendo DS version down a path that takes advantage of this touch screen control. Sure, the ability to paint and write becomes a lot more intuitive with the ability to draw and type with the accuracy of the stylus. But there are missed opportunities to really showcase the Animal Crossing gameplay in a touch-screen environment. Fishing, for example, could have been a lot more involved and fun had the controls and interface changed - instead, it's a basic control of tapping the screen to cast, tapping the screen to reel the fish in. Not very creative. And even though players can control their character with the stylus exclusively, this input is sometimes too clunky for tasks that require a bit of digital accuracy. Digging holes, chopping trees, and moving furniture is much more intuitive with the D-pad/button combo, and don't be surprised if you find yourself swapping to that control on the fly.   The Nintendo DS design does lack the initial incentive to get the adventure started. On the GameCube (and in turn, the Nintendo 64 Japan-only release), the designers snuck in a batch of emulated NES games and rewarded players with an original game right at the beginning of their life in Animal Crossing. Whether or not the NES games were the reason players booted up the game, it's hard to argue that the NES games were a driving force to keep players' interests as a dangling carrot. There's no hard goal in Animal Crossing other than creating the best life possible in the village, but the NES games created an incentive to get players working towards the first real goal in the game: find all the classics. The Nintendo DS version, however, lacks this incentive. The entire design doesn't suffer as a result of this omission, but it does feel a bit slower to get going since the Nintendo DS version of the game doesn't dangle any carrot in front of the players' noses right from the start.          Though the removal of NES games is a huge omission, Nintendo makes up for it in a huge way by giving gamers the biggest request made of players when the GameCube version was making the rounds: a full, multiplayer experience. On the GameCube, players could only visit others' villages if they had access to the same GameCube and that player's memory card. That player couldn't be on at the same time, nor could other players interact with each other in the same or opposing villages. On the Nintendo DS, this limitation is removed thanks to the system's wireless connectivity functions, and going even further than that is the ability to hop on the internet and open up your village to other players. This is a huge step up from the GameCube's system of trading items via a clunky password - now its a matter of opening up the gate and letting them in to check out your village.     There are limitations to the multiplayer aspect of Animal Crossing, and though there's a lot of potential in the remote connectivity, it's not all it could have been. Chatting between players is available, it's incredibly restrictive with no chat log or a useable area of text to type. Animals escape indoors when villages are available for friends to visit, which makes it nearly impossible for visitors to join in on standard village events. Four players can be in the same village at the same time, but only two players can occupy any one buildingincluding the multi-room museum. Players can only send mail to other players by visiting their village and mailing it to them from that player's local post office. And standard functions, like constellation or pattern editing, are disabled the moment any visitor hits a remote village. The biggest limitation is the requirement of Friend Codes to visit remote villages - it's a ~play it safe~ strategy by Nintendo so that kids aren't exposed to the horrors of unknown people, but the company could have offered neutral, Nintendo-sponsored and maintained villages for players who don't have friends online. As it stands, though, the only way to get online is to have a Friend Code already entered into the cartridge.   But even with these limits, the online element opens up a lot of cool elements. Patterns that visitors create can be posted in others' villages, which can then be picked up by other villagers and displayed. Player-created constellations can end up in visited villages. Letters written to neighboring animals will be saved and carried over when these animals leave, which means they could potentially read their letters outloud to other Animal Crossing players. This game is incredibly viral in design, and it becomes even moreso now that players can go online. Animal Crossing players can end up with patterns, constellations, letters and other items from unknown people simply from these elements moving from system to system to systemand that's pretty darn cool. And unlike Mario Kart DS, Animal Crossing's internet support is just as full-featured as the local wireless connectivity - Nintendo did not strip any functionality out of multiplayer to get the game to work online.         It's been more than two years since Animal Crossing sucked me into its world on the GameCube. Admittedly the initial reason I got into that experience was to score all the NES systems for my virtual, upstairs, Animal Crossing gameroom, so to have that element stripped out of the Nintendo DS sequel was like a dagger to the heart.Luckily, the Animal Crossing design is still plenty engaging to work a new life on the portable Nintendo DS system, and it wasn't hard to get right back up on that horse and start anew. The game really does make more sense as a handheld game, especially since I no longer have to tote the much more clunky GameCube along to parties just so I can see the animals in my village celebrate the New Year or events like Toy Day - now I can simply whip out my dual-screen portable and join in on the festivities.The online component was something that the original GameCube design screamed for, and Nintendo delivered for the Nintendo DS version. Mostly. It's still a bit on the limited side, with restrictions showing their faces every time you try to explore the design in the online environment. But for the most part, Nintendo gave us everything we were asking for when playing the GameCube version: a much more intuitive way of trading items and enjoying other players' creations. And, at the very least, the company succeeded. There's plenty of room for improvement, but I've definitely been enjoying what the company offered for Animal Crossing: Wild World's online experience.I can definitely see why Animal Crossing wouldn't appeal to some folk - the game is incredibly laid back with no real goals, and much of its gameplay involves doing tasks that you're trying to avoid doing in real life by playing videogames in the first place. But the game's ability to give the players a sense of accomplishment with all that you can do and experience is enormously rewarding and, at least to me, incredibly addictive. And the ability to enjoy all this with players all over the country is all the more reason to continue living and thriving in Animal Crossing.", "date": "Dec 6, 2005"}
