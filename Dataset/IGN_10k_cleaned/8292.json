Yes, it's fantastic for mini-games, throwaway sports fun or some frantic arm-wiggling joy but those expecting character progression, drama or - God forbid - a story are pretty much limited to Twilight Princess. Praise be for Heatseeker then, which is currently one of the few 'proper' titles on the console. It has a plot, voiceovers, characters, mission briefings - woo, we're feeling positively giddy from all this 'depth' - and still manages to be as fun as some of the more silly Wii titles.   Piloting a plane that has its tail on fire isn't advisable.  At first glance, Heatseeker perhaps isn't your stereotypical Nintendo console fodder. After all, it features high-speed planes battling it out in dogfights while army-types talk about 'downing bogies' - ostensibly, it's got all the 'serious' flight sim trimmings hardcore top guns or wannabe pilots would ever need. However, Heatseeker favours ridiculous over-the-top action and kill counts in the dozens. Boring realism averted, then. In essence, Heatseeker is a throwback to arcade flight games of yore like Afterburner or Ace Combat. Armed with an unlimited supply of missiles, bombs and bullets you use the Wiimote and Nunchuk to fly through a series of increasingly tricky dogfights and bombing runs in a range of high-speed fighter jets.   Players don the helmet of rookie pilot Mike 'Downtown' Hudson who's fired at mach speed into a world of terrorism and drug smuggling. In your quest to rid the world of airborne aggressors, you travel the globe - visiting four different locations, including the Caribbean and Antarctica. Each area plays host to multiple stages however, with Campaign mode consisting of 18 separate missions in total. That may not sound a lot but each is fairly hefty with numerous objectives to complete. Furthermore, there's the opportunity to replay each stage in Missions mode, using planes you've unlocked through objectives in the main game. So, you know, the sky's the limit.   Each plane has a lot of detail and even the tiniest parts move realistically.  Mission objectives are structured extremely well, ensuring there's always something happening, with a constant stream of fresh bogies breathing down your flight suit. Although the original aim of a mission mgiht be to scan a cargo ship or escort a transport from the airfield, objectives literally change on the fly, keeping you on your (airborne) toes at all times.   Of course, it doesn't matter how exciting missions are if controls aren't up to scratch. Thankfully then, Codemasters has pulled them off masterfully. Interestingly, rather than using the Wii Remote's motion-sensing abilities, planes are piloted by guiding a target around the screen, which your aircraft then follows. Less surprisingly, this target also acts as an aiming reticule. Admittedly, it does take a little practice before you're navigating with confidence, but pretty soon you'll be zipping through the skies with effortless fluidity.     However, we do have a few control gripes - most noticably, thanks to Heatseeker's obvious beginnings on PS2. It's pretty apparent that the developers just ran out of buttons in the transition to Wii - and the work-arounds don't always, well, work. For example, zooming in on a target, giving orders to wingmen and operating stealth mode all require D-pad combinations. Unfortunately, Codemasters's solution, requiring multiple button presses to activate your command of choice, is far from elegant. Considering the action comes thick and fast, the last thing you want to be doing is faffing about trying to tell your wingmen to protect an ally and frustration can set in. What's more, avoiding enemy attacks requires you to jerk the Wiimote - something which becomes all too imprecise, particularly during the intensive missile attacks in later stages. Of course, over-enthusiastic jerking means you frequently lose your pointer on-screen, causing mayhem with your navigation.   Look at the lovely clouds. Forget those planes dog fighting and stuff.  Even so, Heatseeker pilots its way through these problems simply by being a lot of fun. Dogfighting against enemies is a joy, particularly in the later stages when foes dodge lock-ons at the last minute and fight back with real gusto. In fact, the only time the pace really lets up is when trying to destroy boats. Unfortunately, this lacks both the skill and precision of air-to-air combat due to the tedious, repetive run-and-bomb mechanics. In all honesty, it's a chore wiping things out with the slow-loading bombs and, each time a new boat objective appeared, we rolled our eyes and willed the imminent arrival of more action-packed dogfights.   Admittedly, the lack of environmental variety during dogfights is a bit of a blow - frankly, there're only so many tiny islands we can take while engaging in perilous open air combat. As it stands, there's little to distinguish one area from another, making for a certain degree of monotony throughout proceedings. We'd have liked to see the inclusion of cities or canyons, for example, to spice things up and actually make some demands of our increased flying proficiency.   Downing planes with a well-timed missile is very rewarding.  While we're on the subject of variety, it's worth mentioning Heatseeker's visuals - which are nothing if not varied in terms of quality. While in the air, Heatseeker is an attractive proposition, with great detail on each plane and some of the best clouds we've seen in a game. On the ground however, it's extremely ugly: trees, for instance, look so haphazardly crafted, you can see where they've been cut around and pasted into position. Some flashy explosions do their best to distract, but it's hard to ignore the horrible island-bound detail as you fly overhead.Ultimately, Heatseeker is a welcome addition to the Wiis catalogue. Its one of the few games that isnt a proof of concept for the consoles innovative controller. Instead its a fully-fledged title that happens to use the Wiimote extremely well. Controlling a plane at break-neck speeds is beautifully fluid using the Remote and - aside from some fiddly button commands - you feel connected to the flying experience at all times. Intensive missions and gruelling dogfights also work particularly well, making for one of the more exhilarating games in Wii's catalogue  bested only by Excite Truck.However, Codemasters is limited by its scope: theres not enough variation across levels and, once youve completed the main game, theres little incentive to return. A multiplayer or challenge mode would have turned Heatseeker into a top gun but unfortunately, as it is, its only a gutsy rookie.", "date": "Mar 27, 2007"}
