Consider, for instance, the neverending stream of free products.  Then there's the opportunity to view long awaited objects of the public's affection weeks and even months sometimes before they hit stores.  But take a moment to think about the downsides of the career...you have to play the bad games along with the good.    First-person shooters have been done to death; you know it as well as I do.  Yet publishers need successful genres to clone and manufacture en masse, otherwise there'd be nothing else inside their over inflated cardboard $19.99 'xtreme' packages but 3 page manuals and styrofoam peanuts.  Mind you, though, that'd be a step in the right direction. WizardWorks knows this approach more intimately than anyone besides the vaunted producers of Taiwanese Rolex knock-offs.  Cash money moolah in mind, they've churned out yet another pass at non-violent shooter action, which, although peachy keen from a public relations standpoint, absolutely blows chunks for John Q. Public.  Were Mr. Q Public to invest in this poorly designed offal, he'd suffer the indignity of a once fast-paced action game's painful bout with manic depression.  Though there's a quartet of play modes to choose from in addition to a practice round, not a one's remotely arousing.  And by that we don't just mean a buzzkill... we're talking about a turn-off of Madonna sized proportions.  Capture the Flag, for example, is just what it sounds like, except for the fact that the computer can't hit the broad side of a barn and your teammates never show any interest in the opposing squad's banner.  Players itching for instant gratification might look to the Free For All or Siege options, but they're about as visceral as an episode of The Golden Girls.  Left to rub salt in the wound is Speedball, a game of last man standing that's so devoid of depth it was originally codenamed Daikatana.  While both single and multiplayer modes are available, you'd be lucky to find competition even if you bribed them to play.  Choppy graphics kill the fluidity, so that instead of smooth, uninterrupted motion, players travel in jagged lines, when they're not too disoriented to move, that is.  Games continue indefinitely, ceasing only for a few seconds to announce your victory or loss before starting a new session.  Weapon, hopper (ammo reserve) and gun barrel upgrades are the only other reward for having patience with this ungrateful sucker, though the performance of your dangerously inaccurate sidearm, aside from its firing rate, isn't remarkably improved by the equipment.  If the best thing players can hope for after playing twenty minutes is a dot or laser scope targeting cursor, then it's likely they won't fiddling around with the title much longer.  Yet good graphics can occasionally pull a real stinker back from the brink.  But the issue of redemption isn't called into debate, because the starched collar stiff, smudgy outdoor environments sink like a rock.  Foxy character models are much easier on the eyes, though your choice of skins and colors is frighteningly limited.  It's a very, very bad sign when the most colorful objects on the screen are splatters left behind by errant paintball shots.  The puny library of sound effects rests on shaky footing as well, as do the retarded taunts that you can offer up by pressing the numeric buttons.  Even if this low-budget atrocity was made by the Deer Hunter people, it deserved better.  And there you have it in a nutshell.  The game officially sucks, in large part due to the lack of ingenuity shown by its creators, but mainly because of shoddy gameplay and dense AI (perhaps they were going for Absence of Intelligence?).  Take Nerf Arena Blast, gut out the workmanlike level design and fun-filled variations, and it'd look a lot like the horror that's galavanting about Wal-Mart as High Impact Paintball.  If you ever encounter a member of the design team on the proving grounds, in the name of all that's holy, don't think twice about aiming below the belt.  After all, turnabout's fair play.  -- Scott Steinberg      Want to share your opinions with the world?
