The story goes something like this: natural disasters of biblical proportions have caused the ice sheets to melt, resulting in drastically altered ocean water levels.  You know what that means - almost everything is drowning in lots and lots of ocean water.    Fast forward to the 24th century.  The equator is now the dividing line between peace and war.  The people of the southern hemisphere created the Southern Alliance and live in peace and harmony, while the northern hemisphere is ruled by three tyrannical and mad overlords who intend on destroying the South.  Your job is to use your Seablade, an air-sea rescue vehicle, to rescue hostages, liberate the oppressed citizens of the north, and destroy the three feudal tyrants.  All in a day's work, right?       Gameplay SeaBlade reminds me a lot of the recently updated Defender; you fly around an open environment while picking up civilians and safely delivering them to a drop zone, all the while fighting off enemies and trying to survive yourself.  There is a little variety in the missions, such as when you have to fly through a certain number of floating markers within a set amount of time, or having to pick up and drop off supplies, but most of the time you'll flying back and forth through the levels, acting as a high-tech chauffeur.    The idea of having a vehicle that flies and can go underwater is great, and SeaBlade manages to pull off the idea pretty well.  The control is tight and mostly responsive, and each ship feels a little different.  The physics also feel good.  The way your ship flies and turns in the air feels like a SeaBlade should (I assume anyways), and when you dive into the sea, you feel the momentum shift as the friction of the water makes you a little more sluggish in your movements.  I do wish that the water elements were more fleshed out though.  You spend much more time in the air than you do the sea, which is strange since the game is called SeaBlade, not AirAndSomeWaterBlade.  And how about a real ~sea.~  It would've been great if you could've dived hundreds of feet into an ocean full of sea life and had some more submarine-like battles.  Conversely, I would've liked to have been able to fly higher into the air.  There is an invisible ceiling that is set way too low.  So in the end, you can fly and you can swim, but you'll never drown or have a fear of heights.        The game's version of Texas.  Scary.  So what else is wrong with this game?  Plenty.  One of the problems is the targeting/arrow system.  You'll see a red arrow indicator that will always point in the direction of incoming fighter planes.  It works fine, and there isn't too much to complain about it.  The problem is that most of the time you aren't being attacked by other SeaBlades, but by gun turrets set up all around the environment, and the arrow indicator does not show you where they are - you have to spot them yourself.  This can become an exercise in frustration as you wonder where the hell you're getting hit from.  Add to that the fact that your auto-aim function won't lock onto a gun turret until you are dangerously close, and you'll find yourself dying quite frequently.    Also, controlling your SeaBlade, while doable, could use a little bit of tweaking.  I used the default control scheme where the right analog stick would move the SeaBlade and the left  stick is used for looking.  Now the D-pad is used for strafing, but trying to circle strafe using the left stick and the D-pad while trying to use the right trigger to shoot is not going to happen.  I mean, it could, but it's not very practical.  Challenging, yes, but for the wrong reasons.  You can change the control setup, but as the default config, many casual gamers may not do so.         There is a multi-player mode included in SeaBlade that includes three modes: Chaos Reigns (deathmatch), Tag, and Moving Target.  While the inclusion of a multi-player mode is appreciated, it's mainly useless in SeaBlade.  It is more or less just like the single player campaign (same ships, same environments, etc), except you're fighting against a buddy rather than the computer.  You also get all the problems associated with the single player game, including the aiming and control.  There was very little thought put into this.  Next time maybe we'll see some multi-player tweaking and enhancements.      Graphics Seablade is a decent-looking game.  While not ugly by any means, it has little to no ~wow~ factor about it; very cookie-cutter graphics pulled straight from a free CD of generic videogame clipart.  The characters exude a very typical cartoon look - simple models with exaggerated features.  On top of that, they have that shiny, plastic look, like they were modeled out of your younger brother's old bottle of Vaseline.  From a company that specializes in creating graphics for clients, I hoped for a little more character and originality in the in the game's characters.    The actual ships in the game look a little better with their unique designs and mechanics.  It's nice to see the different parts of your ship move as you turn, boost, and brake.  The first SeaBlade you start out with is a good example of this, as it's four ~wings~ contract and expand as you traverse the skies (and seas).  The textures on the ships also look decent, though as to why they aren't bump-mapped and the like is beyond me.  SeaBlade definitely isn't pushing graphical barriers on the Xbox, which is also odd since the game is only on the Xbox.  Instead it looks like it was made to be ported over to other systems.  At this time in the Xbox's life, we really should be seeing games that are more along the lines of say Splinter Cell or Steel Battalion.    Again, this isn't a bad-looking game.  It moves a relatively consistent framerate, there are real-time reflections on the water (though not of your SeaBlade), and there is little draw-in or pop-up.  It's just that there is nothing to set this game visually apart from any other mediocre shooter.  The environments that the game uses - the water, the snow, mountains, etc - provide plenty of potentially interesting situations and locales that could have looked amazing had they been properly done.  It's too bad that that all that potential was left untapped.  And what's with the moon?              You didn't know SeaBlade was romantic did you? Sound The music in SeaBlade is surprisingly good.  It's not a magnificent, film-like score, but it's also not that futuristic dance/beat music that seems to be in every other game.  Who decided that that is what games are supposed to sound like anyways?  They need to be burned.  Anyways, back to the game.  The music consists of orchestrated pieces with a dash of electronics thrown in for good measure.  Not quite as epic as Craig Armstrong's The Space Between Us, but it has a lot more life and energy than your average game.  The voice acting in the game is also pretty good - somewhere in between Resident Evil and Baldur's Gate quality.  It's believable enough so that you won't consciously be thinking about how campy it sounds.    The sound effects also don't disappoint.  Explosions sound big enough, and the rat-tat-tat of your machine gun definitely cuts.  Also, when you submerge your ship in water, everything, including your guns, gives off a muffled sound, as they should underwater.  You can even hear what sounds like whale mating calls, though I have yet to see any single whales on the prowl.       Like many new ideas and concepts, the initial attempt is often times full of problems, as is the case with SeaBlade.  If the game's ideas were more fleshed-out, and there was a little more balancing and tweaking, the game could be great; but until that day comes, Seablade is just another shooter that really isn't worth your time.
