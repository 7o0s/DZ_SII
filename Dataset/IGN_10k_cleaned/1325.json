Nostalgic cops n' robbers action?  Been there, done that with Driver, and we're still waiting for Starsky & Hutch.  High stakes futuristic fare? As if there weren't enough titles in that category, ranging from Pod to Dethkarz.  Cartoon craziness?  See Beetle Buggin' or Go Kart Challenge.  Good ol' boy racing - now there's a niche we've yet to explore.  Hot on the heels of Breakneck, SouthPeak Interactive's first major inroad into the automotive category (play Boss Rally and you'd discount it too), comes Dukes of Hazzard.  Playing off America's penchant for sentimentality, this story driven arcade racer cops its license not from a major motion picture or cult comic book, but from one of the downright cheesiest TV shows ever created.  Folks who love to ridicule the redneck stereotype couldn't dream up a better theme, as the game follows the exploits of two brothers, Bo and Luke Duke, as they deal with the local yokels that inhabit the ass-backwards Hazzard County.  Part of the package deal included appearances and voice-overs from the series' most beloved characters, including Luke Duke, Roscoe P. Coltrane, Enos Strate, Cooter Davenport and The Balladeer (played by Waylon Jennings), who narrates the episodic encounters.  Additional 'celebrities' such as Daisy Duke, Boss Hogg and Uncle Jesse are on set as well to give the title that authentic look and feel fans crave.  Every bit as impressive as the cast are the cameos made by vehicles such as the Gray Ghost and Double Zero and the list of familiar landmarks that encompasses Cooter's Garage, The Boar's Nest, and other hot spots of interest to those who grew up on the program.  Comfortable as the setting may be, you'll have a heck of a time getting your hands around the driving model.  Built like a boat, the world-famous General Lee handles like a Sherman tank.  Straight runs are a piece of cake, but try to turn this bad boy on a dime and it flounders, with either the front or back end carrying the rest of the car into a complete spinout.  Thanks to arcade-style physics, the vehicle puts on a quite a show during grounded or airborne bungles, which send it rolling, twisting and careening end over end into guard rails and embankments.  Time spent observing mishaps is time that's sorely wasted when attempting to aright oneself, however.  Roadblocks and unforeseen obstacles like oncoming traffic create do-or-die situations because of this condition.  Episodes, chopped up into scenes, set the stage for each mini-storyline that's introduced.  The gameplay revolves around the plot, so it's slightly different from one stage to another.  Races against the clock are joined by chase scenes in which the Duke brothers must smash into a pickup truck to disable it, avoid the incompetent cop sequences and similar fare.  A damage display that uses colors to convey wear 'n tear is Bo and Luke's steady companion, reminding you that despite the mission goals assigned, the first order of business is to keep the General Lee in tip-top shape.  Multiplayer variations, including time trial, race, and run the jug (also known as 'how long can I hold onto the hooch' mode) are the best way to get some practice behind the wheel.    Powerups, located in dark-colored crates, put some pep in the brothers' step and improve your chances of victory.  Nitro boosts, toolboxes (instant 100% repairs), spare tires, and oil slicks aren't nearly as exciting as the lone offensive weapon, though.  Put your grubby paws on an arrow icon and Luke'll hang out the window, putting his archery skills to the test on passing cars.  None of the powerups are especially functional, but you'd might as well make use of 'em for the hell of it.  Around fifteen years ago, the TV show might have been cutting-edge.  Lately, the syndicated re-runs haven't been very flattering to its image, and frankly, neither is this comptuer game.  While all of the heavily wooded tracks (designed for maximum dust/mud/gravel spray effect) get back to nature, none take advantage of the technological improvements that separate brand new 3D accelerated titles from the first-generation crop.  Comatose backgrounds full of trees, grass and the occasional building show absolutely no signs of life and radiate that cheap, value-priced feel that Dirt Track Racing and other kings of the closeout shelf cloak themselves in.  It's especially rewarding to run into a river and be told that the game's over with a text message stating that you dove into water, rather than being allowed to watch the disaster.  The coup de grace are special effects that are on par with the Army Men series, although instead of outdated, lame explosions, in this case you get hideous smoke, oil trail, spark, and skid mark representations.  A strangely hip country music soundtrack is betrayed by weak audio effects (I loves me some engine roar!), though the voice actors are the real draw.  You know you're a sucker for those ~Yeeeeeeee Haaaaaaawwww!~ catcalls and Waylon Jennings' charming accent.  Luke's cheers and jeers of ~Dang it, Bo!~ and Roscoe's blather (~Oooooh I'm in hot pursuit!) ring out across the barren landscape.  The two most important things to listen for are last minute directions and Daisy's alluring southern drawl.    Because the console version of Dukes of Hazzard was a bestseller, there's no excuse for SouthPeak to have gone Boss Hogg and pinched pennies on the presentation.  Due to this decision, it's harder to overlook some of the more glaring flaws, specifically the fact that the product's a smidgen below average as far as arcade racers go.  Pissy controls deflate the General Lee's tires as well, monkeywrenching what should have been the definitive campy stroll down memory lane.  Go on, buy it if you're a groupie, you know want it anyways, but don't be surprised if everyone else at the software store gives you the evil eye.  -- Scott Steinberg Want to share your opinions with the world?

The game doesn't offer anything more than just driving levels, but the missions vary enough to continue through the adventure to the very end of the tale in Hazzard County. It's a sort of hit-or-miss license -- the Dukes of Hazzard wasn't for everyone, and it really hasn't had mass appeal for over a decade. But if you liked the show, you'll probably like the game for its parallels. Other folk'll like it for its fun missions. Just don't go blind from the horrid graphics.", "date": "Oct 11, 2000"}
