Teaming up with other hobbyist Lynx programmers, the creator of T-Tris returns with his second homemade Lynx card. This time, he offers an assortment of popular games and demos, whose initials assemble to form the unusual name S.I.M.I.S.  The contents of S.I.M.I.S. are:   Snakebyte, by Matthis Domin. A version of the classic ~Snake~ computer game, where one or two players move a serpent through various rooms, trying to eat apples while avoiding a collision with the walls or its own growing body.   Invaders, by Bastian Schick. A version of Taito's world-famous Space Invaders video game for one or two players.   Mines, by Bastian Schick. A variation of the old ~Minefield~ computer game, in which the player must clear out and escape from various minefields, avoiding the hidden explosives planted in each one.   Isolation, by Bastian Schick. An original strategy game, where two players (human or computer) compete on a field of vanishing tiles, trying to isolate their opponent while avoiding the same fate.   ~Specials,~ by various programmers. A collection of graphic demos showing what else the Lynx can do (in theory). This consists of a texture-mapped 3-D maze, a level of the arcade game Marble Madness, an explorable level of the computer game Dungeon Master, and a spinning polygon sphere.   The two-player games support the ComLynx network, while Snakebyte and Isolation offer variable difficulty levels and other game options. Finally, the instruction sheet also mentions a fifth game hidden on the card; I admit that I haven't found it yet, but I wouldn't let it sway my opinion regardless.    I was disappointed with Bastian's earlier T-Tris for offering nothing more than a bare-bones version of Tetris on the Lynx. Happily, things are much better with S.I.M.I.S.; while none of the games are outstanding by themselves, together they form a reasonably-priced collection of simple, fun games. Snakebyte and Invaders offer fast arcade action, while Mines and Isolation appeal more to strategists.  All of the games are implemented well. Snakebyte is the friendliest title for beginners, with easy rules and a gradual increase in difficulty. Invaders is a little more frantic than the original Space Invaders, made slightly harder by the aliens' fast speed and occasional reversals. Mines plays about the same as the original, while Isolation is a surprisingly pleasant strategy game whose simple rules hide a few layers of subtlety. Finally, the ~Specials~ themselves are nice little extras that are sure to leave Lynx gamers with dreams of future titles.  There are no major problems in S.I.M.I.S., though there are a handful of minor quirks. The controls are a little touchy on occasion, with one tap on the pad or one press of a button turning into multiple taps, though this is seldom critical. Changing ~Specials~ is also a bit cumbersome, since you have to turn the Lynx off and on to go to the next demo. Admittedly, these are very minor quirks, but they're mildly disappointing given how well-assembled the rest of the card is.     Matching the simplistic nature of the games, the sights and sounds of S.I.M.I.S. are mostly uncomplicated efforts that are at once basic, functional, and appropriate. Sounds tend mostly toward basic beeps, boops, and explosions, with a few short tunes and sirens thrown in, and thankfully there's nothing that grows irritating over time. The graphics are slightly better; most of the games feature clean, easily-recognizable icons, though Invaders offers arcade-perfect aliens, and some of the demos will impress even the most jaded Lynx owner the first time he sees them. S.I.M.I.S. will not go down in history as a groundbreaking card, but it doesn't need to -- instead, this Lynx card delivers a worthwhile collection of uncomplicated titles. There's something here to please everyone, making S.I.M.I.S. a welcome addition to any Lynx collection.", "date": "Jul 7, 1999"}
