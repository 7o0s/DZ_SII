But in this case, it can't be overstated. ESPN NHL Hockey is the finest hockey video game we've ever played. This paragraph can stand for everything that follows. If you're a hockey fan, and you play video games, go buy the game. You will not be disappointed. If you enjoyed last year's effort (called NHL 2K3), you'll be pleased with the level to which Visual Concepts, Kush Games and ESPN Videogames (once called SEGA Sports) improved on their stellar season last year.    While the improvements are almost too numerous to mention, here's a summary. The graphics have been refined, the gameplay has been considerably tightened, the already great control has been made better, and there are several new modes to keep everyone quite happy. What's more, the excellent ESPN brand has been added to every facet of the game, from the theme music to the menus to the commentary, providing added clout to a game that doesn't need anything else to recommend it.   Features  As with ESPN NFL Football, the biggest feature to note is the aforementioned integration of the ESPN brand into the game. While it isn't quite the pronounced overhaul football received, the improvements are welcome and put to good use. Steve Levy greets gamers directly after the opening logos, acclimating users to the experience. Once the ESPN tempo is set, you are constantly reminded of it, which is a comfortable sensation for those who love sports.     In addition to the menus and stat screens, which look like they've been yanked directly out of an ESPN broadcast, the game boasts the vocal talents of Gary Thorne and Bill Clement, which add a lot of authenticity to the experience. More on these two in the Sound section of this review.    Following the lead of ESPN NFL Football, this game also offers something similar to The Crib, in The SkyBox. This is a place for players to manage unlockables and user records, and otherwise hang out for a little diversion. In the Game Room section of The SkyBox, like The Crib, there is a lovely Air Hockey table, except this one is unlocked right off the bat. There's also an area to check the all-time NHL records. Moving around the 'Box, you can go to a Trophy Room, where your user hardware is collected, or take a peek in the Stanley Cup cove, where the holy grail will sit if you have the chops to earn it.   Head-to-Head Available! Don't know which version of ESPN NHL Hockey to buy? We're going to tell you in this point-by-point breakdown, which details the differences between the PS2 and Xbox with screenshots and tons of info.  Buy or rent smart. Read this now!  Read It Now   Then there's the room dedicated to Challenge Mode. Here's where things get a little complicated. Unlike ESPN NFL Football, which unlocks specific items when you complete designated challenges during the game, ESPN NHL Hockey gives you points for your achievements, which can then be spent to buy various things: retro goalie masks, classic teams, and extra jerseys. There is no furniture and team memorabilia to accumulate here, and that is a little saddening. One of the coolest things about The Crib is that even if you only glance at it, you get a sense of just how much a gamer has unlocked. It would have been nice to standardize everything across the ESPN Videogames brand, so that the way you unlock things in NFL would apply to NHL and NBA as well. Still, The SkyBox is a nice way to handle unlockables in its own right--and the separate Stanley Cup room is a stroke of brilliance.     To add to all of the presentation enhancements that have been made, a couple of new modes have been thrown into the mix. There's the standard Exhibition, Season, Playoffs, Franchise and Tournament, but this year boasts two great new additions. The first of these is the Skills competition, which allows you to prove your players' worth in a series of contests. You can choose whether to compete against an opposing team, or go it alone and try to rack up points in Challenge Mode. With competition in accuracy, skating, breakaways and so on, these contests are a good way to brush up on skills, but also super-addictive in their own right. In fact, several sleep-deprived nights leading up to this review can be blamed on this very feature. It's a testament to this game's level of polish when one relatively small element can captivate so thoroughly.    In addition to the cool Skills play, there are also several Mini-Games, which provide a little extra fun for one and all. The Shootout, always a classic video game hockey mode, is on full display here, and just waiting for multiplayer action. But perhaps more fun is the Mini Rink, which soups up the arcade action by making the puck livelier, the rink smaller and the boards downright bouncy. Another great multiplayer mode, the Mini Rink is a welcome diversion if ever one needs a break from the sim-style game. There are two other Mini-Games unlockable: Pond Hockey and Super Speed, and both offer even more interesting alternatives to the main game... but you'll have to work to get them.    Of course, all of these are side dishes to the main game, and the main mode, which is Franchise. To make the general manager's job flow a little more smoothly this year around, a new email system keeps you informed of changes during the course of the season. It's a nice addition, as it keeps a lot of information in the same place, while pointing gamers to lesser-used functions they may want to look at. But it doesn't follow the football format close enough, which is another problem of standardization for fans of all ESPN games.    This system also isn't as involved as the one in the football game, but neither is the Franchise mode. Again, this seems to be the only real Achilles' heel of the series formerly known as NHL 2K. There just isn't as much depth as we'd like to see. Better trade logic, a more in-depth drafting system and smarter CPU AI vis a vis free agents would made this mode a lot more fun to play.     Still, there's a lot of customization available right off the bat, including Fantasy Draft and a Franchise Difficulty slider, which is an intriguing feature for GMs who want a challenge. There's also a Franchise Auto-save feature, which is quite handy.     To add a little more lasting appeal, the game is online once again. SEGA put a lot of resources into curbing online cheating this time around, so hopefully the problems that plagued last year's game will not resurface. It's still too early to tell.     Gameplay  The old saying goes, ~If it ain't broke, don't fix it.~ But Kush and Visual Concepts took that statement one further and changed it to, ~If it ain't broke, improve the hell out of it.~ Last year's game had very few gameplay problems, but those small ones have been addressed for the most part, leaving a slick game with an unbelievable number of control options.    The thing about the series, and last year's offering in specific, is that it makes all of the elements of hockey fun. Whereas other games focus on scoring and hitting as the only things to get excited about, ESPN NHL Hockey broadens the palette. Sure, it's fun to blaze a slap shot by a goalie, but it's also fun to deke a defender out of his shorts, pin someone against the boards, make a well-placed saucer-pass, or even send the puck around the boards to a waiting teammate.    However, all of these things wouldn't be any fun at all if the controls were too laborious, too difficult to learn, or too complex to pull off. Luckily, none of the above is true. There are several control setups, but by far the best is the Advanced setting, which allows you the full complement of maneuvers available to NHL players. Using combinations of buttons, this setup allows you to do all the things mentioned above, in addition to diving for the puck, blocking shots, hooking, shooting slapshots, deflecting shots, protecting the puck and more. It's not hard to pick up, either. A couple games with even the most Advanced control setup, and you'll be shucking and jiving like a real NHLer.    Taking a page out of EA's book, some deke moves have been added to the right analog as well. Now, you can skip the puck ahead and try to split the defenders by pressing toward the opponent's goal, or step over to the right or left to elude a defender by pressing that way on the stick. By pulling away from the goal, you can skate to a quick stop, making space and taking the opportunity to pass or rip a quick slap shot. While some of these maneuvers seem a little extreme at times, and cover somewhat too much ice, they are a welcome addition.    In order to excel at ESPN NHL, you'll have to either learn the full complement of moves, or stick to the default difficulty setting. Why? Because the CPU AI has gotten a lot better at taking the puck from you. Gone are the days of the end-to-end carry, finishing off with a quick deke and a goal. All of the computer-controlled players are much better at poking and prodding the puck from you, or hitting you slightly to create separation, then robbing you. Neutral zone play especially is quite frantic, and defenders (on both sides of the ice), do a much better job of getting meat in front of the net.     Playing defense against the CPU is also a lot more fulfilling. The computer will respect your body position and not make bad passes, which means that you can force play to the corner, clog up the middle, and generally protect the net better. This makes for less odd-man rushes and mismatches in the defensive zone. In addition, since the puck isn't as firmly magnetized to all of the players, you can use the poke check and minor body checks more effectively than in last year's game.     The goalies have also gotten smarter. One of the gripes about last year's game was that too many goalies were too good. That's still somewhat the case on the higher difficulty settings, but on the default setting, every goalie is fallible. But that doesn't mean that the goaltenders are stupid. They're exceedingly good at maintaining position and doing all of the little things--poking the puck away, getting the glove into a good spot to snag the high shot, and clamping the five hole shut. But they also give up a lot more rebounds than last year. This makes for more realism, and as a result, a lot more second chance goals. Another thing that allows for this is the fact that you can skate up to an uncontrolled puck and one-time it. This is key in rebound situations and faceoffs, and provides another electrifying way to score.    One disappointment, however, is the goalie passing. Since most players do not play the game exactly as hockey is played in the NHL, taking chances with the goalie passes, they rely on at least average passing skill from their goaltenders. But these goalies are pretty awful at distributing the biscuit, even under semi-auto and manual control settings. Either they dribble the puck out slowly, missing their target, or leave the puck off where only the enemy can get it.     Another minor disappointment is the array of difficulty settings. Whereas last year's goalies were too perfect at the default setting, this time they aren't quite good enough, mainly because the default is set at Rookie (one above Amateur). However, once you get into the realm of Pro difficulty, it isn't uncommon to tie a couple games in a row at 0-0. A setting between Rookie and Pro would have been perfect as a default setting, and would also yield more accurate NHL scores. Either that, or allow for a custom setting as ESPN NFL does.     Gripes aside, though, ESPN NHL has grown to be an even better, deeper, and more satisfying game. As a single player game, it is excellent. As a multiplayer game, it's borderline heavenly.   Graphics  It's hard to imagine a better-looking hockey game than this one. A great deal of attention to detail has been applied to this game, and the results are stunning. The first thing you'll notice is the ice. At the beginning of a period, when it is shiny and new, players reflect beautifully off of the surface, as does the jumbotron above. That's an impressive feat in and of itself, but as the period progresses, the ice accrues a layer of dust, and gets thoroughly scuffed and scratched by skate blades. The effect is nearly unnoticeable until it is cleaned off again and you can appreciate the sheen. But this is just one illustration of the subtle beauty that's pulled off here.        The arenas themselves also look gorgeous. The plexiglass is fluid and amazing, and the few fans that get airtime (leaping up during exciting plays) look great in the background. But it doesn't end there. The player models are the best around, and finally this year, real attention has been paid to player faces. Now, if you're looking at Martin St. Louis, you'll know it. Even the goalies' faces have been successfully conveyed... an embarrassment of riches.    But the models wouldn't be anything without excellent animation, and that's also on display. There are some cool new wrinkles we haven't seen in years' past, and they look quite good. For instance, one check animation hits low and somersaults the opposing player up and over. There are checks into the benches, and even an animation of a goal being scored after the player leaves his feet. Mighty impressive, and all of it is chained together beautifully.    The ESPN integration, as we've already stated above, is top-notch. From the menus to the in-game graphics, to the wipes between replays, the added ESPN veneer adds the authenticity of a television broadcast, and it's well-rendered throughout.    Speaking of replays, they are somewhat of a mixed bag. While it's impressive how many and how varied they are, sometimes the auto replays get too far behind players and completely block any view of the puck. This usually happens on the second and third replay of a goal, but it is annoying nonetheless. As for user-controlled replays, these look great and really convey the amazing detail of the models and faces. However, there should be some way to save a replay for future viewing.     More camera options would also be nice. In addition to the camera choices, it would have been nice to have a zoom slider to tweak the distance to the ice. The default camera is the best, but it still doesn't drop far enough back, so cross-ice passes are sometimes a gamble. One slider could have fixed the camera problem completely.    But, again, these are minor gripes. This is an astounding visual game, and it manages to be pretty smooth throughout as well. Kudos to the graphics team.   Sound  We almost can't give enough praise to the sound in this game. From the best commentary ever to grace a hockey title, to swelling crowds, to vicious on-ice noises and awesome licensed music, ESPN NHL delivers the entire sound package.    Of course, it all begins with excellent and authentic booth work from the ESPN crew of Gary Thorne and Bill Clement. The game calling is probably the most proficient we've encountered in a hockey game. The announcer keeps the comments terse and rapid, and the track does a great job of staying in tune with the action. When replays and cutaways happen, the commentary switches to an impressive string of scene-specific remarks. The first few times you hear a play broken down in this fashion, it's quite amazing.     Prior to the game, the commentary is also great. Instead of saying, something generic, the announcers will say stuff like ~Mike Dunham is proud to represent his country as a goalie for the US national team.~ This is a level of commentary detail that isn't present in other games. Of course, the downside to non-generic commentary like this is that if you play a Franchise, you'll hear some of the same player-specific phrases over and over again. No commentary has ever been repetition-free, but this one draws attention to itself, partially because the comments are astute the first time you hear them.     The crowd sounds are also excellent. There seem to be many levels going on at once, and the crowds are quite intelligent. They'll boo referee non-calls, and if you're losing big late in the game, you'll hear that strange combination of cheering and booing that is present in such circumstances. In addition, crowds will actually chant team-specific things. For instance, when Nikolai Khabibulin made a huge save early in the game, the crowd starting hollering ~Bulin, Bulin, Bulin.~     There are also licensed songs that play during the breaks in the game. The most famous of these is Queen's ~We Will Rock You.~ It's not overused (seldom more than one 10-second clip per game), but it adds yet another layer of realism. The menu music, featuring the signature ESPN NHL songs we all know and love, add even more fun to the mix. Like the graphics department, this game nails sound dead-on. If you're reading this review, it's fairly likely that you're into hockey video games. Suffice it to say that you'll be plenty into this one. It's got everything a marquee sports title needs... except a more fleshed-out Franchise Mode. But we'll cut it some slack. After all, you'll be too busy making your own fun playing head-to-head, online and off. Again, SEGA's game delivers excitement, intensity and realism to the rink. Again, it's worthy of your well-earned dollars.", "date": "Sep 9, 2003"}
