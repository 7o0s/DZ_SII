The concept is sound - the original Destroy All Humans! put us in the moon boots of Crypto Sporidium 137, a Furon Scout (read: little grey alien in the Whitley Strieber tradition) - a being bent on probing humans and working his way into governmental positions of power across the globe.   And so it has come to pass that little grey aliens from outer space have landed on Earth. Government agencies don't generally appreciate illegal aliens - particularly ones whose technology is a massive leap beyond our capabilities. Pandemic has released the next title in the series, and it is clear that it set out to answer the main criticisms of the first. Destroy All Humans! 2 continues the well-written and often hilarious Grand Theft Auto-meets-Psychonauts gameplay, and refines the action and story progression.   Set ten years after the events of the previous game, the swinging sixties (1969 to be precise) provides Pandemic with plenty of off-colour material to draw from. Heck, there's a character called Bongwater in the very first area of the game - classy.   Crypto himself is a bit of a sleaze, with the Jack Nicholson impersonator doing a fine job of putting a greasy, intoxicant-induced spin on everything he says. Frankly, the voice acting is consistently entertaining, and goes some way towards compensating for the often bland environments and slightly wonky animations of pedestrians and crashing vehicles.   A host of alien energy weapons are at your disposal.  Being the vastly superior life form that he is, Crypto has two main methods of attack. Utilizing his latent psychokinetic abilities, Crypo can manipulate weak-minded humans, erase minds, toss cars and wreak mayhem. As was the case in the first title, these are necessary to complete missions - particularly using Crypto's bodysnatching ability to mingle with the unsuspecting public. Of course, things go awry if your time limit-based, fleshy disguise wears off in front of a crowd. The ability of influence moods and erase minds becomes an effective tool for crowd control.   The second method of maiming comes in the form of weapons and alien technology. The weapons from the first game return, with slightly improved characteristics. The Dislocator, a rifle that flings out purple discs of gravity-warping plasma, blast anything it collides with in random directions. Watching a hapless guard get flung by the legs into a building wall 30 metres down the road is immensely satisfying, if somewhat cruel.   Side-missions have been fleshed out this time around - by the end of the game, you'll have the KGB, the army, ninjas, cultists, hippies and a host of patriotic humans after you. Each race or affiliation generally offers specific side-stories that you can tackle or ignore at your leasure.   The Arkvoodle cult quest is particularly funny - you're vested the mission of warping the minds of cult members to worship you and your people as all-knowing alien gods. It births some fantastic dialogue and really highlights how far Pandemic has come from the fairly linear and repetitive missions in the original game.    Furotech cells are the new item-upgrade currency - a vast improvement over the original. These cells are scattered around the game's worlds and are also obtainable by completing various side-missions. Though the cells are handy for upping things like the height and duration of your jetpack's boost or the number of rounds in your weapons, they're not really necessary for progressing through the game. There's no need to spend ages backtracking for missed cells, unless you're some kind of anal completion freak. It also highlights a little quirk in the gameplay - without spoiling things, it's possible to max out some easily obtainable weapons fairly early into the story and thereby make the rest of the weapons feel a little moot.    The missions themselves range from 'get from point A to point B' and 'speak with X', to tricky escort tasks and all-out human slaughtering rampages. Herein lies another flaw. As in Grand Theft Auto, the more illegal activity you commit, the more heat you'll draw. After a good number of run-ins with the authorities, you'll have the National Guard and the army after you. Sounds a little extreme, right? Well, they definitely have the numbers advantage on you, but resetting the difficulty is ponderously easy - you merely need to phone in a fake 'all clear - we got him' order on one of a number of phone booths scattered around each city. As soon as you are off the phone, the ground force fades away, and assuming you can play it cool for a minute and keep out of mischief, they won't come back. It's just a little too easy to take advantage of this feature and it undercuts the difficulty considerably.   Anybody wearing a dressing gown that ugly needs a good zapping.  Similarly, dying while in the heat of a mission has very little consequence, since you respawn in pretty much the same position you croaked in and all your weapons and ammo are magically restored. It's almost an incentive to throw the game on purpose mid-mission, just for the bonus refuel.   Both the PS2 and Xbox versions of the game feature co-operative play - you and a mate can tackle the main storyline in split-screen. However, playing in this mode severely hampers the framerate and draw distance - not to the point of being unplayable, but the engine definitely chugs and chokes when more than a handful of characters enter your field of vision. Beyond this mode, there are also some off-beat 2-player minigames, including a wacky psychokinetic tennis.So we've established that difficulty is an issue, as it was in the original; it's not always a cakewalk, but you won't really struggle to progress through the storyline. Thankfully, Destroy All Humans! 2 provides enough variety and a quirky cast of characters to make it a worthwhile purchase for fans of the first and for gamers with a taste for the distinctly original.Click here to see how the US felt after having a good probe with DOH2.", "date": "Oct 20, 2006"}
