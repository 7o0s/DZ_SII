Not only are there two NASCAR titles to play with the Xbox during the launch cycle, but both will probably garner some healthy sales and rentals due to the fact that yes, nearly all of America wants to feel the ultimate burn of the Indy 500.  If you live in Manhattan you may not understand it, but no matter -- this isn't for you. While Thunder delivered a more player-friendly experience, NASCAR Heat from Infogrames tries to deliver a simulation level of detail, while still offering some cool modes to teach you the tricks of the trade. Will all racing fans enjoy this? Definitely not. But those of you with a hunger for the sport will have fun with this title, despite a few technical setbacks. Since this is a game built on technicalities they may urk you, but even still, turning left has never looked so good.  Gameplay NASCAR Heat gives you the full range of experiences, from bite-sized challenges and single races to a full championship mode, not to mention the ability to tweak your car to the infinite degree. We're definitely talking sim here, more than games like Project Gotham that give you realistic controls, but keep details like tweaking the front sway bar far from gamers.  The most hyped up mode of the bunch is Beat the Heat, NASCAR Heat's scenario game, where you're given a set of tasks to complete, like hitting a curve in a certain time, or passing a certain number of players. While they're pretty simplistic at first, they're great for anyone trying to figure out how NASCAR works on the track, and ramp up in difficulty as you get farther along. There's a lot of filler, but get to some of the more elaborate tasks and you'll find yourself challenged, particularly if you want to snag the gold.  The Race the Pro mode is built for the perfectionist in you. The tracks have been raced by actual pros, so as you'd expect, your chances of beating them are slim. If you're a casual gamer, this is going to have you gritting your teeth when you make the slightest of errors on a turn, and find yourself forever staring at the bumper of your favorite driver. Those of you that are trying to perfect your technique will devote the hours needed to master this mode.  The real meat of the game comes in the normal races where you'll get the AI working its magic. Looking for clean spots, drafting behind you, trying to work around your (usually) erratic driving behavior. It's hard to have realistic cars react around a somewhat unrealistic videogame player, but for the most part Heat manages to pull it off. Even when you're trying to hit cars, or slam on your brakes in front of them to catch a gleeful crash, you'll find that they're always quick to react to your moves without seeming mechanical. It's fun to watch, especially in replay.   The most exciting feature of NASCAR Heat lies in its reproduction of a full 43 car field, giving you some real competition on the raceway. This comes with some framerate issues, unfortunately, but the additional cars definitely give the game more realism than ever. It's hard to promote yourself as a simulation when you don't have a full team on the playing field, and with Heat and Thunder, now complete games can finally be played on the oval of competition.  Along with the framerate stutter comes the car stutter as well, in the form of some very touchy controls. You've got a great analog stick in the Xbox controller, but you wouldn't know it from the way your car jitters around the track in this game. The slightest touch will have the car altering its course in surprising ways, especially considering some of the realism in other aspects of the game. Just watch the replay of your car on easier skill levels, and you'll groan at the odd way the car shakes its way across the track. Other finicky problems come with some of the easier damage models in the game -- sure it's nice to have your car be a little less touchy, but when you can slam into walls and cars at full speed, flip sideways, then magically flip back down again, it's a little disconcerting.  In most of the modes, you can get away with tapping your opponents as they pass, sending them spinning, without a penalty. In the Beat the Heat mode in particular, you can play dirty to get the gold and never feel a twinge of guilt. The crash model is also another factor -- in most time-based goals in Beat the Heat, you can win them easier by just gunning it and slamming up against the wall than by trying to actually race out the perfect line. There has to be some middle ground somewhere, but it's hard to be found in all of the tweaks of Heat. If you're good enough to take off some of the help you'll find yourself with a more rounded experience, but less experienced gamers may find themselves more frustrated with the way the game makes the controls easier, rather than happier.  Graphics You've got to work hard to make an oval track consistently look fantastic, and for the most part, NASCAR Heat succeeds. Bump mapped details like the grass, and added extras like worn tracks make the environments very true to life. The car interiors feature some cool lighting effects through the bars, as do reflections from the high gates around the track. Unfortunately, other details are oddly lacking, like a damage model that is far from realistic, and undersides of the cars that are lacking in any detail at all. The lighting on the levels tends to be on the bright side, so you'll also feel like the game misses an added oomph to the shadowing of other games. Overall, however, NASCAR Heat delivers some nice car models, some great texture detail (especially on the cars), and a nice NASCAR-friendly presentation screen filled with tons of custom video.  Sound The commentary from real racers and announcers is great, especially if you're a fan of the sport. Sure it can sound a little stilted at times, but overall it's a welcome addition to racing. Hearing your crew screaming ~go go go go go!~ into your mic, or giving you a heads up on a car on your tail is done perfectly. Engine sounds are adequate, but unfortunately the braking sounds very one-note, and rarely ever reacts in detail to the way that you're braking, or the speed at which you brake. When more arcade type racers are starting to make your engine and brake system a much more dynamic soundscape, then surely the simulation titles must follow. In this regard, NASCAR Heat still lacks the extra punch needed to get your ears interested on the track, especially since there isn't music to hide the details. If you're a diehard fans of both NASCAR and simulations, then you'll find NASCAR Heat to give you a great racing experience, with the ability to tweak your car, customize your race, or play a full competitive mode at your leisure. The Beat the Heat and Race the Pro modes give you a little extra, and multiplayer can fill in some idle time with some friends. Overall however, the game doesn't deliver enough of a broad experience to give less than sim racers the road experience they're probably looking for.", "date": "Dec 6, 2001"}
