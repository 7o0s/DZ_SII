Ever. Aggressive Inline is everything that the respectable Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 promised to be, and everything it should have been, and it makes inline skating look like the kick-ass, mind-numbingly radical sport it truly is in real life. And what's cool about Aggressive Inline is that it doesn't feel like Dave Mirra one bit. Aggressive Inline takes the formula made popular by NeverSoft (and not so coincidentally, Z-Axis) and puts it to the metal, creating a phenomenally huge, compelling skating game that boasts the largest levels ever seen in a game of its kind. It offers a brisk 60 fps framerate, perfect controls, and a wacky sophomoric humor that sticks. And it's the first inline skating game on the system with a particular feel all its own. To date, Aggressive Inline stands as one of the most unique, innovative, and upstanding extreme sports games on PlayStation 2. The BasicsHaving toiled with Dave Mirra for years now, the Hayward, Ca.-based developer Z-Axis has created a game that answers all of the right questions and delivers everything this kind of game should. I'm quite sure Aggressive Inline won't revolutionize the industry like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater did years ago, but it's upped the level of gameplay, graphics, and size, and style in one shiny, tight package that's impossible to deny and that's hard to match.Well, so who cares about inline skating? If you don't now, you may soon. Using inline skates in place of a BMX bike or a skateboard, Aggressive Inline enables players to pull off all of the radical tricks and stunts you're used to in Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 or Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, but skewed into an inline skating form, using terms such as Cess Slide, for instance, instead of fakie, and adding in entirely new moves no other game has (such as Vaulting). In fact, Aggressive Inline re-creates in videogame form an arcade experience quite unlike any before it.   It's a very complete package. The game stars 10 pro inline skaters, features seven gigantic levels (plus a very detailed tutorial level), a powerful park editor, a freeskate mode, a split-screen mode for two players to vie, and a solid soundtrack. The inline skater list features Shane Yost, Taig Khris, Franky Morakes, Matt Lindenmuth, Chris Edwards, Sven Boekhorst, Jaren Grob, Matt Salerno, Eito Yasuko, and Sam Fogarty. It also features original fictional characters, many of whom are female, enticing, and revealing. You like tight girly underwear and breast physics? You got it. With exrteme sports, players want several basic things to be handled perfectly so that the game enables them to simply play, unrestrained from technical annoyances. Aggressive Inline delivers. Ninety-nine percent of the time, the framerate runs at a crisp, smooth 60 fps. The control is easy to learn, using both the Tony Hawk controls plus setups for Mirra fans, and the response time to the characters is lightning quick. The game is so responsive you'll never once think of blaming them for a bail. The seven-plus levels are not only large in terms of square footage, but they're also high, like three to four stories high. Players will find that the interactive environments offer an enormous landscape twice the polygon count of Dave Mirra 2, but with none of the slowdown, no seeable chugs or clipping problems, and an incredibly fast pace. Perhaps the biggest and most noticeable aspect of the game's design is its offering of an immense set of lines that permeate every single level like few games before it. What I really like about it is that while Aggressive Inline borrows gameplay ideas from others, it's also full of originality with moves such as vaulting. It also delivers a smattering of fantastically interactive levels, all wrapped up in funny, outlandish settings.   GameplaySeparating itself from the pack in several ways, Aggressive Inline boasts a unique progression system that enables players to move from level to level by earning points but without requiring them to finish that particular level. Challenges are set up with a point score attached to them, so you can pull off a 1-point challenge or a 3-point challenge, depending on your ability and ambition level. The meat of the game is Career mode, which, as you progress through, opens up levels that can be playable in Freeskate mode and elsewhere. So, you can finish 47% of the first level, for instance, but earn enough points to open up the next level. This grows harder in the later levels, encouraging players to return to previous ones to complete the earlier goals.What's quite subtle and dually impressive about this natural flowing setup is that as players complete specific challenges, they alter the landscape of the level permanently. In some cases the changes are as simple as lowering a statue sword, which creates a new challenge, while in other scenarios, such as in the Movie Lot, where a giant boulder falls to the ground, the landscape is more profoundly changed, also setting up new challenges. Gamers will watch time and time again as a cinematic cutscene demonstrates how the levels change and what the new challenge is. Z-Axis has peppered the levels with out-of-this-world changes and silly, cartoon-like alterations that will surprise and entertain you. They did us. The move set is familiar and yet new. The game sets up players with a grind/handplant (Triangle), Cess Slide (R2), grab (Square), flip/spin (Circle), modifiable moves, wall rides, four variations of the manual, special tricks, vaulting, skitching, pole spins, and more. While pole spinning has been seen before (Air Blade), and skitching (Jet Set Radio) and reverts (Tony Hawk) have also been seen, they have been incorporated seamlessly into Aggressive Inline and customized for inline skating. To my knowledge vaulting is entirely new to extreme sports, and it's a nice little extra that works in well with other moves.  Players are given an excellent tutorial to learn and to start mastering the moves, and the training is complete with clear explanations of what each new move means and does.   I found that I was totally involved in the very basic moves, which is both good and bad. As I have been saying, Z-Axis has completely gone back to the drawing board with Aggressive Inline. The team constructed a game in which players enhance their player characteristics by performing one particular move more than others. So, for instance, if you perform more wall rides and grinds than other moves, your character points, which are earned throughout the game, will show high marks for wall riding and grinds, while others remain rather bare, such as say, speed and tricks.The idea is to level up your skater so that all areas are high in points, since the higher you raise their points, the faster and more skilled you will become. It's like a customizable RPG that way. There are seven characteristics altogether, jump, speed, spin, grind, manual, fakie, and wallride. In my case, I upgraded everything except for wallrides and spins, so I returned to familiar levels to improve my characteristics.The other profound aspect to the game is the sheer immensity of the levels. They are simply monstrous. There is no other way to describe it. Players will kind of skate around looking at things, thinking ~Hey, this is pretty big,~ and they'll perhaps accidentally open a door that leads to an entirely new section of the level that's as big or even bigger than the section they were just in. Your jaw will drop, and that will simply be the first of several times it will occur. Each level ranges in story size, too, so players can jump up to ramps or half pipes three or four stories high. It's insane.    But that's not the half of it. Scattered throughout each level are floating keys sitting in front of doors. There are as many as five doors per level. Behind each one is a hidden landscape that ranges in size. So, not only are there changing landscapes that offer new challenges (which was done in Tony Hawk 3, yes, I remember), but once you find keys to said places, the unlocked doors provide environments that can be as large as twice the size of the immediate level you're in. The Museum level and the Boardwalk present unbelievably huge sections that dwarf the levels in this game and, for that matter, any other game of the sort. This too, was done in Tony Hawk 2, but never to this level nor to this magnitude. The last and perhaps most important aspect to Aggressive Inline is the level design. With such large levels, you'd think that there may be a lot of vacant space in which to just fiddle. Or that there would be wasted space. No. These gigantic levels are packed with objects, structures, and moving backgrounds. There is so much stuff in these levels that this game will become a serious problem for any parent with an Attention Defecit Disorder kid. The level of distraction is so big, it's scary, and that's coming from a regular (non-A.D.D.) kid such as myself.And still, I haven't even targeted one of the most important points lying behind the excellent design. This game isn't only big, it's not just high, it's not just packed with dozens and dozens of challenges, and distracting moving parts, and funny interactive areas, and non-player characters, and hidden sections, and surprises, it's filled with lines, lines, and more lines. The immensity of the line structure is on par with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series (2 and 3, specifically), and given the size of the levels, I'd say Aggressive Inline surpasses both of those games with the number of lines to find, grind, and follow. The level design is far beyond anything Z-Axis has done before, no question, and I'd say it's perhaps far more intricate and layered than any game of its kind.   GraphicsZ-Axis appears to have nailed the graphics on this latest effort better than in any of its previous games. Using the idea of humongous environments that we first saw in Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2, Z-Axis has thus bumped up the framerate to 60, added a slew of colorful and varying textures, and then took a few extra steps above and beyond the call of duty, constructing several new components that, with the exception of SSX Tricky, visually blow Mirra and every other extreme game away altogether. To put a point on it, the game is not only massive, it's twice the polygon count of Mirra, which already was a technical feat. It's large and absolutely crammed with stuff. The Mirra levels were the biggest we've seen for an extreme game on PS2, and these often surpass those in size, outdoing them in other aspects as well. The PS2 is strong with the ability to push huge quantities of polygons simultaneously, and after much practice, Z-Axis has whipped Sony's bad-boy system into shape. The average level is, as I said before, gigantic, but it's also diverse, and architecturally, the game boasts a strong flair of creativity and zaniness that's never been reached before by Z-Axis.In my earlier preview I mentioned the strange balloon weirdness that awed the IGN staff. That's still very intriguing, no doubt. We all like snail and sea horse balloons, as phallic and bizarre as they might be. But then there's the Tuna Cannery Level, offering a pernicious sense of the absurd, with its special interactive features, and when you see the not-so-subliminal Tuna Kitchen message, it'll all become very clear how much fun Z-Axis had constructing these levels.What happens again and again as I roll the game's graphics through my head is not so much how I admire the textures (they're quite good), but how the colorful art direction is bolstered with an enormous amount of stuff. And it's not like the game shows predominantly boring or repetitive textures. Aggressive Inline is loaded with unique images, hundreds of very particular textures, and a great mix of light, color, and imagery. Each level is totally individualistic, and while some aren't as interesting to me as others, the best ones are spectacular. For instance, I liked the Movie Lot, Boardwalk, and Museum better than the Tuna Cannery, Industrial Plant or the Airfield, but all have something worth seeing.    When it comes to animation, these 10-plus characters exude style, flair, and even a little (OK, a lot of) personality. The healthy roster of pro inline skaters is complemented by a handful of original fictional characters, too. Each uses what Z-Axis calls ~dynamic cloth technology,~ which is a fancy-schmancy way of saying ~animations,~ but perhaps their term is at least more accurate. Each character wears clothes that most suit him or her, and to be sure, the X-Games' sense of sloppy, casual clothing is most definitely apparent here. So, whereas Jaren Grob wears his pants real low, showing off his boxers (perfectly re-created in the game), fictional Chrissy's school-girl miniskirt flies up showing her underpants every two seconds, and her upper portions move with a certain, shall we say, ~physics sensibility.~ The kind horny male gamers like, that is. I can appreciate it all, and I have to say it adds a certain nonchalance and perhaps even a little more color than most games would normally offer in that way (the first Dead or Alive being the exception). In any case, the animations are excellent, fluid, smooth, and pleasing to the eye.As for the rest, the other best parts of the graphics are featured in the reflective surfaces and in the particle system. The first level boasts a watery and reflective sheen underneath the stone surface, while transparent glass, windows, and other similar areas look great. The most noticeable part of the particle system is seen in the glowing gold that flies off your skates and the sparks that fly off when you're grinding. The only complaints in the graphics area fall into the normal PS2 category, meaning that you'll often see flicker and a few aliasing problems, the latter of which there are very few. And, for the PS2 owner, well, you know it's going to happen, so it's just a matter of how badly it will show up. Here, it's not bad.SoundIf you enjoyed the music from Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2, then youll like this, too. It's not quite as good in my opinion, and it didn't capture my sense of pop music, but its listenable. The same general sense of musical tastes has been implemented here, consisting of a mix that ranges from current pop FM radio stuff to more hardcore rock to alternative tastes, to a little hip hop. The full song list includes ~Wrong Way,~ by Sublime, ~Monday Morning~ and ~Falling For You,~ by Student Rick, ~I'm A Cloud~ by Boy Hits Car, ~Passing Me By~ by Pharcyde, ~Sell Out,~ by Reel Big Fish, ~Crawling In The Dark,~ by Hoobastank, ~Idea for A Movie,~ by The Vandals, ~Song # 13,~ by The Ataris, ~The Choice Is Yours,~ by Black Sheep, ~Your Disease,~ by Saliva, and ~Don't Sweat The Technique,~ by Eric B & Rakim.An excellent function not found in Mirra but nicely secured here is the ability to switch songs in the menu system during the midst of a level. From the menu screen, the whole soundtrack is available to pick and choose from, so you can select the whole set, or choose the few (or even the one) you like and head them (or it) over and over.  You can also choose not to listen if you?re a real grump. There is no ripping here, but I suspect for the Xbox version there certainly will be.While Tony Hawk and SSX have ruled the PlayStation 2 roost, the time has come for a new challenger, and Aggressive Inline is ripped, buffed, and ready for the fight. Aggressive Inline is deep, layered, and dense with stuff to do, and it's backed up with an enormously thick network of lines on which to shred. The control is top notch and the animations also come in with flying colors. To be honest, there isn't much to complain about in Aggressive Inline. The fact is, it's an impressive, enormous game that's as good as anything else out there in the extreme sports genre, which is the most surprising thing there is to say. Though it shouldn't be. I've been following Z-Axis for some time now, ever since Thrasher: Skate or Die, and the company's efforts all seem to have culminated in this nearly perfect effort. You don't want to miss Aggressive Inline, it's just that good.", "date": "May 29, 2002"}
