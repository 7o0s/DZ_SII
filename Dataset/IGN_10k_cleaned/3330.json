No one in your family has seen the blue skies and pristine mountains of Dereth since.  That is until now.  Today, you and your brothers and sisters can return to the fresh air, as the threat that forced your people underground has lessened.  As you emerge into the bright sunlight, you will be able to choose many paths to help rebuild society and make it safe to live in.  Will you heed this second call?   Asheron's Call 2: Fallen Kings is the latest massively multiplayer online role-playing game to be released.  This 2nd generation MMORPG by the development team at Turbine Entertainment is set in the fantasy realm, where magic is real and beasts roam freely.  Having one successful persistent state world under their belts, they have completely upgraded Dereth with a stunning new 3D engine.  While it is called Asheron's Call 2, there is very little to relate to the original game in this sequel as far as gameplay and mechanics are concerned.  However, the rich history of Dereth still exists and players of the original will find some links to it.   Fallen Kings is perhaps the most new player friendly game on the market.  Even if you have never played an MMORPG before, this one immediately immerses you into the game.  It has a great tutorial that walks you through the important parts of the interface and mechanics.  After exiting into Dereth, you are greeted with many quests and choices to further the learning experience.  Before you know it, you are level 8 and have not only completed all the new player quests, but are a pro at the interface and already in love with this incredible looking world.   Character creation is straight forward and removes the hardest choice players usually have to make when they first start out, which is the path they want their character to take.  Instead, creating your alter ego involves only choosing a race, gender, appearance and name.  There are three races to choose from, Human, Lugian and Tumerok.  Each race has its own skill trees to choose from, so which race you choose will affect which path you can follow in game. All three do allow you to choose to be a melee, missile or magic user, but the available skills will vary.  The wily, spiritual Tumeroks are considered to be the best magic users, the hulking, strong Lugians to exceed at melee attacks and the humans to be best in missile, namely archery.  However, no matter which race you choose, you can easily pick any attack style you want and be successful.   Perhaps one of the most interesting things about Fallen Kings is its Vault Quests.  These are dungeons which you enter with glyphs, a key of sorts that drops on certain monsters or that you receive after completing a quest.  The dungeons are relatively short, although some of the higher level dungeons require finding a key that you retrieve from a creature's corpse.  At the end of each dungeon awaits a boss monster.  After defeating this monster, you can then enter the shard room which when clicked will play a movie and award you the experience points for completing the quest.  The movie is actually lore on the events that transpired over the course of the last few hundred years.  It's a wonderful reward and something that has not been seen before in a persistent state environment.  The vaults span every level and can only be completed once.   The Vaults are only one of the types of quests you can embark on.  There are many others, especially for the lower levels.  Some quests involve killing a certain type of monster, either to retrieve a trophy from its corpse or simply killing them to decrease the number in Dereth.  Others are tradeskill quests that will require crafting an item.  Several involve retrieving an item from a dangerous location, like the depths of a dungeon.  Often times, quests will involve all three of these types of activities.  Quests are logged and you can view information on current quests or see when finished quests can be repeated.  You can also view the cutscenes from the Vaults you have completed.  There is special animation and sound for every time you complete or advance a quest as well, a nice reward in itself.   Combat is relatively simple, although there are mechanics to it that can make it complicated.  You simply target a monster and press the attack button and you are off, hacking, firing or casting at the beast.  However, a unique component to combat has been added.  You can train special skills in each of the three forms of combat.  These special skills are attacks that can do a great deal of damage, especially if executed when a monster is glowing with a golden aura, indicating it is especially vulnerable.  For example, magic users can train fire and cold attacks and melee specialists can learn a skill that will ignore any armor the enemy has on.  Properly times, these assaults can mean the difference between life and vitae.   Vitae is the penalty you receive when you die.  Instead of losing experience, like in Everquest, or even having to do corpse recovery, which is an extremely common element of the older MOGs, you are given a vitae penalty, which reduces your health and vigor.  Vitae is simply lessened by earning experience you would receive anyway.  When you die, you are also transported back to the lifestone that was last attuned to.  Essentially, death is pretty painless.  They have removed some of the frustrating aspects of dying, like trying recover your items from your corpse which just happens to be sitting in the middle of 30 monsters or losing all the experience you've earned in a level (or since you last bought insurance).   The crafting system is pretty interesting, although I can see it becoming extremely complicated as you move up through crafting levels.  First, almost every item in the game, with the exception of crafted items, has resource ratings associated with it.  There are five common and five uncommon resources.  Common resources, like iron and wood, are found in normal loot or raw forms can be obtained from resource spots, like mines or logging camps.  Uncommon resources, like Silver and Elariwood, are found in rarer items.  Sometimes you will also get lucky enough to obtain some from a raw resource spot.  Each recipe in your craft book requires certain resources with a respective rating.  For example, to make the first level of human gloves, you will need to have an item or a bar of iron with an iron rating of at least 15.  As you move up the crafting tree, the recipes get increasingly complicated, requiring more and rarer resources with higher ratings, gold and monster trophies.  With each attempt at crafting, there is a chance of failure.  This chance is decreased by mastering a recipe, by using crafting tools and by crafting near buildings in towns like forges and smithing workshops.  Each time you master a recipe, a new recipe is learned.  According to the developers, the best items in game will come from crafters.   As you progress through the game, killing monsters and solving quests, you will gain levels and earn experience points.  At each level, you earn a skill credit.  These credits are used to learn skills.  Some require only one credit to train, others require more.  You can train in any of the three attack trees or the special skills tree, which contains the transportation and kingdom related skills.  In each tree, there are specialist skills which you can choose upon reaching a certain level.  For example, if you train a human in melee attacks, upon hitting level 13 you can further specialize by choosing to be a bounty hunter or a defender and opening up those new skill trees.  At any point you can untrain skills as well, making no choice permanent.  This prevents players from making a character that will be ~gimped~ at later levels without realizing it and having to start from scratch with a new character.  Also, skills are raised using experience points.  The more points put into a skill, the better you will be with that skill.  Putting experience points into a healing skill will increase the number of health points per heal.      The interface is relatively easy to understand.  There is a convenient radar that gives your coordinates and shows anything in your area with a nice color coding system.  Monsters that show up on the radar as red, for example, are higher level than you, while portals show up on the radar as purple dots.  There are bars indicating Health and Vigor, which is used when utilizing skills or swimming.  The map shows many points of interests, quests, portals and towns, as well as your current location and is dynamic.  However, scrolling on the map can sometimes be frustrating as it scrolls in landblocks.  You have several hotkey bars, which you can use to drag skills, weapons and crafting recipes to.  The inventory is a little clunky as there is no way to sort items and there are no packs to help differentiate items.  It is really easy to accidentally put on a piece of armor or equip a weapon and then convert the items you really want into gold or use in a recipe.  Gold, a valuable resource in crafting, is gained by dragging items from your inventory into the money bag.  This replaces running to town and selling loot to NPC's as there are no NPC vendors.  The chat bars are nice because you have four possible chat windows and different kinds of chat can be filtered into the different windows or turned off, but I found this confusing as well, having to scroll through several windows if I wanted to use them.  Overall, I still see enhancements that can be made to the interface.  The nice thing about Turbine is they are always improving the experience.   This brings me to the real meat of this game.  Every month, a new event is unleashed.  With the event comes a patch full of new monsters, quests, features, bug fixes and improvements.  Episode 1: Emergence was unfolded just a couple days ago.  This patch changed a lot of the dynamics of the game and the interface.  They improved the new player training and introduced many low level quests.  They also changed the chat interface.  It was all one color before and now there are many colors that can be customized to your preference.  Patch day was much anticipated in Asheron's Call, and it is expected to be the same in this sequel.  In a year, the game will likely look nothing like it does today and that is really where this game succeeds.  It is exciting to log in after the patch and see all the modifications to the world, especially seasonal changes.  Already, this first patch introduced a ton of content.  Next months patch is expected to do the same, bringing in some much desired high level activities which appear to be lacking at this time.   As has been stated many a time, the graphics are just incredible.  Even on low settings, everything about this game screams eye candy.  For computers that can handle the high settings, it is a feast for the synaptic senses.  Incredible landscapes and sunrises will greet you as you journey through the game.  The creature models are extremely detailed, and even the ones that are eyesores are amazing to look at.  You can see your reflection, or the reflection of other objects, in the water and it ripples realistically.  The only thing that is disappointing with the graphics are the character models.  More choices would have been great and being able to customize the avatars like is possible in Asheron's Call or Earth & Beyond would have added something to personalizing the experience.  Even with this lacking, everything else about the graphics is perfect and maybe even a little beyond.  The graphics far exceed any other online game on the market.   It is also obvious that a lot of work was put into the sound effects and music.  Each area of the game has its own unique musical score and sound effects.  As I entered one particularly creepy area of the game, I was greeted to owls hooting, wind screaming and an eerie musical track that put me on edge.  Music is extremely dynamic, changing according to what you are doing in the game and how many monsters are in the vicinity.  One of the most intriguing features is the player created music.  At any time, you can pick up an instrument and use one of the several musical emotes to start playing it.  If you don't have an instrument, you can sing instead.  Get together with several of your friends to make a symphony or just start playing in town and others might join in.  The music and sound effects are definitely impressive.    What did you think of Asheron's Call 2? Getting together is also encouraged in this game.  There are three forms of grouping built into the game.  Fellowships are short term and allow player to share experience and loot.  This is a great feature for someone who wants to be a healer or support character.  An advantage to fellowships is that many quests are made much easier.  No more is there standing around waiting for everyone in your group to kill the boss monster in order to get that critical monster trophy.  Instead, often times only one member of the quest must be credited with a kill for the entire fellowship to move on to the next step.  Allegiances are permanent affiliations, although you can break allegiance.  Based on the feudal system, players swear allegiance to each other, essentially making them patron and vassal.  The person at the top of the chain who isn't sworn to anyone is the monarch.  Patrons benefit by gaining experience from their vassals, up to a percentage needed for each level.  Unlike Asheron's Call, which created experience chains with some people even going so far with them they actually paid others to earn them experience, only a percentage of each level can be gained.  The rest must be earned yourself.  The final form of grouping is Kingdoms.  There are three kingdoms, each  with its own tenets and philosophies.  Players can join one of the kingdoms, the Order of Dereth, the Shadow Kingdom and the Dominion, and can switch kingdoms or become neutral again whenever they would like.  Joining one opens up access to special skills and there are Player versus Player consequences, although you aren't forced to participate in this.  There are servers for players who want that full Kingdom experience as well as a full Player versus Player world where everyone is vulnerable.   There are some glaring absences from the game.  There is no permanent storage or housing, something that was added very late in the game in Asheron's Call.  Perhaps it is intended to be added at a later date, since players are currently charged with rebuilding the world.  Also, there is no ability to tie to a portal.  I'm not really sure why this was omitted.  It makes portal summon and recall a relatively useless skill, and instead the choice of a lifestone location becomes more important.  Soloing is pretty hard to do, as well, although some classes have more success that others.  It would have been nice if Turbine had added some kind of system to help players find groups, like Anarchy Online has.  It is by no means a perfect game, but the fact that there are changes made every month suggests that in a few months, these problems and many others can be eliminated.The most important question you might be asking is, is Fallen Kings fun?  I have to say a resounding yes!  If you've never played a MOG before, this is a great one to introduce you to the genre.  If you enjoy questing, lore or role-playing, you will probably love this game.  In fact, if you are anything but a power-leveling addict who wants to be the first to reach level cap by constantly hunting monsters, this is the experience for you.  However if riding that level treadmill is what you live for, this will most likely not appeal to you in its current state.  What awaits everyone in Dereth is a world rich with lore, quests and beauty.  Monthly updates indicates that Asheron's Call 2: Fallen Kings will only get better.", "date": "Dec 13, 2002"}
