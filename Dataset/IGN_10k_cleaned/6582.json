I simply must applaud MFORMA's foresight in signing Rovio's Darkest Fear, a survival-horror game for handsets that manages to step around the potential limitations of the platform and deliver an experience that is both creepy and bracingly original for mobile. It adheres to a few genre conventions, such as puzzle-solving with crates and keys, but it succeeds in delivering atmosphere that makes you come back for more and more.   Darkest Fear spins a solid yarn, detailing a hero's descent into a hospital that had been gripped by madness. Darkness has enveloped the facility, turning the majority of patients into rapacious monsters that feed on the living. Those that survived the ~event,~ must cling to any silver of light to avoid any bloody fate. And for you to make it through the hospital and rescue the survivors, you too must adhere to whatever pockets of light you can find, because stepping foot into the creeping blackness is downright hazardous to your health. As you fumble through the dark, creatures of indeterminate origin reach out and claw at your savory flesh.   The need to avoid the darkness is a major game play element, and one that a horror fan like me can really get behind. Each floor of this sprawling hospital is full of dark chambers that contain the secrets to getting out alive. The key is to discover and activate any available light source. Throwing open curtain allows some ambient light to fill rooms. Starting fireplaces (yeah, this is a hospital, just go with it) and firing up lanterns also pushes back the dark. The most coveted light source, though, is the flashlight. These beacons can be carried around, throwing light across rooms to clear a safe path to the next door. Flashlights can also be positioned on the floor to create stationary sources while you go about other business. Now, not every room will offer a chance for illumination. Sometimes you just have to dash through the darkness in hopes of hitting the next pool of light before your health supply is completely depleted.   To restock your health, you must find and rescue patients. Each saved patient offers you an extra health point on the next floor. These are extremely precious commodities, so it is worth the effort to seek them out. At first, I usually just saved one patient and then moved on, but after getting dropped in the shadows a few times, I made it a point to be Dudley Do-Right at every available opportunity.   Many puzzles involve balancing your pursuit of light with box-moving puzzles. The hospital has a slew of pressure switches on the ground that open doors elsewhere in the facility, and you must position crates on top of the boxes to keep them active. At first, this just requires some trial-and-error in the dark, but later on you cannot afford to blindly hope you hit the mark. You have to illuminate what you can, figure out the most direct path to get to the switch, and get out before the darkness does you in. There are also keys hidden in cabinets and drawers that must be uncovered. As you advance through the hospital, these become harder and harder to solve, because there is backtracking that must be done through the darkness. Surviving the runs through the darkness is truly exciting -- and that's saying a lot for a mobile game.   Rovio has a talent for presentation. The in-game action itself looks good, with the dark hospital slowly being illuminated as you go from room to room. When you encounter patients and people that can help your journey, the game puts of some very slick cutscenes. These are black-and-white affairs, bathed in shadow, and looking like the best of film noir. Beautiful touch. Darkest Fear is accompanied by a slight soundtrack. And my saying ~slight~ is hardly an insult. The soundtrack is just never overwhelming -- it serves the on-screen action to heighten tension when things get a little hairy, which is often. The whole thing just drips with mood, and it shows that if you really put out the effort, you can create a heavily atmospheric mobile game.  Darkest Fear is an excellent piece of entertainment. It's enormously gratifying to see the horror genre represented by two solid games in the last few months, Darkest Fear and Centerscore's Alone. Darkest Fear's use of light as savior is an excellent game mechanic, one that lends itself not only to smart puzzles, but also to some genuine creepy moments. Played at the airport on on the bus, Darkest Fear is still a good action-puzzle game, but it loses its mood. I pulled the curtains when playing Darkest Fear yesterday and today because I really wanted to emphasize the atmosphere -- and it worked. I think this is one of those games that will help more traditional gamers get interested in mobile gaming. Highly recommended.", "date": "Jan 30, 2006"}
