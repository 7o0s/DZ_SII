Yes, the expansion to last year's Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars packs a fair amount of new content. At its heart is a 13-mission single-player campaign, along with six new subfactions and a slick new global conquest campaign. Despite this, it feels eerily familiar. Kane's Wrath doesn't just feel like you're playing Tiberium Wars again, but the nagging feeling that also haunted C&C 3 returns. Replace the 3D looks with 2D graphics and swap the high-res HD video with lower-quality video and the gameplay is virtually indistinguishable from its original progenitor of more than 15 years ago.   Kane's Wrath hews closely to the standards of the series. There are fast, brutal real-time strategy battles that are intercut with live-action cinematics and cutscenes. Joe Kucan reprises his famous role as Kane, leader of the evil Brotherhood of Nod. Since this is an expansion, the rest of the cast isn't as large or as varied as it was in Tiberium Wars, but it's still pretty respectable with the additions of sci-fi veterans like Carl Lumbly and Natasha Henstridge. They play lieutenants of Kane who each have their own agenda.    The single-player campaign feels disjointed, mainly because it jumps all over the Command & Conquer timeline to fill in the gaps. Things start off just at the end of the Second Tiberium War, and every few missions the campaign leaps forward a decade or two. As such, you don't get much of a cohesive story. Instead, you get glimpses of the back story. While prior knowledge of the previous games isn't necessary, it would certainly be helpful in understanding what's going on.   Meanwhile, there's the standard selection of RTS mission styles in the campaign. Most of them have you begin with a construction unit, which you use to construct a base. That includes a refinery or two to start harvesting tiberium, some power generators, and a variety of infantry or vehicle factories, along with support buildings that unlock special powers and abilities. The formula in these is usually build up your forces till you're strong enough to go on offense, and then attack and repeat until you've worn down the enemy. Then there are a handful of non-building missions, where you control a small group of units and must navigate around the level without losing too many of them. Here the trick is to save early and often until you get through the level.    The entire campaign takes place from the perspective of the Brothehood of Nod, so you don't get to play as the Global Defense Initiative or the alien Scrin. Those are reserved either for skirmish, multiplayer, or the global conquest game. You do get to mess around with the two new Nod subfactions, the Marked of Kane and the Black Hand. The idea behind the subfactions is to inject some variety into the mix, though the differences between them seem a bit too subtle and slight. There's a bit more variety between the Scrin subfactions, as one of them plays entirely unlike anything else due to its dependence on mind control.   The battles are fun, especially when you're finally bulldozing an opponent over. After all, there's always something thrilling about stomping all over a foe. The lack of growth in the series is noticeable though, especially when things like AI and pathfinding are basically unchanged from the original C&C. Units can jam up on little obstacles, while the AI will send a steady stream of units at you regardless at how effective that tactic is. Things like that are especially glaring considering the features found in modern RTS games, such as intelligent squads that know how to use cover effectively on their own. As a result, the combat in Kane's Wrath feels like pure math; instead of tactics or maneuvering, the only thing that matters is how much damage your units can inflict per second.   It isn't until you hit the global conquest campaign mode that you encounter something very new and different for the series. This is basically an overarching strategic layer to tie real-time battles together, but unlike the campaign modes found in earlier EALA real-time strategy games, the one in Kane's Wrath does away with the idea of distinct provinces or territories. Instead, the global map allows for very fluid battle lines as factions struggle to carve out territory or corrupt cities and so on.    Multiplayer remains extremely fast-paced and fun; though depending on the skill of your opponent you might get wiped in minutes. Still, we managed to get in some nail-biting tug-of-war struggles. The addition of new superunits certainly helps to break the stalemates that occur, and it's cool to see a massive tank or insect-like war machine rampaging on the battlefield.Ultimately, Kane's Wrath is something that old school RTS fans and die-hard C&C veterans will enjoy. There's enough here to keep them busy for a long time. Those looking for a more modern RTS experience should look elsewhere, though.", "date": "Mar 25, 2008"}
