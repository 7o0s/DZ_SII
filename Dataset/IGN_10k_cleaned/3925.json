Some gamers may be tempted to shrug this project off as too simple -- to ~kiddie~ -- to warrant a look. True enough, Hatcher's lighthearted theme and easy-to-learn play mechanics will appeal to a younger demographic more than any other. But those who investigate this game deeper will discover that beneath its chicken suits and fluffy animals it has some satisfying challenges, a decent measure of depth, and a very fun multiplayer mode.   The Facts  A new 3D platformer from the maker of Sonic the Hedgehog Play as Billy Hatcher or three other characters Restore light to a vast world blanketed in darkness Dawn a rooster suit, roll eggs, and use them to beat enemies and solve puzzles Hatch eggs and unleash special abilities that can be used against foes Four-player battle mode with three unique gameplay types Runs in progressive scan mode Supports Dolby Pro Logic II   Gameplay Morning Land has mysteriously gone black. A darkness has swept over the fantastical location, which is the realm of the great Chicken Elders. This evil deed can only be the work of the Dark Raven, the King of the Crows, an evil force hell bent on turning the entire world -- well, dark. And so we have the concept powering Sega's latest GameCube offering. Not much, but it beats saving the princess again, no? Players assume the role of a regular human named -- conveniently enough -- Billy Hatcher. The boy wonder is one day contacted by the last still-safe Chicken Elders and led to a legendary Rooster Suit that gives him the power to control and -- yes, hatch eggs, which in turn grant him access to special abilities and powerful creatures. The game revolves around these eggs and how they might be used to solve puzzles and roll down enemies.   Hatcher is manipulated precisely with the analog stick. Moving the odd character around the cheery levels is moderately intuitive. When he's not rolling an egg, he has few options: he can run, he can hang from ledges, he can jump and he can try to hatch one of the ovals. The setup is very simple, easy, but also highly incomplete. In fact, Billy is almost worthless without his eggs. Luckily, eggs are in abundance and in a variety of different colors -- all of them deliver a different ability or prize.   It's in controlling and using the eggs that a welcomed, enjoyable layer of depth is added to the game. The simple process of rolling the oval-shaped objects to and from is fun because Sonic Team has implemented a believable physics system for them; they wobble, they careen off walls, they crack under the right circumstances, and yes, they'll even break open with a satisfying pop. This is not to suggest that movement of eggs is entirely realistic, though. Hatcher can bounce them to gain height. He can charge forward at enemies with them. They can be yo-yoed outward at foes. They can blast through walls and rocks, smash through crates, and unearth secrets hidden behind or underneath. Players will have to do all of the above in just about every level and all of these moves for the most part feel just right and are entertaining to perform. There are some unfortunate interferences, however: first, Hatcher can sometimes too easily lose control of his egg at which point players will have to double back for it. Second, the camera system -- always a problem in Sonic Team 3D games -- can and does occasionally get in the way.  Some challenges are definitely more rewarding than others. Hatching creatures, a reoccurring objective in the game, is often integrated with puzzle-solving and can be very satisfying. For example, Hatcher may come to a switch shrouded in fire, so he'll have to find, feed, grow, and then hatch a blue water egg, which will in turn give birth to a creature that can spray the liquid onto the flame and distinguish it. There are several different types of eggs, each with different creatures. Other puzzles make less sense. A doorway may remain locked, for example, for no reason. After searching for a traditional switch and trying to hatch all sorts of eggs, players will eventually discover that all they need to do is beat all of the enemies in the level and it will open. There may be no hints or guidance to illustrate this objective so we -- like Morning Land -- are left in the dark, which is discouraging.  Though the worlds in Billy Hatcher are varied, the goal is always more or less the same: to find the right egg, hatch it and proceed. That's not to suggest that nothing else happens. Hatcher will use the eggs to roll across floating coaster trails, to zoom through rings, to trampoline up levels of platforms, to defeat bosses, and more, for instance, and all of these actions are fun. It's just that we've seen all of this before. In fact, much of it has been done in Sonic Team's hedgehog-based offerings. Eventually the repetition of it all will still sink in and this may turn some more discriminating adult players off. Younger gamers, however, aren't likely to mind.    Billy Hatcher's multiplayer mode shouldn't be shrugged off as an extra. It's not. We, as a matter of fact, have enjoyed it more than the single-player experience. In it, up to four players compete across a wide variety of multi-tier arenas in several different games that range from trying to hatch the most eggs in a given time to a quasi-deathmatch mode in which gamers try to grow their eggs and then roll them over each other. The two-player mode is fun. The four-player one is excellent. Control remains true, fluidity smooth, and the egg-hatching play mechanics seem the perfect match for multiplayer mayhem. We can almost guarantee that players who give the mode a try will find themselves laughing and shouting at one another as their character's egg goes off a cliff or is snatched up by the opposition.     Graphics There is a certain look that has attached itself to the last several Sonic Team-developed games. Billy Hatcher has it. This is both good and bad. The style of the game itself is not one that we would have preferred. The main character and the many creatures he encounters would give the plant-people in Super Mario Sunshine a run for their money in bad design. On the other hand, Billy Hatcher is well animated and as a result moving him about the world is all the more entertaining. The locations are bright and tropical, always seeming to be on the edge of a great ocean or on the edge of a cliff. The 3D engine allows for a solid draw distance and a usually-smooth framerate, too. Meanwhile, the texture quality is sharp -- much more so than most of Nintendo's own games.  But there's still something about it all that makes us question whether or not Sonic Team realizes that it is no longer developing for the Dreamcast. GameCube, simply, is capable of much more on a visual level. The worlds themselves in Hatcher are severely lacking in polygon geometry and proper lighting and the camera system can be disorienting at points.   Sound No! No! No! This cannot be. The menu interface for Billy Hatcher comes complete with singing cheery music and the ~buck-buck!~ sounds of chickens whenever an option is selected. The character himself childishly shouts catch phrases in a very young, lame voice, and the in-game music startles and then attacks the ears, looping ridiculously happy notes over and over again until we can't stand it. Some of the sound effects, at least, are on par, from the popping of eggs to the rolling noise that accompanies their movement. Our recommendation: the mute button.   Billy Hatcher may look stupid, but sit down with it for awhile and you might just like it anyway. I did and now I do. I state this knowing that the main character is dressed in a rooster suit and that some of his more compelling catch phrases are rubbish like, ~Good morning!~ Theme noted, the play mechanics in place in Hatcher's world are sound, and manipulating the many eggs, hatching them, and then siphoning their abilities, is enjoyable. The only problem for me is that the action is also repetitive -- a drawback that I concede younger players probably won't notice, let alone care about.Hatcher is worth everyone's attention, though, not because it delivers an exceptional single-player experience, but because it serves up an addicting multiplayer one. The two-, three- and four-player arena battles in this game are extremely fun and satisfying. Try them and you'll be hooked.A solid puzzle-platformer with some minor mechanical and technical shortcomings. Give it a rent to check out the multiplayer mode and to see if it's worth adding to your collection.", "date": "Sep 20, 2003"}
