The timeless game show puts contestants on the top, forcing them to recognize popular songs through limited sound clips. It's actually a pretty perfect fit for cell phones, especially considering that the majority of today's in-use handsets still have limited audio capabilities.   Players choose a category of music from such standards as holiday tunes, TV/movie themes, hip hop, etc. (There is a Spanish edition of the game that features Latin music -- nice moves, Sonic.) The game starts playing snippets from songs in the selected category. When you think you know the song, you hit the answer keys and select the title from a list.   The tones in Name That Tune! are polyphonic. Now, I know what you are thinking. You've downloaded some ringers of favorite songs before and they sounded only remotely like the original. Fortunately, Name That Tune! does not suffer from this problem. The designers squeezed quite a few well-done polyphonic ringers into the game and never did I miss a question because the sample tunes sounded wonky.   Speaking of ringtones, Name That Tune! goes a step further than most cell phone game shows and actually offers real world prizes for your efforts. Should you manage to answer all questions correctly in a category, you are awarded a free ringer. Now that, my friends, is value.   Name That Tune! also offers tournament-style play where you answer questions from a central server. You are scored on time and accuracy. The winner receives a free ringtone. Head-to-head competitions are also handled similarly, with players not competing directly against the other, but matching up their accuracy and time after each gamer has answered all questions. Again, the winner gets a ringer.  Name That Tune! is a great overall package. The game itself is good on its own, but the addition of actual ringers as prizes and the additional ~multiplayer~ play makes it a superior value for mobile gamers. I wish more mobile games offered extra content, like ringers or wallpapers, as rewards for playing. Definitely recommended.", "date": "Apr 11, 2006"}
