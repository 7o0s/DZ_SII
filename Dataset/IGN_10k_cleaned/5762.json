The highly popular Star Wars Galaxies has recently been enlarged by a second expansion, Rage of the Wookiees. The new game adds an entirely new planet with the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk, loads of new missions, some new toys and, of course, the contentious combat upgrade. Though we brought you a sort of ~day one~ look at the game, we've now had the chance to explore more of the content and try out the new combat system in detail.  Offering a sneak peek at some of the content from Episode III, Rage of the Wookiees lets players take part in a number of adventures on Kashyyyk. The range of experiences here is fairly broad but the new area is not for the timid. Kashyyyk is definitely for the mid- to high-level player. Those who are willing to brave the dangers of this wild, new planet have a number of groups to ally with. You may take the side of the Wookiees against their Imperial and Trandoshan oppressors. Or you can join up with the Rodians as they hunt the dangerous species that inhabit this new world. It's interesting that there's a fair bit of interaction between the missions for the different groups. You'll find that one Wookiee quest brings you into contact with the Rodians or that you can help out a Trandoshan every now and then without totally getting your arms ripped out of their sockets the next time you go back to the Wookiee tree city.  Kashyyyk is only accessible from space via hyperspace travel; those of you who haven't signed up to get your own ship yet are out of luck in terms of getting to the new content. Assuming they know where to go, getting to and from Kashyyyk is pretty low-risk even for starting pilots. Limiting access might seem a little unfair but the barriers to get to Kashyyyk are relatively small and it ensures that you don't have hundreds of players just standing around the starport hawking their wares. (Sad note: Today marked the first day on my server that some billboard shouting automaton has finally taken up residence near the landing spot. We might as well have real advertisers in the game. ~This Hyperspace jump brought to you by Pepsi! Pepsi!, the choice of starpilots everywhere!)   Anyway, Kashyyyk is starting to get a little more crowded since it was introduced. As you get further and further into the experience, you'll find more and more breathing room. Unlike most areas in the existing game, Kashyyyk is divided up into a handful of distinct zones and you'll have to earn access to these new areas by performing quests. Some of the missions lead you from one zone to another quite naturally. The more aggravating ones will have you merely running back and forth carrying messages from one person to another.  Unlike some of the other planets already in the game, Kashyyyk has some fairly restrictive routes. Even on the more open-looking areas, you'll find your travel is confined to valleys and rivers. While it makes it easier to direct players to content, it also means there's a lot more running around here. Rather than going directly to your destination, you'll often find yourself spending extra time negotiating the alleys that lead to your destination. This is particularly aggravating in areas where they don't even allow vehicles or mounts. On that subject, there are a few new mounts and ships in the game, from the speedy Varactyl that roams the fields of Kashyyyk to the Jedi Starfighter that flies through the stars. I've been looking to trade in my old Z-95 for one of those new Starfighters but so far no one's biting.  Kashyyyk does seem to offer loads of new quests, most of which involve killing things or discovering other things that are inconveniently located behind things that need to be killed. In short, Kashyyyk is a very dangerous, combat rich area. Though players will enjoy the new missions, I was a little disappointed that the rationales or narratives behind them weren't more engaging. A majority of the missions I've run simply have me killing an arbitrary number of creatures or NPCs and collecting hides, livers, research notes, etc. It's not that I'm against killing (in a game) but I'd like to see more purpose behind killing 17 animals to gain access to a new zone.  I like quests with a little more context. Quests like the one where you have to search a dangerous area to find roots that will cure a terrible disease also involve lots of killing but it all seems to have a clearer purpose. One quest involving a captured Geonosian also leads to some interesting story points, even if the challenge level ramped up much too quickly than most players will be able to handle.  Like the missions in the core game, the missions on Kashyyyk seem to lead you towards other areas of the galaxy. There are message deliver missions, smuggler intercepts and loads of other mission types that will take you back to Tatooine, Corellia, Lok and many of the game's other locations. Since there's no bazaar terminal on Kashyyyk, you'll find yourself running back to civilization from time to time anyway. Happily, there's usually a Wookiee standing around, ready to buy the crap you've harvested from the animals you've killed.      There's even a whole series of space missions involving the Civilian Protection Guild that will have you protecting merchants from pirate attacks in the Kashyyyk sector. There are new mining opportunities among the asteroid fields of Kashyyyk as well making it a worthwhile destination for crafters as well.  Veteran players of Galaxies aren't going to be surprised by the quality of the sights or sounds of the new expansion. Though the setting and the inhabitants of Kashyyyk are visually unique, it still looks and sounds like Galaxies. The design of the new world is worth noting, however. The massive tree city of Kachirho and the dense undergrowth found in certain areas of the surrounding zones are really effective. The clipping and odd collision problems of the core game are still a bother on Kashyyyk, but the overall visual effect of the world is solid. The same is true of the game's music and sound effects.  There are still some substantial bugs that need to be addressed here. Creatures standing around in the air are all too common and some NPCs flagged as mission givers have nothing whatsoever to say to you. More frustrating than these are the rare inconsistencies with the missions themselves. One mission, for instance, tells you to return to Janno to claim your reward. There's no Janno in the game. The NPC who really wants to reward you isn't named anything even remotely close to Janno. It's not a critical mission but it's still pretty sloppy. I also find it kind of a pain that some NPCs with useful information won't share it with you until you've learned from another NPC that the first guy has something important to say. That's just a really obvious waste of time.  Finally, Rage of the Wookiees also introduces the highly controversial combat upgrade. We've already spoken with the developers about this in a lengthy interview and offered up Andrea's overview of the more positive aspects of the upgrade. For myself, I feel that the CU is a mixed blessing. On the plus side, I like the new icons and the lack of the combat queue. It makes combat a more intuitive more interactive experience. In losing the separate HAM bars, Galaxies has lost one of the more sophisticated and interesting aspects of its combat system. The fact that it also removes the danger of killing yourself with special moves and helps the developers balance content does make it easier to swallow but I really hate that the developers seem to equate complexity with confusion on this matter.   The new armor restrictions are definitely a good move and add a more variety to both the combat and crafting side of the game. Still, there ought to have been a better way to compensate players who'd spent money on items that they just can't use anymore. Since my character is pretty much completely combat oriented, I haven't been affected as much as players who are more tightly involved in the economy. Despite the fact that this is called a combat upgrade, the changes here have serious consequences for non-combat professions. Now that the ripples are spreading through the game, it's no surprise that a change of this magnitude is going to require some drastic rebalancing of other systems.  One of the biggest problems that I have with the upgrade is that the experience rewards are still screwed up. I don't necessarily think that you should get 2000 xp for beating up a monster that's 20 levels below you, but you ought to get at least more than 1 xp for it. To get the real rewards, you've got to engage in much more dangerous encounters. Those who worry that this places a greater emphasis on grouping will be happy to know that it is still possible to solo but it's definitely more of a grind now than it used to be, depending on how safe you're trying to be. In any case, I disagree with the developers that encouraging group play and retooling the combat system is essential to preserving the flavor of the franchise.  It's hard not to read too much into the motivation to release the upgrade in such a raw state. The folks behind the game claim that it has nothing at all to do with the timing of the movie but then they turn around and say that they were committed to launching it before releasing another expansion and that the timing of Rage of the Wookiees was set by the film's release date. Even I can connect those dots. In any case, expecting that a month of testing would be enough for a redesign of this magnitude seems pretty shortsighted.  As with all MMOs things will improve in time. In this case, the players have to learn a new system while the developers tune it. Three months from now it may very well wind up being a huge improvement for the game. I hope Sony and LucasArts can do more to help dissatisfied players weather the change.Kashyyyk by itself won't convince new players to try out Star Wars Galaxies. Like all expansions, it's a way to extend the experience for existing players and to make the overall package seem more substantial for those who are still on the fence. Though the content is engaging, Kashyyyk is, by design, a bit removed from the rest of the game. You'll still be doing the same sorts of things here that you'd be doing on other planets but Kashyyyk definitely has a flavor all its own. The smaller additions -- new mounts, cybernetics, etc. -- are appreciated but they're really incidental to the overall experience of finding your own role in the fight between the Wookiees and the Trandoshans or among the Rodian hunters off in the wilds.As far as the combat upgrade goes, there are some players who hate any kind of change and will rail against the new system no matter what benefits it brings. Personally, I think it has some good points and bad points. That may not be a brave or even controversial stance to take, but it's true. Some of the issues, like balancing experience rewards, can be solved with some fine-tuning. Other problems, like compensating for the investment players have made in their professions, can't be addressed so easily.", "date": "May 13, 2005"}
