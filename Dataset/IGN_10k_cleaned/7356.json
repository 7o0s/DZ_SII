More than two decades later, the quirky title has stood the test of time and continues to deliver fun in spurts. Though Dig Dug falls short in the same places that many other classic Live Arcade releases have, the tunneling and popping action title is still worth another look if you're a fan or a first look if you haven't yet given it a whirl.   Dig Dug follows a somewhat eclectic formula. As Dig Dug, it is your job to tunnel your way through the ground and rid the playing field of the goggle wearing Pookas and fire breathing Fygars. A single touch from an enemy, Fygar's flames, or being squished by a falling rock means you'll be turning up roses. Since the enemies can float through the ground like ghosts and move faster than you, planning your next moves in advance is the only way to survive. Enemies can be dispatched by nailing them with your harpoon and then pumping them full of air until they pop or by tunneling under a rock and making it fall on their heads. Slightly pumped enemies can't hurt you and must wait until they deflate before giving chase which adds a bit of frantic strategy to the game. It's a simple, yet undeniably fun formula.   As you might expect, playing Dig Dug with the Xbox 360 controller isn't the greatest way to experience the game. The analog stick doesn't translate well to four direction gameplay. The d-pad works, though an arcade joystick would be even better.   Like other Namco Bandai Live Arcade classic releases, the graphics and sound in Dig Dug have been left largely untouched. That means you'll get static picture bars on the right and left side of the screen to fill in the extra space. This time around the bars feature some nice hi-resolution art of Dig Dug and some Pookas. The main menu and option screens have also been given the flashy art update and look quite nice. Still, the main game remains untouched and purists will be happy to know that all of the sights and sounds of yesteryear were recreated quite well.   Is it just us, or is blowing up enemies with air until they explode incredibly disturbing? Following in the footsteps of Pac Man, the multiplayer side has been removed entirely. Although Dig Dug originally had the option to trade off turns with a friend, this feature is missing on the Live Arcade version, and it is missed. Being able to directly compete with others, either online or off, in a way other than through the online Leaderboards is something that would add a great deal to Dig Dug. A big reason these old arcade games were such a hit is that they inspired great competition for the high score. The option for trading off turns with someone next to you should have been included at the very least. Taking it a step further, playing simultaneously in a split screen (there's plenty of room for it if you remove those side bars) online against a friend would be ideal. Heck, add in support for the recently released Vision Camera and we'd be golden.   So if you've played Dig Dug to death in the past, the only real incentive to download it again and spend your five dollars is the online Leaderboards and Achievements. The Leaderboards keep track of your high score and allow you to filter the list three ways. You can check out the overall high scores, skip to your score on the overall list, or see how you stack up to those on your friends list. They work and they're a welcome addition to a game that is all about getting the high score.   The Achievements won't take long to get. Nearly all of the Achievements are incredibly easy. We secured 11 out of 12 of them within the first hour of play. Like Galaga and Pac Man, Dig Dug allows you to begin a new game at the highest level you've previously reached. Since most of the Achievements are associated with collecting the fruit or vegetable that appears after dropping two rocks on certain levels, reaching harder levels  to obtain the toughest Achievements becomes much easier than you'd expect. There is one Achievement that is cool and noteworthy. It involves digging out all of the dirt in a single level. More interesting Achievements like this need to be included on these classic Live Arcade releases.   The offline high score list is somehow still a problem, as it has been on other Live Arcade titles. Occasionally, you'll play for a little while and then turn off the game only to find that when you boot Dig Dug up again, your high scores and level progress are gone. The online Leaderboards will still track your overall high score, but you won't be able to keep track of your individual progress.  If you're a huge Dig Dug fan or haven't ever played it before, then the Xbox Live Arcade version is worth downloading. The game has been released on plenty of other compilations at a more wallet-friendly price, but the Leaderboards and Achievement points are a good reason to take another look at a classic game. Still, the price is a bit steep for a game that is 25 years old and doesn't even have the multiplayer options that the original did. At a lower price, we'd recommend Dig Dug without hesitation. It is, after all, an extremely fun and addicting game. For five dollars, Dig Dug on Live Arcade becomes more of a game for the hardcore fans and uninitiated.", "date": "Oct 11, 2006"}
