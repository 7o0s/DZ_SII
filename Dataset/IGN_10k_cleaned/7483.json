Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/31/1701-ad-review", "text": "Sunflowers and Related Designs have created a well presented, lovely, and satisfying economic simulation in 1701 using many of the principals from the earlier games in the series, 1503 and 1602, and simplifying or improving in some cases. The biggest change is the new and wonderful 3D engine, which allowed the developers to focus on much more immediate visual feedback. The result is good even if more information is still needed in a game that can be a difficult balancing act. Either way, this is the best in the series thus far and should please fans of the series and genre.   The focus of 1701 is on economics, supply, and trade through colonization of tropical islands in a historical simulation based on the European push into the Caribbean. Players take the role of an up and comer from an unnamed European country and will work to make the Queen happy while building up a functioning and profitable port colony and eventually make a move to independence. A strong tutorial, nice selection of scenarios, and long legged continuous play mode against AI or human opponents mean there's plenty to play here. Those that love constructing cities and seeing them flourish will find themselves embroiled for hours at a time while ignoring the game's reminder that you might want to take a break if you've been playing for two hours straight. Playing for two hours is an easy thing to do as most scenarios and games last much longer.    Most games (aside from scenarios) begin with a lone galley on the ocean looking for a port to colonize and call home. Moving the ship around will reveal islands in the area going so far as to reveal the entire land area of the island once sighted. This is a very happy feature as island colonization can require significant resources and deciding which island to begin on requires some careful thought of needed resources down the line. While many of the resources can be found or grown anywhere (lumber, meat, wool) many others require either fertility, associated with the type of crop (tobacco, hops, wheat, honey), or a resource deposit (clay, iron, jewels, gold) and won't be found on every island. In order to advance a colony to a new level, which is important as higher level colonists pay much higher amounts of tax, certain needs have to be met. Thankfully those needs are presented easily and players should have no problem providing the correct goods. All of the needs are cumulative so higher levels also require the needs of the lower levels they evolved from.   Needs aren't simply a matter of goods, it's also a matter of effects. Buildings like churches and theaters need to be built to provide faith and entertainment. Thankfully, these types of needs are easy to provide by placing down the correct building and seeing the size of it's area of effect and which structures will benefit upon placement.    The large number of needs and limited fertility of each island creates a nice level of inter-island dependency whether that's from player owned warehouses or trade with other factions. Purchasing goods from other factions can be pretty expensive so the best idea is to colonize and use other islands for production. Of course, the other factions (at least in the continuous play mode) are going to have the same idea. It's not unusual to see more than one colony sprout up on a large and valuable piece of land. The trick is to colonize and expand the area of influence as quickly as possible. This can be done by planting warehouses around the island. The area of influence of a warehouse determines what territory is owned by which player. Cover all of the beaches with the warehouse area of influence and another player won't be able to set up a colony of their own. This simple gameplay notion of controlling islands to control trade creates a sense of urgency not often found in economic sims. It creates enough urgency that another faction may decide it's worth building their army up big enough to take an island by force.   Combat is definitely a weaker aspect of gameplay, which isn't too surprising given the game's emphasis on supply chains and economics, but it does serve an important purpose. The naval military is generally for harassing the other players or defending against harassment. Once enemy military vessels appear in the water, it's a race to secure supply lines from other island chains by providing escorts for trade vessels. Disruption in the supply can cause a revolt in a city. For instance, any inhabitants at citizen level or higher are going to throw a serious hissyfit if they don't have tobacco or booze. That can cause houses to devolve which, because of that huge jump in tax revenue each level, means that disrupted supply links between islands can ruin a player. This means it's necessary to be quick about getting some protection for trade vessels moving between islands and ports.    The actual tactics of combat are extremely simple. Ship to ship combat is simply a matter of choosing a target and firing. Wind direction isn't an issue so maneuvering ships isn't necessary nor is worrying about the type ammo (chainshot, grapeshot, or regular cannonballs) that's being fired. Sea battles boil down to who has the bigger navy. It's understandable, though slightly disappointing, with the game's emphasis that adding these sorts of features might have been a little much to handle with all of the economic elements at work. One thing I would have loved is the ability to board and steal enemy ships along with their cargo. It could have added a bit more complexity to military maneuverings on the water. Land battles are a tiny bit more involved with the different types of units available so these battles can be turned by using the right units at the right time. That said, the usual battle is simply a chaotic mess of units running at each other and then someone coming out on top.    The tricky issue with the military is that units have very expensive upkeep (as do most of the higher level production buildings). Balancing an economy that manages to be in the black most of the time can be very difficult. Partially responsible is the lack of an itemized balance sheet. It's not necessary to play the game but it would certainly help to run things more efficiently. It'd be good to be able to see in one place, the number of buildings of each type, and how much they cost rather than just a lump sum per island. Knowing the consumption versus production rate of each good would also have been very helpful. It can be hard to prepare for a jump in colony level as the upgraded houses also fit more people, who in turn consume more of everything. In any case, it's definitely possible to play the game without the spreadsheets, but it's sad there isn't an option to look at them. As it is, it can be very hard to find a perfect balance, especially with military in play.   Once a nice balance has been created and a gradual increase in population can be accommodated, it's wonderful to see the colony grow up. Several of the other editors that work here in our San Francisco offices offered some extremely positive remarks for the visuals in 1701 after passing by and for good reason. This is one of the best looking sims around right now. There are several versions for each of the building types so that cities look more organic than those in Caesar IV, wonderfully animated inhabitants, enough color to satiate even the toughest critic's thirst for vibrancy, a bevy of landlocked and waterlogged wildlife, strong weather effects, landscapes packed with well executed items and textures, and some of the prettiest water we've seen lately. Perhaps the most impressive thing of all is that 1701 actually runs very well, especially when compared to recent economic sims like Sid Meier's Railroads! and Caesar IV. Camera movement is smooth and animations never really miss a beat. This is a well produced title with obvious attention paid to the technical aspects of putting so much life on screen at once.    Sound is likewise very pleasant. The issue of sound isn't overdone, but there's plenty to keep ears interested. City sounds are fun and while the inhabitant chirps that notify the player about how happy everyone is get a little overplayed after a few hours, they're voiced well and don't get annoying. You have to love the itinerant priest that helps you by telling the populace they'll burn in hell if they don't pay extra taxes. Voice work in general is very solid for this English speaking version. They found some wonderful voice actors to put lots of personality in the various character roles. Whether it's the pompous Winfred v. Schallert or the playfully violent pirate Ramirez the slightly caricaturized cast is fun to hear from.1701 isn't the best economic sim we've ever seen, but it's one of the best we've seen recently. The level of production values for this title are surprisingly high. Related Designs and Sunflowers pulled out the stops for their latest and it's well appreciated. Terrific presentation combined with a terrific engine, colorful art style, and some great sound production provide a winning package on the surface.Underneath the shiny exterior is a meaty game that economic sim fans will find enjoyable. Successful supply chains and economic harmony can be hard to achieve, and a little mysterious without the usual spreadsheets, but is worth the effort. Division of resources among different islands creates a more pressing need for expansion than economic sims often provide and will definitely create strife between rival players whether they're AI or human. Combat could still be a tad bit deeper even though it's not the focus but the lack of complexity in military action doesn't hurt much when economy is the obvious focus.1701 is a surprising historical economic sim game that fans of the sub-genre should be happy to jump into.", "date": "Oct 31, 2006"}
