Like its ancient arcade brethren Asteroids, Frogger, Q*Bert, and even granddaddy Pong, Space Invaders has been exhumed, updated, and made presentable for today's PC gamers. The result is a fast-paced shoot-up game, modest in scope but capturing the spirit of the classic arcade shooters.According to the manual and the movie at the start of the game, the invading aliens who were driven off in 1978 have returned with a vengeance, again forming slowly-descending rows intent on, well, landing. As a grim-faced, Judge Dredd-jawed soldier piloting the latest generation of laser tanks, you're the sole hope of the planet, and indeed the entire solar system.Yes, this time you must defend all the other planets as well (except Mercury; no one wants Mercury). Starting at Pluto and working your way in, you face numerous waves of attackers. Each planet introduces one new type of alien, one new type of special shot for your laser tank, and one new alien boss. After an introductory screen detailing the new alien type, you must fight through several screenfuls of aliens, pausing for a brief round of Motherships, several more screens of aliens, and then the final boss, before moving on to the next planet. The last battle takes place on Earth (Venus, being less dramatically appropriate for the endgame, fits between Mars and Earth).Like their low-res predecessors, the aliens line up in careful rows and columns, marching back and forth, moving a bit lower every time one reaches the edge of the screen. The most basic aliens (red, blue, yellow, and green-colored) simply drop bombs at you. Each new planet brings a new type of alien, with increasingly dangerous special abilities; Switchers (Neptune) take two shots to destroy; Blockers (Uranus) jettison short-lasting, impervious pieces to either side when killed; Anglers (Saturn) shoot diagonally; etc. I found that the Kamikazes (Venus) presented the greatest challenge, plummeting down like meteors when shot. Meanwhile, Motherships periodically coast across the top of the screen, dropping goodies such as shields and time stops when destroyed. As if you didn't already know, the aliens move faster and faster as their numbers decrease, until the last frantic singleton is left dashing back and forth. If the aliens manage to touch down, the game isn't over (as in the arcade version), but you do lose a life and the aliens move back up a few inches to begin again. The bosses that appear at the end of each planet are all unique and require different strategies to destroy. The manual describes the first four bosses and how to defeat them, but beyond that you're on your own. It's a good idea to save your game before engaging a boss, since their tactics can be unpredictable.Your laser tank has simple customizable keyboard controls: left and right, fire, and special shot. The special shots (aka Power-Ups) are one-time weapons acquired by shooting four aliens of the same color in sequence. Even the basic aliens provide very useful Power-Ups capable of taking out an entire vertical or horizontal row. The more advanced the alien type, the more havoc the corresponding Power-Up wreaks: some zig-zag, boomerang back from the top of the screen, or (my favorite) fire a solid beam that moves with your tank for a second or so, wiping out all that it touches. Also, by shooting the Motherships as they coast overhead, you receive dropped bonuses such as shields (saves you from one hit), max. energy (grants you a Power-Up corresponding to the last alien type shot) and double-shots (which last until your tank is destroyed).This is an absorbing game. Power-Ups add a bit of Tetris-style planning (breaking up the monotony of constantly shooting out the edge columns ), and can be your downfall if you're too intent on shooting just the right colored aliens. Some waves make it very easy to get Power-Ups and clear the screen quickly; for others, a barrage of double-shots is the best tactic. Gameplay is smooth and the generic techno music unobtrusively adds a certain pleasant arcade cheesiness. The aliens are vastly improved from the original in terms of graphics, spinning and pulsating as they descend, and each planet has a different background image. It's all still basically two-dimensional, though, despite the 3-D effects on individual objects.My only quibbles with the interface are outside the game proper  exiting requires a somewhat laborious series of confirmations. And the high score list replicates the three-initial arcade high score listing a bit too well, requiring you to up- or down-arrow through the alphabet. We have keyboards now, people! In the ~where'd it go~ department  the package refers to hidden worlds, but there's not a hint of them anywhere else. Did I miss something or was this left out? It's possible to save the game at any time, which may hurt its replayability if you don't approach it in an arcade spirit. By reloading whenever you lose a life, you can easily play through the entire game in an evening. On the other hand, how many evenings do you want to spend shooting at rows of aliens? As something to kill ten minutes or half an hour, Space Invaders works well; it's perhaps unfair to compare to Quake or Civilization in terms of lasting appeal.-- Karl Hiller", "date": "Jan 7, 2000"}
