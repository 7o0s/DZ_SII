In 2001, we've seen all kinds. The folks from Incog., Inc. went with a sharp, black concept, adding new elements to the car-combat genre, while also trying to separate themselves as far from Twisted Metal 3 and 4 as possible, and succeeding. THQ's Volition went with a brand new technology engine that added a new element to their first-person shooter, Red Faction, and they mostly succeeded.   Both decided to try something new, and they aimed high, but they approached the system with the knowledge that the stakes were higher, and that gamers wanted to be blown away by something new.   Majesco's approach to the PlayStation 2 isn't quite along the same lines. Soldier of Fortune, when it appeared on the PC in spring 2000, was a game that brought quite a bit of attention to itself with an intriguing technology, one in which body parts were literally blown off. It's a visually gory sight but it pushes the first-person shooter genre with a slightly different, unique approach.   Now we have Soldier of Fortune Gold, a port of the PC version. Majesco's angle on the PlayStation 2 appears much like this -- ~Hey, we have a great engine and a good game, why not bring this to the PS2? We'll tailor it to system, with mouse and keyboard support, and add a four-person multiplayer mode, and we'll rock!~ Well, that's not a bad idea, but it doesn't work here. Or rather, the execution didn't work. Soldier of Fortune Gold is a chuggy, old-looking game that looks and feels like a PC port, not like a PS2 game; it's filled with clunky control issues, offers a boot-string level of production, and it's just not the game that PC gamers appreciated nearly two years ago.   Gameplay The biggest problem with Majesco's approach to the PS2 reminds me of the first wave of games I saw on Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation back in 1995. Going from sprites to polygons, 2D games to 3D games, developers went through a long struggle in thinking about, and rethinking, just how to make 3D games, and what that new world of movement, control, and freedom meant. In that time of transition, gamers received games such as Clockwork Knight, Bug! and Pandemonium, first-wave 2 1/2 games that just didn't knock anyone's socks off. The developers just didn't realize what the competition would do, or that they had to go one step further. Soldier of Fortune Gold is just like any one of those games, a good or at least a decent idea, but poorly executed and definitely a result of a publisher being totally unaware of the level of quality the competitors would deliver.   As it stands, Soldier of Fortune Gold looks like an old PC game that doesn't take advantage of the PS2's capabilities at all, with gameplay as basic as Duke Nukem was back in the day. Soldier of Fortune Gold isn't a miserable flop, but it's certainly a poor showing, and not a game I recommend on PS2.   The original Soldier of Fortune was built on the Quake II engine, but with a significant level of tweaking, modifying, and expansion, the developers were able to create a mutated, strangely unusual engine that they called Ghoul. What it boils down to is an engine that enables characters to be hit in 26 different ~gore zones,~ each of which they react to when hit by an opponent weapon. Shoot an opponent in the shoulder, and it'll fly off the body. Shoot him in the knee, and he'll hobble around in pain. Blast him in the stomach, and he'll grab his belly in pain and curl up in a fetal position before slowly dying in a pool of his own blood. Soldier of Fortune Gold, a port of the original PC Soldier of Fortune, brings with it all of the most gory, visceral aspects that made the first game so much fun, and it's still very much that way.   The best aspect of the game, in fact, is viewing your opponents' reaction to your shots, still very much here in this port. In a sick, twisted, very game-centric way, there is a strangely satisfying feeling that runs through my body when I blast my opponents' arms and legs off. Their bodies react powerfully, jumping backward with the force of the shot, bouncing on the ground, their limb or limbs pulling off, leaving gibs and splatterings of blood everywhere. In a first-person shooter videogame, it's a rush.   But once you get over the novel feeling, the game is a very ordinary FPS that also packs some troubling control issues, annoying framerates, a silly multiplayer mode, and some of the worst load times on PlayStation 2. There are a few things on Majesco's side. There is mouse and keyboard availability, and Majesco did give gamers a big, long game. Soldier of Fortune Gold is 26 levels large, spanning 10 covert missions, and each one of the missions is couched in between cutscenes that progress the story. It's around 15-18 hours long, too, so that will keep you busy for a while.    Let's start with the control and framerate, two key technical issues that must be finely honed for any first-person shooter to be fun. Controlling John Mullins, your lead character, is very much like controlling any FPS on the PS2. Majesco has mapped the default controls just the way I like them, with L1 as jump, L2 as Crouch, R1 as shoot, R2 as secondary fire, L3 as move, R3 as look around and strafe, Dpad switches weapons, etc. Looking to appease hardcore gamers, Majesco has added keyboard and mouse compatibility via the USB port, which works perfectly well.   Regardless of the peripheral used, players will feel lots of sticky places, areas in which the fluidity of movement is hampered by some programming problem or another, probably one that involves collision detection. This happens a lot. But further hampering this problem is the unevenness of the controls. Your character seems to move either very fast or very slow, and the levels of gray in between are seldom. What's complicates this even further is that the game puts players in lots of situations involving tight jams, that require precise movement, and that are make or break. After playing the game for about four levels or so, players should be able to adjust and overcompensate for the game, but why should one overcompensate for the game's problems?   Like many FPS games before it on PS2, Majesco has opted for users to select either the Auto-target function, or to simply go at it freely. Given that the Dual Shocks aren't the best tools for precise control, players often find that they must use Auto-targeting to make things work. This Auto-targeting feature works well enough. And on that same positive note, the best part of the SOF Gold controls is the Sniper Rifle controls, which are smooth, easy to position, and pinpoint accurate (too bad the other guns don't feel that way).   After having seen a bunch of games at 60 FPS on PS2, it's hard to look at one that moves at 30, or drops even lower, on a regular basis. Soldier of Fortune hits 30, but it's often irregular, and even when the interactive environments change, blow up, or shift, you can see the framerate take a big hit. Luckily, Soldier of Fortune Gold mixes up its gameplay, with some intense, five-on-one situations, some fast-action scenes, but also some slow-paced, creepy situations that require slow behavior.   And last but not least is Majesco's seeming inability to get some kind of control over the PS2's innards, particularly on the production side of things. After long loading times, some of the longest I have counted for any PS2 game to date -- 48 seconds to load one of the levels, for instance -- the game is incredibly crude in its presentation. Switching from the game to the cutscenes, from one level to another, or in just about every situation possible, the game is clunky.   For example, Soldier of Fortune Gold will stop when the player reaches a waypoint, which needs to load in to memory. The game just stops like it's crashed, and while players wait to see if it has (about 10 seconds), they'll notice that right when they reach to restart the machine, a loading screen will pop up. Well, that's a relief! But then, another 20-30 seconds of the game will load up, this time thankfully with a neat-o loading screen, before you can play. Needless to say, it's a little jarring, in addition to being boring.   It seems like I'm nitpicking, but these things matter. Load times suck, and we've had five years of them being bad because of technology, and we have seen that the PS2 can indeed load games in quickly, so they should be better. Other issues of use should have been taken into consideration, too. When you die in a level, instead of being given the ability to just restart the level, players have to return to the game menu and load from there. That's stupid! The level is already in memory, so at the very least I should simply be able to restart from the death menu.   The multiplayer mode is a nice touch, in concept, anyway. Up to four players can get it on via Multitap, but after about 10 minutes of exploration, the ~fun~ will probably end. With a slower framerate than the single-player game and control that seems to put players on roller skates, the game feels like its constructed from rubber bands and taffy. Players are slowed whenever there are more than three characters on screen, and aiming becomes almost impossible. After about five minutes of adjusting the multiplayer game, our four-way deathmatch just became absurd. We couldn't shoot each other worth beans, and the frustration just evolved into mockery. What made it worse is the level design that seems to depend on narrow, useless hallways and empty open spaces that are weirdly constructed.   Graphics Just like the gameplay, when it comes to the visuals, Majesco's efforts on the PS2 look like the team was simply struggling to get something to work decently on PS2. The character models are rigid and unrealistic looking, albeit in a kind of cool, hardcore way. What I mean is, the enemy characters come in various shapes, from skinheads to flattop marines to bald, muscular henchmen, all of which maintain a kind of Street Fighter caricature art style.   With a framerate that's chuggy, and a basic set of ordinary backgrounds and lots of repetitive and very dull textures, Soldier of Fortune Gold does not impress in the least. It looks like a PC port that's badly ported, and not in any way a fresh new PS2 game.   Sound Funnily enough, the sounds in Soldier of Fortune Gold are the best part of the game. In a weird, kitschy way, almost by default, the game delivers an ominous soundtrack that is both eerie and suiting. I mean, after all, you are saving the world from possible nuclear destruction, so the game should sound menacing, and it does a great job at it.   The sound effects also are quite cool. The assortment of screams, yelps, and shrieks of dying pain are creative and unique, and always entertained me. Man, when a character dies in this game, you really hear it, and also, by default, feel it. The sound is just as visceral as the visuals, if that's possible.When it comes right down to it, Soldier of Fortune Gold has some good things going for it that just weren't executed well. We have seen awesome games that do everything right, from quick load times to speedy framerates, to beautiful production values, to tight controls, to just being original games. Soldier of Fortune Gold is problematic in every one of these categories. The only reason to buy Soldier of Fortune Gold is because you never had a PC powerful enough to run it back in April 2000, and because you love first-person shooters so much that you must have every single one. In other words, you're an addict and a packrat, and you can't help yourself. I won't try to sway you, but I might suggest that before you play this, there are handfuls of FPS games on the PS2 that shred this one. If you simply can't help yourself, at least rent this before buying.", "date": "Nov 15, 2001"}
