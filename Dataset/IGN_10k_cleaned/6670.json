On one side of the spectrum are games like Boktai and Wario Ware, games that constantly change the way portable gaming is played.  However, true value has also been found through the revitalization of franchises from the past.  Games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Doom, and the Classic NES series have made the GBA not only a great system for new content, but also a staple of classic gaming as well.  A new adventure can now be added to the likes of Zelda and Final Fantasy, as Namco releases Tales of Phantasia for Game Boy Advance.  While it may not be perfect, offering both the strengths and weaknesses of previous installments, Tales of Phantasia is a solid adventure nonetheless.   Tales of Phantasia fits an odd profile.  On one hand, the game looks, plays, and feels just like a classic RPG.  However, since a US release was never made, the story will be new to the majority of gamers that pick this one up.  While the story, characters, and events are all retained, Tales of Phantasia is actually an updated design, mixing original gameplay, new quests, and updated battle art (inspired from the Playstation version).  In all honesty, much of what was added turned out to be the major selling points for the game, and while it will be a blast for some RPG fanatics to play through, the dated gameplay may be too much for newer fans.  Since Phantasia is a bit of a mixed bag, readers should be warned that you will either love or hate this one.  There isn't much a of a middle ground.     A ton of work was done to make the game feel more mainstream, such as the addition of cooking, the ~title~ system (seen in Tales of Symphonia), updated character art and a more balanced mix of quests.  However, one thing that wasn't changed was the difficulty.  I said it in the Hands-On feature, and I'll say it again:  Tales of Phantasia is tough.  Within this seemingly innocent box lies the demanding structure of true classic RPGs.  Main quest items can be missed easily, characters will die repetitively, battles are random, enemies are ruthless, and support items don't come easy.  While this may be a huge turn off for some players, it is equally as encouraging for others.  Love it or hate it, Tales of Phantasia is a true classic RPG.   One aspect of the gameplay that could have used a bit more of an update is the battle system.  While the game's story and presentation have been preserved well, the actual battle control feels very dated, as it moves and feels just like it did over a decade ago.  In Tales of Symphonia, players had total control, and battles were smooth and fast.  Phantasia turns back the clock, and the gameplay takes a hit because of it.  While the ability to cast magic and pull off specific attacks is still retained, the battles will be far too sluggish and difficult for most modern players.  Character attacks take time to register, and once an attack animation begins, the AI is in control until that attack is finished.  In short, if you know yourself to be very specific in the way an RPG must play and feel (regarding both random battles, as well as fighting gameplay), you may want to steer clear of Phantasia.  The classic feel has been retained entirely, and though it keeps the game from straying too far from the original design, it still hurts a bit.   While not everything about Tales of Phantasia has stood the test of time, the strong story and updated depth to the game still make it a desirable adventure.  The addition of the title system provides a ton of strategy, as certain character titles will boost attributes depending on how the game is played.  Titles are awarded for successful side quests and play style, as well as additional exploration.  Along with the depth of the title system, cooking plays a huge part in Phantasia.  Much like in Tales of Symphonia for GameCube, cooking is a much deeper way to use item management.  Finding certain recipes to cook desired dishes adds yet another layer of exploration to the design, giving Tales of Phantasia more replay value than the original.   Even though Tales of Phantasia is a port of an SNES game, the graphical qualities, as well as audio composition, hold up relatively well.  The art style carries a watercolor theme, and though it is difficult to convert style onto such small characters, the artistic theme still comes through nicely.  The map system uses Mode 7 to scroll the world around the player, and though it looks a bit dated compared to modern RPGs, it captures the look and spirit of earlier games.  The audio is exceptionally good, even if it is a bit silly to hear digitized voice after each of the battles.  The transfer rate for VO is less than desirable, and the actual voice acting is totally shameless, but in a good ~master of unlocking~ kind of way.  The score for the game feels fresh and inspired, and I actually forced myself to play the majority of the adventure with headphones on in order to get the most out of it.    As a total package, Tales of Phantasia will be completely useless for some gamers and a complete treasure for others.  There is no way around the love/hate relationship that Phantasia forces, as it is a true classic RPG.  Battles are random and difficult, control is less than perfect, but the story and depth of the characters are amazing.  If youre scouring your current GBA collection looking for another adventure, Tales of Phantasia might be the answer.  So how do you know if its right for you?  Any gamer who enjoyed Sword of Mana despite clunky control, owns Riviera even though its slow and tough, or loves Sigma Star Saga despite the random battles should be assured that Tales of Phantasia is right for you.  The team managed to take a lost classic, bring the original design to America for the first time, as well as include new quests and depth to assure fans their moneys worth.  For those who can love Tales of Phantasia for what it is and where it came from, a true classic awaits.  Be forewarned, however:  Tales of Phantasia is not for everyone.", "date": "Feb 28, 2006"}
