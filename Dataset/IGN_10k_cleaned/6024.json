After being announced for the PC some years back, the title was first released on the Xbox last year. It didn't quite live up to the promises made on its behalf early in its development but the action-RPG format and the importance of your choices in the game made it a real treasure on the Xbox. The competition's a bit stiffer on the PC, of course, but the PC version of the game is still a worthy addition to any action or RPG gamer's library.  If you don't know much about Fable, you've not been paying close enough attention. Last year Lionhead's ambitious, highly hyped RPG offered Xbox players a chance to explore a very original RPG world, a world closer to Zelda than Morrowind on the RPG scale, but with a level of depth and sophistication not normally seen on the consoles. Next week the title will finally make its way back to the PC. Though a few additions have been made, you'll find that Fable: The Lost Chapters is very much the same game that won so many fans in the console realm.  The most enjoyable aspect of Fable: The Lost Chapters is the sense of connection and involvement you feel as your character advances through the story. While games like Dungeon Siege and Knights of the Old Republic have characters that develop abilities and reputations according to your decisions, Fable: The Lost Chapters takes this concept to a new level. Not only does your character change physically to reflect your play style, but the game world also reacts to your decisions and accomplishments in a very natural way.   At the most basic level your character's abilities change based on how you play. Though the majority of experience points you earn will be put in a common pool to spend on any of your abilities, you'll also earn bonus experience points based on which abilities you're using. Swing your sword a lot and you'll gain plenty of points to spend on physical abilities. Cast a lot of spells and you'll find that you'll have more points to spend on will powers. Since it's impossible to be good at everything, you'll find that there's even more incentive to go back and play through the game again taking a different path.  These preferences for one type of ability over another are reflected in your character's appearance. Focus on melee combat and your character will develop powerful muscles. Focus on archery and stealth and your character will take on a slim appearance. Focus on magic and your character will age more quickly.  While the aging mechanic is interesting, it has absolutely no impact on gameplay. Older characters aren't less attractive and suffer no penalties to their physical abilities. Your age won't even stop you from adventuring like it does in Pirates! While it's interesting to see your character grow old, the fact that you'll age at the rate of about a year per game day seems a bit awkward, particularly so given the fact that no one else in the game seems to age. I'd love to have seen some way for aging to be more a factor of time management than a merely cosmetic feature.  There are other cosmetic variables for your character. As you engage in combat you'll gain permanent scars. As you eat and drink more, you'll start to get fat. You can also choose from a wide variety of hairstyles, tattoos and clothing. Each change affects your alignment, your appearance and your scariness. Go around town dressed in assassin's gear, for instance, and you'll find that people are more intimidated by you. Beyond the impact on the actual game itself, you'll find that you'll develop a real sense of vanity about your character. You'll really start to worry when he goes gray or starts to develop scars. I even found myself picking outfits based not on how much protection they provided but based on how cool they looked. Witness my awesome chicken hat.  Your character's appearance will change based on their alignment as well. Choose the path of good and you'll have a pleasant glow and a subtle halo spinning over your head. Choose the path of evil and you'll grow short horns and nasty looking eyes. In addition to the moral choices you make in the game, you can also affect your alignment by specializing in certain spells or outfits.       There are plenty of options to exercise your alignment choices. When you find the deed to a brothel, for instance, you can either choose to become the new proprietor or convert the house into a refuge for disadvantaged women. When you catch a local man cheating on his wife, you can either keep the secret for him or reveal his infidelity to his wife. Each decision is going to push you towards the good or evil side of the scale. Like most games that offer some sort of alignment slider, you'll also find that murder is okay as long as you're killing the right people. These opportunities are present at nearly every level of the game and that the people in the world will respond to you in different ways depending on how good or evil you've become.  You'll find plenty of expressions you can use in the game, from striking a heroic pose to inviting people to kiss your ass. While it's cool to play around with the different expressions, the only effect it has on gameplay is in allowing you to court a wife. Even here, it's a fairly passive affair. Rather than forcing you to react to your target's response, you'll merely just have to cycle through all the flirt expressions until your target falls in love with you. There's no real interaction here but there are some interesting consequences that come up if you start flirting with other women once you're married.   The story path in Fable: The Lost Chapters is very linear and not really very different from the Xbox version. The story itself is good but it lacks the epic quality found in other big RPGs. Though there are some interesting story elements here and there the overall narrative makes use of too familiar motifs. Your family is attacked and you spend the rest of your adolescence training to take revenge on those who wronged you. Yawn. Getting through the events of the story is less about appreciating the narrative and more about discovering the interesting ways that the world responds to your actions.  Fable: The Lost Chapters purports to be about a third larger than the original game and the majority of these additions are extra optional quests. Patronizing the ladies at the Darkwood Bordello or working your way up through the fight clubs located in each town will give your character some more ways to pass the time but I still found myself running through the whole game in under 20 hours. (If you explore every nook and cranny in the game, you can probably stretch the gameplay out to twice as long but the rewards for doing so are slight.) The only addition to the main story quests comes right at the very end of the game and feels really tacked on. Though the mission is nice, it introduces a brand new character, a brand new area and a brand new situation that has no bearing on anything that's come before.  Though the new optional quests help to fill your days, dedicated players will still find themselves running short of quests from time to time. It's true that the PC version has more meat on it but I'd still like to see some quests generated dynamically based on the state of the world. The point in the game when the assassins start hunting you down is a good indication of the sort of thing that I'd like to have seen more of.  In terms of building a sense of consequence, it's odd that Fable's missions don't actually ever permit you to fail. If you screw up and go wrong at any point during a quest, the game simply prompts you to restart the quest without any penalty whatsoever. While this makes sense in terms of the essential quests that advance the main story, it seems inappropriate for the optional side quests. At one point, I wrongly (and entirely accidentally) killed a bandit leader during a confused breakout attempt. How much more interesting would my character's story have been if he had been forced to live with the stain of that failure as his career moved forward?  Perhaps it's unfair to hold the final product to some of the promises that were made during development, but I also wish that the game had included more dynamic competition with other heroes. While you'll still find yourself competing with other heroes, the competitions are all highly scripted. The dynamic of working against the clock to complete quests before other heroes can get to them would really have added a lot more urgency to the game. There is, for instance, a test to pull a sword from a stone in the game. If other heroes managed to achieve the quest, it would have interesting effects on later events.      Even without these elements, there's plenty more to do in Fable: The Lost Chapters. Players can opt to take special boasts for each of their quests, gambling that they can complete a quest with certain limitations. Players can also discover all manner of time-specific content. The fight clubs located in the towns are only held during certain hours of the night, for instance. Your character's search for a wife can also fill a lot of time as you seek out  a likely candidate, woo her, prepare a marital home and eventually pop the question. Though many of these diversions offer little in the way of immediate or obvious rewards, they do manage to help pass the time between the missions.  In terms of the interface, Fable: The Lost Chapters works really well on the PC. Though you can rebind the keys to suit your needs, I found the default WASD setup to be relatively convenient. The mouse is used for fighting; the left button attacks, the right button blocks. Shift keys allow you to use the mouse to cast two slotted spells and cycle through to more spells using the mouse wheel. Potions, items and expressions can all easily be mapped to a variety of easily accessible hotkeys. One of the most significant improvements over the Xbox version is that you can now use spells and weapons at the same time.   There are some problems with the basic interface though. For one thing, many functions are bound to the same key, meaning that you'll sometimes pick a move that's entirely out of context. Having the flourish and run commands bound to the same button means that you can't rush up to a distant enemy without first discharging a stored flourish. The shift key that activates spellcasting is also the key you'll need to press to attract the experience orbs to you. I can't tell you how many times in the heat of battle that I tried to grab orbs in between swings of my sword and just wound up casting spells by accident. One other problem with the interface is that you can't type in amounts for donations or bets. Having to scroll up through a couple thousand numbers is unnecessarily tedious.  Thankfully, gathering experience orbs and gambling are secondary to the whole experience. What really matters is that the combat controls are solid. Attacking with the left mouse button and blocking with the right mouse button is very easy. Since the attack swings cover a wide arc, you can be reasonably certain of hitting whatever you happen to be facing. The game sometimes suffers from Diablo-esque click frenzies, but an experience bonus for stringing together attacks without being hit yourself encourages a little finesse. Archery controls are a little more complicated primarily because it's so much harder to move around while aiming and shooting.  The only real pain in the ass in terms of combat controls is that the lock-on function will occasionally select a friendly target instead of an enemy. In the heat of a crowded battle, this can happen too often and cause all sort of headaches. Thankfully, when you're not in lock-on mode, you can freely swing away without fear that you'll accidentally wound your allies.  While we're on the subject of combat, there's a pleasant range of enemies. The main enemies you'll encounter include vicious hobbes, shambling undead and wily bandits. Moving beyond these rank and file enemies, you'll also be confronted with massive earth trolls who smash the ground, agile balverines who leap in and out of combat in a flash, and a whole host of boss monsters, from the stinging wasp queen to the multi-armed, death-breathing kraken.  Some of the enemies are particularly troublesome, but death isn't too much of a worry in Fable. The frequency of resurrection vials means that dying is only a temporary setback. If you die you'll merely be resurrected a second later complete with a full health bar. Given the availability of health potions and healing foods in the game, you'll rarely ever burn a resurrection vial.      The graphics are beautiful, even better than they were on the Xbox. While the overall framerate on the Xbox version is a bit better overall, I was able to get good performance on a 3GHz processor using a GeForce 5900 and gig of RAM even with all the graphics options turned up. You'll still seem some frame rate problems but they're tolerable (and the low load times more than make up for them).  The textures are much better on the PC than they were on the Xbox. That and the higher resolutions possible on the PC make Fable: The Lost Chapters a very striking game. The overall visual style helps the game stand out from other RPGs. Everything has a sort of stylized, fairytale quality to it, thanks both to the visual design and the subtle lighting effects. The autumn forests have a warm, golden tinge, while the more haunted woods have an ashy pallor over them.  Though the areas you play in are on the small side and fairly linear, they're simply bursting with details. Forests and cities are filled with all manner of objects. Cities are filled with old-looking buildings, loads of crates and barrels, and dozens of inhabitants. The wild areas are decorated with flowers, small pools of water and realistic looking trees. There's so much attention to detail here that you'll even see the knots and grain in the planking of docks and bridges.   You'll love the character models at first, but you'll soon wonder why there isn't more variety. The barkeeps and wandering traders all look exactly alike, for instance. Thankfully, a lot of attention was paid to the named inhabitants, particularly the player's own character. Animations are very strong as well, adding a sense of life to the entire game. I particularly like the combat animations.  The sounds are even better than the visuals. The star of the audio side of the game is the brilliant opening theme by Danny Elfman. Anyone familiar with his music knows what to expect here. The dreamy, fairytale quality of the music is apparent in the shape of its melody and the tasteful instrumentation. The music used during the game really highlights the action well. Moving past the score, the ambient sounds of the world around you adds a lot of realism to the game.  Overall, the game has a great sense of humor. The NPCs that you encounter throughout the game have great dialogue. The bar patron who asks for a beer with an umbrella in it, the witch who complains about people seeking her help, the runner at the Heroes' Guild who complains that you've broken one of his race records all manage to create a stronger sense of life and humor than is found in most other games. Though the small comments people make as you pass by reference your past actions and your reputation, they do eventually get a little monotonous.If you're one of the unfortunate gamers who never had a chance to experience Fable on the Xbox, you owe it to yourself to pick up the PC version and discover all that it has to offer. Though it lacks the massive scale of Morrowind or the dense story of Knights of the Old Republic, Fable makes up for it with loads of style and atmosphere.  At every turn the world feels wonderfully alive and the consequences of your actions have a real and obvious impact on the world around you. The identification you build with your character is stronger than in any other RPG I've ever played. After all, isn't that what roleplaying games ought to be about?Now if you've already played through the Xbox version, the improvements in the PC version might not be significant enough to warrant picking up the new version. The new content is actually the weakest draw here. Though I like the extra missions they don't really expand on the core experience of the Xbox version. The new interface and improved graphics certainly make the PC version more enjoyable than the Xbox version but not to the extent that you'd need to rush out and play through it all over again. Given the game's flexibility in terms of alignment, it's definitely worth picking up for those who played the original once as a good or evil character and now want to see what the other half is like.", "date": "Sep 16, 2005"}
