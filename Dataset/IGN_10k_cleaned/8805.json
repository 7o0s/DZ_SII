The music entertainment arm of Sony puts both feet in the mobile arena with this hardcore gamer pick-up, a cross between Disney's ~TRON~ and the arcade classic Robotron 2084. Naturally, fans of the Live smash will be skeptical of the mobile edition of Geometry Wars... and they should be. How do you replicate the precision controls of two analog sticks on a cellphone?   Developer Hardcore3D Wireless' answer: You don't -- so don't even try. Instead, the developer has smartly fashioned six control schemes that offer different combinations of movement and shooting, strafing and lobbing smart bombs. There is a great test mode in the options menu so you can try out each control scheme and determine which one works best for you. After trying all six, I ended up sticking with the first option -- your ship shoots in the same direction of travel, but you can strafe by locking the shot direction with the 5 key. It's not perfect, but it's entirely functional and considering the second change Hardcore3D and Sony BMG made to the game, it renders the game quite playable.   The mobile edition of Geometry Wars is considerably slower than the console original. This helps console gamers get the hang of the new controls and allows newcomers to the franchise (which will soon see release on the Nintendo Wii and DS) to survive longer than ten seconds. The enemies vessels, from the green squares to the snakes, are dialed back a few clicks -- and, honestly, I think it's just a hair too calm. Geometry Wars is not just about hellzapoppin' visuals (something the game handles admirably when the screen fills with Technicolor shapes), but a breakneck challenge. While casual gamers might dig the syrupy pacing, I found myself frustrated by the occasional lack of challenge. I'm no expert at the Xbox Live Arcade game and I was surprised by just how long a single life could last me in this mobile rendition.   But this is the real conundrum of porting a hardcore game to mobile -- preserving the essence of the original while playing to the specifics of the mobile game experience. Geometry Wars succeeds to a degree. The game is loaded with the sights and sounds of the original, but the challenge just isn't there for fans of the original. In fact, to be perfectly honest -- no hyperbole -- I actually survived for 36 seconds while just running a finger around the edge of the directional pad, firing in every direction (I looked like the death blossom from ~The Last Starfighter~) without moving my ship. That's just too easy.   Hardcore3D has done an excellent job by adding mobile-exclusive play modes, called Challenges. These extra modes offer specific tasks, such as being the fastest to earn nine lives in Feline or scoring huge points with the 10x multiplier in Monster mode. These challenges don't have an ending, you just replay to best your previous achievement. These are great add-ons that give Geometry Wars a nice value boost. You can also just breeze around the screen on Immortal without worrying about crashing. Finally, the game offers online leaderboards for posting your scores.Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved for mobile is a strange creature, especially for fans of the Xbox 360 original. While I was surprised to see just how well Hardcore3D emulated the essence of the game (the screen pops with awesome color), the changes for mobile -- necessary as they might be -- will likely turn off loyalists. The game is just too slow. However, I can imagine a casual player that's merely heard of Geometry Wars and has no history with the game enjoying themselves, as the core of the game is still solid and it looks great. I cannot give the game two scores for two different audiences, so I'm going to hedge it with a respectable 7.5 that I hope invites casual gamers but makes hardcore players take pause.", "date": "Jul 21, 2007"}
