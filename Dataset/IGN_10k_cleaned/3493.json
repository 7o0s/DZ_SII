Kakuto Chojin and Kung Fu Chaos failed to shine, putting a heavy burden on the shoulders of Studio Gigante's Tao Feng: Fist of the Lotus.  With Mortal Kombat's co-creator at the helm, Tao Feng comes with legitimate star power behind it.  Attempting to bring some new concepts and innovations to a genre that, in many ways, has begun to grow stagnate, Tao Feng is certainly a different kind of fighter from Kakuto and KFC.  But is Microsoft's latest entry into the fighting fray another failure?  Not at all.  Features Next-gen fighter from the co-creator of Mortal Kombat Swing around poles, break limbs, knock opponents into the environment Choose from any of thirteen brutal fighters Battle against a smart and aggressive AI opponent in a large 3D environment Challenging quest mode will test even the best player's fighting abilities Dolby Digital 5.1  Gameplay Tobias has long wanted to implement his full vision of a fighting game, but never had the console or the backing to do so.  With Tao Feng he has both.  So what was this vision?  A more open fighting game, with large environments, rewards for aggressive play, removal of the traditional ~round~ system, and a heavy reliance on combos.  And, for the most part, Tao Feng is a smashing success.  Gamers who choose to pick up Tao Feng and give it a whirl will find a tough fighter (really, about as hard as they come) that does its best to counter many of the cheese moves fighting experts have come to rely on the past decade.  While Tao Feng doesn't necessarily look like the next evolution of fighting games, it's certainly a good start.  Once you get used to leaping off walls when you're backed into a corner, it's hard to hop back to another fighting game that leaves you trapped and at the mercy of your buddy's cheese moves.   Using the environment to swing off poles and beams, utilizing your Chi powers to wreak powerful (and easy to perform) attacks on your enemies, and staying aggressive to wear down your opponent's defenses and eventually break their limbs creates a unique and new fighting gameplay experience.  And so does a lack of timer or official rounds.  Tack on the graphical successes and more voice over dialogue than I've remember hearing in a fighting game, and you're on the road to something fresh and exciting.  And Tao Feng is certainly that.   Control yourself Controls for Tao Feng are simple and can be learned within a couple of minutes.  The face buttons act as punches and kicks with the strong and weak hands and feet.  The black button is for taunting and the white button performs Chi attacks, all of which will be explained in just a moment.  The right trigger allows a character to spring off a wall or swing around a pole and the left trigger is used to heal damaged limbs when your chi meter is filled.  Have another round Tao Feng redefines the typical ~rounds~ system.  Instead of best a three rounds format, Tao Feng has one single fight.  You and your opponent have three health bars.  Each time one bar is depleted, you get a short cut-scene showing your fighter weakening and highlighting the progressive damage.  Bruises, cuts, and torn clothing help illustrate your fighter's worsening condition.   These three health bars essentially act as three rounds for a character.  After all, you knock down a character's health bar three times and you win.  However, in traditional round systems, each character begins the next round with full health.  In Tao Feng, there is no health reset.  So when Exile knocks off Fiery Phoenix' first bar of health, Exile continues the fight with whatever health he had remaining.    This, along with the lack of a timer, does a few things.  Most importantly, it keeps the fight fluid.  With no time limit, you're forced to defeat your opponent, not merely get in a few strikes and then defend until time runs out.  You've got to bring the fight to your opponent in order to win.  And fights become a lot longer than in most fighters.  There are no thirty-second fights here.  The average fight may last anywhere from three to seven minutes.  I've had a few last longer.        In a lot of fighters, when you have a ~best of~ round system, you only need to create a strategy for each separate round of the fight.  With Tao Feng, you're forced to maintain and adapt your strategy throughout the fight.  Your opponent has you on the ropes and has a full health bar up on you.  What do you do, hotshot?  Will you have to become more aggressive?  With the lack of rounds, the tables in Tao Feng can turn surprisingly fast and a player on the ropes can put serious heat on their opponent and edge their way back towards equality.  The intensity of a battle that takes several minutes instead of seconds is incredible.  You know that anxiety you get when both fighters are low on health in a round and you know one or two good hits means the difference between a win or loss?  Now imagine those few seconds of tension spread into a minute or more.  I'm definitely down with the other goodies Studio Gigante managed to build into Tao Feng, but the lack of rounds and a timer might actually be the most satisfying.  And that's also due in part to the combat system and how fights progress, which I'll talk about, um, now.  Fists of fury The first time someone plays Tao Feng, in fact the first few times, it's not pretty.  Until the basic combos are learned, many attacks are stilted, short, and make the game appear slow.  However, once you learn even the quick three and four button combos, fights becomes very fluid.  The combo system is basically broken into three parts.  The first is a series of short combos that anyone with half a brain (even an IGN editor) can pull off.  Then there are the extremely complex combos, which can string over ten complex button hits.  Timing for these is crucial and it's quite tough to pull many of these off.  The third combo set comes from improvisation.  Every character's moves list is relatively short, because Tao Feng was designed to let you string together your own combos.  It's not nearly as smooth as Soul Calibur, but there are a lot of combos out there that you'll discover on your own through experimentation.  Tao Feng is a combo-heavy game.  It's meant to reward those who learn and use combos effectively.  And while that helps create some awesome moves, it also creates the absolutely most frustrating and disappointing aspect of Tao Feng.  As cool as it is to see a game that relies heavily on combos, Tao Feng takes things too far and offers too high a reward for long combo strings.  To block in Tao Feng, you just need to hold back or down and back (for low attacks).  And holding down and blocking is fairly easy.  However, if you fail to block the first blow of a combo, you are essentially at the other player's mercy.  You cannot block or sidestep a combo once you've taken the first hit.  If you have impeccable timing, you can get a quick strike in to disrupt a combo, but this is not easy.    What happens is you will find yourself missing a block (it's gonna happen, even to blocking whores), and then you must suffer ten, fifteen, even twenty-five hit combo strings.  You're pretty much screwed at this point in time and, honestly, I've put my controller down in the middle of some of these moments and just walked away.  There's not much you can do but suffer the hits.  You have to be able to block or evade a combo in some manner, even if it's difficult.  The quick strike option isn't enough of an escape option.  In most fighters, if someone gets you airborne, you accept that they will juggle you and you are pretty much unable to stop them.  But Tao Feng does not rely on air juggles for the majority of its combos.  Instead, you will watch your fighter kicked and punched and thrown around the massive arenas with a stunned look on their face.  It's incredibly &#$%ing frustrating.  Yes, it's so frustrating, it merits the use of symbols in its description.  It's the one aspect that keeps Tao Feng from true greatness.  What's perhaps more dismaying is that this is pretty much how Studio Gigante wanted it.  But it means that it's incredibly easy for novice players to get their asses handed to them again and again.  In every other fighter out there, a novice player has some hope that they can get a bit lucky and beat a tougher opponent.  But if you can't pull off a ten-hit combo string and your friend can, it's not going to be a pleasant experience for you.  That said, Tao Feng has a lot more to offer than what's mentioned above (which is why the rest of the review is continued below).  So, despite, how &#$%ing frustrating it can be, the game has enough great points to make it a solid success.  Heck, I haven't even mentioned most of the cool stuff.    Hold me, Steve As you'd expect with any fighter, Tao Feng has a grab system.  Each character can do three different character-specific grabs.  The grabs are often complex in terms of what's happening, but an absolute snap to pull off.  Cost of an Xbox: $200.  Replacing the controller you will surely break in anger: $30.  A copy of Tao Feng: $50.  Watching Exile do a backbreaker and then discard his opponent like he's waste: Priceless.  Power moves come in the form of Chi attacks.  As you fight, your Chi meter fills.  The more aggressive you are, the faster it will fill.  Once your Chi meter is full, you can either choose to heal damaged limbs or perform one of three character-specific Chi attacks.  The Chi attacks aren't always guaranteed hits and not all of them do mammoth damage, but they all look fantastic.  And these attacks aren't complex, like pulling off a fatality in Mortal Kombat.  It's just a matter of pressing the white button with a direction on the D-Pad.  The fighting and controls are easy, but the long combo strings are tough.  You can seriously pick up and play Tao Feng and master the controls and basics within two fights.  But to master the game, it will take you oodles of hours.  Have pole, will swing The coolness doesn't stop with grabs and Chi attacks.  The real invention of Tao Feng is something it never really invented anyway.  Anyone who dug swinging on poles in Power Stone will love Tao Feng.  Each of the thirteen well-designed levels has poles of some kind that you can swing off of for a devastating attack.  Sometimes they are literally support poles, other times it is the part of a statue or a stalactite.    To pull off a pole swing, just point towards the pole and squeeze the right trigger.  This is easier said than done sometimes.  You may think you've done the move right, but you won't swing on the pole and will have left yourself open for a twelve-hit combo string.  Owie.  But, in general, you can grab a pole when you want.  Along these lines, you can press the d-pad towards a wall or object you're near and propel yourself at your opponent.  The purpose here is to protect you from being trapped against a wall while your buddy pummels you to death.  It's also a pretty powerful attack, depending on the character.  The only problem I have with the wall jump move is that, while it seems placed there to help prevent cheese moves, the move itself is a cheese move.  Many a time I have beaten the ridiculously tough computer AI opponent by wall jumping at them until the end of time.  Even though they may block many of the attacks, I still benefit.  First, excessive blocking leads to limb damage (which I'll yak about next) and second, even if someone blocks the attack, I'm earning Chi. Do it enough times and I'll have filled up my Chi meter and can then dish out a strong Chi attack.  Sadly, even the best intentions don't always come off perfectly.  However, I love the wall jump aspect, particularly because it makes the environment all the more important in strategy and gameplay.    Arms aren't meant to bend that way There are two ways to damage limbs: Excessive blocking and being knocked into the environment.  Block too much or get knocked into the environment too often and you'll receive a limb damage alert, followed by a red danger warning.  Once you're in the danger zone, a single solid hit to your legs or arms will cause limb damage.  This doesn't target individual limbs but is separated into either upper or lower body damage.  If your legs are hurt, for example, you'll move slower and will only do 50% damage with kicks until you heal yourself with your Chi. Injured arms do 50% damage as well.  Players are rewarded for knocking opponents into the destructible environment.  But they are also rewarded for being aggressive.  You know how your jack ass friend blocks for five minutes in Street Fighter then throws an attack, then blocks again for five minutes?  Boring and annoying, isn't it?  You simply can't do that in Tao Feng.  Once the limb damage alert sounds, your opponent will usually become even more aggressive, because they want to hurt your limbs.  At the same time, if you remain on defense, you're only ushering in the limb damage.  You simply can't sit around blocking all day, waiting for an opportunity to attack.    Are you an environmentalist? And with all of these things lending to a unique strategical mindset for the game (gotta get him near this wall and attack, stun, use my chi, then taunt him, then pole swing...), the environments also lend to gameplay.  Where many fighting games are either boxes or circles, and most have edges where you can knock an opponent off for an easy victory, Tao Feng refuses to take part in the tradition.  Instead, environments are shaped like real places and filled with objects to get in the way.  The arcade, for example, is circular, but also has a set of arcade cabinets in the middle and a square food court to the side.  The museum has sculptures and a fountain clogging up the walkway.  Plus, just about everything in the environment is destructible.  See that statue? Yeah, you can break that.  See those paintings?  Yeah, you can ruin those.  See that tile floor?  Yeah, you can crack that.  But there are no multi-tiered environments, which sucks.  It's a different kind of game, in that regard, than DOA 3 but the environments are actually cooler.  You just can't kick a guy out the window of a building.  But the large environments lead to a major problem for Tao Feng.  The camera switches a lot.  You'll always see both characters on screen, but when there are specific locations on every map where the camera will suddenly flip.  The problem is, you may be trying to block, pressing back on the D-Pad.  The camera switches angles and you are suddenly moving forward.  I guarantee that this will happen to you enough times to really piss you off.  Because you'll end up walking right into an enemy's attack.  Tao Feng encourages you to walk and explore the environment and even more so than DOA 3 you will range across each map.  And that means the camera will often come into play.  It's especially bad when you're stuck fighting in a cul-de-sac corner.  It's not a good thing when part of game strategy is to avoid areas where the camera screws you up.  Get the balance right The character's are well-balanced so one fighter may be slow and powerful, another has weaker attacks but speed to balance it out.  It never feels like one person has advantage over another based on the character they choose.  Though, the leader of the Black Mantis sect, Wulong Goth, is easily the least fun.  Some of the women tend to feel a bit similar in control and balance and perhaps a greater diversity there would have helped Tao Feng to the next level.  Still, character balance is definitely not an issue with Tao Feng, with the exception of the one unlockable character, who can kick just about anyone's ass with ease.  But then, that's how it tends to be with final bosses.    A.I. The AI tends to be highly aggressive.  There are five difficulty settings, but really the middle medium setting is going to be tough for most casual fight fans.  Unfortunately, when the game difficulty is lowered, it's not a matter of hits doing less damage, but the AI tends to drop to Forrest Gump-like levels.  Enemies will stand around, they won't use their Chi powers, and they won't do many combos or grabs.  There's not a fine middle ground between too easy and difficult.  Quest Mode Tao Feng features one of the most detailed story modes ever to grace a fighting game.  There's a lot of backstory to the Quest Mode, which pits two sects, the Black Mantis and the Pale Lotus, against one another in a battle for Immortality.  Taking a cue from many old Chinese parables, the quest for Immortality requires each faction to gather six sacred items to gain entrance into a mythical temple.  Each item, though, has been broken into six pieces.  When you begin Quest Mode, you choose either to take control of either the Pale Lotus or Black Mantis.  Each character must then battle through and beat the members of the opposing sect to earn the six necessary pieces.  To complete Quest Mode, you'll need to beat every Black Mantis member with every Pale Lotus character, and vice versa.  And, of course, you'll have to beat a final boss.  What makes Quest Mode different from your standard Arcade or Story mode is that there are no continues, and you don't have to do it all in one sitting.  Beat Wulong Goth with Master Sage and the game will save.  Hop over and take control of the Fatalist and challenge Iron Monk next if you want.  Or maybe you want to continue on with Wulong Goth.  You can choose any order you want and take any number of hours, days, and months to finish Quest Mode.  It's just a matter of beating each and every character, which amounts to 72 total battles (plus two more against the final boss).      And that's a cool thing, because it adds more weight to the Quest Mode and it allows for a much deeper story than most Arcade modes.  And Quest Mode is not easy.  Though things will start relatively simple and you'll be able to beat your first few foes on the first try, the more you defeat, the tougher the AI becomes.  By the final character, you may literally have to fight them 20 times to get a victory.  This is kick-you-in-the-nuts kind of hard too.  Frustrating at times, but fun.  My only problem with Quest Mode (aside from the difficulty forcing me to throw my controller into my wall and waking my neighbors) is that the reward for completing it sucks.  It's hard and it will take at least 10 hours for most gamers to beat the entire thing.  And your reward is two incredibly weak and boring cut-scenes and an unlocked character who has no grabs or Chi powers.  Boo!  The rewards have to match the challenge.  For Tao Feng, that's not true.  There are other modes than these Despite it's problems, the multiplayer helps a lot, simply because you don't have the difficulty of dealing with the computer's tough-as-nails AI and instead are facing off against a buddy.  But the single player mode will test your skills mightily and, in the end, make you a better fighter.  With Quest Mode, you have a detailed training mode to show you each character's different moves, Tournament so you can have your own round robin affair, and the requisite Survival mode.  If I had any gripes here, it might be that for all the attempts to do something ~new~ with the genre, the extra modes are the same as in every single other fighting game out there.  Gameplay is important, but if you want to expand the genre, someone's going to need to think of some new game modes.  Graphics Tao Feng does a lot right visually, but has one major problem that hurts some matches -- slowdown.  But beyond this, Tao Feng is an attractive fighter.  The character models are great and perfect for the game.  Studio Gigante wanted to make these fighters mythical, more than human, and they certainly did.  Exile is enormous, but he feels frightening real.  The level of detail, especially the veins on his neck, make him practically jump off the screen.  Specular highlighting, real-time environment and player damage, great character designs, particle effects aplenty, great cut-scenes -- you couldn't ask for much more.  Every fighting game should have progressive body damage and Tao Feng's is awesome.  Black eyes and deep bruises, even cuts are all there and occur throughout a battle.  The environments aren't your standard box and circle.  Instead, you get a variety of different shapes for levels.  Some levels, like the rooftop, are relatively small.  Others, like the museum, will let you travel a good distance.  It's surprising to see how much exists within some of the environments.  If only their could have been multi-tiered environments.  But, you can't have it all the first time out.  Not all is rosy in the visuals, though.  Certain characters in specific environments create some immense frame stuttering.  Iron Monk and Exile are the main culprits, but it seems that only a few of the environments cause them problems.  But lord, don't try and pit them against each other unless you want to see the framerate cut in half.    Along with the framerate problems with Exile and Iron Monk, not all of the animations are as fluid as they could be.  Soul Calibur offers probably the most natural and fluid animations of any fighter out there.  Tao Feng doesn't even come close.  It's not that the animations look bad, but if you're not pulling off combos, the animations looks a bit stilted and even cut off.  They need to be a bit more natural.  Despite these problems, Tao Feng is a gorgeous fighter.  The slowdown doesn't hurt the gameplay and it's an acceptable trade-off for the beautiful effects and environments.  Sound There is a ton of voice in this game, which is surprising for a fighter.  Though each character only has two taunts and a few expressions, Master Sage and Wulong Goth offer intros for every single battle in the game (that's 72 intros!).  The individual voices are a lot more limited and nothing more than what's come from every other fighting game.  But the voice acting is good, at least.  The score is a mixture of old school Chinese and light techno and offers a beautiful backdrop for the beatings that occur.  Some of the music offers a stark contrast to the sounds of destroyed environments, punches, and kicks.  You won't hear bones break, though, and some of the Chi attack sounds could be more dynamic.  But Studio Gigante did a great job of creating unique sound environments for each area.  So when you're in the museum, you get an echo and the voices and sound effects echo differently through the five channels.  Tao Feng makes good use of 5.1 Dolby Digital in game with environmental sounds swarming around you during a fight.  Too bad there's no custom soundtracks. Tao Feng will make you scream and curse at times, but it's a great fighter.  As much as the Quest Mode drove me nuts, I didn't want to stop playing it.  The blocking and the camera issues are the only real problems with the game.  I can deal with the framerate drops, but man, don't screw me over with the camera.  And the blocking, oy... But the game is gorgeous, the Quest Mode voice overs are surprising and the story is deep, and it's fun.  The grabs are devastating, the Chi attacks look cool, and the strategy involved in compelling.  Definitely worth your $50.", "date": "Mar 14, 2003"}
