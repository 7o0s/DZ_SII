It's a lot like another recent Eidos project, Herdy Gerdy, in that the things it does well are things nobody ever does well, and the things that make it a big fat pain in the neck sometimes are the things that have done exactly the same to a fistful of other games (most of them similarly ill-advised PC-to-console ports).  The people who made this game created something brilliant the first time around, and they have obviously done their damnedest to bring the same brilliance to the PS2, but there's only so much that can be done with a console interface, and it never quite seems to be enough.  Gameplay  To begin with, the good bits, which are many and varied.  Deus Ex is a masterpiece of game design as far as offering freedom to the player goes.  You gradually build a character out of a wide selection of equipment, special skills, and cybernetic augmentations, following any number of different advancement paths in doing so.  The way your character develops then makes for a huge difference in how you play the game.  This is not like a lot of other adventure/RPG games, where your character gets stronger, the enemies get tougher, and thus nothing really changes, except for maybe more impressive spell effects once you get to a really high level.  In Deus Ex, you can choose to play an entirely different kind of game the second time through, just by buying a different set of skills.  This is all bound up with puzzle design, because the creators of Deus Ex took the trouble to build a fistful of different options and solutions into every area of the game.  My favorite example is an airport dock, relatively early on.  For one, you could have entered this place at two different points, depending on which exit you took from the last place.  This in turn affects how you deal with the opposition in the area, which consists of a few human guards and a set of automated security robots -- the humans are nearer the one entrance, while you have to watch out for the robots on the other.  So what do you do here?  You pick 'em.  If you're a talented hacker, you can break into the security towers that surround the area, reprogram the automated gun turrets, and watch them kill all the robots.   If you're heavily armed, you can whip out your shotgun and Guided Explosive Projectile cannon for the DIY approach.  If you have good stealth ability, you can tranquilize the guards, nick the exit key, dodge the stupid robots, and escape without killing anyone.   What is also neat about the game is that it rewards trying different solutions to problems.  Taking an alternate route often leads to an alternate destination, and even when you must be railroaded towards a particular place, Deus Ex makes up for it by offering two or three ways to get there.  Furthermore, such is only done in service to a major plot point, which makes the breadth and depth of the game's narrative all the more surprising.  From the innocuous beginning to the dire conspiracy hell of the third act, conversations and story events are affected to a remarkable degree by your decisions.  There's even a pleasant modicum of  karma in evidence -- few games do such a neatly subtle job of reminding you that violence is not necessarily the best solution.  And there has never been such a nifty employment of real-life conspiracy theories in any visual entertainment medium (although as books go, I still prefer the classic Revelation X).  The X-Files, let's be blunt, has become a parody of itself, and anyway it never did a very good job fleshing out the details of its backstory.  Deus Ex has great fun starting off with a touch of the old Rothschild international banking conspiracy, plus the Trilateral/CFR political conspiracy, before taking off into the depths of the Majestic-12 UFO conspiracy, the government/AIDS conspiracy, the old-skool Illuminati conspiracy, and the modern paranoia that it's actually a computer running everything nowadays.  I'm amazed I didn't stumble across a copy of the Tophet Document somewhere along the line, but perhaps that was just a plot fork I missed.  The PS2 version actually spruces things up a bit in the cinematic department, with better character animation for some of the realtime cutscenes and several nice pre-rendered cinemas.  The latter look a little primitive by console standards, but they whip the PC version's hollow (even though I can't figure out why the line ~Let it spill over in the schools and churches~ was cut from the PS2 intro movie).  But then it comes time to play the game, rather than just look at it, and there the trouble begins.      The PS2 version is better than I could have ever expected as far as wrangling the massive inventory and character development system, but that's still more cumbersome than the keyboard-powered PC interface, especially when it comes to swapping between active items and augmentations.  The real problems, meanwhile, are to be encountered when dealing with the simple business of aiming.  Combat was intentionally difficult in the original version of Deus Ex (like Metal Gear Solid, it offers a substantial incentive to employ stealth and brainwork instead of violence), but on top of that intention there now sits the inevitable difficulty of aiming with the Dual Shock controller, at short and long range.  What was point-and-shoot is now fiddle-with-the-stick-for-some-time-whoops-the-target-moved-do-it-over-again.  The trouble is that this is a failing of the hardware, not the software, and so all the extra aiming features still can't quite cure it.  While the auto-aim is somewhat helpful, it's of the irritating magic-bullet variety (the crosshairs points somewhere else, but the bullet hits the target anyway).  The L2 ~plant and aim~ feature is better, since it lets you aim more precisely yourself rather than doing it for you, but it still runs up against the problem of using the analog stick to center a crosshairs on a moving target.  Finally, neither of these help with the frenetic business of hand-to-hand combat, which is a particular shame, because that's the type of confrontation emphasized in the early areas of the game.  When you're first trying to come to grips with the controls, it's not an awful lot of fun to try and cattle-prod terrorists with a twitchy analog stick while they run laps around you.  There are other issues.  Some of them are held over from the PC version, especially the dopey AI guiding the behavior of the enemies, and the strangely variable damage dealt by shots to the head.  Others are new to the PS2 version, particularly longer and more frequent load times (since the PS2's memory can't hold as much of the levels at once).  Saving, at least, is unusually easy -- you can save anywhere, and although a card holds only 10 saves, that's a huge improvement on the 20-meg save files of the PC version.  Aiming, however, is the big one.    Is it enough to cripple the game entirely?  Good question.  My opinion is colored by the perspective of one who can walk 15 feet to the left and play the PC version at any time (although I may get some flak if I try and boot it up during business hours).  You can also ignore all this dithering if you're willing to play the game with a USB mouse and keyboard, since it does include those options (albeit unsupported).  That note aside, I would recommend that if you have any way to play the PC version instead, do so.  It's no longer that tough on modern hardware, even considering that the Unreal engine dates from the brief Glide-uber-alles period in 3D game design.  Chances are, the computer you're using to read this could run Deus Ex.  If you have absolutely no access to a decent gaming PC, and experience doing battle with first-person controls on PS2, then you may have better luck than I.  Certainly it would be a shame to miss out on Deus Ex entirely, since what it does well it does better than almost anything on the market.  Graphics  If you question why I'm making bold statements before this category, well, visuals weren't much of an issue even in the PC version.  Fully patched and running on our GeForce3 demo system, it still looks kinda hinky now and again.  The PlayStation 2 version of the Unreal engine afflicts the PS2 version with its usual quirks, particularly that strange low-brightness/high-contrast dark quality to the textures, but it offers better character animation in trade, which does a lot (comparatively speaking) for things like the death throes of helpless terrorists.  There's better lighting in places, too, particularly from explosions.  In comparison to the PS2 market as a whole, though, this baby doesn't look so hot.  It runs at a decent framerate, which is more than folks with TNT2s got back when it was first released, but the background architecture and character models are still very rough around the edges, and while the animation is better in gameplay, the realtime cinematics move very stiffly in comparison to any number of console games.  PC games have never been very strong in that area, and after Metal Gear Solid 2 and Final Fantasy X, it looks like it will stay that way.  Sound  Thanks to this odd review template, however, we may exit smiling, thanks to excellent sound design.  It's not quite as heavily emphasized as it was in the Thief games, but Deus Ex still employs sound as a significant element of its stealth/action gameplay.  Managing the noise of your footsteps is key to sneaking about effectively, as is listening for the presence of the enemy.  If the mechanical ~scanning area~ call of a security robot is a little too loud, it's time to run like hell, especially if it's followed by the chnk-chnk of its cannons loading.  In the many cinematic sequences, the voice acting is excellent -- Tom Hall could probably do this full time if he ever decides to bail on the game-design thing.  The musical score fades into the background in comparison, making itself known mostly during cinematics and loading sequences.  There's a pretty clean transition in gameplay between ambient sounds and more intense tracks, however -- start a fight and the soundtrack lets you know bad things are about to happen.  A little skip still becomes evident if you go straight from ~normal~ through ~yellow alert~ to ~lock and load/run away very fast,~ but it's nothing to moan about.In the end, though, the PC version offers almost all the satisfaction with a fraction of the frustration.  The PS2 version equals the PC control experience only if you're willing to plug in a USB mouse and keyboard, and it's hard to hold those on your lap when you're sitting in front of the TV.  Ion Storm put an admirable effort bringing this game to PS2, but Deus Ex is so wonderful to play in its original form that I can't help but recommend it be appreciated thus.  I don't offer a thorough condemnation of the console port, but if you do play it, you're missing out.", "date": "Apr 1, 2002"}
