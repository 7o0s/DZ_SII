Meanwhile the hotty on the phone can't seem to understand why I am cussing my very existence as a game reviewer at that moment.  WE all know that many people find it hard to understand how someone paid to play games could possibly have anything to gripe about.  But rest assured, after a few days of playing through a game like this one...you would have a perfect understanding.   Gameplay ATV: Quad Power Racing is the late and lone entrant into the wonderful world of PlayStation racers.  It certainly shares the distinction of being a four-wheeling racing game with none other.  That is one humble boon I will certainly throw its way.  After that, it's trash talkin' time.  So let me dispense with the one thing about this title I certainly liked, and that was the interface.  The interface in ATV: Quad Power Racing kinda' looks and runs like one of those Macromedia Web sites that you hate -- that is if you run anything less than a DSL/Cable modem or better.  However, since this nifty interface is not on a modem, and it comes to you via your trusty and, in my case dusty, PlayStation -- it moves about at a nice clip.  It is snappy, fancy and navigable.  That is the interface I am referring to folks.  The rest of the game is...well...awful?   It can't be that bad, you say!  Well, truth be told it certainly can.  This game screams early, pre-PlayStation 1 launch test-code.  I actually pulled out some early racers for PlayStation, such as Road Rash to compare and ATV: Quad Power Racing ain't winnin', placin' or showin' folks.  I am sorry to say so, but it is true.  You know, the only thing that kept coming to my mind as I played this beast was a line from the movie Apocalypse Now, ~The Horror! The Horror!~   Now, I have never, ever used this word in a game review, but I am going to digress, regress and address this very clearly:  This game sucks! There, I said it.  So why does it suck Fabian? I'll tell ya.  After the neat-o-rama interface you are greeted with a standard set of choices an options, including Time Attack, Single Race, Two-Player, Championship and the normal game tweaks for music, sound effects, controller configuration and all that jazz.  Then, you choose from a set of characters that have about as much character development as a Beginning Readers book. I mean you just don't know Jack$#!+ about these people.  Well, you do know what race they are by their skin tone.  Moreover, their names Samuel Stone, Mitzi Chen and Heather Gold lend some sort of miniscule flare, but that's about it.  Then you choose between one of two available ATVs, take your pick on the Automatic or Manual transmission and then its off to one of three [initial] locales for some nauseating racing.  If you can call it racing at all.   Graphics On the track you get a choice of camera angles that includes the requisite first-person driver's view.  Surprisingly, this view is quite playable despite the host of maladies the game hosts.  Even at the starting line you can really get a feel for what you are in for with this title.  The look of the game is poor at best, though the color palette is not all that off the mark.  It is the quality of the textures and the ugly way in which this game renders itself that will make you feel like you just pissed away some good change.  The frame rate is all over the place, based upon the view distance and the number of players on-screen, to the point that it quickly becomes comical to watch in action.  That is if you can stop the urge to heave as you negotiate the terrain.  There is also so much 'chop' in this title that Miyagi would want to train the developers for the next Karate Kid flick.  Seams pop up all over the place.  Somebody call a tailor!  And the texture detail is downright criminal.  Now I realize that, with this being the first four-wheel racer, it postures the title as a first-generation effort.  But with all the other titles under Acclaim's belt, you would think it could have incorporated something old, something new, something borrowed and already it could have something blue. If it sounds like I am trying to find things to say about this game you are right.  I really want to avoid standing on my desk shouting, ~Crap, Garbage, Crap.~  I know that sounds harsh, but I gotta level with you peeps, so you won't want to lynch me when you buy this and say, ~Fiddlesticks...Fabian made me do it.~  Give me a break, I really am trying to keep this clean.  As far as the levels and difficulty go, the game has 12 tracks and there are shortcuts to be found.  Alternate, professional routes are available as well, but those are coned-off until you graduate your sorry@ss rider from the Amateur ranks.  Now here is a funny thing that comes to mind, did you know that you actually have more grip and traction in the snow than on dry land?  Did you know that you can go through a whole race in First Place only to have one tap in the butt slow you to the point you finish sixth?  But never fear as newer, faster ATVs can be unlocked as you win races.  That should do the trick right?  Wrong!  This game has little to know balance, very poor racing AI and never really gets past go...or is that Start?!   Sound The music in this game sounds like the stuff Austin Powers would leave behind at the music store.  Actually, as I progressed through this game I started to really understand something important.  Most of the sounds were lackluster and the fervent desire I had developed to cuss the daylights out of  Doug Perry [EIC, IGNPSX and IGNPS2] were totally induced by the hypnotic drone of the music in this game.  Sorry Doug, but I am cured now...thank goodness.  If Roger Ebert were doing this part of the review he would offer, ~Two Thumbs...Way Inside Ears!~I ain't getting' cranky in my old age, I just expect more from thedevelopers and publishers when it comes to anything they offer the consumerthat costs money.  The damn game should, at least, be fun right?  If anyother company has tackled trying to do a 4-wheel racer and has met withsimilar results, I can understand why this one is billed as, ~...the only Quadracer in the world, period.~  Perhaps this means that unlike, QuarterbackClub 2000 and 2001, they won't actually try this again?  Well, let's hopefor now anyway.  We'll see what they can do to revive this lame duck nexttime.", "date": "Sep 19, 2000"}
