Unfortunately, reviews are supposed to be more than a word long which means that I'm forced to string together several hundred more of them in an attempt to describe to you, our faithful reader, just how bad it really is. Now unless you've been living under a rock or were swallowed by a whale in the last couple of years, Shrek is the popular movie from 2001 that told the computer-animated story of a grumpy ogre living in a fairy tale land. His ultimate goal in life was nothing more than to be left alone. Toss in the twists and turns of a meddling midget ruler needing a bride, a damsel in distress, a talking donkey, and a message about true love, and you've got yourself one dandy of a picture. That said, it's quite unfortunate that the game never lives up to the standards set by the movie. In fact, anyone who loves the Shrek franchise should simply watch the film again rather than participate in this poorly-constructed party escapade.   Gameplay  First, let me assure you there is nothing super about Shrek Super Party.  To be truthful, there's very little that even borders on likable. The main mode is essentially a 3D board game featuring half-dozen different Shrek-inspired locations, including the swamp and castle.  Four players (if you have less than four, the rest are controlled by the computer) choose one of six characters (Shrek, Donkey, Princess Fiona, Lord Farquaad, Monsieur Hood, and Thelonious the executioner) to try and score the requisite points before everyone else. Points come in the form of bug juice, which is earned by traveling the board and competing in various competitions.     Moving around the board, each player will land on a variety of different squares. Some will have you stealing juice from an opponent or challenging them to duel, while others pit everyone against each other in a huge no-holds barred challenge. Sounds fun, I admit, but it's horrendously droll, incredibly boring, and terribly executed. The 30 mini-games that make up duels and challenges will probably only be difficult for those who find it difficult to string sentences together. You know the type --the kind of folk who need someone to dab drool from their chin whenever they use nouns, verbs, and adjectives.  I mean honestly, what kind of challenges are these? One mini-game for instance, has you trying to blow bees off a flower by farting on them. What the hell is that?   Other challenges are as equally bizarre and uninteresting, including several different races where you the only thing to it is moving your character in limited directions with an occasional jump. Who knew that there would actually be a game out there to make Rayman Arena look like a Van Gogh?    As boring and pedantic as Shrek Super Party may be, at least it doesn't have any technical problems with the exception of the occasional clipping.  The mini-games are playable enough to refrain from causing you to rip your hair out in frustration or without any confusion, but that doesn't mean that they're actually any fun. Super Party is quite the opposite of its namesake in the fact that it's a bit of the party stopper, and is best reserved for those special house-clearing moments when you want to be left alone, or perhaps an even better use would be as the first bona fide cure to insomnia.   Graphics  Shrek represents the look of the movie pretty well actually, and boast arenas that mirror sections of the movie counterpart rather closely. At least you can tell the difference between Shrek and Farquaad, which could be viewed as some kind of accomplishment right?  Strangely, ach character comes with an enormously big head, which is apparently supposed to appeal to the kids (though a few may be equally as frightened and terrified by the lack of proportion). Textures are blurry and poor, the game moves with slow and plodding animations, and doesn't offer the bright and varied color palette that it should. This is supposed to tap the power of the PlayStation 2? I think not!   Sound  Not much to speak of here: sure, there's a nice vocal assigned to the narrator, but his is the only speech in the entire game -- not a good move. Equally, the sound effects are pretty weak and the score that plays in the background is not only sparse, but also poorly inspired by the cool tunes in the movie. Truly, it's better to simply turn the volume down and let your child make their own sound effects and obnoxious commentary. As there's nothing else worth listening to.Do not pass go and head directly to jail. Shrek Super Part is bad, boring, and frightfully trite. When is a company other than Nintendo finally going to put out a decent party game? When will all this bigheaded, sloppy-built madness finally end? If you love Shrek (or even if you've never heard of him), spare yourself the trauma and divert your ever-living essence in the opposite direction of this terrible abomination.", "date": "Nov 21, 2002"}
