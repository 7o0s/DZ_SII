The Gran Turismo series has sold innumerable copies and garnered countless praise and awards from the press, and for good reason. Polyphony has practically become synonymous with street racing, and though the company has begun including rally racing in its tour-de-force racing series, it has yet to touch on the world of two-wheeled racing - until now, that is. Polyphony's first venture into motorcycle racing is Tourist Trophy: The Real Riding Simulator, an offshoot of sorts of Gran Turismo 4 that seems intended to test the waters for what's possible.   On the whole, Tourist Trophy feels something like a kissing cousin to Polyphony's own Gran Turismo 4. Many of GT4's assets and features have been carried over into Tourist Trophy, everything from the menu system to the music to even the tracks themselves. When it comes down to it, it really is just bikes vs. cars that separate the two games, with a few changes to the career mode path thrown in to both simplify and mix things up.    Just as Polyphony has done with a car's physics and driving mechanics, it has absolutely nailed the feeling of hopping on a motorcycle. Well, I've admittedly never actually driven a motorcycle so it's sort of guesswork, but playing Tourist Trophy feels exactly like what I'd expect a motorcycle to drive like. It's difficult yet natural, unforgiving yet fluid - it's almost like trying to come to grips with a new pair of legs.   There's certainly a bit of a learning curve here as many of the skills you may have acquired with Gran Turismo or other driving sims are actually opposite of what you'll need here. For example, in a car, if you tap the gas in a tight turn you can cause the rear wheels to lose traction and use your car's over-steering to help you take the turn a little tighter. On a bike, you'll actually want to use the brakes to do this instead, pulling down on the front brakes in order to flip the rear end of your bike out.   Aside from these subtleties, those who aren't used to motorcycle racing will find that it's a very different beast than any other vehicle. For one thing, since leaning and shifting your weight is more important than turning a couple tires, you need to lean into corners really early in order to get your bike to take the turn well. You'll also find that it's better to be conservative than aggressive, especially to start, as the slightest misstep can send you careening off the track, and dirt doesn't play well with motorcycles.    Like Gran Turismo, it's the subtleties in the driving mechanics that make Tourist Trophy shine. Dropping into a corner feels like you're actually shifting your weight and committing to the turn, allowing gyroscopic forces to take over and keep you inches off the ground as you whiz around a turn at 100mph. There's a sense of weight to the bikes that transfers to your controller so well that it's easy to tell exactly what forces are working for and against your bike at any time. Should either of your tires lose traction, you'll feel it. After one turn, you'll have a pretty good idea of how heavy a brand-new bike is and how hard you can try pushing it. Polyphony manages to translate simple bits of information into feelings of speed, weight, power and traction of four wheels better than anyone else, and Tourist Trophy is proof that it can do the same with two.   The differences between all of the game's bikes are readily noticeable from the first time you hop on each one. From weight to turning radius to power, every bike feels wholly different and like its own beast. You'll even find that some bikes handle high speeds much better than others in terms of things like stability and speed wobbles. It might take some of the heavier bikes forever to get up to speed, but their weight translates to a smoother ride at 150mph+ than some of the lighter, quicker bikes as the wind will start kicking the ride from side to side. In other words, speed, handling and acceleration don't quite mean everything, and it's great that Polyphony has been able to pick up on and transfer these aspects of each bike directly to the gamer.    As mentioned, much of Tourist Trophy's content is borrowed directly from Gran Turismo 4. This makes sense in many ways and is something of a mixed blessing. On the one hand, it makes the game feel something like an expansion or half-baked rip-off rather than its own game. But, when you consider that many of Gran Turismo's courses are real-world locations, and some of the most well-known courses in the world in fact, it only makes sense that they're here as well. It certainly does help that the artists and designers at Polyphony have become masters at recreating real-world tracks and designing original courses. So even though you've seen all of these areas before, they really couldn't have gotten any better, and though it would have been nice to have seen at least a few new tracks, the selection here is good enough that it'll pass.   Though all of the included tracks are also found in Gran Turismo 4, a fair number of them have been retrofitted specifically for motorcycle racing. You'll find new chicanes here and there to mix things up quite a bit, so even if you think you have your lines down from GT4, you'll have to re-think certain sections entirely as some of these sections are tight. Most courses remain mostly unchanged, though the new changes are generally drastic enough to entirely change sections of some courses.    One thing that is unique to Tourist Trophy in most ways is its namesake mode (the main single-player mode). Like Gran Turismo, you'll find a series of racing events that have certain qualifiers for vehicle entry. Some have maximum engine powers assigned, like 250cc or 1000cc, while some require ~racing modified~ bikes in order to compete but may not have power restrictions. In addition, you'll also find a series of challenges to compete in whereby passing your rival(s) for 10 seconds or beating them to the finish line will nab you the bike you take into the challenge.   While the race events are fine in theory, there aren't many that are specific enough to certain bikes that will force you to change between a large variety of rides. For the most part, you'll nab a 250cc, 750cc, 1000cc and something higher and race with those until the end. Rather than earning money from races and buying bikes and upgrades as you go, you earn bikes from winning races or challenges, which can be done in any order (providing you have the proper license to enter a specific challenge).   So, once you've picked up most of the licenses, you can simply do the challenge assigned to the best bike for any race restriction, unlock it and have a leg-up on the competition. It doesn't take any more time to earn a 150hp bike than it does a 20hp bike, so there isn't really a feeling of accomplishment tied into earning it. You never have to work your way up from scratch, winning various races here and there, pocketing your money until you can finally pick up your next big car.    While Tourist Trophy does allow you to customize aspects of each bike, like its spring rate, gear ratio and so forth, any or all of these features are built into each bike. In other words, there isn't an upgrade shop you can head to and pick up new parts to pep up your aging ride.   So with the fact that you can simply jump to any challenge you want and pick up any bike with no more trouble than the difficulty that comes with driving the faster bikes, and the fact that you can't purchase upgrades for it, Tourist Trophy loses much of the sense of individualization that Gran Turismo has. Sure, the same cars are available to everyone in GT4, but given the fact that you have to save cash for race after race and then commit to a big purchase, each car really feels like you've earned it and customized it post-purchase. That unfortunately doesn't happen here and really is the game's biggest drawback.    It's obvious that the stars in any one of Polyphony's games are its vehicles, and that's certainly true in Tourist Trophy to a large extent. The bikes do lack a certain bit of individualized personality given that it's harder to distinguish between two like-models than with cars, and most people new to the sport would have trouble picking out a Honda CBR1100XX from a lineup of bikes even after they've raced it a million times. Even still, the bikes do look phenomenal.   Graphically-speaking, as Tourist Trophy uses the existing Gran Turismo 4 engine, you can expect the game to look identical to said racing game. The detail present in the bikes is simply stellar, the nooks and crannies in each bike's chassis created with impeccable precision and detail. In the fantastic cockpit views for each bike, you'll see detailed instrumentation and working rear-view mirrors that go a long way to helping represent the game's sense of speed. The one ~downside~ to motorcycles is that since they're quite compact and intricate by nature, it's generally hard to see all of the exceptional work that went into them. Because of this, the game isn't as obviously impressive at all times as it maybe could be, but that's the nature of subject matter.    While the bikes look damn nice, what's possibly even more impressive is the physics-based animation of the riders and bikes themselves. Leaning into a turn, you'll see your rider tuck his body, tilt his head, pop out his knee and shift his weight to the inside in an extremely fluid manner. Your bike's shocks will compress as they take on the G-forces pushing your bike to the outside of the corner, then decompress again as you exit the turn. Tailing right behind another rider as you both weave in and out of chicanes is a sight to behold, to be sure.   One last thing that's carried over from Gran Turismo 4 is its Photo Mode, which certainly helps show off Polyphony's intricate detail work on the bikes. You can save a replay, head into the Photo Mode and snap images during a race, playing with things like shutter speed, exposure, aperture and so forth. Rendered images can be saved either to your memory card or a USB drive at 1280x960 resolution, which is nice for desktop images. Here's a set of images I snagged from my racing chaos to give you an idea of what's possible (I went for funny and extreme rather than artistic, obviously):              One really cool addition to the Photo Mode feature set is that Tourist Trophy can automatically run through the replay after a race and attempt to automatically extract the coolest photos for you. It'll sometimes take poor images, but 9 out of 10 are quality stuff, and it helps save a lot of time for people who don't want to dive all the way into the Photo Mode. You can definitely make better photos on your own, but this is a great shortcut. Cool stuff.   One last thing to note is that Tourist Trophy does indeed include the same 480p and 1080i support that was seen in GT4. It still has to switch to 480i anytime it heads to a menu, which is disappointing for those of us who use projectors and such that take time to switch between formats, but the 1080i signal is certainly much improved over either of the 480 variants.Tourist Trophy is a great first-attempt at motorcycle racing from Polyphony. The actual driving mechanic is fantastic, and the way that the game manages to instill the sense of speed, weight, stability and so forth from a bike is phenomenal. The single-player component isn't set up in an ideal manner, however. It's a cinch to run out and pick up some of the best bikes, so you never really get as much of a sense of satisfaction or ownership out of a new ride as could be. Still though, Tourist Trophy provides one hell of a racing experience, so if you're a fan of technical racing at all, you should run out and pick it up immediately.", "date": "Apr 4, 2006"}
