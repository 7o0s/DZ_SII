{"name": "Shrek", "name_review": "Shrek", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/11/20/shrek", "text": "Mario was the first, and Mario was the second... and the third, the fourth... pretty much every step in the platformer cycle. Nintendo only knows if Mario Sunshine will take the genre even further, but given the track record, one can only assume as much. Right now platformers are still following the cement foundation laid down by Mario 64, namely that they have a free-form structure, keep things in small missions, and leave it up to exploration, more than just fast action. Even Grand Theft Auto 3, for all its innovation, follows the major concepts laid down by Mario.  Shrek's no different. He may make Mario look like a cave painting in terms of detail and design, but he's obedient to the laws of Mario 64, down to the letter. Pick your level, complete six missions, two of which are the same collection goals every time (replace easter eggs with stars), and do a lot of punching and jumping. But is Shrek a dud in sheep's clothing, or does he manage to pull off Mario's charm? While still eating onions and farting, of course...  Gameplay Take Mario's levels and structure and put them in a living room, and you'll get the sense of Shrek. Shrek's beautiful... stunning... jawdropping at times, but the world he lives in is a playset when compared to most platform games. While titles like Banjo Kazooie have gotten so large that you need a subway system and a sports car to manage the floorspace, Shrek keeps things teeny tiny. The first few levels like Mother Goose Valley and the Sweetsville Industrial Park can be explored in a matter of seconds, though later levels like Prince Charming's Castle give you more hallways and areas to explore.  The goals, however, keep things as simple as the level structure. You'll find repeated versions of the same few experiences for the most part -- punch these items in a time limit, find certain items and bring them to a particular place, or the dreaded ~find these hidden items~ goals that plague all platformers, no matter how noble. You'll have to run and put eggs in a basket while Humpty chases you and them... and you'll have to run and put sheep in a pen while a wolf chases you, and them. You'll collect both eggs and fairies in every level. You'll fart on witches and punch them to win, and you'll fart on Jesters and burn them to win. While you're certainly repeating tasks in all platform games, Shrek's levels are so small and specified that these tasks are all you're doing in the game. There's none of the exploration or true puzzle solving of larger games, so all you're left with are these miniature experiences that refuse to satisfy.  It's not necessarily the repetition that makes Shrek so clunky, though it certainly doesn't help when you're farther in the game, and hoping for some new twists, but it's the way the goals are executed that keeps the game from every really entertaining. Some tasks, like bringing spiders back to their mother, are so ludicrously simple and brainless that you wonder why you're even bothering. Other tasks, like farting on the dancing cow, are easy in theory, but made complicated by the controls. Most tasks involve carrying objects over to specific places, and more often than not, having to kick them up to higher sections of the level -- a time consuming, and usually frustrating task. I think we all agree that the hunt and gather goals of games are usually are least favorite, and in Shrek they rule supreme.  The details show off the lack of overall design as well, such as trying to use the double jump to get to certain items. For younger gamers -- the main audience for a game of this type, there's little clue as to how you're supposed to navigate the environment. Getting to FrankenDrop on top of the Industrial park takes such an odd set of jumps that you'll swear that you've literally cheated yourself up there, using parts of the level that you're not supposed to. In Prince Charming's castle, you've got to knock out and carry Charming up to the Princess higher in the castle. Unfortunately, in an effort to make the game family friendly, nothing in the game dies, it just gets knocked out. So while you're trying to carry Charming up steps, you'll have to deal with rats, jesters, knights and other passerby, all of which continue to follow and attack you because they can't be killed. The lack of simple pleasures like a respawn of enemies instead of just a momentary stun make little goals much, much more annoying than they should be. There's a lack of polish that keeps Shrek from being truly fun, and unfortunately the problems lie with the actual puzzle and level design of the game as a whole as much as they do in the technicalities of your moment by moment experience.  The gameplay is made worse by what has to be the most complicated control scheme for a platformer in existence... other than Banjo Tooie, that is. There are separate buttons for punching, kicking, running, looking, belching, farting, jumping and grabbing, while most of the time you'll rarely need to combine controls, or do complicated tasks with those controls, leaving you wondering why these weren't combined into a smaller assortment of buttons. On top of navigating the controls, you've also got to keep track of the camera fairly regularly, a cumbersome task that makes exploring the levels even more work than it should be. There's no need for so much control over Shrek's actions, especially since most of your tasks involve simply punching things or throwing things, and it works against the game ultimately, creating more confusion where there should be none.   You'll be able to unlock new modes, like ~Race~ mode, but don't let the name fool you -- it's just the same levels as normal mode, only now you've got a time limit. If you didn't enjoy them the first time around, having a clock ticking over your head certainly isn't going to make them any more entertaining. The game flies by fairly quickly, actually so fast you'll be surprised you're almost done before you've even begun. The only thing that will keep you from beating this game in a couple of hours will be your lack of stamina, not the game's skill level. In its defense, however, there are a ton of cheats to unlock in the game that allow you to screw with the gravity, the look of the game, and the way the game plays, on top of just the standard invincibility and infinite weapon cheats you expect.  Graphics There's a reason why Microsoft used this game as their major graphics demonstration at investor meetings and major events -- it's stunning. If you can get beyond the small size of the levels, you'll be amazed at the details and layers on every object in the game. Zoom into Shrek's seemingly simple white shirt, and you'll actually notice that its ribbed and texturized. His face has individual teeth, and moving eyes. Cobblestone streets truly look like cobblestones. Grass, water, corn rows, bats, spiders... every single object is given an extra layer, a little touch of something. Beetles have shells that actually shine and reflect under realtime lighting in the crypt. Fireflies glitter in Mother Goose Land. Shrek farts on a knight... okay, not so much that one, though the gas clouds are nicely done, as well.  Stylistically, it can be a bit much at times, especially when everything around you has a sheen of bumpmapped, specular gloss over it, but it's certainly an instant example of the system's superiority over the competition. If there's a gripe about the game, it comes with the animation, which feels incredible stiff when in motion. Characters never quite seem to connect with the ground, and Shrek's jumping animations in particular don't quite match with how he actually moves in the environments. But those are details. Visually, you'll be bragging to your friends about the Xbox prowess, and using this as your benchmark for months to come.  Sound Sometimes you'll love the music in the game, like the dense, ~Munsters~ style graveyard romp that plays along through the Haunted Cathedral Grounds, and other moments will have you cringing at the MIDI landscape crumbling around your ears. Mother Goose Land in particular is a good example of how a bad score can make you cringe... but thankfully, there are great moments musically to wash the rougher parts down with.  The voice acting is a mixed bag -- Shrek's kept to grunts, though the grunts do sound Mike Myers grunt-like. The woman reading the stories that give you the missions for each level is straight out of your local library, and perfect in the part. Unfortunately, many of the side voices of the smaller characters sound like they've been plucked directly  from the programming staff, with little personality, and even less mixing. At times, it sounds like your friend is imitating voices directly into your ear -- badly. Sound effects, in general, are sparse and loud to sound fake, never quite fitting in with the environment, and rarely giving the environments an added body or life beyond what you see with your eyes. Visually, Shrek is a great example of what the system can do -- and that's part of the problem. Shrek as a game doesn't work, while Shrek as a tech demo is amazing. There's a lot going on in the game, from the constant use of realtime lighting, specular lighting, and bump mapping to the most ridiculously crispy textures you've ever seen... but that doesn't make a game.TDK's attempt to create a full fledged platformer comes off as clumsy, with controls that are much too complicated when married to the simplicity of the gameplay, and with a camera that works against you, rather than for you. The structure of the game quickly becomes repetitive, and more importantly, the individual goals of the game just aren't fun. Shrek may wow you with its beautiful visuals, but play around in his world too long and you'll find yourself longing for your TV and a copy of Shrek... the DVD.", "date": "Nov 20, 2001"}
