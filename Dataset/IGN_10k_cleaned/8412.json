The Soulless Army would probably be the highest scoring game in history. It as unpronounceable as it is long too, and isn't the kind of thing you'd fancy asking for down your local games shop.Still, you might want to start practising your pronunciation because Devil Summoner is actually worth getting, even if it means spitting in the face of the sales clerk when you ask for a copy. You see, out of the countless Japanese RPGs that have hit PlayStation 2 over its long lifetime, Devil Summoner is one of the few that has both interesting gameplay mechanics and a bizarre, twisting plot - even if it does fall into some of the same pitfalls that have plagued so many Japanese RPGs in the past. Elemental attacks are the key to easily winning battles. Things kick off in a familar way: as a mysterious character  named Raidou, you're tasked with saving the world from demons, through real-time battles and rescuing a kidnapped girl by piecing together clues. It's something we've seen (and heard) countless times before, but developer Atlus has ensured there are a few unique turns here and there.For starters, Devil Summoner is set in 20th century Japan, which gives glimpses of a country trying to modernise while at the same time trying to keeps its traditions. So although there are streetcars, telephones and guns in Devil Summoner, ancient Japan still permeates the atmosphere. This is largely down to the locals, who have a fascination about telling ghost stories, as well as some of the locations which include aging temples and ancient shrines.This combination of old meets new gives the game a fresh appeal, which is handy considering that for the majority of the game you're treading paths that have been worn by other RPGs. Levelling-up by fighting countless battles is familiar stuff, as is constantly purchasing potions and items, interacting with unhelpful non-player characters and a reliance on experimentation to find out what to do next.  The historical setting is one of the game's strongest points. But just when you think Devil Summoner has nothing new to bring to the table, it throws in a very pleasant surprise. Raidou can capture and summon demons he fights, and then use them in real-time battles against other monsters. Indeed, it's much better to use the power of these hellspawn in battle, because their magical attacks - which range from ice, fire and wind blasts - are much more effective against the monsters you face than the sword you carry.  Each demon has unique offensive and defensive skills, such as magic attacks and healing, although only one demon can be summoned into battle at a time. That said, you can swap mid-way through a fight, should you need a change of tactics.While calling upon the abilities of these demons is interesting enough in itself, Atlus has mixed it up even more by giving each demon an elemental affinity so they have varying strengths and weaknesses. Some demons have strong fire attacks but are vulnerable to water attacks (yes, much like Pokmon) and vice-a-versa, so players must learn how to get the most out of their demons rather than just wildly attacking.    Additionally, Raidou can take advantage of a demon's weak spot. If a creature is attacked using one of the elementals it's prone to attack from it'll become stunned, giving our hero a split-second to catch it, by getting in close and hammering the circle button. If successful, Raidou bags the demon and can use it in later battles. It's a compelling aspect of Devil Summoner that sets it apart from the majority of RPGs, because you want to keep progressing through the battles to see what crazy monsters you can catch next. Also, battling alongside new demons increases their loyalty, which enables Raidou to learn a range of special magic attacks that can then be used in conjunction with other demons.Demon capturing also plays another major part in the game. Hidden in the basement of an item shop is Dr. Victor, a Hammer Horror-style mad scientist who likes nothing more than experimenting with bizarre machinery. In his hideout you'll find a contraption that enables you to splice two demons together to create a potentially more powerful new creature to use in fights. There's also another machine that adds a demon's power to Raidou's sword, although you must sacrifice a creature to do so. Thankfully the result of any experiment is always clear before you hit go, so you won't make a mistake you later regret. It's a nice feature and the fusion factor adds more depth to a game that's already brimming with collectables. The range of demons available goes from bizarre to slightly more bizarre. The demons have one more use, too. Yes, they certainly like to multi-task. Their magical abilities can be used outside of battles to overcome obstacles or squeeze information out of the NPCs to further your quest. For example, some creatures can read minds whereas others can locate hidden switches or items. Unfortunately, while this a neat idea and it's clearly explained when you need a particular demon ability, it's particularly frustrating when you don't have said demon. This can mean lots of backtracking through the potentially frustrating random battles, just to try and capture the monster you need. At this point the game becomes a rather tiresome fetch-quest rather than an engaging RPG.Furthermore, the downside to all this demon-collecting and fusing is that you get stuck in a lot of random battles. Getting around different locations can be a real slog because random encounters are around ever corner. And as interesting as it is to control demonic creatures in fights, even this becomes tiresome when you're just trying to get somewhere quickly to speak to a particular person or find an item. During battles the demons make little quips and jokes. Cheeky devils. If Devil Summoner's story was more instantly gripping we wouldn't mind, but so much of the opening part of the game is devoted to explaining the mechanics of how things work there's little room for a decent plot. It's a shame because the narrative becomes much stronger as you progress and the mysterious and often macabre tale drives you through the random battles and tedious fetch-quests that often crop up.Worst still, if you're put off by the story, the graphics and forgettable sound aren't likely to pull you in either. Devil Summoner uses pre-rendered backgrounds, with low-detail 3D characters that seem to spookily hover on top of them. Also, considering the amount of people you're required to speak to during your quest, it's disappointing that there are no voice-overs. Still, the demons really are game's saving grace because each one is so visually different and bizarrely imaginative you just can't help but smile every time you see a new one - even if they are trying to kill you.Devil Summoner doesnt get off to a strong start. Visually its rather unappealing and the lack of strong plot to begin with could easily turn some people away. However, do so and you'd be missing out on one of the PS2s more interesting RPGs. The demons are certainly the stars of the show, making random battles seem almost interesting and adding a lot of depth to the gameplay with their elemental attacks and the ability to fuse them together. When the story does get going its genuinely interesting with a lot of twists and turns, all of which is helped along by the historical Japanese setting.", "date": "Apr 27, 2007"}
