I live!,~ referencing the phrase in a longer sentence like ~Beware. I live! Just the words bring back memories of gaming for thousands of...,~ or ending my article with the sentence ~and remember, Beware. I live!~ It's what we editorialists like to call easy bait, and I vow that I'll avoiding using the phrase that you'll probably hear on every other review of this game, and instead use the much more respectful and precise ~super-rad awesome awesome awesome.~ I've just finished playing a session of the original Sinistar, and every horrible death reminded me of exactly why I had a love/hate relationship with the game, and why I continue to play it despite how much it tortures me, mocks me, and pummels me. With Sinistar Unleashed, now I can finally move on. To 3D, at least. The pummeling, unfortunately, continues.  Unleashed builds upon the classic Sinistar formula without changing it drastically. Games have recently become a reflection of the movie industry, where every classic show or property has been revamped, but with a final product that seldom resembles the original. Even Hasbro's Centipede, which was for the most part just a 3D version of the original, still added adventure elements and a broader storyline to the beefed-up gameplay. GameFX figured (and rightly so) that the fans who played the original Sinistar didn't want fluff  they wanted flak. Sinistar feels immediately familiar to fans of the original, while adding just enough new features (and a completely new graphic overhaul) to make this feel now-dated.   The pacing is almost exactly like the original. You must stop the Distilled Evil and its slaves the Sporg from releasing its bio-mechanical monsters, the Sinistars, on your universe. This is mainly some quick fluff for some fast-action shooting, and once the game begins you'll forget all about that intrusive plot and get right to the action. Once a level begins, your job is to begin blasting asteroids into oblivion, and collecting the crystals inside. Yellow-tinged asteroids have extra crystals, while blue-tinged asteroids have power-ups that will help you in your struggles against the beast. While this is happening, you'll notice workers finding and dragging crystals, placing them around the Sinistar Gate. This is bad. As soon as crystals have been placed completely around the gate, the Sinistar will be released, and you'll quickly be dead. Launching Sinibombs (or as I like to call them, Cinnabons) at the gate itself will destroy the crystals and stall the Sinistar's arrival, as well as do some damage. The longer you keep the Sinistar at bay, the weaker it will be when it inevitably comes to eat your soul. The longer you stop the Sinistar, the more workers will come until you just can't keep them away from the ring  that's when it's time to grab as many crystals as you can, and get ready to destroy a boss.   The best thing about Sinistar was its complete lack of breathing room  there wasn't a moment in the game where you weren't frantically trying to survive, and for the most part, Unleashed keeps the same formula alive and well. Because of the 3D nature of the game, you have a little more breathing room when it comes to collecting crystals, but you'll still feel the classic heart rumble when you peek over and notice that the gate is full, and guess what? You've got no crystals. The level structure is identical to the arcade original as well, including a high score page, and a save game feature that punishes you for leaving a game before you've completely died. No in-game saves for you, Quake head.  New Weapons for New Sinistars  The Sinistar can only be destroyed with Sinibombs, so the key to winning any level is not just to keep it at bay for as long as possible, but to make sure that when it does arrive through the gate, that you're ready with enough crystals to do some damage. Each Sinibomb takes 10 crystals to fire, and you can only hold 100 crystals in your ship, which means that after frantically keeping it from arriving, you then have to frantically get crystals while dodging a big, giant monster of death. Don't expect to see the sneering face of the main Sinistar until the conclusion of the game  this time around, the designers have given you a whole slew of the bio-mechanical menaces to combat, all in an organic, bug/squid theme. Each one takes a different technique to destroy, and has a unique weakness that you have to discover before you can send it the way of the Dodo.  Fortunately, you've also got a slew of new weapons and powerups to aid you in battle. Your Sinibomb has been joined by a cutting laser, which will help you to break open asteroids quickly, and get to the juicy crystal center inside. Long and short range missiles help you to take out workers without wasting too much time, while the concussion and lightning guns deliver powerful blasts to enemies. Special are even more essential to survival, with boosters, cloaks, shields, and turrets helping you to stay alive, while gadget like the Crystal Depot help you to gather crystals much quicker.    The extra weapons are a nice touch, but more of a checklist than an actual asset. Get more than a few levels into the game, and you'll ditch using your extra crystals to bag some enemies, and use every Sinibomb you've got in an attempt to stop the next boss' arrival. The long and short range missiles can save you without causing you to lose too much time, but for the most part it's smart to stick with the Sinistar formula: grab crystals like they were going out of style at an outlet store, and bomb the portal until you want to cry. Very simple stuff.  Space  the Final Controls  The distances of space have rarely looked this good, especially because your environment is limited to a bunch of asteroids, a gate, and deep, deep space. Lighting effects power every moment of the game, from the pulsing colors of your ship (which also register your damage) to the brilliant green flares of the some of the nastier Sinistars. The ships all resemble insects, up to the tiny legs that the workers use to clutch onto crystals. The graphics are up there with any space fighter on the market, an unexpected plus to a game that didn't necessarily have to rely on top notch candy to support the gameplay. Unfortunately, the big drawback to Unleashed is that despite all the gorgeous graphics, the layout for each level is nearly identical. The GameFX team has pushed the environments to the limits, but the game itself just doesn't afford the sort of variety that a title like Descent: Freespace or Wing Commander can offer.  The music is background-worthy techno, but if you're playing Sinistar, that's not what you care about. You want a little bit of the uh and a little bit of the juh, don't you. You'll get as much as you want, in many flavors. Every character has its own signature voice, but still pushes the Sinistar nerve just enough to make you happy in ways you'd probably rather not talk about.  Controls are simple to get used to, and ditch realism for action, which is perfect. Aiming for the tiny workers can become aggravating with such a small reticle, but at least Sinibombs have a slight heat-seeking capability, which is vital for attacking some of the tougher bosses. Too bad you're only blessed with the quick controls if you're the joystick elite. Why, why the joystick problems? Unleashed has a very small set of joystick options, which means that unless you have a CH Products or Microsoft joystick, you'll have to go El Generico, which is fine, unless you want some force feedback on, let's say, your Logitech force joystick. That was me. Me was sad.  If this was aimed at a lower price-point, I'd be more enthusiastic about Sinistar Unleashed, but at around $45, this just doesn't provide enough variety or depth to satisfy modern gamers used to large, in-depth adventures. Fortunately, Sinistar does provide the closest thing to a plug-and-play gaming experience (except for the joystick configuration) without plug-and-play graphics in years. It's structured like the original, so it's more than safe to say that if you enjoyed Sinistar, you'll be pleased and pleasantly frustrated with the intense gameplay in Unleashed. And if you've been looking for an arcade-heavy title to give you a different experience from all the online RPGs you've been sucking away brain cells on, then this will keep you more than satisfied. Just beware. I  uh, just enjoy the super-rad awesome awesome awesome game.  -- Vincent Lopez", "date": "Sep 22, 1999"}
