This is not an uncommon practice in the games industry, and it's one we'd like to see fade away to an extent. But sometimes a fresh take on a old idea can make for a fun, if not familiar experience, as is the case with Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure. Is this a shameless milking of an already dried-out license, or is it a game that caters to a specifically different crowd and effectively brings the Tony Hawk experience to a new and more diverse audience? We'll go for the latter.   Gameplay  If you're going to rip off a skateboarding game, it may as well be Tony Hawk, right? Right. Now that we've established that point, it's safe to say that Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure is a Tony Hawk clone, only with a friendly Disney skin pulled over its head; running off a modified version of the Tony Hawk 4 engine, Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure borrows the well-known control scheme we all know and love, as well as the open-ended game structure found in the latest Hawk game. Basically, you're thrown into an environment and, by talking to strategically placed NPCs, are given goals to accomplish that eventually lead to unlockable items.   But this is a Disney game and that often means one thing: the game's aimed at a younger demographic. And as is the case with Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure, a few ~tweaks~ have been made to the gameplay to create a more accessible (for kids) game. Immediately noticeable is the control scheme - manuals are performed with the press of a button rather than the usual up-down/down-up method. Additionally, the flip and grab buttons are assigned to a generic trick that only varies when the obstacle does. For example, when riding up a quarter pipe and pulling off a trick, the same trick will be performed regardless of the direction pressed or even the button. And so, while the feel and physics of the Tony Hawk games is here, don't expect a full blown Tony Hawk game.    Not all is lost, though. Found in the options menu is a nifty ~Pro Controls~ option that more or less makes Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure play just how you imagined it should; grabs, flips, and grinds are assigned to the buttons you'd expect, and suddenly the repertoire of moves seems much larger than before. Manuals also revert (no pun intended) to the tried-and-true input method (though it's still incredibly easy to balance), as do, er, reverts and spine transfers. Essentially, Pro Controls make Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure the game you want it to be... almost.   A couple of things make this Disney romp slightly different than you'd expect. First off, though the Pro Controls help immensely with the gameplay, the number of tricks each character can perform is not as large as in the Hawk games. Where as in Tony Hawk each 8-way direction corresponds to different move, the number is literally halved, if not more so. Why? We're going to assume it's for two reasons: One, this being a ~kids~ game, ~kids~ don't need that many moves and it may confuse them. Two, because each move is hand animated (as opposed to motion captured), the time and effort it would have taken to throw in more moves could not be justified. Too bad for us, but a legitimate concern... we guess.   The rest of the game also feels like a simplified, toned-down version of Tony Hawk. Take the character creation for instance. While diverse and powerful in its own right, the number of options is still second to that found in the Pro Skater series. The same goes for your character's stats -- which feels like a much more condensed, easier to digest version of what you'd expect, and want -- and the number of worlds. So while this is ~Disney's~ Extreme Skate Adventure, only three of the respective worlds and corresponding characters are represented: Toy Story, Tarzan, and the Lion King. Not our first choices, but hey, does anyone really want to see a skateboarding mermaid? Don't answer that.   Actually, there is another world - Olliewood - that is the default hub world when you select one of the non-Disney characters. These characters are based on real child skaters who auditioned (just check out the intro movie featuring the lovely Lisa Fields) to have their likeness thrown into the game. While the characters, and the world, are a tad on the generic side and to an extent clash with the wonderful world of Disney, it's better than not having it. Really.    In case you haven't realized it just yet, this game plays very much like a Tony Hawk game. Yes, the number of moves has decreased, as has the difficulty, and the timing may feel a bit off due to some of the more outrageous and lengthy animations, but at heart, this is a Hawk game, albeit made for kids. Whether this is something that is beneficial to you depends on your age, your extreme sports games experience, or your love for Tony Hawk games.   Graphics  Like the Tony Hawk games, Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure looks good and runs well - but not much more. Don't expect the second, or even the third coming of a new graphics god. Instead, expect competent graphics that are true to their source material, and are friendly and inviting - perfect for the targeted audience. And as much as you'd like to have assumed that the game would be cel-shaded, it isn't. Rather, the characters are rendered using standard techniques, but still retain an animated look to them, thanks in no small part to the game's wonderful animations.   Honestly, there's very little to complain about the way Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure looks; it runs smoothly, animates just as well, and the models are accurate representations of their film counterparts. But there's also a lack of any defining or memorable effects/features to make the game stand out in an already overcrowded genre. The game looks good - just not great.   Sound  When we think Disney, we think of Elton John, Sting, and perhaps even Phil Collins. We do not think Reel Big Fish, Simple Plan, and Smash Mouth. But hey, that's exactly what we're getting in Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure. Now, we understand that it's a requisite to have licensed tracks in an extreme sports games (someone care to change this, by the way?), but any kid who listens to the mentioned bands is likely to be playing Tony Hawk, not Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure. While a Prefuse 73 remix of Hakuna Matata isn't quite what we're looking for, we're sure that some sort of compromise could have been made between upbeat tracks and familiar Disney theme songs.   Outside of the musical tracks, there's the standard boarding and grinding sounds -- nothing special in any way, shape, or form. It does the job and does it well, but that's about it. Woot.To fully appreciate Disneys Extreme Skate Adventure, you have to view it in the context of its intended demographic: kids. Taking that into consideration, Disneys Extreme Skate Adventure is one of the best examples of a game that appeals and caters to a younger age bracket while still maintaining a level of gameplay quality and intellectual decency lacking in so many other kids games. So what does this mean for you? Well, if you are looking for a nice and easy introduction into the extreme sports genre, youll be hard-pressed to find a better game than this. The same can be said for those of you searching for a game for a younger sibling or child; the intuitive controls and accessible Disney licenses are perfect for new and young gamers.On the other hand, if youre more experienced in the ways of Tony Hawk, theres very little new that youll find here. But thats not necessarily a bad thing, especially if youre a Disney fan. Buy it for your kids and rent it for your own pleasure.", "date": "Sep 3, 2003"}
