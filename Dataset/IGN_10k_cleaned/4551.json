From GTA to Hitman to, well, Mafia, the subgenre definitely has some high points and strong franchises going. So, naturally, other developers and publishers will want to get in on the action. Gangland takes a much different direction, in style, however, giving you an overhead, 3rd-person perspective, and differs in a few other ways.  Without turning this into a preview article, I'll just say that the major differences are that you'll be able to hire mercenaries, take over shops that will give you a regular influx of supplies, and use stealth (in theory) to sneak around enemy NPCs.  I say ~in theory~ because in practice, it's nearly impossible to avoid random enemies on your way to your target, especially when you're traveling through the territory of a rival boss. In fact, Gangland is probably the most bloodthirsty Mafia game I've ever played. Rival foot soldiers never hesitate to open fire on you, in the middle of the street in broad daylight. Ironically, they'll almost never bother you when you're indoors wandering around one of the shops they control, unless you open fire. In real life, it wouldn't make much sense for rival syndicates to be so homicidal. There's sort of an unwritten rule that you leave each other alone unless there's been an officially declared war, or so I've gathered from all the syndicate movies I've seen and the movies that must influence every develop who creates one of these games.  In Gangland, I can hardly get from Point A to point B without unleashing mayhem on the streets of the city, using up tons of precious bandages and ammo, and often losing an expensive mercenary (or two) along the way. Making matters even more delightful is when random citizens decide to get in on the action. While I can appreciate community policing, who's really going to walk into a gunfight with a Tazer or pepper spray? This is pretty aggravating because those two items will stun the target and keep them stunned while the citizen reloads her weapon of choice, thoroughly incapacitating one of my men (or women) while a rival soldier gradually chops them to bits.    Sound is pretty basic. The foreboding ambient music is actually pretty nice when things are placid, but when the lead starts flying, the gears shift over to some kind of thumping alternative metal number that's an acquired taste and takes away from the flavor of the mafia environment. Voiced dialogue consists of short, repetitive loops, most of them uttered by a henchmen every time you click on a destination. You'll have tuned out everything they say by mid-game.  As you encounter enemy street soldiers and they open fire, they won't take much trouble to run away when they're near death. They might walk off a bit and start to heal themselves, but at this point, they won't run away again when you close the distance and continue with the bloodshed. They'll just sit there and continue to heal themselves, not stopping until they're completely healed--an opportunity that won't come up since you're doing damage faster than they can heal.  Further complicating matters is the fact that your henchmen open fire freely in the street, which will attract the attention of any police officers nearby. Sometimes these officers move in large groups, headed by a station captain-looking guy, who's going to one of the syndicate headquarters for a periodic payoff. Well, he actually looks like the police chief, but that doesn't make much sense when you see more than one group of these guys. And even if you only see the group once per mission, that would mean the chief was doing nothing but going from safe house to safe house collecting payoffs.  So you have the roving enemy soldiers, beat cops, trigger-happy citizens, and topping it off is the suicidal team AI. The cheapest henchmen you can hire only do melee, and unfortunately they're more than happy to running into a hail of gunfire to do their melee thing. The big bruiser guys an take a beating and some of their hits will stun the target, but they're just not worth it in the long run. There will be times when you need to lob an explosive in order to get through in one piece, and your close-combat henchmen won't make evasive action. When you get below 50% health, you can only stagger anyway, not run. And some of the henchmen will randomly walk instead of run anyway, no matter how many times you double right-click, which spreads the group thin and is especially aggravating for timed missions. Making matters worse is the fact that you're not in complete control of your own character, who will also open fire on rivals unprovoked, even if there's a police officer standing right next to him. You can toggle auto-fire off, but this can make the character defenseless since there isn't actually a ~defensive~ mode, just a ~don't shoot back~ setting.      Speaking of timed missions, the ~ice the stool pigeon~ task is kind of painful. When you accept the mission (which you have no choice to decline, since all the missions must be done one at a time in a set order) two or three stoolies will pop up in generally random locations, and you'll have a few precious minutes to track them all down. A couple of them are usually close by, but the problem is that they take off as soon as you open fire, making it impossible to take them down on the first attempt. The stoolie will then run into a nearby building. When you approach the second time, the stoolie will make no indication that he recognizes you and will wander aimlessly like all the other citizen NPCs. Sometimes he or she will run into a shop controlled by a rival, so when you open fire, the rival guards will open fire, too. Add in a couple of helpful citizens with Tazers and it becomes a deathtrap. You can't simply throw an explosive through the window or doorway, since you have to be inside the building to see your target. You'll have to either wade back into the firefight or hope the stoolie comes wandering casually back into the open. The last stoolie is almost always on the other side of town, usually obstructed by a couple rival neighborhoods, so getting to him in one piece is more a matter of sheer luck than skill.  You'll also get a vehicle fairly early on. And you'll have to take good care of it, because the game is full of even more hazards in this situation. In addition to rivals opening fire on you whenever you drive by, the sidewalks are completely impassible and will eventually do debilitating damage to your car if you run into them enough. And the car controls are mushy enough that you can guarantee heavy damage by the end of the mission. In order to enter, you have to click-and-drag to highlight your men, right-click on the vehicle, then left-click on the car to actually control it. To exit, you hit the F1 key. The first vehicle also only holds two people, which is usually one or two fewer than you'll need.  However, it's disappointingly easy to have too many henchmen, as their horrible aim means you'll eat up your ammo supply in short order and be completely empty by the time you actually get to your destination. While their aim does improve over the course of the game, they start out shooting no better than boot camp cadets. You'd think if a guy was walking around packing heat all day, he'd be much better. The aiming problem is also problematic since your henchmen default to the maximum allowed distance for their weapon's range. So anyone with a shotgun is basically toast against three enemies with handguns or a Tommy gun.    The arduous difficulty of combat might not be so bad if you could save during a mission. As it stands right now, Gangland doesn't even do any periodic or geographical auto-saves, although Whiptail plans to introduce this feature in future patch. And since you have to do multiple missions before you progress, you'll be repeating the same street wars and car crashes ad nauseum. And because of this, I noticed certain dialogue issues. You'll have to go and talk to your boss to get to the next mission, but you can't simply click on the boss and automatically go to him. The context-sensitive dialogue icon is only available when you're within a few feet of the guy. And your character has his own loop of phrases, one of which is ~I oughta go talk to Vinnie,~ or ~Sal doesn't like to wait.~ This is kind of cool, except when he says this as he's talking to Vinnie. And I while I can appreciate the safety of discussing missions face-to-face in a secure location, it sure would have been nice to just talk to the contact from a payphone or something, to keep things moving.Gangland feels like a game that's still in the midst of development, with the underdone vehicle system, odd dialogue quirks, lack of auto-saves or manual saves and random violence. After playing games like Mafia and Hitman 2, there really isn't much I can recommend about Gangland. In addition to all the design issues, the visuals are all behind the curve, particularly the blocky character models. Instead of having a sort of cartoonish Warcraft III look about them, it just feels low-budget, especially since there isn't much of anything cartoonish or intentionally funny about the game. And although the game seems to advertise an empire-building model, it's far more about straightforward street mayhem and violently acquiring property for someone else. And while the world looks open-ended, it doesn't have the appeal of other games of its type that reward and invite exploration. With roving bands of syndicate soldiers on virtually every street corner, you're hemmed into your particular mission. Imagine GTA III with five times as many enemy gangs, and you're about there. There's too much unavoidable combat and other frustrations to make it recommendable.", "date": "Mar 15, 2004"}
