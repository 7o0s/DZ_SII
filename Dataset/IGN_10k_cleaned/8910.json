Cratermaze, well  maybe not. But being familiar with those first two is just the same as knowing this one, as Cratermaze is an in-house Hudson title from the TurboGrafx that plays just like a blend of those two other in-house Hudson titles from the TurboGrafx. It's a simple, accessible game design that's executed well and can be a lot of fun to play. But as there's nothing much here to set Cratermaze apart from several other similar games, you might be more likely to just pass it by.    Opi is the owner of a magic carpet spaceship. One day, while out on a joy ride through the stars, he and his friends are confronted by a minion of the despicable villain Zenzombie. The baddie kidnaps Opi's four companions, laughs maniacally, and disappears. The quest is on.   Opi has to adventure through 60 different mazelike levels in order to save his pals, traveling all the while through different environments and periods of time. You'll sometimes find yourself surrounded by buildings straight out of feudal Japan, while other times it's Jurassic-period scenery. But no matter the background, the goal is the same  grab that treasure.     Just like the Lode Runner, Opi has a dangerous obsession with gold. And, fueling his addiction, each level has several chests full of blinging bullion strewn about. You'll walk around the levels  each of them laid out just like the scrolling mazes of Bomberman  collecting the gold in order to make a key appear. Then, grabbing the key, the level-ending door will flash and allow you to pass through to the next challenge in line.   All along you'll be impeded by a variety of different enemies, and taking them out again takes a page from Lode Runner  you dig holes in the ground for them to fall into. You can walk over their heads when they've taken a tumble into one of your pit traps, or you can choose to finish them off by burying them with more dirt  choosing that option will net you more bonus points at the end of each stage.   It's all well and good, but it's all just so redundant. Cratermaze will leave you wanting more. There are power-ups and different weapons that temporarily alter your offensive capabilities, and those provide a mild distraction. There are a couple of boss battles that mix things up, but really only a couple  exactly two in the whole game. The Difficult and Expert difficulty settings add more enemies and restrictions, giving the formula a more energetic and frantic feel, but you're still left wanting more.Cratermaze just never finds that one key hook that makes it feel like a unique experience. And because it doesn't, it also doesn't leave you with much of an impression after you've finished  it feels like you've just finished playing another Bomberman or Lode Runner sequel from yesteryear, which it essentially is. If those are games you've found fun in the past, then you may want to consider Cratermaze  but most gamers will be perfectly fine letting it pass by, and saving those 600 Wii Points.", "date": "Aug 15, 2007"}
