Basketball isn't just basketball anymore. NBA Live is different from NBA Street and neither one of those is like March Madness. That's the formula that's worked for football and with the arrival of NCAA March Madness 2005, we see the college hoop franchise is really starting to take on an identity of its own. Outside of the fact that they're both basketball games, March Madness still has too much in common with the older NBA Live franchise for it to truly stand on its own just yet, but the maturity process is definitely underway.    The key marketing message for March Madness tells you to ~be the floor general.~ This is a concept that serious college hoop fans will be familiar with and the innovations thrown into this year's game certainly support it. The majority of things that set MM05 back are the same problems that prevent NBA Live 2005 from being all that it could be.    Gameplay   Being the floor general in the world of college basketball refers to the importance of the point guard and his ability to execute the gameplan the coach has drawn up. In March Madness 2005 you can call offensive and defensive plays on the fly using the D-pad. The key difference is that, on offense, you'll be able to see the diagram of the play you're running laid out on the basketball court in real time. Think of how Madden lets you see receiver routes when you lineup before the play and you'll get the idea. The system is extremely intuitive and should become a piece of cake when you watch the Floor General tutorial on the disk. The fact that you have the option of displaying the play diagram on the court when you call it is super important because when you're playing solo, you can actually learn the play and make it second nature before taking on a friend or hopping online.     This is a great way for novice basketball fans to become more informed plans since you'll actually be able to see and execute a High Post or Flex and you'll finally know what the hell it means when the point guard raises his fist as he comes down the court. It's not a tribute to Tommy Smith and John Carlos like you thought.  Now when Dick Vitale is on TV howling about picket fences and swinging the rock, you'll have an idea of what the hell he's talking about. While we're all for videogames as educational tools there's only one hitch about the play-calling/diagram system: the plays work too well, especially on the default difficulty. Shooters coming off screens, cutters flashing in the lane will be open 80% of the time and their subsequent shooting percentage gets a boost too. The players passing the ball will throw dimes and the receivers will catch every pass in traffic even at impossible angles. It's a tough line to walk for the developers because you want to reward players for learning the system, but veterans and those who live and breathe college hoop will be amazingly efficient very quickly. Long time basketball fans should definitely bump up to the higher difficulty settings right out of the box. Normally you should have to mess with difficulty settings to enjoy videogames, but in sports titles these days there's just no other way to please the greatest majority of people.    The AI in the game feels appropriate in NCAA March Madness 2005. In college hoops you're not dealing with as much talent like you get with an NBA team, but you're getting players who are more dedicated to executing a coach's wishes. College coaches on the other hand only want what they can realistically get out of their players. As a result the AI in MM makes it so big men can't shoot outside and little guys are not going to be dunking on anybody. You have to work the ball around on offense and switching back and forth between zone and man defense will force the opposition's hand. Now of course when you start talking about the powerhouse teams with superstar players, these basic premises go out the window. A player like Rashad  McCants can pretty much do whatever you  need him to do in any situation. Get in a tournament and Syracuse will always keep it close through sheer force of will. But for the other 100+ D-1 teams, success will come from keeping it simple and executing. Just like in real life.   Creating open shots is the challenge on offense, forcing bad shots is the challenge on offense. But you can feel the difference in how college players behave compared to pros. Pump fakes are more likely to get a skittish freshman up in the air so you can dribble drive and create a play. In the NBA, this rarely happens..at least not on playoff caliber teams. Blocked shots play a bigger role in college basketball and it's rare you'll see a player averaging anything close to double digit assists.  This is because height is still a big advantage at the college level and there's a lot more hands touching the ball when you're on offense. These two concepts are executed beautifully in March Madness 2005. Again this applies to the vast majority of the teams. When you've got Kentucky and UConn going at it, it comes down to your skill on the sticks not just the built-in swagger of the powerhouse teams.   The Dynasty Mode lets you negotiate the tough terrain of recruiting and maintaining a respectable basketball program. Through your PDA you'll get messages from your athletic director hounding you to stay on the recruiting trail throughout the season, your scouting staff notifying you of potential recruits and, if you get into trouble, the NCAA will let you know they've got their eyes on you. In a move that we want to see implemented into every sports game, you can actually use underhanded tactics to land talented troublemaker players. Sliding some tickets to boosters and getting help from family friends  to help in the acquisition of blue chip talent is a decision you'll have to make. Coping with that wild card player once he's on campus is another headache you'll have to deal with. Unlike NCAA College Football, March Madness is much stricter with its discipline system. You can't suspend a wayward player for a half of basketball for instance. You have to spend your discipline points to suspend for games at a time and the NCAA's interest in the cleanliness of your program may not budge if you don't do something drastic. Should the NCAA become dissatisfied with how you're running things, they'll start taking away your televised games and scholarships to show you they mean business. We never encountered the ~Death Penalty~ where you lose scholarships, TV games, tournament eligibility and the whole enchilada but then again that's become fairly rare in real life.     One of our favorite bits about March Madness is the real time timeout timer.  They get two minutes in the real life, but when you call a TO you get 30 seconds to make substitutions and call a play when the game resumes. This slight bit of real time pressure helps get you into the suit and loafers of a real college coach. Also, the College Classics allowing you to re-live some of the most exciting moments in NCAA history is a step in the right direction but needs some work. The Duke influence at EA Canada is obviously too strong because hitting Laettner's overtime shot in the '92 regional finals of the tournament is way too easy. To rub in on Kentucky fans, there's actually a man guarding the inbounds passer in this videogame. Nonetheless there needs to be more excitement and hoopla around the college classics, especially the shorter beat-the-clock scenarios like Kentucky-Duke in '92 and UCLA-Missouri in '95. Those were amazing moments that deserve crowds rushing the court, cameras shaking, slo-mo replays  and more bedlam, rather than just another made basket call from the announcer.    Ranking the toughest places to play and including a crowd pulse meter like we saw in the college football game from EA is not as cool without the player composure system. Who cares if you're down by 4 in The Pit with a minute to go if your freshman back-up point guard is just as focused as he was 30 minutes ago?   Graphics   The visual presentation is on par with what we saw in NBA Live and this is both a blessing and curse. The players skate around noticeably especially when you engage the turbo buttonand freestyle controls. The player models are well done too with no easily recognized players since it's college and they can't be marketed in videogames.    The details are in the uniforms and shoes you can unlock using Campus Challenge points. A whole line up of Air Jordans and other Nike kicks are available. This may be as close as we'll ever get to the classic pair of Air Jordan IV's we've always wanted. Also with no Create-a-School feature (a big surprise really) it was a relief to find the uniforms of our beloved UC Santa Barbara Running Gauchos accurate down to the ~SB~ on the shorts.    The arenas are well done as well even though there are a lot of generic ones used for the smaller schools. Cameron Indoor stadium and other well known houses are all accurately re-created with fans nearly hovering over the court on the sidelines or positioned far away in cavernous multi-use arenas.    Sound   Brad Nessler and Dick Vitale are your men on the mic and honestly Dickie V gets annoying a lot sooner when he's in a contained environment like a videogame. His commentary is well done and exactly what you'd expect from the former Detroit Mercy head coach so it's not really his fault..oh to hell with it. It is his fault! The bellowing rollercoasters up and down in volume depending on the situation but knowing Vitale is going to repeat the lines you've already heard a trillion times isn't a good feeling. Nessler is solid with the announcing as he moonlights from his job calling plays for EA's college football game.     The music in the game is a nice selection of recognizable hits from Papa Roach, Black Eyed Peas and The Trammps but the catch is they're all performed by college bands, not the artists themselves. Listening to a college band riff through rock, hip hop and funk using a whole lot of brass and kettle drums is a thrill in itself and definitely provides a change of pace from what you're used to.  It seems that a college hoop game is going to be for the diehard fan anyway so I think its important that March Madness continue to differentiate itself from the NBA franchise. Its going to be super tough to convince any basketball fan to pick up an NBA game, an arcade style game like Ballers or Street and then turn around and grab a college videogame too. There has to be a reason to pickup the third. I consider the 2005 game to be the first genuine step in that direction with the play-calling system and crowd meter, but theres a whole lot of work left to be done. It definitely feels more like a standalone college game now with more of the atmosphere, gameplay and extras that make NCAA hoops so endearing. The sticky dynasty mode is well on its way to becoming one of my favorite features too. Now if we can only implement betting and full-on point-shaving scandals.", "date": "Nov 19, 2004"}
