{"name": "RC Racer", "name_review": "RC Racer", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/10/17/rc-racer", "text": "Saturdays at the park with a radio-controlled car... ah, the memories. Now the hobbyist sport has made its way onto PlayStation courtesy Fox Interactive and UK-based developer Gremlin.  Real-world licensed cars from RC racing maven Team Losi (four initially-selectable, eight hidden) join a pack of decidedly unnatural courses, which range from the mushroom-covered ~Fungal Freeway~ to the streets of Chokey City, and, like the cars, there are plenty to unlock.  Pushing the realism envelope a bit further, the game makes use of a power-up system involving colored gates. Passing through one color will bring up another in the bottom left of the screen; pass through that color and you'll be rewarded. Team Losi RC Racer utilizes both sticks of the dual analog controller for the true RC controller ~feel,~ but passes on support for the Dual Shock vibration effect.  How'd it stack up?RC racing was always one of my most cherished childhood hobbies, so the prospect of reliving the experience on PlayStation was exciting to say the least. While I found that Team Losi RC Racer did do an excellent job of recreating the feel of driving the miniature off-road cars, it's significantly hampered by technical shortcomings, and proved rather dull in the end.Severe frame-rate inconsistencies interfered with gameplay more often than not (especially in the two-player mode) and the equally bad pop-up was very distracting. And while it was fun to drive the realistically controlling cars around the first few tracks, it became monotonous far too quickly.I'll give the game credit as a two-player experience; it's a good rental for when you've got a friend over. But as a single-player experience I'd have to relegate it to ~a good concept that fell short upon execution~ status. Still worth a rental if you've never played with RC racers, but serious fans will want to stick to the real deal.", "date": "Oct 17, 1998"}
