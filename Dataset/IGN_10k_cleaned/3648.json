Marketing departments everywhere are doing such a thorough job that it seems every other day, a new entertainment property emerges that is heralded as the be-all, end-all experience ever to grace a movieplex, television screen or concert stage. Usually, the ~new best thing~ cannot stand up under the weight of expectation.If the universal hype machine had never been fired up, perhaps folks would just sit back and enjoy their movies, games and music. But as it stands, everyone is expecting the most mind-blowing, orgasmic experience of their lives every time they sit in a theater or pop a game in their console or PC. The second Matrix film, The Matrix Reloaded has been playing to mixed reviews, partially due to the rampant hype that has been unleashed by the creators, media and fans. As the tagline states, no matter where you are, ~The Matrix Has You.~Enter Enter the Matrix. Developed by Shiny and published by Atari, it's the first full retail game ever to exploit the uber-lucrative Matrix license. It's impossible to know what kind of game would have to be shipped in order to avoid disappointment, but it's easy to see that Enter the Matrix is certainly not that game.Hype aside, it's a mediocre to average action title that incorporates cool elements of the film with a decent engine translated poorly to the PC to provide an experience that attempts to capitalize off of some of the more popular gameplay mechanics of Max Payne. What's more, the movie's creators went the extra mile to ensure that the game isn't a rehash of what played out onscreen in The Matrix Reloaded. Instead, the game follows the side-story of Niobe and Ghost and their missions within the Matrix to help the A Team (Neo, Morpheus and Trinity) succeed. There is a ton of exclusive content that was shot at the same time as the film that is inter-cut with the story. That alone is probably worth at least a trial from hardcore Matrix fans, and there are a lot of them in the world.LoadingPlayNow that you know how the game stacks up, why not find out which version is best? IGN Insiders have full access to our highly detailed comparison, including side-by-side screenshots, load time comparisons, and more! It's also complemented by a detailed Video Head-to-Head!Text Comparison | Video ComparisonEnter the Matrix is neither as bad or as good as everyone was predicting. It's good enough to hold your attention, and the fighting and bullet-time elements are very cool, but the game is also deeply flawed in many, many ways. Chalk it up to a development cycle that absolutely needed to put the game in stores by the release of the movie, but do chalk it up. Enter the Matrix is not all that it could be, but it is worth a look simply for what it is.When determining what absolutely needed to be included in a Matrix game, Shiny and Atari got about 70% of the stuff they should have, but completely failed when it came to implementing it. The acrobatic fight scenes and cool bullet-time effects are here in spades, but controlled and played out poorly. These two elements account for a lot of what made the films cool, and a lot of what makes the game bad. Slow-motion kung fu and bad-ass weapons lay the foundation for the action in both the films and the game, and it's as solid a foundation as any. The designers know a thing or two about their audience, and they knew that the fighting had to be great in order to sell this product. In terms of fun, it definitely can be. The fighting system allows for a lot of context-sensitive action, meaning you can use your environment to create attacks and movements seen in the movie. Unfortunately, the context changes with every jerk of the camera, inopportune mantling of a stack of boxes, and unwanted swing into fight mode, thus practically obliterating the kind of smooth, flowing action titles like Jedi Outcast (which offers up approximately 500% more/better combat) and Max Payne used to become so great.The focus system, which is the basis for all of these badly refined maneuvers, allows you to enter ~bullet-time~ (provided you have enough juice in your meter) and see your enemies in a sort of slowed-down reality. This effect is not new to video games. Max Payne and Jedi Outcast, among others, have used this sort of battle technique and have used it well.Enter the Matrix uses its bullet-time system as the bread-and-butter attack mode throughout the game. Does it hold up? Yeah. Ten hours in, it was still just as fun to vault off a wall and kick a baddie in the face as it was the first time. The camera intruding and making the experience far less fun than it could be, not withstanding. Even with camera issues, pulling out a machinegun and doing a cartwheel while firing is pretty exhilarating, and thus the Matrix allure can be appreciated. What's more, the moves are fairly easy to pull off (and well-explained through constantly updating tips), making even amateur gamers feel like action studs. Unfortunately, those looking for the most solid of mouse and keyboard controls are going to have their heads explode. Not only does the PC version of Enter the Matrix limit the options and force auto targeting and auto aiming onto players, it also just moves wrong, which strongly detracts from the pleasure of watching stylized action sequences unfold.The film that drives this game is (of course) engaging, to both hardcore fans of the film and the more casual dabbler. It stands on its own to some degree as a storyline, while adding to the overall meaning of Reloaded, which should be commended. While you can argue that the Wachowski Brothers haven't quite found their way as game directors, the movie portions of Enter the Matrix, in addition to the in-game cut scenes, prove that they know how to weave a good yarn. It's not quite the seamless presentation we see in titles like Two Towers on various consoles, but it's an excellent way to incorporate the believability and draw of the film into a game that sorely needs it.However, it's a little disappointing that the game does not allow you to play as the three coolest members of the Matrix universe: Neo, Morpheus or Trinity. It's nice that Enter the Matrix does not follow the same tired license formula of recreating a mini version of the movie within the game, but damn! It would have been cool to take off through the city as Neo, or shoot it out with agents as Trinity. How about giving Morpheus that samurai sword and seeing what he can do? Maybe that's being saved for the game that accompanies Revolutions? Maybe not.At least Enter the Matrix lets you explore the universe from a couple of different angles. You can choose to play as Niobe or Ghost, and who you choose determines the path through the story. Each character's adventure is different, and each emphasizes different strengths (you can go back and play as the other at any time). For instance, there is a car escape segment in the game. If you play as Niobe, you will pilot the car GTA-style while Ghost leans out the window and shoots at enemy targets. If you play as Ghost, the level will be on-rails, and your objective is to defend the car from attackers by shooting at things (easier with the mouse than with an analog pad). The dual adventures definitely extend gameplay, as you'll want and need to play it from both sides to see how the stories blend together.As for the driving and shooting segments, those are a mixed bag. The varying gameplay helps keep the hand-to-hand action from getting stale, but none of those sequences are as fun as running around tearing up a building in bullet-time. While it is fun blazing away with Ghost's gun and unlimited ammunition on the streets of Matrix city, the action is much better elsewhere. Still, it's nice to see that Enter the Matrix takes some chances and tries to mix things up, even though the result is a little lackluster.Also sub par is the level design. While this can probably be attributed to a truncated development cycle, nearly every area in the game has little pockets that feel ~off.~ There are tons of empty rooms where absolutely nothing exists, and it's all too easy to get lost in the endless chains of rooms, many of which look alike; then, there are the cleverly placed tables and boxes and corners that just obstruct action and prevent players from using their superhuman attributes to their fullest. Why?There is an intricate system of tips in the game, which is great for beginners, and helps you get a sense of control early on, but that won't totally help ease the agony of a sloppily built sewer system or airport. You can tell the game was designed with the mainstream gamer in mind, because at some point, every single puzzle is explained. Whenever you can't find your way for an extended period of time, the operator aboard your ship will help you navigate to the next objective. Open that door, stupid. If you trigger the advice of the operator (basically by sucking), tiny arrows point the way to the next thing you need to do. While this is helpful to give direction in some of the more drab environments, it can be insulting to gamers who know exactly what they are doing. At times, it felt like catering to the mainstream crowd that will invariably flock to this game detracted from the puzzle-solving and do-it-yourself elements.To perhaps balance this, Shiny included a cool Hacking feature for those who like to explore. Not only does it allow you to input cheats, but you can feel as if you're hacking through the game using a DOS prompt, sort of like how Tank and Dozer hooked up the construct and saw what was going on in the first film. While some of the things you can do are obvious, you can mess around with the feature and feel as if you're uncovering stuff on your own, which can be a pretty fulfilling feeling. Though, it should be noted that Morpheus does not talk to you, instructing you to follow the white rabbit.This game is a tricky one. While there are some serious problems in the gameplay department, the overall sensation while playing can be enjoyable. The game has the potential and the trimmings to be fun, but it's delivered so poorly and so unrefined that it's virtually impossible to consistently appreciate the ups without constantly being thrown to the floor by the downs. It's a pop tart game. It may not be a gourmet meal, or last very long, but it does taste sweet while it lasts provided you eat around the burnt edges. Anyway, with the competition in mind, can Enter the Matrix hold a candle and be seen as strong in terms of straight play? Not really.Early in the development cycle, there were concerns that Enter the Matrix wouldn't get anywhere close to the slick feel of the film. While the gap narrowed between then and now, it never fully came together. Throughout the game, the color palette is a dull, almost sickly green, with a few muted grays thrown in for spice. That would be fine (as the films' palettes are not that much broader) if the textures throughout were good. They're not. They vary from polished (the marble in some of the larger indoor sequences) to pretty bad (some of the rock and concrete effects outside).Luckily, the character models are fairly well rendered. From the hair (especially Niobe's), to the faces, to the flowing trench coats, these characters look pretty real. That's important, too, because they need to compete against the real thing in live-action cut scenes. Still, don't expect DOOM lighting, don't expect sprawling environments (loads are frequent and relatively short), and don't expect perfect physics and collision detection. But, if passable is good enough, than this does the trick.For the most part, the actual character animations, once they run, are cool. That is, when they are kicking butt. When just moving through the environment or transitioning from one animation to another, they look stiff and robotic (the fence crawling is atrocious). Although the walking (useless) is nice, the running scheme is laughable. Why are these people always sprinting T2 style everywhere?Maybe the smooth framerate will save it? Nope. This games runs bafflingly bad. On our 2 to 3GHz test systems with either Radeon 9700s or even top-of-the-line GeForce 5900 cards, this game ran so poorly that it seemed almost pathetic, especially when compared to graphical wonders that aren't even out yet and still manage to run nearly perfectly on our machines.The biggest problem with the graphics, however, is the utterly abysmal, ~we didn't bother to take notes from any other game in all of existence,~ camera system. While it does do some nice things, like pulling out to display a one-on-two fight from the side to incorporate all of the combatants, too often it gets stuck behind objects and walls, and generally struggles to keep up with the action. Add this to mouse look and you're in for some seriously glitchy pain. Any developer will tell you that a good 3D camera is one of the trickiest things to pull off, and it wasn't pulled off here.You'd think the old free looking mouse would help this horrid camera and be the gunpowder that would propel our version far beyond the console ones. Quite the contrary, it actually takes all of the camera problems of those iterations and amplifies them by a factor of 100. It's ridiculously bad. The cursor is pointless, the auto lock/auto target system is always on and always debilitating, and the whole thing feels so completely broken that nearly five year old games like Heretic II pretty much laugh in this piece of crap's face.At least the effects are top-notch. As in the films, bullets fired while in focus create ripples in the air (more like wavy streams than ripples here). In addition, when you hit a target and knock it to the ground, a green burst of code floats into the ether (after the style of binary code that streams down to represent the Matrix). These two effects help to link the game further to the films, and look pretty darn cool, too.One of the handiest things about having a great movie license like The Matrix is that the game music can be lifted directly from the film. Too often, however, game designers get lazy and don't use music correctly. That isn't the case with Enter the Matrix. All of the dramatic fight music is employed here, and it's almost always applied well. There's something satisfying about kicking ass in slow-motion as the awesome score from the first film punctuates the action. The blending of one passage of music to another is handled fairly well throughout, although there are a couple of moments where the music simply stops, then resumes.The aural goodness doesn't end at the score, however. This is a sonically rich game, especially if you have the setup to appreciate it (Audigy 2 and cranking speakers/headphones). The sound effects from the film are brilliantly captured here, including the agent-morphing effect, and the Matrix-drizzle effect (for lack of a better term).Special attention has also been paid to getting the gunfire and explosions sounding extra-delicious. There are definite differences between the cadences of the guns. Beyond that, the echoes and ambient noise surrounding the hail of gunfire (bodies being hit, tiles exploding, etc.) sound absolutely amazing.How has your trip into the Matrix been?Also quite magnificent is the difference between real-time sound and focus-time sound. The ~underwater~ sound of focus is similar to the sound of bullet-time in the film, and it is a glorious sensation, indeed. The transition between real and focus time is also quite keen. Don't believe me? Your system isn't loud enough.It all comes with a price though. This isn't surprising, considering all PC games have the ~good as your hardware~ label stamped onto them, but unless you have the solid card and the solid speakers, you're not getting much. If you do have that Audigy 2, you'll be able to experience some truly cool ear pleasing noise.Enter the Matrix has a lot going for it -- a lot to appreciate, a lot to respect, and a lot to enjoy. While you're desperately reaching out to hug the bits of joy you're unfortunately being beaten over the head by an onslaught of bad. It's impossible to think that in light of such mind-blowingly cool titles like Max Payne and Jedi Outcast, this game could be made, and be made so, so much worse. The action, from top to bottom, may be built on a foundation made of stylish maneuvers, cool martial arts, and slick gunplay. But when you try and jam all of that into a poorly performing beast of a game with some atrocious mechanics and an utterly agonizing camera, it just loses most of that appeal.Most.In the other ways (sound, presentation, story delivery), Enter the Matrix excels, but again not without slamming on the brakes every so often to remind us all that this is nowhere near perfect and indeed far from complete. It's like a taste of desert with the promise of ice cream on cake, but all you can do after the taste is smell the joy of the cake while you cram asparagus into your mouth.The fundamental flaw with this game is that it looks and feels unfinished, from the unpolished textures to the bad camera and sparse level design. The fact that the game had to ship at the same time the film was in theaters was an economic decision, and unfortunately, that compromised some of the quality. It happens all the time. But no one wants it to happen to the game based on movies they love.That said, it's worth a play to see the extra footage and experience the bullet-time and focused hand-to-hand combat. At times the game makes you completely forget its flaws and hone in on the joy of creative carnage. The first time you pull off a spinning kick off the wall and land by cartwheeling between two enemies and gunning them down with an automatic rifle, don't be surprised if a smile creases your lips. If only the whole game was able to capture the fun inherent in the few smooth fight sequences, it would be a true masterpiece. If only I could fly like superman, wave Harry Potter's magic wand, and date a supermodel.", "date": "May 21, 2003"}
