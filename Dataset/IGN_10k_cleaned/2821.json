{"name": "In the Hunt", "name_review": "In the Hunt", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/25/in-the-hunt", "text": "There are some pundits in the game industry who believe that if a certain type of game does well, any other game along the same lines should do equally as well. And while this is an admittedly simple view on game-making decisions, it stands to reason that a lot of bad games get made because they resemble a better one.  In The Hunt was made by the fine folks who made R-Type, a great shooter if ever there was one. Sadly, In The Hunt doesn't even come close. The basic premise is the same - travel from left to right, destroying all obstacles in your path (and believe me, there's a lot of them). The only thing that separates this title from R-Type is you pilot a submarine, not a spacecraft. Oh yeah, and it's terrible.  The game's major flaw isn't the graphics. The sheer number of sprites on the screen at any given time can be staggering, but it still looks great. It's that darn sub - it moves way too slow. This, coupled with the lack of originality, is enough to frustrate even the most adamant devotee of shooters. Still, a small number of people enjoyed this in the aracde, and for them, this delivers.", "date": "Nov 25, 1996"}
