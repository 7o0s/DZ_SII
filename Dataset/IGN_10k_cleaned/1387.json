They're plentiful because that's where the system's strengths lie -- but it's also a good benchmark for developers because it shows how competent and creative they are with specific spins on the genre. Ubi Soft already proved itself with a very cool portable port of its Rayman property, and it's obvious the team responsible for that conversion is responsible for this Disney licensed adventure, Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers. FeaturesFour worldsPassword SaveMultilingualOnly for Game Boy ColorThe game itself is loosely based on an N64 platformer still in development. In Goin' Quackers, Donald's girlfriend has been kidnapped and it's up to our half-nekked fowl-with-an-attitude (and not the ~cool~ kind) to head through the land to rescue her, as well as defeat the evil Merlock. Problem is, the machine that'll send Merlock back to his own dimension is busted, and it's up to Donald to collect the scattered blueprints in each level to send the bad guy bye-bye.It's clear that Ubi Soft designed this game for the young ones, for there isn't much in the way of complicated controls or puzzles. After all, we don't want to let the kiddies get stuck in a level because of an annoyingly difficult level design or a series of button pushes for a single move, do we? Donald only has a jump, a double jump (a la Yoshi in Yoshi's Island and Yoshi's Story), and a Hyper mode that's activated with a specific power-up. That's pretty much it. He can jump on enemies to destroy them (platform  clich Number One) as well as climb necessary ladders, ropes, vines et al, but he's not Mr. Versatile, that's for sure.But what's here is absolutely gorgeous, and actually a lot of fun to explore. The attention to detail in the character motions is stunning -- Donald's got a lot of frames of animation to his movements. The game's not a one-hit wonder, and Donald's health is indicated by his visible mood -- if he gets nailed once, he'll get all cranky in his walk. The backgrounds are just as beautiful, from the trees in the jungle to the buildings of Duckburg. The game's a four-megabyte monster, and it shows in the colorful details given to every aspect of the graphics.The downside, though, is that the game is very, very short. There are only four overall worlds, and it's a snap to breeze through the first half in an hour. To combat the length of the game, the designers threw in the blueprint collecting, and players won't be able to get the final ending without having blueprints to all the levels. If you didn't collect all of them, you have to go back through the levels and snag 'em all. On the plus side, some of the levels have clever puzzle elements hiding these prints -- you have to do a lot of backtracking to find a platform that was triggered by collecting the plentiful blue orbs thrown around the worlds.I've said it before, I'll say it again because it's true -- platformers are a dime a dozen in the Game Boy market, and that will never change. It's a genre that can make or break a series,  and when it's done right you've got a classic on your hands. Goin' Quackers is a very clean, very beautiful, very tight playing game, but there's not a whole lot to the design. It's a quick adventure if you play through it mindlessly, but it's a challenge to get through with every bit of blueprint grabbed. It's for the younger crowd, so keep that in mind. But Ubi Soft gave the game to the right development team -- can't wait to see what these guys are capable of in the Game Boy Advance generation.", "date": "Oct 24, 2000"}
