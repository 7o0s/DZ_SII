And not only tackle, but also conquer. As much as I am surprised by this, I believe we have found Gameloft's Achilles Heel: pinball. This is not a blanket condemnation of Mystery Mansion Pinball, because it is not a terrible game. It's just an oddly ~okay~ one, and ~okay~ has never been a word anybody would use to describe a Gameloft title before.   Mystery Mansion Pinball decorates a classic-style pinball table with all the trimmings of a deliciously cheesy horror movie -- think more of Hammer and Vincent Price than today's modern brand of horror, like ~Saw~ or ~Jeepers Creepers.~ Frankenstein's Monster adorns the left side of the screen, an Elvira-esque vamp is perched at the top of the table, and ghosts blink to life along the right ramp. Production-wise, Mystery Mansion Pinball is a scream. The colorful, detailed table lights up like it's about to pay out in silver dollars.   The very top of the screen is reserved for the LED strip you often find above a typical pinball machine. Normally, it just tracks your score and lets you know how many balls you have left, but it also reels off in-game challenges, like ~What's Behind the Door?~ and ~Destroy the Moon!~ It also hosts mini-games if you satisfy specific requirements and dump a ball down Frank's windpipe. These mini-games include a ~find the key~ challenge, not unlike an old shell game, as a rhythm game where you have to press the flippers like a Dance Dance Revolution contest. Hit enough arrows and you bring Frankenstein's monster to life -- and earn a mega-bonus.   Speaking of bonuses, Mystery Mansion Pinball is a high-scoring game. I liked the within a few games, I was handily getting over 50,000,000. I hate video pinball that keeps slapping you down with paltry 12 mil scores. I want a pinball machine that goes full-tilt and lets me, a casual player, just have a good time.   However, there are a few things that work against Mystery Mansion Pinball's charms. Namely, the ball physics are kinda wonky. I played the game on a supplied K700i. There were times when the ball would just sort of ~hang~ in the air for maybe a half-second, and not at the top of an arc, either. This was when it was coming down the table, or just getting bounced off a bumper near the flippers. Also strange: The ball would ~warp~ through the flippers. I would be jamming on the flippers to save a ball, but the ball would slip by -- I could clearly see it beneath the up-turned flipper, but in the next frame of action, the flipper would be down and the ball above it. Hmmm.   Another thing which threw me off: Multiball. This is always one of my favorite parts of pinball, when you have to juggle a handful of silver balls. For a hardcore player, this is a careful ballet. But for me, it's giddy chaos. Now, because the table is long, the screen in Mystery Mansion Pinball scrolls up as the ball moves into the top-half of the table. In fact, there is a third flipper up in the top half of the board. And you use that flipper a lot to meet challenges in the top of the table, such as interacting with the moon.   But if you get one ball in the top part of the table and another in the bottom, the camera only shows the bottom half of the table. You are completely unable to finesse the entire machine -- it's all guesswork with the third flipper. You pretty much have to write off pursuing any exact ramps or bumpers on the top, because you can only see the flippers at the bottom. I'm not sure what the solution would have been in the case of Mystery Mansion Pinball. Maybe excise multiball altogether? But how many pinball junkies would that disappoint?   These things detract from the overall package, and I just had a hard time getting around them. I think a lot of other players will share in the frustrations, too.  As stated, Mystery Mansion Pinball is by no means a bad game -- but it's one with potential for greatness cut short by some frustrating problems. Video pinball games need to have solid ball physics to succeed, and when you have warping ball or frozen trajectories (even if for just a second), it throws off the whole thing. It's unfortunate, because otherwise, Mystery Mansion Pinball has a lot going for it. The design is fantastic. I love the B-movie theme, the LED mini-games, and the sound effects. I just wish there was more refinement to the stuff going on behind the scenes.", "date": "Jan 13, 2006"}
