Sure, there are those who fit snug in the middle, but for the most part, there's two distinct demographics here, and game companies are well-aware of this. Every once in a while, though, a game such as Starcraft, Half-Life, Rainbow Six or EverQuest will appeal to both groups, but these are rare exceptions.   That said, if you consider yourself a serious diehard player, please do not read on. I think there's a review of Firaxis' Antietam! around here somewhere or something. But for those of who enjoy the more ~mainstream~, ~lighter~ or ~budget~ games (or believe there's a place for them in the PC gaming industry  I for one, am of this opinion), read on brother because it's a huntin' time again...  Deer Hunter 3: The Legend Continues is the latest incarnation of the best-selling (and record-breaking) franchise from Wizard Works and thankfully, there's quite a leap between its predecessors in light of gameplay, graphics and multiplayer support.  For the uninitiated, the premise behind these virtual hunting games is fairly straightforward: the goal is to hunt game with a wide selections of weapons and by using gear such as buck and doe calls, cover scent, deer bait, and often a hearty dose of patience and luck. Bagging the biggest buck for bragging rights (now, that's alliteration, folks!) is always the ultimate objective as the animal's head will be proudly mounted on the wall in your cozy den or lodge, complete with a crackling fireplace. Alternatively, you can upload it online to many of the fan sites to compare who's is bigger (men will be men!).  In Deer Hunter 3, the game engine is completely new (unlike Deer Hunter 2) and fans of the first couple games in the series will see this change right off the bat. First of all, it's now possible to move around in all directions, using a Quake-like keyboard and mouse interface and familiar first-person perspective. Electronic Arts' Deer Hunt Challenge also opted for this open-ended, and welcomed, freedom. Secondly, the graphics are much more detailed than ever before. 3D accelerator cards are optional (but recommended), which add much more realistic environments, hunters and animals. Translucent water flickers in the sunlight (exposing schools of fish), while dragon flies and leaves drop from trees. Lastly, gamers can now use a variety of accessories to aid in the hunt, or even cooler, a number of vehicles such as motor boats, snowmobiles and trucks! I must admit, it was pretty cool to catch a deer wading in the water as I took the boat over to the other side of the pond to get a cleaner shot. Unfortunately, I scared him away in the process...  Gameplay modes have also been beefed up considerably. There is still the self-explanatory ~Quick Hunt~ option to dive into a few locales (with customizable seasons and equipment) but the real solo-player fun is in the new ~Season Mode~. For the first time in the series, gamers can hunt an entire season with the aid of a calendar which tells the dates that are open for hunting and what methods are allowed. If you don't bring your hunting tag or follow all the local laws your precious catch will be poached from the Trophy Room. Seasons change over time, as does the deer's behavior.   Another first in this series is the multiplayer option, and it's quite robust at that. Gamers can hunt against other online players in the competitive mode (up to eight players maximum); the person who bags the biggest buck in the shortest amount of time, wins. There's also the option to play cooperatively, with two deer hunters roaming the digital landscapes alongside one another. Players can chat during gameplay or use any of the pre-set audio commands such as ~hey, did you hear that?~ or ~I'll call -- you shoot~. I found this to be most enjoyable. There was very little lag/latency for the most part and proved to be a fun experience. Wizard Works also inked a deal with GameSpy to effortlessly find games currently played over the Net with low ping times.   As a side note, fan of these kinds of games should check out Planet Deer Hunter  it provides real-time chat rooms, tournament information, a trophy room showcase and downloadable map editors to create all-new, custom environments.  But before you run out and pick up Deer Hunter 3, there are a few downsides to consider. For one, if you play the game out of the box, there are a few technical snafus the gamer may experience. OK, so it's not nearly as bad as Ultima: Ascension (is there anything as bad?) but I'm disappointed to report players are urged to download a 10MB patch (for full install) or a whopping 20MB patch for minimal install to bring it up to version 1.30. Then, there's another 1MB patch to bring it up to 1.31. Sheesh. These patches fixes many multiplayer quibbles, 3D sound issues, video card incompatibilities, deer freezing, game crashes, Y2K season mode issues, and more. Can you say rushed out the door?   Another minor drawback is there's only one weapon allowed per hunt. OK, so I play a lot of Unreal Tournament and Quake 3: Arena and want a full arsenal of toys to annihilate the wildlife...  All in all, though, fans of this genre will definitely feel Deer Hunter 3: The Legend Continues offers the most bang for their buck (couldn't resist the pun). However, the system requirements are pretty steep  especially for a value-priced budget title  and a helluva patch must be downloaded before you dive into the game, so be sure to have a high-speed connection or get a program that resumes downloads such as GetRight.   --  Marc Saltzman If you have a serious interest in hunting, Deer Hunter is a right good way to pad your phone bill. The ~art~ of tracking bucks and dropping them is as faithfully recreated as this generation of cellphones will allow. However, if you find the sport abhorrent or just don't see its draw, take a pass. Deer Hunter isn't going to make a convert out of anybody who wasn't already pulled in by the popular franchise years ago.", "date": "Mar 16, 2000"}
