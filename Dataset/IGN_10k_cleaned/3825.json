The early highlights like ~X2~ and mid-season hits like ~Pirates of the Caribbean~ have given way to a few last-minute stragglers like ~American Wedding.~  And thus endeth another summer of movie-licensed games.  Thank your preferred diety, because we had some real pooptacular cash-runs funneled into our handsets over the last couple months.  Can Activision's X-Men 2: Battle help us end the summer on a positive note?  Maybe wash the bad taste of Fury of the Hulk from the collective mouth?  Features: Fighting game Play as Storm, Wolverine, or Nightcrawler Follows plot of movie... sorta Hidden XBox/PS2 game hints  Now, up to this point, fighting games haven't really had a good run on handsets either.  So, forgive us if a movie-licensed fighting game doesn't exactly causes our trousers to tingle.  But to be fair, we set aside some awful pre-conceptions when we downloaded the Mforma-programmed X-Men 2: Battle into a Motorola T720 for a good test run.  And we'll be damned if it didn't suck.  And not just that, but we were decently entertained!  X-Men 2: Battle is a very simple fighting game, bearing none of the super-move, complex strategies you need to master to survive today's 3-D fighters.  In fact, you only have one real attack button, and then a single super-move, which is unleash by a pressing just one button.  Perhaps this was the best strategy for Mforma, as the typical audience for a celly game is likely not to possess super-human Street Fighter skills.  You start out choosing between Storm, Wolverine, and Nightcrawler.  Now, before you go getting all Weapon X on us, know that Storm is probably the strongest, most playable character in the game.  Wolverine actually posed a bit of a challenge, getting him to properly strike out against his enemies.  As for Nightcrawler, he's somewhere in the middle, which is too bad -- as he was the coolest character in the movie.  The circus freak witht he heart of gold deserved more TLC.  The game roughly follows the story from ~X2.~  A mutant has atttacked the President, and Professor X charges you with stopping that mutant, warding off Deathstrike, and finally preventing Magneto from killing Stryker.  Between each fight, you get a little mini-story screen to push the tiny tale forward.  Nothing special, but at least they try to spin a plot.  In addition to just punching or thwacking your opponent, you can also use your special Mutant Powers.  Storm calls down lightning, Wolverine goes Berserk, and Nightcrawler disappears and reappears within a flurry of blows. Your foes also possess Mutant Powers, too.  Magneto will use his magnetic grip to trow girders at you.  They can be avoided by jumping.  Actually, according to the instructions, all Mutant Powers can be countered and stopped, but while the computer seemed to have an incredible knack for dashing our super-attacks, we'd have easier time convincing you that ~Charlie's Angels 2~ was a good movie before blocking the computer's super moves.  Control is probably X-Men 2: Battle 's biggest stumbling point, as those with big fingers will likely have a tough time using the touch pad properly.  Several times we tried to attack by pressing forward, but ended up jumping, which is done by pressing up.  Sigh.  The over-simplicity of the controls also means that you'll likely have an easy time blowing through the quick game -- we finished off Deathstrike by just pressing attack over and over, never ducking or guarding.  X-Men 2: Battle  doesn't really look that bad.  The mutants are recognizable, and reasonably detailed for a handset game.  The backgrounds are good, and straight from the movie, such as the room where Deathstrike met her maker and the frozen wasteland where Magneto tries to deal a little death to Stryker.  However, X-Men 2: Battle  possesses one Casio of a soundtrack.  Zzzzzz... punches sound like short organ blasts.    X-Men 2: Battle turns out to not be the disaster we expected.  In fact, it's probably worth you cash if you're a huge ~X-Men~ fan, or a fan of the movie.  You may find yourself slightly discouraged by the dismal length of the game -- a mere four stages.  But at least there's a groovy goody at the conclusion of the game: cheat codes for the console games based on the movie, X2: Wolverine's Revenge.  Too bad in order to use those codes, you actually would have to play that game...", "date": "Aug 6, 2003"}
