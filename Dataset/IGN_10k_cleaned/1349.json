Not surprisingly, nitpicking old fogies just don't like to see their favorite standbys get a facelift. Given the freakish post-surgery results of Q-Bert, BreakOut, and Galaga: Destination Earth's stay at the development clinic, it's easy to sympathize.  Yet in a miraculous twist of fate, the gang at Blitz Games refused to let their attempt to revamp a classic suffer such indignities.   Gameplay Consider, if you will, the all but idiot-proof interface.  A lone tutorial  stage suffices to school the average punter in the ways of the frog.  As in  the venerable arcade game, all one has to do is hop around, one square at a  time, without landing on some nasty critter or object that's baneful to  their existence.  Commands have been newly added for tongue swipes (which  grab butterflies for points and power-ups), croaks (used to locate kidnapped  toad toddlers), and double jumps.  Ultimately, though, this is in principle  the same title aging punk rockers used to dump bags of quarters into in lieu of  Joust or Defender.   Nostalgia value can only take a product so far, however.  This title's  manufacturer knew better than to completely retread old ground and has  accordingly used the past as a foundation upon which to build an all-new,  damnably addictive adventure for the hero.  Fantastic level design work's  the ticket.  Stages rely on the base concept discussed earlier, but parlay  this simple play mechanic into so many different scenarios that it boggles  the mind.  As Frogger or Lillie, the green machine's ball and chain, you'll  have to surmount an astounding array of obstacles.   At any given point a member of the duo could be in just about any  imaginable situation.  Perhaps they're running from killer beetles or  weaving through a gauntlet of booby traps.  Fast forward five minutes and  the scene might shift to an Indiana Jones style boulder chase or a race  across a ramshackle wooden bridge that's collapsing into a bottomless chasm.   Give it another few seconds and massive grinder gears, wild mind cart  rides, streams of ants, or razor sharp lawnmower blades may well take center  stage as the lethal danger(s) of choice.  Five levels in, it becomes obvious  that a wealth of content's introduced with each passing scenario.   Furthermore, the difficulty setting is whatever you make of it.  Impatience  gets people killed more frequently than environmental hazards.  Cobra-like  reflexes can save a hyperactive player only so often.  The rest is up to the  oft forgotten virtue of patience.  And knowing that Frogger lives or dies as  a direct result of your actions can be intoxicating.  Hence the reason folks  are sure to be spending hours on end repeating the same stage over and over  until it's won.  Apparently frustration and disappointment are the ultimate  motivators.   But there won't be an abundance of sleep lost over the issue.  Since the  story mode sliced into chapters, with games saved at the beginning of each,  it isn't necessary to start from scratch after death.  This limits the  challenge somewhat, although not fatally.  And even when you're finished  with the single player mode, there's a great four player option to look  forward to in which participants scramble to rescue baby frogs and claim the  most points.   Graphics There's no shortage of slick visuals either.  Although comparing Frogger 2  to something like, say, Gran Turismo 2 is out of the question, the title's  still a looker.  To break it down, this game artfully manipulates the third  dimension to best effect.  As movement goes, sometimes it's horizontal, at  other points vertical, and occasionally towards the screen itself.   Regardless of which way the frog's headed, he appears to be enclosed in a  vibrant 3D world composed of robust, brightly colored textures.   While the action unfolds on a linear path, it's hardly a letdown.  Players  have the freedom to explore a limited area, though each zone's packed with  so many spectacles that this becomes a minor issue.  Realistically animated  obstacles (well, as realistic as cartoons are going to get) and humorous, if  low resolution, cinematics further spruce up the decor.  Player hate if you  must, but the varied terrain, elevation modeling, ephemeral bursts of  colored eye-candy, and other neat optical tricks should do platformer fans  proud.   Sound OK, so the soundtrack is a bit too perky for grumpy gamers' tastes.  But you have to admit the tunes really get your heart racing, which was the audio  production team's intention.  It's rough when even a product's musical score  is working in tandem with the environmental hazards to throw one's game off. Mercifully, the sound clips are cute and tame, especially the playful grunts used to depict character speech.  Audio-wise, you'll hear no  complaints from us.Talk about a surprise.  Frogger 2's not just a respectable update to a geriatric franchise, it's also one of the best platformers to grace the PlayStation so far this year. Let this be a lesson to budding developers that one needn't reinvent the wheel to produce a high caliber game.  When it comes down to mass market hits, like the saying says, history has a funny way of repeating itself.", "date": "Oct 18, 2000"}
