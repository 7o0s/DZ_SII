Since last August, the publisher has released three Uno games for the Game Boy Advance (Uno/Skip-Bo, Uno 52 and Uno Freefall) as well as this DS game (collecting Uno, Skip-Bo and Uno Freefall) and another one coming later this month (Uno 52). The GBA games played well, although we recommended that gamers pick up one release rather than all three. But now that the games have hit DS, they're pretty underwhelming.    For those unfamiliar with Uno, it involves distributing a deck made up of cards that each have a number and a color. A card is placed in the middle of the table, and players take turns covering the top card with one of their own, matching either the color or the number. The idea is to get rid of all one's cards before the other players. Anytime a card can't be placed, more must be drawn and there are loads of special cards that speed up the process or punish the other players. When players get down to just one card, they must shout ~Uno!~ or else take two additional cards for their silence.    This collection includes the classic form of Uno, as well as the popular Skip-Bo variation, which doesn't really have anything to do with Uno other than it also involves getting rid of cards. Skip-Bo could best be described as chess to solitaire's checkers. The game is played with cards numbered 1 to 12. All cards are distributed among the players, and 4 cards are set in the middle of the deck. Players use each turn to unload as many of their cards on these piles as possible; a card can be placed on top of a card with a value directly below it, so a 9 can be placed on top of an 8. Players can also build up their own 4 piles of cards, which can be pulled from at any time. The object is to be the first player with no cards left. Compared to the frantic and immediate nature of Uno, Skip-Bo is a more thoughtful, slowly-paced game. It doesn't force the bizarre wild cards on players that Uno features, allowing for more reliance on strategy than luck.    The third game featured is Uno Freefall, the obligatory Tetris clone. Much like the Pac-Attack puzzle game from the GBA Pac-Man Collection, Uno Freefall shoehorns the world of Uno into a falling block game and comes up with an equally-forgettable experience. The rules of Uno are relatively intact in these tiny falling blocks. Each block displays a card, and players must link up three or more blocks by their color or number. Additionally, face-down Uno cards are scattered everywhere. Linking up a chain of blocks flips any face-down cards the chain was touching.    The problem is that blocks only come down one at a time (instead of in sets, as in games like Puyo Pop and Columns) and there are only four colors, in spite of there being 8 horizontal columns. This makes the game ridiculously easy, since each color can just be dropped into its own designated column. Disappointing too is that while the wild cards from Uno are present, they all seem to do the same thing (remove flipped cards across the board), regardless of what's on their face. If the developers had figured out a way to incorporate the original functionality of these cards, and maybe even force the player to work off the last color/number that was used, the game could have been challenging and enjoyable. As it is, Uno Freefall is maybe five minutes of fun that just eats up cart space.    The GBA Uno games had charming, dynamic graphics...for a 240x160 pixel screen. Throw those same graphics onto two 256x192 screens and suddenly, everything feels empty. In fact, there's far less going on here than in the GBA games, since opponent cards are now hidden, instead of just flipped over. The DS collection deserved an art upgrade with larger cards and better environments. Space is used too economically here and the developers should have gone out of their way to justify spanning the game across two screens. Everything in the game is very pixelated and low-color, which worked fine on the low-tech GBA games, but here it just feels lazy. It's honestly more fun playing one of the GBA Uno games on one screen of the DS than spanning this half-assed effort across both.    Touchscreen input is available in all menus and during gameplay, although it doesn't offer anything that playing with the face buttons doesn't. Some odd choices were made in the touch control scheme, too, such as requiring players to tap the card they choose and then tap the deck, rather than just double-tapping the card itself. Little quirks like this may have players scratching their head instead of actually enjoying the game.    The worst offense is how ~Uno~ is called. The developers missed a golden opportunity by not allowing the DS microphone to be used to call the term out. It wouldn't have required actual voice recognition, just a monitoring for audio in those two seconds after players set down that penultimate card. Instead, players have to tap at a tiny, barely noticeable icon that appears on the bottom screen. There isn't even a voice sample to accompany the tapping, making the whole practice feel even more abstract.    Menus are difficult to navigate. The two colors used for selection are white and yellow, making it difficult to tell what's highlighted. There are also awful little quirks, such as account deletion; rather than allowing players to select which user account to delete, the game deletes the one the user is currently in, and without double-checking if that's what the user actually wanted to do. Accounts don't really mean much in this game anyway as they keep a running tally of games won and rounds played, but don't build up any currency toward unlocking additional modes or goodies. There is a pre-set 'Guest' account and it's just as much fun playing under that as a user-created one.       Because this collection is on DS, local wireless multiplayer is supported. However the multiplayer modes do not support single-cart game-sharing, meaning each player must own a copy of the Uno collection in order to participate. Considering the amount of data Nintendo's first-party DS games have been able to stream to an empty DS, it's inexcusable that a game as simple as Uno couldn't do the same. Uno is the perfect casual multiplayer game, and forcing kids to plunk down $40-$80 for a multiplayer match is ridiculous. DSI's Uno games worked pretty well on GBA, in spite of the fact that they should have all been on one cart. On DS however, the games feel pretty empty. Visuals and music are identical to the GBA games, failing to take advantage of what the DS can offer, and menus are oddly confusing this time. Lack of single-cart multiplayer really hurts, as does the inability to shout ~Uno!~ If you're an Uno nut, pick up one of the GBA games instead. Everyone else, save your DS slot for something more worthwhile, like Clubhouse Games or World Championship Poker.", "date": "Jan 11, 2007"}
