The person who had the courage to green light a kids' show entirely based around a talking kitchen cleaning utensil with pants deserves some kind of medal. And therapy.   Nonetheless, if you're reading this, you already know what a global superstar SpongeBob SquarePants has become. And like all global superstars (especially the cartoon kind), many sloppy, second-rate video games about them are quickly made to cash-in on the popularity. Unfortunately, SpongeBob's Atlantis SquarePantis is one of those sloppy, second-rate video games. This is somewhat of a shame because there have been some legitimately decent SpongeBob games in the past (Battle for Bikini Bottom comes to mind). But don't try to fool yourself: Atlantis SquarePantis is boring.  Really boring.   Some pictures need no captions. Surprisingly, the game actually does start off promising because they drop you right into an ice-cream firing tank from the get-go. Honestly, how can you screw up an ice-cream firing tank? Well, bland graphics, bland level design, and bland goals such as ~shoot the targets to shoot more tanks~ come to mind. There is a certain novelty that comes with being the evil Plankton and shooting the heck out of Atlantis, but this passes pretty fast when the level drags on and on. This will actually be a theme with the game: although the game is only a few hours long, each level drags on for an eternity.   You see, each level is actually a different kind of mini-game, even if the developers don't use the term ~mini-game.~ Out of the fourteen levels in the game, there are driving levels (like the aforementioned tank one), puzzle-solving maze areas where you switch between two characters to avoid traps, on-rail shooter sections, and weird sections when you just hit the corresponding controller buttons when they flash on the screen. Each of these level types might actually be fun if they were shortened and thrown in a rapid-fire game like WarioWare. But no: the developers instead saw fit to take these mini-games and stretch them to cruel proportions. The end result is that you're completely sick of that gameplay element by the end of the level. They probably thought that if you make a mini-game drag on and on, then it magically drops the ~mini~ status and becomes a full, normal game. Nice try, guys -- videogames don't work like that.   That squirrel has issues. I would be more OK with this setup if the individual levels were at least fun. They're not. What's even more maddening is that each different game type has the potential to be fun. For example, the maze areas are a little clever: each character has a special ability to get past certain obstacles (SpongeBob can flip gates up, Patrick can throw other characters across gaps, etc.) so the player is constantly switching between two characters to get through the maze. This sounds good on paper, but actually playing it is tedious. The fixed camera means that you'll fall off platforms for no reason and there's nothing interesting to look at. The whole thing feels more like work than a game. And since each level is broken up into four or five increasingly complex sections, you'll be doing the same thing over and over before you actually finish that level.   Admittedly, the on-rails sections are actually decent. One set of them takes the Pokemon Snap approach and has you taking pictures of things in a museum as security guards try to stop you (Fear not -- you can throw Patties at them). Another level has the slightly offensive Texan squirrel, Sandy, flying off the handle and shooting up an entire Atlantian palace with ping pong balls (this section is actually a little creepy, because you see her angry, insanity-filled face reflected on the screen as she's shooting ping pong ballsout of Squidwarddon't ask). But once again, these sequences drag.    You're going to be doing this a lot. Get used to it. However, the worst offender of cheap game design are the ~Button Combo~ levels. These areas flat out suck. Initially, it seems that these will be music-based levels because the first time they pop up has something to do with music. But no, music levels would be fun and you can't have that in this game. Instead, a sequence plays out where characters walk in a straight line and you press button combinations that flash across the screen to keep the characters walking. No thought went into these sequences whatsoever: the button presses aren't timed with anything, the random use of L1 and R1 are sure to annoy some kids (especially those who don't know their right from their left), and you'll grow tired of the same repeating backgrounds as you jam out Up, Left, Left, Right, Down, L1, L1, R1, R1, Left, Left, so on and so forth.   So is there any reason to actually play this game? Sadly, there is -- the writing and voice acting are actually pretty funny (by SpongeBob standards anyway). There are a good variety of lines (although Mr. Krabs isn't voiced at all ... guess his voice actor was on vacation) and the short cutscenes between levels makes it seem like you're watching the show. But then you realize that you have to keep playing to see more cutscenes and the illusion is lost (it's probably more worthwhile to just buy a Spongebob DVD and watch that). You can also obtain tokens depending on how well you do during a level and use them to unlock little Arcade games (simple Flash-like games that two people can play), alternate versions of the levels, game art, and (probably the best feature) level commentary provided by SpongeBob. With this on, SpongeBob makes it seem like the game was shot like a movie and provides little anecdotes about the ~filming.~ If this consisted of more than just small snippets of dialog, it would actually be a good incentive to play those boring, tedious levels again.It is clear that this game was just hastily put together to coincide with the new SpongeBob episodes that just started airing. Its really not worth a parents money or a childs time. Diehard SpongeBobites will play it regardless, but just do yourself a favor and rewatch episodes of the show on DVD.", "date": "Nov 9, 2007"}
