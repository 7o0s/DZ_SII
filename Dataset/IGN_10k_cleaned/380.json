They bought the Atari coin-op division from Time Warner. This gave the Midway/Williams group access to a large number of classic coin-op titles and their home gaming rights. Meanwhile Hasbro went out and purchased the Atari Computer rights, which gives them certain rights to product from before 1984. In fact one of the funnier things is to listen to both Midway/Atari and Hasbro/Atari and have them describe the rights they think they hold. Fortunately the rights issues concerning Paper Boy are quite clear and after the strong sales of previous retro titles it came as no surprise when Midway announced their intention to bring Paper Boy to the N64.  Gameplay Let's state one thing up front. This is a great game. And yet when I first picked up the title I was very disappointed. Let me explain. I consider the original Paper Boy to be one of the greatest coin-op titles of all time along side Joust, Defender, Q-Bert etc. The original Paper Boy had 3 different streets (easy, medium and hard levels) that you traversed each day of the week delivering newspapers. As you went down the road you got a delivery credit if the paper landed on the porch of the house or in the newspaper holder outside. The houses were always on your left and coin-op control was by means of a handle bar that you pushed forward to accelerate and pulled back on to brake. Broken windows on a subscriber's house cost you the delivery while points were scored for hitting various objects, especially non subscriber's houses. If you got through the street successfully, there was an obstacle course with various targets that generated different point totals, and if you were really clever you found the secret entrance to the second obstacle course after the first.  Now of course you wouldn't expect the new Paper Boy to be an exact carbon copy but developer High Voltage has gone off on an interesting, and ultimately successful, tangent. In addition in a surprise choice the developer went with a retro 3D look and initially it is so strange it impacts game play. I found about a 30 minute learning curve to get comfortable with the graphics as they related to game play. My son, on the other hand, didn't even blink and just jumped right in. To each their own.  The game starts with only a couple of levels or routes available, Alphaville and Alice's RV Haven. You must deliver a certain number of papers and once completed successfully the number of subscribers on your route will increase. So for example, in Alphaville you start of with 6 subscribers but must build the route up to 16 in total. Curiously the subscribers never decrease and you can smash all the windows on a property but if you get the mail on the porch then it is considered delivered. More radically, the houses are now on both sides of the street and while that may reflect reality it introduces a new game play mechanic of having to aim to each side of the street rather than the traditional method of just firing. Building up the route is important because you need new subscribers to open up the next route. This means that while you may have done well and delivered 10 papers on the second level it is worth going back to build it up to the maximum 16, because all those extra papers will help open up subsequent levels.  This is totally different from the original Paper Boy and very off putting when you go into a product with certain expectations based on a name. That said, it is also brilliantly conceived and flawlessly executed. What makes it so special is that the designers resisted the temptation to make each level immediately harder. Once a level has been opened, initially you only need to deliver 6 papers to start. What this does is it brings you down from the high of opening up a new stage and allows you to explore the new level reasonably leisurely before start to ramp up the difficulty again by adding more subscribers. This is great game design and when you combine it with level tuning that puts the next subscriber total required just out of reach, it ends up with one of the games of the year.  Each level also has a bonus round that has three levels of completion, bronze, silver and gold. Finding three coins in each level accesses these bonus levels. To do this you must knock over various people and objects to grab the coins. Bonus subscribers also come with the completion, so it is worth the time to search the areas to find the coins. As there is no penalty for breaking things you are free to fire away at everything from in-line skaters to a wandering Moose in hopes of finding the coins. The bonus levels feature different game play styles, such as an obstacle course similar to the one in the original and catching fireflies by running into them.  Lastly the difficulty setting is based on time. While generous on the easy and medium settings, the 25 seconds provided on the hard setting seems crazy until you learn the other new component in the game  Stunts! Again I thought throwing in stunts to Paper Boy was kind of weird. There is a training mode to get you used to the idea but it all seemed somewhat foreign until I tried to use it in game play. Pressing the down c button on the controller will make the paper boy or paper girl jump into the air. The longer you hold the button the more power there is in the jump. Pushing other buttons in combination will make the character spin and loop in the air. Landing them successfully generates not only bonus points but much more importantly bonus time. Combine this with hitting the paper in the newspaper holder, rather than the porch, which also adds bonus time and the hard level becomes playable. The stunts work because you can perform them as you move down the street without losing valuable time or direction.  About the only negative is a control issue. I'm not a fan of using the A or B button for acceleration. Why the control stick was not set for acceleration and brake, to mimic the handlebars of the original coin-op is beyond me. In addition the throwing papers to each side also takes some getting used to. The Pelican Beach level has some very tricky boat locations for subscribers and the usual forgiveness of the control on other levels, doesn't work as well here. However, while you sometimes have to double back for a missed paper, there is never a sense that you lost the game because of a control issue.  As I sat down to read through the manual  yes I read through the manual  I flipped through some of the levels, Alphaville, Alice's RV Haven and Moose Pellet Park. The latter got a chuckle out of me but it seemed misplaced with not much humor elsewhere, at least not initially. However as you play the game, there is a pretty funny gag that runs throughout the game. After each level, there is a newspaper headline that sometimes sets up the next level but more often than not is just a chance for a laugh. Panther fights Black Bear in Coal Mine, with accompanying ~picture~ was one and another concerned girls liking guys who play video games!  There's even the classic Dewey beats Truman  ask your parents, or grandparents about that one  which shows someone invested time on polishing this chrome. It's a small thing but you end up looking forward to getting to the newspaper to see what silly headline is next. That's a nice game mechanic.  The easy mode is indeed pretty easy for most game players. There are only six total levels followed by a boss level. Obviously there weren't any bosses in the original, but here in Dr. Tesla's Castle you have to figure out how to defeat the monster who can't be hurt by newspapers.  The medium and hard levels build on these base levels, (but you do have to play them again) and then add in new themed routes such as a Construction Zone or a Zoo. It's the small things that I like. For example the Ghost Town is set out in the shape of a skull and crossbones.    Graphics As I mentioned earlier the look of the game is retro 3D and it makes you feel thoroughly old when you realize that you can get to the stage where it is possible to have a retro 3D era! And it isn't just retro 3D, I mean it's retro retro 3D. Cars with square wheels and odd looking shapes, houses that you'd swear would fall over at a gust of wind. It is a strange choice and I can only work on the assumption that the developer felt that a nostalgic feel was required for the game. Now that we are used to much more visually pleasing 3D graphics it gives a sense of awkwardness that frankly I don't think the game needed. Does it detract from the game, well yes a bit, at least initially. But as I finished up a session late last night, I'd forgotten all about the graphics and was trying to get the final subscriber in Tesla Town to open up another level at the far end of the game. The graphics had become a non issue.  Sound Sound and Music in video games is a sore subject for me most of the time. Most companies do an adequate job of putting in the perfunctory ~oofs~ and ~aahs~ accompanied by crashes,booms and bangs as appropriate. Midway is no exception. The music is pleasant enough and oddly reminiscent of an old crazy golf game on the Apple IIgs  again nostalgia generated I assume. Various audio cues come into play, especially to let you know when there is a wild animal around. Nothing quite like getting blind sided by a Moose.  Midway is going to have a devil of a time positioning this in the marketplace. They've slapped the name Paper Boy on the title and yet at best it is a genetic mutation, and a distant one at that, of the original Paper Boy. Anyone who picks this up with the preconceived notion that they are going to play just an updated version of the classic Paper Boy is going to be disappointed.The game play is quite easy on the first route but ramps on the second. This will make it tough for youngsters. So you end up with a game that is a little too difficult for the young players yet might be initially disappointing to adults who will come to the game with certain expectations based on the title. This is the danger of using an old franchise name. Damned if you do and Damned if you don't.And yet, this is a great game. The play balance is perfect, not just great, but perfect. There is a fine line between repetitive game play that bites and repetitive game play for a purpose that continues to be enjoyable because you keep getting further along. Paper Boy is squarely on the correct side of that line.Don't buy this because you liked the old Paper Boy, buy it because you want to play one of the sleepers of the year.", "date": "Nov 6, 1999"}
