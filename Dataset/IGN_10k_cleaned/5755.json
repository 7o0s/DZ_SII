Blood 2 is technically proficient, extremely violent, and as about as creative as Top Ramen.  Shooters are supposed to be all about mindless violence, though. The basic premise is to throw despicable, slavering monsters at you in seemingly endless hordes, and then give you just enough firepower to put them down, twitching, onto the stone cold pixels of some dungeon. So if Blood 2 is just like Wolfenstein, Doom, Duke Nukem, Hexen, or any other of several dozen games we've seen over the last five years, who cares?  Well I do. I blasted my way through Wolfenstein 3D already. I shot my way through Doom a long time ago. I did Duke and Quake, I am goddamned sick and tired of looking for the stupid key. It is time for this genre to grow up.  And obviously I'm not alone, or how else would you explain the burgeoning presence of the story-driven hybrids, things that promise new vistas of design, things like Deus Ex, Thief the Dark Project, System Shock 2?  Blood 2 is none of these things. It is an unimaginative revisit to Doom country, a blood-soaked update cloaked in a 3D engine. It may look better because it rides Moore's law, but it's the same worn-out design rewritten and repackaged for faster chips. It does nothing Doom and the rest haven't done better and before.  So instead of a space marine your alter ego is a goon named Caleb. He's an undead antichrist that eviscerates, mutilates, and devastates with sadistic glee, but his most frightening characteristic is a tendency to spout off some of the most horrid one-liners this side of the slush pile. The plot, such as it is, involves chasing some undead guy named Gideon throughout almost the entire game. Apparently he's in charge of some cult you used to belong to and you're angry at him. Good enough.  The setting for this epic manhunt is--surprise, surprise--a futuristic city. Now isn't Blood 2 supposed to be about fighting the Undead? This is Army of Darkness material here. This is The Night of the Living Dead. You want to hear the chainsaws, the werewolf's howl. You want to be hunting vampires, hammering wooden stake through their Gothic hearts. You want to see graveyards quivering unnaturally, see hands claw through century-old soil, or Great Cthulhu rising from the sea--and instead you get another bunch of heavily armed guys running loose in yet another futuristic city.   If there's anything new in Blood 2, it's that the game turns the violence notch up to eleven, in true Spinal Tap fashion. It promises and delivers buckets full of pixelated blood.  Corpses can be slashed to ribbons. Bodies drop to the ground, scorched like burnt out fireworks. Innocent bystanders can--and in many cases, must--be hacked to bits, so you can get to the power-ups cleverly hidden inside. This is Mario-meets-Manson, bad Karma in a box. But I'll let you make up your own mind about gratuitous game violence and the mentality behind it. What matters is this, is Blood 2 worth 50$?  I say no. If all you want to do is to smack pixels around with buckshot, have at it. But if you're looking for something fresh, something that Doom didn't do years ago, something new under the sun, move on.   At least the game is technically proficient. The LithTech engine is a serviceable 3D software machine. It's not as rich or immersive as the Unreal engine, but it's leaner and quicker. It's not Quake II either, though it's hard to pinpoint exactly why, though there are little, visual, environmental touches that feel a bit off. The rooms look too square. Sure, everything else (prior to those Quake III shots) looks square too, but the angularity is not as well hid here as in other games. Some of the lighting looks wrong too--the shafts of luminance spilling down from the skylights look like tangible objects, a little too solid.  But in general it's slick, and while some bugs are present, including random lockups, the game is by no means a roach motel. Sure, every time you save, it automatically activates your inventory when you return to the game. Items can be hard to pick up since they're so small. Climbing ladders is peculiarly difficult, and clipping problems crop up periodically. Yet while these traits are annoying, they don't actually destroy gameplay, just make you save more often. There's not much wrong with LithTech in and of itself, and all the bonus goodies Monolith has planned for budding mod authors and level makers is genuinely classy.  But as Id Software likes to demonstrate, an engine does not a game make. For a shooter, the game has to succeed in its levels, but too many of Blood 2's levels are flawed. And by flawed I mean blinking unplayable. I mean sheer tedium. I mean hour after mind-numbing hour of wandering back and forth through deserted, lookalike halls, looking for the %$#@ keycard that will let you move on to the next area.   There are a couple of ~Woah, cool, look at this!~ levels in Blood 2, like the cathedral or the floating airship. But the rest are your usual room-corridor affairs, replete with those tired old fallbacks, the jumping puzzle and the key hunt.  Now jumping puzzles were all fine and good back when 2D side scrollers were all there was, but what are they doing here?  ~Here, for variety, are some annoying jumping puzzles! If you miss, you die! If you die, you have to reload! If you have to reload, it takes a good twenty seconds because of all the textures!~ These puzzles are not as common or as laughable as they are in say Trespasser, but they rear their ugly heads once too often.  Far, far worse is the over-reliance on making you go look for some key that opens some door, as if this were some exciting and engrossing form of gaming. I want to be clear about this: looking for crap is not fun. I have to look for enough crap in real life--a parking place, misplaced keys. Shooting crap is fun. More shooting, less looking.  Heck, I probably spent half of the game wandering back and forth through deserted, shot-up corridors, searching for a key, a switch, or whatever, to let me into the next part of the level. Yet all the while I'm toting around ten heavy weapons, not to mention an assortment of plastic explosives, time bombs, or whatnot. So if I can shoot up desks, vending machines, windows, potted plants, statues, not to mention gigantic, slavering, extra-dimensional monsters, why can't I blow through a simple, stupid wooden door?  I just find this kind of stuff lazy and unimaginative. It's the equivalent of making the adventure gamer play a game of 'Concentration' in order to solve some so-called epic quest, or making the strategy gamer defeat his opponent not with a clever orchestration of feint and maneuver, but by cranking out mo' tanks mo' faster.  If anything could have saved the levels, it would have been the creatures peopling them, the bad guys, the blokes in the black hats. What would Jurassic Park be without its dinosaurs? Batman without his Joker? Siskel without his Ebert? Good villains have saved many a bad production.  Well, Blood 2's bestiary consists of a mix of gun-toting lackeys and the previously mentioned slavering, extra-dimensional monsters. The gun-toters don't do much but tote guns, but there are quite a few monsters who can turn invisible and teleport around, ala Hexen II. And then there's the dreaded face-huggers and your standard gigantic, wannabe Lovecraftean bosses. All in all, they're a motley bunch, with decent looks, blistering attacks, and taunts that start off chilling but wear thin after the umpteenth utterance.  They do have one thing in common: they're all as dumb as toast. You can literally peak around a corner and snipe at them until they're dead without them ever reacting. Gee, is someone shooting at me? Should I run away? Nah, I better just stand here and bleed. Gideon said so.  Yes, the creatures in most games are pretty stupid. Artificial intelligence is still an oxymoron. But the Blood 2 monsters deserve an award for being the biggest sitting ducks this side of Waterfowl Hunter.  But do stupid monsters make the game too easy? Well, no. To make up for their lack of mobility, the designers have thoughtfully beefed up the bad guys' hit points, and then packed them into the levels as if they were riding commuter trains, which, in fact, is exactly what many of the levels are.  I'm not saying Blood 2 is a horrible game, some quick cash-in created by cynical, game-hating bean-counters. It's not. It's just too predictable, despite doing some things well. Here's something it does well--the weapons are numerous and varied. The two-handed sawed-off shotgun mode is easily the best weapon combo to date. In fact, there are so many weapons, that you actually have to drop some in order to pick up new ones, since a keyboard only has ten number keys.  The soundtrack too, when it gets a chance, is creepy in a Gregorian madhouse kind of way. When used properly, music can do more to set a scene and create a tone than any other element in a game. Think of Doom's haunting MIDI tunes, now so closely associated in so many of our minds with the sheer tension of creeping through an abandoned lunar base shotgun in hand, then suddenly being forced into swapping rocket volleys with, well, slavering, extra-dimensional monsters. And now that PCs sport CD audio, we ought to be awash in immersive scores. But sadly, as happens all too often with games, Blood 2 fails to leverage its music, drowning it out with repetitive environmental cues.  As for multiplayer, it's fine on a LAN, but how many of you out there have a LAN? Like Blood 2's cousin Shogo, modem/Internet play will probably have to be patched.  Bottom line--this is an utterly ordinary shooter, hidebound by convention and hamstrung by formulaic gameplay. For people who may have only played one or two of these clones before, there's fun to be found. But for the rest of us, it's a pass, even though a lot of time and effort went into making a decent engine and some dark and creepy graphics.  Monolith missed out on way too many opportunities to play with the horror genre and instead chose to lock itself up within the rusty old shackles of the Doom game design.  --Jason Bates", "date": "Nov 20, 1998"}
