Sony doesn't want that to happen to the PlayStation Eye. You know what I'm talking about -- the EyeToy was a great idea, but nothing other than a few Kinetic games and some SingStar functionality were ever really added to the peripheral's arsenal. Now, the PlayStation Eye is out, Eye of Judgment is garnering a following, and it seems there are new Eye-compatible games on the store each week.   The Trials of Topoq is one of those games.   If you believe the intro movie and text, you're in a hardened test to discover the one, true champion who can guide the sacred orbs to safety, but in reality, Topoq is a challenging puzzler that makes use of the PS3's all seeing eye with pretty good results.   At its most basic level, Topoq is all about guiding these orbs over expansive squares of tiles. Whatever the PlayStation Eye is pointed at -- and it should be you if you're playing this game correctly -- becomes the image that is the background of the tiles.    Still with me?     Anyway, you move your hands toward the camera and the corresponding, on-screen tiles rise. Move your extended hand in an on-screen direction, and those tiles rise as the previous tiles fall. Imagine a bed sheet pulled taut and your hand pressing into it from underneath and moving in a given direction. That's your relation to the tiles. You're underneath them and your movements create peaks and slopes. There will be a handful of these squares on screen at any given time -- and your image will be on all of them -- but you need only worry about your movements on the one containing the orb and any obstacles that are spread out before you.   Whew. So, you make these movements in Topoq with the determination to move the orb that is sitting on the tiles to the goal at the end of the city. The missions start off simple as you raise the area around the balls to cause them to roll, but eventually things start getting crazy -- gargoyles pop up and move around, big metal crates drop, teeter-totter surfaces are thrown into the mix, and you've got to worry about rolling off railing-less surfaces.   The puzzle part of all this is figuring out how to get your orb to the light at the end of the tunnel while accomplishing goals such as breaking open a certain number of crates or completing the course in a certain amount of time, and even if you don't believe me, the game can be a lot of fun.   Yay! In one of the first tasks -- there are 30 challenges spread between five different cities that are these towering structures surrounded by clouds -- I watched my ball drop a level and then begin rolling towards the open edge and certain death. I tossed my left arm in the air, bent it in a C-shape and slowly began moving it towards the center of my square to save the orb. In that instant, I lost myself in the experience. I didn't think about how dumb I must look doing this and I didn't think about other games I could be playing -- I thought about saving that fricking orb.   Is the game perfect? No. As much as I was entertained, I also found myself frustrated. There'd be times I'd sit forward in my chair and my face would move the ball, I'd carefully try to move my arms to the other side of the screen and the ball would start moving, and other times, I'd try to make a mountain in a specific place as the camera wouldn't read my move at all. However -- with the exception of being able to properly detect what I was trying to do -- those are more gripes about how the puzzler puzzles.    Maybe I shouldn't be a dumbass and sit forward in a game that's controlled by movements, eh?My socks weren't blown off by The Trials of Topoq, but they didn't need to be. Even with its flaws and ho-hum feeling, this is a solid short-attention puzzler, a good looking game and a good implementation of the PlayStation Eye. The game feels kind of flat. Although there are different cities, they all feel and look alike, there's no multiplayer of any kind, and the music is a bit repetitive, but fans of the quirky-game genre should have no qualms about buying and trying this for $4.99.", "date": "Dec 22, 2007"}
