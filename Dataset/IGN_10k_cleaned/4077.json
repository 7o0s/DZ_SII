{"name": "Vangers", "name_review": "Vangers", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/08/19/vangers", "text": "On the surface Vangers has got to be one of the oddest game ideas ever. I mean, the plot itself -- humans  who've evolved into insect creatures (or something like that, even I haven't  quite nailed down the details) and drive around in all-terrain vehicles --  doesn't seem quite the standard fare, does it?    Forget the plot, the surrounding story, all of it. The game revolves around you simply taking product from one location to the next, and trying to fend off other cars doing the same thing. On each delivery, you earn money to upgrade your vehicles and weaponry that will make you the top Vanger in the universe. The game could have been called something a bit more simplistic -- like Delivery Boy -- but no, the designers had to go way overboard with the game's storyline and universe.  Not that it's a bad thing, mind you, just that the bizarre up-front story might scare away gamers and cause them to miss out on the solid gameplay that rests underneath.  Most of the game takes place in an overhead perspective from which you pilot your vehicle. The war-torn and crater-filled terrain isn't exactly friendly, even for an all-terrain craft such as the one that's given to you at the beginning of the game. Obviously, the more money you earn the better vehicle you can purchase, but in the meantime you'll have to put up with some nasty navigating around an aggressive world. The physics are pretty accurate, if a bit exaggerated -- your car will rock, bump and jump into the air, courtesy of the polygonal model used for each of the vehicles. Combat between you and the computer opponents can become quite intense as you try and target each other while slamming around the unforgiving landscape.  But it's hard to shake the impression that the developers wanted to mask an otherwise mediocre game with an overwhelming universe and story. Sure, it's fun to figure out what you need to do (and believe me, there's a rather steep learning curve), but once you understand it, it's all just a matter of driving from point A to B, picking up and dropping off cargo, and reading more of the tale of the Vangers.  There's an impression of deeper gameplay as you dig further and discover new locations, but other than the unfolding plot, there's not much else to uncover in terms of fun.   Bottom line? Vangers is a product for those looking for something weird and unexpected, but the driving and shooting aspect isn't enough payoff to wade through the complexity of the game's storyline. -- Craig Harris", "date": "Aug 19, 1998"}
