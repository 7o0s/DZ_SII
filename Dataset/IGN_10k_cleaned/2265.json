Andretti Racing is a great combination of extended simulation, what EA Sports is known for, and Ridge Racer-style arcade driving. This title succeeds at both.  With two types of vehicles, Indy and stock, and 16 tracks, plus a full season mode, Andretti Racing displays much more depth than most arcade racers. Each circuit requires an entirely different driving style, as each handles remarkably differently. Handling is also adjustable, from tire type to acceleration and everything in between. Finding the right configuration is essential.  Presentation is second to gameplay in Andretti. The graphics aren't the best the PlayStation has ever seen, but they're competent and get the job done. Draw-in is kept to a minimum, also. The tracks themselves are extremely challenging, with many of the turns requiring deft power slide skills.  Andretti isn't the best racing game ever made, but it won't disappoint fans of the genre.   Jaz Rignall", "date": "Nov 22, 1996"}
