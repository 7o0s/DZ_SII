Yup, we're stuck in Big Super Mecha Robot Land with Battle Assault 3 Featuring Mobile Suit Gundam SEED or BA3FMSGS for short. Ah screw it, let's just call it BA3. It's a game that tackles the idea of mechs with grumpy prepubescent pilots inside them with a fair amount of tenderness and barely any AI. This is a game that uses its own flaws to its advantage to create some levels of difficulty, but what the hell is that?   Indeed, what is here in BA3 is a seriously flawed concept that's wrapped up in the skin of an anime that will lure buyers in before it assaults them with some bad design. If you were to look at a screen shot you'd be forgiven for thinking that there is some good stuff here like robots beating the mother-loving crap out of each other. Good times, right? Well, no, no, and, no freakin' way (yes that was the answer to just one question). This singularity of an entity deserves multiple negatives to warn away the faithful.   The basic concept is that there are the good mechs that the player controls and a bunch of bad ones that the evil computer controls. Flying through the galaxy brings the good guys into repeated conflicts with the bad guys while the rest of the universe yawns and gets back to its laundry. They've seen it all before and since the robots have a range of just a hundred feet or so they're really not that scary.   When the robots come into a one on one battle the game can barely handle it. By that I mean that it is ridiculously easy to beat up any other robot by itself. Constantly repeated combos or even just tapping the punch button while looking at something more interesting, like a piece of toast, can take care of most of the enemies in the game. So what's done is to confound the issue by throwing two robots into the battle as often as possible. Even if the total number of mechs to be destroyed in each arena is more than that it will always be two and they get replaced as they get destroyed.    This would almost be acceptable, but the dynamics in the game for attacking two mechs at once is pretty pathetic. The player's mech can target one of the two enemies and swap targets with the L1 button. Sadly, many things can get in the way of changing targets. Firing a weapon or guarding or being otherwise occupied can stop the switching of targets. There's also no auto-target for the nearest enemy so when things get confusing with two enemies coming in close the situation is just too confusing to care. The best bet is jumping out and taking them on on your own terms.   The biggest difficulty in these battles is keeping the targeting on the correct mech and jumping out of the way if one of them tries to attack while you're beating up the other. That's the biggest, and only, challenge here and it's a cop-out to make a game difficult only because the one vs. two battles are clumsy to execute. Instead of fighting robots, players will be fighting the very game itself. In the end the only victory is removing the disc from the PS2.     This situation would almost be salvageable if the very battles themselves were interesting, but the level design just didn't happen here. It's not bad, it's just not there in any shape or form. The battles take place in closed off arenas that have some changes in height in the terrain and a few objects that can be thrown or other weapons that can be fired. It's so standard and beyond uninspired that it's easy to imagine that the developers were figuring that putting these sloppy places on the surface of an asteroid in space was good enough.    In these space age lumpy football fields the robots move around and do a clunky ballet. Since the player's mech is always facing at least one enemy this makes free-roaming around the level extraordinarily worthless. Since the player's mech can only pull back a set distance from the farthest enemy this means that it's a struggle to pick up some items that can be used to a strategic advantage because games are supposed to be able to do that.    With just one enemy this is not as big of a deal, but it's the one vs. two where Ye Olde Designer failed us again. With one enemy standing off in the distance and limiting the player's movement the other can come in for a fight. So even if a mini-nuke is just a few feet away, the player has to wait for the farthest enemy to come closer to get it.   To the game's credit there is a small variety of moves that can be pulled off as well as some combos and other nifty Gundam stuff, but we'd be damned if we could find them all since there is no tutorial or training level in which to learn what you're supposed to do. This didn't impede our progress in knocking out one generic mech after another, though, but if developers want people to know what to do they should do something like, oh, put help in the game for figuring it out.    What completes the game, and really brings it together, is the storyline which basically goes like this.   Blue-haired guy/gal: Why did you do that?  Black-haired gal/guy: Because hahahaha!  Blue-haired guy/gal: I will get you.  Black-haired gal/guy: No, you won't!   Battle ensues.   Black-haired gal/guy: Ahhh! You got me!  Blue-haired guy/gal: Yup.   You can just see the magic contained in that little slice of life. It's stunning, really, and for those who like their tales of heroism enacted for them by 10 year-olds this is your bag, baby. There is one core of a game that is kind of interesting that's been buried so deep in BA3 that it's own existence will be discussed for years in board time (note: this is about a day in real time). That's the basic one on one fight with a somewhat decent exchange of punches and sword attacks. As for the rest of it this is a title that's best forgotten. It's an insult to anyone's intelligence and especially to fans of the series who at least deserve a game that doesn't assault them with its own faults.", "date": "Dec 6, 2004"}
