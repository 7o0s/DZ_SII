And more than most, NHRA Championship Drag Racing practically invites scathing laziness.   ~You go straight. Hahaha! This game is a 1.0 since 1 is basically a straight number. I'm clever and fulfilled my job requirements.~  Well, not really. To be good, not all games need street cred, guns, or a layer of amazing authenticity that features bumping into 400 other licensed cars with exactly no penalty. There's still a market for the hardcore gamer and the hardcore gamer likes all kinds of different things.  Bottom-line: casually disregarding NHRA Championship Drag Racing as just another straight-line racer with few redeeming qualities simply because it focuses on a rather narrowly appealing sport does no good or justice. When looking at NHRA objectively, or as a possible purchase, don't focus on the many ways it doesn't compete with Burnout. Instead, try and determine how well it represents the sport and how it may or may not improve upon a genre plagued by inexcusable throwaways. Do that and figure out whether it's worth it or not. At least, that's what I told myself prior to writing this.  Despite being cheap and being drag, NHRA is not bad. It's a bargain title, for sure, and so suffers from a predictably budged presentation and a few sloppy excludes, but it provides an excellent value for fans of the sport or gamers looking to experience something completely different. And yes, you do drive straight for five seconds. But understand that the problem solving associated with each race is almost as exciting as the race itself, which involves much more than forward.   For the unaware, drag racing can be broken down into five areas: tuning, burnout, staging, racing and analysis.  In terms of tuning, NHRA offers a wealth of options. Players can fiddle with lane choice, front and rear wing angles, front ballast, tire pressure, fuel (at initial flow, flow 1, flow 2 and final flow rates), spark, compression ratio, overdrive sliders, clutch 1, clutch 2, final clutch and even primary weight and secondary weight settings. Each of these configurable settings can positively or negatively alter your machine's performance level in a variety of specific areas. Each also comes with a basic descriptor and a more advanced explanation depending on the competence of the provided AI crew chief. Performer crew leaders are especially astute, while generic AI chiefs are more specialized and less helpful.  Top Fuel  Once you tune a car -- either automatically (which varies depending on crew chief) or to exacting specifications based on variable track information like surface and air temperature -- you'll get on the track and begin a round. This is where the burnout, staging and racing components all come in.   Each major aspect of the actual race is also well represented in NHRA. Note that if you have or can acquire a high quality USB racing wheel, we highly recommend one. Such a peripheral adds a considerable amount of challenge, depth and personality to the experience. With or without a wheel, racing begins with a burnout.   You'll find Top Fuel and Funny Car burnouts to be relatively simple, though not without their own quirks. Keep a good rev, keep a good line, warm the tires sufficiently, lay enough rubber down given what the surface temperature is, don't waste fuel... Once you get a burnout you're satisfied with (and there is no mid-race mulligan), begin inching your car into position. That process is staging.  In NHRA (and real drag racing) staging determines what kind of launch you're liable to have and how much grip you can get off the line depending on how well you match your burnout's groove. If you stage too deep (too close to the line), you may red light and disqualify yourself. Staging too shallow or off a mark may result in lost time or the necessity to steer-correct on a run, which could be disastrous. Once you stage, the lights flash and the race begins.  In addition to requiring lightning reflexes to get good launches, racing also requires instant responses during runs to correct but not overcorrect natural occurrences. Keep the line straight. Pump the gas if your tires smoke. Don't overextend your engine's capabilities on a hot day. Chute at the right time. Run it down before you over-rev and incur damage penalties... All this and more.   There is a lot of actual control applied to just racing in a straight line and all of it influences the outcome of a round and the future of your character in the season mode. But more important than how well you manage your controller is how well you manage your machine, which may simply fail regardless of how you race. When this happens, you need to go back and analyze the run, analyze the tuning, and then adjust accordingly. It's a combination of, ~Ah, crap. I screwed up here,~ and ~Oh, that damn thing blew up there because of this.~ Finding the balance is the only way to win. And when you do eventually destroy Ashley Force in a first round elimination by almost two and a half seconds after nearly botching four qualifying runs, you'll feel pretty good about it.  All the minute adjustments and tuning make up solid gameplay for Top Fuel and Funny Cars; of course, the Pro Stock races also involve shifting, which adds a whole new layer of potential catastrophe to your runs. But all that is okay. Really! The failures and resulting problem solving and experimentation are what make NHRA interesting: You're trying to make a machine run under variable conditions while considering driver error. You're also doing this against a nicely developed AI that's making its own mistakes and trying the same things.  As cool as that may be, NHRA is still a budget title and so the interactive tutorials aren't in, the aftermath pointers are lacking, the configuration predictions aren't around, and a lot of what could make the problem solving / racing combination really excellent just hasn't been implemented. So the base game sort of flails around in a good place, but not a great one.  As an example, multiplayer offers some pretty fun head-to-head action, but had a quick clock been placed on tuning (which should have been a requirement) and some more mini-games been slapped into the whole process, configuring, racing and then re-configuring for a better round under a time stamp could have been way more exciting than it is. Because none of that's there, we just sort of have to force ourselves through a bit of tedium and make up coffee table rules of our own.   And back in singleplayer, you might eventually wonder why the season mode is a little dry (why it's basically a series of events interspersed by a random challenge). Then you'll wonder why deeper cross-driver analyzation isn't possible (why you can't really figure out how someone went from a 6.292 in round one to a 4.554 in round two while you're tapping out at 5.5 with no traction). There are just a lot of little details that fell off the priority list somewhere along the way. At least NHRA does feature a solid collection of basics, a host of real drivers and venues, and a good amount of extra bonus content including a dozen videos, driver profiles and the like. As a genre, drag racing has a way to go before it can dethrone reigning NASCAR and Formula One titles (in terms of completeness and depth), but NHRA offers a good amount of complexity. Even if the game does fail to incorporate a wealth of extra features and the presentation required to make the in-depth tuning a more enjoyable sort of problem solving, the base gameplay offers plenty for content starved drag racing fans. And this regardless of however budget it may feel and however narrowly appealing it may be.Besides, where else can you race in 125 degree air temperature and on a 180 degree surface with 100% humidity in the dead of night?", "date": "Aug 30, 2005"}
