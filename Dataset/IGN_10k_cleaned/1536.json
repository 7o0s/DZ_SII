Maybe not right away -- they may even enjoy the colorful graphics of the box art, and gleefully smile when they see their favorite Nick toons come to life. But eventually, they will cry. They will cry from frustration. They will cry from aggravation. They will cry when they can't get to see the end of the game because of the absurdly and unfairly difficult gameplay. They will cry from the pain that hours playing stiff controls will inflict on their fingers. And finally, they will cry when their Game Boy is broken after they hurl it across the room as hard as they can.  I know I did...    Features:  Play as one of five different Rugrats, and play as baby Dil in extra stages Carnival-style mini-games Only for Game Boy Color   It is unbelievable that, now four games into the Rugrats license (plus a spin-off by another company), THQ and Software Creations are still doling this kind of punishment out on children. Supposedly this series has won awards. Unbelievable! What are they praising?  Here's just how it begins for kids trying desperately to enjoy this game. The levels sprawl endlessly across bland landscape for mile upon repeating mile of repetitive gameplay. Not so much a problem, since anybody under ten (and half of us well over ten as well) has that kind of mindless attention span to play through something even if it's not fun just to complete the task. But levels are put on a time limit of sometimes up to ten minutes. Due to the slow gameplay (that makes you wait for enemies to finish their route, since the jump is so limited it usually can't get over an enemy, and since you have no attack to get them out of your way), that given level takes over nine minutes to play through at the very best, and that's including knowing in advance how to avoid all traps. So where's the time for exploration? You crash through a level as fast as you can, checking every nook and cranny for switches, and suddenly, after playing for ten full minutes -- a long, long time for a level to go on in any game -- this thing tells you that you've failed and throws kids back to the start.  Yes, that sure seems frustrating, doesn't it. Ohh, but that's just the beginning. Then the game starts to really crank down on tiny children's tempers. Rugrats only allows players limited continues to finish the difficult tasks, so every time a young gamer fails, they lose another chance to succeed. And if they do finish a level... No, make that all of the levels in a given stage, meaning half an hour of gameplay given about three stages to play through at ten minutes apiece, the game presents you with a randomly-generated gibbilty-guk password. That's a pain in the popo for young players riding in a car or carting their portable system around. And, as an added swat to the fanny, the game doesn't even give kids a chance to go get a pen when they do unlock a password -- after 20 seconds, the game automatically jumps out of the password screen back to the game! Are you kidding me -- the first time that happened to me, I only had five of the digits written down. So unfair!  And it still gets better! Some of this -- the rough game clock, the ungainly password system, the nondescript levels -- any of it could be excused if the gameplay cooked. But if you've ever played a Game Boy Rugrats game before, you know that this game is a diaper full of cack. Control is unbelievably stiff. The babies jump and crawl around with the grace of a shufflepuck game. Leaping over enemies is almost a waste of time -- you might as well push through some of them since they slow you down so much with their gangly motions. It's really rough gameplay, brought up some by well-conceived levels. The light puzzle is near-brilliant, but because it takes so long to figure out and play through, the good design is wasted in a few continues. That's the crux of the gameplay in both mini-games and main levels-- some smart concepts, but it's way too frustrating and handily botched in execution to be fun for even competent gamers, much less young children.  Like re-spawning enemies? Well, then you'll love the aggravating chump play of Rugrats, where instant hits are rewarded with a repeat of a re-spawned enemy. As you explore, there are places where it's near impossible not to take a hit. But with the puzzle-based gameplay of Rugrats, the game forces you to double-back, and when you do... whammo, another instant hit from the re-spawned enemy.  Like long levels? Sure, we all do. But not when every inch of the stage looks exactly the same, making exploration an unbelievable chore. Visually, the game has its moments -- the ride aboard a moving rail in a ghost house, careening around corners, is quite impressive. But every main play stage is a choppy, strobed mess of stiff animation and shapeless graphics, just like it's been for four games now when this thing debuted on the Black & White Game Boy. The babies are well detailed in their jerky motions, with gigantic heads to show who the heck they are, but other creatures in levels range from dull (the R2-D2 rip-off bots) to shapeless blobs (especially the imaginary Cynthia zombies, which are just big blue sticks and do not in any way resemble the character they came from). And no matter how smooth the game looks or moves (in this case, not very), it's still incredibly maddening to have to trod through stage after grueling, tedious, long-winded stage of the same randomized visuals looking for a single needle in a haystack.     I tried... So hard I tried to be fair and open-minded to the newest Rugrats game, based on the upcoming film Rugrats in Paris. And I found the mini-games to be generally well conceived, if a little rough. Really, when I started it up and felt a tingle of fun creep in when playing the flying game, I though all had been forgiven.  No freakin' way. The abysmal gameplay that's been this game's calling card from day one is still there, only now with more involved challenges. I'd compliment Software Creations (an otherwise reputable company who probably fund all their other ventures on the shame money gotten from this series) and say it's more intelligent gameplay, but it's just more trial and error than cerebral. And even at that, the game is designed for little kids, so how incredible taxing gameplay is supposed to work for young players, I don't know. Heck, I can't even find reason to compliment the non-violent gameplay of this game -- the only reason it's non-violent is because the game design is too incompetent and simplistic to include an attack! Rugrats is mean. It makes little kids mad. It makes big kids furious. That's been the way for four games now, and Rugrats in Paris is another step in the wrong, wrong direction. Sure, it's not the toughest game ever made, but it's one of the least fun for the task. Try, for instance, the Track & Field-type mallet game where it's quite difficult to get the meter up, and then the game forces little fingers to leap across from the A and B buttons to the joypad. Or the level where you have to bounce on boogers, and it takes six or seven leaps just to get to a platform just inches out of the standard jumping range, all the while with the clock winding out. Or the silly tough tossing game where the ball yaws wide to the left with every throw. And that's one of the easy ones! It's an unkind game that will make kids feel like they've been bad, that they're too stupid to solve the challenges and too slow to complete the game. Don't be mean.", "date": "Nov 28, 2000"}
