Originally, Sega was going to leave this title in Japan, but when THQ stepped forward to assume the publishing role for many of Sega's products, the game can now show up on US shelves. And puzzle fans will not be disappointed. Though the Puyo Pop design isn't quite as classic as Tetris, it's darn close to it...and this Game Boy Advance version is so much better than the Tetris rendition offered to GBA owners last year. Features: 18 levels 15 characters Link cable support for four players (single and multicartridge) Battery save Only for Game Boy Advance  You might not have played this game with the same name, but the game has come to this country under many names -- most notably as Kirby's Avalanche on the Super NES and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine on the Genesis...not to mention as Puyo Pop for the three of you that bought it on the NeoGeo Pocket Color. Puyo Pop really isn't any different from those two versions of the game: you align two colored globs of glue as they fall into the pit, rotating them into four positions. When they fall into the bin, they'll link up with like colors. If four or more of the same color link together, they'll disappear and the rest of the globs will fall into the pit, possibly forming more links and chain reactions.  In Puyo Pop, you're fighting against different computer AI -- you each have your own pit to worry about, and you each get the exact same pattern of globs to rotate and place. If you form multiple chains that fall and disappear, you'll send piles of dead rocks over to your opponent...the bigger the chain reaction, the more rocks get dumped on your opponent. The only way you can get rid of these rocks is to create links on top of them, and when the link disappears, so do the surrounding rocks. If your bin fills to the brim, it's game over. The Game Boy Advance version of Puyo Pop doesn't change a thing to the established formula whatsoever...it follows the old credo of ~if it ain't broke, don't fix it,~ and on this handheld system, it's still as amazingly fun and deceptively addictive as it always has been. Sonic Team's GBA rendition offers the bare essentials in terms of graphics and sound, but that's perfectly fine since the gameplay is what makes Puyo Pop such an awesome creation. This edition of Puyo Pop features the same quirky single player mode where the lead character (you) meet other strange characters, one by one, who challenge your persona to a game of Puyo Pop. Each character has distinctly different gameplay AI, so it really does feel like playing against different opponents. But the storyline is just so darn stupid...don't let it turn you off to the gameplay between the cutscenes. What makes this version a must-have, apart from the great, established gameplay, is the attention to multiplayer. The developers utilize the Game Boy Advance's single cartridge link feature to invite every GBA owner to get in on the action...up to four players can link up and play, and what's more, the screen scales back so everyone can see what everyone's up to...and if someone's about to score a ridiculously high combo chain reaction. But the designers make sure that if you've bought a cartridge, more multiplayer modes will open up. It also encourages players to go through the single player Vs. modes, since the deeper you go solo, the more gaming options open up for two, three, or four player gaming. Last year, THQ released Tetris Worlds, probably the most disappointing handheld release of the Tetris series...ever. Sega comes to the rescue, giving THQ the rights to publish the US edition of Sonic Team's bean-matching puzzle game...and there was much rejoicing here, let me tell you. Puyo Pop is a fantastic puzzle game that's enhanced simply by letting a development team exploit the Game Boy Advance's link capabilities as far as it can go. Four player Puyo Pop is just so much fun and highly recommended.", "date": "Feb 21, 2002"}
