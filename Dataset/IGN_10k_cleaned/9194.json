Episode One wasn't as sweet, but still had some wonderful moments and helped develop Alyx Vance further as a character and tie her even more into the storyline. The newest, Episode Two, combines the excitement, variety, and spectacular level design of the original with the character and story development of Episode One creating an amazing package that anybody who played Half-Life 2 should gobble up as soon as possible whether that be alone or in the Orange Box.   The story finds Gordon Freeman, the silent but deadly scientist from Black Mesa, and Alyx Vance, the ever capable and crafty daughter of old friend Eli Vance, on the outskirts of City 17 and looking to make their way to resistance headquarters to deliver information vital to the cause.     While there's still a strong amount of environmental storytelling, you'll hear a lot more conversations from a lot of different sources explaining the events in more detail. This helps fill out the events happening around you and has the added benefit of helping give the secondary characters more depth. Alyx, Eli, Dr. Kleiner, and the return of the blowhard Magnusson fill out a terrific cast that continues to grow in size and depth of personality. The voice actors lend their gusto along with improved facial animation to insert a range of emotion that's basically unmatched in games.  Add in the character models and body animation that also improve and you've got yourself a cast of characters that really come alive and that you begin to actually care about. Even the Vortigaunts (who now fit better into the visuals with awesome new models and textures) have an increased level of importance and personality.   Another returning favorite character, one you may be able to guess, drops another puzzle in our laps about past events and hints at true histories of certain characters. The sequence is inserted in such a perfect way that makes you feel angered, intrigued, and vaguely helpless towards a future you don't fully understand. This moment along with the awesome introduction to the Advisors and a couple others help set up the story for the future. The fact that the ending is exciting and moving only helps complete the package. The only negative side-effect of this all is that we really, really want to play the next episode so that we can find out what's going on and see how much farther Portal ties in to the whole thing.     Half-Life 2 was special for a lot of reasons, but one of the biggest was the diversity of the levels and how there was never, ever a dull moment. One moment you'd be fighting Combine through the sewers and the next speeding across the beach in a buggy and all the while entering very distinct environments to fight different kinds and different combinations of enemies. Episode Two continues in that tradition by including creepy (and sometimes disgusting) claustrophobic tunnels filled with antlions, expansive outdoor areas and smaller buildings with the new Hunters, large abandoned structures filled with zombies and Combine, and one spectacular final battle which you have to participate in to really appreciate. There really is never a moment where you're going to feel let down or bored. If there's not a fight going on, there's some story happening and conversations to pay attention to. If neither of those things is happening, there's some scene in the distance or background that begs attention. And most of the time, no matter how many conversations you seem to be having, you're probably not but a couple of seconds from the next big battle.     Episode Two is a cornucopia of gaming fun and brings back old favorites and new instant classics. One of the special weapon devices you use towards the end of the game will undoubtedly be coming back for more and we can only hope to see the awesome cage car again though that's less likely. You'll find nothing but familiar weapons in the catalog of damage dealing devices though you will find a couple of new enemies to give you some trouble. There's a new antlion that spits poison at you but the big addition is, without a doubt, the Combine Hunter. These guys are scary. They're happy enough to run you down or shoot you from afar but either way they do a lot of damage and aren't easy to bring down with conventional weapons. Whatever way you take care of them, you'll have fun doing it. Visually these guys are really impressively designed. They're sleek and powerful all at once and reek of malicious alien intelligence.     We also see the return of sidekicks that come with you into battle. Valve has definitely learned some lessons from previous games. The friendly AI not only is useful to have around while managing not to steal your thunder, but also no longer gets in your way and never gets stuck. Whether it's because the pathfinding has been improved or they just decided not to have AI tag along when you're fighting in really cramped spaces, it works. You still get the thrill of being part of bigger and more intense battles without the frustration of having a bunch of idiotic followers clogging up your way. While reeking of ~sure, you run ahead into danger~, it also allows players to feel important and strong when the side characters tell you to run on ahead and take care of the problem.   Another thing that HL2 did so well is eliminate backtracking through levels when you need to get back to an earlier location. Valve smartly places elevators or extra tunnels or something like those to make sure players don't have to trudge through the same spaces and always are seeing something new and important. Episode Two also does a great job repeating the near seamless continuation from one location and level to another. You're never disconnected from your setting, are always on a course to your goal, and feel the progress being made. It's satisfying in a lot of ways. If it wasn't for the little loads that are still scattered throughout levels, we would have no complaints on this count.     It's strange to talk about it last, but Valve has also made some significant improvements to their engine that allow for some really breathtaking moments that involve a lot of physical objects reacting in the right way. Usually when you see structures fall apart, they look blocky and wrong but what they've done in Episode Two is amazing. You'll see the improvements in a couple of places, but we don't want to say when. It's impossible to miss and well worth the surprise.Any way you look at it, Episode Two stands out, even among the Half-Life series, as something special. It may be shorter than the original, but it's a burly experience packed into roughly six hours or so that offers up all the diversity, level design, and thoughtful gameplay we've known while making sure to propel the story forward and leave us wanting more. We definitely think you should pick up Orange Box for Portal (or HL2 and Episode One if you haven't played them) but if you like the series, you need to play this one. This is the addition Half-Life 2 fans have been waiting for. Here's to hoping Valve can keep up the pace and give us Episode Three in the next couple of years.", "date": "Oct 9, 2007"}
