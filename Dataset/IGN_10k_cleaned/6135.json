Microsoft Games Studios has licensed Halo to IN-FUSIO, Nintendo is starting to get into wallpapers and ring tones, and Sony has blessed JAMDAT's SOCOM: US Navy SEALs Mobile Recon, a tie-in with the new PlayStation 2 chapter of the series to be released tomorrow in retail. Developed by Iron Monkey, SOCOM: US Navy SEALs Mobile Recon distills the essence of the multi-million selling console game to a very playable mobile title. While this certainly won't supplant the PS2 experience, it is an excellent companion piece -- as well as a great introduction for newcomers.   In SOCOM: US Navy SEALs Mobile Recon, you control a two man recon team. The point man, Wraith, is a sniper while his second, Bronco, specializes in demolitions. Each team member's expertise comes into play throughout the entire game. For example, Bronco's ability to blow stuff up real good is needed to breaching doors and such, while Wraith's sniping can help clear a path through a level. Wraith's sniping sequences are almost like mini-games themselves, with the screen going black save for the view through a sniper's scope.   Movement in SOCOM: US Navy SEALs Mobile Recon is handled by moving a target over the landscape and pressing the action key to direct the two SEALs. When it comes time to engage in a firefight or stealthily kill from the shadows, the movement target doubles as a reticule. When you place the reticule over an enemy, it turns red and you can press okay to open fire. There is a nice degree of sensitivity involved, as you can nudge the firing reticule toward the head in an attempt to score an instant-kill headshot.   The stealth element is surprisingly useful. While many games that include stealth treat it merely as an afterthought or bullet point for a marketing slick, SOCOM: US Navy SEALs Mobile Recon weaves it into the fabric of the game. There is a certain satisfaction to slinking into the shadows behind a terrorist thug, then watching Wraith unsheathe his blade and plunge it deep into his target's neck. The accompanying spurt of blood is something new for mobile, and for a game that trades in realism like SOCOM: US Navy SEALs Mobile Recon, it works.   SOCOM: US Navy SEALs Mobile Recon also gives players a chance to really open up their weapons with a pair of pure action sequences. Your men pile into the back of a moving truck and squeeze off rounds at targets coming from every direction. After finishing up a particularly stealthy mission, this is a great action chaser.   The production values in SOCOM: US Navy SEALs Mobile Recon are top-notch. The scenery is expertly detailed, with lots of animated touches like dripping water, drying clothes fluttering in the breeze, and birds that scatter at your approach -- just classy stuff. Wraith and Bronco are imbued with a solid number of animations, too. The use of color is also exemplary in SOCOM: US Navy SEALs Mobile Recon; not only are the backdrops rich, but the bright green target reticule never disappears into the scenery. The music and sound effects are also excellent, as well as the short samples of digitized speech when commands are entered successfully.  SOCOM: US Navy SEALs Mobile Recon is a superb mobile game, with great mechanics that almost any player can immediately pick up on. Controlling both soldiers is incredibly easy with the reticule, and the balance of action, stealth, and good ol' tactical fighting is almost perfect. While experienced players will breeze through SOCOM: US Navy SEALs Mobile Recon in just an hour or so, the game has sufficient content to demand replays. And I have to make another mention about the excellent level of detail in the environments -- little touches like that go a long way. Like JAMDAT's DOOM RPG, SOCOM: US Navy SEALs Mobile Recon feels more like a video game that you just happen to play on a cellphone, rather than a video game you can just tell was crammed on to a handset. Don't miss this one.", "date": "Oct 10, 2005"}
