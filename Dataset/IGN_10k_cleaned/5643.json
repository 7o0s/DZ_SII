You can move the target around with the analog stick and need to be on the lookout for any incoming fighters and defense installations.The game features the following modes: Practice Story Team (Multiplayer Story mode) Battle (2 or 4 Player Team Battle)In a departure from games like Star Fox, the camera (ie the ship you're sitting in) will automatically move through the environments. Movement occurs quickly, but looks much too jerky to make you feel like you're really sitting in any kind of craft. Levels range from tunnels deep under the surface of the planet to desolate alien cities and bizarre Martian landscapes. In order to convey the feel of a sci-fi action movie, your ship receives flight transmissions from allied pilots once in a while -- too bad they're text-only. On the positive side, Kemco added a nice feature to the otherwise set motion tracks. Since the game takes place in real-time rendered levels, players can perform limited evasion moves and try to escape enemy fire by pressing the C-Buttons. But even with the evasion function, Knife Edge still makes you feel like you're stuck in one of those old CDi games. In the end, this linear structure and feeling of no control is Knife Edge's biggest downfall. Like many of the FMV titles of yore, the game just gets old much too quickly. It's point and shoot without much variation or strategy. For some players, that may be enough, but we were bored to tears after only 30 minutes of play -- despite the fact that Kemco tried to spice up the gameplay by adding four-player capability and offering multiple paths and difficulty modes in the story mode.GraphicsGun-shooters like Knife Edge have been around for a long time. Although the gameplay hasn't changed much through the years, each new title attracts gamers by offering better graphics and more impressive special effects. Alas, Knife Edge's graphics are a far cry from Jurassic Park, Gunblade, and Virtua Cop. Most of the game is set in the caverns and canyons of Mars, which translates into blurry, low-res environments with little detail and tons of red fog. Special effects are limited to lame sprite explosions and a few decent transparency effects, and despite the fact that everything is on rails, slowdown lurks around every corner. There are a few cool vehicles and cut-scenes here and there, but everything looks flat (no lighting effects whatsoever) and much too bland.SoundSound effects are equally uneventful. The music sounds a lot like you would expect a Japanese shooting game to sound: synth pop with fast drum beats lots of brass and sawtooth leads. Sound effects are average, at best, and the explosions are entirely too wimpy. The best thing we can say about the sound department is that it's in stereo.Let's face it, the only saving grace of many lightgun shooters is the fact that you actually feel like you're aiming a realistic gun at targets. In Knife Edge, this one important element is removed, which leaves you sitting in front of the TV, staring at hundreds of identical looking spaceships flying towards you. Getting hit or shooting down an enemy craft should be exciting, but it just isn't, even with multiple players. I appreciate all the features and modes Kemco added to make the title stand out, but Knife Edge just doesn't come together as a game. If on-rails shooters are your kind of thing, give this one a rent. But everything is so dreadfully average and uneventful that it might make more sense to rent a good '50s sci-fi flick instead. The effects are a lot better, too...", "date": "Nov 12, 1998"}
