Conspiracy has brought The Land Before Time to GBA in a platformer that unfortunately doesn't capture much of the fascinating aspects of playing with dinosaurs (namely, that they're really, really big), but it does have some strong play mechanics -- in a kids' game, that's gigantic all by itself.  Features  Journey through prehistoric worlds in an all new The Land Before Time story Play as four different dinosaur characters Includes mini-game challenges Only for Game Boy Advance   Lost somewhere in the Great Beyond are the plucky dinosaur Littlefoot's three friends -- bad news, considering they're all on their way to the Great Valley to escape extinction. It's up to you to save them all across five sprawling stages and in a few encounters with fearsome bosses.  Developer Full Fat, who are most known for Acclaim's 3D BMX games, put these dinos on the GBA for this adventure, but even though it's a kids' game, they still are working in an amped-up mode here. I was expecting to boot the game up to big, lumbering dinosaurs, but instead, the gameplay is more Sonic The Hedgehog than Jurassic Park. Littlefoot is fleet-footed, leaping and spinning and double-jumping all around the levels. It's a very strange gameplay mechanic for a dino game -- you get the feeling that the devs just grafted another platforming engine onto the license -- but it's also very strong and tight gameplay nevertheless. I have no idea why there's an attack button -- it does virtually nothing -- and all the characters play essentially the same despite claims in the manual that they have different abilities (it's very generic game design overall), but the core play is accurate and fun. Kids' games are usually blistering pain, but the control was surprisingly good here.  What isn't as strong is the level design. It plays like a Sonic replica, and unfortunately, it also plays as one, with blind leaps and puzzling stage layouts. The first stage has directional arrows, but after that, you're on your own to figure out where you're going and whether your just going around in circles (yes -- it's a left-to-right side-scroller, but you still get lost when you can't tell how far down a bottomless pit goes before there's no more platforms to save your life while exploring.) There's a lot of problems of balance -- the first stage is a bit of an endurance test until you rescue your pals (complete with some REALLY tough jumps), then the other stages are a breeze so long as you can keep your bearings, and the mini-games where you save your pals are fun, but can be complete torture for little kids as big kids like me. The difficulty also doesn't do anything to make the game any easier -- it's not a tough game by any means, but for the really young kids that still like these critters, things could have been a lot less challenging.  Visually, the game is on par with kids' titles, and it is hurt in some ways by the strange gameplay design -- Littlefoot and his dino pals are very small sprites, which is again strange for a dinosaur game. However, the sprites are drawn well, and the backgrounds get to stand out well since the main characters are smaller. Parallax scrolling and lush colors paint a pretty picture. (One of the lacking special effects -- the dithered waterfall that obscures your view in the second stage -- does not, but the large enemy bosses will make up for it for the kids waiting for Sharp Tooth and other big baddies.) Full Fat turned in a nice MUSYX score, which is always great to hear such higher-quality audio on GBA, especially in a kids' game. The low-res sound effects are few and far between, so that's not such a problem. Also, as far as presentation goes, I really liked that Littlefoot has his flying pal Petrie always flittering about -- not so necessary, but a nice addition.Reviewing kids games all boils down not to whether you liked the game or not, but whether kids will like the game. In this case, I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure that kids into The Land Before Time would. The stage design is just a bit too tricky and problematic, and the difficulty control doesn't even it out for it to be fun for the adolescents who love these characters. Bump the score up maybe a half-point in your mind (although I'm hesitant to suggest that with level designs that are generic and frustrating) if your kids are great gamers and also rabid fans of The Land Before Time, but I don't think that describes any kid I know.", "date": "Oct 21, 2002"}
