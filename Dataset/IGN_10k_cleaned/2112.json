Out are the days when the acronym THQ (for Toy Headquarters) was solely associated with lackluster Game Boy and franchise titles, and in are the days of the gamer's game.  With this in mind, it's no wonder that Red Faction wasn't content with being just another shooter. A poster-boy for the company, the game was both expected and in fact heralded as being the next technological and indeed contextual revolution in the genre. And why not? With an engine that allows for the arbitrary modification and destruction of the environment, realistic physics applied to particles, flowing water, wind, AI promised to be more lethal than that of Half-Life, an involved storyline, and the credentials of people who worked on both Freespace and the first two Descents, the game was sure to cash in and break the bank. So, did it deliver? Yes, and no.  First off, just to clear the air and stave off the rabid fanboys, it must be known right off the bat that this game is bleeding darn fun. I mean poking monkeys in a barrel, teasing tethered dogs kind of fun (for those raised outside of the sticks, that means a grand old time). With that said...  The most talked about and single distinguishing feature of the game has to be its Geo-Mod technology. Short for geometry modification, this nifty bit of programming allows for holes to be torn out of and blown through ~most~ walls in the game. I use the term most loosely as in fact a great many areas are indestructible; still, the one found in Red Faction is a far more interactive environment (on this fundamental level anyway) than anything else previously seen in the genre. Geo-Modding also, strangely enough, adds very little in terms of actual play dynamics. You'd think the possibilities spawned from the ability to blow through any wall into adjoining rooms and circumvent any door would be staggering, but alas, the game fails to achieve its full potential, and we are instead left with an implementation that rarely, if ever, uses the game's foundation in a useful manner. There are only a scant few instances where you can blow a hole through a wall to circumvent a locked door (as 99.9% of the doors are unlocked as is) and even fewer instances where the toppling or collapsing of structures has any bearing or relevance on the game (only one instance where the much vaunted ~blowing out a bridge~ situation actually comes into play).  Geo-Modding in combat is also practically useless, aside from the debris resulting from explosions (equivalent to a blast radius), the use of Geo-Modding to defeat enemies rarely comes into play; partly attributed to the fact that only four weapons, aside from the vehicles, are able to inflict environmental pain, and the fact that just the explosion alone from your weapon will kill some fools anyway, so who in the heck cares about the holes around them?  Now, though the technology may not be all that revolutionary, or even useful, it still manages to be cool. Missing a hapless guard with a rocket and watching it leave a crater in the impacted wall behind him is just right. It should thus not be taken as a say all end all to the game, but rather as a compliment to the rest of the experience, frosting on the proverbial cake.  The technology also helps to augment the generally good, but sometimes bland, almost PS2ish graphics. Textures seem a little less detailed than they could have been and the title is completely devoid of whiz-bang graphical touches such as detail texturing, bump-mapping, destructible lighting, and all that other stuff that has the general effect of making things purdy-er. Thankfully, the generally wicked particle effects, solid character detail, and little details a la shattering glass, leave a sweet taste in a mouth that could have otherwise been spoiled by downside to a simultaneous cross-platform development cycle. It doesn't hurt (well at least not you) that the death animations, for the shotgun especially, are some of the best around. Again, we see the ~feel factor~ in full effect. Vaulting over a table and laying a double barreled blast squarely into the chest of one of Ultor's legions of goon only to see him violently fly back is astonishing, and again, altogether right. The sense of bullet impaction, however morbid it may sound, is dead on.   Story-wise, the game revolves around an excellent mesh of Total Recall and the miner's revolts of a small town USA not a hundred years ago. The evil Ultor corporation's Martian mining operation isn't exactly Kosher (mysterious plague killing a whole bunch of people already living in brutal conditions). Too bad, you, as the game's protagonist, Parker, had the brilliant idea of joining this outfit as one of the company's thousands of guinea pigs, er...miners.   Eventually the miners canst takes no more and a full on revolt starts. Sucky for the game, the implementation of said revolt is the equivalent of me sticking my thumb in my butt and running around calling myself a tough miner. See, you apparently got this complex full of supposedly hard-as-nails miners, but all we get are a few sparsely populated areas, some bad acting, an incoherent and anti-climatic story, and what few NPC skirmishes there are ending immediately within three seconds of their onset with all miners dying.  Eventually (approximately thirty minutes into the game), you'll want everyone to just shut up so that you can get back to some uninterrupted shooting. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Plague, schmague. Just stop moving that thing on your face that emits noise and let me get back to the fun, which is of course the actual gameplay.  Gameplay is fast, intense, relentless, and tooth chatteringly cool. 15 weapons, two ~stealth~ missions, and brief control of five vehicles round out a combat system that is always satisfying, but at times a tad unfair.   The weapons, while a standard lot of FPS destruction, are, on an individual basis, for the most part enjoyable and well balanced. The shotgun, as mentioned, just feels right. Pumping off double-barreled rounds or engaging its fully automatic secondary fire is an exercise in the release of all of life's frustrations. Equally so, assault rifle corridor encounters with enemies are intense as can be. A majority of the game's weapons are actually really fun to use, sadly a few of them are pretty much pointless. The riot shield, for instance is good for measuring the length of your character's forearm, as it not only appears to block jack, but also has the amazing tendency to be useless in combat, unless you enjoy dying. Why a combination of the shield with the control baton or pistol was not implemented is beyond me. The not living up to its potential bug strikes again.   Of the five vehicles and two turret types, the driller is pretty much never utilized and the rest are healthy and playable additions to the game. Like a lot of what comprises Red Faction, they should be taken as additions to the core gameplay of which the title rotates around, and not games unto themselves.   Regardless of the brevity of vehicle and turret interaction, the game makes up for it all in the form of combat. The AI is uncannily effective at creating an enjoyable experience. Fending off six to eight mercs with a precision rifle, sending each reeling into the arms of death or cowering behind cover whilst dodging rockets and tripping over Geo-Modded holes is just fun. The AI itself is centered entirely around combat and does not take stealthy factors into consideration. In fact, even the undercover missions themselves consist of avoidance as opposed to intelligence (your identity only being revealed if a distance radius is crossed). This is not the best of things for games like Thief or Deus Ex, but for the action intensive Red Faction, where a responsive and deadly combat AI is preferable to one with casual intelligence, it works beautifully   All this action is complimented by remarkably crisp and vibrant sound effects. Like all noteworthy aspects of the title, the sound feels good. The rumbling of the assault rifle, pop of the shotgun, rattling of the chain link fence, and cries of agony from fallen guards are all conveyed well to say the least. Music, while sometimes nonexistent, is also either pleasing, ambient, or unnoticed. The best compliments I can think of as the only music I, and a lot of other gamers tend to remember in-game are the tracks that annoy (a nightmarish Daytona USA ~Blue, Blue Sky~ theme comes to mind). It's unfortunate then, that, as mentioned, some of the voice acting is borderline atrocious. Why, oh why does Parker have to sound like such an ignorant motard? Was it also really necessary to make Eos such a nag? Her shrill, I'm so tough voice rattle my core and fills me with the urge to hit stuff... Must... Hit... Stuff.     In terms of multiplayer, Red Faction weighs in with a smattering of the obligatory first person shooter set of options and modes found anywhere else, only with the game's trademark Geo-Modding functionality that allows for some really tense and interesting match-ups. Lacking modes that hearken to the fad of a more team-based gameplay, Red Faction, with its Geo-Moddable multiplayer, still manages to add breath of fresh air to the genre, even more so than its single-player component since players are actually able to discern when and how to use geo-modding in a relevant, advantageous manner.   So we're left with a remarkably fun game whose technical, story, and to some extent weapon and vehicle potential aren't implemented to the fullest. All of these things, while impressive as they are, weren't designed to be taken as a game in and of themselves, but are instead compliments to the total experience. It's therefore not a physics simulation where the entire objective is to blow walls up, nor is it a story-driven quest, nor a vehicular game. It's an intense as all hell action game with a whole lot of extras. Even as a standard first person shooter, without the vehicles, Geo-Mods and such, the game would still be good because of one simple and factor, paramount above all others...Gameplay. It's all about the gameplay, and when you crank this baby to hard, or God forbid, im-freaking-possible, you'll find the gameplay to keep you going for hours piled upon days, piled upon weeks.  -- Ivan Sulic", "date": "Sep 18, 2001"}
