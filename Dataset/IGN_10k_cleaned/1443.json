In fact, in the company's latest attempt at trying to produce a quality motocross game, it has decided to not only use the McGrath name again but has also went out and got another motocross superstar by the name of Travis Pastrana to put his name on the product. The end result is Freestyle Motocross: McGrath vs. Pastrana, a title that pits old against new and melds standard motocross racing with more adventurous freestyle motocross.   While this is a very good idea and the product has loads of potential, the promise of the game is never met and the end result is a game that is almost completely worthless and is a complete slap on the face of the game's two namesakes. Better yet, it's a complete slap on the face to anyone who happens to buy the game because of they're fans of either McGrath or Pastrana, as the game's two endorsers are still getting paid for it regardless of how worthless the product happens to be.   Gameplay Sure, the idea of having regular motocross racing and some freestyle motocross events seems like a good one and could be quite enjoyable, but it doesn't work if the game's not any good. That's the case with McGrath vs. Pastrana, the game is completely boring and there's just not a lot of fun to be had here. The game's biggest problem is that the control of the motocross bikes is very clunky and unresponsive and there's no skill whatsoever needed in racing around the tracks or pulling off insane tricks.   While it's cool that there's a lot of tricks at your disposal, the way that you pull them off (press a direction plus a button) doesn't really reward players for having any skill and the same thing can be said with racing around the tracks. There's never a time during any of the races on any of the levels that players will need to let go of the gas or put on the breaks. Pressing the L1 or R1 buttons for doing an extreme turn can easily conquer the toughest corners in the game and this just makes for very little racing excitement.   Graphics The worst aspect of McGrath vs. Pastrana has got to be its extremely low-budget graphics, which are some of the worst looking that we've seen on the system in quite some time. What makes things worse is that the framerate is so bad and the textures are so low-res and flat out ugly that it actually hurts the gameplay. The choppy framerate is probably the reason that the control feels so weird and the low-res textures sometimes makes it difficult to see where the next turn in the track is headed.   And if crappy textures and a near complete lack of framerate isn't enough to make you lose your lunch, then maybe the fact that the game has a heap of pop-up and clipping problems might throw you over the edge. Trees, mountains, the track and other riders will often pop-up no more than 10 or 15 yards in front of your rider and this is completely unforgivable for a game released on the PlayStation in its 5th year.   Sound  As if the bad gameplay and graphics weren't enough, Acclaim has decided to throw in some really horrible audio, as well. While the music is actually really good and fun to listen to, the audio experience is completely destroyed by engine noises that sound like you're riding a 20-year-old broken down lawnmower instead of a real 125 cc or higher dirt bike. The bikes constantly sound like they're dying on you throughout the race and it really gets annoying even after your very first lap.  There are not really any redeeming qualities about this game and there's nothing here that makes it a worthwhile purchase for anyone, even diehard fans of McGrath and Pastrana or their friends and family. The game is ugly, it's a pain in the ass to play, it has horrible audio and is a completely nauseating experience. Stay away from this game and don't even waste any of your time renting it. There's no reason to play this game.", "date": "Nov 8, 2000"}
