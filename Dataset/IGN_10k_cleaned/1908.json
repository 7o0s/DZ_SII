Many of our younger readers probably never played the Genesis Spider-Man games, most of which were quite excellent with a couple of exceptions (i.e. Arcade's Revenge).  So, when Spider-Man released on the PlayStation, many claimed it as the best video game incarnation of everyone's favorite neighborhood crime-fighter.  I, however, was not one of them.  Maybe I'm too much of an old-schooler but Spider-Man for the PlayStation was a good game,  not stellar as many reviews have called it out to be.  Neversoft did an excellent job of engrossing players into the role of Spider-Man including myself; when I shot a webline to swing from building to building, I hummed the 70's Spider-Man theme to myself in joy.  However, the PS Spider-Man was easy and had quite a few problems in the combination of control and camera angles.  The Dreamcast version of Spider-Man looks slightly better than the PlayStation version and while you still get a rush from being the webcrawler, the game drops a few points from being spectacular due to the same control and camera problems found in the original game.  For those unfamiliar with the story behind the game, you take the role as the amazing Spider-Man and as with the bad luck that seems to follow our webhead often, you've been framed for robbing a bank. And while you're dealing with the police hunting you down, old enemies are out to squash you for good.  These include the classic enemies of Spider-Man including Rhino, Scorpion, Mysterio, and Doctor Octopus, as well as the newer foes of Venom and Carnage.  Along the way, other Marvel heroes will drop in for their cameo shots, including Black Cat and Daredevil, to give you advice and direction as you try to clear your name and save the city from the dark plans of the villains.  To this end, you're going to need all the abilities of the webcrawler... and then some.  The developers have added a few new powers that aren't part of Spider-Man's normal arsenal, but are pretty darn useful.  These include the stunning power of Impact Webbing, the Web Dome that acts as both as shield and as a area blast weapon, and the Web Spikes that give Spider-Man more power to his punches.  Of course, you don't have to always use these fancy attacks if you're the more ~direct~ type.  And Spidey has a decent assortment of hand-to-hand attacks; we're not talking anything on a Street Fighter level, but you can mix up punch and kick attacks, as well as delivering hilarious throw techniques.  And of course, Spider-Man comes complete with his wall-crawling skills that are necessary to get through some of the areas and his web-slinging skills.  For that matter, it's often better to save your webbing for movement as Spider-Man's special web attacks can often drain his webbing quickly.  And due to Spider-Man's super strength, he'll be able to pick-up large objects, both for puzzle sequences as well as weapons; there's something about tossing lounge chairs on top of thugs.  One of the major problems that the developers had to overcome was dizzying camera angles when Spider-Man crawls up the wall, on the ceiling, into small shafts, and so forth.  This is where the main problem of the game appears; the controls change depending upon the camera angle.  For example, you could be crawling left on the ceiling with the camera trailing you and if you stop for a brief moment, the camera angle will change as well as the controls.  If you were crawling up a wall and the camera changes, all of a sudden, pressing up on the controls make you go down!  While you can avoid this confusion by simply not moving when the camera decides to shift, it certainly gets annoying.  There are a few collision problems later in the game, but for the most part, it's the combination of the camera angle shifting while you move that frustrates a otherwise fun gameplay experience.  Obviously, the question will be asked on how much better the Dreamcast version looks over the PlayStation version.  There's no doubt that the DC version of Spider-Man look better than the PS version, but not by a whole lot.  Cleaner textures and more colors are about as much as one can brag on the Dreamcast version, though that applies to both the gameplay visuals as well as the FMV sequences between stages.  The frame rate seems to be marginally improved, so don't expect the characters to animate any better.  So in the end, the game looks better than the PS version but in this time of the Dreamcast evolution, one was hoping for a lot more.  My only other major gripe with Spider-Man is that it's a bit too easy for my taste.  Puzzles are pretty simple and most enemies have predictable patterns.  The only portion that gave me a little trouble was the boss fight with Mysterio, and that was hardly any.  Still, Spider-Man is good fun for anyone with a Dreamcast that hasn't played the PlayStation version and if you can get past the confusing camera and controls, you'll have a swinging good time.", "date": "Apr 18, 2001"}
