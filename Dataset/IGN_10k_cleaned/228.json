I can't tell you how much I had hoped this great comic book turned PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC game would be, and now that I have a final copy, I am simply flabbergasted at how awful it looks and plays.   Why should I be so disappointed? After all, Acclaim, with one exception (WWF Attitude) is clearly focusing its best games on the Nintendo 64, not on the PlayStation. Why did Acclaim try to force this game onto PlayStation, while the PC and Nintendo 64 versions look, play, and feel so good  and so much better? Acclaim should have simply dropped it from the PlayStation lineup altogether. You know how we always say graphics don't make a game? Well, here, they ruin it to such a degree the gameplay is indeed affected. The frame rate, the character models, the textures and the control, they're all crap. I'm sorry, I shouldn't rip on this game  especially because I was prepared to like it -- but it simply isn't worth buying. Just like any gamer out there who was excited about an upcoming game and was angry when they realized it didn't match the hype, I am truly stung by this final product.  Story  Just like Turok and Armorines, the concept of Shadow Man was inspired by an Acclaim/Valiant comic book of the same name. Brought into the complete, giant 3D world, Shadow Man, aka Mike LeRoi, is a dead man powered by voodoo magic and capable of walking though limbo as well as manifesting on earth. The storyline, one of the better aspects of the game, follows the seemingly hopeless adventures of LeRoi as he struggles to prevent the apocalypse from destroying the world and simultaneously confronting the awful mess that he calls his so-called ~life.~   LeRoi was a failing English student who left college in Louisiana and moved to Chicago to drive a cab. While at work one day in 1991, one of LeRoi's passengers is killed in a gang-style tragedy, and leaves behind $20,000 in the back seat. Knicking the cash with aspirations to redeem himself in front of his family and friends, LeRoi moves back to New Orleans. That of course is the beginning of his problems.  The crime syndicate who owned the money comes after LeRoi and his family, and kills them  and LeRoi somehow lives through it. To protect himself from the same cold-blooded killers that offed his family, LeRoi gains the assistance of a voodoo priest, for whom he eventually becomes a slave.   But again, LeRoi's life changes drastically. A voodoo priestess by the name of Mamma Nettie steals him away and physically buries ~The Mask of Shadows,~ a powerful voodoo icon, into his chest. LeRoi now must serve Mamma Nettie's every demand. The Mask of Shadows enables LeRoi the power to shift to Shadow Man, a being who can travel to a world beyond the living called Deadside. After waking from a prophetic nightmare, Nettie commands LeRoi to save the world from the oncoming apocalypse, and that is where you begin the game.   The story, which is the same on all media (N64, PC and PS), is great. It's big and sweeping, and full of prophecy and damnation, with of course an anti-hero who does get to redeem himself in a strange kind of way. Aside from the big sprawling landscapes, commanding replay value, and some extremely evil bosses, I was hooked from the first time I played it...on the Nintendo 64. And then I played the PlayStation version and turned all pale, weak, and sad. I looked for a knife to slit my throat, but my wife knew what I was going to do (having seen me this suicidal before after playing other bad games), so I just sat there and pulled out my remaining hair, one strand at a time. Still, the story does drive the game and it excites and rewards you each time you break through to a new level. You just won't want to see it on the PlayStation.  Gameplay, Graphics, Sound...Everything Shadow Man's quest is filled with enemies to fight, Dark Souls and Cadeaux to collect, worlds to open and explore, and super dark serial killers to destroy. Oh, and there's that little thing about the Apocalypse, too. What's great about Shadow Man is that he's capable of many actions and he eventually gets a bucket load of killer weapons. His actions include walking, running, jumping, rope climbing, shooting and using various weapons (from which he can shoot some more), climbing, ledge hanging, and a few weird little voodoo things he does with Nattie that we shouldn't let the little kids no about just yet. Actually, Soul Reaver's Raziel contains more moves and controls far better, not to mention has having better animations for them. Being a non-linear quest, players move through the enormous worlds that are great looking on any other system except PlayStation, and locate all sorts of hidden treasures, extras, and bonuses on secret hills, in special tunnels, and in various hard-to-find locations. Deadside is fabulous looking, and coupled with strange music and creepy textures and undulating hills, waterfalls, and caverns, a fantastic mood settles down upon you like a ghost breathing down your neck.   Unfortunately, all of these aspects are severely hampered by a phenomenally bad frame rate that cripples the game more than I can say. What happens here is that the camera, Shadow Man himself, and all of the enemies, be they dogs, zombies, or bosses, all move in a staggered, stilted, slowed down fashion. To say that the actions aren't in synch with the commands is a putting in subtly. But wait until you see the in-game renders and movies! Remember when you were in first grade and the projector started burning the film and it slowed down and then burnt into a crisp? The entire game moves so badly you're forced into wondering whether there's something technically wrong with it. Of course, there isn't. It's a final product. Bad, slow claymation is a strong competitor to these graphics.   But the worst aspect of this game is that on any other system it's as big, dark, and deep as Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is on PlayStation. And it's a good game! But you simply won't want to bear through the horrendous first five minutes to experience it on PlayStation. I played both the Nintendo and PlayStation versions one after another while I was at home and they simply don't compare in graphics, sound, gameplay, control, you name it. First, the PlayStation version was so dark on my TV that I had to crank the brightness to the maximum. That didn't work at all, so I closed the shutters and turned off all the lights reduce the glare, but that didn't work either. That's when I discovered that the N64 version had something the PS version didn't have, an in-game brightness meter in the option menu. Worse is that the sound on the N64 version is better than it is on the PS version, which must be a first in history! Voices are so out of synch that Godzilla voiceovers sound like a symphony in comparison. My honest opinion is that Shadow man is a great game -- but not on PlayStation. It's close to total failure. In fact, if you have a Nintendo 64 or a PC, and you really want the game, buy it on that system. Not on the PlayStation. Shadow Man, if it could handle being on the PlayStation, would have received a score in the mid- to high- 8s. As it is, well, you can see the score. Some may find my comments to be harsh, but I feel just like any fan who has paid good money for a game and been disappointed and I didn't put down a dime. Thankfully, all is not lost. There are other alternatives to reaping evil adventures this year. You can buy Soul Reaver on PlayStation (or the PC for that matter), or you can buy Shadow Man on Nintendo 64 or the PC, two systems on which it looks and plays brilliantly.", "date": "Sep 11, 1999"}
