If any of us actually got our hands on a brand new Toyota MR-Spyder, one of the handful of officially licensed vehicles in Titus' Roadsters, there would be more posturing and fronting going on than powersliding. But when you're coming up with another racing game for the N64, snooty drivers in snazzy ragtop two-seaters is as good an idea as any. Roadsters turns out to be a surprisingly fun game even if it lacks the sophisticated physics and luscious graphics of World Driver Championship or the barrel rolling, death defying arcade action of the San Francisco Rush series.  Gameplay You've got your typical career and quick race modes so that you can either earn some of the game's well kept secrets or hop right into the action. The career mode forces you to manage your money a la Gran Turismo so that you have to buy and upgrade your vehicles to keep up with the competition while keeping mind other expenses like entry fees. You'll start off with very little dough and a small selection of vehicles to choose from. Grabbing bigger pieces of the pot from the highest paying racing circuits will put you well on your way to riding around in  some of the never-seen-before-on-American-soil concept cars.  In fact the licensed cars really boost the appeal of this game. While we love the new Volkswagen Beetle as much as the next videogame slacker, it's kind of sad that it was the only licensed road vehicle to appear in an N64 game besides those found in Titus' Automobili Lamborghini and now Roadsters. You will get to feel the excitement of racing models from Ford, Renault, Mitsubishi, TVR, Lotus, Toyota and Wiesmann among others. While an officially licensed vehicle doesn't control any better or worse than an anonymous scrub car, there is something that makes you grit your teeth a little harder and handle the curves a little better when you know you that there's a car just like the one you're controlling now sitting on a lot somewhere near you. Not all of the cars are licensed, so there are BMW and Mercedes-Benz knock-offs with silly names that look very good nonetheless.  The physics of  Roadsters are pretty good but feel, for lack of a better word, scattered. When you compare the handling of different cars, with different weights and engines and drive in different conditions like rain and snow, the differences should still be governed by the gravity and physics of planet Earth. In Roadsters, you can go from driving a little Alfa Romeo around a dry track to driving a Ginetta around in snow, and it can feel like you're playing a totally different videogame. Compare this to World Driver where the differences between vehicles are more subtle. The Viper clone in WDC is tougher to steer than most of the GT2, but it won't feel like a foreign task. Furthermore, if you've earned enough points to drive it, you will have to be a good enough driver to handle it.  In Roadsters, you can go from one extreme to the other within just a few races.   This is okay if the physics remain more or less the same and you're just after the arcade experience of battling it out with bots with cheesy A.I. on their side like in Rush.  However, if Titus is trying to offer a simulation experience where the object is to follow the rules of real life driving, then you've got to have a racing engine that rewards the meticulous and attentive player.    This is the dilemma of Roadsters. It's to ~simmy~ to be arcade and to ~arcadey~ to be a sim as far as physics are concerned. If you don't care about stuff like that and racing is just racing to you, then this title is a more than capable of keeping you entertained.  Graphics The best looking part of the game, and we're sure Titus is well aware of this, is the vehicle selection screen. Dozens of highly polished slick looking automobiles rotating slowly on a reflective checkerboard floor is to racing fans and testosterone heavy gamers what a waterfall or rainbow is to most other people. It has a hypnotic, calming effect that makes you want to find lots of money so that you can buy a real one for yourself.....and drive it too fast for you own good.  The reality of the in-game graphics is that you're presented with a medium resolution, semi-smooth running game that looks slightly better than most other N64 racers out there. The framerate hovers very near 30fps most of the time, but a weather effect like rain makes things look a little ugly. Similarly, using the first person driving perspective while using the rearview mirror option will actually make the game run slower than the standard third person point of view. For best results, use first person view sans rearview mirror on a nice sunny day.   There usually aren't many animations to keep track of in a racing game but Roadsters not only has the helicopters and planes that have become common in so many other racers, but for the first time ever, we get driver animations. Remember these cars are convertibles so you can see your little driver dude or dudette actually sitting in the seat, turning the wheel and gesturing to other racers when they come close to each other. Very cool. This is definitely something we would've complained about if Titus had not included in the game. It almost makes you wonder which came first the driver animations or the convertible cars.  The pit stop animations are cool as hell and only make us wonder why they were left out of NASCAR 2000 Sound The variety of engine sounds are a little stale and the music is thankfully defaulted to play very low in the background. The collision sounds are very basic and not varied enough to match all of the potential sounds of bumpers, fenders, tires and doors bumping into each other.  The best sound comes from the great sound samples of the drivers. The personalities you're racing as and those you're racing against all have things they like to say as they whiz by. Snide remarks and other laughs and chuckles all done in appropriately stereotypical accents add a little spice to the game if you can overlook some of the offensive parts.  Roadsters is actually in the upper half of racing games available on the N64. I was actually pleasantly surprised because the concept of convertible racing doesn't exactly excite me as a game player even though it would be the great thing ever if it happened in real life. Titus took bits and pieces from some of the best racing games out there, but they didn't take all of the best parts and they didn't necessarily integrate them in the best possible way. Simply put I like the licensed vehicles, the buying-selling-upgrading elements and the vehicle selection screen. That may not seem like much, but there's isn't too much more you can expect from a racing game. If you have a lot of racers already, definitely rent this one before buying. If you want a recent example of a typical N64 racer, Roadsters is a good entry.", "date": "Jan 7, 2000"}
