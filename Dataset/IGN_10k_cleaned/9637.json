Super Mario Sunshine came close, but even the interesting new FLUDD mechanic and tropical setting couldn't disguise the fact that it was really just a remix of Super Mario 64, complete with similar styles of challenges and many of the same drawbacks.It's a challenge familiar to developers around the world. How do you create a sequel in a hugely popular and iconic series that actually takes a significant step forward, without losing what made the series great in the first place? Thankfully, Nintendo found a solution, and it can be summed up in this one-line, Hollywood-style pitch: ~It's Mario, but in space.~ Thankfully, what could have - in the hands of a lesser development team - been a desperate gambit to inject some new life into the series has turned out to be the complete opposite. Setting this game in space has given Nintendo free rein to throw traditional level designs out the window, and to focus solely on fun and challenge. In short, Nintendo has redefined the genre, and has done it with style and vivacity.LoadingPlayIn a refreshing break from the norm, the game opens with Mario down on his luck. It seems his last (little-known) adventure - Mario Gets Loaded - ended in a major downer. The kind of downer where you wake up in the gutter, brown bottle in hand, with three days of vomit-caked stubble. Nah, just kidding - it's the usual fare. Mario is on his way to Peach's castle when Bowser, at the head of an armada of ships, pulls Peach's entire castle out of the ground (again) and whisks it away to the centre of the Universe. Cue another Mario rescue mission.The difference this time, however, is that Mario soon befriends the Lumas, a race of celestial star-shaped beings, who take him to their towering, multi-tiered spaceship/observatory. Using this as a base, Mario must rescue Power Stars and Grand Stars from a whole series of solar systems (where each orbiting location is - confusingly enough - called a 'Galaxy'). As in Super Mario 64, as he collects more Power Stars, more galaxies become available, while the Grand Stars - earned by defeating the boss in each solar system, are used to power up the spaceship. Collect them all and the ship will have enough power to journey to the centre of the Universe to rescue Peach. Or, as Rosalina, the ship's mysterious leader calls her, Mario's ~special one.~As you might expect, it's an excuse for the action, but the familiar hub system works wonderfully well, and you'll always have a host of missions to choose from at any one time. While many of the galaxies have a number of stars to be found, there are a heap of one-shots as well, and it all adds up to a dizzying array of gameplay. Indeed, it's this flexibility in overall structure that has allowed Nintendo to really have fun with every level. Forget the regimented eight red coins and 100 gold coins missions of previous games - in Super Mario Galaxy every star is distinct, and any concept, no matter how quirky, can be turned into a level. The result is level design that's often a joyous departure from the norm and gratifyingly eclectic.Of course, the main reason the level design is so interesting is the simple fact that the game's set in space, so there's no context required for each level, nor do different sections even need to be linked. Simply beat one section then zoom through the air to the next one. It's liberating, and somewhat counter-intuitively, not at all disjointed, largely thanks to the underlying Mario-ness of both the gameplay and the visual design.Indeed, Super Mario Galaxy is very much built on the foundation of the previous games. All of Mario's moves are present and accounted for - the triple jump, the u-turn jump, wall jumps, the backflip and butt stomp, you're just using them in environments that range from familiar to wildly different. Many of the galaxies, for instance, are comprised of a series of planetoids with their own gravity. Simply being able to run all the way around a planet's surface, and jump from planet to planet gives this game a completely new outlook on the concept of what a platformer can be. Puzzles and challenges in this brave new world are often self-contained, bite-sized nuggets of gameplay to beat then move on.Other sections are presented from side-on; 2D challenges where Mario must climb a sheer wall, using wall jumps and tornados for height, or where gravity changes dynamically, again altering the way you explore and interact with the environment. Still other levels see Mario grappling from point to point through space, or running through an environment where platforms are snapped in ahead of him, or where the world only exists in roaming spotlights surrounded by an inky black void. Then there are the many and varied boss and mini-boss encounters, which are never anything less than a joy to play even if they are generally a little on the easy side.It's a design tour de force, and so intuitive that you'll breeze through the first seven or eight hours, with the challenge only stepping up after that. Along the way Mario will also swim and fly, and transform into different variations, such as Spring Mario and Ice Mario. There are just so many little nuggets of invention to be relished in this title. A couple of rooms in the game, for instance, see Mario running up the walls and across the ceiling, following a pattern of notes which bang out a classic Mario tune.While Super Mario Galaxy can be finished with 60 stars, it's the other 60 that will prove to be the real challenge in this game. Not only are there a huge number of hidden stars to find, but Nintendo has also included a number of tweaked challenges, in the form of 'Prankster Comets' which move from galaxy to galaxy. You may have to beat a level with faster moving enemies and platforms, beat a mini-boss with only one life, race a mirror Mario to the finish line, or simply beat a level within a time limit. They're a fantastic inclusion, and you'd be surprised how much more challenging levels become with modifiers. Then there are the Trial Galaxies and the role certain staple characters play in the game, but you can discover those yourselves.This is a game with countless styles of challenges - the old school mixed irresistibly with the new, where it feels like there's a fresh concept, or a fresh take on an old concept around every corner. It's almost embarrassing how many new ideas and inventive touches Nintendo's EAD Tokyo team has managed to pack into the one game. Embarrassing for other developers that is.It's also embarrassing how effortlessly the camera system works. For a game that's constantly playing with your orientation and the layout of its spaces, it's amazing that a largely automated camera system is so seamless. Indeed, it's very rare that you can't see what you need to see, with only a couple of hiccoughs when swimming and flying.The controls have been very cleverly implemented. Motion sensing, for instance, has only been used where it will enhance the feel of the game. A flick of the wrist to spin Mario on the spot, for instance, gives the controls a gratifyingly tactile touch. Whether you're flicking to send a Goomba spinning away on its head (which can then be followed up with a gorgeously animated punt kick), flicking at the apex of a jump for a little more height, flicking to send Mario spinning around a wandering vine, or flicking at a star jump point to send Mario careening through space to a new area, it feels natural and necessary. The game also makes great use of the Wiimote's infrared capabilities, with the pointer used to latch on to grapple points in the sky, to aim cannons, to pull Mario back and vault him from Sling Pods, and, of course, for collecting Star Bits. It's all effortlessly intuitive.While Super Mario Galaxy doesn't have the eight red coins or 100 coins missions (well, not in every level at least), it's every bit a collect 'em up. In fact, the collection component is more compelling and integral than ever, thanks to a couple of smart decisions. First of all, coins are tied into Mario's health. Most of the time he'll only have three health segments, so nabbing a coin or two whenever you take a hit is paramount. Secondly, the world is full of Star Bits! These bit-sized nuggets of snacky happiness are collected by running over them, or - more likely - moving your on-screen pointer over them. There's something so innately satisfying about hoovering up every Star Bit you can find with the Wiimote, and Star Bits can be used in a number of ways, such as shooting them at (some) enemies to stun them and feeding hungry Lumas to open up new planets and galaxies. Oh, and apparently they taste like honey. In a deft touch, EAD Tokyo even gives you some control over your collecting. Headbop a Goomba, for instance, and you'll get a coin, whereas using the spin attack then punt will net you Star Bits. Nice.Super Mario Galaxy is far and away the prettiest game on the Wii, and a serious wake up call for most other developers making games for this system. It's bursting at the seams with life and colour, with the many bosses and mini-bosses in particular a real visual highlight. Ranging from a planetoid dwarfing mech to a giant purple-furred mole with a spiked turtle shell helmet that ploughs through the earth in his pursuit of you, EAD Tokyo has outdone itself. Bowser has never looked better either; imposing and weighty, his crop of rich red hair waving as he moves. He looks so good, in fact, that we'll forgive Nintendo for rinsing and repeating your encounters with him.Mario, also, has never looked better, and the game worlds are littered with visual touches both small and large, from the excellent enemy animations through to epic settings, such as a world where Mario is navigating a series of moving platforms that are arrayed around a spiralling mass of water being sucked into a black hole. It's simply stunning.The way the visuals are utilised is a huge part of the game's visual appeal too. The way Mario flies in to each level, and the frequent soaring boosts between areas are just a great way to show off the game's visual style. Whether you're being shot from the bottom of the sea, up and out across a gorgeous tropical vista, or you're rocketing just above the lava covered surface of a planet, jets of red hot magma arcing back and forth above you, it's a real showcase for the system and for the visual design. Not only that, it's also a clear statement by Nintendo. The frequent, breathtaking flights are reflective of the freedom in the game, of the way the company has cast off the shackles of the platform genre to offer something new and exhilarating.The soundtrack is pretty damn good too, running from classic remixes and old school melodies through to more orchestral arrangements. A couple of scores are less interesting than others - one in particular sounded like it had been pulled straight from an awards show, its strings and flutes sitting somewhere between 'sweeping' and 'muzak'. Still, it's clear that the team has had fun with the soundtrack. One section sees Mario running atop a ball (think Super Mario Ball), and the faster he moves, the faster the music plays.If we absolutely had to find faults with this game, we'd say that (as mentioned earlier) the camera isn't as seamless when swimming and flying as it is when on or above land. It's a small quibble though, and when you consider that you're often swimming around small globes of water, understandable. We'd also say that while the game generally does a good job educating the player (whether through instruction, or more subtle game design, such as putting a butt stompable stone near an enemy that can only be knocked out of its hidey hole with a butt stomp), we don't remember seeing any explanation of many of Mario's core abilities like triple jumps, backflips and long jumps. For anyone who has played a 3D Mario game before that's fine, but newcomers may need to consult the manual. See? Pretty damn hard to find flaws.Rapturous. There is simply no better word to describe this game. Its a joy to play from start to finish; jam-packed full of both inventive new ideas and nods to Mario past, with a difficulty curve that climbs slowly and steadily. Rest assured  you wont have any trouble beating Bowser, but finding all 120 stars will be a challenge for even the most hardened gamers. Not only is this the best game on Wii, its also the best platformer ever made.", "date": "Nov 27, 2007"}
