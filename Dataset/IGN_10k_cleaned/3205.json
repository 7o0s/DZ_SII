{"name": "Treasure Planet", "name_review": "Treasure Planet", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/15/treasure-planet", "text": "is the next animated film set to be released by Disney, so along with the movie comes its accompanying set of games. Magenta Software has worked on the PSOne version of Treasure Planet for Disney Interactive, and the game seems to stick close to the movie's plot points and adventurous nature. The game is a platformer through and through, but it also throws in some Solar Surfing, which is pretty much sail boarding but solar style, to mix up the action a bit.   The game pits players as Jim Hawkins on his quest to find Treasure Planet and in search of riches. Accompanying Jim is Dr. Doppler, his scientist buddy who gives hints at the start of each level, and Morph, a small, shape changing, floating pink blob.   Gameplay  Control-wise, Treasure Planet plays much like every other platformer in existence. Along with the standard run, jump and double-jump for generally moving around the world, Jim has a sword and a musket with which to dispatch enemies and open crates or barrels. Morph is also able to change into a glider by pressing Triangle, which allows Jim to cross large gaps and make long jumps.   Jim controls well enough as he moves around, but there are some level interaction problems that can make the game a bit frustrating, especially in regards to ledges. Jim will sometimes be able to grab onto the edge of a platform that he wasn't quite able to jump to the top of. The problem is that some ledges will let you hang from the edge, and some won't. When making a long jump for the first time, you'll just have to hope that your landing spot will let you snag its edge in case you don't quite make it, otherwise there may be a long fall and a journey back up to your jump point to try again. Edges also present a problem when you need to move near them or navigate tight walkways. Some edges aren't solid in the manner that you'd expect them to be, and you may slide off the edge of a walkway when you don't expect it. Walking planks and whatnot can be a little unforgiving, and the only way to circumvent this is to walk very slow and carefully.   The game is broken up into a few different worlds and areas. They include Montressor, the Cresentia Spaceport, the RLS Legacy, and Treasure Planet itself. Each area has up to three different sections, including the basic level, a race, and possibly a boss to fight. In order to move on to later areas, you'll need to collect Treasure Planet Tokens. There are a few to be collected in each section, and each new area requires a certain amount of tokens before you can travel there. Most tokens are earned from one of a few ways. There are some characters that will have you complete a task, most of which involve an easy shooting or collection game of some sort. You can buy tokens from souvenir machines, earn one by collecting scrolls, or win a few by putting up good lap times in the race levels.   Along with collecting the necessary Treasure Planet Tokens, you're able to collect Gallery Tokens. These will unlock items in the Gallery option from the Main Menu, including movies, character images, and backgrounds. There are 12 items in each section of the gallery, for a total of 36 items to unlock. The confusing part about this is the fact that you don't need to collect every Gallery Token to open everything in the gallery. I was still missing a handful of Gallery Tokens at one point during my run through the game, and yet everything in all three galleries was unlocked for my viewing pleasure.   The levels are all very similar in the way they work, which while they all look different, makes it feel like you're completing the same tasks to move through the levels over and over. There are spots where you'll be able to charge your pistol and fire it from a reasonable distance, which is normally used to shoot crates and barrels up on ledges that you can't reach. There are many of these spots, but none are really hidden, so charging the pistol and then firing at a far off position just becomes an overly easy task, if not a tedious one. Every level also has doors that must be opened by finding Diodes and placing them in a certain door to power it. The Diodes are all simple to find, and are usually just placed on an easy to reach ledge, so collecting them and progressing through the level just requires randomly running around until you spot it. There isn't really any skill or puzzle solving required to navigate the levels. The only semi-hidden things in the levels are breakable walls, which are noticeable by the large cracks that run through them. Blasting them with your musket will open them, and there'll be something secret to collect, like a Gallery Token or scroll.    The act of finding Diodes and placing them in doors is practically the only requirement to make it to the end of each level, and as these tasks are overly simplistic, the game becomes extraordinarily boring. The only semi-difficult parts of the levels are trying to make some of the more unforgiving jumps, and those are more irritating than hard. Aside from the two boss fights, the enemies you face are almost all exactly the same. There are a few different characters, but they only attack in a total of three or four different ways.   The two boss fights are decent and have a bit of originality in the way you fight them, but they aren't as exciting as I think had been hoped. For example, the first fight is against a spider-like creature. The two of you are separated by a gap, so you can't just run over and attack him. He tosses some barrels at you, and occasionally a grenade. You must dodge barrels, pick up the grenades, and toss them back at him. After a few hits, he'll jump up on a moving crate, and attempt to use a flamethrower on you. Now you'll have to dodge the fire, while still tossing any grenades at him that come your way. The fights are cool in that they're a little unconventional and much different than fighting anything else in the game, but they're largely based around dodging stuff for a while, and waiting for an opening. The stuff you need to dodge is pretty simple, so the fights get to be a little slow and consequently a bit boring.   The race levels have you complete six laps with either your Solar Surfer or the RLS Legacy. You'll start with limited time, but there are clocks scattered throughout the track, and picking these up on each lap will add some time. There are also coins, gems, Gallery Tokens, and other things to collect as you round the track. You'll receive a Treasure Planet Token for your race time, with up to three tokens awarded if you beat the best time. The best times are pretty tight, so you'll have to race well in order to beat it. While messing up will slow you down enough that you'll miss the best time, and jumping can sometimes be unforgiving and may destroy your lap time if you fall in a pit, the races are slow and fairly easy. Once you've gone around the track a few times, you'll learn where everything you need to avoid is located, and the race becomes a snoozer.   One nice idea that severely lacks in execution is the use of actual scenes from the movie to push the storyline. It's awesome to see real scenes from the movie play out between each level, but the clips are reasonably short, and they don't have any sort of introduction to them. What ends up happening is that you'll see scenes from the movie, and sort of figure out what's happening, but how or why anything is going on is pretty much a mystery. There isn't any sort of storyline development during the play of the levels, so leaving the short clips to themselves to explain the story doesn't work. Of course, the game is being catered to people who will probably have seen the movie by the time they pick up the game, and they'll likely know what's going on, but for those that haven't seen the movie, it's just confusing.    Graphics  Even considering that Treasure Planet is running on last-generation hardware, it still looks bad. For starters, there's constant texture warping everywhere. It's bad enough that the levels look alive and breathing as you walk around, except that this isn't a survival-horror game. The warping doesn't stop with the textures, either. Some of the geometry will physically skew from time to time, and it's most common when there are two boxes stacked up. Unfortunately, there are boxes everywhere, so you'll see this quite a bit.   There are also many occasions where the game doesn't occlude objects properly, so something that is actually behind another object may be drawn in front of it instead of behind it. Objects randomly pop in and out of view from behind wall and boxes. The texture warping and depth problems are a common occurrence in many PSOne games, but this game has these problems much worse than most games, and it's hard to find a spot where something isn't being drawn incorrectly in some way.   Aside from these drawing problems, the game also suffers in the art department. Jim's running animation is laughably bad. The rest of his animations are pretty limited, and what animations he does have are pretty basic. Everything else in the game fares worse. The enemies walk around in a crippled manner, and they look pretty terrible to boot. Texture work is pretty terrible throughout the game. Everything has a pretty low color palette, so there's constant color banding pretty much everywhere, especially on the characters.     Sound  Treasure Planet's sound ranges from decent to bad. Some of the effects match the game's style decently, but there's not a whole lot to them. The bulk of the sound that stands out is the character voices. Some of the character voices are great. David Hyde-Pierce voices Dr. Doppler, and he's great, and even a tad funny at some points. A couple of the unimportant NPC characters that give you tasks have great voices, though you'll really only talk to them once, and they don't have much to say.   On the other end of the spectrum is Jim's voice work. He's voiced by Third Rock from the Sun's Joseph Gordon-Levitt. While some of the stuff he says is done well, other things sound out of place and forced. Jim's voice work is also very limited in that he only has one response for each action, and since he says some sort of remark after finding or accomplishing anything, things can get very repetitive. Reaching a checkpoint, finding a secret, grabbing a Treasure Planet Token, or doing any other number of things will evoke a response from Jim, but he says the same thing every time. After hearing him say ~Yeah! Checkpoint!~ for the thousandth time, you'll start searching for the mute button on your remote.   The one highlight in the game for me is the music. Most of it sounds something like an Irish folk tune, and it repeats quite quickly, but I found it to be pretty catchy in an odd and possibly scary way. It fits sort of along the same lines as the theme from It's a Small World at Disneyland in that it'll just drill into your head, but it's not as grating to the ears.  Treasure Planet is a complete bore of a game. It's supposed to be targeted at children, but I can't help but feel sorry for them. Back in the day when I was a tyke, we had to play games like Pitfall, Defender, and Super Mario Bros. None of these games force fed you easy goals until you completed the game, and yet they were extraordinarily fun. These days, games catered to kids seem to all be targeted towards rewarding you for even the most menial task, as opposed to requiring any minutia of skill.Even regardless of how easy this game is, it's still extraordinarily boring and it looks terrible. There's hardly anything in the game that changes after the first level, so it just seems entirely repetitive. Still, the music was cool, though I might be locked up for thinking that.", "date": "Nov 15, 2002"}
