Like many gamers, I'm a little weary of the glut of wargames and simulations set in the European Theater of World War II, so when CDV announced they'd be publishing a strategy game based on the Pacific side of the conflict, I was understandably excited. When I learned that it combined operational strategy with real-time tactical battles and an additional action element, I was sold.  Having played through the game for the past week, I've been really impressed with the overall scale presented here. The naval war between Imperial Japan and the United States is one of the largest and, in my opinion, most dramatic in history, so it's no small task to recreate the entire thing in as much detail as you'll find here. There are two campaigns, one where the setups are based on history and one where the forces are relatively equal at the start. A series of standalone tactical battles and a battle generator offer a chance for players to try out individual actions.   One of the most appealing aspects of the game is its ability to recreate the general rhythm and flavor of the War without necessarily sticking too closely to historical events. The Japanese won't always attack at Pearl Harbor, for instance, and there won't always be a showdown at Midway or Leyte Gulf. Some games may see a massive all-out battle in the waters around Bouganville or may see the Japanese attempt to shift the focus of the war from the south to the north. Each new decision takes the game off into entirely new directions.  There are three levels of play here. At the highest level, you'll be in charge of the creation and movement of fleets, men and material, as well as the production and research goals of your country's war efforts. You'll capture and build bases, manage a vast number of resources and raw materials, create formations, upgrade obsolete units, and a whole range of other essential activities.  When your forces meet those of the enemy, you'll have the option to take control of the battle in a traditional real-time strategy format. The entire fight takes place on a full 3D map that represents the location you're fighting over, from the Panama Canal to Saigon. A wide range of orders lets you set the general tone of the battle without having to manage every single unit's actions.   Finally, there's an action mode that allows you to jump into and out of direct control of any friendly aircraft in the tactical battles. Once in the cockpit, you'll have full control of the craft and can dogfight with enemy fighters, intercept enemy bombers or launch your own bombs and torpedoes at enemy ships. The action mode also allows you to man the AA guns on any ship in your fleet.  With so much going on, it can take a few hours (or more) to get used to the basics of the game. Luckily a series of tutorials spells out the most essential elements and gives you a bit of a head start. Still, with a game this dense, the tutorial leaves a lot unexplained and you'll have to discover the game's finer points by playing it and referring back to the comprehensive manual.   The strategic level alternates between moving fleets on a tabletop map and handling logistical concerns in a series of rather bland brown windows. While it's certainly not any drier than the similar windows found in Uncommon Valor or other logistical games, some gamers may find themselves yawning at the spreadsheets that confront them at every level of the strategic game. Boring though they may be, they're absolutely essential to winning the war.       Your war effort is funded by the accumulation of iron, aluminum and oil from your bases throughout the Pacific. Money and men are also required to commission and man the navies, air groups, marines and engineer brigades you'll need to defend your current territories and, hopefully, extend your power. The resources are all ferried back to the abstract ~homeland~ area where you research a wide range of new technologies and order the production of everything, from battleships to torpedoes. Thankfully, most of the movement of raw materials is handled for you, freeing you up for more important work.  There's a nice range of options here, which can drastically alter the shape of the war. What if the US spent the time and money invested in the Manhattan Project to fund development of jet engines? What if Japan obtained cruise missile technology early and was able to use it to hold off Allied landings? All these outcomes and more are possible with the game's sizeable tech tree and the way you put new technologies into production is going to have an immediate impact on your ability to defeat your enemy.   As new units are built, they'll be delivered to your country's main port where they'll be staffed, fueled, and rolled into larger formations. The lone ship has no place in this war, so you'll want to create large fleets that can act independently. The game gives you a list of several different types of groupings and with a single click you can even order construction of all the units required to create, say, a fast strike carrier fleet or a transport division.  You'll need a wide range of bases, not only to provide a steady income, but also to serve as refueling, repairing and rearming spots for fleets and air groups. Each base can be upgraded with a wide range of buildings, from churches that improve morale to shooting ranges that improve effectiveness to ports that improve the loading and unloading of ammo, fuel and other supplies. There are so many types of supplies here that you'll likely want to hand over control of its movement to the AI. A battleship for instance, requires several different ammunition types and you don't want to go into battle with your deck guns loaded and no rounds for your 20mm AA guns.  The tactical battles play out like a traditional RTS game. The attacking units will have staging areas where they can enter the battle, while the defending units will often benefit from the protection of land-based defenses. The tactical maps are very easy to read. A handy top-down mini-map shows all known combatants and a series of red and green icons shows off the units in the main game window. A sidebar on the left gives you complete and ready access to all of your units. I'd love to have seen a little more a breakdown here, like a large grouping of all units of one type, but the icons are easy enough to read that you can grab them all yourself. Further enhancing the readability of the map, a system of green and red lines show you where your selected units are moving and which targets they're firing on. This feature can make things very clear during an otherwise chaotic battle.   The best part of the tactical battle interface though is the order panel. Here you can set general orders for all or part of your fleet. With a single click, you can order your units to hold position and fire on the enemy, to maintain a certain engagement distance or even set the priorities of their attack. This can be very useful if you'd like your torpedo bombers to bypass destroyers and cruisers and concentrate their fire on the massive battleships. Separate controls for launching planes, setting their altitude, setting the depth of subs, all give you a very fine level of control over the fight.      The action mode lets you take direct control of any friendly plane in a fight or of any friendly deck gun. The flight models aren't on par with the realism you'd find in something like Pacific Fighters, but it's a step up from the arcade style model in games like Secret Weapons Over Normandy. In other words, it's enough to give yoke and stick fans a thrill but not so much that flight sim novices are going to have trouble staying in the air.  While it first seemed like little more than an admittedly exciting novelty to be able to take charge of planes and make torpedo runs on enemy ships, I've found that taking charge of the planes can actually have a serious impact on the battle. Since you can jump back and forth from plane to plane at will, you can usually score a few direct hits on any target you can get to.   Controlling the AA guns on the other hand is just boring. I understand that some gamers might enjoy sitting on the deck and firing at planes that fly past, but it just doesn't seem to carry the same excitement or purpose that you get from the cockpit of a Ki-84 or a TBD.  But as interesting and unique as Pacific Storm is, there are still some considerable problems to be found at every level. To begin with, the game's tactical mode suffers from a variety of seemingly unavoidable crashes to the desktop. Losing a plane under direct control or exiting to the strategic view before the battle is completed seem to be the culprits here, but there may be other causes.   You'll also encounter some odd AI decisions. The AI will sometimes retreat from a battle when there's no real reason to pull out. Sometimes after surrendering direct control of a plane, the AI will decide to crash the plane (and others nearby) into the ground. You can lose entire squadrons like this. Given the massive amounts of logistical decisions to make here, you'll have to hand over many of those decisions to the AI. While they're generally pretty sound, you'll often find that the AI is spending time sending supplies to bases that are far from danger.   There are some features that ought to have been included but weren't. The game seems poised to offer full command of the various ships and their deck guns but simulation mode only allows you to man the anti-air guns. It definitely seems like something's missing from the experience. Some of the features that are in place seem incomplete as well. Cruise missiles are useless on the strategic map and their tactical usefulness doesn't justify the expense incurred in obtaining them.  While the interface manages to convey a lot of useful information, there are some obvious rough patches. Trying to get large fleets organized is helped by the addition of a number of pre-set configurations but commanders who want to form their fleets a la carte are going to have a hell of a time wrestling with the formation panel. A drag-and-drop system would have made things much easier for players who like to shuffle their forces around. Likewise, the formation information windows don't organize the individual divisions within each formation. The orders of battle are just too hard to read when like units aren't grouped together.  Given the amount of data in the game, it's no wonder that there are some small informational errors. It's easy to forgive minor inaccuracies in ship names and starting locations, of course, but it's downright confusing to be given a government mission for a task you've already achieved. Likewise, the game counts a successful aerial attack as a ~crushing defeat~ simply because your forces didn't occupy any enemy territory at the end of the attack.      The graphics also seem to run pretty poorly, even with the options set on the lower levels. The chugginess of the graphics is really apparent when you've got lots of units involved in a battle, but even the smaller actions are too choppy given the quality of the graphics.  That's not to say that the graphics are bad. For the scale of the game and for the amount of things it represents, the graphics are fairly impressive. Loads of individual ship and plane models, plenty of buildings and a 3D model of the entire Pacific are more than enough work for any team of artists and the gang behind Pacific Storm has managed to add plenty of character and substance to each object in the game.   Each ship and plane comes with great little animations, from rotating turrets and fire control towers to opening bomb bays and working rudders. Seeing the parts of the ships and planes move around adds a lot of life to the game. Throw in skies full of flak bursts and tracer fire, seas broken by waves and geysers and the requisite smoke and fire from damaged ships and you've got a game that really captures the chaos of battle.  While it's not flashy, I like the tabletop representation of the strategic level. (Although the weather patterns ruins the effect of playing with counters on a map.) It takes a while to read the icons over the bases and fleets, but you'll soon start to see, at a glance, which units have low morale, which ones are steaming to attack and which ones are operating under a named commander.   The sound in Pacific Storm is fairly generic. The battle sounds definitely add a little excitement to the experience, but they're far too thin to be totally convincing. Fire from the deck guns of the USS Washington should shake the room. The same can be said of the music. While the game's score is made up of some nice military themes, the quality of the sound itself doesn't really give you the full effect that it should.Pacific Storm is an entirely original experience. Though there are a number of good games that simulate either the operational or tactical aspects of the war, none have combined the two into the complete experience you get with Pacific Storm. At one moment you'll be directing the production and movement of fleets, the next you'll be jumping into the cockpit of a lone torpedo bomber as it skims towards a massive enemy battleship.While it's a dream come true for grognards like me, the game is just too dense to have much appeal beyond the audience of dedicated wargamers. The logistical concerns are probably the most intimidating and alienating aspect of the game but these can safely be turned over to the AI. Those gamers who are willing to dig deep will definitely find that the game rewards their efforts, provided that the crashes in tactical mode are ironed out with a quick patch.", "date": "Oct 11, 2006"}
