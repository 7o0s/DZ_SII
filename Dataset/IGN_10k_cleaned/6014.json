After finishing the final copy of the game, we're happy to report improved framerates, polished cinematics, crisper sound effects, and superbly voiced characters. Underlying some of the game's polish, however, is a flawed combo system, repetitive level design, stale storyline, and a jarringly short play length that should ward off casual action fans and attract only those who consider themselves fans of the Evil Dead series.   The basic storyline follows Ash and his half-Deadite partner Sam across ten levels as he tries to stop the mad Dr. Reinhard from using the Necronomicon to unleash an unstoppable army of Deadites across the Earth. In the process, Ash will have to rescue Sally Bowline, the game's damsel in distress, who is notable because she possesses Dr. Knowby's diary, a key component in Dr. Reinhard's experiments, and a significant amount of cleavage.   The Many Ways to Kill the Dead   From the game's beginning in Dr. Knowby's cabin and Sunny Meadows Asylum you'll make your way through mines, a shipyard, a swamp, and eventually an alternate dimension on your quest to shoot Dr. Reinhard in the face. To make it there, you're going to have to fight a whole hell of a lot of skeletons and Deadites, and there are plenty of combat options for you to use. Ash can combo enemies with his chainsaw and shotgun, kick Sam at shambling foes to pop their heads off, and perform special finishing moves once a Deadite has taken enough damage and starts emitting a green vapor.   Through the first few levels, combining the various combat maneuvers was a lot of fun, especially to see the finishing move animations which are simultaneously violent and hilarious. It's when you start to open up the game's more advanced weapons that problems crop up.   Killing fatty, gassy demons. Specifically, the higher level weapons, the bomb-lance and flamethrower in particular, are way overpowered and completely undercut the game's combo system and Evil Ash aspects. This wouldn't be a problem if they weren't necessary to use, but they are. If you try and unleash your chainsaw and shotgun combos later on in the game, even with the souped up chainsaw you eventually get, you'll wind up getting slaughtered.   The later levels turn into a repetitive process of locking onto your enemies and circle strafing around them while blasting your bomb lance until you can use a finishing move. In crowds, it just doesn't make sense to use anything but the flamethrower, which demolishes enemies in about five seconds. The harpoon gun seemed particularly unfair as well, since it pulls enemies directly to the mouth of your shotgun, allowing you to decimate them with only two pushes of a button. An advanced enemy A.I. may have resolved this issue, forcing players to react more dynamically, but your foes prove to be pretty stupid. Then again, they're dead, so what can you really expect?     Thankfully, you'll have an easy time controlling your overpowered arsenal since the game's camera and targeting system generally function as they should. After you target an enemy you're free to switch between foes and use your guns or Sam on whoever is in your sights. This works flawlessly at long distances, but in close quarters it begins to stumble, either forcing you to rotate through your targets in the opposite direction to reach your intended target or forcing Ash to face the wrong direction.   Targeting where trying to kick Sam becomes the most serious control issue. It's only a big deal because some enemies and bosses require you to use Sam as a distraction while you shoot them. The problem is when you initially engage the targeting, it seems to target a random enemy, not necessarily who you're facing. When you're facing a limited window of opportunity to give Sam the boot, this winds up making things unnecessarily complicated. You'll wind up getting even more frustrated because Sam will autonomously fight enemies and therefore not always be available to punt.   The camera is less of a problem, allowing you to see all the necessary action and landscape of the game. It can be swung around to any angle and also automatically centered behind Ash, though in close quarters it seemed to get stuck or swing around too far.   For as short an experience as Evil Dead: Regeneration is, its puzzle elements become surprisingly repetitive. While it's fun through the first few levels, finding spirits to feed to the soul eater to access a boss becomes a tired formula after a few cycles. Accessing each spirit usually requires the player to directly take control of Sam, which can be fun. Sam has a stun bolt and the ability to punch and decapitate enemies, but mainly you'll rush through his sequences to get back to controlling Ash's arsenal.   The puzzle elements in the Sam stages, like the soul eater, become repetitive as well. Players will find themselves completing a ~ride the giant Deadite~ sequence almost every level and undergoing a superfluous amount of hand-over-hand sequences. Thankfully, every Sam sequence concludes with him getting horrifically killed in some inventive new fashion, whether being ground up by cogs, crushed by boulders and cranes, or splattered by exploding propane tanks.   Almost pretty. Ash has a few puzzles to solve himself by using his various armaments, which do manage to get interesting in the last levels when he has to use various weapons skills in combination. The boss fights are generally a pedestrian affair with the occasional twist.   The Dead Have Never Looked Good   The game features a decent amount of cutscenes for such a short length. The cutscene visuals are dressed up with a cartoony flair, giving all characters and enemies much more expression and range of animation. Characters' mouthed their lines with an adequate though not outstanding degree of accuracy. Real-time graphics are a step down in quality, but still animate smoothly outside of encounters with large groups of enemies. On Xbox everything is sharper and animates with more fluidity.     The swamp, shipyard, and temple levels stand out as the most visually attractive, sporting complex architectures, sun flares, and interesting level content. Some of the levels though, like the catacombs and the cemetery can only be described as boring, while a level like Port Turnham can only be described as ugly.   Of particular graphical interest are the finishing move scenes, which occasionally cut away to a close up slow motion execution animation. Thankfully, monsters do not attack you while waiting for the animation to finish, so you can relax as you watch Ash chop his enemies in two while caving in their skulls with buckshot. The bomb-lance is also a lot of fun to watch since it plants a large rocket in an enemies chest before detonating and sending them flipping end over end across the screen.   Needless to say, there's a lot of blood in this game, but nothing too visceral, mostly of a cartoonish nature.   Even the Dead Scream When You Shoot Them in the Face   While most of the sounds are mediocre, though Ash's chainsaw sounds appropriately menacing, one part of the game that absolutely cannot be criticized is the voice acting. Quite frankly, it's great. Bruce Campbell voices Ash and Ted Raimi (Sam's brother) voices Sam (an inside joke?) and they do not shut up the whole game. They have a comment for almost every different area of a level. The best part is that it's always funny and rarely repetitive.   This guy might want a bandage. Instead of a character tapping their foot or checking their watch if you let them stand still for a while, Ash and Sam launch into vehement arguments, which are usually resolved by Ash telling Sam to shut up. For instance, Sam will randomly say, ~If you could be any kind of squash, what would you be?~ to which Ash will respond, ~Hey, how do I say shut the hell up in dead midget?~ If you didn't find that funny then you didn't read this far.   For the dedicated fans there are 20 unlockable items hidden throughout the game, though they're not hidden very well. Upon finding them, players unlock game art and clips of Bruce and Ted talking about producing the game and other Evil Dead and Sam Raimi related topics. For many, that's worth the price of admission alone.  This game is short and easy, has a few hidden extras, decent graphics, a great sense of humor, and excellent voice acting. If you're a fan of both action games and Evil Dead, it's worth shelling out the 20 bucks for this, even if it's just to put it on your shelf as yet another collectible. Nothing about this game feels intricate or deep aside from the combo system which is eventually trumped by your superpowered arsenal. If you're just an everyday day action fan looking for a new fix, it's probably not here. There's no way this game takes longer than eight hours to beat, and after one run through there's no reason a casual fan will ever return. For as short as it is, though, I laughed and had a good time.", "date": "Sep 13, 2005"}
