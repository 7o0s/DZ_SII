And, well, perhaps you don't. It was a blip in the arcades, but that hasn't stopped SEGA from porting it to handsets, where the forgotten classic may find new life.  Features:  Classic arcade game Multiple mazes Saved high scores  You know, not every game from the 80s is a classic. Some are forgotten for a reason -- and sadly, Fast Lane may be one of them. The simplistic game play may actually be too simple, if that's at all possible.  You control a little red car, trapped in a maze of walls and dots. Your mortal enemy? A maniacal yellow hot rod that is hell bent on matching your every move in an effort to cause a head-on collision.  The only way to avoid a higher insurance premium is by keeping one step ahead (or behind) by changing speed. Speed up to make it to the interchange just before the yellow car can, or slow down to let it breeze by.  The goal of the car is to collect all of the dots in each maze by running over them. It's very Pac-Man, but without ghosts. And fun. (There's a reason Reverend Jim made a reference to Pac-Man in ~Taxi,~ instead of Fast Lane.)  The visuals are so simple that the lack of audio is a bizarro oversight. Or a sign of laziness. Who knows? The screen is almost entirely blue, like most streets. The only splashes of color come from the red and yellow cars, save for the occasional explosion when you try to occupy the same space at the same time.~Classic~ is such a subjective word when it comes to video games. It can refers to the time period or the quality of the game -- sometimes both. With Fast Lane, it's strictly a time measurement. Because if you were measuring the entertainment value with a yardstick, well, it wouldn't be any longer than an ant's weenie.Which is short.", "date": "Feb 13, 2004"}
