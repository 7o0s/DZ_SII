Memorick is the kind of game I hate to review, because as much as I like it, the game is so far below the quality demanded on Xbox that it's impossible to give Memorick a high score. This is a game that will please those looking for a few hours of nostalgic gaming, but anyone else will likely be disappointed. The graphics, sound, and gameplay are perfect for a game from five or six years ago -- but it's not five years ago, is it?  Taking place in the world of Arthurian legend, your adventures as Merlin's apprentice (don't ask how that makes you a ~knight's apprentice,~ I have no idea) will bring you into contact with the likes of Arthur's evil half-sister, Morgana, and the Lady of the Lake. While Memorick draws on Arthurian influences, it's not very particular on recreating any specific aspects of Avalon, choosing to more or less offer some casual associations.  Memorick is a pure adventure game, something that is hard to find on Xbox, but it plays like an old PC classic instead of a current-gen title. In fact, if someone were to tell me Memorick was a cool little sleeper hit on the PC last decade, I'd totally believe it. Sadly, its time has passed and just about everything about Memorick feels dated.   The visuals are weak by Xbox standards, with minimal effects and limited animations, but things are given a boost by the very cool, cartoonish designs for the main characters. If only the environments shared the same flare, as they are pretty much generic. Oh, here is the fire level. Ah, and this is the ~desert~ level.     Controls are very basic. You have a sword and shield and though you learn a few new moves as the game progresses, most of your time will be spent tapping X to repeatedly swing your sword. There's nothing dynamic to the animations, though, so instead of stringing together combos and making combat interesting, you simply swipe back and forth like a bland man swinging a cane. Enemies are plentiful, but have very basic and easy-to-predict attack patterns. Combat, quite simply, is Memorick's biggest downfall. The tricky camera can get stuck or obstructed by objects, leading to death (don't worry, you respawn nearby) more often than it should. If the combat were at least compentent, Memorick would be a recommendable game, for certain.  I found myself enjoying parts of Memorick despite these problems. Yes, it's simplistic and has some very easy quests to accomplish, but the platforming brought me back to the days of yore when leaping from platforms was tricky and frustrating, but ultimately addicting in some strange way. There's a lot of platforming in Memorick, a lot, and it's all hindered by the fact that our young hero with the terribly un-heroic name doesn't have a more solid shadow to show his position when in the air. It's very tough to judge where you will land, making it tough to hit moving platforms, which becomes very aggravating.  What I like about Memorick are the flashes of old-school goodness. Like when you have to waterslide through a treacherous cavern to reach the Lady of the Lake. Speeding down the water, you have to steer quickly to avoid obstacles and smoldering geysers. It's fun. As is racing your horse through the bramble. Simple, uncomplicated, but enjoyable for what it is. The boss battles are also decent, with each boss requiring the use of pattern recognition or some sort of trick to defeat -- just like in the old days.  The story has some prominence in Memorick, as is customary for an adventure game. But none of it is terribly compelling. The voices are mostly good, with a few very amateurish voices (~paging Morgana, will the voice of Morgana please respond~) and a very repetitive score.  Knight's Apprentice: Memorick's Adventures fails to offer anything more advanced than what you'd find in the early-goings of the N64. Still, I had some fun with it, despite the short length (even bad gamers will be able to finish this in under 10 hours). I think the main reason I like Memorick is that it's a throwback to an older era, but it also illustrates just how far games have come. Even for kids, this game just doesn't get the job done. I'd rather have this come out for $40 and be good than come out for $20 and only manage to be mediocre.", "date": "Jun 16, 2004"}
