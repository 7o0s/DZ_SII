{"name": "The Incredible Machine", "name_review": "The Incredible Machine Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/09/24/the-incredible-machine-review", "text": "The Incredible Machine was a pitch-perfect puzzler on the PC scene over a decade ago -- and now Vivendi has reassembled the game for a platform that's a seemingly excellent match: Mobile. Players must assembles machines from over sixty different parts, such as laser beams and oscillating fans, to accomplish innocent goals, such as turning on a light switch or dropping some toast.   It plays like a hybrid of the breakfast sequence from ~Pee Wee's Big Adventure~ and the trap-setting elements of the PC game Evil Genius. Starting small, players learn the basics of pulling parts from a catalog and positioning them on-screen before activating the machine. Getting it right the first time loads you up with bonus points, but you do have as many shots at assembling the required machine as needed. There is no harsh punishment here, a smart design choice for a game that focuses on the art of creation, but there are rewards for good performance, such as unlocking new themes and backdrops.   There are 80 puzzles in the game, making it a solid value. I cannot attest to the replay value of the game, so perhaps you might consider a subscription instead of an outright buy. However long you do keep the game on your phone, I know you will come back to it again and again until you do finish the 80 puzzles. The easy interface, great colors, and fun animations fuel the addictiveness of the game. It's just a fun game to mess around with, whether for five minutes or an hour.I really enjoyed The Incredible Machine on the PC and found it to be a solid fit for mobile. There is a certain satisfaction you get from the act of creation that just doesn't come from shooting bad guys or winning a race. If you're looking for a different sort of puzzle game from the match-three clones or block-droppers, tinker with The Incredible Machine for a while -- it's a gasser.", "date": "Sep 24, 2007"}
