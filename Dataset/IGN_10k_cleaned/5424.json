{"name": "Hearts of Iron 2", "name_review": "Hearts of Iron 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/01/07/hearts-of-iron-2", "text": "For five years now, Paradox Interactive has carved out an impressive niche in the real-time strategy genre. Starting with Europa Universalis the developers have created a series of games that are rich in historical detail and strategic depth. It's an acquired taste, to be sure, but one that we've come to appreciate. Since most of the titles have focused on pre-Industrial settings, their take on the Second World War in the original Hearts of Iron definitely brought a new level of excitement to the series.  Gamers who picked up Hearts of Iron were able to experience Paradox's unique strategy model in an hour-by-hour simulation of World War 2. Running in real time from 1936 through the end of 1947, Hearts of Iron put you at the helm of any one of a variety of nations and tasked you with shaping the diplomatic, economic, military, and scientific goals both before and during the War. The sequel is much like the original game except that it's a hell of a lot better. There are many more territories to fight over here, a more streamlined management concept, and, perhaps most importantly, far fewer bugs.  Let it be said right at the start: this is a hard game with a sometimes-unfriendly level of depth. If you're expecting a remake of Axis and Allies you're going to be disappointed. In Hearts of Iron 2 you're responsible for absolutely everything short of leading the troops on the battlefield. Trading for resources, allocating production, keeping the home front happy, assigning research priorities, negotiating alliances with other nations, replacing cabinet members and a host of other responsibilities all fall on your desk and that's not even considering any of your numerous military tasks.  Some gamers will be scared off by the scope of the game. For others (me, for instance) it's the game's most appealing characteristic. You can cut your teeth on the 15 or so smaller scenarios that offer a more limited scope. You can try to repulse the German's push through the Ardennes in late 1944 or throw back the Russian invasion during the Russo-Finnish War. Other operations include Barbarossa, The Coral Sea, the Spanish Civil War, North Africa, and a few for the German Blitz into Eastern Europe and France and the Allied invasions of Italy, Normandy and Japan. While these scenarios teach the basics of combat, the production, research and diplomacy options are limited or entirely absent.  When you launch into the grand campaign, you have the option of starting at a variety of times as the head of a variety of nations. (You can also switch nations when you load old games.) You can run through the whole thing starting in 1936 if you really want, or opt to begin in 1939, 1941 or 1944. The historical set-up for each starting year is accurate but you can expect the game to diverge from there. You'll still have many of the same events at about the same time but the small variations will start to add up after a while to give each game a different flavor. Sure, you'll still see a Spanish Civil War and many of the historical annexations and declarations of war but the timing and character of each will be colored by thousands of other factors that differ from game to game.  One of the most significant and welcome changes is that armies now attack on the move. In the previous Paradox games, armies had to travel into the enemy's territory before they engaged in combat. Units in Hearts of Iron 2 now fight across the borders. Not only does this make the attacks much clearer, but it also means that repulsed attackers still occupy their original territory without needing to retreat.   This new system also allows for supported attacks and reserve units. Units stationed in territories that border on an attacked territory can lend their support to that attack without being displaced. This helps to keep your fronts a lot more solid. Adjacent units can also lend their support to the defense of nearby territories. Units can also be put on ~reserve~ status and will be used to fill loses incurred in any surrounding territories.  Being able to use units like this without making them move has a number of advantages. First off, it's a hell of a lot easier to manage your armies because they're not moving all over the region every time you attack. You can set timetables for attacks as well, so that supports and reserves arrive just in time for the attack. Units that don't move also gain combat effectiveness through greater organization and resupply. This is managed for you, but you'll need to make sure that you give your troops enough downtime between operations.  In terms of using the timetables, it's still just better to pause the game and issue the orders to take place immediately without needing to worry about synching up the timetables. This need to pause the game again and again, particularly as your armies grow in size, makes it unwieldy for multiplayer. When the hours pass in seconds, you'll find yourself taking weeks of game time just to plan a simple attack.      Another welcome change for the series is the inclusion of broader missions for navies and air forces. Rather than selecting specific encounters, you'll instead tell your navies and air forces to perform a certain task in a certain region under a certain timetable. You can tell a certain air unit, for instance, to bomb the infrastructure of a group of territories for the next five months. This eliminates the need to continue issuing the same order again and again as was the case in the original game. You can set a loss-limit at which the mission is called off as well in case your air forces or navies start getting destroyed in the process.  Also streamlining the process somewhat is the new notion of inherent carrier planes. Each carrier has its own dedicated compliment of aircraft built in to the price. You won't have to coordinate the production and movement of each separately anymore. Convoys have also been automated. You'll still need to produce enough convoys to fill your needs (and provide them with escorts), but their missions will be assigned automatically based on the supply and movement needs of your forces. Still managing fleets is a bit more problematic than managing armies. Until you get the hang of it, you're better off playing as a power that focuses more on land battles.  In terms of combat, you won't be in charge of the fight itself but you'll need to consider carefully all of the factors that influence combat. The historical leaders in charge of each unit in your armies, navies and air forces can have a tremendous impact on their success rate. Likewise, differences in equipment and technology help to turn defeats into victory (and vice versa). As the operational-level commander, you'll also need to be aware of the time of day that the battle takes place as well as the effects that weather or terrain have. It's a massive job and one that will take at least a few sessions to get a feel for.  Production is now all confined to a single page. Each of your territories produces a certain number of raw materials that are funneled through your factories to create production potential. You can spend this potential to create all the weapons of war you know how to make. New units go to the deployment pool in preparation for being moved into the field. Setting up constant production of certain items grants you efficiency bonuses as well. But beyond creating new weapons of war, your production also needs to be spent on upgrading and restocking existing men and material. Unlike the original game, this is all managed for you. You just need to indicate how much of your industry to devote to reserves and upgrades and the game will assign them in the field for you. Anyone who played the original game knows that this is a big convenience.   Technology is now ~bought~ rather than ~produced.~ This makes keeping the home front happy a bigger concern now, as this is where you'll get the bulk of your raw cash. You can assign a variety of teams to research broad technologies that will lead to improvements in your war-making machines. One cool new factor is that the new teams are all based on historical companies and individuals. So you can have Nimitz working on new carrier tactics or assign Ford to investigate new armor engines. Each group has one or more specialties that you'll have to consider when giving them tasks. Those who excel at designing new sub hulls, for instance, won't be as adept at designing new infantry tactics.   Diplomatic overtures also cost money. You'll have a relationship value with every other nation in the world and this relationship will change based on a variety of factors too numerous even to summarize here. Suffice it to say that the game models a variety of things here, from the ideological/political similarities between the nations to their geographic location (some nations resent far-off powers tinkering with local affairs).  In addition to negotiating alliances and non-aggression pacts, you can even create new nations out of those that you've captured or guarantee the independence of nations. This is an excellent and sneaky way for democracies to declare war without risking public outcry. Simply guarantee the independence of Yugoslavia, for instance, and the second they're attacked, you can launch into a war against the invader.  There are three main factions here -- the Allies, led by Britain; the Axis, led by Germany; and the Comintern, led by the Soviet Union. These alliances are pretty much impossible to break up so a war with one member is a war with the rest.  There are specific victory conditions in the scenarios but they're somewhat vague in the campaign. If you're playing a lesser power, there's no standard of success outside of your own awareness of the historical fate of that nation during the war. This isn't a terrible oversight but it's hampered by the lack of any sort of endgame summary that tells you whether or not your situation has improved overall.  I'm also a little disappointed that the game just ends at the end of 1947. While a clear victor should have emerged by then, you may find yourself stuck in the middle of a life or death struggle just as the game stops. This is also a weakness shared by the scenarios.      Though Paradox should be commended for improving their documentation and tutorials, more work still needs to be done here. Don't get me wrong -- this is the best that Paradox has ever done in this area but, given the range of possibilities in the game, a little more direction would be very useful. The tutorial definitely shows you where the different parts of the interface are but it doesn't go beyond that to show you why or how certain areas relate to others. You can find much of this information in the game's manual but it's dense reading.   I still dislike some of the game's presentation problems. For one thing, the message windows just never seem to stop. You can toggle these on and off at will but I can't help thinking there's a clearer, more comprehensive way to present this information to players. The fact that I have to dismiss a dozen inconsequential windows and yet never once get a report that my troops are about to disband because I can't get food to them is a continuing aggravation. The message windows for successful and failed attacks seem to display country flags at random. I'd much prefer to see the victor's flag displayed. This would make making sense of those endless windows much easier.  While the quality of the graphics isn't as big an issue in this game, there's more that could be done with them to make the experience more convenient. Small arrows indicating attacks would be much more useful than seeing troops walk in place. While it's true that you can see your own attack arrows when you've selected a certain unit, an option to display all arrows, friendly or otherwise, would make things much clearer. More could be done to separate out the stacks as well. As it is now, air units and land units are stacked together, which can add another click or two to finding just the right unit at the right time. By itself it means nothing, but when you're trying to organize an attack on the scale of Barbarossa, it can add up to a lot of wasted effort.  The graphics for the game are still pretty plain. I think that the team has managed to achieve a lot given the scope of the game but the graphics aren't necessarily going to wow anyone who has seen a PC game in the last ten years. The maps are definitely easier to read than before and a variety of color overlays gives you a good sense of what's going on at a glance. The unit sprites are fairly detailed and well (but barely) animated.  On the subject of sound, there's not too much to say with regard to Hearts of Iron 2. The music score is great and fits the game's subject very well. The orchestral score supports the action but doesn't ever really dominate it. The effects are pretty standard here. Given the scale of the game, I honestly didn't expect much in the way of effects. Those that are here tend to get repetitive.   Hearts of Iron 2 is undeniably fantastic and a considerable improvement over the original game and I couldn't possibly hope to cover every aspect of the game in a single review. In fact, even after playing through the holidays, the game is still offering up new twists and surprises with each new campaign. As I said before, if it works in the real world, it's probably somewhere in this game.But that's not say that the game is for everyone. Those who have a taste for it will definitely appreciate the complexity and depth of the game, but the density of the simulation definitely limits its appeal among more mainstream gamers. The scenarios that focus on shorter, regional conflicts offer a nice way to get up to speed before launching into the world-wide campaigns but there's simply no way to get the most out of this game without just diving in and playing it.", "date": "Jan 7, 2005"}
