IGN Wireless has long been a champion of the firm's brilliant and outrageously playable tournament-style games where players compete for prizes, such as gift cards to retailers like Best Buy, Blockbuster, and Starbucks. Now Namco America and InfoSpace have released Ms. Pac-Man for Prizes, and what a wonderful way to break the silence.   Ms. Pac-Man for Prizes, naturally, is based on the Namco classic. We all know the drill. Skirt around a series of mazes, eating pellets and avoid ghosts -- lest you gobble up a power pellet, which turns the prey into predator for a limited time.   In this tourney edition of the game, you log in to a ranking service and play a game of Ms. Pac-Man for as long as humanly possible. There are two ways to play: head-to-head or progressive. Head-to-head play pits you against another player to see who gets more points. Progressive judges your score over a series of games in a tournament structure for bigger prizes.   You only get three lives and a bonus point clock in the upper left corner of the screen is always ticking down. Your goal is to survive as long as possible, as at the end of the match, you will be ranked by your score. In a head-to-head match, you'll have to wait and see if you nibbled more pellets than your opponent. In a progressive match, you just strive to do the best you can and hope the other player fail miserably.   We played Ms. Pac-Man for Prizes on a LG VX7000 all day and were floored by what a great port of Ms. Pac-Man Namco and InfoSpace have released. Everything was smooth, from control to the sharpness of the visuals. When we were gobbled, we were only to blame. And the game makes great use of the classic strategy to press the stick in the direction you want to go next just before the turn comes up. So accurate are these maze recreations that you may wonder where to put your quarter.  I love the For Prizes series of games -- Atlas Mobile's (oops -- InfoSpace Mobile) tournament system is near-ingenious. And you simply cannot beat the possibly of winning prizes for playing a game you love in the first place. Does Ms. Pac-Man for Prizes wow my eyes like, say, Gameloft's games? No, but it is addictive as hell and plays like a dream. You just cannot ask for anything more from a three-dollar download. If you have Verizon Wireless, download it today. Serious, like now. I'll be here when you get back.", "date": "Dec 9, 2004"}
