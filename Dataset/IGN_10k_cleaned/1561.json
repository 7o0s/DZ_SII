There's a DDR Deluxe pad permanently ensconced right next to my chair here, and I usually play a few games of 3rd Mix every day after work.  It scares the janitorial staff half to death.  The thing of it is, I might be inclined to enjoy Jungle Book a good deal more if it weren't for the fact that I've played DDR.  Jungle Book is, of course, directly inspired by Konami's arcade phenomenon (to couch things in somewhat polite terms), with the same follow-the-arrow gameplay built around a series of music tracks.  The difference between the two is that, despite being the earlier of the two games, Dance Dance somehow manages to aim an awful lot higher, with far better music and a longer, smoother learning curve.  Jungle Book is defeated by its extremely narrow focus.  It's The Jungle Book, and that's all.  Gameplay  The developers have, to their credit, tried to add a little more than just straight Dance Dance gameplay to Jungle Book.  The vast majority of your time will be spent tapping buttons on the beat as arrows flow down the screen, but there are a few elements in the single-player game that seem to be drawn from Bust-a-Move and other breeds of dancing game.  Every so often you'll be offered the opportunity to grab a power-up, by quickly tapping a series of three or four buttons in between regular steps.  The power-ups give you a brief respite from steps, double your points for a short period, and offer other advantages.  Do you really need an advantage, though?  I ask because Jungle Book is awfully easy as this sort of thing goes.  I breezed through the game on the Expert level of difficulty (there are six levels, including the unlockable Crazy) without even coming close to losing a single dance.  Granted I'm good at these sorts of games, relatively speaking, but I didn't even find it particularly challenging most of the time.  The hardest steps you'll hit are three or four quarter-beats in succession, and rarely do they alternate in any complex way - it's usually something like left-left-up or up-up-right-right, which is easy to do given how much time the game provides for you to see it coming.  The steps flow pretty slowly in most songs (Shere Khan's being one exception) and you can plan your moves well in advance.  Graphics  Jungle Book's realtime graphics aren't particularly impressive at all (dance sequences just consist of two characters set in a 2D background, and the animation routines are simple and repetitive), but its visual presentation is lifted a good deal by the excellent FMV cutscenes - every level is divided by lengthy, well-animated CG movies.  The whole presentation roughly corresponds to the plot of the film, as Mowgli meets the various denizens of the jungle, out-dances them, lights Shere Khan's tail on fire, and eventually finds a home with his fellow humans.  I would also be remiss if I failed to mention the instruction FMV, a live-action movie which introduces the gameplay concept.  Depending on your perspective, it's either very funny or very disturbing, but in any case it's worth checking out.   Sound  D'you like Jungle Book music?  Because that's all there is.  Seriously, from beginning to end, there's just the Jungle Book tracks directly from the movie, including all the ones that have probably been stuck in your head since childhood - ~Bare Necessities,~ et cetera.  They're good songs as Disney music go, but unless you've got a serious fetish for Disney music, you're going to run out of patience with this stuff pretty darn quick.  That's the main problem with Rhythm 'n' Groove.  Why make a music game with so little variety to its music?  Did it not occur to Ubi Soft that folks might get a little tired of eight or ten songs, especially when all those songs sound more or less alike?  There's a reason DDR has grown to such moronic proportions with 4th and 5th Mix: there is no such thing as too much music in a game like this.  To have so few songs, in such a tight genre concentration, is to create a painfully limited game.I think I have to run down the list here.  Compared to Jungle Book Rhythm 'n' Groove, Dance Dance Revolution has more music, an infinitely broader selection of music, better music in my opinion, a wider array of difficulty levels, more mode selections, more cool hidden stuff, and dancing Slinky aliens instead of dancing bears.  Compared to DDR, Jungle Book has more FMV and dancing bears instead of dancing Slinky aliens (I have to assume that there's a segment of the audience out there that would actually prefer dancing bears over dancing Slinky aliens, although they all need their heads examined).Some might say that this is a version of DDR that will appeal to a younger audience.  The thing of it is, though, DDR has as much all-ages appeal as any game I've ever seen.  If you disagree, drop by Sunnyvale Golfland of an afternoon, and you can see children about yea high who happen to be better at the game than I am.  It's awfully depressing to think that kids like that might buy Jungle Book and think that this is all they could dance to, thirty-three-year-old tunes from a second-line Disney musical.So wait a couple of months, and this January will see the release of a dancing game with far better music, far more music, and a dance pad that looks many times cooler.  Sit tight, and your patience will be rewarded.", "date": "Nov 30, 2000"}
