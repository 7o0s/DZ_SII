The game made big waves in the gaming world not because of its core concept (a mech simulator), but because of its gargantuan controller, and equally gargantuan price tag. It literally cost as much as an Xbox itself! But did that stop the game from selling well? Not a bit. Every copy of the limited run sold out instantly, with aftermarket prices reaching nearly double the original price.   But was the game any good? Sureto an extent. The AI was kinda shoddy, and missions could get a bit repetitive, but Steel Battalion isn't your average game. More simulator than anything else, the game transcended its gameplay with sheer scope. A monstrous 40-button controller and three foot pedals, not to mention the little details like losing your game save if you failed to eject in time, gave gamers the closest experience they could get to piloting a real mech. And that's saying something.  Initially hearing about the game, we were most excited about the multiplayer possibilities. I remember buying a copy with a fellow coworker, getting all worked up about playing the game on a LAN. Sadly, when we finally booted the game up, we realized there was no LAN play. Or online play. Or any multiplayer whatsoever. The game is perfect for human interaction, yet it lacked any modes to play against other people in. What happened?  Roughly a year later, we finally get what we begged for: multiplayer. Steel Battalion: Line of Contact is an online-only version of Steel Battalion, plain and simple. You must have the controller to play it, but if you don't already have it, you'll have to buy the original package (new shipments have been made), as well as Line of Contact, as it's not offered in a bundle with the controller. That makes your total purchase $250. The question is, is the game worth it?   You still need this. Gameplay Line of Contact is like having the multiplayer portion of Steel Battalion put on a separate disc and sold at full price. This game really is nothing more than Steel Battalion, but with online play. The game features the expected Xbox Live features (optimatch, quick match, etc.) as well as a lobby. Game types are limited, with only Conquest, Battle Royale, and Capture the Container (think CTF) available. Each mode has a number of adjustable parameters so games can cater to a variety of tastes.  The online performance is about par with what we've seen in other Xbox Live games. The thing to remember in Line of Contact is that the game isn't a fast-paced game like Unreal or Quake. In fact, it's almost the polar opposite. Though the game modes are similar, the game moves a much, much slower pace. Granted, you're piloting a giant mech, so you're bound to move slower, but when you die and respawn, you have go through the entire ritual of starting your mech again. If you've ever played the original game, you know that this can take a bit of time - not exactly the thing that you want to be doing during deathmatch. Still, realism is the focus here, and just knowing that you'll have to restart your mech if you die makes you try that much harder to survive. It's borderline frustrating/clever gameplay.  Speaking of clever gameplay, Line of Contact features several cool moves you can perform that make the matches more than just blasting everything that moves. One of the cooler moves is eavesdropping so you can listen in on your opponents' conversations. You can also control the exhaust on your VT to be invisible on radar, use sniper rifles, and use marker shells to force everyone, friendly or not, to show up on radar.       When it comes to customizing mechs, you can change the color of your mech's parts, and you can also adorn your VT with any of the included clipart. But if you're not happy with any of the given designs, you can use the rudimentary paint program to create your very own emblem. This emblem can then later be traded online with other players. Neat, eh? VTs, parts, and replays can also be traded online, giving the player more motivation to go online, create cool graphics, and saving sick replays. Bartering is always a nice feature in online games, and we're glad Line of Contact has included such a feature.   Graphics Like the gameplay, almost nothing has changed in regards to the graphics. But that's not a bad thing by any means. The game still features the gritty, ultra-realistic graphics of the original, displaying an apocalyptic, war-torn world like no other game before it. The player's view is still from the incredibly detailed, animated cockpit that features more dials and screens than the latest Nintendo console. For better or for worse, the game, while limited in graphical scope, has some of the most realistic graphics we've ever seen in game.   The thing is, while everything is presently marvelously, the draw distance could be better, the environments could use more flair, and so on and so on. But the emphasis is on realism, so we're inclined to be more forgiving about any lack of pizzazz.   Sound Sound in Line of Contact is great. The sound of the guns and missiles are huge, effectively conveying the amount of damage about to be dealt, and the surround effects are top-notch. The accurate spatial positioning helps in gameplay, as you can hear what going on all around you. And because mechs are the cars of the future, you can even have your custom soundtrack blaring out of your VT's kickin' sound system. This feature, while found in a number of games, works especially well in Line of Contact because the cockpit view makes you really feel like you're listening to your mech's radio. We particularly liked listening to the Wrens' The Meadowlands and the Unicorns W.W.C.O.H.W.W.G. while destroying the competition.      Line of Contact is a tricky game. Because the game in its entirety shouldve been included the first time around, its hard to imagine paying full price for it. It is, after all, more like an expansion pack than a full game. If you already own the original game, and have been dying for online play, then its a no-brainer: buy this game. To those of you who dont already have the controller, remember that you have to buy the entire original package as well as Line of Contact to hop online. And to those that bought the original and didnt like it, well, Line of Contact isnt going to change your mind.$250 dollars is a lot of money, but if you can get past the incredibly steep learning curve, and want to experience what piloting a real mech is like (online no less), its definitely worth picking up Steel Battalion and Line of Contact. Theres simply nothing out there that can offer anything remotely similar.", "date": "Mar 4, 2004"}
