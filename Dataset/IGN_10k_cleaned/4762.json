{"name": "Malice", "name_review": "Malice", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/06/08/malice-2", "text": "For a game that's been in development for such a long time (over four years), that was hyped as being something original and ~the next big thing,~ I would have expected Argonaut's Malice to have taken some chances, done something innovative. But no, after spending five hours with the big M (that's all it takes to beat the game!), I can assure you, the only chance Argonaut took with this game was putting its reputation on the line. Malice is, from top to bottom, about as standard and, unfortunately, boring a platformer as you can find. None of it is bad, but sadly, nothing about Malice is fun, interesting, exciting, new, or worth your thirty bucks.   Tell Us A Story The story, what little there is, begins with young Malice coming to the end of her life, beheaded by the evil Dog God (don't write me angry letters, I didn't name him). Seems the original D-O-G wants to destroy the world and -- thanks to Malice's ineptitude against the Dog God -- he's pretty much done so. She's not even good enough for the afterlife, so the Grim Reaper casts her back out into the remains of her world so she can sort the whole mess out. She's met by a strange guide made of gears whose small and uninteresting rotating platform serves as the hub world, connecting Malice to the eight different areas found in the game.   That's pretty much where the story ends. What follows over the next five hours is a hodge-podge of poorly written and badly acted dialogue that tries to be funny (and occasionally succeeds), but has no real connection to any close to a compelling story. Malice's guide offers a never-ending series of clues as to what needs to be done in each level. Why this is necessary remains a mystery since every level has the same premise -- you whack everything in sight with your hammer and collect the necessary items (be it coins, gears, or parts) to proceed to the next area. Your overall goal is to beat each boss and earn another important Key to unlock the final door that leads to the Dog God.    Beat It Malice comes equipped with heavy pounding weapons (from club to mallet and finally to a whacking blade) and a whole lot of attitude. Now, a game where you just run around and beat the crap out of things while performing very simplistic and easy platforming tasks could work. Mindless entertainment is not a bad thing at all, but the first rule is that it has to be entertaining. You have two attacks with Malice's weapons. One is a quick swipe, the other a powerful downward slam to the ground. Every enemy can be beaten with just a few swipes and you can actually stand still and keep swinging and let the enemies run right into your club, killing themselves. A little later in the game, the ante is upped by enemies with guns, but by then Malice has learned magic that can shield her from bullets.   Sound easy? It is. Malice is an absolute cakewalk. My platforming skills are pretty good, it's the one genre where I definitely excel. Still, I've never played a platformer where -- from start to finish the first time out -- I never died once. That's right, I played Malice straight through and never came anywhere close to dying. The game does not want you to fail or feel challenged. It's one of the easiest games I've ever played. This game is so vanilla, so easy, and so straightforward, it's hard to believe this could ever have been hyped as anything beyond another standard platformer.  There's only one interesting level in the game, one spot where I thought, ~Hey, maybe this game is gonna start picking things up.~ This is the gear world, where Malice must solve some platforming puzzles, jump on rotating gears, and maneuver radio-controlled robots to door switches. Very cool stuff, actually. However, this is about a third through the game and once the level is done, it's back to the same standard stuff. Swing, kill, find items, repeat.      Things do get another switch-up towards the end of the game, when Malice is captured and must sneak through some vents in search of her mallet. The stealth is very simplistic, but at least adds a bit of complication to the game as you'll need to use the security cameras to spot the 'roided-up Heckell and Jeckell villains patrolling the hallways. There are also a couple of boss battles towards the end that were worthy of platforming praise, but all of that gets ruined by the final boss, who's a tedious, drawn-out bore of a battle, easy to beat, but it will take a good 15 minutes to do so.   Like I said, this game is very easy and is made easier thanks to all of the healthy hearts dropped by nearly every enemy. You also earn eight magic spells through the course of the game. These keep things interesting, in a fashion, but they also make the game even easier. Once you get the heal spell, foggedaboudit! Seriously, if you die during Malice, you should retire from gaming. Go Jordan and play minor league ball or something.  If Only I were Deaf and Blind... Where the gameplay is consistently flat, the visuals and sound have a very manic ebb and flow of good and bad. The dialogue, for the most part, is amateurish and a lot of the voice actors sound like game testers pulled into the studio at the last minute. I can practically hear them flipping the pages (not literally, but you know, in my head). Most bizarre of the sounds comes from Malice who, for some reason, sounds like she's at the edge of ecstasy each time she collects another of the life-bar expanding magic hearts -- ~Uh, oh, ohhhhhh!~ But there are a few key lines, particularly later on, that are actually somewhat clever and one or two that are funny. However, those are few and far-between.  The visuals suffer from the same good-and-bad syndrome. Actually, for the PS2 it's just ~eh~ and ~oh God!~ with loads of jaggies everywhere, bland textures for many places, and bright lighting effects that fail to look flashy. The Xbox fairs much better. Some areas are pretty bland and have some tearing and weak textures, but then other spots, especially where it's more industrial-looking, have some absolutely knockout textures with chips in the walls, corroded pipes, and some great light reflections on the ground. But it's only in some parts of the game. Other areas look just a slight notch up from the PS2 version. It's baffling. Malice, herself, looks pretty good, but the personality they try to inject into her falls flat. Ah, well.    Wha' Happened?!? At one point Malice was set to feature the voice of Gwen Stefani and the music of No Doubt. Those days are gone. So, apparently, are the morphing abilities of Malice's Clockwork Hammer and the impressive graphics. Three E3's back, Malice was shown and while the gameplay wasn't there, the visuals were pretty sweet. A grassy area that now features some rather weak nubs of grass once had four-foot high blades that Malice would run through. The framerate was ass, but the game looked like it was going to be a real knockout. Looks like we all got suckerpunched. Heck, check out screenshots from as late as January -- there are creatures in those screenshots that never appear in the final game. What gives?? I have ragged on Malice pretty hard, but that's because I spent a night playing it instead of doing something enjoyable -- like sleeping or watching Full House. Overall it's a serviceable game. It doesn't have lots of bugs, it doesn't have any flawed design or any frustrating areas whatsoever. It's just boring. It's not horrible, it's just not fun. Why give me a hammer if there are no puzzles that require you to use that hammer in a creative way? Instead it's all collection quests. And why give Malice eight spells and never require any of them for the puzzles? The magic is insignificant, in the end, because you can complete the entire game without ever using a single spell. So why even have spells at all? Malice isn't visionary and certainly isn't extraordinary. It's pretty bland.", "date": "Jun 8, 2004"}
