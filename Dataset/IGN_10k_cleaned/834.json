Where it became painfully clear that the software house, realizing that the finished product wasn't shaping up to the original vision, decided to keep chugging forward anyway until it had something cohesive enough to dump onto store shelves? Well, welcome to the nightmare of Battlezone: Rise of the Black Dogs - a game that attempts to bring together 3D, action, and real-time strategy elements in planetary environments, but is ultimately so ill-conceived that it manages to set new lows even in this post-Superman N64 world. What's even more painful are the few glimmers present here and there of innovative ideas, which are unfortunately buried so far underneath the mountain of mediocrity that they fail to redeem this miserable title.FeaturesThree game modes: Arcade mode, mission-based Pilot mode, and real-time strategy based Commander modeThree available factions to choose from: Americans, Soviets, and the Black Dog renegadesOver 14 different vehicles to pilotOver 30 unique weaponsEnvironmental and weather effects including lava, fog, rivers, and lightningFour-player modeStorylineMech-like battles on planets and moons. Though the game has three factions - American, Soviets, and Black Dog, there is no backstory to explain why these groups exist. There is no explanation in the manual as to why there are godless commies in space, nor any reason given for the existence of the so-called ~Black Dog~ rebels. According to the manual, the Americans have set up a base on the Dark Side of the moon to research some recently discovered alien artifacts. The Soviets have also set up a base to steal said research. The Black Dog rebels aren't even mentioned in the manual, so it's unclear exactly what relation they have to the overall plot.GameplayBattlezone claims that players have access to three unique game modes (Arcade, Pilot, and Commander), but they all boil down to basically the same thing: drive around bland, boring outer-space environments in your hover tank and blow stuff up. The control is reminiscent of the Turok series - movement is via the C buttons and the view is controlled with the analog stick. The various tanks are fairly easy to control but as they are big, lumbering vehicles they really aren't all that much fun to drive around. The game does not capture the experience of piloting a big war machine at all - you get the sense of plodding speed, but with no feel for the awesome power that driving a huge tank should entail the pace is just listless and slow.  Arcade mode is as simple as it gets: you are simply dumped into the middle of a battlefield with the only objective being survival. Forced to fight wave after wave of enemies, the game ends when you are either destroyed or you quit out of sheer boredom. It's usually the latter, unfortunately. The relentless repetition and near-total lack of payoff for victory doom this mode pretty quickly.The mission-based Pilot mode attempts to broaden gameplay by adding objective-based missions to the game. Though it sounds interesting on paper, once again  the reality just doesn't live up to the promise. Players quickly learn the missions generally follow the same plan - drive to nav point, destroy building, drive to nav point, blah blah blah. The overly repetitive missions gel together and after playing just a few become dull. Though there are three campaigns, one for each faction, none of them are very distinct from one another - they all have similar missions, with access to similar vehicles and weaponry. It doesn't feel so much like three different campaigns as one campaign with minor variations. The third and most potentially interesting mode is the Commander mode. This mode attempts to graft a sort of real-time strategy structure on top of the mission-based gameplay, with mixed results. In Commander mode players have the ability to manage resources, build and command units, and fortify bases against enemy attack. Success hinges upon shrewd management of resources and the tactical deployment of units. Lamentably, the biggest challenge of Commander mode is not the canny tactics of a superior AI, but rather horribly unintuitive controls and a confusing command interface that makes ordering units around far more difficult than necessary.Multi-PlayerBattlezone really drops the ball when it comes to multiplayer. There is so much potential here, it's just too bad that the developers failed to capitalize on any of that promise. Though there is support for up to four players, there isn't really any compelling multiplayer experience to be found. There are three multiplayer modes: Deathmatch, Racing, and Strategy. Deathmatch mode is exactly what you would expect - a simple kill or be killed player vs player scenario. Whoever has the most kills at the end of the time limit wins the match. Tepid, pedestrian stuff. Racing mode is an absolutely ludicrous addition to the game. Players have to run laps around a course by traveling from nav point to nav point and picking each other off along the way. Obviously, the first person to complete the course wins. The problem is that racing big, bulky tanks over the featureless moon surface just isn't all that exciting or fun. It's an absurd premise and it adds nothing to the game.Strategy mode, though filled with multiplayer potential, doesn't fail to disappoint. The word ~strategy~ in this case is a complete misnomer. Imagine being able to build up your forces and lead them into battle against your friends. Imagine being able to conduct a full scale space-age ground war against up to three of your pals. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? Well, keep imagining, because you can't do any of this cool stuff. In this so-called ~strategy~ mode each player is simply assigned three drone ships that follow him around and attack the other players on sight. You can't even give orders to your drones - they simply follow you around like dumb animals, blasting away mindlessly when someone else gets too close. What a complete waste of a great idea.GraphicsI'm sure you've heard the tale about the monkeys and Shakespeare. The one that says that if you give a bunch of monkeys some typewriters and enough time, by banging away at the typewriters they will eventually come up with Hamlet. Well, it seems that the folks at Climax tried the same strategy with their 3D engine. Only this time they didn't have enough time or enough monkeys (though one can never have enough monkeys). The graphics are so ugly and so glitch-ridden that they inspired fits of laughter in the IGN64 staff. Though the frame rate moves along at a brisk clip, even in multiplayer, this is probably due to the fact that the environments are so bland and so empty that there is little for the hardware to choke up on. The moon or Mars don't exactly offer a whole lot of variety when it comes to the scenery. We tried the game with and without the Expansion Pak and except for a slight increase in crispness it didn't seem to make that much of a difference. Boring, simplistic tank models don't add much either. Battlezone includes a catalog of nearly every N64 graphics  clich that gamers have come to know and despise. Feel your eyes strain at the indistinct, blurry graphics. Lose yourself in fog so thick that it is impossible to get your bearings or see more than a few murky feet in front of you. Marvel at stars that look remarkably like tapioca pudding splattered against the wall. Watch an overuse of dithering so bad that Matt was even compelled to jokingly refer to the game's world as D'Earth, or Dither-Earth. Far more serious than the unmemorable graphics, however, are the bugs that would be hilarious if they weren't so atA good idea gone bad in execution. While controlling super-sized space-mechs of sorts through a variety of galactic environments with a mix of real-time strategy and action elements sounds great, none of it it comes together as planned. The end result is really just a colossal waste. You have to wonder whether the developers had any familiarity with the platform at all -- everything is numbingly monotonous and repetitive, no matter how the designers tried to dress it up. Plus, the game is so full of gameplay bugs and graphical glitches that it's hard to believe it's actually a finished product and not some beta version -- and this is based on the final, boxed copy of the title. The sad part is that there were some good ideas in the Battlezonee, like the real-time strategy based Commander mode. Too bad they're buried under so much junk. Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this one.", "date": "Apr 4, 2000"}
