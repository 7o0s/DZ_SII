Both games have a top-down perspective, both games have dozens of tiny tanks and men running around the screen, and both games use a mouse and keyboard interface to control combat in real-time. So is this just another real-time strategy game, whimsically set on the Russian steppes rather than some apocalyptic wasteland or futuristic moon?  No, no, no. Close Combat 3 is a realistic, squad-based, tactical wargame set during World War II. Let's look at what that means and why it is so much fun.  Close Combat III is realistic. Weapon data is drawn from the actual arms used by the armies on the East Front, up to and including the different versions of the tanks that were produced year by year. Every weapon has its chances of hitting and penetrating its target. Every bullet in every soldier's pack is tracked by the game, and everyone will run out of ammo eventually. Soldiers with heavier guns run slower. Tanks get stuck. Weapons jam. Etc., etc. It's realistic almost to a fault.  Close Combat III is also squad-based. This means every man on the field represents one real soldier. He even has a name, you can look it up. He has a squad leader, and if his leader's head is blown off by a stray tank round, that soldier probably isn't going to fight as effectively for the rest of the battle. In fact, he might not fight at all, having reached the sensible conclusion that by running away, he might have a chance of living one more day.  Close Combat III is also tactical. What this means is that you are not burdened with larger strategic commands--it is not your job to win the war. You are just an infantry commander on the ground with your troops. It's enough that your job is just to win today's fight, stay alive for another day. You decide, minute by minute, how the disposition and movement of your forces can best accomplish your assigned objectives, but the time and place to fight is not really your decision.  So Close Combat III is about as far away as you can get from the simplified abstractions of a C&C-type game, which tend to be very easy to learn yet still fun to play. So yes, some time must be spent learning how to play Close Combat II, but it's time well spent. You don't have to spend hours learning the interface--that can be explained in a couple minutes. No, you spend your time mastering the subtleties of the battlefield, making this game a richer and more rewarding experience throughout.  However when you first play Close Combat III, you're likely to be overwhelmed. You'll move a few men forward, run some tanks up, and then suddenly all hell breaks loose. Gunfire from you don't know where rips your men to shreds. Your tanks are smoking ruins and your soldiers are running away--yes running away!, something you've never seen in a computer game before--someone is yelling about a sniper, bombs seem to be falling out of nowhere, and now suddenly the enemy tanks are coming around the bend and machine-gunning your troops. And while you're trying to absorb all this information, process it, and make some decisions, the game is already over. The battle is lost. Probably a lot of people who've played the demo simply give up at this point.  Well, victory is neither to the swift nor the strong, but to the experienced, cautious commander. Close Combat involves a lot of skills that you probably will not have learned in other games. You must pay attention to audio cues. Your first warning about a sniper or a team under fire will come over the audio. You will learn to pick out the whiz of a mortar shell or rumble of a tank tread, even if you can't see those units. You must also pay attention to visual cues. You'll learn lines of fire, Those little puffs of white smoke around your tank are not good. You must spend as much time placing your men before each battle, examining lines of sight and the quality of the team's cover. And during the battle you must learn to react instantly and correctly to everything that happens. When you see puffs of white smoke popping up around your T-34 battle tank, back away. Something is firing AT rounds at you. You can't afford to lose that tank. This game will school you in the basic principles of squad level tactical combat, as practiced in World War II.  Assuming you get the idea of the game, how does Close Combat III stack up to the other games in the series? I've reviewed all three games in this series; each has been a major improvement over its predecessor and each has ended up one of my favorite games of the year. But Close Combat III is by far and away the best in the series. The scope of the game been magnified; this installment covers in snapshot fashion all of the major battles between Russian and Germany during World War II, including Stalingrad, the single most significant battle of the 20th Century. The leader counters from the first game, absent in the second, have also returned, and the leaders themselves have been made more significant, as a leader's radius of command and control is now modeled in the game. The interface has also been improved; now, during the setup of phase where you place your units, you can now specify the facing of your units, a critical distinction, and one of paramount importance when dealing with tanks, the single most important kind of unit you command.  That said, the game is not perfect--the menu screens between games are a little busy and at times unclear; for example, no list of previously saved games appears when you save your current game, a violation of one of the most basic rules of computer game interfaces. And while the interface is consistently drawn in a Close Combat style of graphics throughout, when the player has to type something in, the game reverts to ugly grey Windows dialogue boxes.   But most galling of all is that the designers somehow messed up the Results screen, which is where you go after each battle and examine how your soldiers fared--whether they gained experience, medals, how many soldiers or vehicles they killed, etc. This can actually be quite instructive; one learns, for example, the relative value of tanks, machine guns and mortars in killing enemies, or which team's placement on the map was most effective. (It also diverting to watch a particularly lucky team grow battle by battle from a pack of clumsy rookies to a heavily decorated crack squad.) Well, in Close Combat II you could get all this info on one handy screen, but for some reason in Close Combat III you must dick around with multiple tabs to get the same basic information. What happened?  But this is no game breaker--and belaboring a point about an interface snafu hardly detracts from the overall experience. Close Combat III is an excellent game, well worth your consideration.  --Jason Bates", "date": "Jan 19, 1999"}
