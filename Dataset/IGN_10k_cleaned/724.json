There's only one way to do a 3D perspective style racer on the system (behind the vehicle), and the game seemed to do the best job at that technique. With Top Gear Pocket 2, Kemco has taken the original concept and expanded on it fully, creating one of the most complete and fun behind-the-car racers on the Game Boy Color. Features Hidden cars and tracks Battery Back-up Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Color  The sequel, much like the original, is a rally-style racing game where you race laps around closed-circuit courses, trying to get from last place to first place before crossing the finish line on the last lap. Cars are spaced out in such a way that you're only fighting one vehicle at a time for his position. Championship Modes are spread out into seasons, each more difficult than the next...but you can also opt to simply practice on specific courses  and you'll be able to adjust the conditions between four types: sunny, rainy, snowy, and nighttime, each with its own course feel.  But don't think for a second that Kemco's repackaging the existing game a second time  everything about the original design has been enhanced and improved in some way.  New to the game is a point system where you earn points based on the place you've finished. You take these points and convert them into improvements to your vehicle, whether it's acceleration, top speed, handling, or braking.  The graphics engine has also been upgraded --  cars have been increased in size with more detail, the viewing screen is a lot larger with less ~letter-boxing,~ and the road now has a textured look on the dirt and snow tracks. Opponent AI is now a lot smarter and vary from vehicle to vehicle  for example, one opponent might do everything in its power to prevent you from passing, where another is only trying to take a turn properly. The only omission is the rumble cartridge has been scrapped for the sequel. No big loss.  Handling has also been improved from the original game. This is the first racing game on the portable that has an ~analog~ feel to it, an element that makes you take care around corners  -- it actually makes you feel the need to hit the brakes instead of going balls-out through the turns. The game doesn't cheat in the traditional Game Boy racing sense  you can actually see through the turn at the hazards approaching.  There are a few tiny bits where I have a problem  the collision detection in the original game was more favorable than what's in Top Gear Pocket 2. When you hit a vehicle in this game, whether it's from the side or rear, your car seems to go through the car while it slows down. It felt like the cars had more substance when they collided in the original game  but on the flipside, I'm glad that your car doesn't spin out in this game like it did in the original. Nothing's more annoying than watching your vehicle spin out of control for five precious seconds  the only things that slow down your vehicle in Top Gear Pocket 2 are going off-road and bumping into the opponent's vehicles. No spinouts.  The link cable mode is a nice touch, and always a good addition to any Game Boy Color game. But in this game's case it's not really worth playing, since the game has a super annoying ~catch-up~ feature that keeps you and your opponent close during the race. The only real challenge is trying to keep behind the other person and guess when the final stretch approaches so you can win. I couldn't find an option to turn this off  and worse, no matter who wins, the game tells each of the players that they are the winner. That's nice, but I'd prefer to rub it in the face with a ~You Lost~ screen for the person who came in second.    Top Gear Pocket 2 is definitely the best behind-the-vehicle racing game on the Game Boy Color so far. Other than the thrown-together two player mode, the game shows that it's been appropriately tweaked and refined as a quality racing game on the handheld. The racing does get a little tedious after a few seasons, but the increasing difficulty does offer the proper challenge later in the game. I like it a lot.", "date": "Feb 19, 2000"}
