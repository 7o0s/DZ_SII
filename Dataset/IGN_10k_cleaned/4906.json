{"name": "Bomberman", "name_review": "Bomberman", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/08/19/bomberman-2", "text": "has to be one of the most beloved franchises in gaming. Versions of the venerable action/puzzle game have popped up on systems as varied as the NES, TurboGrafx, and Saturn. And now, thanks to Hudson Soft, Bomberman is making a guest appearance on Nokia's N-Gage. But does this series still have some gunpowder left in it after all these years?   Features:   8 worlds  Boss stages  Bluetooth multiplayer   With the exception of a few outings (such as N64, GameCube, and a selection of karting games), Bomberman is pretty much the same game today that it was well over a decade ago. This isn't exactly saying the franchise has stalled, but like Taito's Bust-a-Move series, you have to wonder just how many versions of regular, top-down Bomberman Hudson Soft can crank out before somebody taps them on the shoulder. There are only so many die-hards in this world that cannot wait to spend another $30 on the further (yet same-same) adventures of Bomberman.   Sorry to say, but this is indeed the same Bomberman we've been playing for years. As the little bulby fella, you must run around the maze-like stages, blasting apart bricks (and brick-like) obstacles to unlock bomb power-ups and fry enemies. Upgrades increase your bomb's blast radius, as well as up the number of bombs you can carry. There are also speed increases, dinosaurs to ride, and safety vests that temporarily protect you from bomb blasts. And if you get blowed up or touch an enemy creature? You lose everything you worked for. No multiple bombs, no dinosaur, no nothing. Square one.   Bomberman offers plenty of play time -- you just need to ask yourself if it's really worth it this time out. With eight full worlds comprised of five levels each, including boss encounters, that's a lot of bombing. Which you've been doing for years. Many Bomberman purists will be pleased to hear this, as they've turned their nose up at recent entries in the series like Bomberman Jetters.   Bomberman for the N-Gage sports a very dated 16-bit look. Some people may call it 'classic' or 'retro,' but in this case, the game seem like a rushed port of an old chapter of the franchise. Even worse, the animation is not just off -- it's way off. Herky-jerky off. Little Bomberman and his enemies stagger around the screen like they just woke up from a two-week bender. Newcomers may just wonder why the game seems a little wonky; seasoned fans will be crushed.   Many mazes are squeezed into the N-Gage's vertical screen, which truly lessens the playing field although some worlds offer some limited scrolling. As it is, these tiny mazes aren't all that challenging, and it really limits strategy when playing two-player. Why couldn't we have scrolling, multi-player arenas?   Bomberman allows two players to 'splode each other over Bluetooth. We were really hoping for four players (and with bigger mazes, even more would be better -- remember how cool Bomberman was on the Saturn with ten players?), but considering the size constraints, two probably is for the best. It's just that this demands to be a party game, and there's no party happening here. Not even any N-Gage Arena functionality, which a game like Bomberman really deserved. Considering the dated visuals, you would think that something would have been possible.  Man, how do you blow Bomberman? Maybe if this was a cheapie port from some cut-rate dev house, it would be slightly more understandable -- but this came straight from Hudson Soft itself. The jerky animation and smallish mazes really mess with the game play. This is one of those few times when Bomberman just wasn't fun to me, and I'm a big Bomberman fan. I own more versions of the game than I probably need. But as disappointed as I am in his tame, jittery version, I just cannot recommend it -- especially to fans of the franchise.", "date": "Aug 19, 2004"}
