Dedicated old-school RPG fans have been waiting at least that long for this day to come, as it's taken all that time (since the Wii launch 15 months ago) for a Phantasy Star game to finally come to the Virtual Console. And now that it's here, a new generation of fans can discover the series that SEGA players swore by in the late '80s and early '90s.   Phantasy Star II is the game we're getting, as the first Phantasy Star was an 8-bit Master System release and that console has yet to be added to the Virtual lineup. But II is still a fine place to start with the series, as it's the first installment in the franchise to have appeared on the 16-bit Genesis, and a pioneering game for the turn-based role-playing genre in the United States.   Science fiction is its theme, as Phantasy Star II takes place in a futuristic universe where humans live in colonies spread across three different planets, and order is maintained across the worlds by a massive supercomputer called the Mother Brain. The story opens on a young man named Rolf who's being plagued by nightmares, and his half-human, half-monster friend Nei  the two of them are tasked to set out from their hometown and find out why the Mother Brain has allowed the population of dangerous monsters roaming the planets to grow unchecked. They equip themselves and head out into the unknown.   Most of Phantasy Star II plays out in perfectly traditional RPG style, as beginning with Rolf and Nei's outset from home you enter into the standard role-playing progression of traveling from town to town, fighting random monster battles, leveling up and acquiring new party members along the way. Those who've played any other RPG from the 8-bit or 16-bit generations should know what to expect, as most of the game's core elements are shared with other popular franchises from the time, like Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy. Where Phantasy Star sets itself apart, though, is in its considerable level of difficulty and engaging storyline.   Battles play out against the backdrop of a grid, while your party members stand at attention in the foreground of the scene.  The challenge is intense. In its original release as a SEGA Genesis cartridge, Phantasy Star II came bundled along with a sizeable instruction manual/hintbook to help players find their way through the game's many challenges. You won't find that same book here, though, so you might want to track down a solid FAQ/Walkthrough online and have it open for reference when you hit a roadblock in the quest.   The storyline is engaging not because it betters more recent role-playing plotlines, because it's still fairly limited compared to modern efforts. But it's engaging because at the time of Phantasy Star II's original release in 1989, it was almost unheard of for a console game to have this many memorable characters and this much development of plot. While the NES Dragon Warrior centered on a nameless protagonist and the first Final Fantasy starred an equally generic lineup of no-back-story warriors, each of Phantasy Star II's heroes has his or her own personality, strengths and weaknesses, and ultimate destiny to achieve. It's intriguing, and it's easy to see why the Phantasy brand and mythology continued to grow after this game's release.   A negative to level against this old-school RPG is its potential for tedium, as, like many other entries into the genre from that same era, you'll have to do a lot of grinding through a lot of random battles. You simply can't charge off into the full adventure with guns blazing, as your party will be far too underpowered and far too easily wiped out if you try it  instead, you'll often have to take time to hover around a friendly town and fight 10, 20 or 100 random battles to make your fighters level up and get stronger.    And it can take a while to adjust to the old style of the menu system found here, which truncates words into nonsensical abbreviations and limits character names to four letters apiece. The combination of these issues is mastering the menus while inside random battles  the default option is ~FGHT,~ which automatically handles your attacks, targeting and defense and is the easiest way to go, but there's also ~STGY~ which lets you strategize your priorities and tactics more slowly and methodically.In the end, Phantasy Star II is an impressive example of classic old-school role-playing. Its most notable positive traits are its unique setting and theme  especially since it's the first and only Phantasy Star game to come to the Virtual Console so far  and its epic overall length. You'll get a lot of lasting value for your investment of 800 Wii Points, as this quest could take you 40 hours or more to complete. The negatives that might keep you from cashing in the eight bucks right away, though, would be the considerable level of challenge and the potential for tedium. Only buy Phantasy Star II if you know you'll be prepared to spend a significant amount of time taking care of old-school RPG ~chores~ like level-grinding  because without that willingness, your experience in going after the Mother Brain might not last very long.", "date": "Feb 18, 2008"}
