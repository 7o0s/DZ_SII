She's always after Dalmatians in her interminable greed, but why won't she learn that these dogs are too clever and quick to catch, even with her cracked staff  of daft dog catchers. This time, she needs the dogs to power her vanity toy factory, which manufactures a line of Cruella DeVil toys for kids to admire her. She thinks their free labor will cut costs of the astronomically priced Cruella dolls and toys, making it more affordable to wade in this woman's narcissism. What a witch!   Features:  Based on the blockbuster live-action movie and animated Dalmatian cartoons Fantastic animation and vivid graphics Password save for continued play Only for Game Boy Color    Disney's blockbuster movie 102 Dalmatians may not be the most soulful movie out for children this holiday season -- by the numbers, the film is a very calculated cash cow sequel to a movie that need not be re-made in the first place -- but taken lightly and ignoring the myriad of toy tie-ins and McDonald's Happy Meal freebies, it's possible to look at the movie for what it is. And that is, very simply, an enjoyable, silly, effects-filled two hours with cute dogs to cuddle up with.  And Activision's Game Boy Color version of 102 Dalmatians, developed by Digital Eclipse with much flair and fancy, is only that. Innovation is not in this dog's vocabulary -- it's a game where animals hop on moving platforms and try to find keys -- but the gameplay is solid in its basic elements, and the graphics shine like cat's eyes. This dog knows no new tricks, but might it still win your heart with a few simple stunts?  Where 102 Dalmatians excels is in the clever level design and extraordinary animation. There are only a few types of surfaces here -- floating platforms, moving lifts, and locked blockades, mostly drawn in a straight horizontal. Coming up with cohesive and constantly different levels with just those three types of surface and a handful of enemies seems impossible, but the creativity across each stage impressed me all the way to the end. Factory stages felt claustrophobic and jangled, with tough jumps and strange platform placement, while Ms. DeVil's apartment complex is organic and straightforward, concentrating on enemies rather than tough gaps. One stage gives an homage to Donkey Kong. Even the standard icy level seems especially well crafted in this title. The stages may prove quite challenging to explore and find everything in, since they're so big and sprawling, and Digital Eclipse should really have gone with unlimited extra lives for a game aimed so young, but the worlds are so varied that children won't get bored and probably will not ever quit until the end, even out of frustration.  The levels are sharp in creativity, and just as sharp in beauty. Though not as dazzling as can be done on the Game Boy Color, the levels are clean and vibrantly drawn. From the color scheme of each stage, it's quite intuitive which graphics are platforms and which are background, even with the intricately detailed, multitiered stages. They're also smartly integrated -- some of the moving platforms are attached to forklifts or wires, making them seem less a fabrication of the designers. There are also a lot of nice additions in the background, such as the animated silhouette of workers in the factory or the witty signs in the cafeteria that say ~Work Harder!~ and ~Eat Faster!~  And the animation in this game really speaks for the quality of Disney and Digital Eclipse productions. From the opening FMV to the character animation, the game is alive with motion. The pups are so detailed, their ears flop when they're leaping. Each character has extremely sharp, detailed motions, and even in simple things like taking a hit, there's simple but well-drawn effects drawn over the enemy sprites to show the attack hit, such as when one toy scraps up in a dust ball when the puppy barks at it and knocks it off its wheels. And the huge Cruella DeVil at the end, with her long flowing fur coat and exaggerated mannerisms, is one of the sharpest characters I've ever seen come to life on the system.  But even at this level of supreme production values, and even with gameplay that holds enjoyable over a dozen stages, It's tough to shake the feeling from this game that, outside of the appeal of the dogs, there's not much here. The enemies are all generic toys without much appeal, including blimps and toy cars. Bosses simply throw balls -- even the dog catchers don't have their necessary net to snag the pups. At the beginning of a stage, you choose which dog to play as, but it's a cosmetic difference of two spots on the fur, as both dogs move the same and look quite similar. It's a visual stunner in it's characters, but with bosses spread out across dozens of stages and no appearance of Waddlesworth or maybe Seargent Tibbs to brighten up the game's lonely stages.  Gameplay in 102 Dalmatians is very simple, with strong control but little excitement. The challenges are all of the ~Find the Key~ variety, except for some of the simplistic bosses. And aside from some bonus lives, there's nothing hidden in the stages to encourage exploration beyond simply tripping around to collect all the cages. Control is very basic -- 'A' jumps, and 'B' barks, and that's the game.     I'd still suggest this game for any young player with a strong attention span attracted to these adorable dogs -- if they're a fan of the movie, this is a fun adventure with cute animals as the rescuers -- but as a game, it's just too limited to stand out. Classy graphics and clever levels speak well for the designers, but overall the experience is still limited and hollow. And with awful mini-games (one with a basic Memory matching game, the other a color paint program -- how is this fun?), there's no reason to play the game again once it's finished. 102 Dalmatians a stylish and solid game, but you'd expect as much from a Disney title, and in this case, you'd expect more.", "date": "Dec 14, 2000"}
