Back in June of 2002, Capcom announced that its second and third Resident Evil titles would hit the GameCube as ports of the PSX originals.  Both Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis would ship to the Nintendo home console at a somewhat attractive price point: $19.99 U.S.  Like we said, a great plan.  Sure, gamers could already buy either of these classics as new or used PSX titles for even less, but for Nintendo fans that missed them the first go around, it was a great excuse to experience them both for the first time.  Unfortunately, plans change, and Capcom has since dropped the lowball MSRP for a near-standard tag of $39.99.  Why?  We've heard no official reasoning for this price hike.  Capcom must surely think that gamers are more than willing to spend their hard-earned cash on ports of games that are now over three years old.  Over three years old!  Nintendo is currently giving away free copies of it's N64 masterpiece The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, while Capcom is taking their classics back to the bank.  Amazing.  So is Resident Evil 3: Nemesis worth to Cube owners what Capcom thinks it is?  Read on to find out.  The Facts:   Control Jill Valentine through creepy environments in Raccoon City  Tons of classic RE weapons, like the handgun, shotgun, and mini-gun  Ported from the PSX classic released in Nov of 1999  Slightly improved visuals, featuring smoother models and improved textures  For one player only  Gameplay As mentioned several times now, RE3 on the GameCube is taken directly from the PSX version originally released in 1999.  (We'll try not to let you forget that.)  Since it's original PSX release, the title has been ported to many other systems, including both the Dreamcast and the PC.  With each passing re-release of the game, our interest seemed to slowly dwindle.  Not that we didn't enjoy the game during its glorious heyday; in fact, the PSX version garnered our top marks.  But how many times can an antiquated title be shoved back onto the market before it's officially laid to rest?  Capcom is now giving it one more try on the Cube, and the end results are identical to its previous attempts.  RE3 both looks and plays most similarly to the Dreamcast version, which was also a port of the original PSX game.  If you're curious how this version stacks up, be sure to read our previous review right here.  Everything that applies to the Dreamcast copy of the game applies right here; they're practically identical.  The ironic thing is that you could probably purchase both a Dreamcast and a copy of RE3 at your local used-games shop for less than the price of the Cube game alone.  Now that is a scary thought.  If you're still interested at this point and are curious how the game itself plays, what the story involves, etcetera, etcetera, then please allow us to introduce our good friend, Mr. Douglas C. Perry.  Check out Doug's full review of the PSX version and you'll be up to speed on the various gameplay elements in no time.  But as you might expect, the game plays exactly like every other RE game you've ever played.  The control is intact, the doorway transitions are all in place, and you'll even hit the slight pause when changing camera angles -- just like the PSX version.  Cube fans will be happy to know that the Type C control has been added, allowing use of the R button for walking and running.  Overall load speeds may have also been slightly boosted, but the improvement wasn't significant enough for us to take notice.  The bottom line is that RE3 on GameCube plays exactly like the PSX version, and without any added eye candy and atmosphere, the reasons to invest are hurt greatly.    Graphics Suffice it to say, the Cube version makes all of the minor visual enhancements that were found on Sega's console over two years ago.  It's somewhat cleaner than the PSX version, with less dithering on textures and slightly rounded player models.  But you'll definitely notice a lack of anti-aliasing in some areas, such as the fiery explosions in the foreground of the camera.  There are also no added particle effects, no added lighting effects -- no added effects in general.  Although it's a slightly improved port of the PSX game, the core package is still a port, and it shows its age severely.  Admittedly, graphics are not what makes a game fun, and we are certainly thankful that the Cube version still plays with that same classic RE3 feel.  But considering the price point, it's hard to justify the type of visual presentation that you're getting in return.  Sound Thankfully, the audio department doesn't quite show its age nearly as much as the visuals.  Although the sound design is nothing close to Capcom's masterful performance in its Resident Evil remake, RE3 on the Cube sounds just fine.  Considering that the PSX was also a disc-based format, the audio quality hasn't really evolved or digressed in either direction -- it just sounds good.  There's plenty of moody environmental background noises creeping about, such as gusts of wind and cracking stairwells.  It's all of the same great RE style that we've come to love from Capcom, just not to the degree of quality displayed in its two more impressive RE remakes for the system.With the recently re-vamped Resident Evil and Resident Evil Zero titles drawing critical acclaim from everyone here at IGN, it's difficult -- no, impossible -- for either Matt or myself to recommend this game over either of them.  Gamers who are expecting a similar experience with Resident Evil 3: Nemesis are going to be in for quite a letdown.  The gameplay design is still as brilliant as it ever was on the PSX, but the overall package is not even close to earning its sticker price.  However, if you've never owned a PSX and are feeling eerily nostalgic, then you could always consider it as an educational, historical, and enjoyable rental.", "date": "Jan 29, 2003"}
