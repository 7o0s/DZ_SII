Basketball has been an especially disappointing sport on the Game Boy Color, and even though many have tried their hand, none of them made the big leagues. From NBA 3 on 3 with Kobe Bryant to NBA In The Zone, NBA Live,  NBA Showtime, and even Acclaim's last shot NBA Jam 1999, all of the Game Boy basketball titles failed to provide even so much of a good pick-up game. But Acclaim has taken the trip back to the locker room with some new ideas and have revamped their NBA Jam this season. The added features are nice, but how solid is the gameplay's aim? The shot is up, and it's...   Features:  140 NBA Superstars Linked play for multiplayer jamming Only for Game Boy Color    No good! Not to say that it wasn't even close, but... it wasn't even close. Despite a fresh team in the development staff and some really welcome improvements, this game still couldn't handle a moonball, much less a basketball. Partly the problem is that NBA Jam isn't at all suited for the two-button controls of the Game Boy Color, but even copping to that level, there are still so many wrong decisions in NBA Jam's handheld controls -- dating back all the way to the Game Boy Pocket versions by Torus, which this game steals from like Allen Iverson -- and the improved visuals still don't talk the game right.  Running up and down the lanes last year used to be at least a smooth press in NBA Jam. This year, however, the improved graphics slow the game down to a crawl at times. Hopping up for a block is like a Jordan slo-mo show... while the real game takes place on the other side of the court. The development team must have just painted new pixels over the old code of the clunky Jams, because players still cross up the court diagonally much quicker than they do running straight. And when the game's not running slow, it's chopping up in flicker.  All of the improvements in the visuals work against the game itself. The players are yards taller than last year, making them too tall on such a small screen -- the court is zoomed in more to compensate, and between the huge bulky players and the limited view range, there's no room to play basketball in. Against the sub-standard simple graphics of the older versions, the sharply detailed player uniforms and background crowds are a sight better, but the player's heads still have little detail to tell them apart. If it's an arcade game of b-ball, you might as well go with the Big Head mode and hope it does justice. And two years later after NBA Jam '99, the interface graphics are exactly the same.  The one step forward for NBA Jam 2001 is the addition of Link Play mode. And surprisingly, it's a boon on the game's quality. Even though the main game's season is a bear with the sluggish and problematic control, it's somehow a better game of basketball when playing against another player. Turn on Juice Mode for infinite Turbo so that nobody has to make the index-thumb stretch for the Start button, and switch on the Fun Mode option (no jokes, please) for a few hyping power-ups, and suddenly NBA Jam 2001 is a squeaker. I would have assumed that the multi-player would have slowed the game, seeing that no other Jam has supported it, but it's a nice surprise to see the game almost run quicker in Link Play.    So few sports games support Link Play -- look at how much it adds. It's almost enough to bump the score up in this game over last year's poor showing. Even the AI is much more solid in this game. It could never have been a perfect port of Jam, but playing against another baller with the extras on was fun this year.But the gameplay's roots are still rotted -- you still can't pass in the middle of a shot, and you can only do a big dunk at the posts. That's not Jam. Adding the extra flaws this game piles on is like peeing in an unflushed urinal -- it's foamier, but it couldn't possibly stink much worse. And if that image doesn't convince you not to put your hands on these bad basketball games, I'm not sure what will.", "date": "Dec 22, 2000"}
