Now, thanks to Infogrames' fun little strategy platformer, you can realize your dreams.  At first glance this baby might seem like a cast-off title, a franchise name with nothing to offer.  But Infogrames has made certain to put in as many gags and gadgets from the Warner Bros. lot as possible and has managed to pull off a surprisingly good title.   The premise is simple enough; Daffy Duck is hosting a game show challenging Ralph Wolf (not to be confused with Wile E. Coyote) to nab sheep from a variety of cartoon-inspired levels.  Standing in his way is the ever-vigilant Sam Sheep-Dog.  Each level will require a different strategy and use of a variety of ACME products.    Anvils, dynamite, sheep costumes, and remote-controlled robots are just a few of the items at your disposal.  You'll strap on rocket packs, bungee off the sides of cliffs, and catapult sheep over near-bottomless gorges, all in the hopes of stockpiling as many wool critters as possible.   Gameplay Just about every gag in the Looney Tunes library shows up through more than 15 levels of play.  The game is more of a puzzler than a platformer, though it does utilize some platform elements.  The key to each level is figuring out how to use the items given and in what order.  The actually execution is rather simple.   The game is most fun when it comes to the actual snatching of sheep.  You'll have to tip toe around so as not to be heard.  You can hide behind rocks or even hop into some bushes and stealthily make your way toward your prey.   While the game has loads of Looney Tunes characters such as Marvin the Martian and Elmer Fudd, your imagination is held in check.  The game itself is very linear.  Each level must be approached in a specific way in order to clear it.  Even if you find a different way to go about completing a task, it won't work unless you do it the way the designers intended.   And that's what keeps Sheep Raider from being a true classic.  It plays more like Lemmings than Metal Gear Solid.  You don't get to choose which items you want to use from ACME's catalog, instead you must use the specific items provided on each level.  One level you get to dress up as a sheep and convince one of the flock to follow you away from Sam Sheep-Dog, the next level you will have to bungee off a cliff and scoop up an unsuspecting sheep.  Unfortunately, each method is level specific.    Graphics Sheep Raider is one pretty looking PS game.  The animations are smooth and varied and the levels are well-designed and sufficiently cartoony.  Sure, you start out swiping sheep in a quiet meadow, but quickly you will be running across snow and dodging lava.  You will even get to jump back in time using ACME's snazzy time warp clock.   I can't talk up the graphics enough, because they truly are top notch.  Every character looks like they were plucked straight from a Warner Bros. cartoon.   There are occasional camera problems but they are minimal and never lead to your untimely demise.  Playing through the game, I never once hit any slow down.  The game never trips itself up with technical issues.   Sound With all the attention to detail, it's a wonder how this soundtrack ever found its way onto this game.  Rather than using (or at least going for the style of) classic Warner Bros. music, Infogrames lays down a small selection of classical and disco funk background grooves.  The music itself isn't bad, but it fits this game about as wells as your mom's High School cheerleading outfits still fits her.  Eventually you'll be likely to turn the music off and hum the famous Looney Tunes theme to yourself.   Aside from the poorly placed background music, all the bells and whistles of a Looney Tunes cartoon can be found here.  From the accordion sounds of a squished wolf to the clank of an anvil landing squarely on the noggin, you'll swear you were watching a classic Ralph and Sam cartoon.  The sound effects are crisp and cartoony and perfect for the game.Is Sheep Raider a good title to pick up?  Definitely.  Especially if you love Looney Tunes.  The game limits itself greatly by being so linear and is certainly nothing you will play through a second time.  Still, it's good for a lot of laughs and is a lot of fun to play.  The biggest drawback to the game is not being able to choose your ACME items.  Instead of being able to create your own strategies for snatching sheep, you have to follow the designers whim.  With a little variety, there would be reason to come back to this game more than once.  The other flaw to gripe about is a little level imbalance. Almost all of the levels maintain the same difficulty, with one exception. About two-thirds of the way through, you have to face off against Red Monster (furry red dude in sneakers, you know the one... his name really is Red Monster!).  I spent almost as much time trying to beat Red Monster as I did beating the rest of the game leading up to him.  The difficulty comes out of nowhere, with no build-up.   This challenge would have been better suited for the end level. Despite these flaws, Sheep Raider is a lot of fun and is one of the better PS titles I've played recently.  A high recommendation for anyone who digs Looney Tunes.  And for those that don't... what's wrong with you?", "date": "Oct 26, 2001"}
