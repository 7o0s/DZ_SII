Developed by Tecnosoft and premiering way back in the day of the Sega Master System, it has enjoyed continued success across systems including Genesis, Super Nintendo, and Saturn. Now it's on PlayStation, a machine that certainly hasn't been saturated by shooters in its three-year history.  Updated for the late 1990s, the series appears in polygonal form the first time in its five-game run. Remaining true to its roots, however, Thunder Force V is a side-scrolling shooter.   Piloting a highly-maneuverable fighter, you've got to blast through more than five stages, underwater, through jungles, and in space. Five weapons are available (including homing energy orbs and a rear-firing blaster) which can be powered-up, in addition to orbiting options called claws. When fully charged (they recharge on their own), these mini-satellites can discharge a powerful super attack that varies depending on your primary weapon.  True to the shooter formula, each stage is packed with plenty of enemies to unleash these weapons on, including gigantic bosses and pesky mid-bosses. Smaller enemies travel in waves and the bosses have their predictable patterns.  In addition to the standard game, an elaborate museum-style mode has been included which, when fully ~filled~ (unlocking its contents is performance-based) contains production art, a 3D object viewer, music, and more.  The game also features support for the Dual Shock controller's feedback effects and analog input. When in analog mode, your ship can move around the screen at two speeds depending on how far you press the stick. This is furthered by the ability to adjust your ship's rate of movement during gameplay. There's something you should know about me: I'm a huge fan of the shooter genre. Always have been, always will be. Thunder Force has always been one of my favorite series, so when I heard Thunder Force V was being ported to PlayStation, I was naturally excited. Now it's here, and although it's really nothing I haven't played hundreds of times before, I've been loving every minute of it.What I like: the traditional shooter gameplay, the excellent tunes, the frantic action, and the loads of extras. What I don't like: the slowdown, and the fact that, while the game certainly looks good, it's not exactly smashing the polygon barrier.It's also not the longest shooter I've ever encountered. Thankfully Working Designs has included its requisite amount of difficulty levels, which means that even a hardened veteran like myself will be playing for more than a week to beat it on the hardest setting. So if you think you're a pro, and don't want the experience to be gone in a flash, turn the difficulty up a couple of notches. Simple, yet effective.In the end, Thunder Force V is an extremely solid representative of the shooter genre, although it certainly doesn't deliver anything you haven't experienced countless times before. Innovation-wise it gets a below average score, but in terms of enjoyment it's a winner. It's fun, it's furious, and it's highly recommended.", "date": "Nov 14, 1998"}
