Many have tried with varying degrees of success, from IN-FUSIO to Square Enix. Glu Mobile weighs in on the classic genre with the sequel to Alpha Wing. The aptly named Alpha Wing 2 improves on the original in almost every single way, starting from a complete perspective change to infinitely more attractive graphics.   Alpha Wing 2 is viewed from a top-down perspective, which works far better for mobile than the side-scrolling angle seen in Alpha Wing. It extends the playing field, giving the user and the incoming enemies more space to move around. And there is certainly a need for the extra real estate, as Glu has dialed up the action in this sequel. The enemies are larger, they move faster, and they often fill the screen with laser fire.   Before jetting off to the different planets -- each themed like you would expect in any shooter -- you get to choose from three different pilots, each with their own ship and power-up patterns. For example, Robot-X flies the Blue Shark, which fires tight clusters of blue lasers. Tareq's Gecko ship fires a large central weapon with two spinning shots that arc off to the sides. Any of the stages can be completed with any of the ships, but you'll often find that certain firing patterns are better off for specific situations.  For example, Blue Shark's homing missiles are able to target small craft that patrol the outer edge of the screen. Most levels are capped off with boss encounters that fill up a good portion of the screen, and you'll need a fully powered-up fighter to get by these mechanical monsters.   As mentioned, a shortcoming of the mobile shooter is the issue of control. Many phones don't let you hit more than one button at a time, and jamming on a fire button to eliminate a wave of enemy ships is a real pain. Alpha Wing 2's auto-fire is smooth and consistent, and it's synched up with enemy patterns fairly well. The game is hardly a push-over due to the aggressive auto-fire -- you still have to be smart with ship placement.   Alpha Wing 2 looks fantastic. The use of color is excellent -- the game really pops off the screen. The ship sprites are well-sized and the bullets big enough to be easily seen, even when the screen explodes in frantic action. The backdrops are rendered in 3D, giving the overall look some real depth.  Alpha Wing 2 is one of the best mobile shooters I've played and it really shows how far we've come in just a few years. I went back to look at my original review for the first Alpha Wing in 2003. I gave the game a high score, based on what was available then. Tech has grown exponentially, and smart developers are growing with it. Alpha Wing 2 shows that Glu has the goods to stay right in the thick of the fight. And you should support their efforts by downloading this excellent game.", "date": "Jun 8, 2006"}
