It doesn't even attempt to be a true racing simulation, so it doesn't have as many variables and features as some of the other racers on the market.  You can't customize your bike with different tires or gear ratios for example.  But what Redline Racer does offer is an entertaining motorcycle racing game with superb graphics and control.  It's fun, but it's not going to be permanently lodged in your CD-ROM drive.  Initially you can choose from 8 different racing teams, 3 tracks, 3 bikes, and, surprisingly, you can also choose to play as either a male or female rider.  However, as you increase in skill you will be able to race up to 10 tracks on one of 8 bikes.  There are also 5 secret bonus vehicles you can ride.  These range from strange to just plain bizarre.  As this isn't the tips and clues section, I'll let you figure out how to access these high-powered puppies.  You can also choose different difficulty levels and, let me tell you, there is a big difference between easy and medium, and hard is impossible to win with an automatic transmission.  You must master the manual transmission to truly master Redline Racer.  Most of the tracks are hardtop road tracks, but there is also a beach track where you race along the coast on the sand.  Even though road tracks dominate Redline Racer, the tracks encompass 6 different environments, including mountain, desert, and urban settings.  Each race consists of 3 laps with a series of checkpoints that you must pass in a certain time or forfeit the race.     Where Redline Racer really shines is in it's graphics and gameplay.  After playing Redline Racer on both a VooDoo II video card and a card with the Riva 128 chipset, I can tell you that there is a major difference in graphics quality between the two.  Although the game controls were just as smooth under both, the 3DFX landscape graphics were much more realistic and detailed.  Under both chipsets, the terrain looked beautiful, but the bike and rider were a bit blocky even with a 3DFX card.  While riding you can choose from 4 different views, 3 of them are from directly behind the bike (a far-away, kinda-far-away, and right-up-on-my-man's-helmet view) with the fourth being a first-person view.  Redline Racer also does a good job of simulating crashes.  Although your racer doesn't ever die, when you bash into a wall you will go flying (and I do mean flying) off of your bike screaming bloody murder.  Redline Racer offers force feedback for those you who like to get the real feel of a vibrating motorcycle accelerator and supports multiplay allowing up to 8 players to race against each other via serial connection, modem, LAN, or over the Net.  Ubi Soft has also set up a Redline Racer website where players can download new bikes and characters, download software that let's you edit your own bikes and teams, and meet other racers to challenge online.     -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Oct 13, 1998"}
