Keeping in line with the game's amorphous time period that seems to melt elements of Victorian era England with 1940's America, and other elements from throughout the ages, Moby and Oscar have lent their skills to retouching some classic standards of pop.   First up is a reworking of ~Beyond The Sea,~ the Albert Lanry and Charles Trenet penned song translated by Jack Lawrence and perhaps made most famous by Bobby Darrin. Moby and Oscar have created an underwater feeling, muting and burbling the vocals so that they float with languid fluidity from channel to channel. Meanwhile back-masked blips create a sense of ebb and flow, electronically enhanced waves of sound lapping against your ears. Underneath it all is a pulsing synth patter and keyboard tinkles creating a warm, bubbly vibe.    For ~God Bless the Child~ the duo mix up a Billie Holiday number, turning Lady Day's soulful lament into a rippling electronic slice of down-tempo introspection. Steady synth and loping rhythms create the blanket of electronic sound which they wrap ever-so-gently around Holiday's plaintive vocals, creating a darkly haunting expanse of richness. It's gloomy, but in a bittersweetly innocent sort of way. It's like lost spiritual that's been resurrected and is torn between being uplifting and melancholy.   The final entry on this EP is ~Wild Little Sisters,~ which melds floating vocals with sauntering down-tempo rhythms and swirling, mist-styled electronic washes. The middle portion of the track takes echo shifts of what sounds like treated violins--or perhaps it's mutated elements of old jazz recordings, it's hard to tellinto a strangely engrossing breath of synthesized theatrics. The metronomic rhythms keep things static while bits and pieces of catchy synthesized melodies float in and out of the mix.    Enjoyable in a fleeting and often innocuous manner, the three tracks here are gentle, relaxing numbers that unwind in direct contrast to the chaotic and electrifying nature of the game itself. A strangely beguiling contradiction, to be sure. In the end, however, Moby and Oscar The Punk's excursion is too brief and too fleeting to really make any kind of lasting impact. Here's to hoping they decide to collaborate further on some more standards and maybe even think about releasing an entire album of tweaked remixes of songs from yesteryear.
