There's something about this series that makes developers produce really crappy gambling games for SNKs handheld. And it doesn't stop with Neo Cherry Master, Neo Dragon's Wild, and Neo Mystery Bonus. Oh, no...the poor quality casino series continues with a bad Blackjack simulator, Neo 21. Charging full price for a game of 21 is obnoxious enough  but the design of this game is why you shouldn't bother. Features Classic and Casino Mode Dictionary terminology For NeoGeo Pocket Color  Where to begin...Neo 21 tries to accurately simulate a session of Blackjack at the casino. I know blackjack  in fact, it's the only game I play when I hit Vegas or Atlantic City an average of twice a year. Blackjack is a simple game to play with a lot of strategy involved. The dealer deals you and it two cards, one of his is face down. You have to determine, with the cards that are showing for you, if you can get closer to 21 without going over than the dealer. The dealer has rules  specifically, it has to hit on 16 or lower. It also wins if it has 21 on two cards, no matter what hand you have showing. A tie is a ~push~, you neither win nor lose.  The problem with Neo 21 begins with the fact that the game only simulates a single player, dealer versus the player game -- which rarely happens. So the strategy of determining what the odds of the dealer busting is thrown out the window, since you don't have other players' hands to look at.  It's never made clear if this is a one-deck or multiple-deck shoot, so your strategy of determining the dealer's hand is thrown a bit wacky if you're expecting more 10s. And if you bust, the dealer never shows you its face down card. Personally, I need to know if the dealer had the card to beat my hand, regardless if I already lost the hand. Not only this, but you can only bet 5 ~points~ at a time in the standard mode. If I want to bet the whole deal, I should have that option.  The two player link-cable mode is even more of a joke. What this should have been is a two-against-the-dealer game. Instead, one person is the player, the other is the dealer. The ~dealer~ has to hit the A button to hand a card over to the other person. Worse is the fact that the dealer has to play by dealer rules. So, if the player has 18, and you deal 17 for yourself, you can't hit to try and win the hand. And like the one player game, if the player busts, you'll never know what the face down card in your hand was.  To its credit, Neo 21 has clear voice, and a detailed (if cryptic) bookkeeping option that tracks every hand that was played in the game. But even the interface is poor  you can't quit the game and start over without saving the game in progress, turning off the system,  and turning it back on again. Neo 21 employs an auto-save feature, so whenever you simply power down, powering up again will bring you right back to where you left off. There isn't a ~quit game~ option anywhere in Neo21.   I've always said the NeoGeo library has a higher concentration of quality games than the Game Boy Color, but that doesn't mean there aren't a few dogs in the bunch. Dyna keeps cranking out crappy casino games for the handheld, and I think that Neo 21 is probably the worst one yet. Just stay away from all casino games on the NeoGeo Pocket Color, and you're golden.", "date": "Feb 19, 2000"}
