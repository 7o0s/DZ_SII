The game features voiceovers courtesy of the TV program's cast and the program's writer Max Allan Collins also contributed, producing a story which is as sanguine and interesting as the series on the idiot box.Make no bones about it though if you find the TV program a little over the top when it comes to gory morgue action then this game also delivers more than a few unsavoury morsels. That said it is the very graphic nature of the program which has helped endear it to many, so it is logical that the game follows suit. In any case it's probably a good idea to set your food aside while playing this one.The basic gameplay equation is very similar to the original CSI release. There are a number of cases you have to solve and you get to work with the key cast members from the series as you do your best to uncover the grisly truth. If you have played the previous iterations you might find this approach a little too well worn and formulaic, but it still works okay nonetheless.The narrative is for the most part well written and compelling and there are five tales for you to take part in, each with a collection of dubious characters, compelling motives and a few red herrings tossed in to keep the mixture fresh. You won't always know who the real killer is, even though some of the cases lead you so obviously in one direction that it doesn't take much intuition to work out that the killer is somewhere else. The twists in the plot aren't always as surprising as perhaps the developers of the game might have liked.The key cast all do a pretty decent job of keeping their digital alter ego's honest and believable. That said Speedle and your lab lovely Valera sometimes are a little ham fisted when it comes to delivering their lines. The minor players can also be laughable at times as their lines are delivered with all of the sincerity of the thespians cast on Days Of Our Lives.  At least CSI Miami isn't too hard on the eyes. All of the key characters have been created in 3D with some flair. At the same time, the lip synching at times isn't great and there isn't exactly a ton of animation. However fans of the series will feel a degree of familiarity.This game is definitely for a certain crowd. Any CSI game isn't likely to appeal to hardcore RTS or shoot em up fans, as this is really a game with the casual gamer in mind. So perhaps the slightly lower production values and the relative simplicity of the gameplay might not be too much of an issue. Just don't expect more than say fifteen hours of gameplay to complete all of the tasks, less if you have already played a few adventure games.A lot of the 'detective work' really only amounts to scrolling the cursor over the screen until it is highlighted by a hot spot and then cycling through the many detection tools until you get the right one and can collect evidence. The actual details may vary, but this process is one which you'll get very used to. You will be searching for fingerprints, blood trails or other residues, but the process is exactly the same no matter what you find. You simply find a hot spot, using trial and error find the tool which is appropriate, move on to next item of potential evidence and repeat.     The opportunity to interview suspects and engage in dialogue does break this up and you will need to return to the lab to analyze your clues and sometimes even to get a search warrant, but the process of investigative criminology as portrayed here is essentially linear. A higher 'score' is given for your work as a detective depending on how directly you reached your eventual verdict and how often you had to speak to your CSI partner to get clues, but its pretty much impossible to fail as long as you keep on clicking.There are a number of different puzzle types which help keep things fresh. There is stuff like the obvious jigsaw puzzle piece matching (often broken glass) and fingerprint identification as well as code puzzles. To be honest these word challenges don't seem to relate to real CSI work and feel like they don't really belong.The narrative also sometimes moves forward in fits and starts that can be confusing. You may find that you have had conversations which refer to evidence you are yet to collect. It might even be impossible to proceed to the next stage in the investigative process because a seemingly inconsequential piece of evidence hasn't been uncovered or a trite conversation thread hasn't been completed. When this happens the game can really loose its sense of narrative integrity. Yes, it can get back in synch, but it can be a bit annoying.CSI Miami will no doubt please fans of the series, but the truth is that it is the third outing for the same basic game design which first debuted in the original CSI game. It's a little tired. Added to this issue is the fact that CSI Miami isn't perhaps the least engaging of the CSI franchise. The other series have the advantage of a more interesting cast and more inventive writing and the writers don't rely on the swamp and alligators every second show! Indeed, perpetuating this  clich beautifully, the first murder in CSI Miami features this very situation - sheesh!  Also the writing in CSI Miami also might not appeal to everyone. While there isn't much use of bad language it was amusing to discover that by the time the first case was complete we were sure without doubt we had played the videogame which featured the most regular use of the word 'slut' in a short space of time you'd ever find. This isn't really a big deal, but it feels like the writers were too lazy to come up with something wittier. CSI Miami isn't actually a bad game. Indeed my girlfriend, who is also a fan of the series, loved it. However given that we have seen the same formula twice before and the Miami crew are a bit dull this iteration is only likely to appeal to diehards.", "date": "Dec 23, 2004"}
