Chances are good that you didn't  thanks to incredibly limited arcade distribution, the sequel to the cult favorite Virtual On showed up in a whopping two US arcades, while Japanese gamers got it en masse. But thanks to the magic of a little white box called Dreamcast, you can finally take in all the arcade thrills for the fraction of the price of a VOOT cabinet (or a trip to Japan, anyway).  Simply stated, VOOT is a no-holds-barred mech fighting game. There's some storyline involving mega-corporations and other such nonsense, but what we're interested in are the giant robots beating the transistors out of each other. If you've ever craved a game that captures the essence of an intense anime mech duel, this game delivers in spades. Your stable of mecha have been designed by Katohi Hajime (also known as ~the Gundam Guy~), and boast some of the most distinctive robot designs you'll find in a video game. And these aren't the big, clunky 'bots from MechWarrior  all of 'em move impossibly fast, and take the time to perform mocking, human-like taunts at the end of each round.  The action is presented from a behind-the-bot perspective, and your goal is simply to get the other guy in your sights and blast him to Giant Robot Hell. Each mech can attack via their left or right weapons, and firing both at once unleashes a special attack. You can't go too crazy with your offense, as each weapon has to recharge between bursts  and certain moves (like the Dordray's ~Godzilla Mode~) can only be used once per game. For defense, you can do quick dashes left or right to avoid incoming missile fire, or double-jump in the air, which always lines you up with your opponent.  The game's battles take place over a variety of futuristic, multi-layered landscapes. There are occasionally buildings or giant shipping crates scattered about the combat area for cover, and there's usually something interesting going on in the background (the ~ascent corridor~ stage takes place on a moving cargo elevator, with various UFOs flying in the distance).  Of course, the whole shebang is a dead-on port of the Model 3 version. All of the over-the-top special effects of the arcade have come home intact, running at a godly 60fps without a hint of slowdown. Chunks of armor are blown off as the battles progress, and you can even read the insignias on the fronts of the mechs if you're playing on a VGA monitor. While the polygon models and arenas aren't as insanely detailed as Soul Calibur, it still looks right spiffy, and we're not complaining.  The arcade version of VOOT  was unique because of the control layout  you had two joysticks, with two triggers on each stick for weapons and dashing. Pushing up on both sticks makes you walk forward, pushing the left stick up and the right stick down rotates you clockwise, and pulling the sticks apart executes a jump. It just feels like you're piloting a two-ton steel behemoth, and even though there's a bit of a learning curve (along with the danger of sore wrists), it's the only way to play.  Therefore, it goes without saying that you need the Dreamcast twin stick if you really want to enjoy VOOT at home  going without them is like trying to play House of the Dead 2 without the gun, Top Skater without the skateboard controller, or Samba de Amigo without the maracas. We know it costs a good wad of cash to import the sticks (they're physically enormous), but the game isn't worth playing with the stock Dreamcast pad. We can only hope that the twin sticks will be available in the States for when (and if) the title sees a domestic release.  Though the main goal of the game is to battle your way up the robot tier and kick the mighty Tangram's ass in an apocalyptic boss fight, there are plenty of other goodies that reinforce VOOT's standing as a fantastic two-player title. The Versus Mode lets you battle with a friend via a split-screen mode  and best of all, you can customize the aspect ratio of the viewing fields to your liking. If you've invested in a Dreamcast link-up cable, you can connect two machines together for full-screen battles (a costly proposition, but at least the feature's there). Training Mode lets you practice your best mecha-moves on a stationary or moving opponent, and the various Replay and Watch modes allow you to sit back with a beer and observe some robo-carnage. In the options mode, you can turn on Fog Mode (which transforms the game into Turok: Mecha Hunter), or Melee-Only, which locks out all long-range weapons.  What's that? You want to customize your mech? You've got it! The ~Virtuaroid Customize~ screen lets you assign a custom name to each mech, tweak their colors, and even design your own emblem. The game comes complete with a mini-paint program, where you can design a logo to strike fear into the hearts of your competitors.  In Japan, Sega has been hyping VOOT as their first major Internet-playable title. The ~Network Versus~ mode dials a local Japanese KDD server -- not your local ISP, mind you  and lets you hook up with fellow VOOT players for relatively lag-free games. Unfortunately, you can't just plug in a phone line and dial  there's a major catch involved.  Before you can play online, you need to hit your local Sofmap, Yamagiwa Soft,  or Circle K store to buy official Sega ~Web Money.~ Unlike Chu Chu Rocket, VOOT is a pay-for-play title  and since there's no such thing as a free local call within Japan, things start to get expensive mighty fast. We hope Sega won't even consider tacking online charges onto the US release.   Monetary gripes aside, VOOT kicks liberal amounts of ass, and fans of the original Virtual On won't get any sleep for weeks. Be warned, however, that VOOT is a deep game  in some ways, it requires just as much strategy, practice, and forethought as the chess-like pacing of Virtua Fighter 3. I'd suggest that you point your web browser to IGN affiliate www.gamefaqs.com, and read up on some strategy from the Internet's top players. Once you get into it, you may not be able to stop...  -- Colin ~VOOT?  Nah, TOOT!~ Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 15, 1999"}
