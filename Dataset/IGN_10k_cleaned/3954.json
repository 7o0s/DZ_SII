{"name": "NHL Hitz Pro", "name_review": "NHL Hitz Pro", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/24/nhl-hitz-pro", "text": "A couple of months back, Midway Sports announced its intention to ~go pro~ with its new titles. NHL Hitz Pro is the first title to sport (forgive the pun) the new moniker, and it's got a different sensibility about it, as well. The idea behind the Pro line is to give gamers more of what they're looking for in a sports title while retaining what it is that Midway has always done well. That translates into a game that features five-on-five hockey and all of the rules of the NHL, with the on-fire antics, speedy gameplay, and slick action everyone's come to expect from NHL Hitz.  While we were skeptical about the blending of the two (after all, it's like Friend George and Relationship George in the ~Worlds Collide~ episode of ~Seinfeld~), all seems to have worked out for the best. Hitz Pro is exactly what it advertises itself to be. It's the perfect alternative to the more ponderous, sim-style offerings, even though it hangs with them in several key areas. To put it another way, Hitz Pro is fun. Maddeningly so. Addictively so. It's good for both hockey fans and more action-oriented sports gamers. Basically, it's a game that almost anyone can play and enjoy.  Features As we already mentioned, there is a fundamental shift in attitude in NHL Hitz Pro. This, of course, begins with five-on-five hockey. Previously, Hitz was three-on-three, the rink was smaller and there was a much bigger focus on individual superstars. By expanding the ice, and souping up the AI to match, one would think that Midway would normalize themselves with other hockey titles, and get somewhat lost in the shuffle.   But that didn't happen. Instead, the five-on-five format only serves to set Hitz Pro apart. Why? Because the super-speedy, big play nature of the game is intact. Hitz is still at its heart an arcade experience, but now the game is enjoyable when playing with friends (as it's always been), but also a blast to take on solo.  Part of the reason for this is that the game allows you to customize whatever hockey aesthetic you're going for. If you want to play an all-out arcade experience with big hits and fights every five minutes, you can arrange that with tons of sliders and settings. If you want to slow it down and play a more thoughtful, sim-style game, that is available, too. The sim experience doesn't quite match the level of realism of something like ESPN NHL, but the AI is surprisingly good at adapting to whatever you're looking to do.   Another big reason for Hitz' success as a single player game is the multitude of new modes added. Not only is there a cool Hockey School feature, which features the man--Scotty Bowman--dishing on the fastest game on ice, but there is an expanded Franchise Mode and a Pick Up and Play mode as well.  The Pick-up Hockey game replaces some of the old fantasy elements in Hitz: the shark and alien heads and crazy arenas. Pick-up allows players to skate the life fantastic on stages that more accurately reflect the hockey experience--and more specifically, the nostalgic hockey experience. In this mode, teams are made up of local mechanics, packs of kids playing after school, and local bar league ruffians. The arenas are a frozen pond, a municipal rink, and even a street court for roller hockey. Each arena has its own ambient sound, and goal effects, which is a nice touch. Pick-up mode is a fun side-game, and might be some gamers' favorite part of Hitz Pro. However, it would have been nice to take the actual NHL teams into these arenas in civvies and battle it out that way. Next year, perhaps.  The Franchise Mode has also gotten an overhaul. It's not designed like most Franchise Modes around, and that's both a strength and a weakness. The idea is to take an unknown squad and basically ~play into the NHL~ by winning a grueling schedule of games. The teams you can choose from are varied and sport some of the coolest made-up logos and uniforms we've seen. It's definitely fun to scrap and claw and try to get your local boys to graduate into the big leagues.  But there are a few problems with Franchise. First off, if you lose three games in a row, you're immediately eliminated and cannot progress. This may frustrate or frighten off first-time players who can't get by some of their early matches.    But that's not all. There should really be two separate styles of Franchise. While it's cool to try to take an up and coming team and try to put them in the NHL, it would be equally interesting to manage one team that's already a part of the NHL over multiple seasons. First off, it eliminates the qualifying, which might turn some people off. Second, it allows people to play with their own favorite team, rather than trying to force an association with a make-believe squad.    Gameplay We've already talked a bit about how the new five-on-five dynamic opens up the ice, but still allows for the blazing fast game we've all grown accustomed to. What we haven't yet mentioned is the hitting. The game is called Hitz after all, and rightly so. If you're into violence, aggression and humiliation (at least when none of the above are happening to you), this is the hockey game you've been waiting for. There's so much facing going on in this game, it's unbelievable. Guys get checked through glass, dumped over benches and made into board pizza. Victims lose their helmets, and they stay on the ice until a stoppage. Guys get upended. Goalies can even come out and lay some lumber after the whistle. As far as hitting goes, this is most definitely the most explosive game on the market.  A lot of that energy bleeds into the offensive area as well. Shots come off the stick at light speed, and goalies have to make some amazing saves to keep up. As we've said, the game is blistering fast, and can even be cranked up further using the slider bar. This makes for a very wide-open, anything-can-happen kind of game. The action is non-stop, end-to-end, just as NHL was in the Genesis days.   The only knock on this style of play is that goals sometimes seem a little random. A goalie might stop four great attempts, then let a weak one through. There isn't as much satisfaction in goal scoring as there could be. In fact, sometimes it's a little more fulfilling to lay someone out cold with a check than it is to blow one by the keeper, and that's due to the fact that it's hard to feel you'll set it up and really earned it.   That aside, the controls are simple to pick up, and very responsive once you do. In addition to a healthy complement of controls--slap shot, poke checks, dekes and spins--Hitz Pro has added a wraparound shot to its repertoire. This isn't the standard skate around the front of the goal and let fly kind of shot, it's like you'd actually see a wraparound performed in the NHL. By pressing the shoot button while you're behind the goal, your player will actually try to pull the puck around and jam it in the side he's closest to. This adds a whole new dimension to gameplay... and gives roommates yet another way to embarrass each other. In addition, you can take a slap shot on a moving puck, and one-time it on goal. This is another dynamic addition that really adds a lot to the offensive experience.   Playing defense has also been improved quite a bit. Not only can you poke check, but you can dive and block shots, too. There's also a cool system of checks and balances at play in the game. You can poke check, but if a player spins, it won't work. There are several exchanges like this that make the offensive/defensive struggle a game of cat and mouse. In addition, player attributes also play a role. If you're Martin St. Louis and you try to check someone like Jon LeClair, you're probably going to land on your keister. This adds yet another layer of competition. Before you try to lay someone out with a check, you have to consider if it might be better to try to rob them. Touches like this make the one-on-one match-ups a lot of fun.  Fighting has also been tweaked. Instead of a clunky system of punches and jersey pulls, this system works a lot more like musical chairs. When two players square off to fight, a separate diamond of buttons will appear for each guy. Then a cursor will move around the face button icons. The one it stops on is the one you mash, and whoever fills up their meter fastest scores a punch. It's a fun little mini-game within the game, and it's much better than the way fighting was handled in previous iterations of the series.   The on-fire element of Hitz is still alive, but it's a lot less pronounced. In fact, it's so low key it's almost unnecessary and unwanted. While it used to be a highlight of the game to go on fire, in light of all of the improvements, it seems kind of out of place.    Overall, the addition of NHL rules and five-on-five is a good one. The gameplay is still peppy and frantic, while incorporating some of the things hockey fans have been clamoring for in the Hitz series.   Graphics A lot of detail has been paid to making NHL Hitz Pro a more cinematic, engrossing game, and that means cut scenes that tell the story of the game. Whether it's cutting to the jumobotron or watching a replay from multiple angles, Midway has done a nice job of getting you emotionally involved in the action, and much of that can be attributed to the cut scenes. There is a cool blur filter applied to them as well. While it doesn't necessarily convey the feeling of watching the NHL on TV, it does what it's meant to get you into the game. There is one rack focus shot as the players are exiting the bench that's simply gorgeous.      During gameplay, there is also a lot to like. The character models are the best we've seen from the series, even if the faces are a little flat and blurry (and hard to recognize). Their animations are also well done, especially the goalie animations and the checks. The spin move could look a little better, but for the most part, the player movement is nice.  The crowds are also excellent. Fully animated, they show up a lot more than in other games, and also help add to the excitement. These aren't paper cut-outs they are actually rockingdancing and cheering as you play.  The replay system is cool, as it allows you to ~Be the Cameraman~ and grab control of the replay on the fly. The only problem with this is that the game visibly chugs when you take the reins for some reason. It's a minor inconvenience, but framerate hounds will notice. Regular gameplay, for the most part, is silky smooth.  Sound Tim Kitzrow, the voice of Midway Sports for years now, is the biggest reason to love the audio in Hitz Pro. Play-by-play is rapid-fire and keeps up well with the action. The color commentary by Harry Tienowitz is a good addition, and doesn't get too sickeningly repetitive. During load screens, the banter between the two is also quite humorous.  The commentary adds a lot to the ~story~ of the game, as the cut scenes do. Not only do they make detailed comments during replays, but they'll indicate big comebacks, highlight special performances, and generally get you excited (or frustrated) with what's happening on the ice.   The crowd sounds are much more layered in years past, and also much more hockey-educated. Big shots and hits are cheered, oohs and ahhs abound, and the ebb and flow of cheering is spot-on. In addition, the arena music is decent, and well-mixed into the sounds of the crowd. The on-ice sound effects are also decent, if not remarkable.   NHL Hitz Pro is all games to all people. It will not disappoint hockey fans, and it shouldn't disappoint those who love Midway Sports. What it boils down to is an action-packed experience that rekindles memories of old Genesis NHL sessions. Addictively fun as a multiplayer game, and tricked-out with enough new modes and Franchise options to make the single player experience enjoyable, Hitz Pro delivers on its promise.", "date": "Sep 24, 2003"}
