I-play (formerly Digital Bridges) crashes the party with its breezy freestyle motocross racer, Nate Adams Freestyle Motocross, an arcade-y goof that should provide fans of the sport with a few fun thrills.   Nate Adams Freestyle Motocross is not exactly the most realistic depiction of the sport -- and the game is all the better for it. You really only have to worry about the forward and backward balance of your bike, which will help you perform flips and spins, as well as nail landings. Stunts and tricks are mapped to other buttons on the handset. But balance is indeed pivotal, as there are few flat surfaces in Nate Adams Freestyle Motocross. Most of the game courses are bumpy rides, full of jumps and dips that allow you to pull off some fun little moves, which in turn satisfy the requirements of the levels.   One of the keys to Nate Adams Freestyle Motocross' success is that the courses are quite brief. It is easy to enjoy a two-minute game of Nate Adams Freestyle Motocross, pull of a couple tricks, watch some fun crash animations, and then get back to your regularly scheduled life. This kind of easy to devour game play makes Nate Adams Freestyle Motocross a good companion for mobile gamers with very short bursts of free time -- such as minor bus rides.   Each course comes with some small-time requirements, such as getting tot he finish line in a certain amount of time, but between A and B, you need to pull off, say, two back flips. And the course gives you the right elevation to make three attempts. But because the track is so short, repeating until perfection is achieved isn't remotely a chore. In fact, it's a lot of fun, and much of that is credited to the game's laugh-out-loud physics.   That's not meant disparagingly. It's not that the physics are bad -- it's that they are so extreme it's entertaining to watch your rider bounce all over the bike as it rolls over bumps, get flung around during jumps and tricks, and fall arse over teakettle when the inevitable crash happens. The rider moves separately from the bike, which is a very cool trick to watch in motion.   Nate Adams Freestyle Motocross offers shadow races so you can compete with your previous runs. This was a good idea, but it doesn't work as well as it could in practice. The framerate does indeed take a hit during these races -- and for a sport that deserves to look smooth at all times -- this is a distraction.Nate Adams Freestyle Motocross is fun to play -- simple as that. The course sizes are perfect for most mobile sessions and the controls are easy to learn. I found myself actually sometimes directing the rider to come down hard on his chin, just to watch him flop around in a horrible -- but funny -- animated crash. I wish the game was a little more detailed (Nate Adams Freestyle Motocross is pretty austere to be released this far in the cycle), but the core play mechanics are there, so it's pretty easy to overlook that.", "date": "Apr 23, 2005"}
