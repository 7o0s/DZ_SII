Never has one company produced so much endless crap for one system since Head Games' Extreme series on the PC. It's obvious the company doesn't care one bit if its crap stinks up the joint -- one day, Game Boy Color owners are going to stop buying anything with the Majesco brand name, and there will be no one to blame for that but the company itself. Its endless stream of garbage continues with a terrible action/simulation, F-18 Thunder Strike. Enough's enough, Majesco.  It must end here. This far, no further!  Features Arcade or Simulation modes Multiple missions Carrier landings and mid-air refueling Only for Game Boy Color  Of course, to expect an accurate simulation of jetfighter combat on the Game Boy Color would be downright silly. The system can barely push 10 sprites on-screen at once, let alone offer a dynamic 3D perspective. But Majesco went the ambitious route and stuck the gamer in the cockpit of an F-18 Hornet, offering a ~you are there~ viewpoint through the windshield. Hey, it's been done on lesser systems...remember Top Gun on the NES? In fact, Absolute did two horrible games called F-18 Hornet and F-14 Tomcat for the Atari 7800...and correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that Majesco's producer was also responsible for those Atari stinkers back in the day. Dj vu for the Game Boy Color.  The problem with this game is the overall design. There isn't any fun to be had in F-18 Thunder Strike. The whole game can be described and wrapped up in a single paragraph, yet the game itself has one of the thickest Game Boy Color manuals around (second only to Warlocked, a game that's justified in its need for an elaborate booklet). Simply launch off the carrier, fly over a flat, lifeless ocean, and target enemy plane sprites by maneuvering your jet before you run out of fuel. If you've got enough patience to get through the lame ~dogfighting,~ you can land your plane in a basic interface or refuel in midair. Yay.  Controls have been extremely simplified, even in the ~simulation mode.~ You can set the thrust to go slow or fast, and select and fire your offensive and defensive weaponry. Problem is, the controls of your plane are flat-out wrong. It's more like you're controlling the horizon than the actual craft -- if you rotate your plane at a 90 degree angle and pull your nose up, you're actually moving the rotated horizon up and down where you should be pulling your turns tighter. This flaw in the controls actually causes some seriously stupid problems with the dogfighting that makes it near impossible to target your opponents properly sometimes -- move your target in their direction and the enemy sprite skitters away at the same rate. It's really odd and very annoying.  And the interface is downright dumb. To dogfight an individual, you simply go to your grid map and hit the Select button to highlight an enemy blip -- when they're selected, they're magnetized to your craft and they actually get sucked to your location. What the heck's the point of the map if the enemies will come to you when you select them?  Sound, graphics...who cares when the game is this lousy?  Some days I wish I was a fly on the wall at Majesco's boardroom just to see how this company can justify the release of the games it's produced for the Game Boy Color.  I don't think it's a mystery why I haven't seen F-18 Thunder Strike on that many shelves -- at least retailers are catching on to Majesco's scam. It's time for a quick 180 in your business plan. Consider this fair warning, Majesco -- you might be able to get away with crap like this on the 11 year old system...but wait until the bar raises with the Game Boy Advance. Are you ready? I'd say no way.", "date": "Jul 18, 2000"}
