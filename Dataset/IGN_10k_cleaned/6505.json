After all, the name Outpost Kaloki X isn't a name that's easily pronounced or turns heads when mentioned. However, it's an Xbox Live Arcade game that definitely warrants a purchase and download. Not only is it a quirky title with a strange, endearing sense of humor, but it's also got a surprising amount of depth to it and is a lot of fun to play.   So what is Outpost Kaloki X? Remember Outpost Kaloki for the PC? No? Well, it was released in 2004 that's still available as a download for $19.95. With the OKX for the Xbox Live Arcade, you're actually getting more features than the initial release for less money since 800 Microsoft Points translates to $10.00. OKX is a space simulation game where you're tasked with creating a profitable space station by building on additions. As you build new science centers and trading posts to generate income you'll have to constantly make sure you're pulling in enough revenue to pay for power plants and station repairs.   You can play the game several different ways. What you'll probably want to jump into first are the Story modes. The game comes with two, Adventure and War, both of which follow different though silly storylines. It's not the story that's going to pull you along, but rather the objectives. In each of the total 24 missions across both stories you'll have to protect yourself from attacks, reach certain revenue levels, or build a specific number of buildings within a certain time limit. Initially these missions start out as relatively easy, especially in the Adventure story. However, you'll soon find yourself presented with missions that require some precise planning and station management.   Keep these jerks happy. The most surprising feature about OKX is its depth. Each level starts out with a barren space station. From each station extends a certain number of spokes. On each spoke you'll have the option of constructing a building. Some generate power which you need to keep every station running, some generate income which you'll need to complete missions and others house repair droids that keep your structures alive when they start breaking down. If you highlight and click on one of your structures you'll notice a few options for micromanagement. Each structure can be tweaked to generate a more profits or provide more power. The tradeoff is that it'll cost more money to maintain, so you'll need to strike a balance between tweaking and building new structures. Also, the more you tax a power station's output, the faster it will need to be repaired. Repairs in OKX are expensive, so you'll need to be careful how hard you push your contructions. You'll also be able to shut down or sell structures if they're not working out or until you need them again.   Aside from the Story modes, there's also a variety of Scenario modes. In them, you'll try to complete special mission objectives or just do whatever you want with a few sandbox scenarios where you have free reign. Each station has a different number of ports and varied conditions surrounding the station like alien attacks and asteroid barrages. Given that there are over 50 different structures you can build, these modes can be a lot of fun to play and experiment with all the different expansions. You'll also need to keep tabs on what visitors to your station are saying. It's through their comments and demand meters on the right side of the screen that you'll know what to build next. Sometimes they'll even give you access to extra technologies.   Build lots of these. Unlike many of the other Xbox Live Arcade games, OKX does not support play online. It does, however, support leaderboards for the 24 Story missions and a few of its Scenarios. There should also be a number of expansions for Story and Scenario missions becoming available on the Marketplace in the future, ensuring that this game will stick around for a while. There are 12 total Achievements which range from requiring you to beat the Story modes to more specific Scenario goals.   The graphics are simplistic but retain a distinct personality, as do the rudimentary sound effects and swing music soundtrack. While there's no online play, OKX is definitely an entertaining and surprisingly deep experience. For anyone looking for a quirky, unique XBLA experience, it's worth it to shell out the MPs to drop this onto your hard drive.", "date": "Dec 13, 2005"}
