It's when you are not so angry that my interest wanes -- which is forever the problem with any Incredible Hulk video game. When you have so much fun beating, smashing, and shoving with the green goliath, it always feels like such a let-down to slip back into Dr. Banner's white lab coat.   MFORMA's massive Marvel deal continues with the release of Rampage!, an original Hulk adventure for mobile, not based on any movie or tie-in product. Without having to adhere to an external product, MFORMA's designers were free to create a line of action for Hulk that makes sense in the video game universe. This actually goes a long way, and is a prime reason why, say, MFORMA's Ultimate Spider-Man and X-Men Legends II games were much more fun to play than any of the games directly associated with the movies.   As the Hulk, you must bring down The Leader, a terrifying villain that admittedly looks a little goofy, but is a sinister SOB nonetheless. To do so, you must break through military facilities, alleys, and complexes, smashing up enemies that stand in your path. The Hulk has some big moves, like punching an enemy clear across the screen or using him as a club to lay the hurt on the other on-screen foes. The Hulk can also perform some acrobatics that his human form cannot, such as jumping across large gaps.   Dr. Banner handles more of the puzzle elements in Rampage! There are keys, switches, and security systems to be bypassed -- and while the Hulk could just break through any door or obstacle, that's almost besides the point. I'm not sure if there was some sort of mandate to include Bruce Banner sequences, but they are arguably weaker than the Hulk stuff. When you download the Hulk, you want the bull in the china shop simulator.   One of the strongest features in Rampage! is the context-sensitive controls. When you walk up to something you can scale, you simply press walk up and press toward it. I mentioned this in my original preview, and it still stood out to me while playing the final -- context sensitive controls are the best way to do mobile action games. The fewer places you need to position your thumb on your handset, the better.   Another strong feature -- packaging. MFORMA's Hulk game looks great. The sprites are very, very well-drawn and animated. The backgrounds are large, colorful, and are designed for easy path-finding. (Note: I downloaded the game on my Sony 710a via Cingular.) The comic panels that tell the story are also nicely crafted.   Rampage! is a solid action game with quite a bit of game play for fans of the Hulk's beat-'em-up strategy of smashing first and asking questions, well, never. The action slows down when you have to play as Banner, which is by design, but I still didn't exactly care for those sections of the game, no matter what was intended. When I buy the Hulk, I buy the experience of beating the hell out of guards, tanks, helicopters, monsters, etc.The context-sensitive controls are very well implemented. The level design is pretty smart. The art work is great. If you don't think you'll mind the Banner stuff -- the standard grade action-puzzles -- Rampage! could be a good next download.", "date": "Mar 17, 2006"}
