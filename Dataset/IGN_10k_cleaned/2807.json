It's like when you're in college and you have broken down furniture, maybe a crummy old couch, so you drape a sheet over it to make it look better.  But anyone sitting on it can quickly tell it's a crummy couch.  So it is with Legion.  From a distance, it looks like it could be a pretty nifty game about Roman conquest.  But sit down with it and you'll discover a sadly generic strategy game that's only nominally connected to Roman history.   Legion was created by Slitherine, a British game developer, and published jointly by Strategy First and Paradox, the folks responsible for Europa Universalis.  It's a turn-based game played on map where province borders are determined by occupying cities.  The goal of a game is to control 40% of the map and be at least 25% stronger than the next most powerful player.  There are four maps, which can be played from a variety of starting conditions.  Cities are useful almost solely for their ability to create armies and generate resources.  Each city has a population that can be funneled into resource production, spent to raise armies, or left idle to grow the population faster.  Apparently unemployment leads to sex.   The game is very army-centric, which doesn't really do justice to the complexities of Roman history.  If you're looking for something approximating the unique challenges faced by the Roman Empire's various conquests, you won't find it here.  There are four campaigns, but they all play similarly: you swallow up smaller neighboring provinces, which allow you to build more armies, which allows you to swallow more provinces.  Before you know it, oops, you've won.  There's very little sense of facing different types of opponents.  There's no diplomacy or political struggle.  There's no sense of managing an empire.  Instead, you're more like the manager of an army factory.  This is ultimately a game of conquest not terribly different from tired old chestnuts like Empire or Conquest of the New World.   Although you can play different nations, the distinctions among them are minor.  Some nations sport different architecture on the city screen for their structures, but the differences are merely cosmetic.  A Roman shrine is the same as a Celtic shrine, but the former looks like a temple and the latter looks like Stonehenge.  The more important distinction among nations is the different units they can recruit.  The Romans have access to more advanced troops, the Celts get fanatics, and the barbarian tribes usually have to make do with various mobs.  There's a lot of overlap in terms of the units various nations can recruit, but they aren't very distinctive in the first place.  Units are rated by armor, mobility, organization, and morale.  Occasionally they'll have a special ability, such as light cavalry and skirmishers being able to cross rivers and velites being able to cross mountains, but these rarely figure into the game since armies are almost always constructed of a variety of units.     Furthermore, since battles are almost completely non-interactive, it's hard to see how and why battles are won or lost, much less which units are most effective.  The player's role is to simply put his armies on the board and hit the start button.  Before the battle starts, you can give specific orders to hold or advance, but these are useless when you have so little information about the enemy's army.  I have no problem with the limited input once the battle starts; as the manual rightly explains, ~As in ancient times, there is very little you can do to alter the battle's outcome once the armies meet, so enjoy the show.~  But this is no excuse for so often forcing the player to go into a battle almost blindly.  Not only do you not see what types of units you're facing, but you often don't even know where on the map they're starting.  There's no way to use archers as archers (stand back and fire your bows) or cavalry as cavalry (try to flank the enemy line), much less holding units in reserve or trying to take advantage of terrain.  Instead, battles are just two groups of armies rushing into each other in a jumble.  It's like those old football games where you set up your men on a vibrating metal table, turn it on, and watching them shuffle around randomly until someone happens to win.   What did you think of Legion?   One of the oddities of Legion's game mechanics is the way production works.  Each turn represents a season and there are four turns to a year.  However, all construction is completed in the spring.  Whether you're trying to raise a mob of peasants in the summer, recruit German mercenaries in the autumn, or train a half dozen squads of elite legions in the winter, it'll all be completed next spring.  Build a basic lumber mill or an expensive city hall and no matter when construction starts, it'll be done in the spring.  The four-turns-to-a-year also leads to strange issues of scale, such as the fact that it can take ten years to march from the Britain's west coast to its east coast.   The graphics are fixed at 800x600 resolution, which wouldn't be bad if the artwork weren't so generic.  The result looks retro and bland.  When you choose an army, it answers with Latin sound bites that sound as if they were recorded by Father Guido Sarducci.  The interface consists of a handful of big buttons.  On the city screen, you have to spin through your various choices of buildings and armies on a wheel that only shows three at a time.  It's the sort of pointless busy work that has you wondering if the developers hoped you wouldn't notice the game was so dull if they made you noodle around with buttons.  If you're looking for a game about the Roman Empire, there's very little to recommend Legion.  A game like Panzer General does more justice to World War II by demonstrating combined arms, the historical flow of the war with it's progression of scenarios, and a variety of interesting units and game mechanics.  Legion offers no analogous insights into its supposed source material.  If you're looking for an exciting strategy game, there's still very little to recommend Legion.  There's just nothing interesting in the dynamic of a snowballing collection of cities spitting out poorly distinguished armies that you can shunt into non-interactive battles to conquer generic enemies on an irrelevant map.", "date": "Jul 22, 2002"}
