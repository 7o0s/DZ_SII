Not necessarily for the gameplay aspects, but for the fact that my eyes and ears never went a moment without being completely entertained. DOOM 3 is extremely immersive with about as perfect a presentation as I've ever seen in a game. Visually, it has no peer at the moment. Even Far Cry's impressive vistas and wonderful environments can't stand up to the artistic and technical might of this sensory feast. Playing this on a 5.1 surround sound in the dark is an intense experience that, if possible, must be enjoyed.   Without the atmosphere, DOOM 3 is a plain shooter that hearkens back to those of the '90s. Certainly, that's what id was trying to do, and they've done it. While I don't appreciate those types of shooters as much as I used to, it didn't really matter. I was drawn in and addicted almost completely from the moment that nameless marine arrived at Mars City to the moment the final credits began rolling.   The original DOOM, when released in 1993 on DOS, helped to start a wave that swept PC gaming. First-person shooters were still just a twinkle in the gaming industry's eye, and DOOM, while not the first of them, really kicked the genre into high gear. Eleven years later, id has finished developing its remake of the original game, this time with a state-of-the-art graphics engine and a lot of talented people.   It turns out, the first impressions I wrote the other day were not too far off to my final opinions of the game. The shift in opinion was towards the positive however, mainly to do with the increasing level of creepiness, the fact that the art actually kept getting better than it was at the beginning and the pacing was very good. The action was fairly repetitive and AI was not the most impressive (I'll get more into my thoughts about that in a minute), but by the end of the game, I just didn't care. I was having a great time being in that environment while mindlessly blasting mindless creatures.   Video Review Activision kept such a tight lid on Doom 3 that hardly any direct-feed footage has been released. Fortunately, with our in-depth video review and uncut high-res movies, you'll get all you wanted to see and more. So check out Dan Adams' detailed commentary and then immerse yourself in the action with our crisp, 640x480 flicks.  Links :: Video Review | Uncut High-Res ::   The environment in which the game takes place is really the high point here, but it's a very, very high point. Not only is the technology that renders everything in the game amazing, even on low settings, but the actual art is beyond good. The design and art team kicked ass over every part of this game, even managing to throw in an ode to the old box art in an unlikely place.     Everything about DOOM 3 oozes dread. Even if I hadn't known what this game was all about when starting it, I'm pretty sure I would have felt that something was terribly wrong. After the first few emails left in a PDA, that feeling becomes cemented and then it's just a matter of time before the stuff hits the fan.   The choice to make the station on Mars look industrial and depressing was obviously deliberate. This station must have had the highest suicide rate of anywhere in the galaxy outside of Hong Kong. No bright spots cheer the complex web of connecting labs. Tubes, pipes, steam vents, grates, and tons of metal sheeting are the theme. It's oppressive and a testament to the unnatural nature of the events to take place. In some ways the art reminds me a lot of another Hell in space movie called Event Horizon. A lot of the same artistic feel, though the actual movie was terrible.     The base also has a very worn and lived-in feel that adds to the realism. The fact that anyone could live in such a dark place may be hard to believe, but we're talking about Hell on Mars... this isn't necessarily about believability. It's about being able to put the rules of the world aside and enjoy the show and everything id has done here allows that. The detail in every part of the world lets you do just that. Everything from the crisp consoles with bleeping lights and touch screen buttons to the short glimpses of the incredibly detailed outside environments that players get to see on a monorail ride for all of 30 seconds creates a siren song of believability. It's near impossible to resist being drawn into the experience.   The final and probably most important piece is the lighting. The mood wouldn't exist without the excellent placement of the various lights in each of the levels. Flickering lights create strange shadows that will make you startle at nothing. And when those lights actually do flick off and you simply see four glowing sets of eyes hopping towards you in the dark, you'll understand what DOOM 3 is all about.   [One important thing to remember when you're viewing screenshots and movies of this game is that they do not do it justice. There is no comparing getting into the game and beholding it in real-time.]   As we've been noticing more and more as of late, sound plays a more important role in gaming than it used to. DOOM 3 wouldn't be what it is without the help of the sound. It completes the environment in a way that standard bleeps and bloops couldn't. The ambiance is menacing and when you start to hear voices whispering in your ear, suggesting things, warning you... well, it's creepy. Wandering around the base, you're given clues as to what to expect, such as specific sounds letting you know what types of monsters are waiting to eat your face off in the next room.     My only problem with the sound remains some of the weapons. I know that I'll have some people that disagree with me (considering some other IGN editors do) but some of them just don't have the oomph that I need. They may sound like real guns, but that's not necessarily what I want. I want the thump. I want to feel the weight of that gun firing in my ears since I can't feel it in my hands. The pistol, shotgun, and machine gun all had some nice metal clinking sounds that were detailed, but not enough power to make me feel useful. At the same time, the plasma gun felt wonderful and it quickly turned into my favorite weapon, even with the relative slowness of its projectiles.   Finally, on top of both the stunning visuals and near eargasmic sound delivery is the presentation of the story. While the story as a whole left me with unanswered questions after the finale (which I don't want to get into for obvious reasons), the way it was presented was slick. Obviously, as the nameless marine, you won't be hearing yourself speak. So most of the story will be delivered in short cutscenes involving two other characters, short dialogue sequences from the few survivors scattered around the base, TV promotion sequences for the UAC, and PDAs left behind by dead men and women containing both audio files and emails detailing happenings just prior to your arrival on the base.    The story isn't really very complex, but it's presented in a way that you really do feel like you've just been dropped into a really crappy situation with little to no knowledge of what's been happening on the base. You're lost, confused, and a bit freaked out. You weren't a major player in the sequence of things until you picked up a gun and pointed it at your first zombie. It almost seems like the forces of evil are nearly as confused by your reluctance to die as you are by the situation in general.   You'll always feel out of place and confused, but by the end, the sense that you're really and truly alone and in a desperate situation becomes exceedingly pronounced. I can't say that I was ever truly scared on a psychological level (most of the scares are the cheap surprises which were used often), but the creepiness and nervousness of being alone in the dark is good.   Obviously everything in the story has to be taken with a grain of salt. You could ask all kinds of questions about why you're the only marine with the know-how to survive or why Hell decides to spawn only just enough creatures to annoy you without killing you, but that's stupid. You're a one-man army against the forces of Hell. The point is that you win out against all odds. I just wish the final scenes had tied up some loose ends.   It's only when all of these ideas are put together that DOOM 3 becomes the wholly engrossing product that it is. There's a little pamphlet in the box that states the game was intended to be played alone, in the dark, with the sound turned up. It's really true. While the game is still engaging any time, only in the dark with a 5.1 system turned up do you feel Hell really take hold.   I can't be quite as positive about the gameplay. I'm not saying it's bad. It's just not that interesting. I know that id was trying to recreate the same style of gameplay that was so good in the original and in that respect they certainly succeeded. I guess I'm just not quite as into the mindless and repetitive shooting as I used to be. The enemies certainly look good and are animated very well, but once you figure out their tricks and how to beat them, there's not much interest left.      After the first few hours when I wrote my initial thoughts, I was unimpressed with the artificial intelligence of the enemies. I still am, but the later parts of the game wear it better. First off, marine zombies and the elite marine zombies seem to get a little smarter, staying in cover more often than simply running at you. They still don't use group tactics, but maybe that's too much to expect from a brainless beast.   More importantly, the bigger the creatures get, the more menacing they become. Seeing a Hellknight stomp at you in all of his massiveness, you start to freak out. There's a purpose in his walk: to destroy you. That's just something I didn't get from the littler demons that just kinda come at you in a straight line. They all have dodge moves that are agile as can be so why don't they use them more? Take the Imps for instance. I know I saw them crawl up the walls; why don't they do that when they fight you? Crawl up a wall, hurl fireballs, jump to the ground, pounce out of the way of your bullets, etc.    I guess I just wish I had seen the speed and agility of these creatures more, because that was the most interesting part of their combat abilities. Yes, they're Hell's killing machines, but that doesn't mean that they have to be completely mindless. The word Imp actually implies some sort of mischievous and tricky behavior, but they were neither mischievous nor tricky. They usually just stood tossing easily dodged fireballs while being shot. Seems more like a dimp to me.   Regardless of their stupidity, I still had fun running from room to room killing these monsters, I just wish there was more variety to it -- like the escort mission halfway through. Small puzzle solving instances, of which there weren't many, would have been nice as well. Getting past areas by finding PDAs with a new security code got old quick. Aside from that, level design and pacing of the action was great. Enemy placement was sometimes interesting while other times an enemy could spawn right behind or literally on top of you. While that's neat and all, it can really suck when you don't even have the option to respond before being hit. Normally, you can hear where enemies are spawning, but in the middle of a firefight, it's pretty much impossible to hear anything but your gun and the screams of dying demons.   After the single player is done, multiplayer will be giving you a half-evil grin. It's a pretty basic affair here. The limit on play was supposed to be four players, but we've actually seen games ranging up to 16 players. The multiplayer is definitely fun in a basic way, but it probably won't keep players' interest as much as Quake 3 did or Quake 4 will. You've basically got four types of deathmatch options, one with a twist of limited lives and another in a tournament mode where players go at it two at a time with others waiting to play the victor. It's obvious that id created DOOM 3 as a single player game and it's very good at that. It'll keep you interested for a while, but it's not the all encompassing multiplayer experience like we've seen with Quake 3 or Counter-Strike or Battlefield 1942. The real treasure of replayability will most likely sit in the hands of the mod making community.   Finally, grenades are way too bouncy. What's up with that?    I've always thought that presentation was a very important piece in creating a complete gaming experience. I didn't ever think that I'd let gameplay take such a backseat role to presentation when forming an opinion about a game though. The only other game I can really think of that drew me in that far was Homeworld, a game in a completely different genre with its own set of considerations. The fact that this environment is so very purposefully and realistically designed sets DOOM 3 a step above even that classic RTS.The gaming business is all about entertainment, no matter how you get it done. DOOM 3 is an entertaining experience as long as you don't go in with any ideas that this is going to revolutionize first-person shooters. It's a pretty basic game when it comes down to it. Everything works brilliantly, but at its core, DOOM 3 has you running from room to room shooting things without much else in between. I was expecting that kind of gameplay, but I was also would have liked to see AI that was a little more deviously evil than mindlessly evil on at least some of the enemies.That said, it would be impossible for me not to recommend this game to those that don't have a problem battling the minions of hell in a bloody and extremely violent showdown. It's DOOM. And it was worth the wait.", "date": "Aug 6, 2004"}
