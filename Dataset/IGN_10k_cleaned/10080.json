{"name": "Puppy Palace", "name_review": "Puppy Palace Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/02/26/puppy-palace-review", "text": "For the first two minutes or so, everything looks legit. You see a title screen and a playful dog. You're asked to enter your name, and then to enter a name for your new pet shop. Then you'd expect the game to get going  for it to present you with an interactive environment, or a 3D walkthrough of your new store, or any kind of visible representation of your own character at all. It never happens. Puppy Palace has no core gameplay at all.   Puppy Palace is a game that never really begins, as once you've seen the main menu, you've seen pretty much all there is to see. It's confusing at first, as you can navigate around to various options and sub-menus to get a feel for their functionality, but then you'd think that there would be some central hub of gameplay that all of these little selectors and modifiers would radiate out from. The concept behind Puppy Palace is that you're a business owner who's just opened up a new pet shop  but you never visit the pet shop. You never go there. It's just represented by a little icon of a house on one of the game's sub-menus.   Imagine if Super Mario 64 didn't have Peach's Castle, for example  imagine that, instead of having that central hub connecting all of the game's different available experiences, you just chose what next level to play from a menu screen. Seems like an odd idea, right? Well, that's Puppy Palace. A scattering of bits of gameplay with no central foundation to rest on.    So everything ends up resting on the game's main menu screen instead, which offers up three different options  Shop, Pet and Friends. Shop is what you'd think to select to visit the shop, but choosing it instead pulls up a handful of purchasing options for your business. You can buy new products and puppies from wholesalers (yes, the dogs are treated like nothing more than objects here to be bought and sold in bulk), you can take out a bank loan if you're low on cash, and you can remodel your store. Which is pointless, of course, because the remodeling is barely visible anywhere else in the game after you buy it.   You'll see a slight change in the floor texture of your puppies' play area if you choose to remodel, but that's about it  and that change appears over in one of the sub-selections of the Pet Menu. That's where you find the closest thing to core gameplay that Puppy Palace has to offer, as you can interact with the dogs you have ~in stock~ and try to make them more intelligent, more sociable and more hygienic so that potential customers will want to purchase them. But these interactions are extremely limited  you can only throw a ball, pet them by touching them with the stylus, or have them execute four basic tricks like sitting up on their hind legs. That's all. It's about 5% of the functionality and interactivity of Nintendogs.   The dogs are sold automatically, too, to invisible customers as you move back and forth between the menu screens  you just get a text notice that ~four puppies where purchased~ or some such and that's that. You never interact with your customers or get to say goodbye to the dogs you've trained. You never get to push a customer to spend more or invest in extra pet supplies. You never get to open the cash register, or anything else. You don't really do much of anything here.   Friends Menu is hopeless, too, as it simply serves as a way to connect your Puppy Palace experience with another player's Puppy Palace cart  but you'd never find anyone else who also decided to buy this truncated title, so you're wasting your time here.    The most redeeming bit of gameplay to be found anywhere in Puppy Palace is its four incredibly brief and simplistic mini-games, but those will only serve to entertain you for about 30 seconds  one of them is just a question-and-answer multiple choice quiz that tests your knowledge on dog breeds. Not all that exciting.And that's it. You never find anything else, and you never get to do anything else. Puppy Palace ends before it ever feels like it begins. It's almost like this entire game is just the set of extra option menus that were meant to accompany some actual, real, fleshed-out gameplay experience  somebody just forget to include the core gameplay. It looks good, it sound fine and the presentation is perfectly capable, but there just isn't anything to do. It's boring and limited and a waste of your time, so don't put down so much as a security deposit for this empty palace.", "date": "Feb 26, 2008"}
