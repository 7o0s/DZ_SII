Electronic Arts has taken the basic elements of naval strategy and somehow made it fun. With the market becoming flooded with sports sims and polygon fighters, it's nice to see a game like Battle Stations rise to the surface.  After selecting your fleet, you must then lead them to victory against some of the most ruthless Admirals ever to set sail on an ocean. There are three different play modes: Arcade, Campaign and my personal favorite -- the two-player War Games mode. Unlike most naval-sims, the War Games feature allows you to either play with a friend or against a friend. So if you beat the 50 single missions, the multiplayer option allows you to play 26 additional missions with a comrade.  This game offers fast 3D ship-to-ship combat, with each ship being armed with both offensive and defensive weapons. With the ability to launch jets and fire heavy artillery, the Air Craft carrier is a fine mix between offensive power and defensive strength. On the other hand, a submarine can submerge under water and sink the carrier with torpedoes. However, don't get too cocky with the submarine because most of the ships have the ability to drop depth charges. Doh!  Unfortunately, there isn't enough depth to call this game a strategy sim. Although this game is fun in two player mode, the single missions tend to get repetitious and boring. Much like a fighting game, direct one-on-one competition is the only redeeming quality - and that simply isn't enough.  Battle Stations could've been better if they had added a few more options. In fact, EA would've had a winner if they had combined KOEI's PTO Naval sim with a fast-paced Capcom-style fighting game.", "date": "Apr 17, 1997"}
