Since the day Mario 64 was released, the gaming industry has seen more than its fair share of clones, mutations, and hybrids in the genre, though even after all these years, few have matched the quality found in the Miyamoto classic. But is the 3D platforming genre dead? Is there room, still, for innovation? We can't honestly answer these questions, but what we can say is that with enough character, polish and charm, even old ideas can seem virginal at first glance.  That brings us to Voodoo Vince. Developed by Beep Industries and published by Microsoft, Voodoo Vince is a charming platformer that follows the rules of the book, but uses its New Orleans theme to present a game in a fun and somewhat original way.  Gameplay So you're a voodoo doll. You hurt yourself and someone else feels the pain. Get the picture? In Voodoo Vince, players will often be mutilating the lead character (Vince) in the game's puzzles and combat. This premise makes for some humorous and creative situations in the game, and you'll have to start thinking in ways that you normally wouldn't until you get a feel for what Voodoo Vince is trying to offer.  But outside of this voodoo gimmick, Voodoo Vince is very much like any other 3D platformer: there's collecting to be done, there are mini-games to be played, and yes, there are vehicles in the game! But the platforming fun doesn't stop there. Vince's repertoire of moves includes a three-punch combo, a double jump, and the staple in any deserving 3D platformer, a head stomp. If you're tired of this sort of game, you could probably stop reading right now. But if you've still got some double-jumping, head-stomping life in you, or you're in the mood for some decent humor and gameplay, read on.  Voodoo Vince is spread out across roughly 30 levels, each consisting of a large environment with which to explore. Puzzle designs are simplistic in nature, with some of the early ones not even qualifying as ~puzzles.~ The game's structure is linear, which aids in pushing the game's enjoyable narrative forward, though sometimes the gameplay feels a bit forced. Take one of the earliest bosses as an example. You're in a room with a giant dinosaur skeleton that has come to life. Your in-game hint tells you to get a lighting hat and to try and strike the dinosaur with it. What the entire battle comes down to is the player running around, pressing the context sensitive action button at any available spot, and picking up any items, i.e. the hat, along the way. Eventually, the goal is accomplished and the boss beaten, but in a very unsatisfying way.    Of course, things steadily ramp up in quality as the game progresses, but anyone who's played this sort of game should have absolutely no problem working through the game's puzzles at any point. They're all very obvious, and almost feel like they're catered towards a younger crowd. The ambiguous and simplistic combat system and overall easy difficulty only make more clear that this game is set to (hopefully) draw in a younger audience of the big black monolith.  There's nothing really wrong with Voodoo Vince -- the gameplay is tight, it controls well, and the camera is tame for the most part. Yes, there are some cheap hits, some of the level designs are uninspired and almost too conventional, and the combat is a bit weak, but on a whole, Voodoo Vince delivers a fun time. What really comes to the rescue in the game is the (mostly) charismatic characters and likable voodoo theme. Without it, the game would fall in a pit of pure mediocrity, but thankfully it rises above that, though not by leaps and bounds. Easily one of the better the Xbox platformers, Voodoo Vince dishes out a solid, if predictable gaming experience.    Graphics Voodoo Vince isn't necessarily pushing the envelope in the field of cutting-edge graphics, but what it does do is create a solid world that sets the tone of the game in all the right ways; colors are bold, with a emphasis on purple (take that as you will), and the environments are large and spacious, and effectively give off the impression of New Orleans in an obvious, but not overboard way. Character designs range from good (Vince) to generic (just about every enemy), and the animations are well done and humorous.  From a technical standpoint, the game has few faults; the game runs at a solid framerate, textures -- especially Vince's -- are crisp and pleasing, and there is little evidence of broken seams or clipping issues. There are also a number of dandy particle effects to give the game the extra bit of flair it sometimes needs.  Ultimately, though, the question you'll have to ask yourself is, is the art direction something that appeals to you or not. The game has a decidedly American look, which is by no means a bad thing, but strangely enough, some prefer the quirkier designs of the East when it comes to videogames. Either way, Voodoo Vince pulls off what it sets to accomplish visually, and that's saying something.  Sound Like its visuals, Voodoo Vince's sound is solid, admirable, and well-suited for the vibe it tries to create. Jazz licks, Elfman-esque melodies, and accents thicker than 24-inch pythons litter the game's soundtrack, and thankfully, the voice acting is up to par, too. But also like the graphics, the sound doesn't have a universal appeal -- either you'll like it, or you may find it unimpressive in more ways than one. This game's about taste, so you'll have to decide if you're in the mood for something a bit Southern or not.   The Xbox isn't exactly overflowing with quality platformers, so it's good to see someone take the initiative and try to create something new and different. Voodoo Vince is at best a solid, if somewhat formulaic 3D platformer. At its worst, the game is, well, just another run-of-the-mill platformer. The range of quality is relatively consistent, though it never quite reaches the apex it aspires to. Our biggest complaint with the game is that the voodoo theme is not used to its fullest potential. Rather, the game takes many tried and true platforming concepts and simply throws a voodoo skin on top, hoping to fool gamers that Voodoo Vince is in fact something new and innovative. In its favor, the game does pull it off to some degree, and the illusion of a fresh concept sometimes persists, though it can be a bit hazy at times.But looking at the game in the context of what's currently available on the console, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that Voodoo Vince is one of, if not the best 3D platformer on the Xbox. The responsive controls, crisp graphics, admirable sound, and early LucasArts-like humor are only slightly marred by a sometimes iffy camera and linear design. If you're itching for a fun, likeable platformer, then we suggest taking trip to New Orleans and getting your voodoo on.", "date": "Sep 23, 2003"}
