Unfortunately, the game maker's old-school arcade shooter 1942 was enlisted for duty. That's not a slight at the original arcade game, which rightfully swallowed milk money back in 1984. It's just my disappointment with this mobile conversion, an arcade port that lacks the action and thrills that are typically synonymous with the 1942 name.   1942 casts you as the pilot of a P38 Lightning fighter over the Pacific, holding back waves of Japanese planes. Every stage, you launch from an aircraft carrier to dogfight with dozens of kamikaze pilots, but sometimes those dozens are stretched out so thin that you could close your eyes for a couple seconds and still not end up in the drink. Should you ever find yourself cornered by the pilots or cannot get out of the way from a series of slow-moving bullets, you can engage the loop maneuver.   Perhaps what hurts 1942 more than anything is the targeting. You fire in three-shot bursts automatically, so there is always going to be blank moments where you clearly have an enemy in your sights, but you cannot shoot. That is tremendously frustrating, especially when you are trying to wipe out a squadron coming in from the sides of the screen.   The visuals are fine, as they do a solid job recreating the original game. The audio seems off to me, though. The theme that plays during the game sound like garbled whistles and drums.  1942 is just not worth the download -- especially if you are a fan of the original. The game just doesn't feel right, and I even popped in the Capcom Classic disc for the Xbox just to check the original out. Now, I know that mobile cannot 100% recreate an arcade game, but this is one of those ports that just loses a lot in the translation. Pass.", "date": "Mar 7, 2006"}
