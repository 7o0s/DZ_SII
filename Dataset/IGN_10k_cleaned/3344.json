The powerful corporation has been dealt a blow.  No matter which side of this war you are on, you will feel the repercussions of Omni-Tek's arrogance.  When Omni-Tek decided to no longer abide by Tir Accord, which brought some stability to the planet of Rubi-Ka, it opened up a whole can of worms.  The ICC, the ruling trade council, lifted some of the restrictions on Notum Mining, allowing private organizations the ability to mine the valuable resources themselves.  Omni-Tek's monopoly on Notum has come to an end.   Notum Wars, a booster pack for the persistent state world of Anarchy Online, was released recently to the public.  It includes many enhancements to the world of Rubi-Ka, but most notably, it brings about the ability for players to control land, mine Notum and engage in incredible player versus player action.  There are updates to the graphics, a new character creation process, voice commands and a variety of other surprises in this update as well.  Jorgen Tharaldsen, the European Sales Manager, made himself available to me for questions and gave me a tour of many of the new features.   When you first start playing Anarchy Online, you will choose from three sides.  Omni-Tek is the large corporation that, up until now, had sole mining rights to the planet of Rubi-Ka.  The clans, upset with Omni-Tek's treatment of the planet and its people, have rebelled.  You can also choose to not take a side in the war and declare yourself neutral.  Notum Wars takes the division between the three groups even further by allowing Organizations -- groups of players with a common goal who band together -- to control land and mine Notum themselves.  However, it's not a simple task and organizations will always face threats from enemies who want their land.   First, players must find an area of land they can construct a control tower on.  There are many different locations and they are all level restricted, allowing all level groups to have their own slice of land.  There are two ways to obtain towers, buying them outright from a Tower shop or buying the pieces and crafting it yourself.  Some player crafted towers will be better than anything you can buy at the shop.  After putting up the tower, you will need to set up its defenses and choose advantages.  Advantages are interesting because they affect your entire organization, no matter where in the world they are.  They grant bonuses to whichever skills you choose your advantages from to everyone, no matter where in the world you are.  You can also get objects that will add buffs to your group or debuff the enemies during a tower attack.   This is where Notum Wars starts to get really interesting.  Towers can be attacked and control of the land can switch hands.  Even for me, a person who typically hates any kind of Player versus Player action, the concept of defending your land or losing it is appealing.  Perhaps this is because it isn't a 24/7 Player versus Player environment.  Towers can only be attacked a few hours out of the day by opposing factions.  Even more remarkable, during a short period of time, your tower can be attacked by anyone who isn't in your organization, setting up clan versus clan or, even more likely, wars among the neutral players.  You have to buy a shield disabler to even start the attack.  Once a tower has been attacked, all members of the organization who owns it are alerted and they can enter the grid, one of the ways of transportation in Anarchy Online, and go immediately to their tower to defend it.  Side bonuses are given to each member of a faction, be it Omni, clan or neutral, based upon the number of towers that faction controls.  These benefit all members of the faction with extra experience.   There's more to this booster than towers and PvP though.  Voice commands allow players to issue voice instructions with a simple command and they can be hot-keyed.  With the flick of a keystroke, you can instruct party members via voice command to heal you.  The game comes with a default set of voice commands and gives you a few different options for the voice, but you can also record your own commands and share them with your friends.  Several player-made voice packs have already surfaced.   The darkness of night has changed so that it isn't as frustrating to players wandering the wilderness after dusk.  By adding nebulae, planets and stars, the nights are now bright enough to see by.  They've tweaked their dungeon design some, making doors larger and improving pet pathing.  Some of the new dungeons, like the Subway in Old Athens, even have shops inside of them with unique items players can purchase.  In addition, in the wilderness there are often ships flying overhead that if players get lost, they only need to follow a ship to find their way to a city.  New vehicles have been added, including the Manta, a ground combat vehicle, and a new flying Yalmaha that can only be made by crafters and is now the most expensive vehicle in the game.  Also, all vehicles can be customized now with the booster, including painting them new colors.   What did you think of Notum Wars?   With Notum Wars, they've also added a new character creation process to make things easier for new players.  One of the most frustrating things about Anarchy Online has always been its learning curve.  The interface and environment are so new, to even veteran players, that it can take a lot of time to understand what you are really doing.  However, the new character creation process makes things a lot easier.  Before you even enter the game, you can talk to various characters about the different factions and the war.  The chat system is revamped, so you no longer have to walk up to an NPC and type random words trying to find a quest.  Instead, it is now a menu driven system that will give you background information and make it easier to find quests.  Funcom has also improved their volunteer program, Advisors of Rubi-Ka (ARK), making them available for new players as they enter the game.Funcom didnt feel they had enough to call this an expansion, so instead they labeled it a booster pack and released it to the stores.  Many of the new features are available to players regardless whether they have the booster or not, but the land control features are only available to booster owners.  For existing Anarchy Online players, I don't see how you can go wrong adding this to your collection.  For anyone considering the game, it now has a much better new player experience and for only $20, you get the booster and the original game so it's not much of a monetary drain.  There is also a free 7 day trial available.  As for the future of Rubi-Ka, here are some ending words from Jrgen Tharaldsen.  ~One of our 'strategic' goals is to make the players have more of a say, and not the least that the conflict gets a larger purpose.  Not only will it [Shadowlands] feature new playfields, it will change the way you play as well.~  Shadowlands, the aforementioned expansion, is expected to be out in the first half of 2003.", "date": "Dec 19, 2002"}
