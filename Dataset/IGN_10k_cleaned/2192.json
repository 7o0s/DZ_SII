It was the first computer game to get a handle on bringing the D&D pen and paper rules from the tabletop to the desktop and was successful enough to generate a host of sequels (known as the Gold Box series) and a bevy of imitators. And while this latest offering is a little bit of fun, it's hardly a worthy continuation of the series. Poor design decisions and some harsh technical instabilities obscure whatever beauty may lie beneath the experience.  The initial setup is pretty typical, at least by fantasy RPG standards. A Pool of Radiance has appeared in New Phlan and threatens to destroy life as we know it by releasing hordes and hordes of evil, nasty creatures. Your adventuring party is brought to New Phlan to save Myth Drannor from this latest threat.  When you start a new game you get to create your own characters. (You can use the ones that ship with the game but you won't.) This time around you'll only be able to start with four characters instead of six. This doesn't really seem like much of a problem until you realize that the game is heavily combat oriented. Sorcerers and rogues wind up being less useful (and less alive) during the early levels than do your barbarians and paladins.   Rather than rolling your character stats, you're given a pool of point to distribute. This makes all the characters seem sort of average as a result. Naturally if you let people roll their own characters, some folks will take advantage of it and keep rolling till they get characters with at least 15 points in all the stats. This point distribution system is apparently a real feature of the 3rd Edition Rules but it still seems cheap to me. Also cheap is the fact that you can't customize the wardrobe colors for your characters.  Feats and skills are automatically assigned and sometimes make no sense whatsoever. Why a caster should need Toughness before Combat Casting is beyond me. And why a caster can only get up to level 16 seems even more strange. That automatically exclude him from using ninth level spells.  On the plus side, there aren't any more race or class restrictions (except for the fact that gnomes and druids and wizards seem to have disappeared altogether -- I suppose I shouldn't complain as some characters don't even get a choice of gender). There are some really awesome new multiclass rules in the 3rd Edition Rules that really enlarge the options for character growth. Switching from one class to another is really simple as long as you pay close attention to the favored class for each race. Multiclassing with a favored class negates a lot of the experience penalties. The standard D&D alignment system is included in the character creation process but has no discernable effect once you start playing the game.  But, as with the original, roleplaying takes a back seat to combat. Pool of Radiance is a classic series of short dungeon crawls interspersed with some large outdoor fighting. In all, there's a lot of similarity between the fights. It's all handled in a turn-based format but if you wait too long to take an action, you loose your turn and initiative passes to the next character. The level of tactics in the game is generally good but your characters tend to get too bunched up and hamper your efforts to use the already inconvenient interface. The pathfinding sucks overall and many of your characters will take the worst possible route to get where they're going. But given that so many of the monsters are so slow, this might be more of a game balancing ~feature~ than anything.  I'd love to have seen some chances to ambush enemies but it's just not possible here. You're forced into conversations with some of these freaks, most of whom you'd just kill outright. Getting the drop on the enemy then becomes a matter of initiative and not thoughtful tactical preparation. And the fact that you can't cast spells unless you're already in combat leaves ambushes totally out of the question.  You're also unfortunately unable to separate your party by more than a short distance. This makes the usefulness of rangers or rogues a little dubious. Since they can't ever be too far ahead of your party (and because you either control one member or the entire party) you can't really use them to scout ahead for monsters or traps. The map also stays centered on the active character which makes it hard to see where the enemies are sometimes. I frequently went into combat mode without having the slightest idea where the monsters were.  But to make up for the relative ineffectiveness of rangers and rogues, spellcasters don't need to memorize spells. You do have to learn spells but you're only limited to casting a certain number of spells per day. This might be a limitation except that you can pretty much rest anywhere you want almost any time you want. There are certain exceptions to this of course but there are lots of opportunities to rest and recover spells whenever you need to. A small icon lets you know when you'll be able to rest without fear of interruption. This seems like babying to me. I'd much prefer to try to determine when and where I might safely rest on my own. With the current system you just have to wait until the little tent turns green to regain all your hit points and spells. Resting is particularly easy underground since there are no open areas and no day/night cycle to worry about.  Visually, the game is a bit mixed. The backgrounds vary in quality from poor to pretty good. In any case, the overall effect is nice but there's simply not enough variety to keep you interested. Sure, it's a much more local kind of game, centering as it does in the Ruins of Myth Drannor, but the dungeons almost all look exactly alike. Character and monster models are actually okay but they do look a little pixelated. Still, the details and animations on the character models are quality. Cutscenes are almost universally awesome. I had severe problems with the quality of the sound in the game. Both voices and music were harsh and slightly staticy.  A few other technical issues are particularly irritating. For one thing, there seems to be a lot of slowdown. This can make selecting the right options in the character menus a bit of a pain. And since the individual turns time-out after a few seconds, this can get even more frustrating. Random (seemingly) corruption of save files also seemed to crop up for a lot of gamers, but we didn't experience any of those problems. Thankfully I was also spared the horror of uninstalling my game and having all the files on my hard drive deleted as well. It hasn't happened much as far as we can tell but it has happened to some.  I'd like to talk about multiplayer but that's been too buggy to test properly. I do know that the lack of a cooperative campaign mode in multiplayer and the concept of party leadership would tend to limit the fun you could have. Instead there are just random dungeons piled one on top of another.  While there are some bright spots here and there Pool of Radiance seems uninspired and even a little unsure of itself. I'd be willing to give Stormfront and Ubi Soft the benefit of a doubt since the 3rd Edition Rules were released while the game was in production. Still, the rules had been out for over a year by the time the game was done and I would have expected either a better implementation of the rules or at least a more thoughtful departure from them.  -- Steve Butts     Want to share your opinions with the world?
