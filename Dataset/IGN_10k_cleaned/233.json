Gretzky isn't a perfect hockey game, but it's a strong example of a sports title N64.com would like to see more of.  The first and most common theme in the game is its awesome choice of options. With both Simulation and Arcade modes, the game offers the fast, high scoring game that's nearly identical to Atari Games' arcade unit, and a sim mode that follows a stricter version of the professional game as seen on TV. In other words, fewer goals are scored, more rules are enforced, and there is an option for using a larger rink (also available in Arcade Mode). Difficulty settings enable more skilled players to challenge themselves in Sim version on Very Hard, or if you have three friends, you can play two-on-two multiplayer (in a five-on-five game)-- which is probably the coolest aspect of the game. Sim Mode could have been more difficult, and after playing through it a bit, fanatical hockey fans may be disappointed, as there are more realistic and finer tuned hockey games on other systems that easily compete with this one. Another bummer that's quickly noticeable is that the goalies -- all of them -- suck. It's as if they're playing on another level than the other team members. Goals that should never slip in do, and frustration with this aspect of the game can reach extreme highs.  Nonetheless, there's something in here for everyone, and thankfully, the game is able to stretch wide without losing its depth. Fights are great fun, with four actual fighting moves, and the brick goalies, flaming pucks and goalies add to the high-flying attitude.   Sports fans who crave statistical data should have a field day. Stats abound, covering the range from individual to team to season. A Controller Pak is crucial here if you want to keep track of a season, as the game will track your team through the 82-game season, as well as your individual stats. Each player from the NHL and NHLPA is here, and all of their stats are available for perusal, not to mention Gretzky's own stunning career record.  Graphics are smooth and almost without flaw, using the minimum of the hardware's capabilities. Collision detection is nearly spot on, and the physics -- the players' movements on the ice -- are dramatically real. Pucks and players bounce off objects like they would in real life, and players can't rush across the ice in god-like speeds. Overall, the motion capture conversion from Wayne Gretzky's actual movements were skillfully translated into polygonal models, and completed with finesse. Essentially, the game boils down hockey's strongest points, the multiplayercapabilities (being the first N64 game tomake use of the four-player ports), and theArcade Mode. A fine first effort for ahockey title from Midway and Atari Games.", "date": "Dec 6, 1996"}
