Just like football has Kurt Warner and Randy Moss, and basketball has Shaq and Allen Iverson, in the more radical vein of sports, skateboarding has Tony Hawk. What's so great about sports, however, is that there is always room for up and comers. And it looks like Dave Mirra's time has come.   While most of the general public has rightfully glommed onto Activision's Pro Skater series, Activision is still working on its own BMX game, due out sometime in this fall. Acclaim's Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX is not only here and on retail shelves, it's fun to play, and it has that wonderfully irritable quality that keeps you coming back for just one more trick. Or two. Or four. Or, screw it, I'm not going out tonight, I'll just stay in and play Dave Mirra all night.   Gameplay Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX is a fully 3D BMX stunt game that enables gamers to bike just like Mirra along with at least nine other pro bikers, delivering up to 12 locations, a handful of gameplay modes, and numerous challenges that range from amateur to pro to hardcore.   Acclaim has done its homework. It's signed up some major hitters in the BMX arena, including the star-studded cast of the game's lead man, Dave Mirra, but it also stars Ryan Nyquist, Troy McMurray, Mike Laird, Chad Kagy, Tim Mirra, Kenan Harkin, Shaun Butler, Leigh Ramsdell, and Joey Garcia. I believe there are even a few more secret characters in the game, if you can open them up. Each of these guys share the same trick sets, but they also each have their own two special moves, unique to themselves. Mirra has a fricken triple backflip. Sheesh, that's nuts!   Now, if you have played any skateboarding games, then you may be familiar with Thrasher: Skate and Destroy. Dave Mirra fares better than its Thrasher cousin because while it shares the same 3D engine, it's been upgraded, somewhat sped up, and has become more fluid in response time and in animation smoothness. It's not perfect, and in some cases it's quite annoying, but it does the trick, and about 90% of the time it's spot-on. Actually, the funny thing about Dave Mirra is that it plays a lot like a skateboarding game except for that it uses BMX bikes instead.   As for tricks, well, folks, there are plenty to go around. Players can pull off a whopping 1,300 tricks because players can mix link tricks together instantly, using the circle button. For instance, while doing a mid-air 360, you can do a Superman, followed by whatever you want, a No-hander (or a Superman no-hander), or a backflip No-footer, or even a Double Backflip, No-hander, No-footer, followed by a peg grind, that segues into a manual. The manual, introduced in Tony Hawk 2, and totally workable in Dave Mirra, links even more tricks together.   So, when it comes to realism, I can't honestly say how close to reality this game is, but I know that almost everything that's in this can be done in real life. At least that's what Dave Mirra said. In fact, Mirra actually thought up some moves based on the game itself. Not bad. The 3D engine handles most of the moves quite well, especially grinds, moving objects, and changing from horizontal to vertical surfaces, a tricky thing on any system, especially PS. And one especially cool feature enables players to change direction if they get stuck in a corner by double-tapping forward to instantly switch directions.   While the game has its share of great features, the 3D engine still suffers from a few annoying problems. Bails cause slowdown. They aren't as bad as in Thrasher, but they are there, and it's not impressive. It's cool in theory that the skeletal animation system throws down the biker like a wet rag doll that crumbles lifelessly -- with each limb moving independently -- onto any surface. In reality, it's bunk. I don't want to watch it more than twice. I want to get back up on my bike and ride as fast as possible.   Another letdown is the sense of speed. When riding in a straight line there is never a feeling of real speed, whether it's in pools, along jumps, or whatever. In fact, sometimes, actual moves are pulled off incredibly slowly, as if in slow replay motion. They just don't seem realistic, even to the non-BMX guy. Likewise, your biker achieves angles and tricks that just don't seem right -- at any speed. And I'm not talking about the freedom of arcade-style gameplay, I'm saying that when I'm going 2 miles per hour and am at a 45 degree-plus angle, I should bite it.   Last, Acclaim has tried to alter the jump maneuver that was executed perfectly in Neversoft's engine. Instead of holding X to jump when you roll up a ramp, you hold it for a shorter period of time, and release it right before the jump. The difference is subtle, but it's different enough to have any Tony Hawk player swearing up and down. To be fair, it works fine and it's not a bad system, but Neversoft nailed the X jump perfectly the first time around, and in my eyes, there isn't any reason to change it al all. It's as if someone said to use the Triangle button for shooting or action, instead of the X button. You'd just look at them and say, ~But why? X is the fire button,~ and then you'd bitch slap them. End of story.  Structured with many different kinds of players in mind, Mirra's front end is relatively speedy, easy to use, and provides a good choice of play modes, including Proquest, Session, Freeride, 2-player, an option section, and a neat little offering called Cool Stuff, which is made up of challenges, high scores, movies, and credits. The Proquest is the core of the game, from which almost all of the extras and secrets are generated. It's essentially a Career mode, complete with objectives to open up new parks, bikes, sponsorships (and therefore clothes, shoes, helmets), and several levels of difficulty, Amateur, Pro, and Hardcore.   What's nice is that the game structure is linear even though the courses aren't. Players begin the game in Greenville, and as they progress by achieving different objectives, they open up new levels, including subsections of the same location, and whole new locations. The game highlights Greenville's Vail Trails, a Park, and the Pools; Woodward, its Trails, the famous Lot 8, and the Titanic, plus at least six more. The farther you go into the game, the more complex the locations and the harder the challenges.   Now, being a big fan of Activision's skateboarding game, I can't shake the idea that even a BMX game must somehow be compared to Tony Hawk. Pretty much everyone else is thinking the same way. The question that everyone has asked me: ~Is it like Tony Hawk? Does it play better than Mat Hoffman?~ Since I'm a fan of radical sport games, not just the specific companies that make them, I can honestly answer that Dave Mirra is a fun, long-lasting game that keeps pulling me in to perform better tricks, longer combos, and to keep unlocking new challenges, bikes, and locations. And I personally could give a sh%t about BMX. My bag is skateboarding, snowboarding, and surfing games. But if a game keeps drawing me in, it's got to be good, and Dave Mirra does just that. In short, despite some little annoyance, it's a blast, and well worth its weight in salt, bits, sprockets, scooties, or what-have-you.   Graphics Dave Mirra boasts a few graphic niceties. With a broad color palette, the levels all have a unique look and appear different in textures, subtleties and feel. The textures are actually quite good in the backgrounds, with lots of organic foliage and structures appearing lifelike. Any one of the riders change in appearance once they earn a new sponsor and you manually change their outfits. And the replay sequences are quite cool, because the camera switches often enough, and the camera work includes fades, and in some cases perfectly choreographs shots of your rider pulling off especially cool moves. In all, the graphics are solid, and there is little argument here.   Sound One of the first things a noticed about Dave Mirra is that the sound effects and the music are both of the highest level. Gamers will immediately notice the sounds of peg grinds, spinning bike chains, and a small library of other sounds. The sound effects are right on.   As for music, the game is sweetness to my ears. I still listen to too much Led Zeppelin and Elvis Costello, but I loved the bands in Dave Mirra. They just felt right on. The list of songs in so refreshing from the kind of crappy (and no offense Rob Zombie fans) overkill Rob Zombie tracks that was shoved down our throats a year ago, it's hard to know exactly what happened. All I can say is that my ears are happier (can my ears be happy?). Anyway, the list is like a top-10 roster of great current bands that includes Cypress Hill, Deftones, Sublime, Primer 55, Social Distortion, Rancid, Pennywise, Dropkick Murphys, 59 Times the Pain, and Swinin' Utters. The song lineup may not be your cupt of tea independent of the game, but within the game, it smokes. Like most gamers, I have an infinite love affair with the Neversoft 3D engine, and it's not by mistake. It's the best 3D engine out there for games of this nature. Dave Mirra, however, despite an inferior engine, is a highly addictive game that has what it takes to keep gamers playing for long hours into the night. Right now, Acclaim has taken the opportunity to get its game to market first, and so it's the first BMX game for PS, and it's worth buying, but not only for that reason. The single player game is fun, and so is the two-player mode, with all of its various minigames. But it's the game's structure, which constantly challenges you to pull off more combos and better tricks that puts this in the must-have category. It's got great depth. I suppose that in the end what really got me going is that I now like BMX riding a lot more than I ever did. I'm looking forward to opening up the rest of the secrets in Dave Mirra, even though I have a huge stack of games lined up to play for the next four weeks. Take that for what you will.", "date": "Sep 21, 2000"}
