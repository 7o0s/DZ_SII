Unlike nearly any other strategy game I've played, the tutorial mode takes hours to get through. That's not an exaggeration; the eight different lessons that ease players into the insanely deep mechanics of the game take, at the very least, a couple of hours investment if you hope to wrangle the game's sprawling labyrinth of menus and options under control.   The rewards are numerous, mind you, but I can't think of a better way for a game to weed out those that haven't the attention span for the rest of KOEI's arduous mix of policy, political gerrymandering and militaristic planning. Let me be absolutely clear here: this is a strategy game for strategy die-hards, the kinds of people that live for plowing through menus and painstakingly constructing an empire from the most modest of beginnings. It will bore to tears most of the jump cut-addled, MTV-watching, Ritalin-popping masses due to a sometimes excruciatingly slow pace.    This is the most exciting thing you will see for the next six hours. Again, though, if you can stomach that, there are few games that give you this level of control over every single friggin' aspect of your rise to conquer a rather large hunk of the world's biggest continent. All the minutiae that comes with running a country plays out here -- even when starting off with whatever Chinese warlord, general or simple countryman you choose. You'll build armies on a troop-by-troop level (not individually, mind you, but at least per-unit-type), learn how to handle exchanges with foreign dignitaries and broker deals with heads of state for both war and peace, participate in debates and duels and of course, go to war.    The battles are one of the key areas where KOEI decided to upgrade the series a little. In addition to having the main screens presented in 3D for the first time (complete with some fantastic looking cel-shaded models), nearly everything takes place from a universal overhead map broken down into grids. Rather than pulling out of territorial management to go into fights (save for duels, but more on those in a second), you can issue attack orders and guide your units around from the same screen where you'll develop your assorted territories. This helps you shunt the various units and resources between your cities relatively easily, which is key because though there is a basic rock/paper/scissors setup to army units, overwhelming numbers are almost always the best way to proceed.    Seasons of love. And war. Not only does this keep you in the action, but it helps to streamline the turns a little. Sure, you'll still have to plow through a dozen menus or so in pre- and post-prep for whatever's coming next, but the grid view keeps things in sight and mind. It can be a little overwhelming once you've built up multiple cities and are deploying multiple forces -- especially because some of the games 20+ scenarios will eventually having you juggling things on simultaneous fronts. The rewards, though, are a rush and sense of accomplishment that few games can deliver, mainly because you'll likely have sunk double-digit hours into just a single scenario (in fact, none of the ones I played were finished in less than ten hours).    Duels are one of the few times when you'll drill down enough to decide things in a relatively real-time fashion. Yes, there are negotiations and debates and bits of diplomacy to deal with, but Duels let you take up to 50 turns to whittle down an enemy general's health by picking from a handful of attack and defensive moves that play out something like a blind rock/paper/scissors match. Build up enough Spirit from attacks and you can inflict far more damage, though some of the attacks require that you have a proper weapon.    Overwhelmingly, though, your time with Romance XI will be spent diving in and out of menus to enact all of your micromanagement. That wouldn't be so horrible since this is a strategy game, but some of the interface can often be cumbersome, with some data falling into redundant territory. It's nothing that a few hours and some trial and error can't solve, but it's definitely yet another impediment to newcomers.In all honestly, this isn't a game for newcomers anyway. Despite surviving for more than 10 games, the barrier to entry for the series is far higher than perhaps anything else on the PlayStation 2. That doesn't negate any of the rewards for actually sticking it out and surviving the grueling process or building up armies and managing resources like a true armchair general, but to get that sense of accomplishment, you'll have to endure an almost relentless level of tedium. If you have that kind of patience, by all means give the game a shot, but only if you have that kind of patience.", "date": "Feb 8, 2008"}
