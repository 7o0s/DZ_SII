Seemingly directed at both dedicated and forgiving role-playing fans at the same time, the franchise has definitely seen its ups and downs. Probably at its height in the original Game Boy handheld days (released in North America as Final Fantasy Legend), SaGa hasn't found the audience it's been looking for in years. And with the last two installments receiving less than stellar reviews on both sides of the Pacific, the expectations for the next version grow smaller and smaller with every passing suggestion. Truthfully, we should just face the facts: Akitoshi Kawazu (Director/Producer) is going to make the game that he wants to make regardless of what everyone else thinks --and the world be damned if nobody likes it.Keeping that truth in mind, Square Enix has presented the latest title to carry the SaGa lineage, UNLIMITED SaGa. And though it has plenty of fresh ideas and old school merits that bring back a couple of memories from the 8 and 16-bit eras, they're not necessarily good ones. In fact, UNLIMITED SaGa manages to present itself as a rarity in today's market of ultimate accessibility: it's brilliant, open, and focused in some aspects but completely dense, restricted, and incomplete in others. To put it overtly, it makes for quite a confusing experience.StoryTo clarify, it's not the plotline that's really so confusing, but rather the gameplay that's used to tell it. Building a tale around ~The Seven Wonders of the World~, UNLIMITED SaGa's backbone isn't so bad by most RPG aficionado standards. And after a few hours of absorbing enough details to realize that the wonders contain powers of ancient gold-like beings and that evildoers are out to exploit them, the pace of the story really begins to pick-up. It's just waiting for those moments without frustration that will be trick.  Adding a healthy amount of replay and the always popular ~different point of view~, SaGa also includes the option to play as seven different characters from the game's outset. With seven different tales that are philosophically different and entirely self-contained (with character types obviously aimed at individual user's personalities), each main hero has an individual set of supporting characters and adversaries before meeting up with one another at a large festival gathering deep within the game. Ranging from an ex-pirate known as Laura and a genius inventor called Mythe to a teenage fortuneteller named Ruby, the characters are fleshed out rather well and definitely offer an eclectic mix of familiar and not-so familiar RPG  clichs and approaches.GameplayAnd here we arrive at UNLIMITED SaGa's most interesting tidbit, it's gameplay system. Touted by Square Enix in its own advertising campaign as an RPG for the hardcore market, SaGa already comes to the table with an obvious warning for casual gamers -- you have to be committed from the beginning if you're going to enjoy this one. Granted, saying that the statement is true could be the most obvious comment in the history of videogame journalism, but it's an undeniable certainty that 99% of the mainstream out there probably won't like it one bit.The most obvious reason for disdain could be the total lack of exploration of the world and its areas. Rather than allowing the player to take their team out on a quest to find new sections and run into random creatures, gamers are instead treated to a prettied-up grid-like interface that allows them to move in limited directions. In one example, a party may start from the confines of a town and are presented with question markers in several directions. Moving the right analog stick towards the question marker also moves the party to the next grid, and the process is then repeated from the new position. Regardless of which character you're adventuring with or what section of the world you happen to inhabit, this is the same process used for traveling for the entire experience.    Further complicating things is what happens to you once you're on a new grid. Depending on the special skills or attributes of your characters, players may or may not detect traps, monsters, treasures, or all three. Each square is different and despite not being randomized for every new game, does a great job of appearing that way. Anyhow, once the player is on a square with possible action points, several things can happen: An enemy will either attack them and thrust them into battle mode or they'll be able to select what type of action they'd like to perform for that turn (investigate the square, open a treasure, or perform a preemptive strike on the monster). It's also possible that the square might contain a trap of some kind (spikes, pitfalls, and the like) with the only way of avoiding it being to successfully hit the right icon on a rotating slot.Slots (or reels as they're known in the game) play an important role in several aspects of UNLIMITED SaGa actually, and whether you're avoiding a trap or participating in battle, honing your skills properly is key to finishing your opponents quickly and concisely. Given five commands per round regardless of how many party members you have, players will have plenty of chances to bring the hurt on at any given time. Of course, the real challenge is figuring out what attacks will be successfully against your opponent or whether or not you should ~hold~ onto your aggression (re: a buffer command that allows you to skip one or more of your five attacks per round) in order to create linked or chained moves. Success still depends on the proper manipulation of the slot wheel, and once the more advanced techniques are exposed there's just as much difficulty in determining what attack to use as there is in beating the enemy itself. The system isn't going to please everyone, and will probably serve as the biggest point of debate amongst its fans.There are other interesting segments of UNLIMITED SaGa that are sure to create arguments as well. Town navigation, for instance, is limited to clicking on names of buildings from within a photograph and buying items or weapons can become confusing as to whether or not your new equipment is an improvement (that's bad). On the other hand, U-SaGa also allows you to collect ingredients for making your own weapons and armor at each town's blacksmith in order to grab things you normally can't buy, and healing yourself on the world map is as easy as pressing L3 or R3 on the Dual Shock (that's good). It seems to be a recurring theme in UNLIMITED SaGa, as for every cool aspect (customizable level gains), there's something that holds it back (the interface is confusing as hell with little documentation).  For those of you who decide to stick with it though, you're looking at more than 100 hours of gameplay and adventure. With seven different main characters and quests for each of them expounding beyond the requirements of more recent RPGs like .hack and Dragon Quarter, it's conceivable that most of us will never find everything that there is to do. Not to mention that the sheer difficulty of the latter enemies and non-linear nature of each quest and its multiple scenarios make that possibility even more likely. Which is why we liked to hop back to the menu screen and watch the included ten-minute Final Fantasy X-2 trailer in between beatings; it helped to clear our minds for the inevitable ass-whooping to come.GraphicsIn the still photographs UNLIMITED SaGa looks magnificent. Sporting designs and illustrations by the respected Yusuke Naora (Final Fantasy X) and Tomomo Kobatashi (SaGa Frontier 2), the game's visuals are a stylized mixture of scenic landscape paintings and traditional two-dimensional RPG artwork. We could easily go on record by saying that UNLIMITED SaGa is among the most beautiful-looking PlayStation 2 games on record; but of course, it would come with a single, distinguishable caveat: only if it's paused.    Once in motion the character animation is almost completely non-existent, with only minimal use of movement for humanoids, beasts, insects, and whatever else happens to be floating onscreen at the time. Magical spells and special attacks are more eventful, and some of the more powerful attacks are actually pretty cool to look at. But the aforementioned lack of animation and a distinct absence of variety in the over world ends up holding the game back more than it should.SoundUNLIMITED SaGa's most valuable asset, could be its excellent audio. The first Square Enix title to incorporate Dolby Pro Logic II, sound effects, voices, and music are all incredibly rich in both quality and positioning. Granted, the auditory effects are a little on the bland side but its convincing presentation is enough to warrant a few extra mentions. Ditto for the Saturday morning cartoon-inspired voices.The soundtrack, however, is another story entirely. Successfully mixing several different versions of the same collection of themes, the orchestral combination pieced together by composer Masashi Hamauzu is probably the best in the franchise so far. Utilizing a wide range of themes that travel the scales from light-hearted and peppy to depressed and foreboding, the score overshadows all other aspects that U-SaGa has to offer. It's a shame that the rest of the game didn't live up to its standards.Square Enix's departure from its usual Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest fare isn't for everybody. It's not easily accessible and its shortcomings may overshadow some of its stronger qualities (like the excellent soundtrack, character development bits, and innovative battle features). In fact, nobody should be surprised when it fails to sell well in the domestic market, and should be even less shocked when it pops up on eBay in a couple of years for twice its original price (gotta love those quirky niche collectors!).Should the proper set of folk that remember what game the Gomutai Sword is from decide to skip over their ninth trip to Mount Koya in order to give this one a try, however, (a special mention to anyone who can identify the two games I'm referring to) there's still a strong and unfortunate chance that you'll end up disappointed. Whether it's the clunky navigational setup, a bothersome interface, or the overly complicated battle system, UNLIMITED SaGa may still be a bit too hardcore for its own good.One thing that I should mention before I go, however, is that I personally believe that the SaGa team is one of the more creative collections of videogame guys out there. They're always full of new and interesting ideas that are meant to take the RPG genre in a twisted and different direction, and take chances that other teams won't always take. While their track record may be a bit spotty in terms of high quality entertainment, I firmly insist that the team has a mind-blowing effort in them just waiting to be exposed. Whether or not that game turns out to be the squad's next project, Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles for Nintendo GameCube still remains to be seen. But the important thing to remember is, that it's only a matter of time.", "date": "Jun 10, 2003"}
