For those of you not in the know, Cabela's hunting games are more simulation than action, with an emphasis on stealth and item usage. This version tightens up the core gameplay from Cabela's other hunting excursions and adds some much needed polish. And I was pleasantly surprised by what is probably the best overall hunting game on a console to date.   One of the most obvious reasons for this, is that Deer Hunt 2004 offers a ~Quick Hunt~ option that allows you to jump into any location without worrying about resources like cash. This is a good way to get used to the rules and regulations of the hunting areas. For example, I quickly learned about what the game deems ~unethical hunting behavior.~ Apparently, chasing down deer in an SUV is not considered to be an acceptable hunting method. A couple of other regulations include hunting out-of-season animals and firing weapons too close to somebody's lodge. After a warning from the Game Warden, players will be fined a big chunk of cash for their misbehavior.   After tooling around in Quick Hunt, gamers will want to start up a career. They can begin by choosing a difficulty setting of easy, medium, or hard, and if they've ever played a Cabela game before, then it's best to start on the easiest setting. On medium and hard, simply finding an animal can prove difficult while lures and calls are sporadically effective. The most important thing to remember about Deer Hunter is that animals are aware of every twig you snap, and your most valuable assets are a good riflescope and some patience. The easy setting acclimates gamers to this style of game play with a high frequency of animals and a red dot on the screen known as the ~Trophy Beacon.~ This marks the location of every game animal on the map. Armed with the knowledge of animal locations, gamers are able to practice their approach to unsuspecting deer and figure out how cautious they need to be while moving in for the kill.     Click For More Images Character selection includes a choice of three different men and two different women. Each of them belongs to a different age group (teenage, mid 40's, and mid 60's) and has their own strengths pertaining to stealth, aim, and endurance. Basing the hunter's strengths on age groups makes sense, sure -- but there's something humorous about choosing ~mid 40's male,~ as a profile. Each character has five different ~faces,~ which are really just variations on facial hair and hat styles. Playing through the game also unlocks a few bonus characters with enhanced attributes in certain areas.     I've already stated that this is a hunting sim, not an FPS starring woodland creatures. Make too much noise while running through the brush and your prey will bolt. Approach your target from upwind, and it will bolt. Move too quickly in view of an animal and, you guessed it, it will bolt. Without stealth, you might as well be playing a hiking simulator. Unfortunately the numerous factors that contribute to stealth have a very little effect on the stealth meter. The small red bar in the upper right hand corner of the screen only seems to react to whether or not a player is moving or crouching. Walking over brush instead of dirt will most likely scare away any deer in the area with decent hearing but you'd never know this from watching the meter. However, after a couple of levels players are able to gauge how noticeable they are to animals by judging their reaction. Then you can forget all about the silly red bar.    Other onscreen indicators include a health meter in the shape of a hunter. When meter is depleted hunters are transported back to the lodge for medical attention. This will clear all progress in the level and cost a small fee. Health is affected by four sub meters, which include condition, nutrition, hydration, and stamina. Each area can be maintained through the use of appropriate camping accessories and intelligent hunting practices. Hint: hunters in this game cannot swim or fly. Mind the terrain or you will win yourself a quick trip back to the lodge. The small flag on the top right of the screen is a wind indicator that allows you to plan your approach. There is also an ammo counter and the ammo is unlimited, but reloading can take awhile depending on the weapon.    Luckily there are two ways to go about filling the tag quota for each animal. Players can either track deer through the wilderness or set up a stand and wait for the animals to come to them. Waiting in one spot for an animal to wander by is more complicated than it sounds. Items such as scent cover, decoys, and deer feeders really come into play. Personally I preferred more proactive hunting methods and spent most of my time tracking deer. There is an automatic tracking system that scans the area for signs of deer passage with the push of a button. This will point you in the right direction and can be very useful when combined with a decent knowledge of the map screen.     As far as the visuals are concerned, there are both good and bad aspects to them. On the positive side, these are by far the best environments in the series so far. And there are enough variations in terrain and plant life that each hunting location has its own distinct feel. There are weather effects like rain and snow too, and the tall grass and fauna blow around in the wind. Small details like falling leaves, smaller woodland creatures, and flocks of birds add to the feeling of being in the great outdoors.    The most noticeable downside to the visuals, however, is the significant amount of draw-in to the underbrush. There is no noticeable popup pertaining to other objects such as mountains, trees, and animals. This can lead to awkward situations where an animal is visible at a distance without a scope or binoculars, but is obstructed by the brush once these items are put to use. When traveling by a vehicle, there is a strange bit plant life growing at an incredible rate as the hunter approaches it. This can be distracting, but doesn't detract from the gameplay enough to hurt it too bad. Hopefully the environments will continue to steadily improve with each new version of Deer Hunt..   And since we're on the subject of presentation, how about that sound? The series already has a strong pedigree in this regard, after all, and Dear Hunt 2004 is no exception. Throw in the fact that it supports Dolby Digital, and you have the best audio yet.  Unfortunately, the goofy metal riffs that play behind the menu screens may put some people off. But the sound is still most effective in its restrained portrayal of the outdoor environments. Your footsteps sound different depending on what type of terrain you walk over, wind rustles, and brooks gurgle. Weapons effects and the small amount of dialogue are also decent.Cabelas Deer Hunt: 2004 Season forces players to carefully plan for and carry out each expedition. The game play is hardly action packed, but it is immensely satisfying once you are finally able to pull off a clean shot at a trophy buck. The slow pacing may seriously put off trigger-happy gamers with short attention spans, while those not interested in using items such as scent cover or ground blinds, are going to want to rent this before buying. However, with a little patience I believe that most people who stick with Deer Hunter will appreciate the deep game play involved in sneaking up on, and bagging an animal.", "date": "Aug 26, 2003"}
