Mostly because I really did hate it because of one stupid level that hurt my ego and crushed my spirit. I'm really not sure what it was that finally got me over the hump and allowed me to have fun, but it eventually happened. I guess games like this one give me some more appreciation for the fact that I'm required to push my way through the pain and get to know a game better than simple first impressions. There's still an amount of frustration with Nemesis of the Roman Empire that I just can't get over, but the core of this game certainly isn't rotten. There are actually some pretty good mechanics at work here to create a game that forces quick thinking and immediate reaction. It's a good game that needs a bit of help to become a great game.   Nemesis of the Roman Empire is actually a follow up to Celtic Kings: Rage of War released in 2002. It actually seems more like an expansion pack than a true sequel considering the engine seems not to have improved and many of the same units return. The main difference is the inclusion of new sides to the battle along with their new units. The ~nemesis~ that the title so speaks of is Carthage. If you're up on classical history at all, you'll know that Carthage was one of the only powers to really stand up and challenge Roman dominance thanks to a talented general named Hannibal.   Without a doubt, there is a lot of content to be found in Nemesis of the Roman Empire. Multiplayer, skirmish, and adventure mode are all available and will provide plenty of play hours for those that purchase the game.   Those RTS fans unfamiliar with the series will find an experience different from many titles out on the market. Nemesis of the Roman Empire and its predecessors take a different approach through their resource and unit systems. Gamers can put away the hammer and nails because construction of bases doesn't play a part in this game. The only buildings you'll find in the game are pre-made and indestructible structures. Sides usually begin with a stronghold surrounded by buildings such as barracks for training of units, blacksmiths for upgrading units, temples for upgrading spell casters, and arenas for hiring and upgrading heroes. Scattered forts, training halls, markets, and villages fill out the rest of the maps. While the stronghold is the main objective for most multiplayer and skirmish games, those buildings in between are what will be fought over.     Each of these buildings has a significant value. For instance, villages are probably the most important commodity in the game. They are your entire food production in the game. Food is an invaluable resource. Each unit on the field, including heroes, has to have rations to survive on. Once they run out of food, they begin starving. Having enough food to keep your units healthy with is an absolute necessity. Therefore, taking away the enemy's opportunity to collect rations is also imperative. Forts, on the other hand, provide a safe place for wounded troops to sit and heal up (given that the fort has been provided with enough food) before getting back out into the fray as well as acting as a bank (earning interest) after 2000 gold sits there. Gold is what you need to buy new troops and heroes. These buildings are also important. You get the picture...   Capturing these buildings is obviously a priority and there are a few of them around. This one mechanic keeps the pace quick. You'll have to move your troops out to engage in battle and take these buildings from your opponent. There is no choice. You can't sit behind defenses and wait for your enemy to run out of resources after breaking himself upon your walls. Even sitting inside of forts can make you vulnerable. Any unit on the field, minus hero units, can be used to create stationary catapults with which to bombard forts and stronghold walls in order to knock out defenses. Armies will have to move out of the fort to defend territory. Almost every feature in the game is designed to keep the pace of the game up and battles raging. It's quite welcome in a genre that often promotes something akin to laziness and/or fear in gamers.    One of the selling points of Nemesis is without a doubt the number of units that can be on a map at the same time. In large games you can see thousands of units. In order to keep things organized, each of these units can be attached to a hero unit that gains experience that rubs off onto any units attached to it. Units with higher experience change color. Once attached to a hero, units can be placed into one of three formations for different situations.    Unfortunately, I couldn't find a way to put random groups of units without a leader into formation at all. While I can appreciate that they need a leader, it makes extra units almost useless, especially in single player games when you're given only a certain number of heroes without the chance of gaining more. What's worse is that these single melee units without a leader won't even help their comrades when in a battle unless they're attacked themselves. Ranged units seemed to have no problem with this interestingly enough. I have learned by now to only group infantry and other melee units to leaders and just bring a back-up group of ranged fighters to join in the fray on their own. This really is a much bigger problem during single player games against AI that is much better at organizing groups of units than you are unless you're one of those ~800 clicks a minute~ RTS whiz kids.   Groups of units attached to leaders could also do with a feature to rotate formations to face certain directions. Having meta-formations for multiple formations would also have been helpful although that is a much smaller issue that's easily lived without.   More important are some movement issues with units both in and out of leader groups. Firstly, pathfinding can be unhealthy for your units. Let's take a level in the adventure mode for example. You'll have to break into a city in order to destroy a lot of barracks and eventually kill an officer as well as destroy a stronghold. The wall guarding the city stretches the entire length of the map. I managed to destroy basically every tower and gate along the bottom half of the wall in order to get my troops inside without being harmed. From there, I sent in quick horsemen to erect siege weapons and take down the barracks. When enemies would respond, I would tell my units to run back to a fort for protection, but they would run not through the destroyed walls, but up to the north through all of the towers and gates still in tact and get killed. What sense does that make? None.     This is especially strange considering the computer AI is actually very strong through the adventure and skirmish modes. Computer controlled opponents are not only strong in management skills like most humans are incapable of, but they also have a pretty good set of tactics down. Sometimes frustratingly good. One level that was particularly irritating to me involved chasing down enemy units with slow foot soldiers as they moved in circles, avoiding confrontation at all costs while simply taking any buildings back that I had just taken. I don't like running in circles and when maps are designed without chokepoints where the enemy can so easily sneak around you, it breeds some frustration.   I have to say though, many of the other campaign missions were entertaining and offered experiences not found in many games. Often you'll be given limited resources while being told to attack and defend all at the same time. One mission put you in charge of a large battle with units not under your control commanding reinforcements to certain areas of the battle while commanding a very small part of the battle on your own. Overall the campaigns were fun with one hiccup.    Lastly, while I like the leader groups, I really wish there was a ~rout~ feature to tell the units in a group to run to the nearest fort for rest. The problem here is that if you're in the middle of several battles at once, one of your leaders may take off after an enemy leader that has decided to run from battle. This leader will follow all the way back, straight into enemy lines. Once you've noticed and told your leader to retreat. The entire group will respond by trying to run to the leader and form up. At this point, the leader will slow down to allow stragglers to catch up so that any enemy units (or enemy towers if the leader has chased all the way back to stronghold walls) can beat up on your leader while he's slow.   Thankfully, managing your troops across the large maps is much easier thanks to a very useful map feature. At the push of the spacebar, a large map will appear to show the entire map along with friend and enemy locations depending on the fog of war settings. This map is used often and with good effect. It doesn't look particularly appealing, but is quite functional. My only specific problem about the map comes from the single player game and the fact that your units are all in red, which is a color that doesn't show up on the map particularly well. Finding single units that aren't attached to a leader that have wandered off somewhere on the map can be difficult.   The graphics and presentation in general aren't even going to compare to any of the bigger budget titles out there. The engine is two years old now and I can't notice any significant improvements. It's certainly not a terrible engine and renders units and terrain decently, but it's not exactly beautiful. This is pretty much the same tale for the game's presentation. While there is some small bit of story with tiny in-game cutscenes and historical background in between scenarios, that's about it. Menus are static and the interface is average.   While sound also plays a part in the game, it's by far the worst section. Voice-overs range from bad to terrible. The music, while not unpleasant, doesn't really seem to fit with the time period or the game. Effects are boring and sometimes plain don't work. I've watched more than a few battles in silence except for the music.    Nemesis of the Roman Empire is a good and solid strategy experience. There aren't really a whole lot of experiences like it aside from maybe Praetorians (which is actually pretty comparable), in some ways the Total War games, and of course Celtic Kings: Rage of War, the predecessor to this title. There's a lot to enjoy here and I hope that some of you looking for a new experience will give it a try. Those that enjoyed the first will undoubtedly enjoy more of the same. Those that didn't enjoy the first aren't going to find anything new to draw them back.It doesn't have the prim and polish that games like Age of Mythology and WarCraft III might have, but the core strategy is definitely there. Some annoyances with pathfinding and some grouping issues are really the biggest downfalls here.It would have been nice to have some better sound and a new engine, but those things are pretty peripheral to a basic strategy experience. This game isn't going to compare to something like Rome: Total War due later this year, but it's a good interim game that should give plenty of hours of gaming even for veteran RTS fans.", "date": "Apr 6, 2004"}
