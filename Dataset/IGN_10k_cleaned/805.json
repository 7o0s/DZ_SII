Oh sure, the favorite pseduo-sport of Al Bundy, Homer Simpson, and guys who'd seem more in character shouting ~Get in my belly, wee man!~ than ~*@^!$# gutterball!~ doesn't seem like the most likely candidate for a computer game, but we've seen stranger fare.   PBA Bowling 2 may not be as macho as Head Games' Full Strength Strongman Competition or as shady as Gremlin's Pool Shark, but just like these other overlooked titles, no self-respecting, red-blooded American male should be able to fend off the temptation to give it a look.  According to Bethesda Softworks, PBA Bowling 2 is the most realistic bowling simulation for the PC.  They've probably spent months whipping their programming team like slaves to make sure that the ball, lane, and pin physics are impeccably accurate.  The only thing you'll care about, however, is whether or not your poorly dressed alter-ego can actually pick up a split.  To its credit, the game succeeds in this area, although trying to get the hang of the interface is a serious bitch.  Yes, it is actually possible to make hook shots and whap the pins hard enough to make them fly into one another, but it ain't easy.  Because this title uses a multi-click interface akin to the swing meter found in golf sims such as the PGA Tour Series, you'll have to have the reflexes of a cobra to bowl decently.  Hitting the space bar fast enough to properly set your ball's accuracy, power, and spin/backspin is a challenge worthy of a Shaolin master.  You'll find it works better to just move your bowler into the proper position then set up a drinking bird toy over the keyboard and let it do the work.  And work would be the operating word here, because play sessions are as exciting as a 12 hour Webster marathon.  Why in God's name anyone would want to buy a bowling sim that forces players to sit through everyone's turn just like they'd have to do at their local alley is beyond me.  During the wait, you'll have plenty of time to mull over the fact that the AI controlled players, whose difficulty level can't be adjusted, seldom miss what they aim for.  Feel like lowering your self-esteem?  There's nothing quite like watching the computer rack up strike after strike while your ball routinely lands in the gutter, prompting you to curse like a grizzled sailor.  Now that's entertainment.  But perhaps I'm being a bit too harsh.  In some ways PBA Bowling 2 is palatable, provided you're willing to overlook the fact that it has no long term play modes whatsoever.  Leaving owners with rather limited options for practice runs as well as regular and team games, they're also guaranteed to get limited enjoyment and replay value out of the title as well.  As an act of mercy on Bethesda's part, it's at least possible to run through a set of ten frames in under thirty minutes.  Then again, having more than two people involved increases play time exponentially.  However long one plays for though, they'll soon realize that while taking pot shots at pins can be a diverting goal, it's hardly the stuff great games are made of.  Things could have been improved slightly with proper multiplayer support, but the designers opted instead to make head to head match-ups available only on the same computer.  Problems are compounded by the program's distinct lack of charm. On the personality scale, it ranks slightly above a sweaty gym sock.  For example, though it's nice to design your own bowler down to their facial hair and geeky shoes, the facial shot which corresponds to them never changes or displays any emotion whatsoever.  And while the polygonal putzes you control occasionally slap the ground in frustration or dance about, they never curse, shout, or complain like their real-life counterparts.  Even the various alleys such as Piccard Lanes, Incred-A-Bowl or Showboat which serve as the backdrops for competitions are dull and lifeless.  It's not exactly a plus when infrequent glimpses of the nacho bar and computer bowlers enjoying a game are all that offer a break from the monotony.  Would it have been too much to ask for a little animated sequence when you pull off a strike or spare?  Even this simple feature, which livens up even the most half-assed bowling alleys, somehow hasn't made it to the PC.  Let's check the scoreboard...  It's PBA Bowling 2 - 1, sweaty gym sock - 0.    But the sock wins by a landslide when it comes to visual appeal, because  PBA Bowling 2's designers have gone retro when it comes to the game's visual  flair...way retro.  Aside from a few average quality fly by shots of the  ball striking the pins, there's little in the way of eye candy offered.   Bowlers are 3D models composed of reasonably well crafted, if basic  textures, yet their movements are stiff and unnatural.  We're talking to the  point that it's a small wonder they don't launch into a full blown seizure.   Given one look at their surroundings, who could blame them?  Take for  instance the backgrounds, which are made from a hybrid of 3D objects  (benches, coke machines, etc.) and still pictures.   Suffice it to say that  the end result looks about as promising as Gary Coleman's current financial  situation.  Even more horrifying, however, are the scoreboards, which appear  to be rendered in stunning EGA, complete with a font that most shareware historians believed to be extinct circa 1992. Topping off the experience is the punchy, synthesizer and horn heavy music  that boasts that oh-so-revolutionary MIDI sound quality.  I dare say that  this title's production values would scarcely cover the cost of a Big Mac.  For the ~sequel to the best selling bowling game of all time ,~ PBA Bowling 2 certainly leaves a lot to be desired.  It covers all of the bases required for classification as a bowling simulation, but fails to go above and beyond the call of duty in any regard.  Don't get me wrong, it's not as unpolished as Head Games' Pro Bowl 3D, but it doesn't really hold a candle to THQ's Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling either.  Then again, what could one expect from a ~detailed simulation~ with a manual that's only eight pages long (including covers and credits, mind you).  Ironically, for a title with big, heavy balls, PBA Bowling 2 is as bland as a rice cake.  -- Scott Steinberg", "date": "Mar 24, 2000"}
