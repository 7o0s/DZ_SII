Sure you do. Those pint-sized wrestling figures we all used to play with as youngsters.  Publisher Bandai's Ultimate Muscle brand, or Kinnikuman in Japan, has been with us a long time, and it's coming back in all of its goofy, over-the-top glory. The franchise is airing all over television airwaves now and we knew it wouldn't take long for videogame versions to follow. For GameCube owners, the series hits home as a full-blown wrestling title courtesy of famed developer Aki, which -- as some might know -- has considerable experience in the genre (it was responsible for most of the hit N64 THQ wrestlers that practically pioneered the grappling systems used in today's games).  So is Ultimate Muscle: Legends Versus New Generation a serious competitor to, say, WrestleMania? Does it have the Aki touch? Perhaps a better question, is it a wrestling game at all or does it feel more like a 3D fighter? You might be surprised to learn that it actually falls somewhere in between, and while it has its flaws, this is a fast, fun brawler with a good sense of humor.  The Facts  Based on the Ultimate Muscle franchise of the same name Arcade-style wrestling game Features some 20 characters from the Legends and New Generation Muscle League Fast-paced control mechanics mingle with elements of Aki's grapple and special system A wide assortment of gameplay modes Four-player multiplayer available Cel-shaded graphic style   Gameplay The Ultimate Muscle universe is vast and strange. It revolves around groups of superhero wrestlers, both good and decidedly bad, who battle against one another in the Muscle League. There are the classic brawlers, or Legends -- everyone from King Muscle to Buffaloman (yes, that's his name and that's exactly what he is), and then there are those, like Kid Muscle, who are part of the New Generation. Kid Muscle in particular has grown tired of his father taking top billing and is off to make a name for himself, and this is partially where the wild and wacky storyline of Ultimate Muscle for GameCube starts off. The presentation is well beyond over the top. It's weird in a mesmerizing way, and the writing,, equally out there but also witty, is likewise executed in top form and as a result you're bound to smile at some of the interactions.  There is a solid selection of gameplay modes, from the story to tournaments and various versus modes, and a single player can of course enjoy all of them -- so if you don't have any friends, you're covered. But this is ultimately (get it?) a game that can be best experienced by two, three, or in a perfect situation even four players. Imagine fast-moving, intense tag-team matches where the rules seem to defy logic and you begin to see where Bandai's title takes you. In our experience, UM is one of GameCube's better party offerings.  What is isn't, though, is a remake of any other Aki wrestling game. Well, not entirely, anyway. Sure, it has a limited range of up close punches and kicks, and yes, there are even weak and strong grapple moves, but it's what these wrestlers can do in addition that really separates Ultimate Muscle from any Aki predecessor. These guys may look like costume party rejects, but they are true superheroes nonetheless, and as such they can deal out an impressive, satisfying display of gravity-breaking moves, from acrobatic rope jumps to brutal smashes that start off some tens of feet in the air and then crash to the ground in heart-stuttering thumps. What's more, the action moves at a faster rate than even Def Jam Vendetta, which previously blew the doors off other wrestling endeavors as far as speed was concerned.      What you should know going into UM, however, is that despite its colorful, inviting look, it's not a walk in the park. Rather, it's a downright difficult wrestler. This, because the computer AI is as unforgiving as any we've seen and that, combined with the intensity of the title -- it's raw speed, can make for some very challenging matches. You're going to lose. Often. By our estimate, this is both a strength and a weakness. On the one hand, button-mashers (you know who you are!) are going to be in for a rude awakening when their skill-less approach proves futile. And on the other hand, anyone used to the simple pick-up-and-play mechanics of most wrestling games will probably similarly be discouraged by the sheer difficulty of becoming a master.  This game is chock full of replay, no doubt. But if you ever grow tired of the multiplayer mode, easily the biggest draw here, you can toy around with the simplistic, but still defined create-a-wrestler gadget, which sports some of the basics of character making, but lacks the depth of many competing products. Perhaps something to be considered for the sequel, huh (hint, Aki, hint)?  Graphics Cel-shaded graphics have just about run out their welcome in today's games. But we have to admit, there is a certain charm in the colorful, stylized cel-shaded presentation of Ultimate Muscle for GameCube. The graphics don't feel, as we like to say in the industry, ~farted out.~ It's easy to see that a great degree of care has been taken in the nicely constructed polygon models, the seamlessly skinned frames, and the over-the-top, but somehow perfectly suited animation routines that bring these clown-like super-wrestlers to bright, shiny life.   Ultimate Muscle on GCN  That's not to suggest that Wind Waker has been dethroned. Link's cel-shaded realization still reigns supreme. Some of the textures in Ultimate Muscle lack clarity, the background environments -- blurred and deserted by geometry -- seem to clash with the colorful brutes that frequent the foreground. Sadly, the game doesn't run in progressive scan either, which makes us cry repeatedly because we've been itching to try out our new 50~ Panasonic Plasma HDTV (shameless plug, yes, but it had to be done).All things said and done, though, the game's visuals have faults, but the dense level of character still spills with every punch and with every in-match cut-sequence, too.   Sound Goods and bads here. The title features predictably wacky tunes that unfortunately fail to overwhelm and the commentary isn't much to write home about. The sound effects, though, from the thumps of kicks to the grunts of collisions get the job done as well as we could have hoped for, and that, we suppose, is what really counts in a game where action is everything.Definitely give Ultimate Muscle: Legends vs. New Generation a chance. It may not be a carbon copy of Aki's previous wrestling entries, but it bring enough of its own attributes to the table to nicely coexist with its predecessors and competitors. Plus, it's over-the-top wacky, it's brought to life with some truly well done cel-shaded visuals, and most important of all, it's seriously fast and fun. Invite over a couple of friends, boot up a four-player brawl, and you'll fall in love.There are flaws, too, of course. The AI doesn't mix well with the fast-paced intensity of the title and as a result it can be downright too difficult. Button mashers, run. Pros, you're going to be initially frustrated, you're probably going to lose several (see, a dozen) times before you get the hang of it. But in the end it'll be worth it. Meanwhile, some of the background visuals are downright unimpressive and the music and commentary doesn't do anything for me either.Still, all considered, wrestling fans would do well to pick this one up. And everyone else, give it a rent at the very least and see if it's right for you.", "date": "Jun 6, 2003"}
