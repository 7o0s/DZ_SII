Later emperors would drive the empire into ruin before it was finally shattered, but in Vivendi's mobile simulation game, you are in charge of more prosperous times. As a governor under Caesar, you are tasked with building great cities that will one day be beacons within the empire. But the birth of a civilization isn't without hazard, and while making your people happy, you must fend off attacks from neighboring states and please heretic gods that can smite your empire from the heavens.   There are two modes in Caesar, a full campaign that teaches you the basics of empire building before turning you loose to be your own Romulus and a free play mode that lets you move at your own pace, trying out different city plans without any real objectives. While there is some fun to be hand is the free play mode, the majority of my time with Caesar was exploring the campaign mode.   The first handful of missions is designed to acquaint you with the necessary mechanics of starting and maintaining an empire. You must build enough dwelling for your growing populace, as well as provide basic services like food and commerce. Soon, you learn diplomacy and trade for dealing with other cities. The final necessary skill is military, as not everybody is exactly excited about the rise of Rome. You can hire spies to discover enemy fortifications, train soldiers, and build up defenses for inevitable conflict. And, from time to time, you better watch for the wrath of great Zeus.   Caesar employs a smart interface that makes it easy to build up your cities. From the OK button, you can choose to build, destroy, check city status, and see the growing world. There are over two dozen different buildings to choose from, each with different functionality. Dwellings are always in need -- you must have housing. Health must be maintained with water supplies. Markets foster commerce, giving you goods to export for cash. Happiness is achieved through great architectural works and education. Defenses such as watchtowers and barracks help you get ready for the inevitability of war in the ancient world.   Within minutes of starting any mission, you have a bustling city that looks alive with people. Roads connecting buildings are active with pedestrians. The immediate nature of creating buildings -- there is no real construction phase -- gives an immediate sense of accomplishment. But as you press deeper into the campaign, things get incredibly hectic. Trade agreements must be constantly maintained, for example. Hygiene must always be addressed with fresh water needs. Your bank will skyrocket as nosedive as you face prosperity and misfortune, something within just a few minutes. But at no point does this spiral out of control, becoming an un-fun mess.   The main campaign is not terribly long -- something that may bother value-minded gamers. However, there is the free play mode to add an hour or so to the game and I suspect big fans of the genre might enjoy going for another lap through the earlier missions to try building tricks and military plans honed in later stages.  Caesar is a solid sim for mobile thanks to a smart interface, good pacing, and appealing presentation. Gamers fond of Civilization-style empire builders will find much to enjoy here, as they design magnificent Roman metropolises with mighty temples and bustling marketplaces. Each mission has manageable goals that require a little work to achieve, but the game never overwhelms. While I'd certainly not go so far as to say Caesar is casual, it's entry point is just right for anybody interested in becoming a Roman emperor to get their toga wet.", "date": "Jun 5, 2007"}
