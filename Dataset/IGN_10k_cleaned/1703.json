Not the excremental taste of something like Braveheart you understand -- more the Robitussinesque taste of The Grinch. But like both of those titles, Freedom: First Resistance is another licensing deal turned bad. Based on Anne McCaffrey's Freedom series, Freedom: First Resistance is a game that suffers from poor implementation of mundane concepts.  The short version is this: An evil race of aliens known as the Catteni have invaded Earth and shipped all the humans (well, almost all) off to labor camps. You play as Angel Sanchez, a leader in the resistance movement. Other rebels join her in her fight to throw off the yoke of alien oppression. You'll take control of the action in the third-person using the mouse to control the camera and your character's facing. You can switch freely between the characters in your party (you'll often be forced to do so to solve certain puzzles).  Freedom focuses on a lot of sneaking around, plenty of conversations, some action and a little puzzle solving. There's nothing at all wrong with that formula in itself but it often grows tiresome or just downright confusing in this game. The stealth aspect of the game falls short as some enemies seem to be able to see you through brick walls and other enemies can't seem to see you if you're standing two feet in front of their face. And since there are a few levels that are almost entirely based on stealth, this can be a real problem.  The item based puzzles and the errand-based plot points are pretty ordinary. You have to find keys or switches to open doors. The only spark of originality surfaces when you confront a puzzle that requires you to have your three characters in different locations. For instance, there's a switch that opens a certain door, but the door closes again before you can get to it. In this case you'll have to position one character near the switch and one character near the door so you can sneak in just before the door closes. It's a neat gimmick, but that's all it is -- a gimmick.  The conversation trees are pretty well designed but they take up far too much time. I thought the dialogue was well-written overall and delivered pretty well (more on this later). Sadly the game relies on the same sort of errand running that plagues adventure games. You know, you need someone to give you a battery pack so you can save the world but they won't part with it until you've found them some new shoelaces. Fortunately the setups aren't quite so ridiculous in Freedom, but it's still annoying.  But this is nowhere near as frustrating as the combat engine. The hand to hand (bat-to-hand, kife-to-hand) fighting is simply a matter of pointing towards the enemy and clicking the mouse. The ranged weapons (both mundane and alien) oblige you to point in the general direction of the enemy and keep pushing the mouse button until they die. See a pattern here? There's no reticle whatsoever but as long as there's a little triangle above your target's head, you can just shoot away without any fear of missing your target. Overall, there's so little player involvement in the combat that it just gets kind of boring. And these are supposed to be the action sequences?  On the visual side, Freedom mixes the good with the bad. The game is based (at least originally) on the Rogue Spear engine. As such it has many of the same strengths and weaknesses of that game. The levels are big enough to be convincing but there are still plenty of traffic problems as you and your team try to navigate doorways and constricted corridors. Some of the textures are really fantastic and some of the outdoor areas feel like real locations. The team motion captured something like 700 animations for the characters and the resulting animations are really tight. But sadly, the character models aren't all that impressive when viewed close up. And since the game is tied together through a vast number of talking head cutscenes, this is really distracting.   Things aren't much better in the sound department either. The voices are uninspired (and in a game with as much dialogue as this one, that's a big problem). And while the delivery is okay, the range of accents is unfortunately comical. Within the space of a few minutes you'll run across a New Englander (can't trust a pig with watermelons, you know), an Irishman and the obligatory Jack Nicholson rip off. The cliched accents just remind you that you're playing a game. I don't mind the attempt to create a cosmopolitan atmosphere but the developers could've at least picked some less obvious stereotypes.  There are lots of other small problems here as well. Like the fact that the arrow on your game map points south regardless of which way your character is facing. And the choppy framerate. And the incompatibility with certain combinations of sound and video cards. Ugh. Freedom: First Resistance has some decent ideas behind it but fails on the execution. The story is okay but the actual gameplay is too frustrating to allow you to appreciate the few bright spots in the game. Freedom was a game I played because I was getting paid to do so. And now that this review is done, I'm never, ever going back. I suggest that unless you're a game reviewer being paid to play it, you avoid it altogether.  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
