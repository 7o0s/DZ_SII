{"name": "Namco Museum 2", "name_review": "Namco Museum Vol. 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/26/namco-museum-vol-2", "text": "As the retro-gaming trend continues apace, Namco has delved into the nether regions of its arcade back catalog and come up with a mostly forgettable package. Presented here for your retro amusement are Super Pac-Man, Xevious, Mappy, Grobda, DragonBuster, and Gaplus. Having trouble recognizing most of these? There's a reason for that. Most of these should've never been brought back from the aracdes.  Of course, everyone remembers Pac-Man, but by the time Super Pac-Man had come out, the Pac-franchise had pretty much run its course. Sure, you get to become invincible and huge, but the control is extremely difficult at such an enlarged size. Just be glad Namco opted not to include Pac-Land. Ugh. Namco's other popular videogame series, Galaxian, had also been stretched pretty thin by the time Gaplus (also known as Galaga 3) came out. Little variation is brought to the game, with the notable exception of your ship's ability to capture hapless aliens and make them shoot at your side.  The one glaring exception to this otherwise weak collection is Xevious, a mighty game in its own right. Reportedly the first game ever to feature rendering, Xevious perfected the vertical scoller and spawned a million imitations. So it really comes down to this: how much do you like Xevious? Because when you compare the other five games to Xevious, you're pretty much paying for one great game and a bunch of other stuff, including the museum (and its unfortunately long load times). Xevious anybody?", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
