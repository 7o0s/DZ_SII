The only things that seem to change are the graphics. Rarely do you see any attempt at innovation. I'm pleased to say CyberStrike2 is an exception. What really makes this game stand out amid all the other Robot Jock type games is the inclusion of logistics and supply. Managing your resources is the way to win this game. Not that CyberStrike2 doesn't look good; it looks very good. This visual upgrade is the biggest change from the single player, on-line version that came out in the early 90s. This new game also includes a single player variant that I found to have a lot of depth.  You can download the multi-player version of CyberStrike2 for free at www.cyberstrike2.com. You can also download two of the single player missions as well. I'm not sure what the marketing people were thinking but it seems to me (and I'm not in marketing) that there's no reason to buy the game in your local store unless you desperately need the single player missions. While I thought the single player campaigns were enjoyable, I spent most of my time playing on-line, and having a better time for it. This way you only have to pay the $9.95 monthly account fee. Maybe Simutronics has the right idea-give you the game for free and then charge you to play it.  In the near future, the megacorporations, which have replaced the current political structures as the ruling powers on Earth, fund a mission through a wormhole that has appeared around Mars. Robotic probes discover a lush planet on the other side that the scientists decide to call Syren. A religious nut named Jebediah Brighton is the first human to go through the wormhole. His success prompts others to follow.  Soon a new catalyst for cold fusion is discovered on Syren. As territorial ownership rights have not yet been established, the various corporations begin arming themselves. Syren becomes a rough, Wild West type frontier world. Jebediah appears again preaching his apocalyptic vision of the future. As if on cue, the wormhole collapses leaving the inhabitants of Syren isolated. Worse still, it is discovered that Syren's orbit is beginning to decay.  In the face of certain doom, the megacorporations yield power to paramilitary clans. Each faction is fighting for supremacy during the final years of life on Syren. This is where you come in. You are a soldier in the Clan Wars fighting either for the Terran Alliance or Jebediah's Disciples of the Apocalypse (why people who believe in the imminence of the Apocalypse feel a need to fight is a mystery to me). I guess a game where we all peacefully work together to achieve a common solution just wouldn't sell.  The pods in CyberStrike2 are small by most mech game standards. You won't find any of the big Goliath-type 'bots you'll find in other games. This puts an emphasis on mobility which I liked. Too often when bigger robots meet, the game degenerates into a slugfest. None of that happens here. The pods are all light and nimble enough that movement becomes as important as firepower and armor.  It took a while for me to find a configuration that worked for me, but there are plenty of options here to choose from and a little experimentation will reveal which one will work for you. The one thing that's really missing here is a strafe step. You can't move side to side with your pod. The next best thing is to twist 90 degrees to the right or left and walk forward and backward. While this seemed to be a tactic other players had mastered, I could never get it to work right.  The small size of the pods limits the amount of ammunition and energy you can carry. This is where the game gets really interesting as you try to coordinate your logistics and energy supply on the battlefield. A pods energy supply is limited and quickly depleted when in combat. The only way to regain energy is by getting close to one of your own Clan's energy towers. These are dropped onto the battlefield at your request and once placed can never be moved. Since they are totally defenseless, your strategy is to defend your own towers while depriving the enemy of his own.  You can also call in extra weapons and equipment while in the middle of a mission. These items are removed from a stockpile that you set before each battle. After each mission you can salvage any equipment left on the battlefield and add it to your stores. You call in these weapons and towers using ships that fly above the battlefield.  The single player side of this game is enjoyable. You pick one of two campaigns, each of which contains over twenty missions. Each comes with an intriguing story and really well done cut scenes. The missions are graded to provide new players an opportunity to grow familiar with the interface before throwing them into the jaws of the enemy. Even on the medium difficulty setting, the game is tough to beat. The enemy pods are smart and fast and change tactics frequently enough to keep you on your toes.  Once you've played your first few missions, you'll be promoted to squad leader. You're given more control over the management of your squad both within and between the missions. You are given the authority (and responsibility) of arming all the pods in your team. You must purchase and sell new pods and new weapons as the game progresses. Luckily, you can find a lot of scrap and salvage lying on the battlefield after each mission. You are also responsible for your own pilot roster. You choose whom you hire and whom you fire. While some may feel that this is all a big administrative headache (For God's sake! Let me just shoot something!), but the interface is simple and it only added to my enjoyment of the game.  Although the single player game is great, the multi-player version of CyberStrike2 is where I really had fun. For starters, it's the easiest and fastest multi-player service I've found yet. Unfortunately, the only way to play against other people is through the Simutronic's server. This service costs ten bucks a month with full access to all the maps, equipment and pods. A limited version is offered for free where you only get access to 6 of the 16 battle maps and only 10 of the 60 pod add-ons-weapons, armor and stuff.  You choose one of four sides and join in a team effort to destroy the other three factions. Each of the arenas is open 24 hours a day and you can come and go as you please. The emphasis on team play forces you to interact with the other players and helps to make this a very cooperative game. You'll find yourself working together with folks you don't even know. Very often it will take two or three of your pods working in unison to destroy even one enemy pod. Likewise, if you get killed facing only one pod, you can be sure it was probably carelessness on your part.  The multi-player environment lacks a lot of player designated, mission specific options. The games are really just search and destroy sorties-although the strategic value of energy towers means that certain areas will be heavily contested. Often in these fighting robot games, you just wander around trying to kill the other guy. The inclusion of energy towers makes combat fierce and territorial.  A word of warning-experience keeps a costly school and the guys and gals in the arenas aren't kidding. It took me a long time to get good enough to even hold my own, much less to start racking up my own kills. Fortunately there's a ~new player~ arena where the competition is less fierce. It's best to start here before moving on to other arenas. You will soon begin to recognize the stronger players by reputation. Hint: they're the ones who are constantly killing you.  I was disappointed that players tended to congregate towards only two of the 16 available maps. Large fire fights with up to 32 players would have been great in several of the environments but for some reason players tended to stick with the same two over and over again. While they're great maps, a little variety would go a long way to making this game even better. What makes up for this is the fact that you'll always be able to find a map with a full load of players. This game is at it's most fun when you have four teams of eight players each.  Visually, CyberStrike2 looks great. The pods are a little clunky and square, but the environments are thrilling. Both the landscapes and the building interiors look great. There's a lot of attention to detail here and I even loaded up a few maps just so I could wander around admiring the scenery (the forest world is my favorite). The lighting and weapon effects were both well done and the explosions look great. Lots of debris flies around and some of it even sticks in the surrounding environment. I blew up one pod and found parts of it sticking out of a tree trunk.  The more I played CyberStrike2, the more fun I had. The game obviously has limitations, and it's not on a level with the giant sims (Mechwarrior 3, Starsiege and Heavy Gear 2) but the overall experience was most satisfying. In particular the logistical system adds a fresh element to what is for some a tired formula. I thought there was a lot of depth and substance to the single player missions and on that score alone I would recommend the game. The multi-player games are also incredibly addictive and challenging. The cost of multi-player action was disappointing. I guess $9.95 per month is cheap for genuine entertainment, but if you've already bought the game, it's irritating to have to pay extra to enjoy its best feature. Given that you can get the multi-player game for free, I guess I shouldn't complain.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Mar 12, 1999"}
