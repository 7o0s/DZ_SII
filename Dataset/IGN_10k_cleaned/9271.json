Backyard Hockey from Atari and developer Mistic Software offers plenty of options and customization, but the core gameplay is so unreliable and poorly designed that it's a largely frustrating, unenjoyable experience.    The hook of the Backyard sports games has always been featuring real teams and athletes as kids, and Backyard Hockey continues this tradition. All 30 NHL teams are available here, as well as six made-up teams created for this game. 14 real NHL players (as children) made it into the game, including Andrew Raycroft, Sidney Crosby, Ryan Miller, Saku Koivu, Phil Kessel, Alexander Ovechkin, Jarome Iginla, Jaromir Jagr, Jason Spezza, Joe Sakic, Martin Brodeur, Martin Havlat, Nicklas Lidstrom and Mike Modano. The other 26 selectable characters are from the Backyard Sports franchise and are pretty generic cartoony kids. The NHL players aren't tied to specific teams, meaning Ovie can be played with the Devils, Islanders or any other team. This makes team selection pretty arbitrary, but in a game aimed at young kids a fully accurate roster might have been overkill anyway.    There are three primary game modes available. Play Now drops the player into a game without having to make any decisions. Pickup Game allows the player to select a team, 7 players and rink, but doesn't keep track of wins or losses. Season Play does it all, pitting the player's team against all others in the league and tracking statistics across a full hockey season. Although everything is babied up here with shorter seasons and game times, the game does a decent job at fleshing out the hockey experience with a lot of options and customization. Unfortunately, the actual gameplay is so weak that it overshadows everything else.    Shooting is entirely unreliable in this game. Sometimes the puck will go visibly into the goal, hit the back and bounce out without scoring. Other times it will be shot dead at the goalie, who appears to catch it, even though a goal is still awarded. Bad design choices also plague the game, such as not allowing the player to swap between everyone on their team. Instead, only 2 players of the 4 can be alternated between and the goalie can't be controlled until after he's caught the puck. This means plenty of unavoidable goals because the goalie AI is so stupid that he lets the puck slide by in situations where direct goalie control could have easily stopped it.    For something aimed at young kids, the game is pretty menu heavy. Before selecting a player, their shooting, passing, skating, checking, control and goal abilities are all displayed on a 1 to 10 scale. Game options allow the player to adjust AI difficulty, period length, fatigue, powerups, penalties, offsides, icing, fisticuffs, line changes and season length. After a game has been completed, team statistics, game statistics, game MVP and player milestones are all shown. Information is also recorded per player regarding the number of games played, goals scored, assists, points per game, plus/minus and penalties in minutes. Adult hockey enthusiasts might have eaten up this information, but the kids playing this game will likely find these stats and options overwhelming and confusing. Player stats seem pretty superficial anyway, since there's no noticeable difference in how each of these kids actually plays.    Backyard Hockey comes in multiple flavors, like  The game offers a touch control scheme that uses only the stylus, but is much more difficult to control than using the buttons. The player moves and passes the puck by tapping and dragging the stylus, which feels pretty good (although the characters occasionally have problems responding when they're finishing up another action). Shooting on the other hand works terribly. An oversized SHOOT! button sits at the bottom of the screen at all times. Tapping this brings up nine squares, representing the different areas of the goal (top left, top center, top right, etc). So the player must skate their character to a good angle, tap the SHOOT! button and then tap a goal square every time they wish to attempt a shot. By this time, the goalie has usually positioned himself back in front of the player's character, blocking nearly every shot. The development team tried to do something new with this shot system, but it's too complicated and slow to actually work. Allowing the player to flick their shots in with the stylus instead of navigating through a series of realtime menus might have made touch control a decent alternative. As it is now, the entire mode is useless.    In addition to the main game modes, there are three minigames. Air Hockey is a no-frills 2D topdown rendition of the classic table game using stylus control to move the paddle around. The physics on the puck work well, although the AI is a bit clumsy; on medium and hard difficulties, the AI paddle stays so close to its net that it's nearly impossible to score. The second minigame, Pickup Shootout faced goalies against one another in pretty boring turn-based shootout. After selecting a team, rink and athlete, the player takes turns against an AI opponent shooting the puck or defending the goal. On defense, the AI opponent can always be blocked by standing directly in front of him, and on offense, a goal can always be scored by skating into the opponent's goal and then tapping the A button. There's no challenge to this mode and not much fun to be had, either. The third minigame is called Play Now Shootout and is the same as the Pickup Shootout, except that the player doesn't select a team, rink or athlete.    Multiplayer mode is available for two players, for both the minigames and main game, although there is no download play so both players will need a copy of Backyard Hockey. Multiplayer helps this game immensely, as many of the game's faults have to do with its lousy AI. It's still not a very good game, but playing against another human evens the scales a bit. And since this seems to be the only hockey game released on DS in the US so far, fans may be willing to play through some of these problems for a handheld hockey experience.    Music is passable but dull. Sound effects are accurate but used very limitedly. Surprisingly, load times are an issue in the game, with almost every transition turning both screens black for two to five seconds. How Nintendo let something like that through, I'll never know. What can be said other than this game doesnt play very well. There are a lot of settings and options in regard to team and player selection, but a DS hockey game that doesnt count goals reliably isnt worth the plastic its pressed on. This game will probably be too complicated for young gamers, and too frustrating for older hockey fans. Even without a better hockey game on the DS to compare this to, Backyard Hockey just isnt worth picking up.", "date": "Oct 18, 2007"}
