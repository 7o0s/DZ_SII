You could even go a bit further and imagine the Super NES was just a figment of your imagination. Yes, we know it's a scary world you've just created but just bare with us for a moment. Clearing your brain of all thoughts of Mana and secrets is the way to approach this latest title in the long-running franchise. Dashing right in, expecting an epic RPG in the tradition of past games will - in all likelihood - leave you weeping in a corner.It's all well and good getting misty-eyed over Children of Mana as you remember playing the Super NES classic in 1994 - probably while wearing a shell suit and listening to Take That - but it won't help you to appreciate this game at all. Apart from the name, this has very little to do with Secret of Mana and has more in common with fellow DS dungeon crawler Pokmon Mystery Dungeon. It's not really an RPG at all, it's a hack-and-slasher with stats.Things do start off well for Children of Mana because it looks absolutely spectacular. If Jesus were to perform miracles with sprites then the result would look almost as good as this. The art style feels fresh but, at the same time, it seems suitably steeped in fantasy tradition, thanks to familiar locations like small villages, ice castles and deserts. In fact, it's traditional all the way with its generic story of a hero battling a mysterious evil. The plot does its job though, giving you an excuse to trot off to different locations and slay some monsters but it's not exactly Shakespeare. At least those babbling characters look lovely though, eh?As nice as the visuals are though, a game can't get by on its graphics alone (otherwise we'd be shouting from the rooftops about how wonderful Children of Mana was) and, unfortunately, the gameplay just doesn't live up to the fantastic sprite magic. In some ways the game does attempt to trick you into thinking its a more complicated and in-depth affair than it really is. You begin your adventure by picking one of four different characters. Like most RPGs there's the standard choice of a magic user, a couple of strong warriors and a long-range specialist. One of them, called Wanderer, is a cross between a cat and a rabbit, so we guess we should give Square Enix some credit for that one. However, although it's nice to have the option of different adventurers, ultimately it matters very little because combat boils down to the same button pressing for each one.  Choosing the more magically adept characters is a pointless task because magic isn't integrated into the game at all well. To cast a spell, you charge it up by holding B then releasing - probably exactly like Paul Daniels does at home all the time. It's irritating that while you're charging - even if it is only for a few seconds - you're vulnerable to attack. Considering that fact, using magic usually ends up being your last resort to beat off enemies closing in on you. Admittedly the spells themselves are visually very pretty - they make you gurn like a happy troll for a moment before you remember to be annoyed about getting bashed by a lizard.Realistically, you're much better off slogging through the hordes of unusually angry animals with your standard weapons. You start out with a sword and until you unlock new killing implements - a flail, a bow and a hammer - things are tough. Each character can pull off a little three-hit combo with the sword - if you strike an enemy perfectly with all three hits they'll ping away into the distance, bouncing off walls and smashing into enemies as they go. This bizarre, almost pinball-like, physics system is fun at first because it's quite silly. However, when the enemies bounce into you and temporarily stun you, it strays into the realms of immensely frustrating. Pinball pinging is only useful when you get the hammer because you have more control over where the monsters shoot off to.    With all that unpredictable pinging, you'll probably stick to using the bow for the majority of the game. You have an unlimited amount of arrows, so can quite happily stand at a safe distance firing towards creatures without them doing a great deal to inflict harm on your person. Okay, so we realise that playing the game like this probably isn't the best way to extract the most fun, but if you die you're forced back to the start of a dungeon again. Any way to delay your inevitable demise is likely to be appreciated. The only real combat highlights are the boss battles - Square Enix has done a good job of creating massive bosses that have inventive attack patterns and look suitably horrid.Unfortunately, despite frequent location changes and fantastical new creatures to discover, Children of Mana ultimately deteriorates into a samey, arrow-flinging experience - broken up by some enjoyable boss battles. While there's the opportunity to do side quests when you're bored of the main story, these involve revisiting past dungeons to kill a certain enemy or find a particular object. Once back in the dungeon, you're required to attack things in exactly the same way you've been doing throughout the main story, making side quests practically indistinguishable from everything else.  Children of Mana feels like a game that could  and probably should  have been so much better. If you enjoy hack-and-slash dungeon crawlers then youre likely to be mildly chuffed with its simplistic gameplay. For the rest of us though, the experience is just far too repetitive - theres no sense of exploration, there are no puzzles to solve and the combat is pretty much limited to pressing the same button over and over again. In small gaming chunks its flaws are less obvious and the appealing art style makes it seem far more jolly - sit down for an hour and trawl through a dungeon or two and even the gorgeous graphics aren't enough to hide its shallow nature.", "date": "Jan 10, 2007"}
