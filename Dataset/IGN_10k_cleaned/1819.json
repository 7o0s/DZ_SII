With the exception of Midway's Hydro Thunder, racing has been predominantly been a ~land thing~ only.  It's probably because making a water racing game adds the whole new dynamic element of water to the gameplay mechanics; not only do you have to worry about taking turns correctly and opposing racers on your butt, you have to be concerned with the physics of water, as it is formless... shapeless.  So doing a proper water racing game takes a lot of time, but once it's done properly, it can be quite an exhilarating feeling.  While Surf Rocket Racers is a pretty good example of a water racing game that has all the proper water effects, the game isn't as fun as I thought it would be.  There's certainly nothing wrong with Surf Rocket Racers when it comes to the options.  Select from six different racers with differentiating abilities in top speed, acceleration, handling, durability and grip; you don't select from any different watercraft, but this isn't much of a bother to me.  Nine courses are available from the get-go, ranging from the beautiful blue waters of the Bahamas, the urban courses of Manhattan River (eck), the watery and narrow canals of Rome (Rome?), and the muddy and large bodies of water in the Amazon.  As racing games go, the objective is simple... finish the race with the highest position you can.  In Championship mode, you have several qualifying heats so you don't necessarily need to finish in the top position to continue on, though as each heat passes the requirements get stricter.  Tricks & Techniques offers nine mini-challenges requiring you to perform certain tricks, jump certain distances off a ramp, and other pretty fun stunts.  Hazards & Obstacles puts you in a scoring race where blue, red, and white point balls are places on the course and you try to run as many over while finishing the race within the time limit.  The game also features a pretty good replay feature, allowing you to save a replay of your run onto your VMU for future viewing.  A Time Attack and Vs Battle racing mode (2 player only) rounds out a well-numbered list of gameplay options.  It's a mixed bag when it comes to the visuals of SRR.  While not running at a high frame rate, it is pretty smooth and very solid as I have yet to run into any slowdown problems in this game.  The water effects are ok; splashes, water trails, and lighting effects are pretty good, but the water has a jelly-like looking consistency to it rather than an actual liquid density.  Player models and animations are decent and most backgrounds are well-detailed with an above-average amount of texture detail.  However, it doesn't seem that your racers ~look wet~ and on some tracks (especially with the Amazon ones) it looks like your craft isn't really riding on the waves but more like ~floating~.  Overall, the graphics are decent but nothing that screams for your attention, and hardly what you expect from a Dreamcast title at this point. Surf Rocket Racer has pretty good water effects, but the game is far from ~simmy~.  The game plays pretty much like an arcade racer, with little worry about specific details in watercraft racing and concentrates on delivering a solid racing title.  The problem here lies in the simplicity of the gameplay mechanics; other than a handful of techniques to learn (i.e. hopping, turbo dash, diving, etc.) there's not much depth in the game.  Tricks are limited to barrel rolls and aerial flips and when performed, they have this kinda ~robotic~ animation.  What kept my interest most of the time was the challenging mini-games in Tricks & Techniques mode, and although there weren't on the same level as the mini-games found  in Crazy Taxi (in both challenge and wackiness), I found myself playing these mini-games more than actually racing in the Championship.  The Vs Battle racing mode splits the screen horizontally and the frame rate and detail suffer no loss and that's a relief since so many racing titles' frame rate and visual detail dies a terrible death when the split screen mode is used. Surf Rocket Racer is far from being in the same company as South Park Rally and those fans of Midway's Hydro Thunder will probably be interested in giving this title a whirl.  But don't be surprised if all that gets your attention in SRR are the mini-games rather than racing; though Surf Rocket Racer displays good water effects and offers a number of play options, the lack of depth and simple gameplay will hardly keep anyone's attention, even if the surf's up.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Mar 6, 2001"}
