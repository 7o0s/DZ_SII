After a tortuous wait it's finally out in the UK. And it gets off to a pretty slow start for a game that's almost perfect. But boy is it a beautiful start, thanks to a series of sepia-toned stills in the style of classical Japanese pen and ink drawings, accompanied by pink sakura blossom drifting slowly across the screen.    Those sepia-toned stills begin to tell a story, and the story is this: a hundred years ago, in a tiny hamlet called Kamiki, a courageous wolf spirit and a heroic warrior called Nagi defeated an eight-headed serpent, Orochi, to stop him eating the village's young maidens. But now, 100 years on, a darkness has fallen over the land. Unsurprisingly, it's your task to rid the world of that darkness, which you do by taking control of Amaterasu, the Japanese sun goddess who has been incarnated in the shape of a white wolf.    And so you start out on a quest that really does turn out to be a bit of an epic. It ranges across an enormous game world that takes inspiration from all over the spectrum of Japanese folklore and astrology, taking in a vibrant cast of characters and a script that fairly fizzes and sparkles with snappy dialogue. Take, for example, your talkative, bug-sized sidekick, Issun, who spends most of the game claiming to be a 'wandering artist' of some repute (and who's inspired by a Japanese fairytale about a one-inch tall boy). 'Wow, someone had a lot of time on their hands to think this up', he remarks (with surprising perspicacity) as you solve one of the game's early puzzles.   Or there's Onigiri-sensei, the eccentric master of the dojo, or Sakuya the tree nymph, or Susana, the reluctant warrior, descended from Nagi, that destiny has alighted upon as one of the heroes of the piece. Okami certainly has a rich and atmospheric world with inhabitants to rival any other established videogame classic.    But the most immediately arresting thing about Okami is the way that it looks - which is beautiful. Inspired by Japanese woodblock prints and pen and ink watercolours, the game's cel-shaded visuals conjure up a mythic world populated by giant spiders, malevolent foxes, and ass-baring imps; where you can take in panoramic views from the top of giant windmills or scale the heights of a mysterious cavern by jumping across massive luminescent mushrooms. The first time you restore part of the world back to good health it's breathtaking to behold it transforming out of the darkness, with moody greys and blacks giving way to a riotous floral burst of colour.     The animation of Amaterasu herself is just as astonishing, whether she's snarling at enemies, taking a sly nap while someone tries to talk to her, or accelerating across the land leaving a burst of sunlight and dust-clouds of flowers in her wake. She's a joy to control too, capable of leaping gracefully, but also digging around in the dirt to look for lost treasures. Combat, when it occurs, is equally satisfying, given her repertoire of offensive manoeuvres and arsenal of upgradeable weapons.    Talking of upgradeable weapons, the overall structure will feel very familiar (and just as polished) to anyone with even a passing acquaintance of The Legend of Zelda series. Various areas, such as Shinshu Field or Agata Forest, act as hubs, and performing errands or completing quests rewards you with new items and abilities that enable you to access new areas and fight more difficult enemies. Thus you'll start out by helping with the washing, delivering rice wine, and break-dancing with an old man, but by the game's climax, you'll be travelling in time and trying to ensure the survival of the very heavens themselves.      To do that you'll need to make use of the game's truly distinguishing feature: the ability to 'control the very fabric of existence' with a paintbrush. Hold down R1 and the game jumps to a sepia toned pause screen; hold down the square button and you can put brush to paper, repairing damaged objects, slashing enemies, causing dead flowers and withered trees to spring into bloom, and even switching day to night and vice versa. Throughout the course of the game's remarkable narrative you'll discover different constellations which each unlock new powers to alter the fabric of existence, and using them is wonderfully simple and intuitive. Slash at enemies or objects with a quick horizontal stroke for example; create a powerful gust of wind with a more complicated curlicue; or conjure geysers by drawing a vertical stroke away from a lake.   And if it's not enough to have a momentous narrative, a Zelda-polished structure and unbelievably beautiful graphics to go along with this honest-to-goodness innovation, it's probably worth mentioning the sheer amount of secrets, diversions and extra stuff there is for you to do in the game. Feed other animals to trigger a serenely idyllic cut-scene and gain experience points (or 'Praise' as it's called) to improve your abilities, for example.     Uncover all the hidden clover leaves (a nod to the game's developer, Clover Studio); discover all the stray beads; buy and sell goods; swap demon fangs (which you can even obtain during the game's loading screens); learn new combat techniques at the dojo; work your way through Mika's Notebook of wanted monsters; play a few treasure-hunting block-busting mini-games; or even engage in a spot of leisurely fishing. It would be overwhelming were it not for the game's superb sense of pacing and an in-game menu that encapsulates everything about the game in an easy to understand format. Perhaps most useful, given that the game might take you some forty hours to complete, is a journal to remind you what you're supposed to be doing.   If there are niggles, they're minor: the camera is occasionally wayward, some of the bosses are tricky and drawn out, and most of the game is extremely easy. Um, and that's about it. If there is anything thats comparable to Okami its probably the Legend of Zelda series, in terms of over-arching game design and also art-style, but Clover Studios masterpiece is no slavish imitation. It is, by contrast, a game that blazes a trail with searing ingenuity and courageous originality, forging its own path with a unique visual beauty. Almost perfect? Not quite  but close enough.", "date": "Feb 2, 2007"}
