We are still playing as we speak!  Although this game does possess some similarities to Puzzle Fighter Turbo, Tecmo Stackers separates itself in some unique ways from your average Tertris/Puzzle Fighter wanna-bees.  First and foremost, Stackers has a unique chain system that enables blocks to grab each other in multiple directions after four of the same color have been stacked together. For example, blocks can stech and grab one another from alternate sides of the screen. This results in some amzing chain combos.  It also has a few sub-games that should keep you busy if your older brother isn't around to challenge. There is a chain game which allows you to practice your chain skills and there is a time challenge mode. This mode allows players to sharpen their skills by seeing just how long they can last in a game of Stackers.  But the most redeeming quality about this game is the two-player mode. This can be explained in two words: super fun. In fact, we couldn't put the game down.  Although this game is 'super-fun,' we do have to admit that it doesn't really add to the genre. Chain systems and combos can be altered to make it seem like there is a substantial change, but it kinda is the same game as Puzzle Fighter ot any other Tetris-like game. It does however have some silly animation that will have you laughing like a loon, plus some great music. It will definitely please the puzzle gamer in you.", "date": "Sep 17, 1997"}
