What am I talking about and what kind of bizarre introductory sentence is that? I'm glad you asked. What I'm talking about is when a game implements physics that lets you be a jerk in its game world. We all do it - chances are the first thing you did upon entering City 17 in Half-Life 2 was pick up a can and chuck it at someone's head, and who could resist creating carnage for the sake of carnage in Crackdown? There's nothing like throwing a car at a passer-by just because you can. That's asshole physics at work.   Okay, so you may not have played either of those games, but this is a phenomenon that crosses every system, for the simple fact that everyone likes to be a prankster. So while the implementation of ever-more-believable physics models in games may bring a heightened sense of reality to our favourite pastime, it also affords us more of an opportunity to cause random and largely pointless mischief. And that - in a rather roundabout way - is a fitting place to start with the game formerly known as Elebits, Eledees.    Don't cross the beams etc. A shot from Eledees multiplayer, with a disappointing lack of mayhem mayhem MAYHEM.  In short, this game is all about trashing stuff. Well okay, the developer would have you believe it's about capturing the titular eledees and extracting the sweet electrical juices from their still beating hearts, but to get to the eledees, you've got to tear up your surroundings. The little buggers could be anywhere - hiding in a desk drawer, lurking under a carrot in the garden, secreted throughout a bookshelf, concealed inside a double bass, or even huddled together under a giant novelty tea-cup, praying to god to simply live through the night. The end result is that you - in most missions at least - have a license to cause mayhem. Gotta kill 'em all, and by the end of each stage, the game world will be in complete disarray, and you will be literally surrounded by rubble. Books get torn from shelves, tables and beds are up-ended, expensive surround sound speakers are tossed into the corner, and so on. It's glorious, and made even more so by the Wii controls.   Before we move on to that, however, a little motivation. I mean, why are you going around thrashing the hell out of all your family's - and indeed neighourhood's - possessions? 'These eledees must be a powerful opponent, posing a grave threat to humanity' you're no doubt thinking. Wrong! The story is presented through some of the most woefully written and voice acted cutscenes we've ever witnessed, successfully patronising every single gamer who plays this title, no matter his or her age.     This is a game you really have to see in motion so click here to check out what IGN US thought of the game.  The long and the short of it is as follows. You're a bitter little kid with a vendetta against the eledees - cute little critters that provide electricity to humanity - simply because your parents are eledee researchers who spend more time thinking about this sentient power source than they do about you. Fair enough we say; this is one annoying kid. Anyway, something happens (I was too busy rolling my eyes and whispering 'make it stop' to pay attention at this point) so the kid steals his dad's capture gun and sets out to brutally slay all the eledees and bring light and power back to his 'hood. In other words, you have no motivation, other than ruining the family home and snuffing out countless little creatures in order to power your microwave. That popcorn better taste good kid, 'cos it's made with the blood of innocents.    So. Back to the Wii controls. Played from a first person perspective, Eledees puts you behind the reticule of the aforementioned capture gun. Point the gun at an object and if it's within the gun's current weight capacity, you can pick it up and move it in any direction by holding A. Then, if there are eledees lurking underneath, just point at them and zap them, again with A. Simple. As is turning or looking up and down - just point the Wiimote near the edge of screen; moving around - use that newfangled analogue stick on the Nunchuk; and ducking and stretching - hit them thar trigger buttons. And that's about all the control explanation I can stand. Bored now! Let's talk about something more exciting - progression.    You go into each stage tasked with extracting a set number of watts in a time limit. Eledees come in a variety of colours and personalities - some worth more wattage than others - while the harvest also depends on what they're doing at the time. For instance, a terrified blue eledee with give you less juice than a nonchalant blue eledee singing a jaunty tune. Anyway, as you build up your pool of electricity, you'll reach thresholds that activate various appliances and pieces of equipment in the level.    There goes the neighbourhood. Boom tish.  Say you're in the lounge room and pass 2000 watts. A message pops up saying the speakers have power now, so just head on over to each one, hit the glowing button and out spews a swarm of eledees. Some electrical devices have a countdown before they deposit their payload, while others may require something further before you can use it. You have to put bread in the toaster for instance, before you can activate it. The cool part is that these eledees are a different breed from all the other critters wandering around, and come in yellow and pink varieties. Collect these bad boys and you'll soon level up your capture gun. Needless to say, the higher the capture gun's level, the heavier the stuff you can pick up.    There are definitely shades of Katamari in the way the system works. Go up a level and you can revisit areas to lift up bigger objects and find eledees you couldn't get to before. It all ramps up nicely too, and by about halfway through the game you'll be  outside, tossing trees like matchsticks and flinging cars like erm, matchbox cars. Of course, there's more to it than that. Some levels take place in zero g, with the game world a cacophonous clutter of floating eledees and objects. Some levels will fail you for breaking a certain number of objects or making too much noise (these obviously aren't quite as anarchic, but won't cramp your style too much), and there's a raft of pick-ups to experiment with too. The highlight, hands down, is the Homing Laser which lets you lock-on to tens of eledees at a time. There's nothing like setting off every electrical device you can in zero g then just hoovering them all up. There are a few other handy power-ups too, including an uber vacuum, a hyper-boost to your capture gun's strength and a cookie which attracts any nearby eledees. For a little yang with that yin, however, the radar and shield are close to pointless.   Level editor hilarity. Sun flowers? Inside? Konami you crazy kidders!  It all sounds pretty good so far right? Well, it is and it isn't. I made the comparison to Katamari Damacy a minute ago, and it's worth comparing the two games again. As you can see from the screenshots, Eledees, like Katamari, utilises a very basic graphics engine. Nothing wrong with that - it ensures everything in the world is clear, and that huge numbers of objects can be manipulated at once (albeit still with some slowdown).    Where Eledees differs crucially from Katamari, however, is in style and aesthetics. Or lack thereof. Katamari was packed with zany off-beat humour, hilariously primitive animations and sound effects, and an absolutely genius soundtrack. Eledees isn't, and even if you've never played Katamari, you'll definitely feel that something is lacking. The cutscenes are a massive missed opportunity, the music - apart from an absolutely brilliant loop on the Wii Channel screen - is forgettable, and the eledees - the only real source of personality in the game - are cute, but perhaps not as expressive or interesting as they could have been. The game also lacks a compelling gameplay rhythm, leaving you feeling like you can approach levels haphazardly and still get through. Of course, these aren't game killing issues, just the sort of things that can turn a fun game into a brilliant game.   As it stands, Eledees is still very solid, with  aside from a few niggles  one of the most interesting control implementations on Wii to date. Its not an epic game; it might take you eight hours to get through all 29 levels in normal mode, but once you throw in time trials and challenges for each level, somewhat compromised multiplayer, and a fully featured level editor which lets you swap levels with friends, Eledees is well worth checking out. If only it had more charm.", "date": "May 16, 2007"}
