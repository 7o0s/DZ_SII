Had the first title had been good then this would be great news; instead, its predecessor had an enormous pile of problems that have been painstakingly repeated in Eureka Seven Vol. 2: The New Vision. If part of this new vision was new gameplay or better writing, then there might have been a reason to recommend this -- but for anyone other than hardcore fans of the show, this one brings just as much suffering.   The problem here is that there is far too much story that's not very good interspersed with action that's boring at best. The story continues to follow mech pilot Sumner Sturgeon as he pursues his beloved Suri all across the land. His only motivation is to do whatever she says and keep her from harm. That's it. Things don't get much better when it appears that Suri doesn't quite know what she's doing either.   To be fair, there's also a storyline that reveals how the military has recorded the flying styles of its top pilots for LFOs (giant mech robots that can transform into vehicles), and learned to enhance other pilots with these recordings. The side effect is that when the pilots jack into the program it tends to eat at their soul. This is bad news and there are many two-faced characters who want to use these programs or destroy them. It makes for an interesting side-story that somehow fails to make the main players any more exciting in the process.   This screenshot could have more action than the actual gameplay does. Cutting up all the massive chunks of non-interactive story there is the occasional bit of gameplay action and it's just as clumsy as it was the first time around. The ground battles are a challenge only when it's not clear what you're supposed to do. Other than that, a lot of the combat is pretty easy to pull off. Just dodge and shoot and throw in some melee attacks. ~Difficulty~ simply isn't a word the developers had in mind when they made this sucker, and as such, the whole thing feels like a waste of time. Sadly, it only gets worse from there.   Take, for instance, that there are several more aerial battles than what was in the first game. In case you missed it, aerial conflicts are when LFOs jump on giant hoverboards (don't laugh) and fly around attacking each other. The action is fast and furious and completely confusing. The appeal of zipping around in circles and firing missiles fades quickly so enjoy it for the few minutes that it feels fresh. The only reason to get some skill in this muddled mess is to watch more of the story.   For some other pathetic excuses at gameplay there is also hand-to-hand combat and a hoverboard race. Enemies can start floating in the combat, which is fun, and the decision of whether anyone gets hurt in a fight is a random, which isn't fun. But at least it isn't the absolute pain of hoverboard racing where you can accidentally get off of your board by getting close to the ground or be knocked into a freefall by getting within ten feet of a wall. Great stuff.With all of the gameplay here being decidedly sub-par, the third volume should just scrap any remnants of gameplay and become one long, non-interactive cutscene. Put it onto a DVD and charge fans of the show $10 to get more of their fix, but for the love of that is good in gaming just don't make a game out of it. It's just mean and as long as the developers are too lazy to improve it this series is going to be an extended experiment in cruelty.", "date": "Apr 17, 2007"}
