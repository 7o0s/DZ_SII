{"name": "Kagero: Deception 2", "name_review": "Kagero: Deception II", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/10/21/kagero-deception-ii", "text": "As the sequel to Tecmo's cult hit Deception, Kagero retains the concept of its predecessor and takes it to a whole new level. That concept is a simple yet unique one: instead of assuming control of the hero, you're the villain.  Your goal? Immortality. The only way to obtain it is through stealing the souls of humans unfortunate enough to wander into your castle.  Deception had players setting traps within the castle to ensnare and kill hapless intruders. Kagero relies on a similar premise, but enhances it by placing the player directly into the action, where they're able to be injured by their human prey and, potentially, their own traps from a third-person perspective.   Play now occurs within several castles, each having their own floor plans and share of obstacles, such as spinning blades and razor-sharp pendulums. Play begins with the placement of traps in one room of the castle consisting of three varieties: ceiling, floor, and wall. These range anywhere from bombs to arrow slits to lightning bolts. Once the traps are set, an intruder enters, and that's where the action begins.  Intruders vary from simple townspeople to armed warriors. While the former will normally run away when the traps begin to trigger, the latter will pursue with weapons in-hand. Later in the game, multiple opponents make things trickier.  Points are awarded depending on your performance in each room, which, subsequently, can be used to develop more advanced traps. The whole game's tied together via an unfolding storyline, utilizing the game engine and on-screen text to tell the tale.  It all sounds well and good, but is it worth your time?It's hard to put a label on Kagero's gameplay (is it action? Adventure? Strategy?) but recommending it is simple. Fans of all three genres will find something to love about this innovative, addictive game.Kagero isn't the most technically impressive game PlayStation has ever seen (it's choppy in spots) and it's a bit rough around the edges presentation-wise, but its unique premise and gameplay more than make up for any cosmetic shortcomings. Playing the bad guy is a refreshing concept in and of itself, but the actual process of setting (and creating) traps, then having to contend with your foe while determining the best moment to snare them is a nail-biting and chilling experience that's unlike any other. Better yet is the ability to spring traps chain reaction style, for which you get more points to upgrade your arsenal.And despite its rough spots, Kagero is still a visually captivating experience throughout. Each castle is convincingly designed, right down to individual room and dungeon chamber. Eerie lighting sets the mood, the character designs are gorgeous, and a spooky musical score is just icing on the atmosphere-generating cake.Kagero may not be faultless, but it's heads above most games on PlayStation where it counts  innovation, addictiveness, and gameplay. Anyone looking for a refreshing and absorbing game that's definitely not run-of-the-mill will want to pick it up.", "date": "Oct 21, 1998"}
