Take the horseshoe crab, Komodo dragon, or even a cockroach as examples. Each individual creature has remained relatively unchanged for hundreds of thousands of years, yet each species continues to successfully survive in this ever-changing world of ours. We often take for granted, or simply forget that more primitive life forms thrive to this very day as a consequence of their underlying simple forms.So what is it about these base species that keeps them alive and well in the 21st century? Obviously, nature got it right the first time. The primal instincts and physical adaptations that Mother Nature endowed upon each species are still relevant to this day, regardless of the changing environment around them. Well, that's not exactly true; oftentimes, the evolving surroundings play both the part of the blade and the bandage, and sometimes it's the combination of the two that creates the ideal circumstance for life.Soul Calibur was born on the ill-fated Dreamcast and has, over the years, aged remarkably well. From initial shock, to a deeper-felt love, to fond nostalgic memories, Soul Calibur set a new standard for weapons-based fighting games, and perhaps even fighting games themselves. But did anyone expect that a first-generation Dreamcast title would sustain its steady hold over the genre for so long? We didn't. Almost four years after the original Soul Calibur's release, we finally come face to face with a game that can not only be considered a worthy peer, but a worthy beneficiary to the mighty throne that has seen but one ruler in recent years: its sequel, Soul Calibur II. But like the horseshoe crab, and Komodo dragon, and cockroach before it, the gods above have deemed the Soul Calibur breed of games fit for survival for at least a few more years, and have felt it unnecessary to bestow the series with any significant features to help it adapt to the fighting-game world around it. But in its favor, a comparatively stagnant progression in the genre has created little need for much more.GameplayTo talk about Soul Calibur II without mentioning its forebear would be hardly possible, so please, bear with us during the course of this review. With that disclaimer out of the way, let's begin. Soul Calibur II, like the original, includes the single-player Weapon Master mode, and not surprisingly, it's changed very little. Players still choose a character and traverse a map, competing in a number of fights that often have particular rules and requirements that you must meet. Fighting in quicksand or in a wind-stricken level, using only throws to win, and battling against consecutive opponents with poison-tipped blades are only a fraction of the challenges that you'll have to face. As an incentive to win (and play the game by yourself), prizes, including money and new weapons, are given after fights, hoping to awaken the completist collector in you.New to the Weapon Master mode are ~dungeons,~ though they more or less amount to a series of fights in generic-looking caves. Not terribly interesting, but the effort is appreciated. And like the previous game, the story that is told for each character is forgettable and jejune. The focus in the mode is obviously on collecting each character's weapons, so luckily the game doesn't beat around the bush too much and gets straight to the point.Head-to-Head Available!Don't know which version of Soul Calibur is right for you?

Practice, survival, it's all there. We were a little surprised that the practice mode wasn't beefed up a bit, especially considering the practice modes found in some other fighters, but hey, we'll take what we can get. Along with each mode is a corresponding ~extra~ feature that allows the weapons earned in Weapon Master mode to be used. Having this as a separate option is somewhat redundant, though it does make the game appear to be more feature-rich. Is this the result of clever planning? Perhaps.Those who think Soul Calibur II is a button-mashing fighter are in for a rude awakening. Yes, randomly pushing directions and buttons can yield impressive-looking results, but against a skilled player, you're little more than an irritating distraction. So where's the strategy in the game? The question is, where isn't it? The 8-way movement is a logical step up the evolution ladder from side-stepping, though horizontal slashes can take down even the speediest character. Vertical slashes take precedence over horizontal strikes, but can be easily avoided with the 8-way run. See the relationship? Then factor in guard impacts, reverses, soul charges, quick rolls, wall attacks, and staggers and you can imagine how hectic a fight can get, if played skillfully.  As for the cast of Soul Calibur II, a few faces are missing, but fresh ones have appeared in their places. And though the replacement characters may seem little more than cosmetic changes of older characters, i.e. Cassandra for Sophitia, each character actually plays noticeably different than their counterparts. Most of the new characters in the game fit the Soul Calibur universe quite well, even the three US-exclusive ones (Assassin, Lizardman, Beserker), though Necrid is standout exception. His overtly Western looks and overall power not only isolate him from the rest of the crew, but it throws the balance of the game off as well. Of course, there are also the console-specific characters -- Link, Spawn, and Heihachi -- but as for which one is the ~best,~ well, that's purely up to you. Or, you can always check our Soul Calibur II Head to Head for an unbiased look at each and every version of the game.Ultimately, Soul Calibur II is what the first game aspired to be: a well-balanced, deep fighter that's easy to play, difficult to master, and fun for both lonely souls and party animals. A little more effort could have been made to enhance the Weapon Master and training modes, and online play is always appreciated, but overall, Soul Calibur II does what it does, and does it well. GraphicsSoul Calibur II is not an ugly game. In fact, it's quite the opposite; character models are smooth and detailed, and sport some impressive textures. The same goes for the environments, though a feeling of emptiness often accompanies each arena. Honestly, we could go on about Inferno's nifty fire effect, or Voldo's creepy, stationary strut, or even Taki's newfound jiggle. But the truth is, Soul Calibur II is not that far of a stretch from its predecessor. Yes, it's obviously better looking in every way, and it is without a doubt a beautiful game, but don't expect to wowed in any manner of the sort.So we see the same parallel between the two Soul Caliburs yet again, this time in regards to the graphics. Did the first game set a high bar visually? Yes. Could it be improved upon? Definitely. Why is it that we're still seeing the same flowing cloth physics model that was impressive years ago, but today looks a bit stiff and stilted? Or how about the laughable splash of water that's created during a ring out from an island arena? Many of the finer issues could have been mended, and easily so, but they weren't. Was it a consequence of developing one three platforms simultaneously? Was it an apathetic stance taken by the developer? The general populace may never know, but what we get is the final product, and that's what we'll have to live with.SoundFor a fighting game, Soul Calibur II makes a strong effort at creating a more respectable soundtrack of sorts. Eschewing the almost standard guitar rock of just about every other fighter in existence, SCII's music is comprised of (somewhat) epic battle scores and anthem-like tunes. Does it work? Sure, if that's your cup of tea. The music in a fighting game often feels secondary to everything else (gameplay, visuals, etc.), so we're not disappointed, nor surprised, at what we're hearing. Actually, the music is highly reminiscent of the previous Soul Calibur game -- surprise surprise -- so if you've played the original, you should know what to expect.The same goes for the voices. Slightly hokey but strangely likeable, each character has tens of voiced sayings that are used throughout the game.The biggest improvement to the sound since the Dreamcast Soul Caibur would have to be the surround effects. Spatial positioning is used to great effect, though it's hardly ever beneficial/detrimental to the gameplay.The simple fact of the matter is, Soul Calibur II is best weapons-based fighter out there, period. It's also one of the best games in the fighting genre itself. There's a diverse selection of characters, a deep fighting system, a decent single-player mode, and the multiplayer is as fun as it ever was.The problem (if that's what you want to call it) is that Soul Calibur on Dreamcast was, at the time of its release, an almost monumental achievement and breakthrough in fighting games. Soul Calibur II is essentially more of the same great stuff that made its predecessor the genre-defining game that it was, but in the context of the present day and the corresponding competition, the impact of such a game has been greatly reduced. Does that mean Soul Calibur II is old, outdated, and even obsolete? Absolutely not. What it does mean is that Soul Calibur did a lot things right the first time and ironically, that works against the sequel to a degree.And so, while evolution is not always mandatory, sometimes pushing the boundaries can lead to bigger and better things. In the case of Soul Calibur II, contentment will do just fine.", "date": "Aug 26, 2003"}
