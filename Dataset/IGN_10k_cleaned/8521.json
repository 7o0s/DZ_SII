As in most classic RPGs, there are hundreds of nifty items to collect. There are 40 kinds of fish, 8 types of bait, 8 types of lures, 8 flies, various rods and hooks, and countless other objects to gather. Some are immediately useful, like energy-giving rice balls and oranges. Others seem frivolous until you meet someone who wants to trade. Your goal in most cases is to obtain means to travel to the next fishing area (for instance, after obtaining a raft in the first section, you drift downstream to a new town on a bigger lake). And if that weren't enough, also included on the cart is a ~Virtual Fish~ game that allows you to try your hand at fish farming.   Features   Battery backup save. Two save slots for the RPG, and two slots for the virtual fish. Single-player . Excellent-to-Good game control -- the only defects being the simplistic fighting engine and the inability to care for your virtual fish from within the RPG. Fishing accuracy, though a bit clumsy at first, improves as you graduate to more complex tackle.  Difficulty level: Medium to Hard.   The Game LotRK creatively confronts a common problem encountered in RPGs: how your character earns income. In LotRK, you learn what it is to have real, gainful employment. This means trading the fish you catch over the course of the game for cash at one of many local fish markets. The bigger the fish, the more money you get for it. But fish are in high demand. You will often come across characters who pine for a specific species of fish and will pay more generously in cash or items for it. You will also have to compete with other fishermen/women in the area. And of course, you must contend with hungry animals, which leads to another interesting aspect of LotRK: fighting.  Fighting is a just very small part of what this game is about. Unfortunately, this shows in the fighting interface. The game's down-to-earth enemies include bears, snakes, eagles, monkeys, etc. When one of these creatures attacks, you have the option of fighting or running away. Choose to fight, and a screen appears that shows the current enemy as well as both parties' health points. A little fist flits at random about the screen, increasing in speed until you hit a button, which registers a punch (hopefully) somewhere on the animal. Then it's their turn to attack (or in some cases just sit there, stunned). That's it. Every animal's weak spot is listed in the manual, effectively eliminating the only real challenge in this part of the game. Though this part of the game was a mild disappointment, I commend Natsume for wisely focusing on other more central aspects of gameplay.  The fishing engine, appropriately, is where LotRK shines. It is solid, if not a little simplistic at the beginning. There are ultimately three different types of fishing (bait, lure, and fly) in the game. You start out with a plain little float rod, a bobber or sinker, and some larvae for bait. Using the same overhead view as is used to move around the landscape, you pick your spot and cast. Hopefully, fish will swim over to investigate your bait. If the fish won't bite, try experimenting with other baits (you learn a lot by trial and error, so have patience.) Hooking a fish will take you to a side-view of the action under water. You best make sure you have the right size hook on the line (small, medium, or large) or the fish will get off. Beyond that, it's pretty easy to land your catch: just let him run until he tires, then haul him up. As the game progresses the fishing gets more complicated, with the use of rod and reel, lures, and wet and dry flies. Fortunately, the included manual is helpful, and provides detailed maps that show you where each kind of fish dwells. And of course there are wise folk hanging about just itching to trade fishing tips for a juicy catch.  A bonus to LotRK is the inclusion of a virtual fish game. The game starts you with a small species of fish in a big empty tank. You must then determine whether it needs deep or shallow water, still or flowing water, and rocky or sandy bottom. You must furnish its aquarium with plants, boulders, toys, and other necessities. Depending on the kind of setup you provide, your fish will experience varying levels of stress that you must monitor. As the fish grows it changes into different (larger) species and you must rearrange its tank and diet to accommodate it. Fortunately, you can check on your pet while in the RPG side of the game by going to a save point. Annoyingly, if your fish needs care, you must then quit the RPG side and call up your virtual fish from the main menu.    Natsume has done a beautiful job of covering all its bases graphically. Standard overhead RPG view is done tastefully and is accented by pleasant underwater views, nifty animal fight screens, and that great aquarium! I really could see the care that went into rendering each of the myriad species of fish, unlike some games where you don't know what you've landed until the game tells you. Also check out the gorgeous composite maps in the manual and the neat 3D effect in the underwater views.    Pleasant, unobtrusive music accents surprisingly appropriate sound effects that push the limits of the system. When you fish, the music cuts out and is replaced by the soothing sounds of rushing water punctuated by chirping birds and insects. Very relaxing!    As for play value -- I question whether or not you will want to immediately replay LotRK once you've finished it. It is an involved game. Nevertheless, the game has so many facets of gameplay it is sure to entice back those who had a good first experience with it. Legend of the River King is a very intricate game. Play is rich and varied with several different but intuitive interfaces. There are plenty of quests in each location to keep the player occupied. Its seamless combination of RPG features with the nicely tuned fishing engine and the surprisingly well done virtual pet mode gives this game a depth and breadth that propels it to the top of its genre. Both hard-core and casual fishing fans will find much to be savored in Legend of the River King. Steve Averett reviews games for IGNpocket's #1 affiliate, GBCDojo.
