Since that fateful day, Nintendo fans have been forced to live with this dismal, tragic cartridge as the only Superman title released for either the N64 or GameCube consoles.  Finally, that day of Titus-inflicted pain may be forever wiped from our memories, as publisher Infogrames has spent considerable development resources in creating its own version of the red-caped wonder in Superman: Shadow of Apokolips for next-generation systems.  Not to be confused with Infogrames' completely different Man of Steel Xbox title, Shadow of Apokolips was first released on the PS2 last September and met a mildly favorable review by our IGN PS2 site.  The game is styled after the television animated series, which may be familiar to some out there who don't sleep until noon on Saturday mornings.  Whether or not this cartoony Superman rendition rings a bell, is it still be worth a look to GameCube fans of superhero action?  Perhaps.  For now, rest easy knowing that it can easily beat the living daylights out of its N64 predecessor.  But to find out how Superman's new adventure compares to other Cube action titles out there, read on toward the final score box.  The Facts: Players run, punch, and fly through the skies controlling the one and only Superman in cartoon form  Play through 14 levels to save the world from the sinister plans of Darkseid and Lex Luthor  Battle other classic villains such as Livewire, Parasite, and Metallo  Use super powers including flight, frost breath, x-ray vision, heat vision, super strength, and more   Brand-new Superman story driven by more than 30 minutes of FMV cut-scenes  Dialogue recorded using original voice actors from the animated series: Tim Daly as Superman, Malcom McDowell as Metallo, Clancy Brown as Lex Luthor, and more  New GameCube-exclusive enhancements: secret playable characters, collectable items on each level, unlockable ~Explore Metropolis~ mode, improved boss AI, three difficulty settings, and an unlockable ~Making of Superman~ movie  Fully licensed by DC Comics and Warner Bros  Progressive Scan support  16:9 widescreen support  Dolby ProLogic II support  Requires Memory Card for saved data  For one player only Gameplay The modern free world owes much to the Man of Steel, and his job isn't getting any easier these days.  In Shadow of Apokolips, an evil entity known as Darkseid joins forces with the well-known Lex Luthor in creating an army of robotic terrors known as the Interbots.  Based on the name alone, we'd like to believe that this horrible plan includes converting the power of the Internet into an army of evil super-robots, but Apokolips' story doesn't really go into that much detail.  Instead, players will be confronted right away with plenty of robotic thugs to smack around and destroy throughout the entire game, which helps to keep the violence factor toned down as the sparks fly instead of human flesh, ala the Star Wars: Episode I droid army.  The story here is fresh and Superman fans are sure to enjoy its classic ~Clark Kent to the rescue~ appeal, just don't expect anything Oscar-worthy or mind-blowing.  Fans of the show will be pleased, as it's just as action-packed and entertaining as your average Saturday morning affair.  The FMV cinematics are recorded using the 3D models and cel-shaded rendering, but have since been squeezed onto the smaller GCN optical discs, and the compression is very noticeable.  But if players can get past the artifacting, then they'll likely enjoy the presentation and story offerings in Apokolips.  Those who are sticklers for FMV quality, however, should consider themselves forewarned. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fcubemedia.ign.com%2Fcube%2Fimage%2Fsuperman_soa_040203_gcn_in01.jpg&caption=%3Ccenter%3E%3Csmall%3ECompared+to+the+recent+%3Ca+href%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fcube.ign.com%2Fobjects%2F016%2F016563.html+target%3D_new%3E%3Ci%3EBatman%3C%2Fi%3E+title%3C%2Fa%3E%2C+playing+Superman+is+a+blast.%3C%2Fsmall%3E%3C%2Fcenter%3EUsing the Cube controller to pilot Superman through the various objective-based missions is a breeze, and actually quite fun once players get the hang of it.  The C-stick lifts the Man of Steel off the ground and strafes him left and right in midair, while the R button causes him to lean forward -- right arm fully extended -- in full flight.  The R button ~click~ is even used, as fully depressing the trigger performs a super boost of in-flight speed.  Again, the controls take some coordination and getting used to, but once they've been mastered, it's actually very enjoyable to cruise at top speed through the tall city skyscrapers and buzz the slowly moving traffic below.  Players can land Superman anywhere they'd like if the situation calls for it -- for example, when needing to lift an oil tanker high in the air and carry it to safety.  Superman's moves are nearly identical in the air as on the turf, so players can lock-on to enemies and punch away while hovering or standing.  Holding down Z will also give the option to check things out in a first-person perspective, where holding X or Y employs Superman's x-ray or heat vision respectively.      These added super powers are nice in concept, but ultimately don't prove extremely useful or creative in Shadow of Apokolips. X-ray vision is always a fun concept, but here its functionality is extremely exclusive.  For example, the second mission requires players to find hidden baddies lurking in an unknown room.  Switching to x-ray view should theoretically spot the perpetrators instantly, but its not even as sophisticated as Joanna Dark's own x-ray gadgetry in Perfect Dark.  Instead, only a small part of a predetermined wall will become transparent while using Superman's x-ray ability, and players will need to be standing pretty close to that wall to even spot it.  The idea of including such powers is a great one, but in this case, the execution is very limiting and not a lot of fun.  When playing through the game, the words ~simple~ and ~limiting~ will definitely pop to mind more than once.  The inclusion of objective-based missions is well and good, but their implementation is not very complex or demanding, making Superman: Shadow of Apokolips an extremely easy game to play through.  The key to the challenge behind this title is to think like the designers and figure out where in the heck they could have hidden the five remaining civilians that are still waiting to be rescued. Oh, they're each standing in small garages scattered across the industrial waterfront dam regions! Naturally.  Yes, Superman can smash down these garage doors with the greatest of ease, lift the mindless civilians up, fly them to safety, and then repeat the process multiple times until the objective is complete.  Other objectives throughout the game are similarly rooted in simply clearing out a room full of enemies, finding an object, picking it up, and flying it to some other place in the level.  This kind of gameplay feels more like ~objectives for the sake of having objectives~ rather than being a creative use of interactive technology that pushes gamers to employ even the most basic of problem solving skills.  Old-school gamers that enjoy tossing aside their thinking caps, busting up every crate and door within a level, and doing so with a very playable and easily controlled Superman will have a moderately enjoyable time playing this latest GameCube action title.  Thankfully, Infogrames didn't just crank out a half-hearted port of its previously released PS2 Apokolips package.  The company really went back to the drawing board in some sense and looked at the kinds of extras that it could (and probably should have from the beginning) include in its release on the GameCube.  The options and extra goodies menus are now much more pleasantly packed with plenty of extras to fight for and unlock throughout the 14 story-driven levels.  Things such as the unlockable ~Explore Metropolis~ mode, which experienced players can earn via collecting newly hidden items in each of the levels, are not necessarily the greatest Superman secrets ever conceived, but their novelty is more than worthy of their inclusion.  Other improvements such as the increased boss AI and difficult play setting help to challenge players further and are actually worthy upgrades that Superman gamers will appreciate. Overall, the list of enhancements to this PS2 port are not worth the purchase alone for those who have already invested in the previous version but definitely make this GameCube package a tiny bit more appealing. Graphics Considering that it may be quite some time until we finally get another blockbuster Superman flick in theaters, gamers will need to get used to the cartoony cel-shaded look offered in Apokolips and hopefully enjoy it.  Much like the PS2 version, this GameCube title isn't overflowing with detail in recreating Superman's animated world. Buildings are sometimes flat, five-sided, rectangular polygons with not even a window to spare on the sides.  Cars and other in-game objects are also very low in polygon count and are generally unimpressive when compared to more quality cel-shaded titles on the system.  The cartoon rendering technique used is convincing enough to keep gamers interested in the straightforward and overly simple gameplay, but it's not going to impress them by itself.  Superman himself looks and animates well enough, with a variety of punching moves and a smoothly flowing cape draping behind his buff shoulders.  When clicking the R button for maximum in-flight speed, there's even an effect that intentionally reproduces the windy motion-blur induced from such air travel by cape and boots.  The effect is cool at first but later becomes rather distracting and even borderline ugly.  There's a severe amount of JPEG-esque dithering going on, and it's cooler in a renaissance painting kind of way and not necessarily in a graphically pretty videogame kind of way.   But on a positive note, Infogrames must definitely be commended for reworking the gameplay code to include both a 16:9 widescreen view and a progressive scan mode for those with the high-end rigs to support it.  The game isn't necessarily technically brilliant enough to deserve such treats, but we certainly can't knock the game for including it. Sound As compressed as most of the FMV elements are in this game, it's nice to see that the audio doesn't exactly match such low standards.  In fact, Shadow of Apokolips even supports Dolby ProLogic II here in the GameCube version, and that's always a very nice feature to find on the back of the box. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fcubemedia.ign.com%2Fcube%2Fimage%2Fsuperman_soa_040203_gcn_in02.jpg&caption=%3Ccenter%3E%3Csmall%3EThe+voice+acting+is+every+bit+as+good+as+the+animated+television+series.%3C%2Fsmall%3E%3C%2Fcenter%3EThe overall sound design is well above average, with crisp and enjoyable sound effects that make playing the game on your DPLII receiver worthy of cranking the decibel output.  The music score is noteworthy, despite being somewhat muted, but the true treat is found in the FMV cutscenes, where players will enjoy a hefty portion of quality voiceovers from the very same actors featured in the animated television cartoon.  Unless they've got their noses permanently buried in a comic book, then gamers will definitely recognize some of these voices and enjoy them every time a sequence is cued.  (Are you a fan of the Superman WB television series Smallville? Don't miss our recent soundtrack review on IGN Music!)It's really nice to lay that old N64 Superman review to rest.  That thing has been Matt's pride and joy for many, many years now and has served as a shining example of the kind of Superman game to never, ever make again. Infogrames has obviously read the review and is delivering a brand-new, cartoon-based Superman title to Nintendo fans that doesn't suck.  For that, we are forever thankful.But on the flip side, Superman: Shadow of Apokolips doesn't flex its guns and impress as the Man of Steel truly should on a system as powerful as the GameCube.  It's a bit rough to look at visually, and the gameplay is borderline boring throughout most of the levels packed onto the disc.  Thankfully, the game is still very playable thanks to a functional and fluid control system that actually keeps this game in the ~worth occasionally playing~ pile instead of the steaming, stinking pile where it's N64 forefather lay dead and decomposed.There's still much room for improvement in the Superman line of videogames, and Shadow of Apokolips definitely takes the superhero into the right direction -- it just doesn't take him far enough.  Here's hoping that Superman fans will get their hands on something even better at some point during the next four years.", "date": "Apr 2, 2003"}
