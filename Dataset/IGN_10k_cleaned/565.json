{"name": "Scrabble [1999]", "name_review": "Scrabble", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/12/21/scrabble", "text": "Yep. Scrabble.  Gameplay Gameplay consists of playing a game of Scrabble. Place your lettered tiles on a game board to score points, and outwit your opponent while tactically positioning yourself to take advantage of the game's multiplier bonuses and triple-word score squares, as you move further on towards global conquest with your phenomenal command of the English language.  Not that there couldn't be merit to a good game of Scrabble. In general, this is a fine translation of the board game, with a license of Merriam Webster's Official Scrabble Player's Dictionary, 3rd Edition to keep you honest, up to 3 computer AI opponents (with 8 levels of intelligence, from Novice to Grand Master) to challenge (or else add 4 human friends), and a Solitaire mode for solo play. The game has much that a discerning Scrabble Rabbler would want in a Scrabble game.   Unfortunately, it doesn't have any of the amenities us simpletons who might enjoy a casual board game would like. For instance, when I play a game of Scrabble with the family, I like to end the session by taking hold of the corners of the board, flipping the entire game across the room, then pointing at my grandmother and saying, ~You're a cheater, Grandma, and I never want to play Scrabble ever, ever, ever again!~, whereupon I am sent to my room to ponder my antisocial behavior (but instead secretly play Lynx or Game Boy games in the interim). That kind of play is not possible in the PlayStation version of Scrabble.  Nor can you fib, and where I come from, fibbing is Scrabble. A round of Scrabble in our house is an hour of bold-faced lies, poker faces, and accusatory stares. To me, it's not Scrabble unless you can look your own mother in the eye and say, ~Why, yes mother. Aboslishonist is a real word -- they worked to free the slaves before the Civil War~ and hope to god that her dreary 18th century Catholic high school schooling wasn't educative enough for her to have that kernel of knowledge floating around in her brain to know that I'm lying. Unfortunately, playing the PlayStation version of the game is like playing with your little cousins -- every flipping word, the game calls your bluff, and you may even lose a turn for your perjury. It would be nice if you could play against human opponents without the automatic computer tattle-tail ratting out your every move.  Consequently, you can't make up words. Again, one of the more fun games you can play with a real Scrabble board is Sham Scrabble, a variation where any word can be valid, so long as you can provide an honest definition for the word. In a real game, I might clear my entire rack with ~Iger Shtugenagen.~ So long as I can claim that it's a real word my friend Ernie coined in 1993 which means ~WOW! What a word!~, then I get my triple word score. Not so in the PlayStation game. That's kawarmeny!  And finally, you can't curse. WHY! Cursing is the best part of a friendly game of Scrabble. In my circles, we give bonus points for clever cuss word play. But somehow it seems that Hasbro Interactive just doesn't recognize the extended French vocabulary. Honestly, how can a game not recognize the f-word in this day and age -- if it's the title of a Van Halen record, it's a word.  Not to put too fine a point on it, but this game just isn't too complete a package to recommend. A time limit can be imposed to punish those who think too long, but the minimum limit of 3 minutes per move is far too forgiving for a quick game. Gameplay only takes place in English,  which is disappointing since multi-language Scrabble boards wouldn't have been too difficult to integrate on the disc. Words are defined in the game by the Merriam Webster Dictionary, but the definitions are so ineffective that it's pointless. The game defines Jibe as ~ ADV: Jibey, Jibed, Jibbing, Jibes, to gibe Jibbingly.~ Well heeberty-jeeberty and pontoon my Studebaker, but who in the hell defines their lexicon with such lunacy!   Graphics Graphics strongly resemble a Scrabble board. Remarkably so, the game captures every nuance of the board game, right down to the board. Seriously, while there are no visual enhancements or special effects, the basic look of the game fits the basic gameplay, and the graphics don't slow things down or get in the way of a quick game. The only issue here is that the text of the definitions is in a poor font, making certain aspects of the game hard to read.  Sound Click, clack. That's the sound of tiles placed on the board. That's the sound of Scrabble. That's all the sound you need.  The game does feature a MIDI muzak track that is pleasant enough for about thirty seconds, but if you don't turn it down immediately afterwards, it's all over for your ears. The game show theme is just repetitive and obnoxious no matter how inconspicuous it seems. Sadly, the option to turn down the music is only available outside of gameplay, so these elevator tunes may claim many unknowing victims.Other than that, it's Scrabble. Now, I didn't intend to come down on the game too harshly, as it's only a game of Scrabble. And it's alright at that simple task. While reviewing it, I tried to keep in mind that tries to be nothing more than a simple game of Scrabble, and the disc accomplishes that.But there's the question of whether it's a better value over just buying the board game, and I can't see that it is. With other board games, playing against the computer is a great feature that you can't get with the real board game, but here the video game doesn't have that advantage. Also, it's not a value title (40 bucks for Scrabble?!?), and it doesn't have all of the features that the PC game had (such as Mini Scrabble games like Anagrams, Rackagrams, or Speed Scrabble). It doesn't have the flexibility of the board game, and with the hard-coded PlayStation start-up screen and all of the corporate logos to scroll through, a quick game will take at least as long to get into as a trip to the closet. About the only advantage is that pieces won't get lost. If that one source of frustration is reason enough for you to blow two Andrew Jacksons on this, ante up.", "date": "Dec 21, 1999"}
