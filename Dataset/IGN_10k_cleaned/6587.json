That's both good and bad. Both are outrageously funny, positively insulting and simple in presentation. But they also share another, less flattering similarity. The fun often stops after half an hour.The Facts Episode-based one-player adventures that make players feel like they're really in South Park episodes. Four-player multiplayer modes. Hundreds of hilarious soundbytes created specifically for the game (using Acclaim's advanced voice compression also heard in Turok 2) 3D polygonal graphics. 640x480 high-resolution graphics with 4MB Ram Pak. Crazy gadgets include a Cow Launcher, an Auto Egger (which is basically a chicken sniper rifle that shoots eggs out of its ass), a sponge dart shooter, snowballs (which can be urinated on) and Mr. Hankey (the Christmas Poo). Play as Kyle, Stan, Cartman, or Kenny in the one-player mode. Choose from more characters in the multiplayer modes. Features a host of classic supporting characters: Terrance and Phillip, Big Gay Al, Mr. Garrison (and Mr. Hat), Mephesto, and more.What is South Park?If you're asking yourself this, then let us take a moment to welcome you back to the real world. How was your coma? We hope you're feeling rested. South Park is an extremely popular animated series by Trey Parker and Matt Stone that airs on Comedy Central once a week. The show follows the misadventures of four Colorado-based kids who always seem to stumble into trouble when they're not cracking jokes on each other's moms or farting. Maybe the greatest part about the series is that it is crude as hell. Its characters cuss freely and explore issues that would make any network television station cringe. It's downright vulgar. So when Acclaim announced that it would be releasing a game based on the hit show, well, Nintendo 64 owners were understandably skeptical. After all, the console isn't exactly known for its radical stance on violent, vulgar games. Most gamers predicted South Park 64 would arrive as a watered down, extremely censored adaptation of the hit series. And, assuming that did happen, what would be the point?GameplayThe good news first. South Park 64 is every bit as nasty as its television inspiration from start to finish. And we mean that quite literally. And if you don't believe us, maybe you'll listen to the game's 'M' rating and parental warning.The boot-up intro sequence to Acclaim's game goes something like this: Cartman, Kenny, Kyle and Stan wander up to a 3D Iguana logo, unsure of what it is. As the four of them eye the comparatively gargantuan structure, the Iguana lizard suddenly appears from behind it and bites Kenny's head off in a spurting, bloody mess. Upon seeing this, you'll hear ~Dude, this is pretty [bleep]ed up right here!~ followed by Kyle's ~Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You bastards!~ All of the above transpires in full polygonal 3D and with animation that looks better than that seen in the television series. And then the real opening cut-scene takes off, which proves to be even more impressive. Watching, it's easy to forget that Iguana whipped South Park 64 out in six months time.But that's exactly where the game's main flaw lies. South Park was put together in very little time. Presentation and sound are great, but the gameplay experience needed a few more months of fine tuning.Played from a first person perspective with controls identical to Iguana's Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, players take on the roles of South Park badasses Kyle, Stan, Cartman, or Kenny and embark on a long quest to save the snowed-in Colorado town from an intergalactic threat. You see, every 666 years a comet approaches Earth and threatens civilization as we know it. To make a long story short, turkeys are running rampant, clones are populating the streets, the aliens are back (moomooomoo?), and killer toys are on the loose. That's where Kyle, Cartman, Stan, and Kenny step in, armed with a host of gadgets ranging from cow launchers to fart dolls.Gameplay is mainly confined to running through fairly linear and straightforward levels. Starting in South Park, players face turkey after turkey after turkey after turkey before finally taking out a larger, um, turkey. Then it's off to level 2, where you fight turkey after turkey after turkey only to face another larger turkey. The last level of each episode is comprised of a lengthy battle with a boss (in the case of level 1, a turkey), where you try to take out the creature before it reaches your hometown. The look is vintage South Park, but the action really gets dull after only 30 minutes of play. Considering the often violent nature of the show, the weapons in SP64 are also surprisingly tame. Snowballs, dodge balls and toilet plunger launchers are just not as exciting as a real shotgun. The pissballs, sniper chicken, Terrance & Phillip fart dolls and cow launcher make things more interesting, but after the initial ~ewwww!~ factor is gone, the arsenal ceases to ~feel~ as cool as the real weaponry in a shooter like Turok 2.In terms of level design, SP64 is as generic as they come. There are no clever puzzles or AI surprises. Kill a certain amount of enemies and a door opens, then kill some more. It's fun for a while, but it's fun not because it's a good game -- it's fun because it's South Park. This is no GoldenEye, folks. And it's no Turok 2, either.MultiplayerAaah, multiplayer. Now we're talking. The wealth of characters available and the almost 20 levels makes the multiplayer battles a much more rewarding experience than the dull one-player mode. But even this mode bears the signs of the disease known as ~get it out in time for Christmas~. We can tolerate a lot of slowdown in four-player gaming, but South Park's four-player split-screen just isn't fun anymore. The slow framerates make aiming almost impossible, no matter which resolution you're running the game in. Stick with two- or three-player battles. Unfortunately, the alternate multiplayer modes originally planned for the game aren't here either, but at least we're getting a radar screen, crosshairs and adjustable time and frag limits. The multiplayer experience is fairly solid, but not quite up there with T2 or comparable multiplayer shooters. The main fun is still derived from listening to all the one-liners and taunts and get your friend's head stuck in a cow's rear.GraphicsIt's surprising that Iguana decided on 3D polygonal graphics instead of going with a 2D PaRappa look. Even more surprising is how the 3D look manages to stay absolutely true to the shows presentation. Iguana nailed it 100%. Apart from looking a bit better, the soft-skinned 3D models of the different characters are the spitting images of their paper cutout counterparts. Utilizing Nintendo's 4MB Expansion Pak, the game also features an optional 640x480 high-resolution mode a la T2. And why shouldn't it? It's running on the Turok 2 engine after all. Like in T2, projectiles are polygonal and stick to opponents (such as the toilet plungers) and you will even see some cool lighting effects here or there. The cut-scenes that intersperse the action here and there look great and will make you roll on the floor laughing.On the downside, SP also inherited some of T2's choppy framerates, especially in the hi-res mode -- but since the difference between the hi-res and the low-res modes isn't as great (mostly due to the game's Gouraud-shaded look), we suggest to keep it on low-res for a smoother experience. Some levels are also shrouded with a thick layer of fog, much like the original Turok. A radar screen at the top helps you see what's ahead, so it's merely a cosmetic flaw.Overall, South Park 64 faithfully recreates the look of the show -- from the realtime intro sequence to the many cinema scenes starring Chef and some oversized opponents.SoundIguana has put its sound-compression to good use. The game features tons of exclusive new material straight from the mouths of the show's creators, including one-liners and taunts for all the characters, including Big Gay Al (~ssssuper!~), Mr. Mackey (~don't make me kick your ass, n'okay?~), and Ned, whose monotonous Vietnam references are guaranteed to crack you up. Like the TV show, SP64 bleeps out some of the harsher swearwords. Thankfully, Nintendo didn't censor any of the fun, letting the characters say anything that's permitted by TV broadcast standards, including ~bitch~, ~ass~, and so on.In addition to the fully digitized opening song and plenty of narration and voices, Iguana also throws in some quick midi renditions of the South Park theme.Unless you're not into fart jokes and toilet humor, South Park 64 is just as funny as the Comedy Central series, which definitely makes it worth a look for fans of the show. Unfortunately, under its layer of recognizable characters and off-beat humor, South Park is merely an average shooting game, devoid of any of the innovations that have endeared the Turok games to many N64 owners. The lack of Nintendo censorship is refreshing (only Satan, Santa and Jesus had to be left out), but the levels are often dull and boring and the armies of enemies the game throws at you in each stage get old quicker than Cartman can sing the ~Kyle's Mom~ song. The multiplayer mode makes up for the uninspired one-player experience to a certain degree, but it's the quirky voice characterizations Parker and Stone have thrown in that really make this game. Without the sound, South Park would succumb to its generic level design. This way, it's at least worth a rental. Imagine the game like a good joke. You'll love it the first time you hear it, but once you know the punchline, there is no reason to hear it again. There is no doubt that the design team behind this title is talented and technically superb, but I encourage Iguana members to wear giant ~A good game needs time~ signs around their necks when going to the next development meeting with Acclaim.", "date": "Jan 12, 1999"}
