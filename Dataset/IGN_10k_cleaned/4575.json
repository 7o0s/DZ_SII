While the N-Gage version NCAA Football 2004 comes with many of the bells and whistles you'd find in its home console brothers, it ultimately fails to make the cut when it comes to the all-important gameplay factor, resulting in an extremely average experience.  Features In depth, team-specific play books Full season mode Head-to-head BlueTooth multiplayer Over 100 NCAA teams My NCAA mode   There are a standard set of play modes available from the start-up menu allowing a quick single-player game, a multiplayer battle and a 15-week season. What separates NCAA from an average football title you might see on the GBA is its My NCAA option -- a cool little team management mode where players can choose their favorite team and customize their rosters based on player attributes. Players can also check out injury reports throughout the season in My NCAA to find out exactly when injured players will be well enough to put back on the field. These little additions may not revolutionize the world of mobile football gaming, but they do a nice job of adding a touch of realism to Season mode.  NCAA also does a good job of packing in an impressive amount of teams and playbook options. Unfortunately the wealth of features are not enough to make up for its frustrating and lackluster gameplay. Nearly all of the N-Gage's buttons are put to use to give players a variety of offensive and defensive actions, but EA should have packaged a set of flashcards along with the game to help players remember which button does what. There aren't any controls diagrams built into the game either, forcing players to rely on the instruction book when they aren't sure whether the 6 or 8 button is used to fake pitch.  Luckily, the most important actions are mapped to the N-Gage's game-centric 5 and 7 buttons -- so you can do what we did and just forget about the fancy moves and stick to dive tackles and sprinting - that is or course if you even choose to play the game yourself (read on). Manually controlling your players is entirely optional in NCAA; at the start of each play the computer automatically takes control of all your players for better or worse, and runs them through the set path of the chosen play. Confused? So are we. Hopefully this little feature is a one time experiment and not the start of an ~Our games are so good they play themselves!~ campaign. You can take control of your player at any moment by pressing any of the D-pad directions or action buttons, but it just feels wrong to have to wrestle the controls away from the computer.   Once you've won control over your players, you may end up wanting to give it back to the computer. There isn't much more to playing defense than aiming your player towards the QB or receiver and mowing down everyone in your path. Passing, on the other hand requires a bit more attention. Pressing the 5 button after the ball is snapped will cause the camera to pan back and reveal all receivers with numbers appearing above their heads corresponding to the button used to pass to them. This sort of passing system is ideal for the N-Gage's button configuration, but the quarterback's overly sluggish throw animation (the quarterback throws the ball about a second after pressing the pass button) can often result in an easy sack.  You know a football game needs more work when the players' helmets look a bit too much like Mexican wrestling masks. After playing First-Person-Shooters and full 3D PlayStation ports on the N-Gage, it's hard to believe NCAA's blocky player models and their jittery animations are all that EA could coax out of the handheld. If you aren't already bored of playing the game, its visuals and long drawn-out huddle animations will make you want to banish it from your N-Gage. NCAA sounds a bit better than it looks, but the better sound clips such as fight songs are reserved for the menu screens, leaving the leftovers for actual gameplay. With its wealth of teams and extensive playbooks, NCAA had the potential to bring an unprecedented level of depth to the portable football genre. Instead, its uninteresting and at times baffling gameplay, along with an overall lack of visual polish and presentation make this one reserved for only the most desperate football fanatic. If you are going to pick up NCAA, plan having a friend to play against so you can at least have the excitement of trash-talking to make up for bland gameplay.", "date": "Mar 24, 2004"}
