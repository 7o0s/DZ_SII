It's a game that certainly works better in-person, with people crowded around pads of paper or even easels -- but if you are a monster fan of the game (and those people absolutely exist), this mobile take isn't a bad thing to have in your pocket for those quiet moments.   Pictionary offers a handful of play modes, including a single-player game where you guess what the computer is drawing and fill in the blank letters, a pass-and-play multiplayer game, and an online multiplayer game where teams of two hover over their screens and try to out-guess the opponent.   Naturally, the biggest concern with Pictionary is the drawing aspect -- how does it control on a handset? EA has assembled a solid toolbox for would-be scribblers, such as curve and line tools, shapes, stamps, and an eraser. Accessing the toolbox is easy and with some practice int he free drawing mode, you can get somewhat decent at using them to construct rough facsimiles of the answers. It's not great, though, and in several games, I could see it being a real struggle for other players (opponents and teammates) pull off drawings under an intense time limit.   The solo mode is too easy for its own good. The computer is not only incredibly adept at drawing (which might frustrate you if your skills with the tools are a little lacking), but because you fill in blank letters to the guess the object, you always have an edge. The pass-and-play is a bit better, but my opponent just could not get his head around the controls and bust out some effective drawings. Sure, you could say he just needed practice, but the point here is that this is a pick-up-and-play game.   The online game was interesting, and it wasn't difficult to get right into a match. With three other players, we took turns drawing and guessing. The first few matches went smooth -- I won some and lost some. But then I hit an opponent that just used the drawing tools to spell out the answers. Ugh. That's the risk you run, I suppose. Still, the online mode is entirely functional and it does give the game a much-needed boost of longevity.  Pictionary is a solid little game -- a decent representation of the board game that millions have played and loved. But I can see players getting bored with the solo game's ease after a short period of time. That's where the multiplayer stuff kicks in, as long as you don't find yourself on the line with a cheater.", "date": "Jan 8, 2008"}
