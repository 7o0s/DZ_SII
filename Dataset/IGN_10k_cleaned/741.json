Among those three games, this is by far the worst.  This fishing game, ported from the world of black and white by the folks at Majesco Sales, gives fishing fans something to grumble about.  Heed my warning: This game is boring, dull, and runs out of the fun the moment you begin playing.   Features Two fishing locations Eight different lures Password save For Game Boy or Game Boy Color    Expect to be weaseled out of your money if you buy this game -- Black Bass Lure Fishing is absolutely terrible.  This game, of all the games I've played on Game Boy Color, is one of the very worst.  But what makes it so loathsome and unattractive?  There are only two lakes to visit and four types of fish to catch, and the amount of actions are very limited.  Also, the results of catching fish are unrewarding, and attempting to reel one in is a bore.  In order to begin your fishing experience, you must choose from a list of options in a dull menu.  From here, you may choose to set your lure, view your fishing data, see how many fish you have caught today, move your boat, cast, and exit.  Once you select your lure, you move your boat around the map until you are resting at the desired position.  From here, it's time to cast your lure.  This is where the fun should be, right?  Keep looking, but don't be too disappointed if there's none to be found.  When you exit the bland menu, you finally enter somewhere with a little color.  Here, you press the left and right buttons on the control pad to aim where your rod will let fly.  When you're ready, let your lure launch and it'll cast out into the water.  The amount of power you use is shown on a bar to the right of the screen which increases and decreases rapidly until you press the A button.  When your lure lands in the water, the graphics change once more and take an underwater perspective.  Majesco brags that these are ~3D graphics~ -- I, on the other hand, can't help but laugh at that idea.  Your lure, out far in the water, lays there until you reel it in.  When you do, rocks and seaweed pass by, but they are hardly in the third dimension, nor anything like it.  Trying to catch a fish here is annoying, and one almost never seems to bite regardless of what you do.  The reason you even catch fish in Black Bass Lure Fishing is that you're participating in a tournament.  At rank 100, the worst possible, you want to catch as many large fish as you can so that your rank increases.  The fishing days last from 6 AM to 6 PM, and your rank will rise or fall according to how many fish you have caught and what sizes they are.  The tournament lasts for 12 days, which is spread into 4 days per month from July 5 to September 27.  Since you are at the least desired rank of them all, you are placed into ~Class 3~.  Here, you are limited to only one lake and the basic moves.  If you increase in class, which requires you to be above the 51st rank, you are allowed to travel to both Clear Lake or Storm Lake, each which is boring in its own unique way.  In addition, players who reach classes 2 or 1 (may God have mercy on their souls), are able to use Special Techniques.  These include the ~Let Fish Go~, ~8 Magic~, ~Power Lift~, ~Dancing Worm~, ~Dancing Frog~, and ~Last Strike~ techniques.  If you think the gameplay has some serious problems, just wait until you hear how pleasantly the music accompanies it.  The only other Game Boy game I have heard that is as musically inane as this is Las Vegas Cool Hand.  It's as if Hot-B, the developer, took about five seconds to program the world's worst tune into this horrible game.  To put yourself in my shoes, think of a county fair in the early 1900's.  The music is just like an old-fashioned carousel, chiming in over and over again with some kind of monotonous waltz.  The graphics, not quite as disgusting, are still ugly in their own right.  The three fishing games I recently reviewed, Zebco Fishing, TNN Fishing Champ, and now Black Bass Lure Fishing, in that order, have grown progressively worse and worse.  Out of those, you couldn't find a better game to throw in a compost heap than this.  Because of nonexistent fun, music that makes me shudder, and a crappy appearance, I can't think of a better candidate to receive the score this does.
