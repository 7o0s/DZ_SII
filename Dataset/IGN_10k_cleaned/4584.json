Nice graphics. Fluid animation. Perhaps it might turn out to be a fun kid's game worthy of the Disney brand. Months later we played the title and our opinion of it changed forever -- unfortunately for the worse. The problem with Magical Mirror and now with Disney's Hide & Sneak, a sequel of sorts with the same play mechanics, is that there really wasn't much to play. Most of the control mechanics were point-and-clickish in nature and the puzzle challenges were both too complex for very young players and far too boring for adults.   The Facts  New adventure starring Mickey and Minnie Mouse Play as either character Three unique game environments to explore Simplified control mechanics New trick button enables Mickey or Minnie to unleash special tricks and combos unto enemies Sneak through environments without getting caught More than 30 animated cut-scene sequences Single-player Progressive scan support Requires 3 blocks for saves   Gameplay It doesn't come much simpler than Hide & Sneak. The story opens by way of a mildly impressive in-game cut-scene in which Mickey and Minnie are on their way to a picnic. Minnie spots a giant mushroom nearby and her inquisitive nature gets the best of her. She jumps atop the plant and before she has time to react it rises from the ground with her on her back and flies off into space. Mickey runs after the object and his girlfriend, but it's too late. He'll have to find another way to rescue her. The setup is cute and colorful, perfect for kids.   You assume the role of either Mickey or Minnie. The play is experience is ultimately the same regardless of character. The point of Hide & Sneak is to travel through three different environments, solve related puzzles, hide from the enemy Lu-Lu mushroom creatures, and eventually return your character to their loved one.   Control is improved over the previous game in that you actually can manipulate the characters to some degree. The analog sticks tightly maneuver either Mickey or Minnie through the locales, of which there are three ranging from a warehouse to a museum and ruins. That said, the sense of control freedom is lost in weird mishmash of oversimplification and complexity. There is no button for jumping or for any real action maneuver. Instead, Mickey can execute context sensitive moves and tricks, which encapsulate jumps when they are necessary. Seems to make sense for kids. And on the other hand, the analog stick does not offer true analog precision -- the ability to press softly to walk and to apply more pressure to run. Instead, Capcom has assigned the ability to run to the B button. It's not to the most difficult setup we've ever encountered, but why not stick with the simple design?    Some of the play situations in the game equate to mild entertainment and some satisfaction. The stealth elements where the characters have to sneak by enemies, are usually well done, if easy. We can see how younger players might be mesmerized by some of the tricks Mickey and Minnie can dish out, or the colorful cut-scenes that help move the story along. On the other hand, many of the puzzles in the title were so stupidly designed -- so outright clunky -- that they temporarily stumped several of the fully-grown IGN editors. We can't imagine that any kids would be able to rummage through these bewildering types of challenges in order to proceed. With this in mind, we can't in good conscience recommend Hide & Sneak to parents who are looking for something to occupy their six or seven-year-old while they tend to other business.  Graphics and Technology Capcom is behind the game and therefore the visual presentation is mostly solid. The cut-scenes are fluid and animation right out of a Disney cartoon. Mickey and Minnie look fantastic and run about the colorful environments with silky smooth movement. The background textures generally impress, though there are some overly blurry stinkers in some of the environments, too. The game features real-time lighting effects for added ambience. The only real downside is that the rooms Mickey and Minnie explore are usually small in size and the camera often shoots the action from an inappropriate angle, which can be frustrating. This mechanical oversight can also add a layer of confusion and complexity to the play experience, a drawback for younger players. On the bright side, tech-savvy parents will be happy to know that everything runs in progressive scan mode.  Sound Gets the job done, but don't expect to be blown away or engulfed by Disney merriness. Simple music mixes with a ho-hum assortment of sound effects. The game features little to no speech, which is perhaps the biggest disappointment from an audio standpoint. Does not appear to take advantage of any surround sound capabilities offered by GameCube.If you're the type who judges books by their covers then you're probably convinced that Disney's Hide & Sneak is a solid outing. The game's visuals are sure to convince some of this untruth, anyway. Unfortunately, decent graphics aside, the title is as disorganized and clunky as its predecessor in most regards, which makes it a no-no for younger players as far as I'm concerned. Though the presentation, colorful and cheery, is likely to mesmerize your little one, he or she will struggle with the stupid control configuration and sometimes-bewildering puzzles.If you're smart, you'll let this one sneak by.", "date": "Mar 26, 2004"}
