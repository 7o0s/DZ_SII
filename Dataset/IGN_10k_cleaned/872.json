Are you looking for lively recreations of modern air combat in realistic situations?  Are you looking for authentic representations of avionics, weaponry, and the miracle of flight?  Are you looking for a deep rich flight simulator that will keep you entertained and challenged for months to come?  Are you looking for a way to experience the rush of the Navy's F/A-18 Hornet?  Well, you needn't look any further than Jane's F/A-18.  Unfortunately, this is a review for Digital Integration's Super Hornet, a pale shadow of F/A-18, one of the greatest jet sims you can buy.  Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Super Hornet is its awful sense of timing, arriving on the shelves at a time when Jane's F/A-18 is barely a month old and still flush with the praise of almost universally warm reviews.  There is hardly a single reason to recommend Digital Integration's underdone sim over Jane's stunning achievement.  Perhaps some of you might prefer the crisp graphics, which have always been a trademark of the developers at Digital Integration (DI), over Jane's processor-intensive visuals.  DI's updated graphics engine has that same clean sharp look they're known for, and this time it runs a lot smoother than their last sim, F-16 Fighting Falcon.  The lighting, clouds, and weather effects are all very good.  And the object models, particularly the Hornets themselves, are superbly detailed.  Unfortunately, this is the level of detail you don't generally see in modern air combat, where beyond visual range (BVR) kills are the norm.  What you're usually looking at is Super Hornet's rather bland terrain engine.    The level of detail is most impressive when you load a mission and find yourself on the deck of a carrier where other aircraft are taking off or taxiing into position while the deck crew manages the traffic.  But sadly, this is ultimately a mere formality with little gameplay impact: you might as well model having to release the parking brake in Need for Speed.  Because once you're airborne, Super Hornet suffers the same lack of interaction that has long plagued Digital Integration's sims.  They've added a few extra wingman commands since their last game, and a very limited AWACS routine.  But there is no sense of doing anything but occasionally diverting AI pilots who slavishly follow the flight plan in the mission planner.  The radio communications are virtually useless because there's no indication of who is talking to whom.  ~Bogey dead ahead~ isn't a very helpful radio call when you don't know who said it, much less where they are.  It's obvious that there's a lot going on during a mission, but there's very little sense that you have anything to do with it.  Bopping around with the external view to watch all the activity has always been a lot of fun in DI sims, but it just further highlights how little interaction you have with the world.  The cockpit interface is impressive at first.  It painstakingly models many of the actual switches and knobs in an actual F/A-18.  But for those of use who like to program HOTAS setups (Hands On Throttle And Stick) into our programmable joysticks and throttles that keep up from having to reach over for the keyboard, Super Hornet offers a rude surprise.  It is almost impossible to play without extensively using the mouse to click on buttons that have no hotkey support.  What's worse, the visual G-effects move independently of your mouse.  So while you're moving the cursor to press a tiny button, you'll miss it if the cockpit shakes.  So you have to carefully inch the mouse around the screen, chasing a control that moves with every little jiggle and jerk.  The end result is that rather than feeling like a crack pilot in tune with his sophisticated avionics suite, I feel like a drunk trying to get his key into the door.  The flight model is suspiciously nimble and the weapons and avionics modeling seems awfully, umm, streamlined.  There are also some pretty cheesy shortcuts: hit a 7,000 ton destroyer with a Harpoon anti-ship missile and it just vanishes.  If you fly below a certain altitude, your pilot starts screaming like a frightened girl; either you've triggered the ~impending death~ sound bite, or your pilot just got a paper cut on his tongue.  The view system is counterintuitive and awkward.  If even Rowan, long infamous for their screwy viewing system, can finally repent with MiG Alley's excellent viewing system, why can't Digital Integration get it right?  Also, the lack of a way to padlock incoming missiles is a cardinal sin in jet sims these days.  Digital Integration should go and say twelve ~Hail Jane's~.  Now go and sin no more.  There's a sad irony in the fact that Digital Integration is best known for a sim that contained perhaps the best dynamic campaign ever: the decade old Tornado.  But ever since, they've merely offered self-contained missions with no continuity and very little reason to play.  Their excellent mission planner (which beats Jane's F/A-18 hands down in terms of the amount of information offered) shows every sign of being made for a dynamic campaign.  And there are even indications that they intend to release a dynamic campaign as an add-on.  They've even hinted that the multiplayer support might go beyond the pointless head-to-head deathmatches it currently offers.  Perhaps with such an add-on, Super Hornet might be more compelling.  Until then, there's always Jane's.  -- Tom Chick", "date": "Apr 15, 2000"}
