The story of a hacker who accidentally challenges a military defense computer to a game of global thermonuclear war resonated with an entire generation of gamers. One of the most memorable sequences in the movie was when the computer played out a variety of scenarios for the war, finally discovering the inherent paradox in the doctrine of mutually assured destruction -- that the only winning move was not to play at all.  Introversion's latest game, DEFCON, immediately conjures up the images and atmosphere of the simulation used in the movie. The countries and continents are shown in simple blue outline. Each country has a number of nuclear assets it can use -- missiles, submarines, bombers -- and a handful of defensive measures to protect it from harm. Plane and ship movement is tracked on the large map as are the graceful arcs of the missiles that are sure to be flying through the skies once the battle is joined.   The world is divided into six broad areas -- North and South America, Europe, Africa, the Soviet Union and the non-Soviet parts of Asia (from Teheran to Bombay to Tokyo). Two to six players each claim or are randomly assigned an area of the map. The game starts at DEFCON (DEFense CONdition) 5, and the clock starts counting down. Players place their silos, radar stations, and airbases in their own territory and place their fleets in the nearby oceans. Ships can begin moving right away but it's not until DEFCON 3 that they can start attacking each other.  There are three types of ships here, each of which is vulnerable to another. Battleships can take out carriers, carriers take out subs and subs, of course, take out battleships. You'll want to make sure that you don't spend too much time fighting, however, since carriers and subs are better used to launch nuclear attacks at your enemy once you reach DEFCON 1. Since they can sail right up to your enemy's coast, they'll often fire your first shots against an opponent. Knowing just where and when to launch your first strike can make or break your whole game.  Reaching DEFCON 1 also means you're free to launch missiles from your silos and bombers from your bases. As with your fleet weapons, knowing how to manage your land-based assets requires a few judgement calls. On the one hand, if you're certain of where your enemies assets are and are reasonably certain that you can send enough missiles that he can't possibly shoot them all down, you could seriously hamper his ability to counterattack. On the other hand, launching your own missiles switches off the air defense systems around that particular silo. Unless you have other air defense-ready assets nearby, you could be opening yourself up to a massive counterattack, particularly in games with more than three players.   The other thing to consider is that no points are awarded for taking out radar stations or missile silos or airbases. That's merely a means to an end. What you really want to focus on is obliterating your enemy's cities. Focus too much on military targets and you won't have much left to use on his towns. Focus too much on the towns and you leave yourself wide open for a full-scale retaliatory strike. It's recognizing and exploiting a flaw in your opponent's timing that's the real challenge here. We've played many games against each other where one of us was solidly in the lead only to discover that another player has held enough of his missiles in reserve to really do some damage after all the other opponents have been weakened. Since bombers can re-arm on any available carrier and airbase, there's almost always someone who has a surprise or two left.  Each player starts with the same number of assets so the game will be won by whoever has best arranged their forces and who knows when and where to strike. To be fair, the continent of Europe is so small that it's almost too easy to defend since almost every unit has a range big enough to protect the entire country. It does however have a lot of open water around it where enemy subs can sneak in unnoticed.      Though the Cold War is over, you can't help but be aware of the current world situation when you're playing the game. Even without the news reports of nuclear weapons tests around the world, you're bound to feel more than a little uneasy when launching a nuclear attack that takes out Houston or Kinshasa or Beijing. Far from being unintentionally tacky, this guilty pleasure is actually a celebrated part of the game. You're supposed to squirm a bit when you kill 700,000 people with the press of a button.  Still, killing is what it's all about here. After the game reaches DEFCON 1, you'll have a set time in which to gain as many points as possible by nuking the enemy's population and keeping your own citizens alive. By default, the game is weighted towards killing more than protecting, so the action gets very hot very quickly.   The game is meant to be played online against human opponents, but you can always sub in CPU players for larger or solo matches. There are a number of game types here but there's not a great deal of variety among them. In one, all the players start as allies and only score points for protecting their people, not for killing others. In this case, it's the country that's best defended that will win. Snce you all start as allies, you know exactly how each player has arranged their forces and can take full advantage of any gaps in their coverage.  Another option for a larger map of the world with smaller ranges for your units allows for a much longer game. The fast speed mode is a real blast and you'll have to stay focused in order to get all of your assets on the map before DEFCON 3. The incredible pace of the fast speed forces you to play more by instinct than logical calculation. Naturally, the CPU seems to have a bit of unfair advantage here.  The graphics are simple but beautiful. The map is very easy to read and comes with a variety of filters so you can tell which areas are the most populated. Better still, the actual size of a city icon on the map is proportional to the population level of the city. This makes it easy to prioritize your targets. Ship and sub graphics are plain but I like that you can see whether or not a sub is ready to fire and how many missiles are still on board. The same is true of the fighters and bombers on your carriers and at your airbases. In fact, there's not a part of this game that's not easy to understand at a glance. Best of all, when a nuke does land, it blooms into this bright round circle that is at once, very satisfying and very unsettling.   The sound in DEFCON is rather limited but still effective. Klaxon warnings for new DEFCON levels definitely get you in the right frame of mind for the game. There's also this unnerving coughing sound that crops up when you start flinging missiles around. I'm not sure exactly why, but it seems to fit perfectly. The other effects and noises are serviceable. Too much would have destroyed the detachment which is so essential to the game's eerie atmosphere.  As much fun as we've been having with DEFCON, there are some obvious areas for improvement here. First, the huge arc of the missile paths really frustrates your planning and timing. While it certainly looks cool, having your missiles travel so far out of their path gives third parties a chance to shoot them down. Nukes launched from Cairo to Mexico City, for instance, will travel directly over London and Chicago, giving European and North American units the chance to shoot them down.  It's less of an issue that non-allied nations would even bother to shoot down missiles that aren't even targeting their own territory. (Shooting down the bombers, we can understand.) What bothers us is that our own defenses fire on missiles heading to one of our enemy's territories. On the plus side, the automated defenses are at least smart enough to prioritize the ICBMs over fighters and bombers.  There are also some aggravations with the basic setup of the servers. The game lacks a ~play again~ option at the end of each session and doesn't even drop the players back into the server setup screen once the match is over. Consequently, repeated matches against the same people require starting and rejoining the entire session. I think that the game should save the previous game's settings or prompt players to set some of the advanced options for the server (password, spectators, etc.) before the server launches. Ultimately, though, these server problems are just minor annoyances.   Beyond that, we could only hope for more stats. Since the whole game is based on annihilating cities, it would be great to see a ranking of the top hit cities. It would also be nice to see which enemies hit you the hardest and how much of the damage done to an opponent was due to your efforts.DEFCON's a great example of how a few simple concepts can be combined to make something that's incredibly interesting and pleasantly complicated. The nostalgic echoes of WarGames definitely helps give the title a familiar flavor for older gamers, but even folks who haven't seen the movie will appreciate the way this game can seem detached and utterly intense all at the same time. For twenty bucks, you can't go wrong with this one.", "date": "Oct 20, 2006"}
