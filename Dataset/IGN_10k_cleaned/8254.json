It's hard to keep track of how many Extreme titles are out there as Head Games seems to be pumping out about twelve new Extreme games a month.  You may remember Extreme PaintBrawl, Extreme Tennis, extreme rodeo, extreme bullrider, and now ... Extreme Watersports.  Playing and reviewing the Extreme series has almost become a labor of love.  I actually get giddy when a new Extreme title rolls into the office.  It's that same feeling you get when you're just about to watch a really crappy movie that you know you're going to enjoy just because it's sooooo incredibly bad, like Ratboy, The Boy in the Plastic Bubble, or Tess.  OK, maybe not Tess.  That one was just plain awful and not enjoyable to watch at all.  Hmmm ... come to think of it, that does sound a lot more like Extreme Watersports.  As in Extreme Tennis, you'll start off your Extreme Watersport career at the Extreme Pro Shop (I kid you not on this one ... check out the screenshot).  Extreme Benji is your Extreme Salesman at the Extreme Pro Shop (or, as the kids call it, the EPS).  At the EPS you can outfit yourself with a number of different water skis, wetsuits and fashion accessories, although it doesn't make any difference whatsoever what you pick.  It's just an extremely obvious marketing tie-in, especially since this title has no less than eight corporate sponsors like MasterCraft, O'Brien and Wet Tech  ... and you would think that these companies would want to be associated with a decent waterskiing sim.  After you've bought (or at least looked at) your fill of goods, it's off to enjoy some watery fun (you would think) in the three events offered up in Extreme Watersports:   Slalom  How it's supposed to work: the object is to speed around six buoys on one ski starting out with only fifteen feet of rope.  Each pass shortens the rope making each successive buoy harder to pass. How it really works: wait thirty seconds for the event to load up.  Wait for a five second countdown.  Ski for two seconds.  Fall down.  Wait a minute to return to the Extreme Pro Shop. Total Gameplay Time: 2secs Total Time Wasted: 1min, 37secs  Jump  How it's supposed to work: get as much speed as possible, ski over a ramp in the middle of a lake and go flying as far as you can.  You'll get three runs to maximize your distance and the average of the three runs is your final score.  How it really works: wait thirty seconds for the event to load up.  Wait for a five second countdown.  Hit right arrow, hit left arrow.  Line-up for the jump.  Fly through the air for two seconds.  Land.  Watch the boat pull you for another five seconds.  Wait a minute to return to the Extreme Pro Shop. Total Gameplay Time: 6secs Total Time Wasted: 1min, 42secs  Wakeboarding  How it's supposed to work: the most EXTREME event out of the three.  Jump on a wakeboard and perform some sick tricks while being dragged behind a screaming powerboat.  It's anything goes as you pull off Whirlybirds, backside rolls, Methods and Hoochie Glides (hey ... stop laughing). How it really works: wait a minute for the event to load up.  Watch the screen turn black.  Get popped out to a Windows error screen proclaiming that ~This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.~  Hit cancel.  Notice that your system is locked in 640x480 resolution.  Go to Control Panel -- Display -- Settings.  Notice that Extreme Watersports has totally removed your resolution options.  Try to figure out what the f#ck is going on.  Give up and reboot system.  Notice that resolution is still locked in 640x480.  Throw the Extreme Watersports CD across the room.  Call our lovable, big-panted tech guy Andrew.  Get his voice mail.  Wait an hour for a response.  Watch Andrew re-install the monitor drivers that Extreme Watersports screwed-up.  Find Extreme Watersports CD.  Throw it to the other side of the room again.  Keep doing this 'til you get bored. Total Gameplay Time: none Total Time Wasted: just under two hours   There's certainly not much to be impressed by here.  Even if the game was stable, the graphics would still be outdated, the framerate would still be chunky, the sound effects would still be weak and the gameplay would still be nearly non-existent.  I've seriously seen better freeware games and I'm sure there are some twelve year old kids out there who could program a better game in basic.    Extreme Watersports comes up all wet.  It's buggy and poorly programmed.  Even though it sells for under $20 at stores, it's still a waste of money.  But if you just can't keep your hands off of any game that is preceded by the word 'Extreme,' be sure to keep you eyes open for Extreme Cross-Stitch, Extreme Hard Boiled Egg Eating and Extreme Belching, which we're sure Head Games will release within the next few weeks.   -- Tal Blevins", "date": "May 27, 1999"}
