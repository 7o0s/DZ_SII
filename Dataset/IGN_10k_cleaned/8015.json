Call of Duty 3 continues the franchise's storytelling hook, showing the conflict through the eyes of different Allied armies. In CoD3, you join up with Canadian, American, British, and Polish troops as they dig in for the hard slog across Europe, starting in the French village of Saint-Lo and ending at a climactic battle in Chambois.   The series has always prided itself on its storytelling and scenario choices. To a certain extent, this survives the transition to mobile. You are treated to lots of story elements, such as dialogue between soldiers. These guys have a sense of humor about their situation -- and, as you can imagine, this was probably as necessary as an extra magazine.   CoD3 raises the camera to show the war from a top-down perspective, which allows you to see a good deal of the war-ravaged landscape, but renders your soldier and other characters rather small. Intimacy is not a hallmark of the mobile edition of CoD3. However, the greater field of vision plays into the game's use of cover and stealth, and when the screen does fill with Axis thugs, you can actually see what kind of trouble you have just around the next corner.   Using cover is the most important mechanic in CoD3. Employing only bravado on any difficulty level from medium and beyond will result in death. (The easy difficulty is just too easy -- so unless you're down for a cakewalk, challenge yourself with medium.) Your heroes need to seek out cover behind overturned gravestones, sandbag barricades, and blasted-down walls. You can hide behind cover and wait for a break in enemy fire before mounting a counter-attack with the left soft key. (A useful icon in the lower-left corner of the screen displays your current position: Stand or crouch.) By holding down the fire button, you can pick out a single target from cover. Then, use the left soft key to stand and press fire again to deliver a lethal shot.   Cover is also necessary because CoD3 employs regenerative health. There are no first aid kits in this edition of the game. When your health meter blinks red, you need to get out of danger for a few seconds. Realistic? Not at all. But it works well, especially in mobile, because when you only have a few moments to get your gaming in, you don't necessarily want to be punished by replaying the same level over and over, hoping to get a few inches closer to a health pack.   Another pleasing change to CoD3 is the decision to open up the worlds. Before, you were always on a linear, vertical path. The objectives in CoD3 are now all over the eight maps, helpfully pointed out with the same star icon found in the PC and console editions of the game. I usually shy from using the term ~organic~ when describing a game experience, but there's no way around the fact that expanding the levels in all directions certainly make this a more ~natural~ game.   CoD3 utilizes a variety of weapons, from pistols and sniper rifles, so you have a sense of ownership over how you want to take on the enemy. There are certainly situations where using very specific weapons makes the most sense, such as using the sweeping spray of a sub-machine gun on an incoming mob of Nazi soldiers, but for the most part, you're in the driver seat. From time to time, you can take control of machine gun nests and use the weapon to chew through enemies. The biggest boom is provided by the anti-tank weapon, which you must use to get through troublesome tank columns.    Fortunately, the Nazis aren't the only army with tanks. In a few situations, you get to fight alongside M4 Sherman tanks, using them as mobile cover. You must keep yourself safe from incoming fire, but you also have to keep heavy fire off the tanks, too. You cannot just hide behind the hull for the entire mission.   I tested CoD3 on a Sony Ericsson K750, which has -- in my opinion -- a very poor little joystick. I relied heavily on the number keys to operate my soldier, and found the controls to be solid but not spectacular. This, combined with the small sprites, made things sometimes messy to get through. In a crowd, you can find yourself hung up on a rock, but unable to see that your itty-bitty leg hasn't quite cleared it yet until it's too late. I did like that the game did not employ every key on the phone for controls. Things are kept relatively simple, with crouching always mapped tot he left soft key and firing always on either the 5 or OK key.   CoD3 looks much better than the previous game in the series. The greater use of color (explosions!) and the more detailed environments are excellent improvements.  Call of Duty 3 is a solid step up from the previous entry in the series, which was by no means a bad game, but is certainly dated -- and after only a year. (Some mobile games age better than others.) The decision to open up the levels as opposed to only vertical scrolling makes a big difference in conveying the chaos and scope of war. I do wish that the camera was a bit closer, though. The small, non-descript sprite betray the game's storytelling. It's hard to care about a small mass of pixels, and that what the call of Duty games have always been about -- involvement with the plight of these soldiers. Plus, I found the smallness of the sprites troublesome in major action scenes, getting caught on things in the middle of a firefight is occasionally deadly. However, as an advancement of the series, CoD3 offers fine shoot-and-cover action across eight large missions. Fans of the franchise will have some good fun enlisting.", "date": "Feb 7, 2007"}
