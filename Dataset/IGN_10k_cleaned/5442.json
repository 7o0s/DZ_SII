It had problems that I think were generously overlooked by some people, and even I might have been gentler with it than I should have been. Coming back to play the expansion pack reminded me of all the things that annoyed me about the original, and what is good about the game became obscured under a layer of frustration. It has some great music, some great voiceover cutscenes, and a very authentic feel. Unlike those war movies from the 1960's, it won't be a series of flashy gunfights and big explosions. The H&D games enforce deliberate caution and stealth. While this may make you feel like a mature, intelligent gamerthe grim, responsible heroism espoused here never quite sparks a sense of fun. And Saber Squadron adds some serious curveballs into what was already inconsistent gameplay.   As with the rest of the H&D series, the real Achilles Heel here is the AI. Played both with and without the patch, Sabre Squadron will have you gritting your teeth pretty often. You can hit the Tab key to cycle through characters to directly control, but you must reissue your set of commands from a branching menu each time. Hit 0 on the number pad to open the top-level menu, then do Silent Action, Follow Me, exit the menu, enter it again, select Formation, select Column, exit the menu, enter it, select Formation, select Tighten Formation, exit the menu, enter it again, select Silent Action, select Fire at Will.   Because if you do not issue a series of commands almost exactly like this one, the game can drive you mad. Sure, you can slap the space bar, which pauses the game and allows you to issue all kinds of handy commands, so that you can do things like split up the fireteam for simultaneous, multiple objective completion, but in practice, your teammates aren't very good at things like, oh, firing their rifles.   The first level was great, and I felt like I was almost on autopilot. My AI teammates were like sharpshooter cowboys, able to hit a German soldier in the chest at fifty paces without breaking a sweat, and before the soldier had even stopped picking his nose. As I progressed, however, my men appeared to get stupider and stupider. Maybe it was the heat of Africa cooking their brains, but we'd have enemy soldiers running right past us, shooting my men in the back, throwing grenades while my men stared at the devices like children expecting an explosion of candy funit was messy. Meanwhile, the Germans were equally erratic. Sometimes they would flank around a building, other times they would stand stupidly for several seconds while their fellow base patroller bled to death a few feet away.     For a game that prides itself on realism, I was disappointed to see things like map-triggered snipers, event-triggered tanks, and an extreme lack of coordination on the part of the enemy. I couldn't believe my eyes when I was escorting some prisoners from a compound and watched as some shutters flew open across the street and I was dead a moment later from a rifled slug through the head. You see, there are ways to move in this game so that nothing detects you. When you inch along the ground, prone, you are a ghost. Yet, every time I crossed this magic line at the entrance to the prisoner's building, those shutters flew open. Then there was the Panzer that magically appeared near the exit to the city on my way out. I should have known something was up when there was a Panzerschreck sitting randomly on a box in the courtyard.   Aside from the random, impossible-to-avoid triggers, the enemy AI does two things most of the time. Sees you and starts running toward you, or sees you and starts firing. This makes sense, until you notice that they never call for backup, that the hue and cry never goes up, and that you're never eventually caught in the middle of a dragnet search. Those who are slightly outside the killzone don't come, but wait and crouch around corners and boxes, rifles poised to fire as soon as you poke your head around. After playing Splinter Cell, I guess I've come to expect some kind of effort to track me down.   Team AI, besides being erratically aware, defaults to men taking point in the order they're listed on the bottom of the screen, apparently. If you're controlling the third guy, two will move ahead, which wouldn't be so bad if it was for that erratic awareness. The most irritating thing, though, is having to redo all the orders every time you switch to a new leader, especially when you're escorting someone. Coming close in second place was when teammates wandered obliviously into my line of fire.If you really liked H&D2, you will likely forgive these shortcomings and have a pretty decent romp through the expansive levels. If you didn't, there's still the old problems. We also had some significant stability issues, even after installing the patch. The game would often crash when re-loading a save game, and a couple times we had to restart the computer to restore functionality. I also found myself popping into and getting stuck in objects every once in a while. The reload crash wouldn't be so bad if death and dismemberment weren't so easy to come by, and I found that switching to a new leader would unstuck me from the buildings. But overall, the game needs some more technical polish and more extensive AI.", "date": "Jan 21, 2005"}
