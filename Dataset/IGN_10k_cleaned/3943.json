As since the advent of the Nintendo Entertainment System there hasn't been a single videogame developer or publisher to give our past as much attention as it has. From Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Genghis Kahn to Uncharted Waters and Nobunaga's Ambition, KOEI has made a conscious effort to mix fact with fiction for a successful blend of strategy, documentation, and fun. And with a year that's already seen Dynasty Warriors 4 and Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII revisit ancient China so triumphantly, it's really no surprise to find that the company's next installment, Dynasty Tactics 2, is already thunderously on the shelves.   Winner of the Reader's Choice Award for best strategy game in the 2002 IGN Game of the Year ceremonies, the original Dynasty Tactics has managed to gain quite a following already. Obviously meant to fill the gaps between ROT3K and Dynasty Warriors, Tactics is the perfect middle child. It's a faster, more battle-oriented isometric experience when compared to its cousin Romance of the Three Kingdoms, while offering a lot more strategy and planning in contrast to the Dynasty Warriors series. On the whole, it's definitely closer to Romance in terms of approach and philosophy, but its cinematic qualities and war-centric theme tries hard to achieve the best of both worlds.   Gameplay  Much like the first Dynasty Tactics, Part 2 is broken up into two distinct types of play: Battle and planning. Unlike the original game, however, Dynasty Tactics 2 has taken a more balanced approach towards dividing the two -- making your decisions on the map far more influential to the outcome of a melee. Building armies, spending craft to learn additional skills, and figuring out the best way to approach your objectives is what this area of the game is all about -- and it's ultimately what decides how prepared you'll be when the time for fighting arrives.    In that respect, it's incredibly important to exploit the relationships of your troops in order to get more officers to join your cause. Without an active recruiting regiment, your soldiers could fall behind in numbers and be overwhelmed or outmatched quicker than you'd expect. Army editing, spy tactics, and the usage of the training barracks will upgrade existing units abilities and knowledge even, and properly formatting your military will help shape your offensive and defensive strategies. The planning phase is no longer the placeholder between battles that it used to be.   But battles are still game's primary focus with its chess-like approach to the art of war. Using morale to dictate initiative at the beginning of a fight, players have to select their unit types and movements very carefully if they want to survive until the end. Environmental factors, terrain elements, and the direction their platoon is facing are all extremely important aspects to consider before swinging a single sword. But once a unit is in place to make their attack, however, the turn-based interface is a simple as stats vs. stats as the two sides cut each other to ribbons. To keep the user company while these calculations are running, they're treated to movie-like sequences that show the armies colliding.   Luckily, Dynasty Tactics 2 throws a couple of key modifiers our way in an effort to alter what would otherwise be a mathematicians wet dream. Key officer skills, known as Tactics allow regiments to perform special kinds of maneuvers to one-up their opponents. Everything from pincer attacks, charges, and various forms of trickery can be used to divide and conquer with positioning, officer level, and a myriad of other factors determining what happens once the decisions have been made. Further enhancing the experience is the ability to chain combos together between squads or even attack multiple times with a single unit. Team tactics can get as high as 10 in a row, with individual chain combos topping off at six. Once a mastery of the battlefield has been reached and you're duking it out in the later sections, skirmishes can get pretty crazy -- with elaborate feats of warfare on display for everyone's quick thinking pleasure.   For novice users, however, Tactics 2 could prove too difficult a proposition for them to even consider trying out. As not only are the advanced battle techniques hard to grasp for newer users, the challenge level is also dubiously high no matter what your skill level. And with four different characters sporting 15-hour campaigns apiece, that's a lot to throw at someone if this is their first entry to the strategy genre. Which will ultimately keep the game's widespread appeal from reaching beyond a limited market.    But even for those of us who've been around the strategy block for years, Tactics 2 is far from perfect. A lot of the special abilities for instance, are incredibly similar to one another, with no real advantage to learning some of the new ones over a pre-existing maneuver. Also problematic is distinct lack of battle types -- as even with pikemen, bowmen, and swordsmen, almost every confrontation plays out to a similar path. It's fun yes, but a little monotonous as time goes on.   Graphics  Visually Dynasty Tactics 2 is only a minor improvement over last year's graphical presentation. On the plus side, the shoddy framerate found in skirmish cut scenes have been fixed significantly to lower the amount of stutter and chop that plagued originally them. Those same battle sequences are also much more cinematic in nature, with better camera direction and a faster pace overall. Also worth mentioning is the streamlined interface -- which is definitely less cluttered and better organized than before. And the more responsive camera controls and sharper plot-based movies are a bonus as well.   Unfortunately the character models and battlegrounds just aren't as impressive; with rather simplistic designs and maps that look as though they're been around since the Kessen days. Another sad fact is that High Definition and widescreen televisions aren't supported here either, making it quite a disappointment for the growing crowd of high-end users. These technical aspects are one of the few areas of improvement that KOEI hasn't seemed to focus on yet when updating its more recent software, and one we hope to see it expand upon soon.   Sound  Recorded in Dolby Pro Logic II and offering 5.1, Tactics 2 should definitely give users who have the necessary receivers just what they're looking for. Sadly a lot of the music is actually borrowed from the first game and a list of new tracks is pretty scarce. That's not to say that the somewhat dynamic-score isn't pleasing -- it's genuinely quite good. Though it's just not on the same level as that found in Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII or Kessen II.   The vocals, on the other hand, are so hokey they're almost enjoyable. Laughably bad to the point of absurdity (we weren't aware that ancient eastern generals sounded like they were raised in Oklahoma), the English voice acting may infuriate some of the purists who would have preferred Japanese or Chinese tracks. Though the solid audio effects, from the chanting and yelling to the clang of weapons and screams of death, should please just about everyone with their high level of quality.Dynasty Tactics 2 has made some nice improvements over its predecessor. As not only is it better looking, more difficult, and infinitely more expansive than the original, its also more cinematic and open to improvisation as well. Die-hard strategy fans should definitely get a kick out of it (especially once they start to utilize all the secret goodies and items that are there for them to unlock). But for newbies who are just getting started on their way to strategy games, however, it may be a little too much too soon.If you're feeling adventurous and are up for a legitimately hard challenge, though, then Dynasty Tactics 2 is more than enough to keep you busy for quite some time. Even if some of its technical shortcomings chip away at its aesthetic appeal, it's hard not to recognize its more commendable merits.", "date": "Sep 23, 2003"}
