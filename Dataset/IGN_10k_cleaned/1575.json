That is, unless it's all for fun in a videogame. So maybe we're not teaching kids such great ideas that fire is nothing to take lightly, but those young enough to find this game fun probably are too little to know the difference between toying around with fire and really taking on the responsibility of being a fire fighter.   Features  Simple and educational gameplay for civic-minded youngsters  Five missions of fire fighting bravery, plus a bonus challenge Print the awards and medals you've received on the Game Boy Printer Only for Game Boy Color    Mattel's Rescue Heroes: Fire Frenzy is the first of a series of Rescue Heroes adventure games for young, young gamers. Unfortunately, it's not such a great start in the gameplay department, with some strangely confusing levels that force young gamers to fidget with the controller rather than learn to really play a videogame for the first time.  There are five missions plus a bonus stage in Fire Frenzy. The best of these of take some classic children's learning games and add some fire fighting elements. One is a simple Memory match game, matching two animals to save them from a forest blaze. Another is a re-creation of Simon challenging kids to memorize colors and motions and play them back to send signals. There's also a simple matching challenge at the beginning of every round that asks kids to connect colored suits and special tools together.  Those simple children's challenges are easy, but hold some promise for kids just learning how to play videogames. It's the action games that are a little disappointing, since they sometimes involve odd gameplay that's not explained in the manual or in the game's text. While the river Jet Ski save game is fun and very easy, the helicopter water drop is like a shooter but with some frustrating controls. The chopper moves side to side, and the water buckets are pretty tough for little kids to time at the edges when the chopper suddenly turns the other direction. And more confusing is the motorcycle rescue game and the linesman trench dig. There are all kids of trees and rocks to get through before you can finish your task, but the game never explains how to get rid of these things. Once you do figure out what to do with these barriers, it becomes a matter of fighting the poor control -- sometimes these objects can be knocked down and sucked away, and other times, the controls inexplicably do not respond. This is made much more a pain in the neck because, with the obstacles in your path randomly placed, the game sometimes stacks trees and rocks in hard-to-clear random angles and directions, making it tough to get into position to get rid of them.        Games made for little players often fail -- the heart just isn't in the design. Unfortunately, this kind of feels like one of those games. Sometimes it's vastly easy but still a fair challenge, like it should be, but other times it's uncomfortable to play and not so clear to understand.It's too bad that children's games just don't get the concentration of more adult games. Certainly the developers tried to do some interesting things with Rescue Heroes: Fire Frenzy -- there is a lot of very well done voice work packed into this small game. It also has a nicely designed difficulty structure, though the lasting play isn't there, because it doesn't save the best ranking times and give you a chance to better your score. Not that this could have possibly have been a universally great game for us all, but maybe with a little more work, the next Rescue Heroes game might be more fun for an audience ready for their first videogame.", "date": "Dec 2, 2000"}
