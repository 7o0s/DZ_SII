To their credit, Looking Glass developed Command & Conquer with all of the elements you want from a quality RTS. The problem is the genre in 1999 is much richer and more thorough than it was in 1995, which is when the N64 version of Command & Conquer was born. While the game plays fine and a good time will be had, it's tough to escape the feeling of delayed dj vu and and the feeling of loss from not having a multiplayer experience.  The Features  Includes all one player missions from the PC original, plus several special N64 missions. Only version to have full 3D worlds. Expansion Pak allows for high resolution option. Choose one of two opposing armies. Unique buildings, vehicles, troops for each army. 3D units and terrain. Unique fighting styles for each army.   The Common Units and Structures:  Minigunner soldier. Bazooka soldier. Engineer--used to take over enemy structures Commando--highly trained destructive soldier, high priced too. Refinery--gives you Tiberium, the ultimate resource. Silo--Stores Tiberium. Power Plant Advanced Power Plant--twice the power of a Power Plant. Communications Center--allows you to use a radar map. Repair Facility--fix your vehicles rather than replace them. Construction Yard--the cornerstone of every base. Barricades--sandbags, fences and walls keep the good guys in and the bad guys out.   The Story The story of Command & Conquer follows a typical good versus evil plan. The evil terrorist organization, The Brotherhood of Nod (NOD) is led by a figure named Kane, who is all about world domination. They're opposed by  the good guy-esque Global Defense Initiative (GDI) who are a super elite force backed by the United Nations. You can select either side for your army and wage war across the globe using a variety of highly trained soldiers and state of the art weapons. Remember though, each side is motivated by different concepts and this will be reflected in both their weapons and their fighting styles.  Gameplay When you send your first set of Global Defense Initiative (GDI) or Brotherhood of Nod(NOD) troops into motion, you'll notice how quickly and smoothly they get around. While your troops can never move fast enough when your base is being demolished, the truth is the N64 version of C&C moves a little faster than the PC original especially when you keep it in medium resolution mode. The basic one player missions will sometimes have you setting up shop, gathering and managing resources and digging in for an all out assault. Other times you will be given a handful of troops and a few vehicles and you're supposed to somehow whoop ass with this little force. While each presents its own set of challenges, we preferred the long drawn out, nuclear-weapon-building, full frontal fun of the former rather than the quick fun of the latter.  The controls for Command & Conquer are actually very easy to use once you get them down. You'll be moving, guarding and attacking with the greatest of ease after you get blown away early in the first mission, that is. The non-building campaigns where you are given a set number of units will really get used to the interface and give you a good feel for the game. You'll quickly learn that it's better to focus all of your fire on one target at a time and blast away until it's ashes before you move on to the next. Learning to make the most of the vehicles you have in these little missions is also important and we admit we're still not very good at it. There's something beautiful about using a whole flock of soldiers to clean out those big armored bad guys one by one.   It's when you have to dig in and set up shop for a deliberate they-know-you're-coming type of battle, that Command & Conquer truly shines. Managing your resources and doing enough to keep the bad guys (whomever they may be) off your back long enough to mount an attack is the essence of a real time strategy game and it's captured perfectly in C&C.  The confident general will have no problem deploying their construction vehicle that allows them to build everything and anything they'll need and then moving through the hierarchy of other structures that will produce their weapons and technologies of war. A look at the instruction book will be mandatory for those unfamiliar with the C&C franchise.  Knowing what buildings will allow for the production of which vehicles, troops and support buildings is key to being an efficient commander. Unlike StarCraft you don't have to be present at your ~home base~ to get keep your guys productive. You can be waging war on the other side of the battlefield and with a pull of the Z  trigger, you can pull up the menu that'll allow you to pick what you want your guys to build. However with building you'll have to float back over to headquarters and tell the chaps where you want to put the darn thing. Also your building icons are arranged in a way that only allows you to build one of a particular kind of unit at a time. For example you can be building a communication center, a tank and a bazooka soldier all at the same time, but you would have to wait for the bazooka soldier to finish before you could build a minigunner or another bazooka guy.  While there's not space here to discuss tactics too much, we can tell you that C&C demands that you use a balanced attack to accomplish your goals. Using a variety of soldiers and vehicles works best in most cases. Remember you can complete the mission in anyway you want, but to get those all important rating points you want to be swift and decisive with minimal losses.  The fun of the single player missions only made us yearn for the challenge of a multiplayer battle where we can match or new found skills against a worthy human opponent. Unfortunately there's none you'll have to be content just whooping on the computer A.I. This is the same artificial intelligence that falls for the same tactics over and over again. Using one guy to draw their attention and pouring in through the old back door is always a favorite, but it does get old after awhile.   The N64-only Special Ops missions are well thought out and add a nice novel element to the game. There's two each for both the GDI and the NOD that are quite challenging. The progressive nature of each mission will require you to use all of your skills as a commander to get the job done. In one scenario you have to use a solo commando to take out a handful of soldier and knockout some surface-to-air missile sites. With this done you can then order an air strike that will clear out the NOD's evil Obelisk of Light laser tower, very nasty. Then you can finally begin to set up your base so you can get to your real mission of whooping those evil Noddies once and for all. Very cool.<br .  Sound The mission briefings are well done and add a lot to the game. We had a major problem with the part of the briefing that showed a poorly animated B-actor flapping his gums while we heard and read about our upcoming mission. Other than this, the computer woman's voice was soothing and a little arousing at times as we imagined her waiting for us back at HQ with her. . . . nevermind. Her voice was clear and stood out above the battlefield noise that got pretty hectic at times.   The battlefield noises are great. You can hear little soldiers dying in agony as they eat hot grenades, shot with rockets and squished by tanks. The squishing is especially gruesome since it sounds like nothing we've ever heard. When you sic your ground troops to attack a structure all of a sudden their machine guns kick up a few decibels as they level buildings. Must be those special wall crushing bullets that pack that extra bang.  Graphics The look of C&C is both hit and miss. The miss is that the units look both blurry and simple. We've said before that the polygon count for an individual soldier might be in the single digits and we've seen nothing to change our minds.  Many times when we've selected a huge force of, say, 14 soldiers to go attack something, we'll include a couple of engineers in the mix so we can take over buildings. Once they start scooting towards their destination, it can be hell picking the little buggers out so we can go send them towards a building. Sometimes you can only pick them out by the hat that they wear or the blueprints/briefcase/thermos object they seem to be carrying under their arms. Very frustrating.  The smaller vehicles like the NOD attack cycle can be indistinguishable when it's sitting by itself. You almost need other craft around it that you know what isn't an attack cycle. The NOD Mobile Artillery crafts look and move like turtles but can be hard to pick out in a crowd of NOD Light Tanks. Similarly the GDI Humvees and Medium Tanks often get mistaken for one another in the heat of battle. All of this mistaken identity for both units and vehicles can add precious seconds to your decision making time and this can be very frustrating.  On the other hand, the 3D terrain of C&C is great. As you scroll along the exposed battlefield, because there is plenty of black fog of war, you get the sensation that you can see the curve of the earth rolling beneath you. Very neat. Also use the medium resolution mode otherwise you will suffer unbearable slow down. When we called in an air strike once on high res mode, the frame rate seriously went down to 5 fps. The high res mode looks very nice but it's just not worth it. The medium resolution is clear enough so you can hide guys and tanks behind trees and in valleys and they really are invisible to the bad guys. And the vehicles and soldiers interact perfectly with this environment. They go up and over hills and around corners and objects. While this full 3D world can make it tough to build walls and fences with any effectiveness, you'll gladly treat it as a challenge that can be overcome.  Control As we said the clever control is pretty good. Using the analog stick to navigate around the map is nice and intuitive but you'll have to be quick or double jointed to use the D-Pad, Z-trigger and shoulder buttons to execute the best commands. You can always hit down on the D-Pad to zoom back to your home base and a combination of Z and B to make your guys guard something. These are a little complicated but you've got to have them. Perhaps the best use of the N64 controller is the mapping of battle teams to the C buttons. You can assign huge groups, we never counted, of units to each button and then you can select them with a push of a button. Hold the button down, and the camera and icon will slide over to their location and you're ready to do work. You will have to master all of the controls to have success in this game and we have no problem with that. Command & Conquer is a fine game and may get a little addictive for anyone who never got into the PC version of the game. But for anyone who ran through the old version, the N64 won't offer much in the way of new thrills beyond the new N64 missions and the 3D world. If Looking Glass had taken this same engine and used original units, vehicles and concepts we would have a runaway hit on our hands with the first RTS on the N64. However  the stale taste of the old C&C takes a lot away from the current game even if it is breaking new ground on the console. The simple fact is, we've played this game several times, several years ago and while it was fun then, it doesn't hold the same thrill anymore. This is the main thing that keeps us from giving this one a higher rating. If you beat Command & Conquer on the PC 4 years ago, then you may want to pass on this one. If you've never heard of Command & Conquer before today, run out and get it now. If you fall somewhere between these two extremes, give it a rent and don't be surprised if you incur some late charges.", "date": "Jun 30, 1999"}
