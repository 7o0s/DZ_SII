Now, spotting the potential for variations on a winning formula, third-party Ubisoft has hatched the My Word Coach series for both DS and Wii and these games are focused on improving your vocabulary. They are simple affairs designed for anybody and really meant to be played in short bursts every day. Hop in, take part in a handful of word-based challenges, broaden your vocabulary, and shut down for the day. Good idea, and an undertaking that we highly recommend for our own Nintendo Team associate editor Mark Bozon, who wrestles with three-syllable-plus words frequently. The thing is, like the brain games before it, My Word Coach makes for a much better handheld experience than it does a console one, especially when you consider that the Wii build of the game retails for approximately $20 more than the DS version.  If you've played Brain Age before, you will already have an educated understanding of the concept powering My Word Coach, for it is very similar. The title, whether it's played on DS or Wii, is just as much a tool for teaching as it is a game, and this alone makes it an ideal candidate for parents hoping to steer clear of software with guns and gore. You use the Wii remote or stylus and take part in six-plus single-player daily word challenges, the majority of them fun, but not nearly as altogether-engaging or quite as polished as some of the minis in Nintendo's brain titles.   There's Missing Letter, in which you are shown an incomplete word and you must draw in the correct letter with the Wii remote or stylus. Utilizing the Wii remote to write in the missing letters feels far less intuitive than simply scribbling them in with the stylus, but it works. The Wii incarnation features a pioneering mode whereby you can actually wirelessly link the DS and use it to quickly input letters and this functionality works amazingly well; you won't even need the DS cart to do it. However, this option is not immediately available in the Wii game -- for some unfortunate reason, you have to unlock it first. Worse, though, if you want to play a second game of Missing Letter, perhaps to better your ranking, you will have to go through the wireless link setup process again, which is disappointingly unintuitive. Also, the title's letter recognition system is occasionally glitchy, enabling you to scribble in the incorrect letter and it will still pass. A little more time working on this fundamental mechanic would have greatly benefited the challenge.  In Word Shuffle, you are shown four definitions and must use the Wii remote or DS stylus to match the correct word to each of them. It's a very straightforward exercise. Again, the challenge feels more responsive on the DS, as you can simply slide words quickly and accurately with the stylus; the same process takes a little more finesse with the Wii remote. In Pasta Letters, you are shown a definition above a bowl of soup and you must quickly spell out the word that the definition describes using the pasta letters in the broth. And in Safecracker, you are shown a definition in the upper screen and must rotate the dial of a safe using the stylus or Wii remote to spell out the correct word. In this case, you twist Nintendo's remote as though turning a lock into a key, and it feels good.  My Word Coach ramps up in difficulty as you go along, but it doesn't start out easy. Even the initial testing process, meant to determine your knowledge level of vocabulary, features a dozen or so words that are bound to throw some buyers off. To the title's credit, after a few days with the product, we felt that we had effectively picked up several words, and continue to use them today. Therefore, strictly as a learning tool, we have to deem Ubisoft's effort a success. But as a game, it's not quite as engaging as we'd like. The DS version flows better than the Wii one, but the diversity in challenges is lacking in both. Furthermore, Ubisoft has made some frustrating choices regarding navigation of the Wii build's interface; rather than simply pointing and clicking with the remote, you have to twist the device to scroll selections, and you will inevitably find yourself under and over-shooting your desired challenge. I like the My Word Coach games and can easily recommend them to anybody who wants to improve their vocabulary. As a teaching tool, these are effective efforts, whether you are ~playing~ them on DS or Wii. Given the choice, though, I would suggest that you stick with the handheld version for several reasons. First, because using the stylus to scribble in letters feels much better than trying to do the same with the Wii remote. Second, the DS build features a couple of exclusive challenges that better the experience. And third, it's $20 cheaper. The Wii incarnation sells for the ridiculously high price tag of $49.99, which is just too much, in my opinion, for an offering of this type. For only $29.99, the DS version includes all the features of the console build and is more intuitively controlled.My Word Coach is a strong concept, but the overall execution on both DS and Wii is not quite on the level of Nintendo's brain games. I hope that Ubisoft will ready improved sequels next year that fully integrate wireless DS play on the Wii version, add several more varied challenges to both, correct some of the letter recognition issues, and throw in some form of online play for good measure.", "date": "Dec 15, 2007"}
