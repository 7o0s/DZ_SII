While it's nice to see the action as if it were through your own eyes, sometimes it's pretty cool to be able to see your character go through the complex motions of running, fighting and jumping. Unfortunately Reality Bites' latest third-person action title, Dark Vengeance, shows us that too much of a good thing can be very damaging to a otherwise solid game.   The storyline is pretty cool. A looong time ago the Humans were at war with the Elves. Just when it seemed sure that the Elves were going to wipe out all of humanity, a group called the High Council stepped in and laid down a badass curse. Basically they used a powerful spell to set it so that the sun would flamb every Elf it hit (If they could lay down magic that heavy it make you wonder why they hadn't done it a LOT sooner). Somebody tipped off the Elves though, and they were teleported to a dark isle where they could sit and plot their revenge. Skip to present day (okay, present day for the game). An eclipse of the sun has frozen in the sky and the Elves (now called Dark Elves) are rampaging the land getting revenge for all those years of darkness (Dark Vengeance... get it?). You, personally injured by the actions of the monsters are looking to stop the eclipse and get even in the process.  Unlike most third-person games, Dark Vengeance gives you a choice of three different characters to play - Nanoc the Gladiator, Kite the Trickster, and Jetrel the Warlock. The Gladiator, as you might expect, is a burly warrior who has access to the most powerful hand-to-hand weapons. The Trickster, Jetrel has several very fast attacks and great jumping ability. Finally there's the Warlock, a hideously scarred mage who has loads of distance attacks at his disposal. Each of the characters has their own basic advantages and disadvantages, and in the end, I found the three to be remarkably well balanced in their abilities.  One really cool thing about having three different characters is that they each can find weapons and items that are completely specific to their class. This means that you can play through the game three separate times and get a completely different play experience (at least in theory, I actually found the second play period to be a little tedious as I knew where a lot of the goodies were hidden on the individual levels). The Gladiator gets access to really cool looking weapons like the Fire Brand (a big ol' axe that 'burns' while you have it out) and the Phantom Edge (a sword that leaves a trail when you swipe it at your foes). The Trickster gets access to thiefish items like the flash bomb (which blinds everyone in the room for a few seconds) and complex gizmos like the cyclone, a weird fan that picks up enemies and slings them around. The mage really tops out with some cool looking effect items like the Staff of Dust (which absorbs damage given to mage but drains his mana with each blow taken) and the Transfusion Tines (this one's really cool  it sends out a bolt that steals an enemy's life force and then brings it back to you). Each of the items not only looks great, but is given to you in a way that lets you really take advantage of its powers.  So what the hell am I complaining about? Well, each of the characters in the game is big. Really big. This considerable largeness, mixed with the fact that the game's camera insists on parking itself RIGHT behind you, makes it almost impossible to tell where your enemies are, what objects lie right in front of you, or in fact to see anything at all. Don't get me wrong, when you get a glimpse at 'em, your foes look great. They move well, they fight intelligently, they even die with grace... Unfortunately you very rarely get a glimpse of any of it. This single problem turns what would be a really well made action game and turns it into an exercise in frustration. Need to make a tricky jump? Too bad you can't see where you're going. Need to find an item in a cluttered room? Better just walk over everything, 'cause you're not going to spot if it's in front of you. And I don't even want to get into the number of times I didn't even know that something was attacking me because it was standing too close to me. I like big beautiful characters as much as the next guy, but come on... I'd like to be able to see the game as well.  Dark Vengeance isn't unplayable. I managed to see most of the game, and would have had a pretty good time doing it if I could have seen what I was doing. Instead, I mostly stumbled around, yelled at the monitor a lot and pretty much made everyone around me miserable for two weeks. The multiplayer mode (which can handle up to 36 active players!!) was a little bit better as I seemed to be making most of my attacks from a distance (the camera actually slides into a pretty good position on some long shots). Unfortunately, there are just too many good action titles out there right now for this to be much of a consolation.  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Jan 12, 1999"}
