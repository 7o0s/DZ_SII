Nintendo marked the holiday by releasing five new titles for download to the Virtual Console, including the legendary Super Mario Bros., the cult classic ToeJam & Earl and the father of modern fighting games, Street Fighter II. Fans of the fight flocked to cash in 800 of their stocking-stuffered Wii Points and acquire Capcom's one-on-one brawler that day to play under the mistletoe. But many acted too quickly, and found not the gift they expected  that version of Street Fighter II was a lump of coal.It's not that the original Street Fighter II is a bad game. Just the opposite, actually  it's a solid, satisfying fighter that launched a new era for arcades and redefined an entire genre. The problem is that that first version is just too barebones of a release. Only eight characters, limited speed. As basic as it gets. It doesn't have the extra features, fighters and sense of energy contained in the follow-up releases that came later on in the SNES life cycle  releases like Street Fighter II Turbo.Turbo, now debuting on the Virtual Console itself, is an enhanced version of the first Street Fighter II. It takes the skeletal structure of the established design and fleshes it out in three key ways  character selection, moveset tweaking and overall speed of play.imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwiimedia.ign.com%2Fwii%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F800%2F800834%2Fstreet-fighter-ii-turbo-virtual-console-20070629062932615-000.jpg&caption=imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwiimedia.ign.com%2Fwii%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F800%2F800834%2Fstreet-fighter-ii-turbo-virtual-console-20070629062933255-000.jpg&caption=The characters available to play are the most obvious change, as the selection screen has grown from eight to 12 with the addition of the four big bosses  the heavyweight boxer Balrog, Spanish gymnast Vega, Thai kick boxer Sagat and cape-clad madman M. Bison are all now selectable in every mode. Playing as these guys was a huge deal in the early '90s, and hardcore SFII fans took to mastering their moves right away.The established World Warriors didn't go overlooked, though, as new special moves and tweaked controls helped to balance each of them out as well  lone woman Chun Li was given her own projectile fireball move, arm-stretching Dhalsim gained the power to teleport, and sumo wrestler E. Honda was blessed with added mobility and a new flying slam.And, thirdly, the ~Turbo~ in the name came from the newly-added speed adjuster. You could play Street Fighter II Turbo at the same normal rate as the original, or you could increase the velocity to ~turbocharge~ the gameplay  characters moved and jumped faster, fireballs flew more quickly. You get the idea.All of these upgrades served to flesh out the Street Fighter II experience, and made Turbo the game of choice for SNES owners a decade and a half ago. But, unfortunately, that doesn't necessarily translate to today's Virtual Console. The problem, again, is the same one Wii owners faced on Christmas Day  this version of Street Fighter II isn't the best one there is.Capcom released a grand total of four editions of Street Fighter for the SNES over the course of the 16-bit era, and Turbo is only the second of the four. After this game, Super Street Fighter II arrived and added even more features, four more new characters, and more balanced gameplay. Then, after that, the company developed a version of Street Fighter Alpha 2 that came to the Super NES as one of the system's final new releases in 1996 - and again, it was significantly improved over the versions that came before.So Street Fighter II Turbo isnt a bad game at all, on its own merits. The problem with recommending it is that, eventually, it will be rendered obsolete  just as it is itself rendering the Christmas-released original version obsolete with its own debut. Download Turbo if it was your favorite version back in the SNES days. Otherwise, wait for the later and better versions to arrive in the Wii Shop, or, if youre a multiple console owner, check out the HD Remix version set to launch on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 later this year.", "date": "Jun 30, 2007"}
