After playing the game for a few hours, it became clear that there IS NO REASON. C:COA lacks everything the movie did - ambiance, creativity, and fun.The Crow's closest analog would be Gray Matter's Perfect Weapon for the PlayStation. You're one 3D man who fights against multiple enemies on a bitmapped background. Ignore the graphics, and you'll realize that they took the Perfect Weapon engine to the Saturn and tacked on different texture maps and polygon models.The graphics in are a nightmare. The Crow was never good looking, but Gray Matter turns him into something that looks like a drunk mime with a stick up his butt. Your enemies are no better. Who wants to fight against a faceless man in coveralls? Everybody looks like the walking dead, and the dialogue is C-movie quality. ~C'mere, you clown,~ indeed. Maybe it's just because of the movie's set design, but Acclaim's patented reverse-Midas touch makes everything forgettable.Gameplay is just as pathetic. Although your character has a fair number of moves, managing to line up with the enemy is nearly impossible. Since you find from fixed points of view, you'll often find yourself fighting a mob of people when you're looking at yourself from fifty feet away. Gray Matter put no thought into getting a good camera angle, much less wondering if it affected gameplay.There isn't anything more to say about the game except to avoid it like the shambling zombie it is and spend it on Die Hard Arcade instead.", "date": "Jan 7, 1997"}
