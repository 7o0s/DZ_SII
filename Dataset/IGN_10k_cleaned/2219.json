After the chaos at the EverQuest launch and the clumsy launches of both WWII Online and Anarchy Online, most people just decided that any MMORPG wouldn't be worth playing until it has been out for a month or so.  Dark Age of Camelot from Mythic Entertainment takes that perception and shatters it. From day one, the game has been stable with only a few minor bugs to cause players grief. Instead of logging on to find the servers down on day one, each was up and I was able to get right into the game with no problems.  The game actually has a story behind it, and its one that instantly drew me in. I'm a huge mythology buff, and to find a title that combines Celtic folklore, Norse mythology, and Arthurian legend is almost a dream come true.  DAoC takes place after the death of King Arthur. The land of Albion (where Camelot lies) is now in danger from raiding parties of two other realms. Hibernia is a magical land based on Celtic lore while Midgard is a rigid snowy realm right out of Norse myth. Each land has its own look and races that call it home.  In Albion, the choices are all derived from Humans, but come from different areas of the realm. The Britons are the people of Camelot, Highlanders are tough fighters, Saracens are dexterous men of the desert, while the Avalonians are the inhabitants of Avalon.  Midgard has a slightly more diverse series of choices ranging from the Norsemen, Dwarves, Trolls, and small blue Kobalds. On Hibernia you have Elves, Celts, the half-giant Firbolgs, and the tiny Lurikeen.   After logging into the game for the first time and choosing your server, you then must make a choice as to what realm you will play in. You can only choose a realm once, and if you want to switch you either have to delete all of your characters on your chosen server or go to another. When you log into your realm, you are then taken to the character screen where creation begins.  After you choose your race, you are then able to choose a face and hair color as well as a height (short, average, or tall) and sex for your character. Next you need to choose a class. This part is handled slightly differently than in other MMORPGs.  The class you pick at creation is now really the class that you will be forever. Each realm has a different series of paths to choose from. At creation, you choose one of these paths and then at level five they branch off in a couple different ways. For example, a Celt can choose the Nature path and become a Naturalist, but then at level 5 choose to follow a different path to become either a Druid, Warden, or Bard.  This way of character creation is actually a nice change from other games. It gives you a little time (five levels) to think before you choose what class that you'll be locked into for the rest of your career in the game.  Once you are in the game, the first ten or so levels of your life will be pretty familiar to you if you've ever played EverQuest. Combat is still the boring ~hit button, go get drink while monster dies~ form that most MMORPGs employ. This is probably one of the biggest problems in terms of the actual gameplay, and most people can overlook it due to the number of things that are done right in the game.  The best place to start is the interface. Your chat window is split into two halves, one handles mostly combat and loot messages while the other is for chat. Chat is then also broken up into different categories for groups, guilds, etc. This allows the window to not become cluttered or confusing.  There is a quick bar where you are able to place spells or skills, which can then be easily activated via a press of one of the number buttons on your keyboard. Also, the group screen is done excellently. Not only are you able to see your group member's health, but also their spell power and what spells are currently cast on them. Now you will no longer have to ask them how their mana is doing or whether or not they need any new buffs.  Another thing that is instantly apparent when you start playing is that the game is just as accessible to casual players as it is to those who stay up all night adventuring. You can play for an hour or so at a time and still get plenty done, getting enough items to feel pretty satisfied. Many low level monsters drop armor, and money comes pretty easily.   To keep the economy strong and good items rare and valuable, there is item decay in the game. Eventually your weapon, armor, and shield will become damaged and you'll have to take it to an NPC smith to be repaired, but in time it will become useless and you'll have to upgrade.  Not only that, but there have been measures put in the game to prevent ~twinking~ where a player with a higher level character will give one of their lower level ones a bunch of items to give them an advantage. When your character first enters the world, they will be limited to a certain type of armor and won't be able to wear anything better until they advance a bit.  Speaking of armor, each type is further broken down into smaller categories with varying degrees of toughness. Not only that, but each specific type of armor has a different look, so people who wear leather could have several different textures on their character.  From there you get to the skills and spell system. Combat types get varied types of skills and attack styles at varying levels and for different types of weapons. Each of these uses up a little bit of stamina, but normally do more damage than traditional attacks. And archery is actually a viable option in combat as some classes (such as the Scout) are primarily archers. In this game, you can actually make a kill using a bow, which is quite different than how archery is used in EverQuest (where it is mainly used as a means to pull a monster to you).  Casters get new spells just about every level (you don't have to buy them), and they range from offensive attack spells to defensive buffs and heals. And yes, there are pets in the game. Some casters can create huge stone golems out of clay to fight alongside them (complete with some very nice walking animation), enchanters get various pets and can charm, and even those from the Norse lands can summon pets in the form of the spirits of fallen warriors.   As for how the Realms interact with each other, you have to look at the geography itself. Each land has a ~home~ area where players are able to hunt, group, and live out their lives without the threat of PvP combat. Then there are boarder lands that connect the realms where huge battles take place. Imagine huge armies of players slamming together in a huge, and fast, PvP battle and you'll have a good idea what these conflicts are like.  The purpose for the PvP in the game comes down to the Relics that are held in each Realm. When you steal one of these and take them back to your Realm, there is a Realm bonus. You also get these points by killing someone of a rival land. This feature hasn't been fully explored yet as there really aren't enough super high level players to successfully pull off a raid to steal a Relic, but it is expected to happen very shortly.  Questing is also a big part of Dark Age of Camelot, and even this aspect of the game is better than in EverQuest. NPCs give out quests depending on your level, however sometimes you would have to perform a lower level quest to make the correct one appear. Once you do get a quest, some of them are pretty cool. For example, a level one Rogue quest in Albion has you running down the road to speak to a guard in front of a keep. He then gives you a letter of warning to take to two guards at a bridge close by. As soon as you hand over the letter a tiny army of skeletons and spirit hounds come over the hill ahead and you fight alongside the guards to repel the undead attack. And that is just a small level one quest!  Other quests such as those where you have to kill an enemy to get an item are also done well. Once you get the quest all you have to do is go and kill one of the enemies and the item automatically appears in your inventory. This way you don't have to run around for an hour and kill hundreds of copies of the same enemy just to find one little quest item.  Each Realm is huge. There is no zoning except when you go into one of the main cities or a dungeon, and the geography of the game perfectly matches the map that is included in the box. This is very cool, as the map is helpful in finding your way. Follow a path on the map, and it will take you where you want to go. If walking or running isn't your thing, then you can pay a bit of silver to ride a horse along a pre-determined route to another city, and there are even teleportation methods in the game.  Graphically, the game is a step above titles such as EQ or AO, but of course not quite as impressive as future titles such as Star Wars Galaxies. What is impressive however is the sheer amount of geometry that is being pushed around without causing your PC to slow to a halt.  The first time you enter a city in any of the realms, your jaw will drop. These are not small box-like houses as you would expect from EverQuest, but rather a huge sprawling city made up of realistic looking structures that make excellent use of the polygon pushing abilities of today's graphics cards.  Character models are decent as well, but there isn't a huge variety in the look of monsters at lower levels. In each realm, one model is used for multiple different creatures with the only differences being size and color. This changes a bit when you advance past level 10 or so.  Also, weather effects are done very well. Instead of rain just appearing and starting to pour down, it begins slowly and builds up to a storm that then gradually recedes. Its pretty minor, but is also a nice little atmospheric touch.  These graphics don't come without a price, as I wouldn't personally try running the game on anything less powerful than a GeForce. However with those cards getting down in price and quickly becoming the most used graphics chipset, it's not that big of a deal.  The final thing I really need to mention is a very minor part of the game, but it is extremely handy. When you log in to the front end there is a little option under the username/password fields called ~Quick Entry.~ This little option keeps track of your most-played characters and allows you to jump right in as one of those characters, completely bypassing the server selection screen.  The question remains, should you play Dark Age of Camelot if you're already into EQ or AO? Well, if you want a game that is familiar enough to get you into it, yet different enough to keep you hooked, the answer is a definite yes. DAoC takes some ~standards~ that MMORPG fans expect to see, expands on them with some great new gameplay and interface elements, and wraps it all up in an interesting story and world.  This game is something that the MMORPG market needed, and it is also one that I will be playing for a long, long time to come.   --Jeremy Conrad Want to share your opinions with the world?
