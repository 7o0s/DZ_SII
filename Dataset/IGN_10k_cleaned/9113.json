Graphics were in simple black and white, and there wasn't much in the way of mobile gaming competition to distract players from over indulging snakes with tasty morsels. Snake Mayhem 2 doesn't stray far from its addictive origins. Instead, it slaps on some new paint and a techno soundtrack, and relies on good will.    Not that that's a bad thing. Snake Mayhem 2 is packed with shake-fisting mazes for its art deco snake to navigate. Clearing each level is a simple matter of gobbling up all the ~bites.~ Once consumed, a goal portal appears that ships you off to the next stage. The catch, of course, is that the more you eat, the longer your snake grows and the more difficult it is to maneuver without eating your own tail. The only way to combat this is to swallow three of the same-colored bites, which aids your digestion and keeps you trim. Completing three-of-a-kind chains also boosts your score.   To prevent Snake Mayhem 2 from turning into a straightforward gorge fest, levels are laced with a variety of pickups that release point bonuses, slow or increase your speed, and grant limited invincibility. There are also teleportation squares that wind up being handy ways to keep your bonus meter filled (it's a time-based bonus) or avoid the roaming enemies that eventually pop up to hinder progress.    Snake Mayhem 2 is more about your reaction time than strategic foresight, although it's essential to plan movements a few steps in advance since snake's steering resembles a tank more than a sports car. On top of that, the fun, new ~revolutionary~ animated backdrops mostly distract from your quest to not die (while racking up a high score).   Unlike its predecessor Snake Mayhem, the sequel only offers two modes. Trip guides players through a series of progressively difficult levels with minimal handholding. Arcade is a straightforward play until defeated mode, allowing players to set the stage and difficulty.    Snake Mayhem 2 does a commendable job replicating the addictiveness of the original Snake, while renovating the exterior trappings. If only those animated backdrops weren't so distracting.It may be lacking in actual mayhem, but that doesnt make Snake Mayhem 2 less enjoyable. In fact, its rather addictive in short sessions  although more out of frustration from ramming into walls than an actual desire to wrack up a high score. If youre a Snake aficionado, eat your heart out.", "date": "Sep 27, 2007"}
