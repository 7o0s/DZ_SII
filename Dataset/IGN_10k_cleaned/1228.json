It's 14-10, my Vikes are up on the Rams, but a costly interception with less than 30 seconds to go in the first half has me in serious danger of losing my lead to a young lady from the ATL a mere three games in to my Online NFL2K1 career.  But we'll get back to that later.  I'm sure with all the ground I've got to cover, the last thing you want to hear about is my nail biting 4th quarter finish.  Right?  Right.  After nearly a full year of waiting for Sega to deliver of its promise of true Online gameplay via the Sega Dreamcast, NFL2K1 is finally here, and truth be told, you really should stop reading this review right now, because you've got better things to do.  Namely, hopping online and trying your best to avoid getting your tail whipped by yours truly.  Sure, this game has its issues, and we'll get to that, but if you're short on patience, lemme break it down for you:  If ever there was a must-own sports game on any console, NFL2K1  is that title.  Unless you're some sort of fun-nazi, this game will rock your world.   *Ahem*  That said, allow me to kill the color, hop down out of the booth, and get right down in the thick of the trenches to let you know exactly why you owe it to yourself and to Sega to pick this one up.  Believe it or not, a lot has changed since last season that has nothing to do with the aforementioned ability to go head-to-head on the 'Net, and the vast majority of these changes are for the better. I'll try to give you the run down as quickly as possible, but be forewarned, there's a lot to go over.  This could take a while.    Let's start with the game visuals.  The front-end has kept with last year's look, but all of the menus and overlays were re-done in high-res, and they look pretty sweet.  Getting around in all of the game's different modes is still a snap thanks to the system, and even the playbook got a nice over-haul, including player numbers on each play preview (making the need to check your receivers at the line less necessary), have been added.  Some of the overlays look a  bit sloppy, such as the four corners between plays, but on the whole, the gravy graphics are all-good. Not exactly T.V. level production values, but passable, nonetheless.  In-game, Sega has obviously done a lot of work here, and some of it has paid off.  The models are certainly more articulated, with more realistic shoulders, arms, and textures that stretch with movement. It's also true that many new details have been added, such as the much ballyhooed ~shiny helmet~ effect and more detailed texture work, but in some ways, the game suffers a bit here in comparison to last year's version, and you can tell that VC struggled getting in all the details they wanted within the confines of the game's engine. The game often slows down just a bit (from a solid 60 to like 55  it is tiny, guys, but noticeable on occasion), and the game seems to have trouble smoothly swapping out the models featuring different level of detail, and the awkward transitions look downright ugly at times. I'd also have to say that the grass textures look like crap this year.  Last year's version was much more crisp and lifelike, whereas this year is a bit washed out.  The lighting and texture-work on the players is obviously better, but the game ends up looking a bit less crisp in the end.  Thankfully though, the extra work Visual Concepts did on animation makes the game look much more lifelike in spite of this PAL-esque look on the field.  Several hundred new moves have been crammed onto the GD-ROM, and even compared to Madden on the PS2, NFL2K1 has the most varied, natural looking collection of moves any football game has ever seen.  Last year, you could sometimes get lucky and have a defender bounce off, but this year, you can count on tons and tons of animations for broken tackles, depending on player types and styles, as well as a host of new animations on the offensive and defensive line, where play has really picked up.  We'll get more in-depth on that later, but let's just say that as far as in-game graphics are concerned, the game has some short-comings, but on the whole looks a lot better than last year's effort, thanks to the animation.  There's just a lot more to look at, as it were.  And I'm not just talking about the gameplay.  As promised, Visual Concepts has added a great deal to the game in terms of extras.  Think of the difference between NFL2K and NHL2K in terms of options, multiply it by ten, and you've got a good idea of how much is here this year.  The franchise mode is alive and well, and while it isn't as in-depth as EA Sport's program, I messed around with it for a few seasons, and playing through this thing looks like a lot of fun, and will certainly add a lot to the replay value.  You've pretty much got full GM control, and can offer up trades for other teams to approve or decline, as well as draft and develop rookie talent over time.  You can also sign, cut, and develop players during the season and do a lot of moving and shaking during the off-season.  On cool aspect here is that we pulled some major trades for fun, like moving Marshall Faulk over to help out the 'Niners, and his performance dropped off a bit without the line-play he benefited from in St. Louis.  Not that seeing him get smashed by blitzing LB's was cool, but when I checked my roster and looked at his player stats during the season and saw his player ratings fluctuate due to said erratic performances, I was really impressed.  Little touches like this abound in the Franchise mode, and though the stat tracking is not quite as detailed as it could have been, on the whole, it is a great addition, and adds a lot to replay value.  I did have one gripe here, though.  For some reason, a few Season Mode features do not work in Franchise Mode, such as the Sports Ticker and post-game reports.  You're still playing a season, though, and all stats from all games are being calculated.  It makes absolutely no sense to cut these functions out, and kind of takes away from the appeal of franchise mode, as during the season, I love to keep tabs on other teams.  It makes it seem like more of a races, you know?  As it stands, Franchise mode is cool, and offers a lot, but they should have offered complete season features in terms of presentation make it a complete package.  Most of the other presentation bells and whistles are conveyed not in what you see, but what you hear.  The audio in 2K1 does a lot of neat stuff. The crowd boos, cheers, and gets pumped up on a player's cue, and there is a lot of chatter this year.  Players will shout taunts at offensive performers to try and rattle you, certain stadiums have personalized celebratory signals, such as the cannon sounding after a score in Tampa Bay, and once again, Peter and Dan are back in the booth, and Michelle is still wandering the sidelines looking for a clue.  The commentary seems a bit less plentiful and active than last year, but there also seems to be a lot fewer repeats, and the guys are still as funny and insightful as last year.  And yes, just in case you were wondering, you still ~can't coach that.~  A very solid job here. Also, I gotta give the guys props on the new intro movie.  A big jump over last year, and it really gets your juices flowing.  The rest of the notable improvements are all in the gameplay department, so I'm just going to hurdle over that awkward transition and start get down to the business of examining the heart of 2K1, playability.  So much has changed here, I don't even know where to begin.  The game still offers the same basic controls, and if you've played NFL2K you will be able to hop right in and pick most of it up as you go but, in honesty, so much has changed that it will take at least a few games to come to take advantage of all of the games new control options.  VC took about 90% of the complaints about last year's version to heart, and threw in a heap of their own complaints and really managed to hammer out a polished gameplay engine in almost every imaginable area.  Take passing, for example.  Maximum passing returns, but outside that, it's a whole new ballgame.  Instead of the fast and slow floater used to represent bullets and lobs last year, the game now has three primary pass types: a true bullet, lob, and a normal pass that falls somewhere in between.  While you can still lead a pass, QBs aren't automatic again this year, and depending on how they stand up to pressure in the pocket, performance will vary.  Warner will thrive off the blitz and eat you alive, and a QB like Kitna will almost always get into trouble or miss his mark a bit, making the receiver's job a little bit more difficult.  Pump fakes are now as simple a doubletap of the corresponding button, and that has done wonders to the overall feel of getting the defense to bite and making a key pass that takes advantage of a misstep.  When I think about it, there is actually nothing coming to mind to complain about here.  In light of all this, I'd say 2K1 has the best passing game in football that I've ever seen.  It's realistic, responsive, and much more intuitive than any other game out there, and is just one of many major changes to an already-excellent system.  However, not every aspect of 2K1 came in as a leader, and Sega knew this.  The running game caught a lot of slack last year because people would say anything from it was non-existent to impossible to stop, but the bottom line was, it was problematic, and Visual Concepts took multiple steps to make sure they wouldn't fumble the ball on 3rd and short this season.  Backs now fall under two specific styles, power and finesse, and depending on said difference, certain plays will work better and worse, and certain moves will make runners more affective.  A stiff arm or shoulder-drop from a strong back like Bettis will give you cause damage, but try that stuff up the middle with a Warrick Dunn, and you'll get creamed.  Take him outside and try to dance and you'll make your opponent wish he hadn't brought the house through the middle of the O-line.  Beautiful.  They've also made the stiff-arm a less than sure thing this year, as is the hurdle, and the charge really makes a difference.  Throw in the addition of a juke move that you can actually control and an auto-hurdle move to get past defenders who have already hit the ground, and you've got a player-control package that is difficult to complain about as well. The running game just flows.  Once you learn what moves to use when, you'll really start feeling like you're down there on the field, and every last decision becomes that crucial twist or turn that could break a big play for the score.  It is really, really tight, gang.  Trust me.  This is due largely to the fact that the game's blocking scheme has totally changed.  Just like last year, following blockers is a must, and thanks to the added reality of up-field blocking, the occasional major run is a lot more common with the game's better runners, and it really opens up possibilities for everyone this year, not just for those who know how to run.  This really helps in the area of Online play, which I'll touch on later, but the way this change was implemented is probably my second-biggest problem with 2K1.  The problem is, when a defensive player gets a certain distance from an offensive player without the ball, regardless of the angle, the defensive player gets ~sucked in~ to a block, and getting away from said block while controlling a player is damned near impossible without bull-rushing yourself downfield.  Now, that's all well and good when you're blitzing the QB, but what about when you're trying to lay a migraine on some weenie receiver and you can run away from a block to run him down, even though you're slamming on the opposite direction on the analog stick?  That's called holding folks.  Sure, ~people get held on every play in the NFL and it doesn't get called,~ but does every player get held on every play?  And must it be the player I'm controlling, every damn time?  Sorry guys, but a balance of the complete lack of active block pursuit in 2K and the new ~I'd rather die or cost my team a down than let you run after a guy who's clearly already beaten you by 10 yards~ thing this year's blockers have going is a must for next year.  As it stands in 2K1, I often felt cheated out of plays, and it really sucked.  It all boils down to an animation problem, really.  All they would have had to do is reduce the active collision area to start the blocking loop, and things would have been fine.  But when I have an angle on a guy and turn my back on him to get in a shoving match just so your running game can be a bit more realistic, I am not going to be happy.  Bottom line. After a while, it gets to the point where you just start trying to suck defensive players into blockers, weaving your own little flytrap on aggressive collision,  and while seeing Carter lay out Law as Moss steps for 6 does make me smile, I wish that it wasn't so hard for me to reach out and make a grab at a passer-by every once in a while, even if I miss.  I understand you can't let every block be shrugged off at will, but there's got to be a balance between keeping me at bay and holding me back. Ya feel me?    Speaking of the receivers, not much has changed here folks.  The on-field markers that made 2K famous are still here, and still crucial.  About the only change here lies in the fact that timing routes are now much more important.  Hitting a guy after a cut is so much more important, or trying to confuse a defense with cross routes.  All of that stuff is more important, and you'll find route running comes into play big time this year.  Stop and Go's, comebacks, plays off the Bump and Run, it is all conveyed quite well. The fantastic catches are also toned down a bit, which is also nice.  My only knock is you'll still occasionally drop an easy catch that hits both hands on offense, and if someone doesn't find a better  way to convey a flubbed catch by next season, I will be forced to break some controllers. Still, it happens a lot less this year, and with the new strategy found in plotting routes and reading the D, pass reception gets the go-ahead for the first.  And yes, just in case you're still awake, I said ~Bump and Run.~  The offense wasn't the only thing that got tuned this off-season.  Pass defense is a lot different this year, and with the addition of true Bump and Run coverage, this aspect of the game has changed a lot.  Covergae does some funky stuff at times though, and it seems the best VC could do to convey the difference between good players and bad players is to have the bad ones play like complete morons at times.  As a result, some routes and some plays can be way to easy against some teams for several runs until they manage to get a hint. I've had players in the Minnesota secondary who were the only player near the ball stand and watch after a ball was thrown because they were outside their respective zone and had low ratings.  I don't care if I can't make the play, but any defensive player worth his salt will go after the ball if they are watching the play, even if they react to late.  But how many defenders do you know that will see the ball thrown, then walk away.  not to get better position or anything, just because.  It only happened once or twice in a season, and the best DBs will play it smart, but more so than any other in-game situation, the actual pass coverage seemed oddly inhuman at times.   I will give the it this, though. Players do key quite well on repeat plays, and they react very realistically to them.  Mismatches are conveyed beautifully, and you'll see your defense learn to double Terrell Owens in the endzone, or see them start throwing single coverage on Thigpen if the offense is thriving off George. By the same token, I have seen more than one triple team thrown on Moss by lesser teams in an effort to stop the bleeding.   Also, I love the improvements made to pass defenders ability to catch the occasional bad pass.  Unlike last year, you rarely drop an obvious interception if you try to catch it, and depending on where you are standing, you'll go for a pick or a bit in a much more natural way.  Even if you try for a pick, the way 2K1 conveys a receiver going up over a defender is just plain awesome. I hated both last year, as they just didn't look possible at times, and happened far too often.  That has been toned down a lot this year, and despite occasional lapses in sane coverage, the DBs come out improved.  But for those of you who like a bit more versatile brand of defender, playing linebacker has become a bit more crucial this year.  Due to the aforementioned ~sticky~ blocking, it is almost a must to play back in the LB corps, checking any major breaks in the run while keeping an eye out for the pass.  Nothing major has changed here, but it wasn't really broken in the first place.  The one major area of improvement here is definitely in the behavioral AI.  Blitzes and stunts are much more complex, and much more realistic.  Not only can you take advantage of the extra time coverage affords, but the pressure in the pocket is much better, making scrambling, reading coverage, and following blocks all more crucial on offense.  Nothing like Blitzing Plummer and watching him throw it away as you send him to the turf.  What a wuss.  You really feel the heat as a Quarterback this year, and even more so as a defender.  As I mentioned in previews, playing the defensive line is just awesome.  Not only has VC added a whole mess of new moves like swims and spins, and getting after the QB with a Kearse or Randle is so much more fun.  The defensive line AI is also pretty friggin' good, and will try to bat down passes more often, even if they are pump fakes, and even if you can't handle the full control of this new mini-game, Sega has made it so that you can use simplified versions of the control if you want.  In the end, this is easily the most improved area of the defensive game, and compliments the passing game quite well in terms of making the game much more demanding of the players.  Awesome stuff.  Am I forgetting any skill positions...let's see......nope.  Oh, wait.  The kicking game.  I know, who gives a rats' ass about the kicker, but it has changed, and so I guess I gotta mention it. The kicking game is a little bit trickier this year.  The meter now moves from side to side a bit, and you have to try to line both the horizontal and vertical aspect of the kick, and it adds a lot to the tension behind each field goal.  Last year was basically automatic on both sides, but with this new mode, even the computer will miss even the most seemingly automatic kicks every once in a while, and it really makes this part of the game seem more realistic.  That about covers the positions, but I should also mention some of the little things 2K1 does that make the overall gameplay cool.  Weather now really affects the game.  In one game, Priest Holmes fumbled the ball twice in the latter half of a wet and wild squeeker that I barely walked away victorious in.  receivers were sliding trying to make cuts, jerseys got muddy...it was just cool.  And this year, penalties are really a factor.  They'll happen at random, to both you and the computer, and the occasional offsides or pass interference can make or break a drive.  I had one big play from Faulk get called back because of a clip today online, and even though it had to suck for my opponent, it was cool to go to the replay and point out the infraction.  The developer made sure that this sort of stuff was implemented intelligently, and for that, they must be given their props.  It's the first time I can honestly say a video game has ever done that on both sides of the ball, and for that, and it really ads to the level of realism.  Two things though, VC.  There's a difference between a block to the back and a clip, and don't make the player I am controlling jump offisdes for me.  Cheap.  They did make it so that if one player jumps and you save the penalty, another player will try to make it happen anyways, which is quite hosed, but what can you do.  The overall effect is just killer.  The overall game speed is faster too, and this effects everything from making an open-field tackle to the time you have in the pocket. I am also a BIG fan of the overall AI, which is now a good bit harder on Pro, the middle difficulty setting.  I could whip it pretty hard last year, and now that setting gives me a good game almost every time, and beats me on occasion.  I won't even talk about how embarrassing All-Pro is right now.  Lastly, let me say that the playbooks are the bomb.   Each team has its own special slant, and whether compared to the competition or standing on its own merit, the game really shines here.  The design was very deliberate, and you really have to learn your team's plays and in turn, its players to be effective.  Well done, guys.  Keep it up.   My only major knock on gameplay outside blocking in this year's game is player switching.  What happened here?  The game determines not who is closest to the ball, but rather which player can cover the distance between the themselves and the ball-carrier. To top that off, if a player is engaged in an animation, like a block, the game skips him as an option.  Combine this with the game's blocking issues, and it can get REALLY messy.  VC tells me it is the most advanced algorithm for determining the best player to make the play in video game football, but here's my beef.  As I am not Rain Man, I am not smart enough to take advantage of it. No human being I know could possibly anticipate who they'll be getting with this game at times, and here's why:  Can you memorize how fast every player on your team is?  On top of that, can you keep track of which players are involved in some sort of abnormal animation at the same time?  Well, if you want to know who you'll be using at times in 2K1, you kinda have to.  Otherwise, you will often end up getting a guy on the opposite side of the ball carrier than the one you expect (I always look for the guy closest to the ball), and dive in the wrong direction as a result of the split second timing and decision making needed to make a tough tackle.  Hell, sometimes, you'll have a guy in the backfield, and the first option the game gives you is 20 yards deep in the secondary when 5 players are within 5 yards away.  Say it with me class ~UN-AC-CEPTABLE!~ As long as you have an open line between you and the ball, you are fine, but if anything gets in your way, you're kinda out of luck. The end result is you learn to rely on the computer to make hits for you in most situations, and you'll soon find that rather than feeling like a participant in the game, you'll feel like a spectator. Not nearly as much fun as being the wind beneath your team's wings. You have to figure out something more predictable for the end user, Sega.  Pleeeeaaaaase?  That about covers the single player game.  If you haven't sworn off the English Language after that rant, I'd be more than happy to give you the dirt on the game's shining star in a sky full of lights, Online play via SegaNet.  We had to wait until the game shipped to get this aspect in, but I am happy to say that after popping in a boxed copy, the wait (the entire year following the DC's launch, mind you) was well worth it.  Gang, I've played a lot of Online games on the PC.  A lot.  Quake, Starcraft, EveryQuest, you name it.  Chances are I've played it on my modem, or at the office on a T1, or snuck into the computer lab during college to experience the glory that is a T3, and despite all my experience, nothing has prepared me for the glory that is NFL2K1 Online.  Absolutely nothing.  Forget what you know about modem-based gaming.  The NFL2K1 experience will irrevocably redefine your definition of Online play, and you'll have an absolute blast while allowing it to do so.   Connecting can be quirky, sometimes taking 2-3 attempts (which Sega assures us is merely a result of last minute stress tests before the official Sept. 7th launch of the network), but once you get on, everything is easy.  Pick a region, find a server, and challenge a player.  The lobby system isn't perfect, but it certainly servers its purpose.  I would have liked it if Sega would have included a player's latency in the pop-up challenge window so I could see what I was getting into before I said yes to a game, but outside that, everything was surprisingly painless.  Once I got in the games....wow.  A game of NFL2K1, with or without SegaNet as an ISP, works like a charm.  I tried it out with Pacbell, Earthlink, and SegaNet accounts, and each game was incredibly smooth.  Obviously, there is a bit of a delay for input, but never a gap in input or visuals.  PC games like Quake will sometimes ~skip~ due to latency and players will seem to teleport around the screen, where 2K1 remains smooth and visible throughout.  You do have to make decisions a bit earlier Online than in the single player game, but once you get used to the timing, it becomes second nature.  I'd compare the latency in 2K1 to a ping of about 70-90 in an FPS title, which basically means you notice a delay, but it rarely effects gameplay.  Even at its worst moments, which are usually between plays on the post game retreats to the huddle or after a kick, the game runs like a game with a 150-200 ping, and that still ain't bad for a modem, considering I am lucky to get that on DSL at times.  I played a ton of different games over the past few days, and man, I am surprised at the consistency here.  Games with multiple players went as smoothly as games against one other user (but to the guys who used the Titans against me last night...you'll want to stop blitzing from the corners so much.  I ran you UP!).  I only had one disconnect against a guy from Texas who went by the handle of Legacy, and that was when Sega took the servers down for a last minute adjustment.  Even when you do get a bad patch of lag, a wait of about 10-30 seconds usually fixed things, and the game was back on track.  Throw a Dreamcast Keyboard into the mix, and it is just like sitting there next to another player, gang.  You simply have to go buy one if you don't have it.  I met so many gamers today while playing.  It's really cool to get to know people as you play, and to talk trash after a big play.  And the best part is, even with all the regional servers Sega set up, I still got great pings.  I was connected at around 28.8 most of the time here at work, and it played just as well against players in Florida and Atlanta as it did against people in L.A. and the Bay when I was at home connected at 33.6.  Simply incredible.  If this is where Dreamcast gaming is headed, sign me up, Sega.  Stellar, stellar job, people.   Man.  There's just so much to love about this game. Visual Concepts improved just about every aspect of the game, and though there is still lots of things they could do better, if you love football, you'd be hard-pressed not to love NFL2K1.  The single-player experience makes last year's game look like a joke, and when you factor in how flawlessly Sega has pulled off Online play, this is one game Dreamcast sports fans simply cannot do without.  And before I get hundreds of e-mails about the final score, 2K1 is better than last year's version by far in my opinion, but in light of the competition this year, I would have to rate last year's game a bit lower. I still think it is the best football game I've ever played, and that it is impressive, and that it is the best football title coming out this season, but the bar has simply been raised this year...Oh yeah, just in case you were wondering about that game against my female friend ~americancutie,~ she learned a lesson all my opponents got wind of the hard way:  Respect Randy, or my Vikes will dog you.  28-17, baby.
