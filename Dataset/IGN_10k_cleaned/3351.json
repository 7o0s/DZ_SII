These games fit the system so well since they're really made to play in quick shots. Namco produced a wonderful series of games with Namco Museum and Pac-Man Collection for the Game Boy Advance, and I seriously had high-hopes for Midway's own retropack since the company reproduced several of them very well on the Game Boy Color unit a few years back. Man, the development team responsible for these ports really need to go back to the drawing board...each of the four games in Midway's Arcade Greatest Hits has something absolutely wrong with them in terms of gameplay. And when gameplay is what the original games had going for them two decades ago, it makes the whole package of classics nearly worthless. Features Four Williams arcade games: Joust, Defender, Robotron 2084, and Sinistar Only for Game Boy Advance  Take, for example, Joust. The version created for the Game Boy Advance is quite possibly the worst recreation of the normally-outstanding arcade game released 20 years ago. In the game, your task is to bounce on the upper part of opponent buzzard riders with your ostrich before they do it to you. But when you've got imprecise collision detection, the gameplay is completely thrown out the window. The sprites seem to have an invisible barrier drawn five or more pixels around them, so the sprites never actually touch during the game. And the platforms to land on extend more than five pixels beyond where they're drawn...so you can quite literally stand in mid-air. With this wonky collision, some gameplay strategies are thrown out the window. I have yet to stab the pterodactyl in the mouth (which I could regularly do in the arcades), and the arcade's belly-flop ~bug~ through the platform gaps on the right side of the screen cannot be performed at all. Worse, this version is a single player only conversion...which is absolutely a travesty for Joust fans everywhere. If the GBA version was actually fun to play, I'd comment how the developer could have made the game single cartridge link compatible, or at the very least, single system two player using the D-pad and L button for the first player, and the A, B, and R buttons for the second. But since this game is not playable by any means...  Then, we've got Robotron 2084. Honestly, this conversion turned out the best out of the four games in the pack. But for whatever reason, the development team said ~screw this~ with the original controls. Sure, it's tough to recreate the two-joystick controls on the handheld, with one joystick used for movement and the other to fire in an independent direction. So, the only option available to you is to fire in the same direction as you're moving, or, by holding the B button, fire while standing completely still. Uh, what about another button to lock the gun in one direction while you're moving in another?  I'm wondering if the controls could have been better if the L, R, A, and B buttons were used for Up, Down, Left and Right directions to simulate the other joystick...but since this option isn't made available, we'll never know. The game is still a bit fun, but the gameplay doesn't seem to be the same...the Brainiac guys don't zap the humanoids as quickly as I remember them doing in the arcade, for example.  Next up to bat is a somewhat faithful version of Defender...with difficult to see graphics and slowdown galore. It's amazing to see a two-decade-old game actually slowdown on hardware that's several years advanced from the original system. The sound also suffers, as the engine noise isn't recreated at all in the Game Boy Advance version. It's just so difficult to see the enemies and bullets on the small screen that this conversion is extremely frustrating to play.  I didn't expect much out of the GBA conversion of Sinistar since the game requires a vertical-situated monitor and an analog joystick to emulate properly...and, yes, the GBA version is pretty bad. The original game required the player to zip around a sector of space, shooting asteroids to collect gems that can be converted into bombs. Enemy ships are out to do the same thing, but the gems will be converted into parts for the evil Sinistar creature. The controls have been simulated as faithfully as possible on the GBA's eight-way joystick (compared to the 21-way joystick of the arcade), but the play window is severely limited. You honestly can't see that far ahead of your ship at the oncoming ships to shoot, which is especially necessary when Sinistar comes zooming through to ~eat~ your craft. Another gameplay flaw: gems actually disappear after a few seconds of floating in space unclaimed by any ship...as far as I remember from the arcade version, these gems would continue to float around until they've been picked up. The game has the familiar digitized samples of the arcade, but they've been muffled almost beyond recognition.  Midway handed the conversion of these games to Pocket Studios instead of the studio that's handled nearly every conversion of Midway classics for every system: Digital Eclipse. I don't want to get into the politics of why the publisher went this route, but I will say that it was a mistake. Midway's Greatest Arcade Hits could have been a great compilation pack for the GBA...after all, Joust/Defender produced for the Game Boy Color was a great 8-bit conversion of those two games. The same can't be said for this edition which could, and should have been better than what was already released.", "date": "Jan 1, 2003"}
