Thanks to the increased horsepower of our test handset (LG's VX8000), we're now playing a downloaded version of what looks outrageously close to an N-Gage game. And we have the N-Gage game right here to prove this claim.   We've already reviewed previous editions of the game, from the workhorse Sanyo 8200 version to the far superior Series 60 edition, but Asphalt: Urban GT 3D on the VX8000 is by far the cream of the racing crop. The game has what the other version lacked: a sense of speed. In fact, when you jam the nitro, you really feel the car lunge ahead.   Asphalt: Urban GT 3D is also a very full game. Not only does it feature multiple tracks and licensed cars, such as the Audi TT Roadster and Saleen S7, but it offers multiple play modes. The Evolution mode is the meat of Asphalt: Urban GT 3D, as you compete in a series of races to unlock new automobiles. And not every car is the right one for the job, it may take multiple races to discernt he best wheels for the job. Asphalt: Urban GT 3D also includes quick races, time attack rallies, and a Cop Chase mode where you must radar leadfoots.   As mentioned above, Asphalt: Urban GT 3D looks great. The licensed car models are fantastic, and it's a nice touch to grant the player new paint jobs. The tracks --which are plentiful -- all bear a distinct look. There is no mistaking Las Vegas for Chernobyl. And these tracks are chock full of traffic, but without the slowdown that usually accompanies extra on-screen elements. The textures are not as good as the N-Gage or Nintendo DS edition, but it's quite close.   The biggest complaint we have with Asphalt: Urban GT 3D is the controls, which still don't feel as tight as we would like in a racing game. Turning just feels too iffy, but it's not a problem solved with the thumbpad that cellphones continue to ship with. When you're burning up to a jump ramp, you'll curse the lack of finesse when you oversteer to the point of missing the ramp entirely and ramming your ride into a wall.   Our other gripe is the lack of an engine sound. Asphalt: Urban GT 3D is a racing game, yet Gameloft opted to go with looping music -- none of it offensive -- instead of a throaty engine noise. We would have definitely preferred leaving the music to menu screens, but then again, if gameloft wasn't able to recreate a decent engine sound on the handset, then maybe it was for the best.Asphalt: Urban GT 3D is one of the stars of the V CAST launch line-up. There is a lot of game here, from instant races to the cop chases, guaranteeing that you get your money's worth. The control is slightly off-putting, but with practice, you'll certainly get the hang of it enough to enjoy the game.", "date": "Feb 3, 2005"}
