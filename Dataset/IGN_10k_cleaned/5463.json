{"name": "Kingdom Hearts V Cast", "name_review": "Kingdom Hearts", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/02/03/kingdom-hearts", "text": "Disney Mobile contacted IGN Wireless this morning to let us know of two updates for Kingdom Hearts coming in the very near future. One, the development says the camera problems will be addressed in a patch to be released in the next few days. Two, an additional level will be released in the next 3-4 weeks. Subscribers will receive a text message alerting them of the new level download, which will be free of charge. As soon as both of these have been released, IGN Wireless will revisit the review for further updates.   -------------------   Kingdom Hearts on a cellphone. It's hard to imagine, but there it is, right on the V CAST download menu. Go ahead, pinch yourself. But after this review, we're pretty certain there will be some loyalists that want to pinch us. Because no matter how cool the concept of playing a 3D Kingdom Hearts on a handset is, the execution is too short -- and in the face of other V CAST games -- not as refined as we had hoped the final version would be.   Born of an unlikely partnership with RPG masters Square-Enix and Disney, Kingdom Hearts tells the tale of a young boy named Sora who teams up with Mickey and Goofy to defeat the Heartless, a race of shadowy beings, well, without hearts. Using the Keyblade, Sora must vanquish the Heartless and restore the Disney universes to their better days.   Kingdom Hearts is played in downloadable chapters. The first chapter runs the spiky-haired Sora through a series of movement tutorials that are good to run though just to get an idea of the control layout. The thumbpad is no substitute for an analog stick, and the turning controls of Kingdom Hearts seem to demand just that. Pressing to the side to turn and then pressing up to run when facing the correct direction isn't fun in Resident Evil and it's not fun here, either. The tutorial also teaches you how to jump, lift and throw objects, as well as climb trees. Most controls are context-sensitive. When you approach an enemy, the ~OK~ key becomes the attack button. When you walk up to a chest, the ~OK~ key becomes the open button. In addition to exploration and combat, Sora also has magic spells. Depending on your handset, control schemes can be re-mapped to your liking.   Once you pass through the tutorial, you'll find Sora on a deserted island. Sora needs to assemble a raft to get off the island -- thus ending the chapter -- so it's up to you to explore the beaches, coves, and crags to get the parts. There is a kite puzzle that lifts you into a watchtower. A lava-filled chamber where death comes from a single misstep. And a collection gig where you must uncover four altar gems. All good stuff, but we just wish there was more of it. Because as it is, even the most mildly seasoned gamer will blow through this download in under an hour. And that's just not enough game play.   Another problem we have with Kingdom Hearts is the camera, especially in combat. If you ever fight more than one Heartless, the camera seems to delight in only showing you Sora's position and one of the enemies. The other Heartless are free to move out of the frame and attack with near impunity. It's frustrating, to say the least.   Kingdom Hearts, though, still looks great -- even all these months after playing the early build. Sora's model is well detailed with a recognizable face and outfit. The Heartless move and dance like they did in the PlayStation 2 version of the game. The island and its surroundings are colorful, and the use of color is fantastic. Kingdom Hearts really pops off the screen. The audio is excellent, too, with good sound effects such as the clash of the Keyblade against heartless flesh and little musical flourishes when objectives are created or save spaces accessed.  Kingdom Hearts' first chapter is just too short -- and when it's over, it's over. There will be additional missions up for download in the near future, but there is no firm pricing scheme in place (the next level will, however, be free of charge to subscribers) -- so who knows how much you may end up paying to complete this adventure? So, even though this opening mission is great, it's just over too soon for the download price.However, if you are looking for a showcase game for your new V CAST phone, it's going to hard to beat the impact of Kingdom Hearts. You're playing an extension of a PS2 franchise on your cellphone. That's undeniably cool.And as future installments are released, I'll be back with more details on whether or not it's an adventure worth continuing.", "date": "Feb 3, 2005"}
