Lately, though, his work tends to get pigeonholed into B-grade classification. But contrary to what the playa haters have to say, the guy's got talent. Like any average putz could've done a fraction of the stuff this artist's managed to find time for in the last decade. Stop frontin' and give the Iceman his props. If Bruce Campbell can get away with working the CD-ROM circuit, than the OG's certainly earned himself a shot at video game immortality right here and now.  And boy what a debut Mr. T (not to be confused with ~Whatchoo talkin' bout foo~ guy) has made. After disgruntled consumers hounded industry types for the better part of a decade to create a title based on psionic powers, Monolith's finally stepped up to the plate. Using the versatile LithTech engine as a backbone, Seattle's finest has created a one of a kind action/adventure that dares to defy description. Equal parts DreamWeb, Chaos Engine, MageSlayer, and Magic the Gathering, Sanity's a seething cauldron of creativity that's ready to boil over. All right, maybe it borrows a leeeeeetle heavily from cheesy sci-fi action flicks, but you can't refute the product's amazing approach to the world of espers.  Let's not get ahead of ourselves, however. Before we begin, let me introduce you to Cain, a rather large African-American male known for his psionic talents and piss poor attitude. This lucky chum's an agent who's been trained from birth to combat superhuman criminals. Because Cain's got a problem keeping civilian casualties to a minimum, an aggression control chip has been implanted into homeboy's brain that'll shut him down in an instant if mom, pop or little Billy is accidentally whacked. So, like uh, don't kill anyone unintentionally, or at least wait until they've given you a nasty look as a go ahead. And can you guess that this caveat's gonna make for a Rosie O'Donnell sized pain in the butt when the gray matter starts flyin'. Some people just don't know how to get out of harm's way it seems.  Little else could've been expected though, since Cain's the errand boy for a bizarre government funded organization. Therefore you get to parade his surly butt through a series of fairly cut and dried, yet intriguing scenarios. In fairness, many of the missions show a spark of inspiration, even if it may be too sophomoric for some. For example, you'll be tracking a hotline queen through a trailer park filled with Deliverance rejects, smackin' down street gangs, dueling on rooftops with the hero's wayward brother, and questioning the lamest crew of local yokels to come along since the cast of What's Happening Now! While a cool method of conversing with the riff-raff's been devised (they can be sweet-talked, intimidated or threatened), the limitations of the social conscience of the game means you actually have to think around some situations.  PR reps have been talking up Sanity's combat engine for a while now, and with good reason; it's cool as Walt Disney's cryo chamber. Here's the deal. By tapping into the power of talents he's collected (displayed as cards), Mr. Bad Ass can let loose with incredible feats of mental prowess on the fly. These powers range from mundane to ~Son of a @&$#!, let ME try that~ and allow our anti-hero to shoot fireballs from his hands, summon columns of sticky sand, put up flaming shields, read the minds of others, push enemies into danger with an ethereal hand, and heal himself when the dirty work's done. There's something for everyone here, even if the freakin' battles move at such a frantic pace you won't get to try out every talent on display. Unbelievably, moderation does factor into the affair, since it's necessary to maintain positive levels of sanity by grabbing power-ups, which are encountered just frequently enough to save you from going over the deep end.  Mr. Magic Eight Ball says that lots o' fights are in players' future. We're talking big fights, little fights, and the superhumans-rip-the-living-crap-out-of-downtown variety. Most of the confrontations feel like light filler, though it's fun now and again to vaporize the two poor saps that think they can ice out a psionic master with baseball bats. But if the usual confrontations don't win any awards, wait until you see the titanic one on one mentally powered showdowns. I mean, come on, what's not to like about a friggin' real-time duel using 80 psionic talents against a foe that's equally, if not more, powerful? If RPGs could whip up spell combat this hot, I'd ditch my normal life for a pointy hat and wand, no questions asked.  Unfortunately, the on-screen entertainment's quality waxes and wanes. While Sanity strives to bring you the best of cheesy science fiction and non-stop action, it ain't all that and a bag of chips. For one, the world's not dynamic. Although the title projects an illusion of non-linearity, you're always limited to an area of small scope until a puzzle's solved, enemy defeated, or piece of information gained. Dialogue occasionally branches for humor's sake, rather than to add depth to the adventure. Ambushes are scripted, not randomly stumbled onto, so players can memorize level layouts and quickly undermine the game's difficulty level. And during melee, you're too rushed or busy dealing with freaky camera angles to exploit all the talents you'll collect to the fullest, which is a big disappointment.  Ah well, you can't bake a cake without breaking a few eggs [ed. note. It's omelets, Robespierre.]. Nor can you design a corny one-man army movie style presentation in any other manner as well. For every gorgeous display of lighting effects and mass destruction, there's a big, ugly text message written in a loathsome font unleashed on unsuspecting gamers. And for every time Ice-Cain busts someone's balls like a ghetto pimp, there's a line of pure poop that follows. Still, this guy's got a grapefruit sized pair. Shock gave way to belly laughs after he responded to an obese esper's offer to make him a general in her terrorist gang by shouting, ~you better lay off the cupcakes, 'cause the oxygen's not getting to your brain.~ Praise the Lord, brother, I couldn't have put it better myself.  Man, oh man, did I want to love Sanity until the end of time. Instead, I've had to settle for a budding relationship with a sexy lil' product that I can romp with all night long and still respect in the morning. Monolith and Fox did a bang up job on the title, proving that a concept once thought to be totally impractical from technology and design standpoints wasn't just possible, it was destined to be. On the single and booster deck enhanced multiplayer fronts, Sanity's a trip from start to finish, even if it's not perfect. Flaws be damned, this game's pushin' the kind of psychic character that'd turn Dionne Warwick and her special friends green with envy.  -- Scott Steinberg      Want to share your opinions with the world?
