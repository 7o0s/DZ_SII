Dancing is fun, people like to dance when they're too drunk to stand. Here's an idea: let's put bunnies and dancing together in a puzzle game on Xbox Live Arcade. The idea could have been fine. Heck, we've seen much odder pairings in the videogame world but it's the execution of Boogie Bunnies' core puzzle mechanics that are the game's true pitfall. It does nothing different from the gaggle of puzzlers that are already out there and the old playstyles that it employs aren't nearly as fun as we'd hoped.   The premise for Boogie Bunnies (or B-Squared as it's called around the IGN office) is essentially the same ~falling colored bricks~ that we've seen before but instead of bricks there are festively colored bunnies. And instead of dropping your colored bunnies directly down onto the stacks of others you have the ability to toss them from either of the two sides as well. It isn't a huge departure from the norm, but it's something. As you've probably guessed your one and only goal is to rid the board of carrot chompers before they can stomp their way off of a ledge. B-Squared tries to throw in creative mechanics such as red bunnies that explode surrounding bunnies or aqua bunnies that, when destroyed, cause the rest of the flock to do a little jig (no joke, they actually dance, hence the game's name) and up your score, but none of it is the slightest bit exciting.   As with other puzzle games, and typically XBLA games in general, there are multipliers to help you up your score a bit. But only one. While you can combo bunnies together it's too often that it happens totally by chance rather than by some strategic motivation. The only multiplier that actually comes into play is when the bunnies are doing their cute and cuddly dance number. And in case you were wondering, you unlock different dance moves with each subsequent stage. The weird thing about the multiplier is that you can cheat the system by launching pieces off to the side and therefore off the board until you get a matching color. Zuma roots out this problem by taking away your multiplier if you don't destroy a set of blocks with each launch; most other games of this type have closed boundaries.   Look at all the pretty bunnies! The single-player levels are split across three modes: arcade, classic and endless. Your playstyle won't change at all, so it really doesn't matter which you select. Multiplayer modes do fare a bit better, with cooperative local play and something that we think is supposed to be online adversarial matchups but that wasn't nearly as clear as it should have been. Co-op play is fine. You and a buddy inhabit the same three sides of the puzzle but you can't cross paths so you have to strategize with one another in order to be victorious. Playing online is a bit different as you and your friend take turns at taking out as many of the boisterous bunnies as you can. Whether the goal was to destroy as many bunnies as possible or to have bunnies fall off the edge during the player's turn, we have no ide. There was nothing resembling a tutorial for online play to teach us.   The final failing for the gameplay in B2 is the fact that you can't see what color piece is coming next. It's a huge part of the strategy in Tetris to plan your attack, to know how to organize a shot to coincide with the next. There's none of that in Boogie Bunnies. Too often you'll feel like you're aimlessly tossing pieces down a shoot in hopes that it will somehow turn into a combo. Not exactly ideal for this genre.   Sadly things don't remedy themselves when looking at the aesthetics. The bunnies are decently detailed to look as cute as they possibly can and their dance moves are admirable, I suppose. I'm not exactly sure what dancing bunnies should look like, but Boogie Bunnies seems as accurate as the next. Where it loses hope of being impressive or worthy of being on Xbox 360 hardware is the first time that you see the framerate struggle to stay locked at 30. Whenever there are several bunny-filled explosions going on the game strains to maintain fluid animations, often times altogether failing. It's a sad day when a game that looks like this with its low resolution environmental textures and cute, simplistic visual style can't hold its framerate. On the other hand, the aural offering will neither offend nor please anyone; it just sort of exists. Dont spend ten dollars on Boogie Bunnies. Xbox Live Arcade games are meant to be fun, cheap distracters from more hardcore game experiences but Boogie Bunnies is neither cheap nor is it fun. Its boring and unexciting gaming at its finest and should only be experienced by those so addicted to puzzle games that theyve burned through everything else thats out there.", "date": "Jan 16, 2008"}
