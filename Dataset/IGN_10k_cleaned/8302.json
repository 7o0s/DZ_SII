Last month's episode, Abe Lincoln Must Die! turned a corner for the series and finally started to offer up the zany, brainy experience we wanted. Now, with Reality 2.0, the series has delivered an even more satisfying adventure full of fresh new humor and challenging puzzles.  In this fifth episode Sam and Max must take on a vast virtual reality world run by an evil villain known as The Internet. Max is apparently still President but, apart from sending giant battle robots to settle the unrest in the Dakotas, he seems characteristically unencumbered by his political responsibilities. In the course of their investigation, the pair find that they must actually enter the virtual reality world and dismantle from inside.   The setting allows for all sorts of game-geek gags that touch on subjects as diverse as roleplaying chiches, technology obsolescence and beta testing. From gold coins floating in the air to Bosco's latest incarnation as a half-elven (literally) merchant to Sybil's increasingly irate customer service petitions, the whole thing really hits the hilarious high points of the video game industry. As before, there are tons of throwaway gags that you might miss if you're not being careful. Bosco's selling Hot Rump on his counter, Max thinks the respawn point is a place to make out, and four out of five dentists viciously attack a gumball machine.  While all the episodes have been full of humor, the recycled gags were already growing stale in the second episode. This time around, the game's writers have written new jokes to go along with pretty much every item in the game. From your first moments in the office, you'll find yourself clicking on every single object you can find just to hear Sam and Max's cynical, offbeat comments. Max's warning that ~If man does not learn from the doughnut box, he is doomed to repeat it~ is particularly hilarious.  The puzzles here start pretty much at the same level we've seen in the rest of the series. That is to say, ridiculously simple and obvious. Within the first half hour, you'll be confronted with only two puzzles, one of which actually solves itself during the course of a simple conversation. One of the people you meet as much as asks you, ~Do you want to solve this puzzle?~ Needless to say, solving this one isn't too tough.   Fortunately, the challenge level increases from here with a number of multi-part puzzles. None require particularly huge leaps of logic but they represent the most satisfying puzzles seen in the series so far. Sure, the limited number of locations and inventory items mean that the solution is usually right in front of your face but figuring out how to put the pieces together is as much a matter of thinking things through as it is a matter of trial and error.  Better still, all the puzzles you solve throughout the game are building blocks towards solving the final puzzles in the game. It's true that the puzzles in the other episodes build on each other but those in Reality 2.0 relate to each other in a much more logical way. Well, logical by Sam and Max standards at least. Seeing how puzzles you solved at the beginning directly contribute to the overall completion of the episode is very satisfying.      The final challenge in the game hearkens back to the earliest days of adventure gaming and, while younger gamers might not get exactly what's so funny about it, the satire is spot on. If you ever played those early Infocom games, you'll be right at home here laughing right along with Sam and Max's comments.  As with the others, this episode is over all too soon. It took us a mere two-and-a-half hours to complete this one but the quality of the experience is so much higher than the last few episodes, that you're not left wanting more. Unfortunately, the series still doesn't seem to be building to any meaningful season-wide arc. Max is still President of course, and the identity of the main bad guy is finally revealed here but the discovery still doesn't resonate with any of the events of previous episodes.   Visually, this episode is a welcome departure from the rest of the series. While you'll be visiting the same old locations here, their virtual versions are so exciting and lively that you won't even care about spending another few hours exploring Sybil and Bosco's areas. The vivid lighting and the intriguing geometry of each object really brings the virtual world to life. Max's brightly lit teeth alone are a great touch. Incomplete environments, floating pop-ups and weird circuitry backgrounds all work together to create the most striking visual design that the series has seen.  As much as we've looked forward to the musical numbers in these episodes, the one in Reality 2.0 is just awful. It's not good and it's definitely not funny. While the context of the song requires that it be a little awkward and stilted, it just seems flat and uninspired when compared to the War number or the hilarious Ted E. Bear song from the previous two episodes.  As before the quality of the score and the voice acting is excellent. The writing is undeniably good but it's the performances of the actors that really sell the gags.   Abe Lincoln Must Die! was a high point for the series in terms of humor and the first adventure to actually deliver on the promise of the initial episode. Reality 2.0 takes things a step further in terms of quality. The jokes and puzzles are much more satisfying than we've seen in the series so far. Our only complaint now is that there doesn't seem to be enough connection between the episodes. We're in the fifth of six chapters here and we still don't feel that the series is building to anything worthwhile in terms of the narrative. Even without the promise of a season-wide story arc, this adventure is well worth exploring.", "date": "Mar 29, 2007"}
