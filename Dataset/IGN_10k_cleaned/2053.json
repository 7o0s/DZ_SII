{"name": "Last Blade 2", "name_review": "Last Blade 2: Heart of the Samurai", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/08/02/last-blade-2-heart-of-the-samurai", "text": "Although the PlayStation showed off a few 2D fighting games and the PS2 will be starting something of a 2D fighting game line-up with Guilty Gear X and Capcom Vs SNK 2, 2D fighting fans know that the Dreamcast was the home of the best-looking and playing 2D fighting games.  Sure, only Capcom and SNK believe in the power of 2D nowadays, but there's no system that demonstrates the speed, animation fluidity, and depth of gameplay from 2D games than SEGA's white wonder.  This makes the argument in seeing either Guilty Gear X and/or Capcom Vs SNK 2 on the Dreamcast that much stronger for it would be altogether right if the one of the last Dreamcast games were either the beautiful Guilty Gear X or the fighter's dream sequel, Capcom Vs SNK 2.  Lost among these two fighting games is SNK's 2D weapon based fighter, The Last Blade 2: Heart of the Samurai.  It's easy to see why SNK's great weapon-based game isn't receiving much attention: it doesn't display the crisp and crazy visual style of Guilty Gear X, nor does it have the big name characters found in Capcom Vs SNK 2 (though surprisingly, Hibiki is in the line-up in CVS2).  That's really a shame because The Last Blade 2: Heart of the Samurai delivers all the goods - plenty nice visuals, interesting characters, cool style, and a depth of gameplay that rivals any 2D fighting game every made  and should, in the least, be given a good look before you pass on it for the another mediocre title.  Some may argue that there's nothing spectacular about another 2D fighting game and to the casual eye that might be true.  Then again, to the casual eye Martial Champions looks as good as Street Fighter Alpha and we know that's not the case. Unlike other genres that have a superfluous amount of developers vying for the top spot (i.e. sports genre), the 2D fighting arena is owned by two companies  Capcom and SNK.  Both companies have made superlative 2D fighting games because they realize that as wonderful as 2D hand-drawn art can be, there has to be a heavy amount of gameplay to keep players interested.  Mix the great gameplay elements and nice visuals, with great character variety and cool style, and you've got a game that can be appreciated by anyone, hardcore or casual gamer.  Last Blade 2: Heart Of The Samurai definitely displays this ~total package~ of a 2D fighting game.  Although we care as much about a story in a 2D fighting game as much as we care about the story in an Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick, it's pertinent to The Last Blade 2 due to the setting of the game.  Taking place in the late 1800's with Japan is the center of the story. Various fighters, ranging from samurais, ninjas, street fighters, and priests, lock into battle as they are drawn into an ancient ceremony that links the world of living with the undead underworld.  A portal between the two worlds has been opened and heroes seek to close it while others are intent on using this portal for their own means.  Yeah, it's a bunch of metaphysical and philosophical mumbo-jumbo, but the setting of the story gives us a unique style to the setting and the characters.  The 1800's were changing times as Japan tried desperately to hold on to their traditions while many tried to integrate with the changing styles.  This is obviously seen with the clothing of certain characters like Kaede and Kagami, who were very European styled clothing while other characters stick with clothing we would normally associate with Japanese culture.  Backgrounds also share this unique style as you'll see Europeans holding umbrellas under the sun and drinking while also seeing Japanese citizens shopping in the markets and conversing with each other.  This style lends itself to the characters, all of which have their own different abilities and attitude. The Last Blade 2 might not demonstrate the flair or wild art style as Guilty Gear X, but the game is far from looking bad. Animation is good, on par with the Street Fighter Alpha series, and the game never slows down for a moment  if it does, it's done so for effect.  Special effects of super moves are okay, but look a bit dated.  However, it's not exactly how they look but what they look like that makes some of the super attacks very cool to execute.  Most notable are Setsuna's ~Ultimate Continuation~ super attack where he shatters a square crystal into numerous pieces delivering slashing bloody damage to the opponent or Akana's ~100 Demon Sabbath~ super that summons a horde of devils and demons to stomp on you.  The super attacks range from being very cool to just plain wacky, giving each of the 16 selectable characters different abilities.  Moreover, a lot of style went into making these characters; if I ever get a chance to make martial arts movie with malicious ninja villain, I'm hiring whoever did the chilling voice for Zantetsu.  While there are certainly better looking 2D fighting games than The Last Blade 2, there are few that will match the depth of gameplay that starts off with choosing your play modes.  After choosing their characters, Dreamcast owners will be able to select from three different modes: Speed, Power, and EX.  Each mode has their advantages and disadvantages; none make any particular character more powerful than all. Rather, each player will find that a certain mode will work best with the way they play a particular character.  Speed Mode gives a character a ton of variation to their combinations, an overhead attack that must be blocked high, and the ability to perform a Combo Special, a sort of Super Attack that involves you pressing a specific button sequence with the right timing (think Geese Howard's Deadly Rave).  Power Mode should be pretty obvious, especially after using it; you deliver much more damage, you'll damage players even when they're blocking, and most of all, you can perform two different Super Attacks - a Desperation Attack and a Super Desperation Attack.  EX Mode mixes all the benefits of both modes but don't get hit too often in this mode because you take a TON of more damage.  Using a four button configuration, you have a light slash, heavy slash, a kick attack, and the useful repel button.  The Repel button is a useful play mechanic that takes some mastery in order to be used properly.  With the repel button, any attack, even Super Desperation Attacks, can be interrupted, allowing you a free attack on the opponent. Timing is key to the repel button, as it leaves you open for an attack if you incorrectly time the Repel a second before or after the attack.  While the gameplay modes and Repel mechanic make The Last Blade 2 stand out from other 2D fighters, there are certainly a ton of moves to master, numerous tactics to use, and crazy amount of combos to practice.  Even though the game is technically two years old, there's still combinations that I'm experimenting that will have me preoccupied for quite some time.  There's only a couple of flaws that detract from this great fighting game and like all 2D fighting games, the biggest is longevity.  Depending on the number of friends you can call hardcore 2D pugilists will determine how much playing time this game will get. The computer does an amiable job of putting up a fight, and of course being an SNK game, the last boss is legendary for being a cheap son of a bitch.  However, once you learn the pattern of attacks, you'll be able to beat him with little sweat.  There are a few unlockable characters but one of the big additions in the import version - the Hanafuda card game - didn't make the cut for the US version.  There are a few sound glitches as well, specifically when you defeat an opponent the music cuts off roughly.  Again, the fact that this game is almost two years old makes it look dated to the spectacular looking Guilty Gear X.  Where The Last Blade 2: Heart Of The Samurai shines over its gorgeous visual brother are deep gameplay techniques, a great cast of characters, and attractive style that we've seen in some of SNK's legendary titles (my kingdom for a true Samurai Shodown sequel in 2D!).  In these declining days of the Dreamcast, it's good to know that a game like The Last Blade 2 will keep most Dreamcast users busy practicing the wealth of play mechanics and theorizing their own combinations.  Perhaps if this title does well enough in the states, we may even see other 2D fighting games like Guilty Gear X, Capcom VS SNK 2, or SNK's beautiful Mark Of The Wolves.  But if not, I can live with the fact that the last 2D fighting game on the Dreamcast shined brilliantly like a newly polished blade.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDCLast Blade is a good game in a crowded field, and while it does stack up with the best of them, it ends up falling short because it just doesn't have the same charm and familiar characters that the bigger names in SNK's NeoGeo Pocket line-up do. It may be one of the most accurate fighters, but most of its innovations have been siphoned into Gals Fighters (which also has jumped a few programming hurdles and offers a less letterboxed screen and the fastest fighting gameplay on the system). However, the cast of fighters is deep, the game is fun, and the Gallery may take your entire lifetime to complete (it's like an Easter Egg Hunt in Chickentopia). You can't go wrong with Last Blade, but you could go even more right with SNK vs. Capcom and Gals Fighters. If you're still hungry for fistcakes after those two, dig into Last Blade.", "date": "Aug 2, 2001"}
