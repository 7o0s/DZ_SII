Chalk it up to the fact that as gameplay and enemy AI are becoming more complicated, it's tough to balance a game so that it's fun to play alone and still challenging enough with multiple players. Outside of a few recent experiments like Resident Evil Outbreak, co-op gaming has been low on many developers' lists. Most cooperative games seem to take the guise of dungeon hack'n'slash RPGs with randomized levels and a focus on stats building -- which is why Nintendo's little four-player experiment is so refreshing. Like the GBA link-up quest it's based on, The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures is a unique take on the action adventure genre. It's because unlike the increasingly generic ~kill all rats in the basement~ quests of its RPG brethren, Four Swords Adventures dares to challenge players to think. And somehow, it pulls off an entertaining brand of cooperative gameplay that has you laughing with your friends, laughing at your friends, and at the same time learn to hate them more than the boss at the end of the level.Features Hyrulean Adventure mode for 1-4 players Shadow Battle versus mode for 2-4 players Action adventure set in 2D environments reminiscent of A Link to the Past 24 stages in eight areas 10 battle stages Eight unlockable mini-games Huge bosses and familiar enemies from previous installments in the series Many classic Zelda items, including the bow and arrow, bombs, and the boomerang Formation change system in single-player mode Adjustable handicap settings for all modes Game Boy Advance and GBA Cables required for multiplayer gameplay Progressive scan (480P) supportThe best way to describe Four Swords Adventures is to say it's four-player A Link to the Past, minus the overworld. All of the gameplay and technological advancements the Zelda series has seen over the last years are thrown out of the window, and Nintendo takes players back to the days of 2D. Some may call them ~good, old days~ -- others will no doubt lament that they're essentially playing a dated looking game on a powerful console. But there is no denying that there is a certain charm to going back to the flat worlds of old and once again think two-dimensionally. For example, if an enemy is on top of a hill and you're not, there is no way to take him out by shooting an arrow or boomerang at him. But don't mistake the absence of three-dimensional space for the absence of three-dimensional puzzles. Ironically, it's the one platform that's still firmly rooted in 2D gameplay -- the Game Boy Advance -- that adds another dimension to the experience.Like the presentation, the game's story takes cues from A Link to the Past. The evil wizard Vaati, who kidnapped the shrine maidens in the GBA Four Swords is released upon the world by the power of Shadow Link -- and it's up to you, Link, to vanquish the foes and rescue the girls again. Using the famed Four Sword that splits our hero into four differently colored Links, the Hero of Time sets out on a series of adventures in familiar and new environments, battles big bosses, and destroys magic barriers on the way.Gameplay in Hyrulean Adventure, the main mode in Four Swords Adventures, takes place both on the TV screen and on the Game Boy Advance. As a matter of fact, if you want to play this game the way it was meant to be played, you need to find some friends who own GBAs (and cables). Four Swords Adventures is really the first game to prove that Nintendo's whole connectivity spiel is more than just a scheme to sell more hardware. Every time a player enters a house or cave, or descends into an area that's physically below the area shown on the TV screen, the action moves to the GBA. The switch is seamless, since the graphical presentation matches the look and feel on GameCube. Likewise, conversations with non-player characters all take place on the small screen, leaving the TV clear of text bubbles and messages -- and, more importantly, the action flowing and uninterrupted.When playing alone without a GBA, the GBA screen is simulated on your TV.  It may sound a bit odd to be switching between looking at a TV and at a handheld, but in practice, this all comes together beautifully. One player could be chatting with an old man inside a house, trying to get a clue on where to go next, while two players are trying to solve a block puzzle inside a dungeon below. The fourth player could be digging up the yard with a shovel, trying to collect some cash. Sure, you still have to wait for everyone when you want to exit an entire area to move on to the next, but you're no longer locked in place while other players are having NPC conversations (like in the other big GBA connectivity game, Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles, for example). For more information on how the game works with four, three, or two players, check this article here.  But freedom to move about independently is just one perk of this system. Unless players work together and actually talk about solving puzzles, they will never get through some of the later missions. Take for example, a walkway in a cave, leading over a dark chasm. There is seemingly nothing to the right and nowhere to go. However, a perceptive player will find a second cave entrance outside that provides a different viewing angle on the area. Player 2 notices eye switches lining the wall to the right (if you don't know what an eye switch is, you need to play more Zelda games) -- but he can't shoot them because they're out of range. The solution? Player 2 tells player 1 to shoot an arrow off into the darkness to the right. Player 2 notes that the arrow impacted too low and tells player 1 to move up slightly and shoot again. Repeat until the arrow finds its target. Brilliant! Another area has players divide up roles and try to deliver some water-filled pots to an area engulfed in flames. Now imagine that only two of the four guys have the ability to jump -- throw a broken bridge, rolling boulders, and some bouncing enemies into the mix, and you can see how cooperation and division of labor is the only way to get through.But the greatest puzzles tend to involve the old Light World/Dark World theme introduced by A Link to the Past. Using a Moon Pearl, players can open Moon Gate portals and gain access to the Dark World which, you guessed it, sends them to the GBA screen. While in the Dark World, players appear as dark shadows on the TV screen and vice versa, players in the Light World appear as shadows on the GBA screens. Since there are subtle differences between the two worlds, Dark World players can sometimes move past obstacles or trigger switches that cause changes in the other realm. Listing more examples would be spoiling the fun of figuring it out on your own, but let's just say that there will be moments where players in the Dark World have to come up with innovative solutions to get their buddies past the next hurdle.All this is backed up by an intelligent item system that makes it much easier to just pick up and play the game. For starters, temporary items carried by players no longer disappear from their hands when leaving an area. You could conceivably carry a rock from the foot of Death Mountain all the way to the top (not that you would -- you'd want to slash some Tektites, right?). And unlike other Zelda games, Link and his clones start each new level without equipment. There is no continuity -- each stage is treated as a new adventure. You may find a boomerang in one quest, you may not find one in the next. Furthermore, you can only carry one item at a time. If you have the hammer, you'll drop it if you want to pick up the Roc's Feather, for example. While this does affect the overall coherence of the adventure and turns Four Swords Adventures into more of a collection of dungeons or side quests than a traditional Zelda adventure, it makes for the perfect multiplayer experience. Players will start to divide up roles naturally, asking each other to hang on to certain items and, depending on their choices, could make the adventure harder for the entire group by not bringing a helpful tool, or one player could get an advantage over the others and get his hands on more Force Gems.When the camera zooms out, the graphics look nice and crisp.  Which brings us to the dark side of Four Swords Adventures, and why this game rocks so much. It's got a mean side to it. One minute, you will work with your friends and try to overcome a tough puzzle, the other you're running your buddy down on horseback as ~payback for earlier.~ We dare you to be civil at all times. It ain't gonna happen. You will toss your buddy off a cliff for comedy. You will sprint for that big gem and all friendship will be forgotten. You will get annoyed at a straggling player, pick him up, and carry him to the exit. When you're the only guy with a boomerang and you see a cache of gems on the other side of the river, we dare you not to snicker. What's even better is that the game really encourages these moments. All too often, everyone is asked to collaborate and step on four switches or light four torches at the same time, and then one giant Force Gem will fall from the sky. Just one! Even better, at the end of each quest, players are asked to vote (secretly, on their GBA screens), which player annoyed them the most, and which player helped them the most. Players are then ranked according to how many gems they collected (it's the moment of truth for everyone, as a lot of collecting is done in secret on the GBA screen), how many foes they vanquished, how often they fainted, and then, how many players voted for and against them.  Along with the quest-based setup, this turns Four Swords Adventures into a game that you can play to just have some fun. Sure, you'll still want to forge on to uncover the next area, but it's just as fun to replay a stage to see if you can beat your friends to the number one spot. And if the roughly 20-hour main mode with its 24 quests in eight environments doesn't last long enough for you, there is also a collection of eight unlockable ~Tingle's Tower~ mini-games ranging from horse racing to Cucco catching, as well as a separate versus mode for two to four players. Called Shadow Battle, this mode is basically Link Deathmatch. Knock out your opponents before they get you by using everything from your trusted sword to secret traps. Power-ups include a thieving chicken, a carrot that calls your horse, and of course plenty of bombs. In typical Nintendo fashion, the game's not over till it's over. Even defeated players can still affect the outcome of the battle by clinging on to their still battling opponents or triggering trap doors and bomb chain reactions to cause some major damage. Don't expect something as deep and varied as Super Smash Bros., but with 10 maps and plenty of different strategies, it's definitely a worthy addition.Which brings us to what isn't so hot about Four Swords. The game suffers a bit from ~it's the best of Nintendo, it's the worst of Nintendo~ disease. As clever and balanced as the gameplay and puzzles are, the presentation seems to completely ignore that games have evolved in the last 10 years. All conversations are text-based, cut-scenes are handled by basically zooming in the camera close (which makes the graphics look worse than they really are), and the beloved Zelda tunes are played back using outdated midi samples that any $60 Casio synth could crank out. I hate to sound like a broken record, but a company of Nintendo's size can easily afford to hire a small team to provide some anime cutscenes to tell the story and give the musical presentation a shot in the arm by hiring a quartet to play through Kondo's and Wakai's greatest hits. Heck, even a new set of instrument samples might do the trick if it isn't willing to say good bye to midi just yet. As bad as the storytelling and the overall presentation are, the quality of the compositions is once again top notch, though. Hearing some of the classic themes paired with the right environments is enough to get any self-respecting Nintendo fan to break out the old consoles again.Graphics are a mixed bag. On one hand, the system throws staggering amounts of particles and enemy characters at players -- the amount of movement shown on screen at once alone is impressive -- on the other, the low-res artwork just doesn't hold up when the camera zooms in close, especially on big-screen TVs. With four players running in different directions, everything looks wonderfully sharp, but the moment they're close together, we're back in SNES territory. Or, more accurately, ~almost~ in SNES territory -- when have you ever seen someone set fire to an entire meadow on the SNES or witnessed hundreds of gems fall from the sky after a successful battle?Finally, the game simply isn't as strong as a single-player experience. Though Nintendo did a remarkable job at balancing the game well enough so that it's enjoyable alone as well, it just doesn't conjure up the same levels of excitement when you're solving puzzles on your own. When playing alone, you control all four Links at once. You can choose to align them in four different formations (which is necessary to push large objects or trigger multiple switches at once) or split them up and switch back and forth to overcome some of the objectives that require cooperation in multiplayer mode. It still plays well, but it isn't nearly as elegant when you have to constantly switch characters. And since each quest stands on its own, the game can't capitalize on that sense of building excitement and accomplishment that inevitably accompanies discovery of a new item or area in the traditional single-player Zelda games. Still, if you love the dungeon and temple elements in the series, Four Swords Adventures is absolutely worth picking up as a single-player game as well.Players who imported the Japanese Four Swords will notice that one of the three gameplay modes is absent from the US release. ~Navi Trackers,~ a narrated scavenger hunt for one to four players (with GBAs only) got the axe due to localization difficulties -- and because it just wasn't very good.One final word of caution: Nintendo neglected to add an in-game save or resume function. That means, if one of the players' GBA is running low on battery, you're screwed. Unless you get to the end of the stage, you risk losing all progress you've made in the level. Likewise, if someone accidentally pulls out the link cable (which isn't that tough to do, considering how annoyingly short they are), it's game over. It's confusing why Nintendo didn't add an automatic pause/resume function that kicks in when a player is disconnected.As a Zelda fan, you have to own this game no matter what. But if you can satisfy this title's steep multiplayer requirements (three friends with three GBAs and GBA cables), you're in for a real treat. Four Swords Adventures is really the perfect multiplayer complement to the existing Zelda titles -- and a must-have for die-hard fans of the franchise. Whether it's bumping into familiar enemies and characters from virtually every game in the series (including Wind Waker) or the huge collection of recognizable tunes, Four Swords Adventures has got fan service written all over it. Everything that makes the hearts of would-be Links beat higher is here. You will swim, you will dive, you will hide from giant bombs, you will climb Death Mountain and forage into the Lost Woods, you will jump, shoot, and slash, you will toss your tools into a fairy well (and I mean this literally -- this isn't some dirty euphemism), you will curse at a Tektite and get swallowed whole, you will cut grass and burn it, Hurricane-spin and sword beam, push and pull, lift and hammer down, run and slam, ride a horse, squint in the dark, run from Floormasters, and you will fight more enemies at once than ever before. And there will be chickens. Lots of chickens. There are many special moments for returning Zelda players in particular, such as when floor tiles start to spin and come flying at you. ~Don't worry, I know how to do this,~ the expert is bound to say. Then the game will suddenly start hurling other pieces of the level at the stunned group as well, and everyone is on a level playing field againWithout an overworld to tie the entire experience together, Four Swords Adventures feels a bit more episodic than previous games in the series, but even so, there are so many memorable moments that it's easy to forgive the simpler setup. Unlike RPGs like Dark Alliance or Champions of Norrath, this isn't about item variety, barter, and stats building. Four Swords is one devilishly laid out collection of puzzles after the next, bolstered by some good, old-fashioned action. It would have been nice if the technical side of the game would gave been more up to par. Polygonal levels and characters in the vein of the two aforementioned RPGs or would have gone a long way, even if the disconnect between the GameCube and GBA presentation would have been larger. Or, at the very least, the developers could have spared us the blurred sprite close-ups. But even with these limitations, Four Swords Adventures remains a shining example of connectivity done right. It succeeds where Crystal Chronicles failed, providing a solid reason as to why four player should go through all the trouble of hooking up four GBAs to their GameCube. Some things are meant to be for your eyes only -- and in the absence of online gaming on the platform, this is the way to do it. Another strong entry into the Zelda series. Go get it if you meet the multiplayer GBA requirements -- and get ready to hate your friends all over again.", "date": "Jun 2, 2004"}
