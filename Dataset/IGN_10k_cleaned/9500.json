See Disney titles sell, and it sometimes seems that a developer doesn't care to improve on a title that sells no matter what. Artificial Mind and Movement has developed The Suite Life of Zack and Cody: Circle of Spies, and it's actually a noticeable improvement. It shows what happens when developers put work into their franchise games: they turn out just decent, instead of totally crappy.   Circle of Spies is very similar to its prequel, Tipton Trouble. The game is still a 3D, on rails platformer, but there are some major differences that expand the title. It would appear A2M actually looked at what parts of them game were bad, and decided to change them. In fact most of the things listed in our review for the last game are thankfully missing from Circle of Spies. Kudos to the developers for making the effort because it really improves the title, but it's a shame that some of the changes are equally as bad.   The biggest difference is that Zack is actually useful this time around! In the previous title the twins were essentially one character split into two parts. Zack could jump, and Cody could do everything else. This time they can both do a variety of things, like jump and attack enemies, but each twin also has his own special skills that come in handy.   A few small tweaks have completely changed the entire feel of the game, and for the better. Last time everything was so disconnected. Players just ran in one direction with one character until they hit a roadblock, then just switched characters. In Circle of Spies, the focus is on completing the levels together. A new option is to link the twins together, so that they will follow each other until they reach a bypass. The areas the boys separate in are usually pretty confined, and require a constant alternating between Zack and Cody to get past. Overall the game's pace is vastly improved by the change.   This time Zack and Cody travel outside the Tipton Hotel. Both Zack and Cody gain new abilities through the use of upgraded equipment and new gadgets, so the game becomes even more diverse as it progresses. Some of the abilities, like the lock picking feature are not very fun, but luckily things like that end up being more of an optional game choice, used mostly to collect hidden objects.   The actual platforming elements are decent, but it's nothing spectacular. The level design is very cliche, with floating platforms and death pits (in a hotel?), but the level's strength lies in its alternating pathways that allows both twins to work through the same area together.   Circle of Spies does suffer in the presentation department, though. While the developers did not include awkward looking screenshots, they did put in some rather crude drawings of the cast. We know Zack and Cody are identical, but using the same photoshopped layer for the facial expression makes them look like the Children of the Damned.   Gone too are the first person boss battles, which were more of an act of tedium than anything else. For Circle of Spies, the missions are capped off by one of three minigames. Thankfully none of them require blowing into the microphone until the player passes out. However, they're still not any good. The Balance and Air Hockey games are some of the poorest controlling minigames we've seen. Seriously, online flash games play better. The Balance game has players use the touch screen to try and keep an increasing number of packages in London or Maddie's grasp while they try to avoid bellhops. It's nearly impossible to keep the package from falling, but thankfully players only have to keep one to finish the game. Air Hockey is much easier, but is a slow, overly fractioned bore. Can we think of a better minigame here people? Every DS game does not need Air Hockey, especially if it's not going to be done right.   The minigames can all be played multiplayer, though they need multiple game cards. The developers actually stuck in Wi-Fi capabilities too though. Players can hook up with friends or just anyone and play Whack-A-Ghost over the internet. It's great that A2M put the work into getting the game online; we appreciate the effort on the underused ability. However, it's a bit of weird title to put online. We tried to find somebody to play with, but weren't surprised to see nobody biting. First enough people would have to buy the game, probably not a problem since it's based on a popular show. But those people would have to have their Wi-Fi set up, and want to play Whack-A-Ghost so much that they'd log on to find someone. It doesn't seem that it's going to be used very much.   Ironically, Circle of Spies leaves out the very obvious use for multiplayer, cooperative play. It seems like an obvious choice, there are two playable characters, and teamwork is a major portion of the game. It's practically tailor made for two player, so it's disappointing that all we could play were minigames.  The Suite Life of Zack and Cody: Circle of Spies shows what happens when the developers make a solid effort to improve on their title. It's something that's rare with franchise titles, so props to A2M. That said, the game still isnt great, but it's working towards it. The faster paced gameplay is great, but the lack of any sort of coop mode is a bummer, especially considering the effort put into the Wi-Fi mode. It's weird to say this, but we actually look forward to the next game, if there is one. If A2M can keep improving their title, they might be able to make a game that transcends the pits of shovelware.", "date": "Nov 13, 2007"}
