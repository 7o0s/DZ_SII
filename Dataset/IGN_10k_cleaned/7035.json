Starting out in 2003 as Gorkey Zero: Beyond Honor, it morphed to Gorky Zero: Aurora Watching to, well, Aurora Watching until it finally arrived on US shores simply as Soldier Elite. It also changed hands from JoWood to DreamCatcher. Usually, such shifting and morphing spells trouble for the end product, and such is the case here, sadly. Throughout Solider Elite, the core of a compelling experience can be felt, but certain dated design decisions stuck to it like barnacles. What we end up with is a fairly good looking title with decent but unexceptional production values, with its true Achilles heel being an overheated and underwhelming devotion to much better stealth action games like Metal Gear Solid.   Like MGS, Soldier Elite offers a radar map that depicts the locations and movement of all the guards in the level, with color codes that indicate their level of awareness. If you make too much noise, they'll come looking around. If they see you, they'll shoot on sight. You'll have a plethora of gadgets and strangely enormous ventilation shafts at your disposal, plus a fairly large arsenal with multiple ammunition types. You'll also deal with security cameras that must be disabled by hacking into a nearby terminal, and klaxons that civilians and guards will activate if you don't shoot them quickly enough.   It all sounds fairly compelling, if familiar, but where Soldier Elite breaks down is the sheer psychic prowess of the enemies between you and a given objective. Mere footsteps will put the guards on alert, even though in theory they could be anyone's footsteps, not just some nefarious spy (you) bent on doing mean things to their organization. And enemies will shoot at you on sight, even through a vision-blurring blizzard when you're wearing a ski mask that completely hides your appearance. How they know that your footsteps and your mere appearance spells trouble that must be dealt with quickly and lethally is anyone's guess. There's no subtlety of distance, let alone swapping outfits to make yourself pass as a fellow guard. Although you have several gadgets that incapacitate an enemy, your only choice in the end is to kill them. A non-lethal mission is just not an option. The ways in which something like MGS or the Hitman games are more tactically rewarding would comprise an article in itself; suffice to say that I have a newfound appreciation for IO Interactive and Kojima's crew. Although both groups produce games with much higher production values, what matters is the core gameplay, and even mediocre moments in their games are better than the bulk of Soldier Elite.     Furthermore, the retail box trumpets ~relentless enemy A.I.~ We're told that guards will hunt you down until you are dead, but this is simply not the case. There are many exceptions. If enough time passes after a guard is alerted, he will eventually return to his routine -- even if he's stumbled upon a dead body. Sometimes they do pursue, but their behavior is not as absolute as the box copy claims. Sometimes they don't exhibit even fundamental survival skills. If two guys are sitting at a desk faced away from me, I can creep behind and knife them both, without either one of them registering my presence -- despite their loud death throes. And once an enemy is downed, getting our hero to navigate properly to his body to search for items can be oddly troublesome -- he'll walk into a desk or shelf for several seconds before he finally reaches down to rifle through the guard's pockets. On the whole, the AI is nothing to crow about. Sometimes they run away if you shoot them in the arm. But most times they stand in the open or stand behind an obstacle while you lean and take careful aim.   A snowmobile is also described as though it were an optional mode of transportation, when its presence, in practice, is part of a scripted segment where you must beat an arbitrary timer while plowing your way from point A to point B. Plus, the camera jostles disorientingly during this part, it's easy to get lost, and bumping into some objects, even at low speeds, can knock you off your ride and force you to restart.   Speaking of restarts, this game treats player death in a rather aggravating manner. Every single time you die, which happens often, you have to go through a laborious ~game over~ animation before the game gives you a percentage breakdown of how you did -- then it kicks you back to the menu screen. Perhaps ~laborious~ is unfair, but it gets to be a drag the 100th time around. The only thing I want to do at this point is load a save game, not see how I did or get kicked back to the menu. It's boggling that I don't get a pop-up menu of save games, or an auto-reload of my most recent slot. It's a barrier to the flow of gameplay that's downright discouraging at times.I could go on and detail how awkward it is to switch weapons, ammo, and gadgets; how hit-or-miss the voice acting is; how ambient conversation persists even when everyone around me is dead; how needlessly circuitous some of the routes are; how unsatisfying combat is; the unskippable title screens; the monotonous action music. But in the end, it's a seriously flawed experience that could have greatly benefited from more playtesting, particularly how death is treated. I heartily recommend the latest Hitman or Metal Gear installment over this.", "date": "Jun 28, 2006"}
