Eating Cookie Crisp in your underwear at 7:30am on Saturday, two inches from the TV, cheering on Peter Perfect, Penelope Pitstop, or maybe just hoping that Dick Dastardly and Muttley would just plow through them all with a Ford Excursion and win the damn race once and for all. All was forgotten, until gaming hit the cart-racing jag with Mario Kart, and went a little off its rocker with everything from Woody Woodpecker and LEGO to Crash Team Racing. It's only fair, then, that Infogrames jumps in with an actual racing cartoon to match with its cartoony racing game. In comes Wacky Races, a simplistic, cute looking, but overall shallow experience that will remind you off those sugar-filled breakfast cereals you chomped on for years -- a good initial punch, a fun buzz, then the inevitable crash and boredom.  The good thing about cart racing games is that they're beyond simple, meaning that you can truly pop them in and play them within minutes. Wacky Races installs about 80MB of files on your hard drive, and then you're ready to race. You can select from most of your favorites, from the Slag Brothers, Sergeant Blast, and Penelope, each with their own attributes for handling and top speed. Like any good cartoon racer, you'll have to traverse wacky environments, unorthodox obstacles like moving trains or maybe just a giant log, and use weapons in order to gain the upper hand. In the case of Wacky Races, you've got general slow-down weapons like a lightning cloud and dynamite, as well as specific weapons, like Sergeant  Blast's huge missile, or Red Max's paint bullets. When you pick up powerups, you also have the opportunity to use a speed-based powerup instead, from a siren that slows down all nearby racers, to a variety of tools that give you a few seconds of air-time, depending on your character. There's nothing shocking or surprising in the selection of weapons. If you've played any cart racer, you'll be more than familiar with the tools at hand, with the only difference being that the weapons work faster, and are used more often than in your average cart racer.  In terms of size, Wacky Races delivers about what you'd expect for a cart type game -- seven characters, four different course types, and 16 races in all. The courses tend to be on the short side, and for all their interesting texture and character design, the layouts are pretty standard. While not as monotonous as Mario Kart 64, Wacky Races doesn't hold a candle to the length, skill level, or interesting structure of games like Diddy Kong Racing on the N64, or Crash Team Racing on the PlayStation. What's most annoying is that Wacky Races falls for the cart racing trap, namely thinking that you can replace AI with funkyness and think that no one will notice. Driving skill rarely has anything to do with the place you'll finish in a race. Because weapons are so plentiful, and take so little skill to use, you'll constantly be getting smacked from behind with a missile or a siren or any number of gadgets, no matter how well you drive. At times it gets so exaggerated that you'll barely move a few feet without getting hit again... and again, and again. As for actual competition, it's hard to tell the difference between racing well, or racing poorly and firing your weapons regularly. I love weapons in cart games, but it should come down to your racing skills to win a race, and that rarely happened in Wacky Races. When it's not up to your skills, you're left with ~is it entertaining, at least?~, and in that respect Wacky Races fizzles out after a few races. Once you've gotten past the neat cartoon design of the game, you'll realize just how simplistic the levels are, despite some great moments. The secrets aren't very secret, the challenges aren't very challenging, and overall you'll find yourself bored after a few runs around a complete circuit of tracks.  Where's the toon shading? The Dreamcast version of this game featured cool, cool toon shading similar to the style used in Jet Grind Radio, and it perfected the overall look and feel of the game. Unfortunately, the PC version is sans-toon shading, so while it's still a pretty cute affair, it's not quite as cool as it could've been. Besides, when did a PC version feature less graphic features than a console version? As for the music, you can call it a range of styles... mainly ranging from midi-OK to midi-horrifying. About 50% of the time you'll feel fine, but every once in a while you'll hit a track that's like Hanna-Barbera filtered through bad keyboards, leaving you with jumpy, frolicky, and mostly annoying noise that will have you turning down your speakers. Parents, you'll learn to hate it.  As for multiplayer, it's kept to split screen. It runs well, and it's fun, but I was hungering for a little LAN, or even online play, something that's nonexistent in Wacky Races. You can't have everything, but if you're going to play on the PC, you should at least have a network option for those of us that like racing our friends without having to rub elbows on a small keyboard.  Wacky Races starts out fun enough, but the joy soon fades into the the fog that only a mid-Saturday afternoon of lawn-mowing and no cartoons can put you in. With more depth and an actual racing engine there could have been some fun gaming, but instead you're left with a short, simple, and fluffy affair that's best kept on the consoles, where bright eyed electric mice and magical plumbers are par for the course.  -- Vincent Lopez Want to share your opinions with the world?
