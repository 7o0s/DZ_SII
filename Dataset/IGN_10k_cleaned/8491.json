Fugitive charts O'Conner's escape from his former employer in LA, following him as he flees across the American South, making stops in small towns to get new rides and raise cash for survival.   Fugitive comes in two editions -- 2D and 3D -- and this review is solely for the 2D version. The 2D edition is primarily viewed from an isometric perspective, much like Rare's classic RC Pro-Am games on the original Nintendo Entertainment System. In case you missed out on the 8-bit scene, that's a compliment. Those were excellent racing games and Fugitive manages to capture some of that magic.   I-play's internal team has put together a mission-based racer that isn't quite open world -- it remains to be seen if sandbox-style game mechanics are appropriate for mobile -- but does give you a certain sense of freedom. In each city, you must earn a specific amount of money to feel safe enough to make a break for the next town. How you earn that money is up to you. You can participate in a series of road races within each city or take on story-based missions for the denizens of each town, such as ramming a rival car into submission or hitting a series of checkpoints without getting creamed by agitated cops. Once you break the bank, the option to flee is unlocked. If you like, you can stay in the city and complete all of the missions so you have a substantial bank account -- it's up to you.   As soon as you have the cash to leave town, the game hops from the isometric view to a top-down highway pursuit. You must clear the state line by out-running a phalanx of cop cars that become increasingly aggressive and intelligent as you push deeper into the game. They'll ram you, crash into you, and attempt to swerve in front of you to create a make-shift roadblock. These top-down highway races are really enjoyable -- they reminded me a lot of Spy Hunter -- and I wish there were more of them in the game, but they do serve as a great way to top off each city.   The 2D edition Fugitive features solid, responsive controls. Making hard corners in the city scenes isn't an exact science -- the game does make sure the streets are wide enough that you aren't constantly frustrated -- but those front wheels really do lurch when you need them to. You do have access to nitro boosts in the isometric town races, but there just isn't a thrilling sense of speed. The highway scenes are much faster, and this makes them a little more engaging. Offsetting the slower pace, though, is the AI of the other cars. The police are really adept at cornering you, so you have to be on the top of your game by the time you reach the third city in O'Conner's tour, Baton Rouge.   One thing that really bears mentioning -- Fugitive is not just a re-tread of last year's Tokyo Drift. This is a completely different game with its own set of mechanics. Your car doesn't fishtail and powerslide like Tokyo Drift -- this is more straightforward. As such, it's nice to see that I-play has made all four Fast and Furious titles their own games, not re-skins.   The game uses characters from the Fast and Furious universe, so you'll catch sight of Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez in Los Angeles. Paul Walker's portrait pops up whenever he chats up a local yokel. The dialogue is silly, but that's in keeping with the flicks. I-play's artists have done a nice job making each city look different. East LA is appropriately beige to capture the industrial buildings and unjustly run-down shops while Miami is all flash and bright colors. The game uses some good collision effects and I liked the constant laying of rubber whenever I threw the wheel to take a hard turn.  The Fast and the Furious: Fugitive is a fun little racing game. The speed is a tad slow and the game is a little short, but the tight controls and good AI go a long way to make up for this. As mentioned, I found the highway chases more enjoyable than the city missions, but at no point during my time with the game was I ever bored. The visuals are clear and colorful. The isometric view really gives the game that Pro Am vibe, like I was playing an RC take on the Fast and Furious world. Good stuff.", "date": "May 18, 2007"}
