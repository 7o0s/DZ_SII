Its alluring features will keep you glued to your seat for months, if not years.  In fact I haven't driven my real car in three weeks. The game is played in two different ways: Arcade mode and Gran Turismo (Simulation) Mode.  The arcade mode enables you to race exhibitions in which you can choose a fixed number of cars and tracks. The Real McCoy is in Gran Turismo mode, though, the real racing simulation. You start out with a set amount of cash -- just enough for your first car. But before you can do anything you have to earn the right to race by passing license tests.  After you pass say, the B license, you can race in the B class events. The higher the events, the more cash you can get to upgrade your car. In addition to a mad amount of cash,  if you take first place in an event, you also win a special car. And that's basically the whole idea: to race, to win cars, and to get rich.  In game racing is nothing less than divine. The computer usually keeps the race tight, up close and in your face, to make sure that there's no way you can accidentally win.  You're treated to a delight of S-curves, half circle turns, straight-aways, two-wheeler sharp turns, and a reasonable dose of challenge to boot.  The two camera views will serve you nice as well. Whether you like the good, but easy, exterior follow cam, or you prefer the super-fast real racing first-person perspective we seasoned racers use, either way, racers of all skill and class will be satisfied.  Whatever view you use, though, results in the same thing: driving around at high speeds!  The physics in Gran Turismo are fine-tuned to simulate those of the real world, and they're the best yet. Your car bounces through gravel, shakes violently at high speeds, flies through dips and mounds, and even gets on two wheels on sharp turns.  What Gran Turismo has that no other racer has (aside from its awesome gameplay) are its mind-boggling replays -- it's like watching a movie!  These replays are so great that even your worst race will still make you look like a first place wiener, I mean, winner. It's like the Viagra for crappy video game racing players.  The way the camera views switch, the way the cars scream around turns, man, it will keep those who are impotent hard for hours.  Gran Turismo is truly the mother of all racing games up to date.  It has it all: awesome gameplay, brilliant replays, and a reality factor that'll astound even the most hardened gamers -- no pun intended.  Jay Boor", "date": "Aug 23, 1998"}
