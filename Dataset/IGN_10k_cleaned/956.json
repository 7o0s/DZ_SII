At least that's what courteous people say when they're imitated. With Grind Session, even though the cool developers at Shaba (Pandemonium 1&2) said that they were in production with their game before they knew about Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, it appears that they have arrived well after the Hawk phenomenon, which makes them look like latecomers or, worse, imitators.    Putting all that aside for a second, former Crystal Dynamics team members at Shaba have done their homework, and in the skateboarding market, they've coded what appears to be one of the better ones. Shaba's game contains all of the essentials: top notch pro skaters, excellent, accurate reproductions of real skateboard locations, a loaded move list (with manuals), a hardcore soundtrack of alternative, punk and thrash, lots of secret areas, built-in combo sections, and tons of replay value, with compelling bonus areas, Technical Lines, and Dream House. In short, this game is not short on game.   Gameplay Whether or not Grind Session was in development before Tony Hawk (which is what the development team told us), I can't say. I can only judge the game by the time it has hit shelves, which means it follows a quick, decent sized legacy of skateboard games, including the first, Street Skater, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Thrasher, and Street Skater 2, making Grind Session the fifth of its kind.   Shaba doesn't score any credence or originality points for a creating a skateboarding game that plays and even looks exactly like Tony Hawk  heck, at least Thrasher tried something different  but it does earn points for some extra little things. ~Focused extras~ is what liked to call them. These smart additions to the now basic gameplay aspects of a skateboarding game create a more focused and open game. For instance, players can stop skating and use the Skater's Eye, by pressing L2, enabling you to see the environment from a first-person perspective. Tony Hawk could have used this feature. When using the Skater's Eye in Tournament mode, the clock stops, and doesn't penalize you for using it.   The Skater's Eye wouldn't be so helpful if there weren't Tech Lines to follow. Tech Lines are natural flow sections in the environment. They're areas that are perfect for performing high-scoring tricks, combination rails, or rail-to-rail grinds that lead you around different parts of the course. The most obvious example is a ramp that stands about 10 feet away from another ramp. You're clearly meant to perform a jump and tricks in between, and then land on the second ramp. The Tech Lines illustrate a colorful translucent line that paves the way. While you and I, the hardcore gamers, may have already seen that a mile away, not everybody sees them. The Tech Lines are especially helpful in the later levels, in areas where you simply would never have made the connection yourself, and you say to yourself, ~Oh wow, I can do that?!~  Another cool aspect that's new in Grind Session is the ~Possessed~ meter. Hit a bunch of combos and then you'll become ~possessed~ with extra speed and a faster spin rate. It's not a major revolutionary new feature, but it compels skaters to earn more points and, well, it looks cool. I'm a sucker for flashy arcade stuff. So sue me.   While Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was never hard, Grind Session eases up in a few areas that Tony Hawk could have eased up on, such as performing tricks off the sides of ramps. The way in which these courses and many skate parks are designed leads skaters to ride right off them. In Grind Session, if you perform the tricks and miss the ramp on the way down, you may not get all of your points, but the game's default landing puts you bottom side down, so that your wheels land, and you can continue on intact. In real life, you bite it, but hey, this is a videogame.   Probably the best aspect of Grind Session is its course design. With eight basic arenas, each with a bonus areas built into them (not including the Dream House, a bonus environment that's packed with amazingly designed rooms), games are provided with quite a number of areas to perfect. Taking a nod from Thrasher, Shaba created the SF Mission level, which enables you to jump a BART train. (And you can actually make the jump, too.) Using Burnside, Shaba has re-created the infamous skating location with a better accuracy than any other game to date. The section above and the extra area over the fences are quite cool in their own right, too. Again, cool courses were part of the keystones in Tony Hawk, and these aren't too original in comparison, but they're good courses to skate.   What takes the level designs up a notch are the availability of nearly everything you can see. If you view a barrel, you can hit it, jump off it, or use it to jump and grind onto another object. That's just an obvious example, though. There are literally dozens of areas that provide multiple possibilities for tricks and stunts. The game is packed with all sorts of just-out-of-reach objects, such as rafters, ceiling beams, in one level there's an airplane hanging from the ceiling (and yes, it's skateable), and obvious lofty things hanging from the ceilings and walls, that are clearly there for a reason. There also are eight basic courses, Da Banks, SF Mission, Burnside, Slam City, Atlanta, PlayStation Park, London, Detroit, Huntington, and the ninth, Dreamhouse (East and West Wings).   Of the four modes, Training, Tournament, Open Skate, and Endurance, my favorite is Tournament, which is really the heart of the game. The way to open up new levels is to earn different kinds of Points (or ~Respect~). There are Trick Points, Pro Points, Technical Lines, and Vandal Points (bottles, pigeons, trash cans, cones, boom boxes, boxes, etc.). Half way through Tournament, you compete in a contest, and if you place in the top three, you get a vanity Photo Shoot, which is a neat little congratulatory thing. Each time you succeed in earning Respect points, you open up new moves, new levels, and more. If you complete the Training successfully, you open up about five new boards. Finally, there are 67 tricks listed just in the manual. I suspect there are even more that can be opened up and mastered.  As for the two-player mode, well, it's there, and you have choices between competing or teaming up with a buddy, but the game doesn't provide you with a split-screen mode. Nor does it offer up graffiti mode, nor.... So yeah, you can play in two-player mode, but it's nothing new, or terribly exciting.  Graphics While the gameplay in Grind Session feels relatively good, the graphics don't stand up as well. Texture wise, the game is quite detailed. Pigpen's tattoos are amazingly detailed and, er, accurate, too (nice skull tattoo, pal...). Lots of unique textures were used in the backgrounds and for the particular skaters, and the use of colors throughout the game leans toward the bright, colorful side.   But frankly, the game starts to fall apart in the technical areas. Even though the textures are in some respects better than in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, overall, the game doesn't share the same sheen or technical finesse, by a long shot.   First, while this is a design choice, rather than a flaw, oftentimes the camera swirls around in front of you, which in my gaming experience is a giant pain in the butt. I never want to be running, walking, or, let's say, skateboarding really, really fast into a camera. It's a bad idea.    Another thing feels weird. The skater doesn't seem to be of the same world as the background. There's a stark difference between the look of the skater and the look of the environment. It's like he's skating against a giant blue screen in a B movie. The end result is that the game doesn't convince the eye that the skater is part of the surroundings; it just doesn't click.   While crashes are always pretty cool, but there is no blood in Grind Session, and frankly a little blood is good. It creates a little more realistic impact, i.e. that painful, grab-your-crotch feeling that lets you know you just bit it...hard. Again, when you crash in this game, the surreal feeling of not being of the same world creeps up again, as the skater slides across the pavement like he's on ice. A few other areas, such as glitchy camera angles, and textures that weren't drawn in appear randomly throughout the game, which contribute to the whole unpolished feeling of the game as well.   Sound As for the music, it's pretty cool stuff, Maynard. The cross section of bands ranging from the once-edgy Sonic Youth to NOFX, Black Flag, Dr. Octogon, GZA, KRS-One, Man or Astroman, to Zen Guerrilla are good, standard ~skate~ bands that feed the frenetic need to do radical, crazy stuff. I quite liked this selection, in fact. Thank God, there's no Rob Frickin' Zombie on this game!   The sound effects are crisp and clear, too. The sound of the BART train, the scratching in between every choice in the menus (which I never grew tired of), the ~umphs~ and ~Uhhhgggs~ of your falls, they all did their part in creating a package of sound that's convincing and accurate. In the end Grind Session is a good game. It's not original, nor terribly innovative, but it plays well. And it's pretty fun. Those things count for something. It also presents a couple of features that work well in skateboarding games, and that haven't been seen before. I can't help but think, however, that the core of the game is pulled straight from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The biggest problem I see here is not that Grind Session sucks, quite the opposite. It's OK. But a weird kind of reverse kinetic starts working on me when I play it. Grind Session plays so much like Tony Hawk, it feels so identical to Tony Hawk, and it controls so much like Tony Hawk, that when I pick up the controller, and start playing it, I just want to play Tony Hawk instead. Why? Because the original is better. Tony Hawk is a better game, hands down. It's like choosing between imitation crab and real crab, except they're the same price. Or like picking shoes, which do you pick at the same price, Nike or a Taiwanese imitation? Hmm...The developers at Shaba would have done themselves a big favor by trying harder to differentiate Grind Session from Tony Hawk, rather than to imitate it. And even if it was developed before Tony Hawk, Grind Session feels like an imitation.", "date": "May 26, 2000"}
