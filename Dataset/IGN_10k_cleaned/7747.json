Third in Nintendo's mascot fighting series, first in the ranks of anticipation for next year's upcoming releases. The surprise announcement and trailer at E3 caused a megaton explosion of hype among the Big N faithful, and the company to thank is HAL.   HAL Laboratory created the Smash Bros. series, setting in motion the chain of events that has led to the daily increases in your frothing demand for its latest installment. Tracing the timeline back a bit further, we find that HAL first got its start pretty much as far away from the fighting genre as possible. It was on the NES, and the game was Pinball.   One of the 18 NES launch titles, Pinball was a home console conversion of arcade gaming's precursor cousin. Earlier attempts to bring pinball into video games were woeful, but the power of the NES let HAL, who did the programming work, realize a true vision of bumping, flipping and plunging.   Pinball offers only one table, but it's two screens tall - a lengthening convention still used today. The field is filled with obstacles and obstructions, offering opportunities to score high and fast. There's a thin animal theme to the presentation, with seals and penguins taking up residence on the upper end of the table and baby chicks claiming the lower, but overall it's a pretty straightforward, no-frills look.   A third screen can be accessed with a proper shot of the ball - a bonus stage, starring Mario. The pasta-packing plumber portages a plank above his person, running back and forth along the screen to keep the pinball in play, Breakout-style. The damsel in distress from Donkey Kong, Pauline, appears at the northernmost edge of the stage, and must be caught and saved by Mario if and when she falls.   Playing Pinball again today on the Wii, it's easy to be underwhelmed. It's the oldest game currently available for the Virtual Console, and the novelty of its adaptation of a real pinball experience is lost now, two decades later, when modern gamers have seen several home console and handheld takes on playing the silver ball.   This first design still holds up today, though, old as it is - a fact recognized by Nintendo when it was selected as one of two pack-in games for the Game Boy Advance e-Reader hardware just a few years ago.  Pinball also reappeared in Animal Crossing on the GameCube, as a collectible and playable emulated item.   A positive here, in this most recent reissue, is its simple control - a Wiimote turned on its side serves just as well as a sold-separately Classic Controller. But Pinball's main draw will have to remain its place in industry history. HAL's experience with Pinball on the NES gave them their start, and the company would go on to create many more games for Nintendo - like the Kirby and Smash Bros. franchises. So when you're having fun next year pummeling your friends with Pit or Solid Snake, take a moment to remember. Remember the game that started it all. It was HAL's first effort, Pinball.  Revisiting HAL's first game here on the Virtual Console is fun, but, like the other early NES titles hitting the Wii Shop, it's a limited production. Pinball only has one table and one bonus stage, and that's not a lot of depth for your dollars. Fans of inclined tables may be better served putting their money toward more robust or unique pinball experiences, like the playable-on-the-Wii-through-backwards-compatibility GameCube title Odama.", "date": "Dec 5, 2006"}
