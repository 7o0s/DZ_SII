The videogame icon set in motion a wave of imitators, all with big guns and even bigger breasts, but few of these competitors could so easily copy Tomb Raider's smart level designs or its compelling mix of free-roaming exploration and rewarding environmental puzzles. A hit on its hands, publisher Eidos Interactive released several sequels, most of which followed the same (and increasingly dated) gameplay formula -- Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness signifying a large misstep for the franchise. Then, developer Crystal Dynamics took over and reignited Croft's fading star with Tomb Raider: Legend, a game that boasted enhanced controls and better graphics than any other entry in the series. There's your history. Tomb Raider: Anniversary, which released earlier this year for PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 and now arrives for Wii, is the convergence of old and new -- a retelling of the original game, but updated and re-imagined, running on the Legend engine. If you grew up raiding tombs with Ms. Croft, you will find the adventure that first hooked you, made better. On Wii, you will also unearth new mechanics created specifically for Nintendo's controller. But you will also quickly discover that so many of the fundamental shortcomings of the series are still buried deeply within this remake.  Same traditional control.  New Wii innovations.  If you have always liked the Tomb Raider games, you will definitely like Anniversary, too. The game follows Lara Croft from the beginning of her long and illustrious career -- and we do mean beginning. The tale picks up well before the character became a sex symbol, as she -- a child -- explores her first environment. We'll leave the spoilers out, but the storyline weaves through multiple ancient cities and underground caverns, and deals with treasured artifacts along with long-lost monsters. As in the original outing, Lara will travel from Peru and Egypt to Greece and even to some lost civilizations as she attempts to unravel the story. The title feature's a robust selection of environments to explore and enemies to fight, from wolves and bears to crocodiles, gorillas, lions, and yes, even a T-Rex when the occasion calls for something a little larger. If you're keeping a tally, Crystal Dynamics hasn't exactly designed a room-for-room remake of the original -- some areas feature new constructions and challenges, while others have actually been trimmed a bit in the decade since we last saw them. The developer seems to have hit upon the right balance of what to keep, what to lose, and what to embellish upon, because the adventure's pacing is tight.  We grew up with Tomb Raider and played most of the games in the series, but at some point they all started to feel the same. Sure, Lara's breasts continued to inflate, but very few gameplay innovations were introduced. So it is was refreshing to see the franchise updated with Legend -- a makeover whose improvements translate to Anniversary. Never mind that Crystal Dynamics has brought Lara's physique back to reality -- she's no longer a Pamela Anderson-on-crack look-a-like, but of a more athletic build all around.    The fact is, the controls have been largely tweaked for the better, which is what the series has needed all along -- not more guns or deadlier enemies. On Wii, this means that you can maneuver the heroine around large 3D environments using the analog stick, and she's more responsive. The  process of turning in any direction is quicker and as a result Lara feels less like a tank and more like a human being. She can still climb platforms, hang from and shimmy alongside ledges and leap to protruding poles (which have a way of being conveniently placed among ruined cities), and these maneuvers still work adequately and simultaneously increase her bodily arsenal. Some subtle enhancements have also been introduced. For instance, Croft can jump diagonally to grab onto objects and she can balance atop very thin platforms. Also, when making a particularly big leap of faith, you will actually have to press up on the D-Pad as Lara grabs onto a ledge so that she doesn't slip off -- a small inclusion that demands you pay attention and ups the tension as you navigate deadly terrain.      Compared to the original Tomb Raider, the controls powering Anniversary are highly evolved. However, games as a whole have come a long way since Croft changed the landscape of 3D adventures and when you dare to pit Lara's latest against the control responsiveness and environmental interactivity found in a Prince of Persia game, well, she just can't compete. This truth becomes apparent as you progress through the game. Although speedier than ever before, Lara still feels slow to turn and heavier than we'd like. Furthermore, the camera, which can be controlled manually on Wii by holding the C button and dragging the screen with the Wii remote, tends to get in the way just as much as it helps pave the way. Too often your view will be obstructed by a foreground object or the action will be shot from an angle which makes it difficult to gauge depth, a problem when attempting precision jumps. The camera is at its worst when the heroine is under attack by multiple enemies, especially if you're backed into a corner, at which time your viewpoint may go haywire as the system fights to orient itself.  New Wii puzzles, now with tiny floating Lara hands.  The thing is, while these criticisms are certainly valid and do indeed detract from the end experience, they hardly ruin it. In fact, Anniversary remains a highly moody and mostly entertaining adventure game despite its shortcomings. This is because it is still as fun to explore mysteriously empty and moody tombs and ruins as it was a decade ago. Each level works like one giant puzzle and it's up to you to put the pieces together, so to speak, in order to advance. Whether it's assembling a mechanical contraption that opens a gateway or climbing up, swinging across a chasm, jumping from pole to pole, and finally leaping down into a pond below, you will more likely than not be dazzled by the complexity and immensity of some stages. Like the first game and every one since, this is where Tomb Raider succeeds, and when it's successful, it's really successful. We only wish that Croft's adventures were all exploratory quests void of the clunky gunplay which, while definitely improved due to the Wii remote's ability to target on-screen enemies with pixel-perfect accuracy, are still cumbersome because Lara is slow and the camera system is slower.  While Tomb Raider's debut on Wii could technically be called a port, it as at least an enhanced one. We suppose it had better be since it's here so much later than the other versions. Crystal Dynamics has made use of the Wii remote and nunchuk in some good and bad ways, and we've already mentioned some of those above. We do really appreciate the ability to point the Wii remote at the screen and shoot at enemies or target objects. It does feel very natural. The same goes for using Lara's flashlight, which is conveniently mapped to the Wii remote's pointer functionality. We also like the Wii-exclusive puzzles --- for instance, using the controller to point at and pick up objects, or to scroll pieces, and so on. It's clear that the developer really thought about how to capitalize on the remote in order to add an extra layer of interactivity to the experience. On the other hand, we're never happy when precision maneuvers -- using the grappling hook, for instance -- are mapped to motion controls on the nunchuk. For the most part, the benefits the Wii controls bring to the title outweigh any drawbacks, though.   Anniversary on Wii looks like its PlayStation 2 predecessor with a few minor enhancements. The locales Lara explores are varied in design and feature jutting architecture. Some are surrounded by bodies of water with shimmering transparencies. Lighting and particle effects help enhance the visual make-up. Meanwhile, Lara is generally well-animated and some of her maneuvers are just as fun to watch as they are to perform. On the other hand, the framerate really takes a hit in certain situations and we really can't figure out why considering that far better looking titles run smoothly -- at 60 frames, even -- on Wii. To its credit, the game features some truly atmospheric music that is sometimes-subtle and yet it always helps maintain the air of character isolation that is, like Metroid, a staple of this series.Tomb Raider: Anniversary for Wii is a competently executed enhanced port of the previously released PlayStation 2 affair that also happens to be good fun at its best and frustrating at its worst. Croft controls and looks better than she ever has before and yet she still has a long way to go if she's to provide real competition to the Prince of Persia, who has, in my mind, out-Tomb Raidered Tomb Raider in recent years. The Wii control additions really do add to the experience and the game looks pretty good, too. The end product is not exemplary, but it is a step in the right direction and it's also entertaining, particularly when you're jumping from ledge to ledge or swinging across chasms to the beat of moody music.  Although I think it's just as good as previous versions of Anniversary, I've lowered the score of the game on Wii because little effort has been made to capitalize on the added horsepower of Nintendo's console. That the framerate regularly suffers in wide-open levels is really disappointing. I wouldn't call it a deal breaker, but an unfortunate oversight.", "date": "Nov 13, 2007"}
