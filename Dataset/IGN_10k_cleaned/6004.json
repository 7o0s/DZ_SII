{"name": "Pump It Up: Exceed", "name_review": "Pump it Up: Exceed", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/10/pump-it-up-exceed", "text": "Since you've just clicked on a review of a dancing game it's a fair bet that you've played one in the past and probably already have a plastic pad taking up space in your home. Pump It Up: Exceed is another game in the genre, but it breaks out of the four-button pad setup that the Dance Dance Revolution series and In the Groove use. Thankfully, the new pad with its directional arrows on the corners and a new button in the middle easily justifies its existence for the new kinds of dance moves that can be pulled off and with over a 100 songs to play through there's a lot of dancing to do. This makes it a worthy alternative even if it still has some growing up to do.   It's possible to buy Pump It Up: Exceed as a standalone game, but the only way you're going to truly play it is to pick up the bundle for $20 more. The pad itself has a sticky bottom and stays firmly in place on a hard surface so there should be no worries in it moving around. That makes sure that all your attention can be focused on the dancing itself and you're going to need it. With a fifth center button there are now five icons to keep track of on the screen as well as four new buttons combos that can be used in the game. But since the center button is adjacent to the corner buttons, these new combinations can be hit with a single well-placed foot.   What the new button layout enables the game to do is to throw out many more movements into the songs. Players are required to move around the pad in more ways than in the other dancing games and the double-button jumps can have them facing left, right, and diagonally. The designers have used this new possibility well in the choreography so that the dance moves feel more like dancing than elsewhere. This can also make the moves a little trickier to pull off and for the hardcore there is much more to take care of here.   Another benefit of the five buttons and their configuration is that the arrows on the screen are in a more intuitive layout. The DDR games stick to the standard icons with the arrows pointing left, down, up, and left, the Pump It Up: Exceed layout has the buttons (from left to right) as back left, front left, center, front right, and back right. This makes the screen easier to read, especially for those new to the genre.   With the new moves in hand there are loads of songs to go and explore with over 100 tracks making an appearance here. There are a few licensed tracks here from The Crystal Method, Sugarhill Gang, and Elvis Presley, but the vast majority are original tracks. But even though they're unknown they still represent a surprisingly healthy amount of different music genres. Latin beats work into hip hop and on into some hard rock and on through to some J-Pop. The songs are professionally done and all of them have a pretty happy feel to them to add to the party atmosphere.     In the case of the dancing alone with the songs, Pump It Up: Exceed is hugely successful. The songs ramp up from simple steps to some fiendishly intricate choreography that requires intense amounts of practice. And you're going to sweat, a lot, but you should be enjoying yourself too much to notice. It's the meat of the game and it succeeds.   With such a fun alternative to the other dancing games, it's a shame that many elements in the menu system itself bring the game down. The dance pad has up, down, left, and right arrows to move through the main menus and then it's possible to stand on the game arrows on the corners and select with the center button. This makes sense and then when entering into the song selection area the corner arrows start to work for moving around the menus as well. This means that players have to get off the pad to choose a song and then reach into the middle with a foot to hit the center button and select.   Even more frustrating, the songs themselves have no information that pops up when they're highlighted. The different levels of difficulty don't pop up until after the song has been selected and going back to the song menu means walking around the pad to tap the back button that's on the upper-left corner. There's also no information about the current top score for a song or whether or not it's been completed. With over 100 songs that ultimately fill out the list this is a vital piece that could have been included in the presentation.   Even though the dance pad that comes in the bundle is a good enough one and on par with the DDR pads out there, it's still the only option. This is perfectly fine for those who are used to these pads, but there's no denying that there are other pads on the market that definitely enhance the DDR experience and having played with those for a while it's disappointing that this pad is all there is. Without a definite ~feel~ on the pad it's possible to lose track of where one's feet are. This can be played around and dealt with, but not having other options to enhance the experience is definitely a problem.Throwing in an extra button could have easily become just a gimmick, but Pump It Up: Exceed is far from that. The different layout allows for some new and more diverse dancing patterns that work better in creating more appropriate choreographies. The result is a game that includes more of the sense of movement into the game, similar to that of playing a DDR game or In the Groove with two dance pads, but without the hassle of setting up an even larger dance space. With the variety in the huge song selection there's a lot of dancing to love here. It's still just a shame that the presentation and design of everything around the dancing still needs some work.", "date": "Sep 10, 2005"}
