You know the one -- nice bike physics, detailed player models and animations, and lots and lots of dirt.  Unfortunately, Moto-X misses the point in so many ways.  It is trying to be too many things at once, and doesn't do a good job in any specific area.  The installation was swift, but you must endure several minutes of loading time before actually getting into the main menu.  The menu details are crisp and easy to read, enabling you to hop right on your bike and start riding if you wish, but stop right there...you may want to go back to the options menu and take down some of the detail.  Even on a PII450 with 128MB RAM, when I slid those sliders to the max, this puppy started chuggin' like a choo-choo train going up a mountain.  For a game that requires a 3D accelerator and states that the minimum requirement is a PII233, you would expect a smoother ride.  Unfortunately, it's not there unless you sacrifice lots and lots of graphical detail.  There are three main game types available for your biking pleasure: Motocross, Supercross, and Freestyle.  Motocross is your standard race where players vie for top position in the standings -- except for one main difference.  All the courses available to you have absolutely nothing to do with real dirt biking locales.   For example, you'll find yourself on a tropical island with a crashed plane and people parachuting down right before your eyes.  Another track is supposedly set in downtown Paris where you can speed down narrow streets.  But the problem is that with so many blind turns and lots of crashing into walls, you may find yourself too frustrated to finish the race.  It's not so bad that the game is an arcade racer as opposed to a realistic sim, but the difficulty level just doesn't fit with the arcade feel.  One of my biggest tribulations was with the level design.  The actual idea was there, but it wasn't translated well.  Every time you go off a jump, the distance varies.  Basically, you need to go on the jump to see how far it is, so you know how fast you need to be going in order to make it without crashing.  The courses are not designed for a biker's fluid motion throughout.  It seems like the designers at Deibus Studios almost expect you to crash every 20 feet, so you'll be going slower over the jumps.  Unfortunately, Supercross wasn't much better than Motocross.  You are racing inside a giant arena, on a dirt track.  There are jumps, twists, and dips, but it's just, well...boring.  The problem with the jumps being poorly designed is even more apparent in this mode, for it's nearly impossible to make it one lap without misjudging a leap and landing face first.  The final mode, Freestyle, tries to exploit the player's creative side, and like the other modes, ultimately fails miserably.  The actual stunt area that you are to be performing your ~death-defying~ tricks is just too small for comfort.  On one level, which takes place inside a city, you can travel from one end to the other in about 10 seconds.  It is also on an island, so you will be making frequent trips to the bottom of the sea.  This gives you very little room to maneuver and pull off insane stunts, which should be one of the highlights of this game.    Speaking of tricks, one of the more disappointing aspects of the game were its stunt controls.  You assign stunt buttons to your controller (or for you people with keyboards, easy to reach keys), and press them followed by a control pad combination to initiate a stunt.  For example, A+Up+Left will give you a no hands trick.  When you get to the more complex stunts, a meter is initiated.  While the rider is in the air performing the actual stunt, you must keep the rider balanced on his axis by moving the control pad.  If he is tilted too far in one direction, a little puck will slide in that direction and you must counter that to keep your rider on the bike.  While the developers may have been attempting to try something new and creative, it was ultimately just frustrating and annoying.   Baja, a smaller mode that is implanted into the Motocross, Supercross, and Freestyle, is just a simple point to point race.  Follow the onscreen arrow, and try to beat it in a given amount of time.  Whoopee, you have points on the map that you have to trigger in a specific amount of time.  Not much fun if you ask me, especially with the courses being as lame as they are.  One thing that I did enjoy, however, was the way that the Motocross and Freestyle courses were ~looped~.   Think of it being like a mini planet, and if you travel in one direction for a long time, you will pop back up on the other side of the track.  This gives some room for exploration, as some of the scenery can be beautiful with impressive lighting effects and creative texturing.  The music can be quite catchy at first, with some rock tunes, and upbeat techno mixes.  However, after racing a few times, it becomes tiresome and repetitive.  The sound in the game is well done, with bike and rider sounds on par.  One thing that I really liked about Moto-X (one of the only things, mind you) was the interaction with the environment.  You can hit practically anything around you, and it has its own sound.  For example, on the level Phantasy Isle there is a crashed airplane with its wing jutting out into your path.  You can easily avoid it, but if you hit it it yields a grinding metal sound.  On a different course with a countryside setting you can travel off the track and onto a farm.  You can actually crash into a cow and get a nice ~MOOOO~ in return.  Excellent use of 3D positional audio, and superb sound effects add something to a game that is lacking everywhere else.  After trying out what the game had to offer in single-play, I tried to get some multiplay action in.  Unfortunately, there wasn't anyplace online where I could play. Attention Euro Studios: maybe people would actually be able to play your game online if there were some servers.  With online play non-existent, don't look for much expandability here.  If you want a Motocross game that feels a lot like of Jet Moto but doesn't play nearly as well, you might find some mediocre thrills with Edgar Torronteras' Moto-X 2000, but I doubt it.  While playing, I found myself making frequent comparisons to Microsoft's Motocross Madness.  Each time I booted up Moto-X, I was thinking, ~They did this a year ago, only 100 times better.~  So if you're looking for a game to hold you over to Motocross Madness 2...keep looking.  This one is just not worth the time.  -- Mark Birnbaum", "date": "Apr 25, 2000"}
