A fair amount of water and some very noteworthy RPGs have passed under the bridge in the intervening time, and while this is still a very pretty game (helped remarkably by the bright Game Arts design style), technical limitations mean it's not quite as smooth and crisp as rendered by its original console.    Is it worth buying?  Well, this is still one of the best RPGs on PS2, even as the system's library begins to grow and continues to do so in the coming year.  It is very much an example of Game Arts' strengths, especially character and combat design -- there's a likable cast here, especially considering it was the designer's first game, and this is one of the best battle systems in the genre.  Looks are not everything, after all, especially not the purely technical aspects thereof.  But it's also worth noting that you could have played this game some time ago, and perhaps you still could for a good deal less money.  Grandia II is a worthy enough purchase as far as aesthetics are concerned, but the economics of the situation might incline you in a different direction.  Gameplay  As seems to often be the case with Game Arts, the combat system in Grandia II takes the lead among its various finer qualities.  It's superficially similar to the Active Time system from the Final Fantasy series (or, well, that used to be from the Final Fantasy series), but with many more features to mix things up.  Chiefly, positioning is now an issue -- you don't just stand toe-to-toe opposite your opponents.  Movement is mostly automatic, a consequence of which opponents a character hits with melee attacks, but the deft manipulation of who attacks what targets can lend substantial advantage.  It's also a factor to take into account when using area-effect spells and skills.  Related to movement, but an important aspect of strategy in its own right, is learning how to work with the active time initiative system.  The progress of each combatant towards their turn to act is measured on a bar in the lower-right corner of the screen, so at a glance you can tell who's up next (although the speed of a character's progression up the bar varies according to their individual attributes).  Strange that the Final Fantasy games would implement something like that only just now (in FFX), and after going back to straight turn-based initiative.  In any event, the active time system does mean the occasional spot of waiting to move, but the pace of battles is always fast, and that time may be useful for preparing a counterattack.  Part of the initiative bar shows the interval between choosing an action and its execution -- attacks move through this space quickly, while special attacks require some charge time.  It's possible to use that time to attack an incoming enemy, scoring a counter bonus, or disrupt an opponent's charging spell.  The strategies involved, again, are not exceptionally complex, but they help work to keep battles from getting dull.  Surprising, then, that a game with some of the most entertaining combat sequences in the genre would let you pass on a fight if you want to (same goes for Chrono Cross, now that I think about it).  As in Lunar and the first Grandia, encounters are not random, and it's possible to dodge the enemies that wander around the dungeons.  That's one aspect of a generally excellent dungeon design package, including well-tuned puzzles that become progressively more difficult along a very smooth curve.  It's possible to get lost now and again in some areas, especially if you grow over-fond of spinning the camera around, but the variable compass usually points the way towards the right way.  Outside the combat system, Grandia II is a fairly conventional RPG, with skill and attribute development that progress more or less according to the acquisition of experience points.  The Mana Egg system lends itself to a little bit fun sidequesting to develop magic, though.  Eggs are found throughout the quest after special events or in a couple of out-of-the-way places.  They're what enable a character to cast spells, and develop along their own lines -- thus, they make for a separate issue to manage in tandem with building the characters themselves.  Put some effort into it, and you can pick up such deadly spells as ~BA-BOOM!~ (not to be confused with the vanilla ~BOOM!~).  This, then, is another in the string of very well-designed Game Arts RPGs.  Even if it may not be so much fun to look at or listen to now and again (more on that later, of course), it's always plenty of fun to play.   Graphics  It's a little depressing to observe that the same thing has happened, visually speaking, to two Grandias in a row now.  First, the Saturn original was introduced to an American audience through a substantially inferior PlayStation version.  Now we have the PlayStation 2 version of the sequel, and it can't hang with its Dreamcast counterpart.  It's not as bad as what happened to the original Grandia, which lost great wodges of sprite detail and every beautiful Mode 7 effect, but maybe all those Sega-loving pit-fiends had a point after all...  I kid, but the fact remains that Grandia II looked better in its original form.  The PS2 port takes a mild hit in terms of texture quality, especially in less conspicuous background areas, and it's a good deal rougher around the edges, with a bit more aliasing and a lot more interlace flicker in certain areas.  It's still a pretty game to look at, though, with the excellent character designs and vivid colors that have become a series trademark by now.  The battle graphics are a trade-off between great monster designs and character animations, shown off by a constantly-moving cinematic camera, and the shortcut Game Arts took for rendering many of the special attack and spell effects.  Spells are split between realtime animations, some of which come with excellent lighting effects in tow, and pre-rendered MPEG videos superimposed over the battlefield.  The former leave no room for complaint, but the latter feel like they were implemented to overcome weaknesses in the 3D engine.  The compression artifacting in most of the videos is terrible, akin to what you get if you stretch a low-res MPEG out to full screen on your computer, which makes for a very disconcerting contrast to the sharp realtime effects.  I didn't mind this technique when it was put to use in Valkyrie Profile, but in that instance it was used much more sparingly, and with better compression as a consequence.  What's most unfortunate about Grandia II's graphical issues is that there's so much excellent visual raw material here.  The character designs, Yushi Kanoe's first effort after popping up in a Game Arts talent search, include a few personal favorites (Roan's a gimp, but Elena and Millenia have plenty going for them), and the world around them has the same blend of freshness and traditionalism as the first Grandia and the Lunar series.  It manages to be familiar without being cliched.  The glitches, however, mar the artwork that went into creating the game, especially since the DC version did it better justice.  Narrative  Like most RPGs, Grandia II is carried more by its characters than its story (hard to compose a compelling narrative that lasts more than 40 hours without relying at least a little bit on convention), but they're a likable crew for the most part, if not possessed of the same youthful appeal as the original Grandia cast.  Ryudo, the hero, is great fun when he's being a jerk, which plays very nicely off heroine Elena's ability to amusingly shocked.  Outside the leading pair, Millennia hams it up quite effectively, although she sometimes switches from ~funny~ flirting to the ~gag me with a rubber noodle~ alternative.  Nevertheless, the game's presentation of these personalities occasionally leaves a little to be desired.  I apologize for the crude language here, but it must be said that a lot of the dialogue in this game is RAW CHEESE.  Dead RAW.  Some of the worst fantasy fustian the mind could possibly devise.    Curiously, though, that's not a trend that dominates the game.  The text frequently features realistic and readable dialogue, alternating between stretches of overstarched pain, as if the writers were in need of a powerful mood stabilizer.  Occasionally, this gear even shifts in the middle of a conversation, with the same character.  Ryudo, strangely enough, sounds thoroughly human when he's acting like a jerk, but the writers can't come up with a believable way for him to be chivalrous.  As soon as he tries to be nice to Elena, the cringe factor lights up off the scale.  Perhaps there's a universal truth to be derived here concerning male human nature.  Something to think about on a lazy afternoon.  It's worth noting that in no way do I blame Ubi Soft's localization team -- this feels much more like the kind of issue that was in the original script.  The translators, as they say, were just following orders.  When the dialogue is good, it's quite good, and the management of slang and idiom is pleasantly smooth.  Sound  This section should be prefaced with the acknowledgement that Anoop Gantayat, the wretched Grandia junkie formerly employed by IGN Dreamcast, will defend Grandia II's soundtrack to the absolute death.  He will brook no insult against it.  Thus, it stands to reason that gamers who will enjoy it do exist (especially if they also liked Richard Jacques' compositions in Sonic R).  However, your humble narrator is not one of them (and he has no fear of Anoop, thanks to the ocean between he and I).  When Grandia II's compositions stay light and upbeat, there's nothing particularly wrong with the sound -- it's not what you'd call inspiring, but it certainly works.  The tunes become progressively less pleasant as the intensity level rises, though, and the guitar-driven battle theme is particularly hard on the ears.  That's rather unfortunate, since you hear it more often than any other piece of music in the game.  The decision to make Grandia grow up, as it were, may have been a good one as far as other aspects of the game were concerned, but the experiment achieves only so-so results in the music department.  Ditto Ubi Soft's first attempt at localizing a game with a good deal of spoken dialogue.  Voice acting is reserved for major conversations, remaining absent for long stretches of conversation and adventuring, but when it does appear, it's a very mixed bag.  Ubi shelled out for actors you'll likely recognize from other roles (particularly Metal Gear Solid 2 and various cartoon series), but the overall tone of the voices seems to be one of excessive accentuation.  Ryudo sounds a little too snide and self-satisfied, Elena sounds a little too shy and retiring, Millennia sounds a little too much like a slut, Roan sounds a little too much like a whiny little kid...see what I mean?  The personalities would have benefited from being turned down a little, as it were.  Of course, a fair amount of blame can be chalked up to the script, which as mentioned above includes some very questionable lines.I'm not sure what the current state of the secondary Dreamcast market is right now, but I do know that a few months ago, at least, you could buy a new Dreamcast on clearance and a copy of Grandia II to play on it for about as much money as the brand-new PlayStation 2 version will cost you now.  Maybe it would cost a little more than $50, but you'd get a Dreamcast out of the deal, meaning you could get on with playing Bangaioh (since I know you haven't yet).Viewed purely in the context of the PlayStation 2, of course, Grandia II is perhaps one of the top three RPGs on the system.  If you don't want to buy anything for any other system (ya doink), go ahead and pick this up.  It has its ups and its downs, and it certainly isn't the equal of its predecessor, but it's a good-looking game and an absolutely great-playing one, which is getting to be a harder thing to say of RPGs nowadays.  Nevertheless, Dreamcast fans get to lay down at least this one trump card -- Sega's system did it better.For information on Ubi Soft's Great RPG Giveaway, of which Grandia II is a part, follow the link you just finished reading.", "date": "Feb 6, 2002"}
