For flight simulation fans, the game is the only one in the Xbox 360 library to offer realistic flight battles. Surprisingly, this marks the second flight combat game released for Microsoft's sleek white machine in its still very much young lifespan. Blazing Angels is the other game, also published by Ubisoft, though it's a much more action-oriented affair. Over G is more focused on simulation aspects, letting players control detailed versions of today's fighter planes, as well as some fancy prototype jets.   Checking the feature list on Over G definitely makes it sound impressive. There are plenty of weapon loadout customization options, a selection of wingmen with varying strengths who can be ordered around during battle, players can boost their stats playing offline or on, and there are plenty of game modes. In other words, it seems like a good choice for a flight combat fan. The problem is, despite the numerous frills and opportunities for gameplay variety, the core experience of Over G suffers from a number of problems. A lack of a sense of speed is its chief transgression.   Give me guided or give me nothing. There's a story in Over G, though most of it is entirely disposable. Players fly sorties for the Energy Air Force, a fictional outfit committed to keeping the world safe. The game offers numerous modes of play including Scenario, Challenge, and a few options for online fights. Scenario is where the story, if it can really be called that, unfolds. The game drops players into numerous locations around the globe, letting them choose missions and take out targets. Goals range from taking out planes to blasting boats and ground targets. Challenge lets players set up their own custom fight scenarios to practice their skills and try out new planes.   Despite that variety, many early missions in Over G feels like a repetition of one before. In the Far East, for instance, there are three missions where players need to take out two boat targets. The introductory mission briefing is practically identical for the three. Each mission can be beaten in two or three minutes, since they involve simply locking on to an enemy with an air-to-sea guided missile and firing. On the player's part, this involves no more than switching to the correct missiles, waiting until the range is ideal, then hitting the fire button. Mission complete, but nobody had fun. As the game progresses missions get more complicated, requiring escort duties or challenging the player to take down special targets. While becoming more complex, the missions still feel very similar to the early ones. There's no problem with over 75 missions being offered in Over G, but more variation needed to be in place to keep it interesting. A story too, for that matter.   To unlock more planes for both offline and online modes, players unfortunately have to keep trudging through the scenario muck. After each sortie a scorecard pops up reflecting combat performance. Completing only the mission objectives rarely earns good marks. Those are obtained by blowing up enemies not associated with the level goals. In missions with only two or three targets this can be done with minimal effort as there'll be lots of ammo still available. Some missions, however, require you to take down more targets than you have missiles, so wiping out any extras would require you to land at an airbase or carrier to restock or switch out weapons. Realistic? Yes. Fun? Not so much.   Tanks versus jet missile. Another option would be to command your wingmate to launch a few missiles at the enemy. This system of issuing kill orders is mostly responsive, as the wingmate for the most part successfully shoots the enemy out of the sky. Utilizing wingmates is important as the game goes on, not only because the enemy A.I. is highly aggressive and you'll need to keep them distracted, but also because the wingmates seem to be invincible. They'll occasionally call out they've been hit, but they'll still be up in the air by your side.   Even responsive, invulnerable wingmen can't propel Over G to the upper tier of Xbox 360 titles. For a game entirely focused on flying fighter jets, it's startlingly slow. Even when rocketing only a few meters above the ground at what the plane's speedometer would indicate is an eye-slicing velocity, it feels more like pushing a shopping cart up Mount Everest. Lacking a compelling sense of speed that would otherwise infuse every aspect of the game with excitement, Over G misses a big opportunity to excel.   It's really too bad Over G is such a slow game, since it otherwise has plenty of potential. Each plane model comes replete with plenty of moving parts, as well as a detailed cockpit. Airbrake flaps, landing gear, and carrier hooks extend and retract whenever engaged. Rudders for yaw and pitch are always moving around as the plane's position is perfected in the air. Grey and red out blur the screen when turning or diving at too high a speed, mimicking the blood rushing to and from the pilot's head. Stealth and hover options even exist for the F-22A and F-35B, respectively. There's plenty of detail in how everything works and it all functions well, but it surrounds such a boring kernel that it ultimately doesn't matter. Essentially this means Over G is much more suited for someone who likes to look at planes, control their flaps, make them take off and land, and maybe fire a few missiles; a collector of virtual jets.     Combat is sometimes interrupted by frustrating factors out of the player's control. The random ground fire that knocks out your engines is a good example. Most of the time you'll discover enemies are firing at you from the ground only after one of your engines goes out. After being hit, the plane's engines only operate at half power, and eventually it goes down as acceleration cuts out. This means after being hit with the seemingly randomly occurring fire from the ground, the mission needs to be restarted. Yet again it's realistic, not fun. Having this happen well into a mission will make you want to put your hand through a wall.   What the game ultimately boils down to is who fired the missile first. Strategically approaching your targets, assuming you can find them and don't get hit by random ground fire, is a good idea for the later stages and online play. If you don't fire the first missile, you're at a severe disadvantage since you'll need to spend the next few minutes snaking around in the sky, trying to avoid it. If you're successful in your evasion attempts, all chance to fight back at the pursuer will be gone since they'll have either left or still be bearing down with more missiles.   Trying to get to the chopper. Playing the Arena and Versus modes online was definitely a more entertaining experience than offline, especially since you can gain special ranks for making kills. Evidence of poor translation, which is noticeable in nearly every comment blurted out by wingmen in the single player, is obvious online as well. ~Stupidity~ is the next highest rank up from ~Greenhorn,~ for example. Anyone with Xbox Live who thinks the Scenario missions sound boring, which they are, might have fun online. Plotting attacks and battling against real people is definitely a more engaging experience. From what we played, the game handled online action well, running everything at a smooth clip.   Graphics and sound do absolutely nothing to help out the package. This might actually be the worst looking game on the Xbox 360. The planes are definitely the highlight, but can't be described as anything beyond good. Explosions are dull and simplistic, whereas the ground textures are nothing short of atrocious. In many areas the ground consists of nothing more than a flat color blob. Some blobs are dotted with PlayStation era trees, while others have office buildings sprouting up that resemble grey cardboard. The framerate doesn't stutter, but that's no surprise since there's hardly any texture information to load at all. It truly is an awful visual presentation, even with the menus and choice of text font. The animations of unit movements before missions are laughably bad, making the attempt at a storyline even more pathetic. You can, however, tilt your pilot's head around in any of the game's four views, giving you a panoramic view of the horrible landscapes.   Sage advice. The audio is nearly as poor. Character voices are awkwardly inflected. For some reason your mission orators are obsessed with telling you what time a mission starts even though it has no impact on gameplay. Before loading up Over G, it's pretty much a requirement that you completely turn the music volume to zero. It's the most grating generic rock you've likely ever heard, and might actually cause you to drop kick your own speakers in disgust. If the in game music is less listenable than the squealing drone of a jet engine, it's a strong sign something's amiss.For flight simulation fans, Over G provides a wealth of realistically detailed jets, loadout customization options, and gameplay modes. However, the game fails to generate a thrilling sense of speed. At 25,000 feet it would never look like you're going fast in relation to the ground anyway, but even down low the environments pass by lazily. The single player structures get old fast. A terrible story is complemented by repetitive mission objectives and generally uninteresting scenarios. Online play is far more engaging than the rest of the game, but the Scenario mode unfortunately requires a play through to unlock all the fancy rides. The game comes wrapped in one of the worst audio and visual packages to hit the Xbox 360, so don't buy this title with the expectations of showing off a fancy new HD set to friends. Despite the number of control options and gameplay settings, Over G Fighters rarely manages to generate excitement. If you're a simulation fan looking for something to play on the Xbox 360, this is your only option. If you're anyone else, this one's best left on store shelves.", "date": "Jul 5, 2006"}
