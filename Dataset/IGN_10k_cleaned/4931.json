He was to take his  fiance Claudia to the moon where they were to be wed far away from any misunderstood specters in poor circumstances. Unfortunately for them and the rest of the passengers aboard their Luna-bound shuttle -- let alone the inhabitants of the moon base before them -- some unruly supernatural force slammed into the spacecraft and sent them plummeting to certain death, pouring forth waves of the corporeally challenged. Richard awakens in his seat, unsure of where or even when he is... The only thing Dick knows is that he's alone, in a spacesuit, and needs to find his honey. Determined and conscious, he sets off, tromping through a fog-ridden, haunted moon base to rescue his true love. ~She's not getting out of this deal that easy,~ he thinks. ~Ghosts or not, I already booked the photographer and the florist and everything!~The fog he'll be trudging through in search of his wife-to-be plays a key role in the decline of this once fine lunar establishment. There's also a bit to learn about bizarre structures and some excavated red rock, but the fog is of paramount importance, for it is what causes nearby ghouls to go scientifically ~all crazy 'n shizz.~ This supernatural gray stuff that clings to the floors of spooky halls and haunted vegetable gardens forces Richard to haphazardly stumble about solving puzzles and ventilating rooms so that he can circumvent angry ghosts instead of just busting through every door shouting, ~Claudia, there is no escape! Till death do us part!~Richard Osmond's wife-quest is played from the first-person. Considerately, three control configurations are provided. The first, a traditionally Japanese approach to the genre, binds looking and strafing to the shoulder buttons. The second works similarly, but the third (the one to use) provides analog freelook and movement. However you opt to control it, this first-person experience is intermittently broken up by a variety of non-interactive cutscenes. For the most part, the game does remain cohesive, front to back.  Let's Just Talk Things Out The unforgiving viewpoint from behind the eyes of Rich who is himself behind the protective shield of a giant spacesuit's helmet, lends a certain appreciable degree of atmosphere and claustrophobia to the title. The feeling of uncertainty as his boots thud and clang heavily on the ground while his breath races is really something that works exceedingly well for Echo Night: Beyond. Unfortunately, it's one of the few things that works exceedingly well.While billed as a horror title, we found exploring to be scarier than any preplanned fright in the game. This is because the engine behind Echo Night is gussied up with a variety of blurred and rigid depth of field effects, smoky swirls, lingering fog, glistening walls, darkened halls, glowing panels, and moving shadows. The aesthetic candy won't surpass DOOM or even Ghosthunter, which both feature nifty torchlights of their own, but it does foster some suspension of disbelief. When stomping about and slowly navigating turn after turn and tightly organized room after room there's a real sense that at any moment Dick's head could swing back and there could stand something truly horrifying. This expected payoff to all the moody buildup, unfortunately, never happens.Most of the ghosts in the game serve either as obstructions that necessitate the completion of puzzles or dialogue mannequins to further along the story. Even the wailing little girl who tirelessly seeks her mother and causes Richard's heart to race until it stops is no more frightening than a slow moving smear of color and shade that waves its hands in the air very slowly. Let's put it this way, Echo Night may give you nightmares -- nightmares about how royally effed you might be should you find yourself marooned on the frickin' moon without a single sign of life, no escape, and no  fiance, but it won't keep you looking over your shoulder wondering when the next howling moron of a ghost happens to saunter buy going ~Ooogghhhh~ while nonchalantly dancing to music that isn't there. This lack of any substantial scare is seriously disappointing. At times, the acting, premise, and uncharacteristically mundane spiritual encounters become so tiring we found ourselves wishing the game revolved around a simple bandit takeover or maybe a bunch of loose dinosaurs or poisonous frogs or something. Instead, we get the needy, depressing ghosts who speak in riddles and with little feeling.    Once you're past the terrific graphics and see them as a delivery mechanism for the not so terrific game, and after you appreciate that you'll never really be scared despite what the thumping heart monitor and horrible in-game shrieking might lead you to believe, you'll then solve the mystery behind Echo Night. It may take a few hours to figure out, but it'll come to you. Behind the glossy presentation, replete with an abundance of slick cues and note taking considerations, and underneath the barren soundscape with its intense focus on breathing and footsteps, there is very little game to this game. Since ghosts aren't generally ones to be shot down by heavy space weaponry, there is no combat in Echo Night. The only way to bypass a ghost is to solve the puzzle its presence is designed to harden (or you can just run around in circles). The impossibility of being able to protect oneself adds a bit to the hopeless theme Echo Nights needs to preserve to deliver tension, but it does more to limit the amount of interactivity the player has. Had the puzzles turned out to be something more than simple fetch quests and plodding treks back and forth through explored areas, we might be able to forgive this lack of activity. But, aside from the rare oddity, there is not a bit of Echo Night that's genuinely challenging due to thoughtful design. There is, however, plenty that is generally frustrating due to a focus on having to methodically search every compartment of every room for that one missing keycard you happened to overlook, or that one control panel that drifted by as you jogged along. Once you spot the goods, it's a simple matter of connecting point A to B. I don't know what the switch that requires the keycard on the wall does, but since I have the card, I'd better flick it. It activated ~so and so~ that requires ~this and that,~ which I can find over there so that I can then talk to this dude who will give me this trinket. And back and forth we go, over and over. I'm So Blurry. Argh. Even this simplistic mechanism is taken to a new, boring extreme. Not only is it necessary in Echo Night to slowly move around discovering arbitrary pieces to a puzzle that shouldn't need to be solved, it's also necessary to precede every bit of exploration with a little security camera monitoring. Since ghosts cannot be outright defeated, and can frighten Dick to death in a matter of moments, spotting them by tirelessly peering through slow moving cameras is an absolute must. As a bonus that breaks up this patrol predicting monotony, accessible hot spots are spread throughout the game. These points of interest, when seen through the camera, activate flashbacks that hint at plot developments or provide clues on how to continue, as if clues were even required.All of the camera play, uninteresting spectral interactions, and sloppily pieced together conversations blanket whatever good presentational values Echo Night may have had. In fact, since you'll be so often required to mosey around the environments appreciating every nook and cranny against your will in fear of having missed some poorly placed identity card, you'll even begin dreading the graphics. While technically astounding for a PlayStation 2 title, the visuals of Echo offer little more than blandly decorated and painted walls between which a bland game takes place.Echo Night was shaping up to be a sleeper hit until we actually played through it. For shame...the engine is aptly suited to deliver a chilling experience, but since the experience happens to be about routine ghost encounters and droning fetch quests, there's little left to enjoy beyond the atmosphere.Ultimately, Echo Night is a game with terrific effects that delivers a wonderfully tense mood. But, beyond just walking about and opening cabinets, there's no reason to plod through the underdeveloped puzzles and not so frightening ghosts.", "date": "Aug 30, 2004"}
