{"name": "NHL '02", "name_review": "NHL 2002", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/09/24/nhl-2002-4", "text": "To say that EA Sports is on a roll would be a bit of an understatement. The company's two preceding releases, Madden NFL 2002 and NCAA Football 2002, each stood as the best games ever released in their respective series. And with the release of NHL 2002, the latest release in its top selling NHL Hockey franchise, it has made it three in a row, as this version is the best overall game in its hockey series.  EA Sports is often criticized for the lack of innovation in its sports games from year to year, but as was the case in both NCAA and Madden, the company has gone out of its way to improve upon the previous year's efforts in a countless number of ways. And given that NHL 2001 on PlayStation 2 was considered by many critics (though, not this one) to be the best hockey game ever, this feat is something to be commended.   Feature Set Another one of the areas where one will encounter many of these improvements is with the game's feature set. In addition to the standard play modes, such as Quick Game, Season, Playoffs, Shootout, and Tournament, NHL 2002 includes a much-needed Franchise Mode (it's not listed as Franchise, but the Season play continues on after the first year). This has been one of those play modes that have been in the Madden series for years, but has only recently began to make its way into other EA Sports franchises -- and it's an extremely welcome addition.  The Franchise supports up to 30 user-controlled teams, lasts for a total of 10 seasons, and tracks the stats of every player in the game and keeps them available for retired players. The only problem with the stat tracking is that for retired players is that it doesn't have career totals available and there aren't stats for the individual seasons played in the game, but rather a total for the stats played in the game and season records for the years leading up to the first year.  The off-season of a franchise is also somewhat limited and bare bones. The rookie draft only has a couple of rounds, the free agent signings don't allow you to make contract offers and is the likelihood of a player signing with you is up to the CPU, as it chooses who's interested and not interested in signing with your team. It's also a bit overly cumbersome to track which team has signed which player and there's no way of telling who else is after the player that you're hoping to sign.  Even with the shortcomings in the off-season aspect, the franchise mode more than serves its purpose in making the game infinitely more replayable for the truest of NHL videogame fans that will continue playing the game until their thumbs are sore. And to make things even more enticing, the franchise mode is actually tied into the game's all-new NHL Cards, as some of the tasks that earn users the points to buy a pack of 10 cards are only earned by accomplishing certain career marks, such as 500 goals or 1,000 assists with a created player.    The NHL Cards in NHL 2002 are set up similarly to the ones that have become a staple in the Madden series in that points earned by accomplishing certain tasks can be used to buy packs of cards that are made up of player and bonus cards. The difference here is that unlike Madden where the user could continue doing the same task, such as gaining 100 yards receiving and 100 yards rushing with one player, repeatedly and continue getting points for it, in NHL 2002 points are only rewarded to the task once per difficulty setting. And this works especially well because it forces the user to try and complete all of the tasks instead of just doing the ones that can be done easily -- making the completion of tasks a game in and of itself.   The cards consist of primarily player cards, which when played will give the specified player a boost, Cheat Cards, Easter Egg Cards, and Player Celebration Cards. The cheats include things like making the other team miss their next 15 shots on goal, the Easter Eggs open up stuff like big-head mode and Sumo Hockey, and the Celebration Cards open up some new after goal player celebrations to go along with the game's default user-controlled celebrations.  Beyond these modes of player, users can also look forward to a very deep create-a-player feature that lets them customize just about everything there is to adjust about a player including his eye shape and color. The only thing that's missing is the ability to put your own face in the game, which can be done with the PC version, but I guess that'll have to wait until the PS2 gets its hard drive.  Other things worth mentioning include the ability to customize teams, have a fantasy draft, edit players and even change the jersey numbers of every single player in the league. Small things, but whatever helps let the user make the game better for them is a good thing to have in a game.  Gameplay The list of improvements don't end with the feature set, either, as the most important part -- the gameplay -- has also seen a bevy of enhancements, tweaks and additions. The first of these new gameplay additions is the all-new Variable Puck Control. With this, the icon color of the player in control of the puck will get darker based on the amount of control he has on the puck. It will get darker faster if it's a player with good puck handling skills, while it'll take longer to get dark if a player with weak puck handling skills has it. This not only works as a visual cue, but it also works in changing the way you play the game as the importance of a player's ability to control the puck can be felt more than ever before.  In addition to the Variable Puck Control, users will also find some new moves at their disposal including Saucer passes. By holding down the pass button instead of just tapping it, the player will pass the puck with some air under it, allowing the puck to go over the top of sticks that might otherwise get in its path. This adds further strategy to the passing game, as doing this might get the puck over some sticks, but the downside is that it takes longer to get to the player on the receiving end.  Users also have the ability to control the game on a much deeper level by making use of the manual deke that gives them the ability to have control the movement of the stick much more precisely. By pressing down and holding the triangle button, which performs and auto deke when tapped, the player and directly move the stick with the control pad, giving them more precise control of the action, which is best seen on breakaways.  The way that one-timers work have also seen some minor changes that help make them a little more skill based on less automatic. They are still one of the best ways to put the puck in the net, but they must be timed better and more accurately for them to work. If the puck is off-target or the player is out of position, it won't just send a hard shot towards the net. Instead, the player will try and get into a better position by turning around, hit the puck with his skate to get it in position for his stick, or something similar. What this effectively does is slow down the play enough for the goalie to react and possibly save it, so one-timers aren't quite as money as they were in the past.  The game on the whole is also much more challenging as the CPU player and goalie AI have been improved greatly. You'll still be able to score in excess of 30 goals per game on the beginner and easy difficulty levels, with beginner being designed for people that have NEVER played a hockey videogame before, the challenge ramps up as you move to medium and then to difficult.     Unlike last year's game where the hardest difficulty setting didn't really put up that much of a challenge, as best shown by my ability to win my very first 21 games on the hardest setting when I first go the game, the CPU actually puts up a serious challenge this time around. If you play the game on the difficult skill level with all of the real-life rules on, such as manual line changes, off-sides, icing, etc., you will be challenged. Most games are pretty tight from beginning to end, but you'll still encounter some blowouts and you might even get your ass handed to you a time or two.   What's more, the ever-popular AI and gameplay sliders have returned, so users can setup the game precisely as they want it to be played. Case in point, the default game speed increases as you move from the beginner to difficult skill level settings. For some users, they might want the challenge of the difficult skill level but would rather have the game played at a slower speed. This is completely possible with the sliders, so the game can be setup to be played exactly how you want it to be played.   In addition to the skill level and game speed, other things that can be tweaked include fatigue, hitting power, shot accuracy, pass accuracy, pass speed, pass interceptions, and emotion effect. Plus, more advanced options such as speed burst length, speed burst %, fatigue recovery, fall recovery, aggression, shot blocking, puck elasticity, puck friction, retain puck, and puck control. The default settings work quite well for those that don't want to worry about this stuff, but it's all here for those that want to fine tune the game for their liking, and that's a very good thing.  Yet another area where the game has been improved almost tenfold is in its presentation. In addition to standard camera views, there's an all-new Breakaway cam that turns on whenever you are on a breakaway. This camera zooms in on the player with the puck with a sort of a fish-eye lens where the player is in focus and the background isn't, and the sound of the crowd will die out and is replaced by a heartbeat. It might seem a bit gimmicky, but it works well in creating an increased amount of tension on these exciting plays.   Likewise, the game makes use of these big hit and big save replays that are in-game replays that occur during game action and highlight certain big hits or big goalie saves with a couple of quick, often Matrix-like, replays of the action. The only downside to these is that it does interrupt the flow of the game and hurts the gameplay to some extent because of this. Luckily, if you like them you can leave them on completely and if you don't like them, there's a slider that you can use to turn them off.  Graphics You're also going to see some improvements over last year's game in NHL 2002's visuals. While most of the enhancements in this area are small and might not jump out at you, the biggest improvement that you're going to see is with the game's framerate. NHL 2001 suffered from quite a bit of slowdown in areas where the players would get bunched up, such as near center ice when teams were making line changes and in front of the net when players were getting knocked around. This doesn't happen at all in NHL 2002. The framerate is rock solid, silky smooth, and hella sweet.  In addition to solidifying the framerate the developers have also added a bounty of new player animations. Goalies will perform a handful of different saves that you haven't seen previously, there are a lot of new checks to see (still no knocking someone into the bench, sadly), and there are quite a few new animations for players reaching out for the puck when receiving a pass. Similarly, the puck to player contact is much more precise, so the puck will actually hit and react to different parts of the body, skates, and stick. Saves will actually hit off of a part of the goalie during most plays and not off of a zone around him.  NHL 2002 also features a new 3D animated and modeled crowd that's used during close-ups on the crowd and during some replays that show the bench. It doesn't serve a purpose with regard to enhancing the actual gameplay, but it does increase the feeling that you're in the game. Otherwise, what you're getting is pretty much what you saw last year with some slight improvements and alterations -- player models are a bit more rounded, faces are a little more human, and the lighting is a bit more refined. Nothing major, but improved.    Sound Much of the improvements to the game's audio relate to the attempt by the developers, as mentioned earlier, to increase the game's overall cinematic appeal. The game makes use of a storyteller feature that keeps track of big plays and stats throughout the game, which is then used by Jim Hughson and Don Taylor, the play-by-play commentator and color analyst, as they'll comment on big plays or feats accomplished earlier in the game. Hat Tricks will be highlighted in replays after they happen and sometimes later in the game, big players will be centered on and when a goalie is close to getting a shutout, he will be highlighted and the announcers will talk about this.   What's more, the commentators will also comment when career milestones are reached. For example, if a player hits a certain milestone, such a 500 assists, the announcers will actually mention that the player has accomplished this feat. If it's a real player, they'll say their last name, while if it's a created player, they'll say either the created player's last or first name, if either one is in the sound database (Zdyrko sadly isn't, but Dave was luckily in the first name database).  The play-by-play and color flows tremendously well, keeps up with the game pace for the most part, and offers some comedic relief. It's this part of it, though, that you're going to either love or hate. The color man provides non-stop humor and between him and the PA announcer, who will also make plenty of jokes, the game's commentary is a non-stop joke fest. There are enough samples where it doesn't really get overly repetitive, so if you like something new and different, you'll going to love what you hear. On the other hand, if you don't want to hear jokes being made throughout the game, you're going to want to turn off the color before you even start your first game because you're likely going to tire of it quickly.  Beyond the work by the announcers, NHL 2002 scores high marks for the reaction of the crowds, which are tied in more closely with what's happening on the ice. In home games, the crowd will react well to in-game actions such as big hits, saves and breakaways and not just to goals. There are a also a lot of nice sound effects for the big hits and shots, though, much of this might turn off those not in favor of using arcade-like sounds for these things.   All in all, the game's audio is quite commendable and unless you're turned off by the overly comical color commentary or arcade sound effects, you're going to love what you hear. And if you have yourself a stereo receiver that supports DTS 5.1 surround sound and an optical cable to connect your PlayStation 2 to it, you're going to get even more out of it as NHL 2002 is the first game that supports this audio format. The surround sound won't jump out at you, but you'll actually be able to tell if a defenseman is approaching you if you listen carefully and it does make a little bit of a difference in this regard. The biggest thing you'll notice, though, is that the sound when using DTS is a lot fuller, is more crisp and clear, and simply sounds a lot better.  Even though I was impressed with NHL 2001 on PlayStation 2 last year and had a lot of fun with it, I didn't agree with a lot of the praise that was handed to it by other critics and fans that it was the best hockey game ever. The game was good, but it had some major flaws including lots of slowdown and other framerate issues, the AI didn't put up a challenges for longtime NHLers, and it didn't have any of the extra play modes and features that were EA Sports' football series.Either EA Sports really took my complaints and those of their fans to heart or the developers simply knew of all the flaws from the beginning but just didn't have the time to fix or implement what they wanted last year, because NHL 2002 features improvements in all the key areas that were a problem previously. The slowdown is completely gone. The AI actually puts up a fight. The control has been finely tuned and is about as perfect as you can get and the game now has all the play modes that we've been begging for -- franchise play and the NHL Cards. It's a phenomenally deep and highly playable single player experience and the multiplayer gameplay is a enjoyable as it ever has been. Bottom line -- this is the best game ever released in the series.", "date": "Sep 24, 2001"}
