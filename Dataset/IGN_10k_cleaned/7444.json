The thumb pad and number keys, in their current state, will never offer the kind of precision control you get from a console pad or a mouse/keyboard combo. Some games compensate for this through design, but Super Happy Fun Fun looked outside the basic key config for a control scheme in their new puzzle game 3D Tilt-a-World: the camera. Most handsets are now equipped with an integrated camera and with a little bit of clever programming, games can translate image movement into a control scheme.   Super Happy Fun Fun turned to GestureTek's Eyemobile toolset for 3D Tilt-a-World's control scheme. You are charged with rolling a ball through mazes, not unlike SEGA's Super Monkey Ball franchise or those old wooden labyrinth toys. While the game does offer the option to just use the thumb pad to roll the ball, it's far more interesting to physically tilt your handset to move the ball.   There is a certain amount of nuance involved. You cannot wave your phone around wildly and hope the game catches up. In fact, if your movements are too sudden for the game to translate, nothing will happen and a note box will let you know that you need to use a little more finesse. You should also play in a well-lit area so the camera can get a good ~fix~ on an image and be able to translate that movement into the game world.   The key to getting the most out of 3D Tilt-a-World is using the brakes. Pressing the ~OK~ key brings your ball to a screeching halt. This lets you sort of recalibrate the camera, allowing it to focus on a new static image. When holding the brake, you can move the phone into a more comfortable position. I found this especially useful when I had tilted the phone away from me so much that my viewing angle was no longer useful.   3D Tilt-a-World offers up several polygonal mazes for you to roll through, bouncing off things like walls and bumpers, rolling under spinners, passing checkpoints, and collecting gems for high score attempts. Switches unlock gates. There are sections in the mazes where borders vanish and you can roll off the screen -- it's best to use the brakes in these areas. Each maze has a timer, so you need to balance your desire to pick up all the gems with crossing the finish line with time to spare.   3D Tilt-a-World is pretty much the epitome of one-button gaming, but the tilt action offers a lot of control without needing to memorize complicated button combos. Really, this is kinda like a Wii game for mobile. It's instantly accessible, but it requires a light touch to get the most out of it -- bananahands need not apply. If you're looking for a unique action-puzzler, 3D Tilt-a-World is a great download.", "date": "Oct 25, 2006"}
