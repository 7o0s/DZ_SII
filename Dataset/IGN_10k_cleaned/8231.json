The Chelski striker, infamous for falling on his face at the slightest touch, would fit perfectly in this game, because many of the world's greatest tennis pros, including Federer, Nadal and, um, Tim Henman, spend more time diving for shots than they do whacking the ball - something Drogba does week-in-week-out. In fact quite why there's so much diving in Virtua Tennis 3 is a mystery - sure, throwing your player across the court to reach a ball has always been part of the game, but here it happens every couple of shots, especially in the multiplayer game. It wouldn't be so bad if you scored points for style and finesse while falling, like figure skating in tennis whites, but all you get are grazed knees and a bruised ego when your opponent slogs another cross-court winner.   There are loads of cool practice mini-games to enjoy in the World Tour mode.  Let's put that criticism to one side for a moment though and focus on the positives Virtua Tennis 3 has to offer. Firstly, anyone familiar with the previous two will get the grasp of this sequel in an instant, because SEGA has brought its much-loved brand of pick-up-and-play arcade gameplay back to the court. Secondly, it's as authentic as any EA Sports game, boasting 20 world class pros including all the major male and female stars, as well as tournaments and stadiums from all across the globe. And finally, because Virtua Tennis 3 is a sports game with surprising depth, there's much more to it than hitting a ball around court.   Indeed, you only need to play the World Tour mode - the equivalent of a career option - for a couple of hours to get an idea of how much there is to the game. Here, players can create their own star and take them out onto the tennis circuit, playing through the lower tournaments to up their ranking before they take on the big guns. Designing your rookie ball-whacker is a fun and, because the creator is extremely flexible and easy to use, it doesn't take more than a couple of minutes. What's more, you can fiddle around with the clothes they wear and racquet they use, although you're presented with more of a choice the more you prove yourself out on the court.   Players are recognisable but have that familiar next-gen waxy sheen.  Similarly, you don't really choose the strengths and weaknesses of your player. Instead you develop their skills much like you would in an RPG, playing through a handful of refreshingly oddball practice games designed to develop the different areas of your game. Take your service for example: you can improve the strength accuracy of your serve by picking the bowling mini-game, in which you must knock over the skittles with hard, well-placed shots. The more you knock down, the more experience you're awarded and so your player levels up. It the same process for developing your stroke and volley play, although here you're bursting balloons, hitting targets and even fending off hungry alligators, all in the name of progression. Finally, to improve speed and agility around the court you face an avalanche of giant tennis balls, which need to be avoided while grabbing fruit at the same time.   The mini-games are both varied and fun, with over a dozen different challenges to get stuck into. What's more, they really add another dimension to the game, because while all you really do is smack a ball (at a group of advancing aliens, at oil cans, at skittles - pretty much anything, really) each one really does feel different from the next. It's also clever the way they're incorporated into your training schedule, which then fits into the tennis World Tour calendar. Each practice session takes up a week of your calendar, so you only have a certain amount of time to work on different areas of your game before the next tournament. Of course, you're not forced to enter tournaments and can instead keep on practicing, but your seeding only increases when you win competitions and some of the later challenges - like doubles games and playing against the best opposition - can only be entered if you're a high-ranking player.     In practice, sailing up to a seeding of around 100 is a breeze and really the opening half of the World Tour only serves as an extravagant tutorial, because your opponents rarely play challenging shots meaning you'll win the first few tournaments with ease and have spare time to build up your skills. You'll also receive better equipment, because performance-enhancing gear - like better racquets - are awarded every time you win a tournament.   However, once you reach the top seeds, the characteristics of the big players really come into play, with Roddick relying on his powerful serve and Federer playing a great all-round game. This is where the real challenge lies and, if you put in the time and effort to get good at VT3, it's where you'll get the most reward. Admittedly you can play against the best in a one-off exhibition match or even prove your worth by competing in the Tournament mode, which features four major competitions. But there's nothing quite like creating your own player and then watching them rise to the top, all because of your skills out on the court.   The court detail is spot on, both visually and the way the ball bounces.  Which brings us neatly back to our original point. When you're up against the best players in the game, who constantly keep you on the move by playing the ball to opposite corners of the court, you can't help but get annoyed by how often your player will dive for the ball. This is because, like VT2, you can charge up your return while getting into position, but rather than waiting until you lift off the button to reply, your player takes the first available shot - which often results in them flying across the grass.   Sure, you can hold back from playing a shot until your player is perfectly positioned, but we can't help wish it played more like the original Virtua Tennis, which felt more precise and gave superior control to the player. You'll notice it in multiplayer too, especially when you're competing against someone who's more skillful at hitting hard returns, which is a shame because otherwise it's a great blast for up to four players.   Pick up the fruit while dodging the giant tennis balls.  Well, it is if you stick to the game's default controls and give the SIXAXIS tilt control a wide berth. Playing by moving the pad around probably sounded like a great idea at the design stage, more so when Wii Tennis came out, but here it's poorly implemented and almost impossible to use effectively. This is because there are too many controls mapped onto the different tilt functions of the SIXAXIS: angling the pad to move your player in that direction is simple enough, but then you have to jolt it to play the shot (which can affect your position) and then tilt it in the direction you want to aim. We managed a few successful serves and returns, but it's simply not accurate enough to warrant any more than a quick go for curiosity's sake.Overall, Virtua Tennis 3 is decent stab at reclaiming the series former glory but its by no means the killer game it once was. Much of the charm has been lost in the translation from the original game to PS3 and while visually its infinitely better  it looks great in 1080p, with stacks of detail and slick animation  its all a bit soulless. The fact that the players, while recognisable, have that zombie-like next-gen look to them doesnt help and its all too easy to not really care what happens on the court. Creating your own player and working your way through the World Tour mode gives the game more character and we absolutely love the training mini-games, but theres no glossing over the fact that Virtua Tennis 3 doesnt play the same great game as its predecessors.
