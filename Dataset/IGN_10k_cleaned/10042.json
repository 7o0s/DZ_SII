Golf games can be just as realistic as any other sports games, but they're still just golf games. Maybe if they came with golf-cart bonus rounds, so you could race around the green between tees, ripping up the grass and pissing off the groundskeeper. Now that would be cool.  All monkey shines aside, World Cup Golf is a decent golf game. The usual options are all in place, and the interface is easy enough to use, but it's difficult to see where you're supposed to aim, on the tee off and when putting. You can change the hot spot on your meter, so you have something to aim at on those half swings, which is nice. The putting, however, is more of a guessing game than anything, as there's no grid to help you out.  The graphics are great, as far as golf games go, but great graphics never carried a weak game. Overall, World Cup Golf is mediocre at best.   Douglass Perry", "date": "Nov 27, 1996"}
