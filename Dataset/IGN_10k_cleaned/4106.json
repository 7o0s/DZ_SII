{"name": "Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup", "name_review": "Quidditch World Cup", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/03/quidditch-world-cup", "text": "The moment Harry Potter took to the skies on his broom as House Gryffindor's seeker is when a collective plea from Potter fans everywhere was heard: we want Quidditch! Electronic Arts toyed with the idea, twice on the Game Boy Advance, reducing the sport as minor mini-challenges in Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. But this year, with no film to piggy-back upon, EA Games puts all its Potter efforts into recreating Quidditch as a realized sport, at least as a videogame rendition. The task certainly must have been daunting since the sport is only possible in a fictional world...but then, many things players do in videogames can't be recreated in real-world examples. Still, in its first generation, Quidditch World Cup is a decent first try, but there's definitely room for improvement since, like the Quidditch mini-games in the Harry Potter adventures, it's still a simplified rendition that lacks the depth needed to pass off as a true sport. Features Four difficulty levels Nine international teams Collectable Wizard cards Link cable support for two players Cartridge save (three slots) Connectivity with the GameCube version  The game of Quidditch, established by JK Rowling in her Harry Potter series of novels, and then more recently realized in some action-packed sequences in the first two Harry Potter films, borrows a little bit from many different sports, from soccer to rugby...and even features just a little hockey and basketball. Then, it throws the players onto flying broomsticks and sets 'em loose in an airborne playing field where they'll have to get the quaffle (the main ball) through one of three of a set of hoops on the opposite side of the field. Each successful toss through the hoop lands that team ten points, with the game ending when the team's seeker grabs the quick-as-lightning snitch, a winged, walnut-sized orb that zips around the playing field...earning that team 150 points in the process. All this has to be done by dealing with the other team's chasers, beaters, and keeper as well.  Realistically, the sport is only possible in the Land of Make Believe. But Electronic Arts put development teams on the idea of making Quidditch as real as possible, and by sticking to the rules. Whether or not the development team was restricted to how it could portray the sport in its rules and regulations, the game doesn't offer anything new in terms of gameplay that wasn't done in the films or books. That should definitely please purists of the Harry Potter series, but it may have taken its toll on making the game ~fun,~ at least on the Game Boy Advance.  The main problem is that there's not much to do beyond passing, stealing and shooting the quaffle into the hoops. This becomes very, very easy to do early in the game since the AI is just a bit of a pushover, even when the difficulty challenge increases during the World Cup mode. Quidditch World Cup is also intended as a game for the younger crowd, so the action has been kept as simple as possible for this target audience. Even though it's airborne, is limited to a single horizontal plane during the action, so players can't accidentally change altitude for any reason. On the Game Boy Advance, it's also impossible to change control to a particular player manually...the game chooses which chaser is player controlled...and it changes on the fly as the quaffle's passed around. The controls are, admittedly a little sluggish, giving off that ~Sore Thumb~ syndrome due to subconsciously pressing the D-Pad harder and harder as if it's going to make your on-screen character move faster. The game's speed increases as you earn faster brooms, but it still feels like it needs a little more ~oomph.~ Another complaint: beaters rarely come into play at all, reduced to simply a ~special ability~ players can call upon to knock a player unusable for a couple of seconds. And honestly, the way it's handled, it's not really that needed in the game. Quidditch World Cup's balance does change in favor of the computer deeper into the game as it starts taking advantage of special shots that automatically score regardless of where they're performed in the arena, but most of the time the game does boil down to the one huge flaw of the sport of Quidditch: the Snitch Chase. As cool as it is to watch and play, it's annoying that, 90% of the time, everything that's been done in the standard game is completely thrown out the window in favor of this action-packed sequence that ends the game. Unless you're more than 150 points ahead (which would be considered a blow-out in any other sport), and since the main game comes to a complete halt during this sequence, the other player can win in just a couple of minutes. Now, the developers do a little balancing in favor of the leading team by giving him additional speedboosting abilities, but the win can be stolen away quite easily if you're not following the Snitch path as precisely as the other player. It's an element that would be much better off without the points inflation. Fifty points? Sure. A hundred and fifty points? That's the equivalent of 15 goals during regulation play. Ridiculous. This is an element that will never change, unfortunately, unless the next Potter book changes the rules to accommodate a better balance between teams and scoring. And I don't see that happening.   The Game Boy Advance version of Quidditch World Cup has been handled by Magic Pockets, a European GBA developer that's been continuously proving itself this year alone with some solid handheld projects. Quidditch utilizes a decent 2D engine with plenty of scrolling layers and on-screen sprites that scale in relation to the game's camera...with a bit of slowdown when the action gets a little too heated for the engine to handle. It also features a very quick and smooth Mode 7 engine for the Snitch chase that's also employed in the awesome GameCube connectivity feature; hooking up the game to the GameCube version of Quidditch World Cup will give console players a ~co-op~ mode that essentially puts the GBA gamers in the role of the Seeker exclusively. And as the game continues on the console, players can close or extend the gap with standard quaffle goals as the Seeker does his job. It's a mode exclusive on the GameCube and Game Boy Advance, and definitely worth it if you've got both versions.  But the game lacks a certain depth necessary in a sports game. The developers attempt to add something to a somewhat hollow game design with the standard Harry Potter Wizard Card collection, awarding players cards (some with special abilities) by performing specific tasks. It adds to the replay value, sure, but the special abilities awarded don't make the game that much deeper.   Quidditch World Cup on the Game Boy Advance isn't bad, especially since the development is a solid one on the GBA. The link between it and the GameCube version, for example, is a really great example of connectivity. But it is admittedly a shallow game design  and leaves a lot of room for improvement if it wants to really establish itself as a sport. And maybe that's the designers' intention, to make the game a series much like the games in the EA Sports franchise. Before they crack down on the next generation, though, a lot of rethinking has to be done about the rules, or at least the points-balancing between teams during the Snitch chase. It's an admirable first attempt, but yes, a drastically improved 2004 version is definitely in order.", "date": "Nov 3, 2003"}
