{"name": "Bomberman World", "name_review": "Bomberman World", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/10/08/bomberman-world", "text": "Bomberman's evolved many times over the years, starting from the days when he was known as Atomic Punk. Well, the PlayStation's finally got him and his bombs, and while he may look a little different on the surface, he's got the classic gameplay we all know him for.  The PlayStation version, Bomberman World, tips the familiar overhead perspective in a more 3D, isometric angle. There's two ways to play the game: for one-player modes, the idea is to plant bombs along the playfield to destroy objects and enemies, and wander around to collect gems to advance in the levels.  While the one player game is certainly deep enough, Bomberman was never about solitaire play. It's about five players duking it out in an enclosed arena  this is where the series shines. Strategically plant bombs to trap your opponents, and let a bomb blow straight in his face. The last man standing is the winner. That's the name of the game. The multiplayer mode is all about variety  there's many different locations and each has its own unique element that adds a twist to the gameplay. Forget those Bomberman games that have arrived on the N64. This is the real deal  almost. I still prefer playing Super Bomberman 2 on the Super NES simply because the balance is a little better, the graphics aren't overly complex, and you don't have to sit through appalling loadtimes. The one-player quest mode is just as lame as it has been on other systems, but the multiplayer mode (which also can be played by a single player) is what you really want to play. But only play with other friends, since the computer has the upper-hand. It knows exactly when a bomb will explode, and how big the explosion is, so it knows exactly where to stand. Talk about unfair AI.It's a good Bomberman title, and Hudson didn't try to push the game over the top. Still, the classic Bomberman titles on the SNES are the better bet", "date": "Oct 8, 1998"}
