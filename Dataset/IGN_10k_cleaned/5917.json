The latest is Rainbow Six: Lockdown, which is a sequel to 2004's Rainbow Six 3. The game offers multiple expansions on the concepts introduced in preview Rainbow Six editions, as well as some sharper visuals, but there are also a few stagnant spots where Rainbow Six: Lockdown feels like the rare Gameloft game that came from the formula farm.   Rainbow Six: Lockdown chronicles a dastardly action from the People's Liberation Front (GLF) and the Rainbow's team's efforts to bring the militants down. A lethal virus is in play and intel reports point to a possible attempt to unleash the bad bugs at a United Nations summit. However, Rainbow has some problems of its own it needs to sort through, as the GLF is determined not to let the team thwart their plans. In order to effectively target the GLF, you must reassemble the team, which has been scattered.   To say there is some killing in Rainbow Six: Lockdown is something of an understatement. Before you've capped off the last of eight levels, you will have forced the GLF to implement another membership drive. From stealth attacks that slit throats to full frontal assaults, the bodies will hit the floor. And in that respect, there is a certain thrill to Rainbow Six: Lockdown that will appeal to more traditional gamers. (Not the death part, per se, but the constant action.)   However, it does take a little work to cause said carnage. Most of the GLF thugs are on rails. They have assigned routes they traverse and you must somehow figure out how to eliminate them one by one without raising too much alarm, lest the whole country come down on you. Either that, or one of the hostages that you have been instructed to rescue will be summarily executed the moment you are detected. The entire game isn't dominated by stealth actions like this, but a good portion of it is. Discerning the best way to neutralize these terrorists as they go about their patrols isn't entirely unlike a puzzle game. Just a puzzle game with bug guns and sliced throats. Some players will really dig these sequences -- others may get frustrated by the number of times they have to replay a scene to get the sequence right.   You will have some regular firefights between these stealthier missions, such as a river cruise with your team on a boat. You blast GLF nasties on bridges and such. There are also interior fight sequences where you engage the enemy directly, firing over barricades at individual troops or vehicles. The sniping sequences are also good, as you look through the scope of a rifle at your prey. I liked these sequences as a respite from some of the harder puzzle-like stealth missions. Sometimes, as any gamer knows, you just gotta blow stuff up.   Now, there is a total killjoy mission in Rainbow Six: Lockdown that I am not alone is wondering how the hell it got in the game. There is a helicopter strafing run over a city that should have been a great shooter level, complete with fast action and high-flying thrills. It's no. The sequence is clumsy, to say the least. Somebody tried to push the helo too fast through the richly detailed cityscape, and the game just cannot keep up. Shooting accuracy is ruined and I wonder if more than a handful of gamers won't jettison Rainbow Six: Lockdown after trying to get through this scene.   As with all Gameloft games, Rainbow Six: Lockdown has excellent presentation. The detailed levels look great, with good use of color. The character designs, from those engaged in thuggery to the Rainbow team to the newscaster that follows the action are all well done. The music is also quite good, and there is more than enough sound effects to pepper the scenes of urban combat.  Rainbow Six: Lockdown is a good entry into the series. I appreciated Gameloft's expanded vision for the game, even if some of the chances taken did not pay off (re: helicopter scene). But there are also a few ~same-y~ spots, such as the stealth missions that occasionally bleed together. The game offers significant play time, which makes it an excellent value. While I would still recommend Gameloft's Prince of Persia and Splinter Cell Chaos Theory over Rainbow Six: Lockdown, fans will still be sated.", "date": "Aug 9, 2005"}
