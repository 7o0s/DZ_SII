{"name": "The Longest Journey", "name_review": "The Longest Journey", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/21/the-longest-journey", "text": "Months and months after its European release, The Longest Journey is finally making it to America -- and not a second too soon, either. Just in time for the Holiday season, this is a perfect gift, and one of the most polished adventure titles ever made. Like critical faves like Grim Fandango, this game does more than just recreate the nostalgic experience of old school adventure gaming, it actually reinvents how stories can be told in the medium, and gives us a glimpse of what we can expect in the years to come.   As April Ryan, you're the average art student in the future, recently transported to the big city in order to pursue your art career. You've got a great life -- good friends, a nice room at a boarding house, and a good job at the local caf. And you have dreams. Lot of weird, vibrant, too-real-to-not-be-real dreams about dragons, the destruction of the world, and your future. In the course of this long adventure you'll begin to take part in a journey over two parallel worlds, one of technology, the other of magic, and find your ultimate place in bringing the two worlds back together. Like any good adventure game, there's tons of story involved, as well as a multitude of characters and creatures to interact with along the way. But TLJ goes beyond what you expect from your average adventure title, giving you a much more mature, deep experience that truly puts you in an epic adventure of feature film sized proportions. I could talk about it a lot more, but that's what previews are for. Check out our info if you want more details on the life and times of miss Ryan.  Once you get into the game and its structure, you'll be met with a truly classic piece of adventure gaming. You've got your inventory, your odd objects to combine, and your clickable environment just waiting for you to use with specific items. That means that all the frustrations are there as well, like missing an object earlier that stops you from progressing, or missing a specific branch of a conversation that hold the specific clue you need to progress in the story. For the most part, however, irritations are kept to the minimum. Hot areas of the screen are easy to find with your mouse, most puzzles are fairly logical in nature, and conversations usually keep important information up front. You move through environments pretty quickly, which keeps things fresh -- and more often than not, most puzzles are made up of key items from nearby screens, which helps to keep the frustration factor down. Funcom has made the interface easy to use, kept an in-game diary in order to keep you up on the plot points, as well as reveal key parts of April's past, and even found an ingenious way to put in a secret puzzle that unlocks special outtakes from the game. Now when did an adventure game every do that for you?  Since this is an adventure game, the story's really what will keep you going through the game, or pushing through an especially annoying puzzle. You're in it as much to find out the next chunk of the mystery as you are to get to the next puzzle segment of the game, and in that respect The Longest Journey delivers like no other game before. When you think ~boy, this is sort of a far-fetched situation~ in the game, you'll usually notice April saying the same thing out loud in the scene as well. Other than a few incredibly inane puzzles (make sure to push past the horrible ~let's create a scary shadow puzzle~ in the first disc before you think of writing off TLJ), most of the time you'll put April through her paces like a normal human being. Ignore the fact that she can't remember where she put her own subway card, and you'll find that it's a pretty damn cool thing to be able to experience what real life might be like in the future, and in a fantasy setting. A lot of April's experiences focus on self-discovery as much as they do about progressing to the next screen, or triggering the next large event. It's almost foreign to have a main character in a video ask questions about their mortality and existence, but April Ryan's humor-driven look at life seems to be able to pull off such topics without ever dragging down the story, or blurring the TLJ's strong gaming focus. When characters converse, it's as much about talking about their lives as it is about getting the next clue for the next puzzle... and while that might sound boring, it's really not. You'll care about the characters in the game, you'll be interested in what's going to happen to them, and you'll be waiting to see how the characters will fit into the story as the mystery unravels. You'll wonder how Ryan's going to convince a hack with a hovering wheelchair how to help you tackle one of the largest corporations on the planet, but at the same time you'll be just as concerned with her assaultive neighbor who just won't take no for an answer. The same way that the Final Fantasy has grabbed gamers by delivering a well-rounded RPG with tons of character development, The Longest Journey goes even farther by given you the development, as well as realistic dialogue -- that means adult content, harsh subject matter, and some big time swearing mixed in with all of the classic stuff you've come to love about adventure games. Not that I'm saying that somehow swearing instantly makes this game mature, but it's nice to see a game where the characters actually act and react like the average person, without being toned down. Think of this as the HBO of adventure games, and you've got a pretty good idea of what to expect.   The pre-rendered backgrounds are full of incredible details, and mix animation with still CG work to make the backgrounds a lot more interactive than your average adventure title. Grass will flow in the wind, waves with animate, rise and fall when you're on a ship, environments will shift shapes... it's all as consistently impressive as the storyline. As for the CG, there's lots of it, and for the most part, it blends in well with the key events in the game. Funcom has opted to include a lot of short segments instead of a few gigantic key sequences, something that really helps to keep things moving, and keep you interacting with the game as much as possible. As for music, it's a pretty lush affair with a fully orchestrated score that covers everything from major cutscenes to incidental moments in the game. An inane amount of voice acting fills out the sound, most of it incredibly above par, with a few sludgy exceptions. April is especially charming, sounding straight out of a Kevin Williamson script with her wry and sly commentary on the events in her crazy, fantasy-filled life.  The Longest Journey isn't necessarily new in terms of gameplay -- if you've played a LucasArts or Sierra adventure title, The Longest Journey will feel instantly familiar. What makes TLJ shine so brilliantly is the fact that it hones the genre into its tightest, sharpest form yet. When gamers talk about the future of gaming being more like movies than like Pong, I'd like to think that that has as much to do with maturing characters and storylines as it has to do with more polygons and pixels. In that respect, The Longest Journey is one of the biggest glimpses we've had at that future yet, and also one of the most satisfying and long adventures I've been able to experience in a long time. As a fan of good gaming, you owe it to yourself to give this one a try.  -- Vincent Lopez      Want to share your opinions with the world?
