But the solution to this problem isn't to deny games like Midnight a seat at the big game, but to start the necessary transition of moving older games in crowded (but no less essential) genres off the decks completely to make room for newer games that offer increased functionality and game play options.   As expected Midnight Hold 'Em Poker is an excellent production -- this is Gameloft, after all. The Midnight series of games have shown uniform quality, and this addition to the brand umbrella doesn't let anybody down. From the opening licensed jingle -- Average White Band's ~Pick Up the Pieces~ (heard in ~Ocean's 11~) -- to the hand drawn portraits for each hustler around the table, the game bleeds class. Beyond the window dressing, you have a very playable game of Texas Hold 'Em, which has admittedly been done to death on cellphones. The rules of the game are likely familiar to anybody that owns a television, as pop culture was absolutely inundated with poker last year. I have yet to play a truly awful game of poker on mobile since the game is actually pretty hard to screw up, even for the laziest mobile developer, and this title does not break the streak.   So, since Midnight Hold 'Em Poker offers the same game as most other Texas Hold 'Em titles, it is judged on all the extra goodies it contains and how everything is presented. The game offers a few different approaches. You can jump right in with an instant game for the quick pick-up. There is a career mode which starts you at the cheapest table imaginable, but if you manage to wipe out all comers, you move up to more and more exclusive games where the blinds and bets are bigger. The beginning of the career mode is easy -- AI is snappy, but not exceedingly clever. However, move on to the next couple tables, and you'll start seeing riskier plays that make you think twice about going all-in without a sure thing. You can also play one-on-one games with in-game characters for more focused grudge matches.   The other players all have individual looks to them -- this has always been one of the strongest features of the Midnight brand. Their personality shines through with expressions and comments and makes you feel like you're sitting at the table with mildly real people. Granted, you won't see the kind of craziness you'll find when you play with actual people in MFORMA's online World Poker Tour game, but there is something to be said for playing against sharks that actually have definitive strategies. Playing against real people can be so iffy -- some play smart and cool, others play like absolute morons and ruin a game.   Controlling your hands in Midnight Hold 'Em Poker is quite simple. As the action moves around the table, you see what people are betting and doing. When it comes to you, a simple menu in the corner of the screen lets you raise, call, or fold. When it is your turn to deal, however, you are given the option to actually cheat a little. You can peek at some cards and the flop from time to time, but overusing this feature can ruin the game, in my opinion. Use it at your own risk.  Midnight Hold 'Em Poker brings nothing new to the table -- but it does so in a genre where innovation is not required. Texas Hold 'Em is an established game, and I doubt any gamers want somebody monkeying with it too much. What matters then is presentation and play options. Even though the game is called Midnight Hold 'Em Poker, I do wish there were more games in there than just Texas Hold 'Em -- that would offer a huge value. But the Midnight setting is excellent, the look of the game is exceptionally clean (cards, menus, etc. are easy to read and navigate), and the AI seems on the ball. If you already have a Texas game you are happy with, the need to buy in again is negligible, but if you are a newcomer and online play means little to you, Midnight Hold 'Em Poker is a smart package.", "date": "Feb 24, 2006"}
