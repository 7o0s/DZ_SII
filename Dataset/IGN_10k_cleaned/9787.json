Everything we missed in the GBC version is here.  Features  Two-player game. Four game modes. Special pieces: Star Bubble, Metal Bubble, Spoiler Bubble and Spoiler Block. Saves player initials and best times. Eight difficulty modes in the options menu  Compatible with NeoGeo Pocket and NeoGeo Pocket Color.   The Game SNK knows what every fan of the Bust-A-Move (aka Puzzle Bobble) series has known since the addictive puzzler took arcades by storm: It's about competition. Whereas the last Game Boy Color Bust-A-Move game had many of the important BAM features and fun single-player gameplay, Bust-A-Move Pocket wisely brings back the heart-and-soul of the franchise. Even if you don't have a friend with a second NeoGeo Pocket, a second copy of the game and a link cable (we suggest you find one, though), the game keeps the competitive spirit going through the simple fact that you can save your best times. There's nothing better than smashing your brother's or co-worker's latest records, gradually pushing their name out of the top 3.  There are four modes that all follow the same basic concept. Shoot colored bubbles from the bottom of the screen towards the top and try to align three of the same color to make them pop. Special bubble blocks, such as the Star Bubble or the Metal Bubble help or hinder you from achieving your goal. In Puzzle Mode, players try to clear the screen as quickly as possible, Vs-CPU is a battle against different computer opponents, Survivor is all about how long you can go without drowning in bubbles and Vs-Player has you go head-to-head against a human opponent via the link cable (you can also pick from three difficulty settings in this mode). Control of the bubble shooter is a cinch thanks to the NGP's nice thumb stick. B shoots, pushing left or right adjusts the degree, pushing up makes the shooter perpendicular and holding A while moving allows for more subtle adjustments.  Unlike with Acclaim's latest Bust-A-Move for Game Boy Color, the developers made sure that the game displays different colors for all the eight basic bubbles without the use of patterns. It's still sometimes tough to tell apart pink from orange (especially in bad lighting conditions) and the bubbles could move a little smoother, but it's already a giant step forward from the GBC version. Music and sound effects are directly based on the arcade unit (no, there's no ~bakaaaaaahk!~ here either), with the same memorable (and eventually mind-numbing) happy bubble tunes. Someone finally did the Taito puzzle classic justice and created a competent multi-player handheld version. The graphics are still as simple as can be, but the use of color suits the game well and the gameplay is dangerously addictive. I wish the Vs-CPU Mode was longer  luckily, there are plenty of puzzles to keep players occupied, even without a partner to compete with. For true bliss, find a sunny spot in the park, link two NeoGeos together and find out what ~once you pop, you can't stop~ is really all about.", "date": "Jul 20, 1999"}
