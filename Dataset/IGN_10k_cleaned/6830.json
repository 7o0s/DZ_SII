Monkeys with knives. Rain of blood. A witch that attacks with flying hearts. A dude that takes a sword to the forehead and walks away clean. Some crazy dancing line drawing guy in the corner of the screen at all times. Not five minutes went by where I didn't utter the words, ~What the hell is going on here?~ But alas, that is the essence of Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked, and somewhere deep within its crazy-ass soul, there's quite a bit of guilty pleasure to be found.   Acting as something of a ~lost episode~ of the series, Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked sees our three (anti)heroes take an extended detour on their way to Nagasaki. After taking the wrong boat in order to grab some much-needed food and sleep, Fuu, Jin and Mugen find themselves in the middle of a frozen wasteland in the northern end of Ezo. Mugen promptly does battle with some kind of snake-wielding witch and is separated from Fuu and Jin for a bit, which sets up the separate paths of their misadventures.    While Mugen, Fuu and Jin do meet up again in a short bit, Mugen and Jin embark on separate-yet-connected adventures. This ties into the game's multiple storylines, wherein you're able to choose either Mugen or Jin (or a third, unlockable character) and play through separate story trees. Many of the levels cross over where one character will either meet up with the other or even show up either before or after the other and maybe even see the level structure play out in a different manner, but there are connections. Some sections are unique to each character, like Mugen's 2D world or the forest area at the start of Jin's storyline, which helps diversify the game between each samurai and make each story path a unique experience. Cool stuff.   It's not just the story paths that differ either, but the way the two characters play are quite different. Mugen is rather unconventional with regards to his move set, employing a variety of refined yet wild sword slashes intermixed with some breakdancing melee combat. Jin, on the other hand, features much more classic samurai moves, each strike slicing through the air with utmost precision, and many of his combos end with Jin re-sheathing his sword like a true samurai pimp. Even their basic movement is different, such as how Mugen can jump like 15 feet while Jin will roll instead. Chaotic and aggressive movement vs. refined and relaxed, in other words.    The differences in their two styles are fairly cool, though since it mostly comes down to style rather than strength or speed, the difference winds up being mostly visual. It does tie into which combos you'll use as many of Jin's styles revolve around a few quick hits with multiple big hits to finish them off while Mugen can happily slash quickly at will, but really the actual mechanic here isn't much different than switching between records.   Switching records is a pretty cool part of the game and really does mix things up quite a bit. Samurai Champloo is very much tied to its hip-hop soundtrack, and in the case of the game the music actually dictates the fighting move set you currently have available. You're able to assign two current records at any one point, and flicking the right stick will switch between the two active records and change your moves. Basically it's a shift in your combo tree and available attacks. Essentially, you have the same individual moves on most any record, but each record strings them together in a different manner. Major changes might be that one record features long strings of heavy attacks while another focuses on quick attacks. On top of this, some of the records give you attribute bonuses for using them, like increased defense or what have you.    Since you're able to acquire new records throughout the course of the game either via purchasing or earning them, you'll constantly have new attack combos to perform and even new music to boot. It does pretty well to change up the feel of the game the whole way through, and the fact that there isn't really a definitive ~best~ or ~worst~ record out there, managing which records you use feels like more of a customized experience rather than something of a necessary upgrade in order to progress. It all works pretty well.   As you'll constantly wind up with new moves to use, in order to help things feel less random you'll see your current attack string featured at the top of the screen. This works excellently in helping you run through specific and/or new combos, but it takes away from the action on the battlefield a fair bit as you'll find yourself looking at the attack tree as much as you do the action at hand.    One thing that amplifies this is the hyper attacks you'll earn. By building up your tension meter by basically slashing the crap out of folks, you'll be able to trigger the hyper attack mode by executing a certain (randomly selected) combo. This sounds fine, but since the combo changes, you'll constantly refer to the top of the screen to see which combo you need to pull off and simply press the appropriate buttons as you work up the combo tree until it's unleashed. In other words, you'll be focusing on the combo tree and not the combat.   One really cool part of the combat however is its counter system. Should you and one of your opponents attempt to strike each other simultaneously, you'll be presented with a quick mini-game where anywhere from one to four of the face buttons will appear on-screen. If you press any of the shown buttons in time, you'll initiate a counter-attack and take out the enemy, the type of counter depending upon which button you pressed. If you miss, the enemy will counter you instead.    With all of these cool (and bad) segments of the fighting system, it really is what the game relies on for fun as it's an extremely linear experience where you'll simply wander down a predefined path and kill whoever appears in front of you. Unfortunately, the enemy AI is really quite dumb and will basically stand around and wait for you to kill it. Luckily the combat system is rather fun, if imperfect. Still though, if you're looking for more meat to the game rather than killing foe after foe and witnessing extremely odd moments, this isn't the game for you.   As mentioned, Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked is a completely cracked-out experience, part of which makes its way into a bonus mini-game of sorts in the combat system. After killing enough foes and filling your tension meter, one of the enemies on the level will spawn with a star above his head. If you hit him once, you'll enter a Tate mini-game where you're presented in front of a backdrop and you and your foe approach each other in slow-motion. One of the four face buttons will appear, and if you hit the correct one in time you'll then begin to slash the holy crap out of him by mashing all of the face buttons as quickly as possible. If you hit him 100 times before the time runs out (usually only a couple seconds), you'll then head into the Trance state where foe after foe will run into a small room and you'll chop them down in succession. While in the Trance state, all of the characters are presented as silhouettes in front of a colored background as overly happy techno plays in the background. It's extremely odd and surreal and draws quick comparisons to part of the Crazy 88 swordfight in Kill Bill.    On top of this madness, you'll find sections of the story where you'll talk to (and fight) monkeys, travel through space, compete in a sno-cone eating contest and other such odd moments. Some of the dialogue is simply funny as hell, so absurd that you can't help but laugh. It's an extremely stylistic game, with everything from elements of the combat to the dialogue and storyline feeling entirely out of place and perfectly aligned at the same time. In other words, it's great.   There are some sections of the presentation that are a little sub-par however, like certain bits of cutscene editing. Some sections just sort of drag on without hitting the punch line quick enough, or weird pauses and such fill space that could have been trimmed out. Overall it's pretty good, but there are a few marred spots.    Related somewhat to the presentation, the game's camera can pose a problem at times. Sidetracked uses a static camera that usually doesn't pose a problem during battle, but when you're roaming about or switching rooms or walkways it'll flip in an extremely odd manner at times. It also sometimes prevents you from being able to see doors correctly, though thanks to an on-screen map you usually won't have a problem figuring out where to go.   Visually speaking, Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked is a pretty lackluster title, though it does work. The main characters resemble their animated counterparts quite well, even if they aren't the most detailed things in the world. Their animation set is generally pretty decent with fluid combat moves, though they may bring stick figure animations to mind. In other words, they look stiff yet fluid at the same time, which I suppose matches the animated series.   The enemies and scenery are rather bland, however, in terms of both animations and overall visual fidelity. Most every enemy shares the same hunched-over ~ready to kill~ pose and simply sway back in forth until they attack. Detail is pretty poor overall with plenty of hard edges to objects and such that make the game look a little harsh. It's not enough to kill the total experience, but it's certainly not what we'd call a good looking game.Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked provides an overall fun experience simply because of its reasonably fun combat system and its totally whacked out sense of humor. There are enough aspects of it that some may find to be game killers, like the camera system, visuals or even some of its unrefined presentation, but it is quite fun in the end and fans of the series (or oddball humor) should check it out.", "date": "Apr 12, 2006"}
