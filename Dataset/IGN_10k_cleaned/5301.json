IN-FUSIO's new racer, launching on Sprint PCS this week, attempts to recreate a two-player race to the finish. However, rather than having two gamers actually compete in real-time (sending those data packets over current networks with these handsets isn't practical), IF Racing Head 2 Head uses a ~ghosting~ system that allows you to upload your best race times and paths. Then, other players can download your runs and challenge them as if you were playing together.   N-Gage tried this system to little success with earlier on-line games, like Tomb Raider and Tony Hawk. IN-FUSIO's game meets with slightly better results.   Using your thumbpad, you race a Formula 1-style car through a series of appropriately curvy tracks. The control itself is fairly decent and responsive, but as an amateur racer, you will find yourself off-course from time to time. While in the dirt, your car takes damage -- which leads to an explosion so big you would think your car had rocket fuel in the tank.   As a single-player game, IF Racing Head 2 Head isn't terribly compelling. The computerized racers play it safe most of the time, allowing you to pull off some easy wins. You can use your winnings to upgrade your vehicle, but you'd really have to sit their and study the frame rate to be able to discern if your car is going al that much faster with the digital tuning.   Things get better when you do attempt a multiplayer game. There are many ghost files to download, although we wonder if they are from real players or ghost files IN-FUSIO uploaded themselves. Regardless, IF Racing Head 2 Head's multiplayer mode at least tries to introduce a new wrinkle to the old round-and-round. The only catch, though, is that when you race a ghost file, you are the only other racer on the track. This really eliminates some of the challenge, no matter how tight of a racer uploaded their ghost.  If you asked me what the biggest drawback is to IF Racing Head 2 Head, it would have to be just how dated the game looks compared to many of the other racers on handsets today. Even some of IN-FUSIO's own efforts. Their upcoming Midtown Madness 3 Mobile would run circles around this racer.If you are a big racing fan, IF Racing Head 2 Head is a pretty decent download. The ghosting feature doesn't offer ~real~ multiplayer gaming, but it's an acceptable approximation for right now on this basic gen of handsets.", "date": "Nov 18, 2004"}
