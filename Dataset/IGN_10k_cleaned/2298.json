It seems as though the developers of the game were in the dark bringing this nighttime racer to the handheld, as the idea is there...but the structure is not. Features Two cities More than forty cars to earn Password save Only for Game Boy Advance  In Midnight Club, you're out to race against a series of Midnight Club-ers, members of an elite group of racers who troll the streets at night looking for a challenge. By proving your worth to the gang members, he'll take you to the ~hidden~ spot where they set out to race. Win against his gang, and you'll earn the opportunity to race one-on-one against the leader for his car.  Now, obviously the good folks at Rebellion (the GBA version's developer) used the PlayStation 2 version as a blueprint for the portable game's design but the first thing that had to go was the original's 3D engine. The Game Boy Advance honestly doesn't have the horsepower, and a 2D engine is a lot more efficient. A harsh overhead perspective was chosen, and while it makes the game look strikingly similar to Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2, this camera location at least fits the GBA's system capablities. Technically the developers created a well-crafted engine that puts the system's sprite hardware abilities to use; the screen scrolls incredibly fast, car sprites rotate with a smooth turning motion, and each vehicle projects a transparent light onto the road using the GBA's alpha channel effects. And the traffic driving through the streets actually obey the continuously changing signals. It's unfortunate that the game designers didn't tweak the PS2 game layout to work with this game engine.  When you finally track down a gang of racers, it's a race to the designated finish line -- each gang has its own path through the city marked off by sporadic checkpoint flags throughout the city streets...not only do you have to hit every single one of these flags, you also have to come in first in order to move on in the game. On the PS2, it was great fun trying to find shortcuts through the city streets to tag the checkpoints and win the race. Here, if you deviate from the path set forth by the computer AI, you'll never win. And the big problem: YOU HAVE NO CLUE WHERE THE TRACK'S GOING. Yes, it's that big of a deal, since you're literally forced to trail behind the computer opponents and lose the race just so you can see where the heck the track goes. And don't give me that ~use the green arrow~ crud, because that green arrow points to the location of the closest checkpoint...not the checkpoint that's next in line to tag. So, if you follow where the green arrow's pointing, you'll have to backtrack to hit the checkpoints you missed along the way...and you'll lose the race 100% of the time doing so. Forced trial-and-error game design is absolutely irritating...what the developer should have done was to lay out the race path on the pavement for the current challenge so that folks know where to go. Racing games shouldn't make the player guess where to turn...and there is a LOT of guess work in this version of Midnight Club.  Worse, the computer AI is extremely basic --  every single car in the race follows a set path. So while they may be scattered at the start of a challenge, as soon as the light turns green they'll all converge into a single line. It's almost humorous to watch all five computer opponents snake around the corners as a train of cars. Oh, you can push through the link, but once the chain's been broken, they'll go right back to the same single file line if traffic permits. And cop cars are thrown all over the city to make racing a bit more hectic, but they'll single your car out of the entire pack of cars...realistically these guys should be going after the easiest target, but they'll zero in on you, even if you're surrounded on all sides by vehicles.  The single player game, with all of its design flaws and poor computer AI, can only go so far. The PlayStation 2 game had an absolutely fun split-screen mode for two players to race through the city. But that didn't get translated to handheld form at all -- multiplayer could have saved the game from the pit of mediocrity, but for whatever reason Rebellion didn't implement link cable in the Game Boy Advance version of Midnight Club. A real, unfortunate shame.  And finally, two words: Password Save. This game emphasizes car collection, as there's more than forty to unlock in the game through all the races in both cities. But they're not saved to cartridge as you earn them -- instead, you earn a password after every race won. But for some odd reason, you're not awarded a password for when you win a car off the one-on-one races. And if you forget to write down your password, it never shows up anywhere else in the game. Absolutely irritating, guys...as much as password save is disliked on the Game Boy Advance, why couldn't you have at least put a ~last password earned~ text string in the pause menu?   Midnight Club could have been a good Game Boy Advance game, but this title is chock full of so many obviously annoying elements that it's amazing that the developers slipped them through anyway. Just a few plays through the game and anyone can come up with a list of items that could have made the GBA edition a much more enjoyable racing title.", "date": "Nov 21, 2001"}
