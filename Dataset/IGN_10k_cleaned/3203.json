{"name": "Treasure Planet", "name_review": "Treasure Planet Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/14/treasure-planet-review", "text": ", the SCEA-published adaptation of the upcoming Disney film, is almost exactly what you would expect from a game of this sort.  Well, perhaps it's a little more than you'd expect, considering that the abominable Monsters Inc. set the standard in this particular slice of the PS2 software library, but then ~better than Monsters Inc.~ is the rough equivalent of ~better than Ishtar.~  Treasure Planet, then, is better than both Monsters Inc. and Ishtar.  It is not, however, better than a genuinely good platform adventure, a genre in which the PS2 is experiencing something of an embarassment of riches.  Treasure Planet occupies a rung roughly halfway between the rarefied heights of Sly Cooper and the Stygian pits wherein Monsters Inc. is hopefully tortured for all eternity.  While it could be worse, it is not good enough to be worth climbing down for a closer look.  Gameplay Two different types of levels make up Treasure Planet's circuit through the galaxy.  There are basic platforming levels, which feel a bit like Jaz & Daxter, and levels built around the ~Solar Surfer,~ which feel like the worst imitation of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater ever made.    The platforming bits, of course, are the best part, relatively speaking.  Our hero can hop and spin with the same aplomb as Naughty Dog's creations, and there's an assortment of fun gadgets used to solve puzzles -- a jetpack to fly for a brief time, cyborg arms to smash things or heft heavy objects.  Their chief affliction is a bad case of whatever disease also afflicts most Rare games, that strange compulsion to make the player collect things instead of presenting a genuinely engaging challenge.  The game's cast seems to think it terribly important to collect 100 coins and 10 bits of green energy in every level, but I frankly don't give a damn.  Thankfully, the majority of the tasks in the later levels are more complex than just ~get umpteen of these,~  The Solar Surfer bits, which looked like a good time when demo'd in limited form at E3, are pretty awful in their finished form.  The first Surfer level almost works, because it presents a linear circuit, rather than attempting to design an effective non-linear level.  The holes in the concept start showing at the end of that one, though, when you have to go through an entire lap around the level to try and take a jump just right to grab that very last coin.  Then, it all falls down.  The non-linear, Tony Hawk-style Surfer levels have terribly limited challenges, dead simple rail-riding mechanics (just press L1 and forward), glitchy collision detection, and inconsistent controls.  On top of that, the same case of Rare-itis afflicts these levels as well, with the addition of more imprecise controls when you're trying to grab that one chunk of green energy.      There is the occasional fun bit of platforming in this game, and when the Solar Surfer portion of the game does what it should have done -- be a racing game with a touch of platforming, a la NiGHTS -- it works well enough.  For the vast majority of the time, though, Treasure Planet reaches well beyond its capacity, and falls on its face in ugly fashion.  Graphics This is certainly a decent advertisement for the movie itself, since the design elements it borrows from Disney's production are very good.  The characters are very original, mechanical widgets like the Solar Surfer feature smart hybrid concepts, and the general blend of science fiction and 19th-century England is quite inventive.  But eventually the game's engine has to carry its share of the weight, and Treasure Planet has technical failings that design can't make up for.  Usually, Disney films are a bit more colorful than this.  Treasure Planet has a distinctly brownish palette, though, with textures that repeat themselves fairly often.  It also doesn't project the same sense of a unified world as Jak & Daxter, which it seems to be trying to resemble with regard to its animation design.  There's a clear demarcation between the accessible level and the background elements far beyond it, and generally a very linear character to platforming-oriented levels -- the first task is here, the next task is shortly after it, and so on.    Everything is noticeably aliased, characters and backgrounds alike.  Other glitches include invisible barriers that enforce a certain path of level progression -- there are spots where it looks like you could fly up to a certain point with the jet pack, but since the game didn't intend for you to cut that corner, it won't let you.  There's also some strange spots of draw-in, not affecting background architecture, but instead causing objects in the environment, like rocks or weeds sprouting out of the ground, to pop in and out of existence.  It's strange that the game would have such errors, because while the framerate is constant, it's never drawing anything exceptionally taxing.  Sound When it's borrowing music and effects from the movie, Treasure Planet sounds pretty good, and the voice acting in the animated cutscenes is naturally excellent, but the quality takes a bit of a dip when the game switches over to original creations.  The effects are limited by the lack of original enemies -- since most of the bad guys are the same, they all make the same basic boinkety and grunty noises -- and outside the cutscenes, the characters say hardly anything at all.  Jim Hawkins, the hero, seems limited to a single vocalization, an obnoxiously loud whoop triggered by the completion of a level goal.Treasure Planet hearkens back to the bygone age of movie-licensed games, back when all of them were published by Ocean and they all played more or less the same.  The difference now is that they're boring 3D platformers, rather than boring side-scrollers and/or boring top-down shooters.  Back then, there was no reason to buy a movie-licensed game when you could play something like Mario or Gunstar Heroes.  Now, there is no reason to buy Treasure Planet when you can play something like Ratchet & Clank or Sly Cooper.  As the saying goes, the more things change, the more they stay the same.", "date": "Nov 14, 2002"}
