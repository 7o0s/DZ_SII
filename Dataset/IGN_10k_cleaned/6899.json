It provided players with a unique gaming experience and it was a nice break from the 'shoot-everything-that-moves' type.  Well, the bug-eyed, stitch-faced Mudokon returns in Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus and you can expect more of the same fantastic gameplay in this one that you got in the original.  Abe's Exoddus takes off where Abe's Oddysee ended.  After saving his fellow Mudokons from RuptureFarms and returning home, Abe the fearless floor-waxer learns of another vile plot to exploit his brethren.  It seems that the Glukkons have captured even more Mudokons to work in their mines and factories producing SoulStorm Brew.  To make matters worse, the Glukkons are not only forcing live Mudokons to labor away in the mines, they're also disturbing the spirits of dead Mudokons.  In Exoddus' opening video sequence, Abe is confronted by three Mudokan spirits which fill him in on the whole nasty plot.  You see, SoulStorm Brew is made from Mudokon tears and ground Mudokon bones, so Abe feels kind of obligated to embark on a new quest and save his comrades.  Given the gravity of the situation, there's noting for Abe to do but set out across the desert to find the Glukkon brewery and free his friends.  Gameplay in Abe's Exoddus is similar to Abe's Oddysee, and the game even uses the same engine with a few improvements and tweaks.  Action takes place from a side-view and anyone familiar with Oddysee will be able to jump right into this one without even having to look over the manual. Actually, even new players will be able to jump into this one as the designers have incorporated a tutorial into the first level of Exoddus  la Oddysee.  In all, there are a total eight levels and 300 Mudokons to rescue, so this game is a bit larger than the original where there were only 99 Mudokons to save.   For those of you not familiar with the series, your goal is to free enslaved Mudokons and send them back home.  How do you accomplish this?  Well, Abe can speak to his brethren and tell them what to do to avoid being shot by Sligs, ground into paste by spinning machine parts, or falling off the side of a cliff.  By giving his chums voice commands such as ~follow me,' 'stop' or 'work,' Abe can use the other Mudokans to manipulate the game environment while keeping them safe.  Of course, it's not as easy as it sounds as there are a number of environmental hazards and baddies with guns to avoid before Abe can lead the Mudokons through mystical bird portals and teleport them to safety.  Although Abe has only a limited range of weapons to choose from (basically Abe comes across the occasional rock or grenade), he can use his chant power to control enemy beings.  This is a handy technique, but also a dangerous one as it takes a while to work and Abe must be in a safe area or he will likely be killed before he can take control of another being.    Abe's Exoddus features a colorful new cast of characters, as well as a few old hands.  The main character is, of course, Abe.  The lovable, loin-clothed Mudokon who's also the chosen savior of his race.  Most of the enemies from the original (like the Sligs, Scrabs, and Paramites) are back in Exoddus,  but you'll also run across a few new characters in some of the stages.  For example, you'll meet Vice-President Aslik (that's right kids, Aslik) in the FeeCo Depot stage and Director Phleg at the Bonewerks Brewery, who are two of the Glukkon masterminds behind the Mudokon enslavment.  But perhaps my favorite new enemies in Exoddus are the Greeters.  These evil PR robots look like aluminum trashcans on wheels and have huge smiles plastered on their metallic faces.  They look goofy enough, but they sure are deadly.  Some of the new features you'll find in Abe's latest adventure are the addition of invisibility and cure power-ups that Abe can use to sneak past creatures and heal his brothers respectively.  Abe can now possess his own farts and use them to destroy Chant Negators which zap Abe if he tries to chant while near them.  Oddworld Inhabitants has also given the captured Mudokons different emotions depending on their situation ... everything from being depressed to being totally strung-out on laughing gas (ok, so it's not really an emotion).  Abe will have to react to these Mudokans differently to get them to follow his commands.  For instance, you'll have to sooth angry Mudokons before they'll follow you and smack the hopped-up Mudokons upside the head to get them to listen.  Abe's Exoddus has everything to keep gamers entertained: an interesting story, great gameplay, nice graphics, and intelligent level design.  It's a bit more difficult than it's predecessor, but unlike the original you can save wherever you wish, making death in Exoddus not nearly as frustrating as it was in Oddysee.  By adding new features to an already stable backbone, Oddworld Inhabitants should have another hit on their hands.  -- Tal Blevins Abe's Exoddus is a game that delivers a strange standard in gameplaying. It takes the platform character paradigm and lifts it into a bizarre land of its own, complete with a unique communication scheme, an oftentimes annoying trial-and-error system, and a troupe of grotesquely cute and endearing characters. But what makes the game any better than Heart of Darkness or Dragon's Lair? Amazingly enough, it's the devilishly lovable characters who can talk to each other in many more ways than before. In an ass-backward kind of way, the game is tremendously rewarding, too. You'll have to repeat the same steps over and over again to get from point A to point B that will make you feverishly happy just to complete a small section. I was awfully frustrated with Abe's at first. But as I got to grips with the many audible commands, I really started falling in love. As much as goofing around with characters is a pleasure, however, I have to say the gameplay doesn't vary much more than the first game, and the same trial-and-error scheme is frustrating as a thorn in your heel. Several areas simply leave you stranded and you must start over again, a sign of poor design. So yeah, you are forced to get good  the object, anyway  but along the journey, it's more than just frustrating, it's agonizing. Some times, you'll simply want to quit altogether. Another bad sign. Nonetheless, like the character-rich Monster Rancher and the deep AI of PC game Creatures 2, the world of Abe is so gorgeously created and easy to dive into and the creatures so lovable, you will find Exoddus difficult to put down because of its charm. In the end, Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus is not just a cult game, it's bigger and better than that. But many people will be turned off with the die-until-you-don't game design and its unforgiving approach. Hopefully, the goofy ways of the hilarious Mudokons and their story will compel you to play on until the very end. But if you're not immediately swept away with Abe's Exoddus, then just don't buy this game. While it's not for everyone, those who favor it, will love it to death.", "date": "Jan 30, 1999"}
