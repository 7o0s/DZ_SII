In Ghost Squad, you will. It's that kind of game  a bombastic celebration of shooting stuff; an orgy of silliness and hoo-hah, wrapped in scenarios and settings that make for some very entertaining light-gun-style shooting action. For those new to the Ghost Squad license, Sega has lifted the 2004 arcade release and brought it onto the Wii entirely intact, with a few requisite extras and Wii control refinements.   As part of the G.H.O.S.T. (cue: wacky acronym  Global Humanitarian Operation and Special Tactics) Squad, you're tasked with righting the world's wrongs in a discrete and professional manner. At least, that's what they tell you during the opening briefing, before it all flies out the window as you open fire with your unsilenced, standard issue Level 1 machine gun. So much for the element of surprise, eh lads?   The three locations are varied and interesting to travel through  the first is a luxurious villa; its rooms are filled with destructible objects like glass tables, baskets of fruit and most other inanimate paraphernalia. The Wii does a good job of keeping up with the explosive details, but the textures are definitely lacking. It looks like a game that's now technically entering its fourth year of shelf life.      The next two levels are more impressive  the second destination is aboard Air Force One (featuring the hip-hop and happening Prez who's into dishing out high-fives). This area, being entirely self-contained, feels like the shortest of the three levels, but the multiple routes can either take you directly to the captive president or all the way throughout the hull and storage areas of the plane. Of course, this begs the question of if it's really such a good idea to be firing guns inside the pressurised cabin of a plane, but we'll let Sega slide on this one.   Visually, there's still not a heck of a lot to write home about; the level of interactivity still sits on par with the other two. What makes it more interesting is just how strange and quick-paced the action is. One moment, you're saving the pilots in the cockpit, before you're down in the storage bay in the middle of wild turbulence the next. The crates slide around, the camera's POV is shifting to compensate and things are exploding all over the place. By the end, as the suspiciously well-coiffed ringleader is about to make his getaway with the Commander-in-Chief in a mini-jet (where do they get the funding for this stuff? Seriously.), the game breaks away into one of several critical-moments. You're asked to make a single headshot kill, which knocks the terrorist leader out of the back of the plane where he explodes. Ho ho.   The third and final level is probably the most visually impressive and expansive, taking you though jungle settlements of huts and bridged walkways. Again, you can periodically choose which direction or task you want to tackle  be it saving hostages, clearing huts and so on. Eventually you make your way onto the wild rapids in a boat where you have your final confrontation for the game.    The weekend retreat in the mountains started off nicely enough, but the terrorist uprising really put a dampener on the festivities.  The game's structure is such that all three of the main arcade scenarios can be run through in about ten minutes each; roughly 30 minutes of gameplay by following one route through the on-rails levels. The real replayability comes in the form of on-the-spot decisions that must be made. These vary from overt action (kill the terrorists in the left room, or head down the hall) to slower-paced puzzles such a bomb disarming, or saving hostages. Other times, you'll have to change up your weapon for a sniper rifle for a bit of Silent-Scope-esque action. Sega's AM2 has gone the extra mile to mix things up enough for seasoned shooter fans  the addition of pseudo-hand-to-hand is kind of silly, but like active time events in other games, it breaks up the monotony of the shooting.   Training mode, a feature exclusive to the Wii version, is designed to hone your skills for the main and party modes. In it, you have your standard shoot-the-targets modes and a slightly more interesting 'combat training' mode, featuring a series of increasingly complex scenarios that you need to solve with lead and brute force. In truth, this whole Training section feels a lot more like added-value gaming  it doesn't really make you a better player as such; it just gives you a few more challenges to master and extends the life of the game. The addition of four players in the target-shooting mode is a nice touch. The other multiplayer mode is Party Mode  a competitive set-up for between two and four players, using weapons unlocked in the single-player arcade mode (there are 25 different weapons to unlock).   There's a pleasing amount of variety for an on-rails shooter.  The acting is laughably awful  the cornball dialogue, tips from your commander and insolent quips from nefarious henchmen with bad facial hair are so bad that it's gone all the way back around to being good again. I guess the developer figured that it couldn't get quality actors, so it might as well get the talent to ham it up instead. We're not sure if we applaud the decision, but unintentional hilarity is hilarity just the same. The music fares a little better  drumroll militaria, electronic synth-rock. Not amazing, but tolerable.   The Wii's online capabilities are shamefully wasted too, given that it wouldn't be to hard to synch up multiple cursors over the top of the engine (presumably). Instead, you can submit and keep track of global and regional score tables.   Its hard to put a finger on where Ghost Squad falls down; theres this overriding feeling of budget development. Its not consistent in its presentation  textures are PS2-era in quality, animations are decent, but models clip through objects, walls and each other with no physics or collision detection. Its not so much that this is a rush-job port, but a version of a game that perhaps sits too closely to the original. For the Wii-owning on-rails shooter fan, its definitely worth picking up, but for people looking for a gameplay revelation, this isnt it.", "date": "Jan 24, 2008"}
