Brash, hard hitting and high scoring, the title was a decent presentation of the mayhem that happens between the dasher boards of any AFL league game, but was rather sparse on content.  Well, it's a year later, and players that enjoyed the previous title are looking forward to jumping into this year's game, Arena Football: Road to Glory, and leading their teams to the ArenaBowl.  Unfortunately, with only some roster additions and a few minor tweaks made to the game, this is essentially the same title as last year.   Just like its predecessor, Road to Glory does a good job of explaining the arcane rules and subtle adjustments to the sport of arena football.  The game is 8-on-8 between the hash marks and features ~Ironman~ style of play, where most of the men on the field play offense and defense. For football fans coming from the long established guidelines of the NFL, it may take a little while to wrap your head around the various restrictions or changes within Arena football; fortunately the game provides numerous tutorials both as a feature and constantly on a loop whenever you hit pause during a game. It'll probably take a couple of matches before you'll get the hang of not twisting on the line, or keeping your Jack linebacker inside the box without illegal motion, but it'll quickly come to you.   Welcome to Arena Football, once again. What won't come easily is gaining yards via the ground game.  Thanks to the various limitations of linebackers blitzing around specific holes in the line or running plays that are easily telegraphed and sniffed out by defenders, you're probably going to be lucky to gain a few extremely hard-fought feet in short yardage situations.  As a result, you'll wind up relying a lot more upon the passing game than any other football game you've ever played.  In fact, the same deep crossing routes, post and fly routes from last year's game will still wind up being just as deadly in Road to Glory.  While you can swarm a team's most thrown to receiver with your defensive backs, it's easy for an astute quarterback to set up a defense with one receiver and quickly pick them apart with ball distribution to the uncovered receivers.   Attempting to add a little depth to the unbalanced offensive aerial assault is the option to control both your quarterback and a receiver at the same time.  Before the ball is snapped, you select the receiver you want to play and then hike the ball.  By using the right analog stick, you can control the quarterback while at the same time running your route with the left analog stick.  This is designed to give you a lot more control over your entire offense, but there are some serious problems with the concept.  Part of it has to do with the fact that trying to maneuver your quarterback at the same time you're trying to slice your way through a defense can be mentally taxing to pull off, even with multiple hours of practice and games under your belt.  The other part has to do with the fact that you don't seem to have as much accuracy when you're using both analog sticks, making it hard to place the ball exactly where you want it to go without accidentally throwing it away.   Hard hits are still in, deep gameplay is still left out. Defense hasn't really been changed that much in Road to Glory.  Players still have the ability to land frightening, bone crunching hits on players, spinning them around like tops in mid-air or smashing them into walls.  While it's still a little confusing where the line of a clean hit and unsportsmanlike conduct can be on what appears to be a legitimate tackle, the defense can bring the pain when they need to.  Unfortunately, you'll probably notice when you're on defense some of the technical problems, such as slowdown that will crop up whenever you and your fellow defenders converge on a ball carrier, as well as coaches on the field that sometimes hinder the ability to grab fumbles. The biggest problem with this fumble issue is that they appear when you least expect them to, turning into impromptu blockers that interfere with the action on the field.    The minor and overshadowed offensive feature ties into the light improvements that have been made to Road to Glory.  Last year's game was incredibly bare boned, with practically nothing included in the game.  This year definitely has more features in all, but they're so limited and unimpressive that they might as well not be included in the title.  For instance, players have the ability to create rosters, teams and players, but these are classic sports games features that have existed for years now.  As a quick diversionary feature, players can test their skills at splitting the uprights with the field goal challenge.  While it's a decent way for you and other players to check your skills with the analog stick kicking mechanic, it quickly becomes dull and repetitive.   Hey look, you got your Blitz in my Arena Football game! Obviously, for a football title, season play is supposed to be a large highlight for the title.  However, instead of providing training regiments, franchise management or team information, the sole improvement made in this year's game is the inclusion of the AF2 league. While that may be appealing to hardcore arena football league fans, most of the teams included in the game are so obscure, you're not going to care that you unlock or have the opportunity to play as a team from football powerhouse towns like Tennessee Valley or Manchester.  Considering that you have the opportunity to unlock a number of these teams via the challenge mode, you're not necessarily gaining anything impressive. In fact, the largest thing you can do with these teams is export their roster lists at the end of a season, adding to the pool of potential free agents that your team can sign.  That may be interesting for a while, but if you're looking for deep seasonal play, you're not going to find anything resembling that in this game.    Nor are you going to experience any new visuals in Road to Glory that weren't included in last year's game.  In fact, just about everything, from the cutscenes to the character models have been recycled for the game; unfortunately, that also includes the various clipping issues and visual hiccups that will pop up during matches.  You will notice players fading through dasher boards as they go for a pass in the end zone and run through the wall around the field. Cutscenes still feel like a less dynamic, profanity free scene on the cutting room floor of Blitz, albeit with worse camera work framing the athletes.  The crowd still looks hideous, with a faded texture bathed in stadium light, which is a definite downside to playing a sport that places the audience so close to the field.   Easily one of the blandest runbacks in sports history, thanks to the missing play by play. Sound isn't so great either.  There still is no color commentary or play by play for the game, and instead, the same bland P.A. announcer from last year pops up to announce yardage or calls.  This is lame for a sport that's supposed to be exciting, and particularly disappointing considering EA's deal with ESPN for content.  Couldn't you put Mike Golic and Mike Greenberg in the booth?  At least they've covered the sport for their channel. Every now and then, the announcer will also make strange calls, like simply referring to an arena as Home Stadium in the intro sequence. Most of the player dialogue feels canned and unimpressive, the crowd excitement level still feels too low and the rock soundtrack is fine, but not particularly exciting.  Road to Glory is more like a Path to Repetition.  The most important omission is perhaps the rejection of this season's Elway Rule, which would do away with the Ironman football and allow for substitution at any point in the game.  But rules aside, it's apparent when you pick up this game that there hasn't really been a lot done to change it from last year's title.  The same visual bugs are there, the same bland sound is there, and even with the addition of AF2 teams, you're still getting an extremely shallow football experience. No true team management, no significant new features, and no major additions to the game make this feel like a barely expanded title.", "date": "Mar 14, 2007"}
