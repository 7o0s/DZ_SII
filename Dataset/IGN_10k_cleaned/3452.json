Big not only in name, the plot-heavy epic is also massive in terms of scope, characterization, and focused ambition. Developed by Monolith Software (the same team that assembled the controversial 1998 RPG Xenogears; the universe of which this newest game is loosely based), Xenosaga is an epic six-part story that's rumored to span three different consoles and almost a decade of time before it finally reaches a conclusion. And while there are still no guarantees made as to whether or not that forecast will hold true, the idea of it all still remains undeniably impressive.   Alas there's still plenty of time to pass before we even begin to approach those later games in the series; and for now all that we have in front of us is this inaugural episode. But to trivialize the beginning of a massive RPG serial like this really isn't warranted. As unlike a similarly multi-part collection started earlier this month (Bandai's .hack), Xenosaga is as much a stand alone piece as it is the sum of a much greater scheme. The first step in establishing 15,000 years of conflict and mystery, Der Wille zur Macht has connotations every bit as stimulating as the Nietzsche-philosophy that it's based on. Thought provoking and borderline controversial, Xenosaga is a great many things to be sure; but what it is above all else, is undeniably good.   Story  To speak too liberally of Xenosaga's plot would do a great injustice to anyone who wants to experience it. But for the sake of being thorough and informative, the basic idea is along the lines of this: Six thousand years into the future (aka T.C. 4767) humankind has abandoned their home and left the Earth for dead. Having unlocked the secrets to space travel, the Terrans have taken to the universe in order to feed their thirst for knowledge and become a society of science and advancement. Its latest mystery is a powerful ancient artifact known only as the Zohar. Supposedly in existence since the dawn of time itself, the Zohar represents a great many things to a great many people and could hold the key of all existence somewhere within its confines.    Unfortunately the human race is also at war. Attacked whenever exploring Zohar-related space, the phantom-like alien species called the Gnosis has begun slaughtering Earthlings by the millions. Blessed with the ability to transcend multiple dimensions, the Gnosis has the uncanny ability to crystallize the bodies of its human victims in our reality while remaining virtually untouchable in theirs. Mankind needs a method by which to stop the menace before it destroys everyone and everything, and so that the mysteries of the Zohar can finally be solved.   That's where the player comes in. Assuming the role of Vector Industries' Science Chief Shion Uzuki, the game truly kicks off as her team puts the finishing touches on an ultimate android weapon known as KOS-MOS. Built specifically to battle the Gnosis and bodyguard the Zohar, KOS-MOS could be mankind's last and only hope. The storyline doesn't stay simple for long though, as in only a matter of hours, new players, characters, sub-plots, and the involvement a rogue group of terrorists known as U-TIC bleeds into the machination with motion picture-like zest. Calling the game ~Epic~ would be an understatement, though completionists may be disappointed to learn that several of the underlying subplots go unanswered until the next episode.    Veteran RPG gamers may find some of the information listed above a little similar to Monolith's other big project Xenogears. Originally published by Square for the PlayStation One, Xenogears was to be the fifth installment of a separate but similar six-part series. In fact, Monolith and the game honcho Tetsuya Takahashi even went so far as to create a tome of knowledge detailing these events in Xenogears Perfect Works: The Real Thing. Flipping through its pages, you might even be amazed to discover that several of the events described within the book made it into this game as well, not to mention a few direct character references. The official word on the street, however, is that these two games are not linked at all -- and just happen to share universal traits much like SaGa and Final Fantasy do. We'll leave it to our readers to draw their own conclusions on that matter, but it won't take a rocket scientist to figure out the real story (re: the beauty of politics).   Characters  One of Xenosaga's strongest aspects is its admirable use of characterization. Quite possibly the most realistic portrayal of protagonists we've yet seen on the PlayStation 2, the cast of Der Wille zur Macht is a truly powerful lineup. Though it doesn't stand out for the typical reasons most games are usually noted for (killer costume design, Badass weaponry), the depth of each personality is so vast that it's akin to that found in modern literature.   Far from typical, no single character fits a particular mold. The game's hero, Shion Uzuki is more complicated than she first lets on. Though she's determined and optimistic, her past is clouded with several tragic events that have shaken her confidence and altered the way she interacts with male members of the species. KOS-MOS on the other hand, is an unstoppable weapon of war that knows full well she's practically invincible. As far from emotion as you could imagine, there's still a spark of humanity trying to break free from her mechanical confines -- or is there?   The other players are just as intriguing; a one hundred-year old cyborg named Ziggurat-8 struggles to forget about his human past in order to become nothing more than a pure machine, while the artificial being known as MOMO attempts to reconcile her engineered purpose and deal with the abandonment issues that have haunted her for ages. It is the relationship between these two completely different beings that truly defines one of Xenosaga's underlying themes -- similarity despite diversity. A father/daughter relationship if there ever was one, the Ziggy/MOMO dynamic is among the most sincere in all of videogame history.    And yet there are even more stars to be seen in Xenosaga's galaxy of participants. Serene and overly generous, the melancholic teenager named Chaos brings quite the mystical heir to the cast of characters. Possessing strange magical powers granted to him by an unknown source, the seraphim-themed traveler is an enigma that fits in well with the religious overtones that the game so eloquently exudes. Finally there's the eccentric ~Junior~. A director of the Kukai Foundation and one of the few humans in our gallery, Junior is the carefree decision maker of the group, who possess a lot more wisdom than you'd expect. Can a twelve year-old boy really be this complex?    There's more to Xenosaga's culture pot than the heroes we've listed above, though. Overflowing with supporting characters and villains (including an evil madman who matches tit-for-tat with the classic Final Fantasy VI dictator Kefka), there's never been a videogame that so faithfully captures the varying levels of personality. Motivated, manipulated, and restrained by a range of recurring themes and problems (the aforementioned similarities between different people, confronting the past, building a future, defining a sense of self, etc), finding another title in this or any other genre on any other system is nigh impossible.    Gameplay  As the previews, message boards, and import reviews have most certainly told you, a large part of Xenosaga apprehension centers on the fact that there isn't as much exploring as there is cinematic cut scenes (for more on that look below in the next section). And while it may appear at first that this is the case, the truth is that instances of gameplay outweigh the movies (with the longer nature of the cinematics, however, it's rather obvious as to how this can be misconstrued). Once that stigma is out of the way, however, open-minded gamers and RPG freaks will be happy to know that there's plenty to do; despite what you may have heard elsewhere.   Loosely based on the battle system that Monolith already established with Xenogears, Der Wille zur Macht has a complicated array of systems and sub-games that can best be described as advanced. Ditching the three-button light, medium, and heavy attacks of Gears, Xenosaga uses ranged attacks instead (short and far if you're curious). More progressive and customizable than before, this new system can be manipulated in a myriad of ways, and based on how your character is upgraded, can be changed to fit whatever play-style you prefer. This is done by forming combinations that you can assign via the Tech Attack menu, and by distributing bonus Tech Points that are earned with each successful victory. Though you can never learn new Tech Attacks just by assigning points (you'll need to climb in levels to do that), you can change the way that each attack is performed and how quickly you can pull it off. Once you've decided what kind of maneuvers you'll wield in battle, it's off to the fights you go.    Once battle begins character movement and attacks are dictated by what's known as Action Points or A.P. (of which there are four per character at the start of every round). Since every action costs a certain number of points, part of the strategy is figuring out how to best utilize your reserve in the most efficient manner while fending off the advances of your enemy. Usually you can pull off a two-hit combo with the four points given to you and in the early going that's all you'll really need. As the game advances though, and the enemies grow stronger in power your techniques will need to become more advanced as well. A good general strategy is to buffer your commands into the next round (which allows your unused points to carry over) and perform an even more powerful three-hit combination or what's known as an ~Ether~ attack for more damage (Ether is the game's equivalent of magic). Other strategies such as changing your position on the battlefield, using an item, or switching into an A.G.W.S. can be pulled of as well (more on those beasties later). The whole system works really well, and once you're over the small learning curve becomes nothing but second nature.    Random encounter haters should be pleased to know that Xenosaga reveals what enemies are on the screen so that they can be avoided or attacked (don't be fooled though, there are plenty of non-boss monsters you'll have to fight anyway). As an added bonus, several of your foes can be crippled moments before fight time as well. Walk up next to an exploding generator or flammable barrel and blast it before an enemy can touch you, and the explosion or residual energy alters the stats of your opponent before the beginning of the melee. Whether it's an offensive or defensive rating that is lowered, or a completely filled boost meter (a gradually-filling gauge that allows players to steal turns from their enemies), the rewards are always positive and adds an extra bit of strategy to the battlefield.   There are other techniques than can improve your battle weariness as well, such as the ability to learn new inherent skills by extracting them from accessories or evolving existing Ether techniques into more powerful shades of themselves. Built like a branching tree with more effective leaves as you go along, the Ether Evolution system is an imaginative take on the usual magical upgrade system. Regardless of what it is you want to upgrade separate from the usual experience point level gains, your characters are customizable in just about every category. Including their attributes that can be upgraded independently of level gains. All you need to do is earn the proper point type to improve them (done so by pulling off combinations, instant kills, and clever strategies in battle).   As we mentioned earlier, there's also a battle option that allows you to use what's known as an A.W.G.S. (pronounced ~eggs~). An homage to the previously released Xenogears, the ~Anti-Gnosis Weapons System~ is basically a giant whoop-ass robot. Smaller in scale and less effective than the Gears found in our favorite 1998 PlayStation One RPG, the A.G.W.S. are more of a novelty than a necessity (though there are few sections where they'll come in handy). Completely upgradeable and powerful, these suckers are expensive to maintain and offer little in terms of spectacular attacks (but they're fun to upgrade and a quick way to protect your defensively weaker characters). Sadly, it's entirely possible to play through the game without ever needing to pilot your robot even once. And that says a lot about the A.G.W.S' novelty value, considering the above-average difficulty setting of Xenosaga.    A segment of the game that hasn't been discussed much is what's known as the Unus Mundus Network. Sort of a PDA with super abilities, the U.M.S. is a nifty little feature that provides many of the game's sidequests, mini-games, and informational tools. Setup with an email system that allows players to read about new story points and take part in several side missions, it's a more interactive approach to a similar bonus supplied in the Bandai RPG .hack. Downloading attachments or replying to certain messages can often make a big difference in the status and equipment of your character, and there are several secret emails that are sent based on your actions and locations from previous events. Good luck finding those.    Additional options to be found in the U.M.S. include a handy Plug-In Module browser that allows you to view which attachments you've added to your PDA and a database that includes info and three-dimensional models of the Gnosis you've battled. You can even look up certain keywords that have been used throughout the game and learn more about the Acronyms, characters, places, and phrases that you've heard on your journey. Finally, there's a much-needed Environmental Simulator (E.V.S) that recreates all the areas you've already been to. Perfect for locating items you may have missed or to build your characters abilities to higher levels.   Finally we have the mini-games. Earned by finding passports in various locations, the mini-games range from excellent to dreadful. The A.G.W.S. segment for instance has absolutely no comfortable control scheme whatsoever, and is a relatively poor but simple version of the Sega classic Virtua On (don't worry, this is a separate control scheme from the A.G.W.S. manipulation found in regular battle). On the flipside, you have the excellent Xenocards game that emulates Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh to a tee. The only way to earn certain items and goodies, the addictive card battle is a great way to tack on extra hours to your already inflated time count and more realistically approach the supposed 80 hours of play time. Remaining games like the Casino and Drilling gig are interesting too, but no where near as cool as our beloved playing cards.   Cinematics  If there's a single deterrent that works against Xenosaga Episode I above all else, it could be the frequency and length of all the game's cinematics. A necessary tool when telling a tale as massive as this, the sheer onslaught of it all could be too much for gamers that just want to run around and gain experience. Officially clocked at 30 hours for the cinema-only portions (according to the representatives from Namco that we spoke to moments before the penning of this review -- though we think it's more like 15), there's a whole lot of inactivity that you can bank on.    That's not to say that the cinemas themselves aren't marvelous examples of cinematic direction. On par with Hollywood's big budget summer blockbusters, Der Wille zur Macht has spectacular space battles and one-on-one duels that rival even the most popular of Star Wars films. The angles and editing are top-notch and even when the scenes shift to mere dialogue between characters, it's as believable then as it is during firefights.   Unfortunately the pacing of the game starts off quite slowly, and there are instances later on the in the journey that can last as long as fifty minutes per scene. Thankfully, the developers have included the option to pause the cinemas at any point, save your game, or skip them altogether (which comes in handy for the instances that force you to watch a cinema and confront a tough boss afterwards). As we said earlier, though, the frequency at which these scenes appear could become too much for the average gamer to stomach. And the decision to not include a replay feature of the cinemas you've already watched was a poor one. Ultimately, the general reaction to these movies is what will probably make or break Xenosaga's success.    Graphics  Originally released in Japan a year ago this month, Xenosaga is the unfortunate victim of its age. Much in the way that Dragon Warrior VII was dated by the time it hit shelves for the PlayStation One a few years back, the long development time for Monolith's masterpiece has definitely worked against it. Awkward and filled with aliasing problems, the polygonal models of every character is obviously far behind the top-notch work found in more recent offerings like Dark Cloud 2 or Final Fantasy X.   To its credit though, Xenosaga is overflowing with color and imaginative design. Despite a somewhat limited setting (outer space and the interior of star vessels mostly), the developers have still managed to get away with flooding the senses with a myriad of multi-hued shades. Whether it's the frenetic Hyperspace battle between the U-TIC and the Elsa or the gritty rescue on Asteroid Pleroma, the range of color here is astounding. And with special effects at every turn and some pretty spectacular space opera designs, it's easy to overlook the poorly executed models.   What stands out most in the visuals department, however, is the flawless recreation of facial expression and emotion. Not quite detailed to the realistic point of most of today's graphical powerhouses, Xenosaga takes its basic low-texture faces and does things that deserve applause. If you forgive the fact that lip movements don't match the spoken words (Don't blame the translation folks, the Japanese version didn't match either) and follow these characters in their journey, you'll discover very quickly how little things can make a big difference.   Pauses in character blinking, shy glances, and sorrowful eyes are but a few of the types of expressions that Monolith has unwaveringly brought to the table. And though these faces look stupendous, it's the added body language and mannerisms of each character that serves as icing on the cake. Every player has a different stance, type of walk, and technique to how they interact with others and their environment. It may not be noticeable at first but as time goes on and you can study the characters more carefully, you'll soon realize just how close to breathing entities they are.    Sound  Xenosaga's epic soundtrack has been scored by none other than the legendary Yasunori Mitsuda. A legend throughout the world for his contributions to videogame music (re: Chrono Trigger, Xenogears, Chrono Cross, Shadow Hearts, etc) Mitsuda is among the premiere artists in his field. For those of you who follow his work you won't be disappointed here either, as this is one of his best collections to date. The heavily orchestral composition (brought to life on several occasions by the London Philharmonic) is near genius with nearly every passing track, and though one or two stinkers may exist somewhere in the mix (the selection known as ~pain~ immediately springs to mind -- and is fittingly titled to boot), the score on the whole is brilliant.    Take for instance the haunting re-imagining of Ralph Vaughan Williams' classic Christmas tune Greensleeves. Brought down a few octaves and played slightly slower tempo, the usually relaxing wintertime song is transformed into an almost terrifying opus of fear and discomfort. Still beautiful for entirely different reasons, it's this manipulation of the notes that Mitsuda is known best for. Of course, his work created specifically for the game is what really stands out (Gnosis and Albeto's Theme are extremely good) with no limit to the range of emotions that Mitsuda hits with near marksman-like accuracy. Pick the soundtrack up as an extra if you can find it import stores; it's most definitely worth it.   As amazing as the score may be, Xenosaga has a unique problem attributed to it: the music during gameplay is practically non-existent. Instead of playing the various tunes at multiple points throughout your adventure, Mitsuda's hard work is limited almost exclusively to cut scenes. And other than a few select rooms (that's right. Rooms. Not places) and enemy-laden corridors, that's the way it stays until the spectacular end. Structured like that of a motion picture, most of the traveling in Xenosaga is highlighted only by the ambient sounds of machinery, generators, and other flotsam. An artistic choice to be sure, it's a decision that ultimately hurts because of the overwhelming quality of the soundtrack. Less ambiance and more medleys would have been perfect.   On the vocal front Xenosaga doesn't score nearly as well. Best compared to an average American dub of an edited Japanese anime, the actors have their ups and downs just as you'd expect. The lead character Shion is surprisingly strong, though, and since she's the voice you'll hear most often the experience is more positive than negative. KOS-MOS too, captures the proper heir with her Lieutenant Data-like mannerisms and small lists of supporting characters do their agents justice with their performances. Other players, however, like the booty-shorts wearing enigma known as Chaos and his mysterious little buddy Junior are in dire need of adjustment. Overacting is our word of the day.So what does it all mean? Equipped with one of the zestier battle systems this side of Xenogears and stuffed with character development the likes of which we've never seen, you'd think that picking this one up would be a no brainer. And for hardcore RPG fans out there it will be. But for more casual followers of the Role-Playing genre and everyday gamers looking for a thrill, Xenosaga Episode 1: Der Wille zur Macht could prove too intimidating (or too inactive) for their videogaming tastes (no matter how many pretty pictures Monolith throws their way)For those of us who like this sort of thing, however, Xenosaga is a deeply enriching thrill ride towards the cosmos. Realistically vanquished in 30-40 hours, this epic space opera is truthfully described as a member of the PlayStation 2's elite RPG club. Not without a few gameplay-to-cinema pacing problems, Der Wille zur Macht can still stand toe to toe with the best of them; and what's most exciting of all, is that it's only the beginning of something much larger to come.", "date": "Feb 24, 2003"}
