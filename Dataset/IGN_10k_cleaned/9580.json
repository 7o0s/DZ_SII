This is the Queen; the leader of her species and the only survivor of a terrible cross-species conflict that left an entire race in tatters and cost the lives of millions. She pleads with you to spare her life - she knows her kind went down the wrong path and she wants to start again; all you need to do is release her and give her the benefit of the doubt. Or, you could ensure that her species is never given the chance to wage war again - it's a safer option, but killing her means final, damning extinction. What do you do?   This is the kind of moral dilemma that sits at the core of Mass Effect. BioWare, champions of the western RPG genre and veteran developer in its own right, has crafted a brilliant and profound storyline that justified the wait. Having moved away from the strict Dungeons and Dragons universe set up by Baldur's Gate, formed new fans with the Star Wars licence and progressively adopted a more accessible real-time action-oriented format for combat, Mass Effect really does feel like the culmination of years of ideas, carefully refined and tied to a story with depth and heart.   For those with no background on Mass Effect, we'll give you the brief you need. The title refers to 'mass effect' technology - basically a technique of using mass-manipulating alien jumpgates to travel through the universe, as well as for use in offensive and defensive tools. These jumpgates were originally of alien origin and found by the human race, midway through the 2100s. Now, in the year 2183, you adopt the role of Commander Shephard of the Systems Alliance Military - basically the galaxy-wide military regiment - and you're about to get dragged into a situation that will reset our understanding about the origins of life in the universe.      The key to all of this rests with two races - the Protheans, an ancient and infinitely technologically superior race that developed the jumpgates but mysteriously vanished, and another decidedly more evil and tangible race known as the Geth, a synthetic race that are a dominant threat for most of the game.    Of course, before you can start kicking all kinds of space-born synthetic butt, you need to create your ultimate Commander. The character creation process is pretty deep - up there with the facial complexity of The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, but limited to male and female humans only. Humanity and its place in the larger galaxy is actually a key theme throughout the story. Subplots and dialogue exchanges deal heavily with ideas of racism and prejudice, which really begins to make itself apparent when, early in the game, you're fortunate enough to be the first human inducted into the traditionally alien Spectres (elite military agents).   Class selection and background story choices come next - and these really do have a large impact on how you're going to spend the next 30 hours of your gaming life. Non-RPGers and shooter fans should probably opt for the Soldier, Vanguard or Infiltrator classes. These take advantage of your standard array of pistols, shotguns, assault and sniper rifles. Gameplay is still dominated by experience points, skill trees and clever use of basic biotic skills (which we'll delve into momentarily), but combat is all about behind-the-shoulder shooting, using cover and relying on customising your armour and weapons with upgradeable components, like shield boosters or soft-flesh mangling munitions if you're a Soldier-class.   An example of the galactic map at nebula level. Zoom in closer to go to the solar system level.  Since the Geth, a race of evil sentient robots, are synthetic and mechanical, the Tech class is actually pretty interesting. Outside of being able to access secure consoles and containers more easily than other classes, your abilities are geared towards shutting down and holding off as much as more offensive attacks. Classes include the Engineer, the Sentinel and the Infiltrator.   Things get more interesting and a little more traditional when using a biotic character. Biotics, the magic-like skill of taking advantage of mass effects that warp, suspend, throw and manipulate characters in the field, forces you to manage your casting times and take advantage of squad tactics a little more. These biotic options are ruled by the Adept and Sentinel classes. There are also blended classes, of which Vanguard is probably the most flexible for gamers who want a taste of both styles. This was our selection. Much later in the game, you can also unlock new specialisation classes too, giving you further reasons to replay the game.   There are a lot of moments in the game that provide you with chances to steer your character towards wholesome (the 'Paragon' path) or tainted (the 'Renegade' path). These choices, measured and awarded to you based on your decisions in conversation and mission objectives, affect how people treat you, what conversation options are at your disposal and even what direction the story eventually takes. It's all cleverly integrated into the story, too - particularly if you're pursuing a romantic subplot, as you'll see.    Mass Effect is as close to a squad-based shooter as the genre has ever neared. You can issue on-the-fly commands with the D-pad, use the radial menu systems (mapped to LB and RB) to bring up weapon and biotics selections, and take advantage of their limited AI to absorb bullets and biotic blasts while you tackle the situation from a different angle. It's limited but mostly effective. We say 'mostly' because the AI does, on occasion, screw up royally. Your opponents can sometimes get stuck inside objects, your teammates love to get themselves blown up by charging in to do battle - against a rocket turret and there are times when you'll hiss at the way some bullets clip through walls and crates, sapping your health while you try and take cover. Save often.   Largely though, the encounters with space pirates, mercenaries, sentient tentacled vegetation and waves of synthetic aliens remain pretty interesting - to the point where you forget that you're actually levelling up and each shot is technically based on a damage formula. This is a hardcore RPG in space-sheep's clothing - but it's missing some elements we're used to from past BioWare efforts. You cannot queue commands for your teammates to perform. This isn't a disaster, but it lessens the level of strategy. The AI generally knows when to activate a defensive biotic when a major fracas occurs, but it doesn't always use the most appropriate moments to use a biotic mass effect attack. This results in their death, since sometimes a shot with a sniper rifle from afar is more effective than rushing in and alerting all of the enemies.   A lot has been made (read: hyped) about Mass Effect's epic scope. Some of it is justified and some not so much; the Citadel space station is enormous, with a dozen sectors and a fast-travel transit system. Although you can join the plot-dots and play through the whole setting in a couple of hours, but sub quests, incidental encounters and exploration bump your time up significantly. The game widens its vista even further when you eventually gain control of the Normandy - your multi-levelled spacecraft.   Wrex, one of your allies. He's a bit of a jerk, but his lip-synching is awesome so we keep him around and don't rag on him too much.  All of this aside, there are elements of the game that don't quite feel as epic or interesting as they should be. Yes, there are a couple hundred planets in the game. No, you can't land on very many of them. To refine this point a little further, planets come in three flavours - a high-orbit view of the surface that gives brief and generally pretty entertaining information about the geological and environmental conditions of the planet; the second allows you to land on the planet and drive around in your heavily armed Mako all-terrain war machine; the third combines elements of vehicular travel with key cities, such as the ExeGeni corporation headquarters, various colonial settlements, abandoned Prothean dwellings and underground mining facilities. These planets absolutely dwarf any level in Knights of the Old Republic. They combine large sections of driving and shooting, Halo-like combat (replete with glowing blue shield generators and grunt equivalents) and sweeping stretches of highway, rocky trails and seaside ravines with well designed human settlements, industrial complexes and more.   When simply traversing the surface of an explorable planet, much of the experience is simply getting from point A to B. You're best off marking out the points of interest (mineral deposits, alien artefacts or bases and encampments) and using your rover to plough over terrain. The environments are very sparse - generally mountainous or stretches of flatland - but little else. Of course, there's a cheap thrill in finding our own solar system and then landing on the moon (referred to as 'Luna'), driving through a massive crater and retrieving data from a Russian probe, then taking out a training base that's been overrun by the enemy. The visual impact of driving under the looming presence of another planetary body can't be denied either. The art department really nailed the look of all the various atmospheres - swirling with snow, red with dust and reflected light, green and blue with moss and rock. They look fantastic, but we wish there was a little more to do on each.   Staggering artistry, but at a cost to performance. Still looks red-hot in still shots though.  Then again, a little exploration does raise some cool incidental moments. Space monkeys populate one planet. Sweet. Shooting one results in a brown splatter, while garnering a derisive response from your teammate. Elsewhere, giant gas bladders float around, waiting to be blown apart, wreckage of failed expeditions dot the worlds and just wait until you accidentally drive over a dormant underground Thresher Maw. Dear god.   BioWare's writing team has this ability to write characters that are actually worth caring about. This compelling narrative is what we, as RPG fans, play for. It isn't about the level grind (though, there is very little in Mass Effect) - it's about the subplots, the intricacies of the different races and how they relate to each other. There's a depth to the setting that just isn't present in most other games that can't afford this level of exposition - and the game is all the better for it.    The game's primary adversary, Saren, barely registers for most of the game. It's his actions that form the cat-and-mouse chase that the story takes you on, but by the end, his character reveals more complexity than your typical one-dimensional science fiction villain. His involvement with the Geth is explained by the end and it reveals some twists that you really won't see coming.    If anything, the game's storyline hugs curiously closely to the works of acclaimed sci-fi author Frederik Pohl of 'Gateway' and 'Heechee' fame. Tales of humans coming upon alien technology - and the sometimes ethical and moral issues this raises - sits at the heart of both storylines. It would be interesting to see if there are some Pohl fans deep inside the BioWare nest; we think there must be. Like a good novel, the game's setting is rich and deep - free to be explored at the player's wishes, rather than through forced cutscenes.   A codex in the main radial features an encyclopaedic reference tool that covers everything from races and customs to planets, key figures, items, and companies. All of this is performed by a voice-over too, for a further touch of class. Presentation-wise, Mass Effect exudes minimalist futurism, keeping menus uncluttered and direct. Every line of dialogue in the game is acted with conviction and skill - to the point where it makes most other voice-acted scripts look horribly amateurish by comparison.    We wish we could heap the same praises on the graphics. On one hand, the design ethic is flawless. The future of office buildings, bars, mining tunnels, small interplanetary cargo freighters and even military garb and weapons are convincing and logical. But the textural detail comes at a hefty price - there is an appalling amount of texture pop-in that actually starts to affect the poignancy of cutscenes which are otherwise engrossing. Any time you enter a new environment after a load, it can take anywhere from three to seven seconds for textures to pop in. We even remember one instance later in the game where we were walking through a hangar bay that looked like a blank textural canvas until each layer of texture slowly popped into place piece by piece - taking about nine or ten seconds - by which time we'd reached the area exit. Yeesh.    When it all comes together, Mass Effect is simply an excellent RPG. It's not quite perfect and there are some issues that need addressing before the inevitable sequels, but this is the good stuff.  Being completely honest, the lip synching is pretty good but not great. Strangely enough, when the alien races like the reptilian Krogan and the skeletal Turians speak, they actually look much more convincing and lifelike. This is because their mouth animations are exaggerated, whereas the humans merely end up looking like they're mumbling. The eyes, on the other hand, are where a lot of the emotion actually comes from. They're piercing, evocative and work well with the furrowed brows and subtle lines that form when characters talk. It's still awesome stuff, even after watching hours of exposition.   The slowdown is more of an issue. During heated battles where there are more than four or five enemies on the screen, the game's framerate drops away. Sure, there are a lot of effects and elements at work behind the scenes, but sometimes a split-second shot that could save your life is marred by a slow skip in the framerate, leaving poor Commander Shephard a ragdolling husk on the ground as the scene fades to red.  All of this is hardly enough to dull the radiant sheen of the rest of the game. For most gamers, it will hardly register at all. You'll be too captivated by the setting and likely the gradual upgrading of your gear; you'll be too busy exploring the strange escalating love triangle you can tinker with. You'll be collecting medallions, scanning planets for elements, metals, minerals, and gases. You'll talk a Krogan out of shooting you, charm your way through some conversations, flex your muscles in others. Heck, you'll even have to deal with a couple of nuclear devices before the game wraps up. BioWare has once again shown why they still stand at the top of the RPG tower, as Mass Effect does deservingly wear the 'epic' moniker.", "date": "Nov 20, 2007"}
