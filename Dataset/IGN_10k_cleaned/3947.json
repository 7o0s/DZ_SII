{"name": "AquaNox 2: Revelation", "name_review": "Aquanox 2 Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/23/aquanox-2-review", "text": "Back in 2001 the team at Massive Development set out to create a fun, underwater sea adventure (no, this isn't a plug for The Little Mermaid) in which players could duke it out against sea pirates beneath the murky depths of the ocean. The attempt was mediocre at best, and left players desiring more. The graphics couldn't save the inconsistent storyline and ridiculous controls.    Enter 2003, and a second attempt is born. The game begins with a wonderful pre-rendered video which details the time that transpired between the story's present day and original game. Shortly thereafter, you find yourself lured out by a distress call, only to find it's a ploy to draw you away from your massive family freighter. Upon your return, you are humbled to find pirates have taken control, and really don't have any intent on giving your ship back any time soon. Lucky for you, they have no desire to kill you, perhaps making your services somewhat available. It looks like you're clearing your schedule for the next few months. Let's pencil in ~be the pirates' bitch~ for the 13th, shall we?    The game is held together with a fairly archaic interface in which you simply click on a 2D representation of your ship and find yourself in respective locales. As you proceed to click on the Mess Hall, the Bridge and so forth, new areas will be open to click on as you follow the game's fairly linear storyline. At each location you'll find people who are less than eager to interact with you. Perhaps this shows through in the voice acting, as it seems uninspired and dry; however, this will be addressed later on. After most of the objectives for gathering background information on the story have been satisfied, it's time to hop into your ship and straight into the action.   The game follows the same basic formula that most space shooters employ: going on cargo runs, protecting your pirate infested freighter from other pirate attack, and escorting ships. There really is nothing profound that is offered that will set this game apart from all others in the genre. It isn't necessarily the dry mechanics that keep the game from being fun, however. The lack of enjoyment rests with the control scheme and game design. Still following in the footsteps of the original, Aquanox 2 employs extremely difficult control. Unlike most space shooters in which the controls invariably make or break the game (as a consequence the controls in said games are usually extremely tight and tweaked), Aquanox's controls are very loose and unresponsive. Using the mouse is virtually useless as you'll find yourself throwing the camera from side to side in a vain attempt to lock on to a target. Strafing is jerky and awkward. Even with a joystick the controls still seem to be much too sensitive. When a game is this hard to control, it makes it extremely difficult to enjoy.    Nav points are scattered throughout the missions in an attempt to guide the player through the sporadic level designs. Without these Nav points, you'd constantly be lost. However, even with this assistance, it is still often more difficult than necessary to find the next Nav point, as the designers have placed giant obstacles in the way of your ship and objectives. Simply cruising over top of them just isn't an option as your depth is limited to a very short range. Underwater mountain ranges are littered throughout the levels, causing frustration rather than a challenge. Perhaps a blessing in disguise, the missions are extremely short, as objectives are often met quickly and without much effort. Dogfights with other ships seem harder than they should be initially due to the sloppy control scheme. Once the player becomes more accustomed with the controls, the game then becomes too easy, leaving a balance to be desired. The interim game time is filled with massive amounts of dialogue that for the most part remain uninteresting. The story isn't overly exciting to begin with, and the pace that the designers set never leaves much room for expansion on the mood or feel; overall, it feels like you're finishing each mission in a vain attempt to find an upcoming mission that just might be...well, good.      The graphics are fairly average. There isn't all that much that is different from the original Aquanox. The game isn't quite as bright as the original, which boasted superb color palettes and excellent texturing. But what passed for commendable nearly two years ago doesn't quite make the cut in 2003. The game doesn't take advantage of many of the new abilities of today's graphics cards. On a relatively fast machine this does, however, keep the game running quite smooth. But for those with a top-of-the-line gaming rig who want to pump their visual settings to the max are going to be disappointed. The in-game menus and character art are crisp and effective. Yet, when a game's pre-rendered laurels impress greater than that of the gameplay, problems begin to arise.      While the underwater darkness provides a more realistic experience, it makes it extremely difficult to see objects, with the player constantly bumping into deliberately placed obstacles (attempting to cover up already short missions, the sadistic folks at Massive almost seem to enjoy painfully lengthening your time on each mission).  To heighten your underwater experience, the game is designed to make you feel like you really are piloting a ship underwater. While this may seem all well and good for a simulation, this game is much more action oriented, consequently making everything feel extremely sluggish. Even the speedometer doesn't lie as some of the fastest ships boast a top speed of 80 Km/h (that's about 50 miles an hour). Accordingly, even the most action-packed sequences seem labored and unnatural. While the game does give the player the option of upgrading the scout ship to be faster and better equipped, most of these upgrades can be salvaged at the conclusion of missions, making the need to purchase upgrades virtually obsolete. This is just one of the many reasons why the game just feels too easy.    The sound department leaves much to be desired. The lackluster voice acting is at some points laughable, as you can practically visualize the actors reading from a page. While this is not how the entire game presents itself, the occasional brutal dialogue does detract from the experience. The sound effects are appropriate for an underwater shooter, yet don't do anything to dazzle the player. The music is upbeat, and does make the missions feel a little more intense, although in the end, it is still the same boring gameplay. It is in this reviewer's opinion that while a lot of developers create music to compliment, it is sometimes imperative to make music enhance the experience. The music in Aquanox 2 falls somewhere in between, sometimes being noteworthy, and other times fading into nothingness.     All in all, Aquanox 2 falls short of being something new and enjoyable, and is a disappointing sequel. The game tries and fails at most conceivable junctures, making the gaming experience a frustrating one, to say the least. The combat is boring and for the most part unchallenging. The story is loosely tied together with poor dialogue and an uninteresting plot. With no multiplayer mode to speak of, this one won't last on your hard drive too long.  In an age of recreation rather than innovation, developers struggle to improve on their works from the past. While it may be a worthy cause, they sometimes seem to lose sight on their (or at least player perceived) ultimate goal of creating a game that is fun to play, and doesn't just simply fix things that were wrong with the original game, like a giant $40 dollar patch. Unless you were a diehard fan of the original, I'd say give this one a pass.", "date": "Sep 23, 2003"}
