Especially one as uninspired as Ancient Wars: Sparta - a plodding war game set between 500 - 450BC that charts the epic struggle for Mediterranean supremacy between the Spartans, Persians and Egyptians. While the success of Zack Snyder's recently released celluloid epic 300 will no doubt help Sparta shift a few copies, the game is unlikely to win many plaudits on merit alone.   After countless months of hype, promising us FPS-level visuals and groundbreaking physics, along with three titanic and diverse campaigns, the final result is positively under-whelming. Perhaps Sparta's PR machine has been stuck in some temporal vortex these past few years, because, visually, Ancient Wars is more Stronghold Legends than Quake IV - despite a solid physics engine that sees felled units knocked to the ground with satisfying force and walls sagging, creaking and crumbling when pummelled by siege weapons.     First impressions are further sullied by some meandering, atrociously acted and uninspired dialogue, delivered by actors bereft of subtlety and emotion. The result is tedious, characterless exposition that wouldn't be out of place in a turgid history lesson. Delivered for the most part with utter disinterest, you're even treated to unintentionally comic gems like Persian archers saying, ~My bow serves Persia~ - with the word bow pronounced like the thing you'd do if you met the Queen.   Almost every facet of Sparta looks like it's been lifted straight from a basic RTS template. The three factions - Persia, Sparta and Egypt - lack unit variety, though each side's collection of buildings is distinctively different, capturing the flavour of the respective culture's architecture with aplomb. What's more, structures gradually degenerate the more punishment they take, which is also a great touch.     The legendary Spartans possess the most powerful infantry units, most notably the fearless Hoplite warriors who held back the Persian tide at Thermopylae all those centuries ago. The Persians boast several less powerful infantry units, though the intimidating Immortals are almost a match (both in prowess and price) for their Spartan counterparts. The faction can also call upon hulking War Elephants, capable of squishing enemies into mush while two riders rain down death from its back. Egypt has by far the most uninspired collection of troops, though their clumsily named Throwing Machine - which launches hails of arrows - is an excellent addition, forcing opposing armies to genuinely fight in the shade.   Sparta's template will be instantly familiar to any fan of the genre - build base, build army, attack enemy, repeat. Powered by three resources, Gold, Wood and Food, your war effort begins by setting your peasants (who infuriatingly have to be individually located and selected) to work, constructing buildings, chopping wood, harvesting crops and gathering nuggets of gold from nearby mines. The main problem with the game doesn't lie in its lack of originality though - rather, it's the abundance of overly funnelled levels and the pedestrian pace in which armies are mustered. It's quicker to grow a beard than it is to amass a substantial enough force capable of assailing an enemy stronghold, a problem further hampered by the constant streams of predictable enemy sallies that chip away at your lovingly nurtured forces.     The majority of battles can hardly be called thrilling either, generally relying on mass, mindless brawls bereft of serious tactical options. Fortunately, later encounters do become far more satisfying once numbers are swelled, strongholds built and more powerful units unlocked. If you're willing to put in the time, you'll find that Sparta does slowly begin to morph into a vaguely entertaining war game, though whether you're prepared to invest that much of your life in order to get there is another matter.     Visually and tactically, these later skirmishes are far more enjoyable than each campaign's limp early encounters. Hordes of cavalry crash into wavering enemy infantry lines, while siege towers rumble towards vast, arrow-spitting enemy walls. Ranged units intelligently hold back and unleash their loads from a safe distance, while new warriors can be placed on horses if their original riders are felled. Best of all, Persian War Elephants can rip through lines of men like scimitars through warm butter, before stampeding wildly as they die, indiscriminately crushing anyone and anything in their path.   Despite its general predictability, Sparta does possess enough flickers of originality to set it apart from the wealth of RTS mediocrities on the market. Easily its most compelling feature is the ability to equip your troops with a variety of different primary and secondary weapons, and shields. As enemies press in all around your city walls, equipping a collection of cheap, quickly trained ranged units to repel the attackers can prove the difference between victory and capitulation, while bolstering your ranks with troops armed with the finest weapons can give you that much needed advantage over a superior enemy force. The decision is yours.     While these glimmers of innovation do help raise Sparta above the mire, there are simply too many shortfalls and by-numbers features here to be able to recommend it. There's a real lack of polish throughout, with some poorly written/translated text, infuriating AI shortfalls that see your troops ignoring retreat commands in order to rush an enemy stronghold every time its main gate opens, while a little more player guidance and objective clarity also wouldn't have gone amiss. Throw in some uninspired level design that sees you channelled down set routes, painful acting, plus seemingly lifelong waits to create substantial armies and you're left with a throwback to a bygone era where this kind of strategy game was still acceptable. When placed side by side with the likes of Medieval II: Total War and Supreme Commander, Sparta looks positively ancient in comparison.Timely as its arrival may be, its hard not to feel that Ancient Wars: Spartas release was no coincidence, carefully planned to ride the coattails of 300 in a desperate attempt to shift more copies of an unspectacular product. Despite its clever marketing plan, the fact remains that, unlike the Spartans at Thermopylae, Ancient Wars: Sparta is an underdog without the tools to worry its more heavily equipped rivals. This is one battle that history will be quick to forget.", "date": "Apr 18, 2007"}
