Many so-called RPGs simply don't allow the player to properly embrace the character they're playing. That's one of the reasons sci-fi role-player Mass Effect is so refreshing: it goes some significant way toward making you actually - you know - play a role, rather than flapping behind a thin veil of hammy dialogue and redundant decision-making.   Take Mass Effect's much-touted conversation system for instance: whenever you engage another character, the game hits you with options so wide-ranging and subtle you soon break out of standard game practice - selecting a perfunctory response to progress things as quickly as possible - and start to build a genuine personality for your character.     As an example, within 10 minutes of playing, we were choosing dialogue to fit my guy's face - and the background I had chosen for him, where he was the survivor of a terrible accident in space, one of three options you get at the start. He was curt, no nonsense, a bit blunt, but basically a good guy. Navigating the trees of dialogue here is so deep, so complex you can genuinely shape the game's hero, galactic defender Commander Shepard, into a person. It's a gradual process, but over time it reaffirms your faith in the power of games to tell stories.   In fact the way the dialogue is blended into the game itself is nothing short of sensational. Mass Effect is about a third talking, a third action, a third leveling, making items and skilling up your characters, but the game's structured so carefully you never get a chance to get bored of one bit of it. All the areas of the game overlap - skill up your character's Charm ability, and you can influence conversations; mess up a chat and you're in a firefight.   It's slower paced than most games too, but that's not necessarily a bad thing and it keeps up with much pacier rivals in the crucial area of keeping you rooted to your sofa for hours. Remember, this is from BioWare, creators of the excellent Knights of the Old Republic, and in terms of gameplay Mass Effect doesn't radically shift away from the KOTOR formula of incremental upgrades, item collecting and harvesting, and fantastically complex skill systems. But it's still more than KOTOR; it's KOTOR with a serious adrenalin boost.     Battles are real-time and look pretty tasty, with some neat outdoor skirmishes across moonscapes and shootouts through space stations. Enemies move fast and thankfully your team-mates are pretty smart at staying in behind cover, otherwise it would be rock hard. The first time you get jumped by a Husk - a hideous, drained alien victim who runs up to your team and damages the living daylights out of you - is genuinely scary. When both your team-mates have been downed - you can revive them after fights - and you have to take on three evil roboot Geth with a shotgun, it really is properly white-knuckle. Indeed, this does adrenalin better than 99 per cent of RPGs.     That said, it doesn't pay to fall asleep at the wheel when it comes to skill points, weapon upgrades and other RPG staples. Right from the start you're backed up by two characters (you can swap them later) and have to command your team-mates in battle, and also pay attention to doling out equipment and skills to balance up shooting and 'biotic' - read: magic - abilities. It looks like a third-person shooter - the heavy use of cover gives it a distinct flavour of Gears of War - but even when you're popping headshots at Geth you have to keep an eye on skill points, damage points, armour and the like or you're toast. Even picking between several identical-looking shotguns can be the difference between life and death.     The targeting system and AI are good but sheer aiming skills alone won't get you through - kills only occur when you've got a red lock-on symbol, basically - and your RPG-style team management skills become the most important thing. Even in the biggest fights you'll be doing RPG-style things like accessing big menus of skills every two or three seconds. That's not to say that the combat isn't exciting - it is. It's just that it's RPG exciting, not FPS exciting.   As is traditional with RPGs, Mass Effect is a big game. Simply because the plot's so much better-written than most RPGs you do tend to stick to the main storyline more, but there's a lot to look at and a lot of people to talk to out there. That said, the universe of Mass Effect isn't fluid - inside space stations, you'll have several distinct locations to visit but won't be able to visit anywhere else. In the places you go you're also shepherded towards people who have something to say pretty efficiently, which cuts down on KOTOR's occasional moments where you'd simply talk to every single person you saw until something happened.   In space, likewise, you pick planets you can visit off a galaxy map - a lot of planets, sensibly enough, have environments so hostile you can't touch down - then visit five or six places of interest on them, usually scoring a side quest, a fight, and maybe an item upgrade as you do so. But it's stuck together well enough that it feels huge. In fact the first time you jet out of a space station and realise you can set the navigation controls for dozens of planets you do think, 'Wow, I'm in space.'      It's that sort of 'Wow' that is Mass Effect's big sell. No game has done playable dialogue better than this. No RPG has blended action and stats like this. No space exploration game has given you such an astounding, detailed galaxy to explore. No game has ever delivered this sort of rich, nuanced plot and made you feel so much a part of it. And the best part? This huge, multi-ending epic is just the first part of a trilogy. The only possible response to that is, 'Wow'.  Mass Effect is a giant leap forward for videogames in terms of storytelling and its probably the biggest, most sophisticated game on Xbox 360. But with combat requiring you to dip into menus every few seconds, it isnt likely to win over the Halo brigade - and with this much dialogue, its not going to be your bag if youre the guy who hits start every second in an effort to get characters to stop talking.", "date": "Nov 19, 2007"}
