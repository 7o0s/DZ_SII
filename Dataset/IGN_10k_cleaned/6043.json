Oh yeah, and you can shoot them. Sound like fun? Crystal Dynamics is hoping so.  The one thing this game has going for it is it's fast. Really fast. You fly along in your monster truck, bouncing over rough terrain, collecting weapons and power-ups, all the while avoiding other drivers who's sole purpose is to prevent you from finishing the race. They swarm around like insects, and are sometimes incredibly hard to shake.  On first try, Off World Interceptor is a lot of fun. But you soon begin to realize it's pretty much a one-trick pony. Each race is exactly the same, barring some minor changes in the tracks. The graphics are passable, and the control decent enough. It's just not an entertaining enough game to hold your interest.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
