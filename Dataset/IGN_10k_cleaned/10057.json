It was only a matter of time before the King of Fighters franchise came to the Virtual Console  after all, it's pretty much undeniable that it's the most notable and important brand to ever come from the Neo Geo. And it's only a matter of a little more time before we see even more installments of the same series arrive  after all, this is a fighter that's been reimagined with nearly annual installments on at least 10 different occasions in the past 14 years. Luckily, the prospect of revisiting more and more of them as the Virtual Console moves forward fills us with excitement and anticipation  King of Fighters is one of the best fighting franchises ever made (after all).   King of Fighters '94 is the first game to arrive on the VC, and was the first in a line of titles that included yearly numbered sequels in '95, '96, '97, et cetera, all the way up until 2003. Each of those updates tweaked the gameplay and character roster, and each has its own notable strengths and weaknesses  but as the game that laid down the foundation for all those many follow-ups afterward, KOF '94 may be one of the most appealing editions.   The game is a one-on-one versus fighter in the tradition of Street Fighter II, but innovates well beyond the template Capcom established and creates a more dynamic and engaging scenario. The team approach is the most significant and obvious difference  though KOF is a one-on-one fighter where only two characters fight at a time, each individual character is always accompanied by two companions. At the end of a round of combat, the loser is eliminated from the match and one of his two buddies steps in to take his place, while the winner stays in play (and usually doesn't recover from any damage he's suffered so far).   Each match can last to a maximum of five rounds, then, and a team isn't completely eliminated until all three of its members have fallen in battle. This is a system that other fighting franchises have since adopted and remixed, but the team approach was first born here in KOF '94. That's worth a tip of the hat.   Your comrades cheer you on in the background, while your active fighter brings the pain up front.  One of the side effects of always having to play as a team of three fighters is that you're forced to step up your game with multiple characters  this isn't a design where you can master the moveset of one single combatant and expect to go very far. At the very least you'll need to make yourself proficient with three different characters, the full compliment of a single team. And the characters you get to choose from are a bit restricted.   The character combinations, at least. The teams of three are set and established ahead of time in KOF '94, and you're not able to mix and match different men to create your own custom trio. That feature would be added in later editions of the series, but here you're locked in. Team Italy is made up of Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard and Joe Higashi of Fatal Fury fame, so fans of that franchise might find comfort with them. Team Mexico stars a trio that hail from SNK's Art of Fighting, including Ryo Sakazaki, Takuma Sakazaki and Robert Garcia. Team Japan is the ~signature~ King of Fighters team, and is headlined by Kyo Kusanagi  pretty much considered the main character of the greater King of Fighters franchise.   And Kyo is certainly one of the most enjoyable fighters to select in this version of KOF, as his moveset and fighting style show off the dynamism of the engine  King of Fighters '94 is fluid and satisfying to play, thanks to excellent animations for each character and the real sense of impact that each landed blow gives off. You're equipped with four attack buttons to use, including two kicks and two punches. But then combinations of those buttons activate more advanced techniques like ~attack avoidance~ (dodging) and charging your power. If you manage to find the time to do it in the middle of the fight, the charging ability is an interesting one to exploit  your character strikes a pose and glows with energy in a very Dragon Ball-esque manner that's amusing to witness, but perfectly appropriate for this style of fighter.   KOF works best as a two-player contest pitting you against a friend, but can also be enjoyed as a single-player experience  its story sequences there flesh out the background of the King of Fighters concept, and reveal the origins of the series and connections to past SNK fighting games. The final boss, Rugal, is no push-over either.Its actually pretty tough to come up with much of anything negative to say about King of Fighters 94, as its an impressive fighter thats a lot of fun to play, its historically significant, its innovative and its held up very well over the past 14 years. The issue of value worth considering, though, is the fact that this game just has so many sequels. And so many excellent sequels. The later, more recent versions of King of Fighters from 1995, 1996 and onward are certain to appear in the Wii Shop in the future, and so it might be worthwhile to some fans to consider waiting a while to see how SNK Playmore will choose to release those  900 Wii Points isnt the cheapest pricetag in the Shop, so a bit of patience might be advisable. For those who dont really care to wait, though, King of Fighters 94 earns a solid recommendation and will assuredly serve you well as a go-to fighter to call up from your Channel Array when friends come over and start talking trash. Its only a matter of time before they do, after all.", "date": "Feb 20, 2008"}
