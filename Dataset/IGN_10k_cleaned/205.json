But if Pac-Man is any indication, SNK is really looking to score some serious licenses for its library. Pac-Man on the NeoGeo handheld is a great score for the company  and it's a great first start in the company's quest for getting name-brand games for its system. Features Classic arcade gameplay  Pixel-perfect graphics, accurate sound effects   Two graphic modes: Scrolling and Full Screen  For NeoGeo Pocket Color  The NeoGeo Pocket Color version of Pac-Man is a pixel-for-pixel port of the arcade game. You know exactly what the game is about  maneuver a yellow mouth around a dot-filled maze, avoiding ghosts. Eat a power pill and you'll temporarily be able to nab ghosts for points. The game came out nearly 20 years ago, and it's definitely the most known of all videogames in history.  Because the resolution of the NeoGeo Pocket Color isn't high enough to accurately port the arcade version, SNK includes two versions: Scrolling and Full Screen. Scrolling is the pixel-for-pixel port, but the screen scrolls to follow Pac-Man through the maze. The Full Screen mode cuts the detail to fit the entire maze on-screen. The graphics look a little on the funky side in this mode, but if you want to see everything, you have to play it this way.  Compared to the recently-released Game Boy Color version, the NeoGeo Pocket Color version of Pac-Man is better: the graphics are absolutely identical to the arcade, right down to the amount of dots on the screen. The speed of the game is also the same as the arcade, and the sounds are as close as you can get without featuring digitized audio.  Problem is, Pac-Man may be better on the NeoGeo Pocket Color, but that's all you're going to get. On the Game Boy Color version, you not only get Pac-Man, but you get a great link-cable two player option as well as a port of the SNES and Genesis puzzle game Pac-Attack. The NeoGeo Pac-Man is a perfect port of the arcade game, but that's it. Pac-Man's a great game, even to today's standards. The NeoGeo Pocket Color version is fantastic  my only complaint is the joystick is a little on the loose side, making Pac-Man turn a corner when you want him to keep going straight. The controls take a little getting used to. I also wish SNK could have included more options  Pac-Man might not be enough for some gamers. The Game Boy Color version is definitely the better buy, in options and features. In gameplay, I'd rather play Pac-Man on the NeoGeo Pocket Color.", "date": "Sep 4, 1999"}
