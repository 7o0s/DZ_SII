It's become habit ever since that whenever a top-down racing game hits a videogame system it's immediately compared to Micro Machines because the original is just that hard to beat. Some manage to trounce the Codemasters design, while others miss the point completely. And in what's officially being branded as the fourth version of the series, Micro Machines V4 gets some things right but fails to evolve the franchise to match current generation racers. It also doesn't help that the overambitious track designs wreak havoc on the pacing of the Nintendo DS production, but we're getting ahead of ourselves.It's hard not to love the concept of Micro Machines: racing tiny inch-long vehicles through real-world locations. Gardens, garages, game rooms, even bathtubs, pool tables, and hen houses become massive tracks when you're micro-sized, and it gives track designers a lot of creative room to build some courses using household items and locations.  Micro Machines V4 on takes the classic overhead racing creation that started back in the late 80s on the 8-bit NES machine and builds off its evolution that hit the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 systems in the form of Micro Machines V3 and Micro Machines 64, respectively. Micro Machines V4 is more focused on recreating and retooling the previous version of the game, which makes sense since the previous versions successfully brought the classic game into the world of 3D. The Nintendo DS version is actually a conversion of the PlayStation 2 and PSP games that hit the scene earlier this year. The original intention was to have the games hit simultaneously but somehow along the way the Nintendo DS version strayed longer in development than the other two versions. The extra time in the cooker didn't seem to work to the advantage of this dual-screen rendition as the DS version of Micro Machines V4, while playable and challenging, is the weakest of the trio.It's not a secret that the Nintendo DS is also the weakest of the three systems in terms of technical capabilities, so to expect the same level of visual and audio presentation would be a little insane. That said, though, this portable version lacks the intensity and tightness of the Micro Machines series mainly because the graphic engine just can't keep up with the product. The framerate is a chunky mess half the time which muddies up any sense of speed the game can offer. The designers have definitely brought down the level of detail from the PS2 and PSP game to try to keep things smooth, and in some cases the hacked up visuals are laughable -- vehicles aren't much more than angular, generic cardboard boxes.It's the track designs that are probably killing the potential for a fast and smooth frame rate, as they've clearly been created with the power of a 3D system like the PlayStation 2 or PSP in mind. When a track leaves the floor and heads up to the surface of a table you can still see the other parts of the course far down below, and it's in these instances where the screen refresh takes a dive on the Nintendo DS. When the track stays on a flat surface or doesn't try anything too fancy the framerate stays at an acceptable rate, but when you start throwing weapons around that's when it dips into the ~choppy~ range.It's not just the framerate that chugs things up. It's also in the control, too. The programmers employ a self-correcting routine in the vehicles that keep your car going as straight as possible, which gives the steering a somewhat disconnecting and mushy feel since you're not in full control of its handling. It's nice that the designers want to assist the players so they're not oversteering while trying to go straight, but please guys...you should have made this an editable option for those who've lived through the last three versions of Micro Machines and their handheld spin-offs.Ultimately much of the gameplay remains intact even if the presentation ends up being a little scattered. There are multiple cups of increasing difficulty that require different tasks in order to unlock the different modes. The ~race~ is you against three others in a three lap race. ~Battle~ is the old-school multiplayer design from the NES days where split-screen wasn't an option; the idea is to force the other racers off-camera for points. Of course, if you want to race against other opponents there's a multiplayer mode as well that uses the Nintendo DS networking option, but it requires multiple carts. And while it would have been cool to head online to race other players, this is strictly a local wireless affair.  When the designers brought the game to the Nintendo DS, not a whole lot of thought was placed into what, exactly, should be done to ~DS-ize~ the product. Players can turn on a touch-screen steering mechanic where they can slide the stylus over a virtual steering wheel to turn their car. But it's an absolutely terrible option that just doesn't work. The lower screen is only used to chart the strength and position of the computer opponents and nothing else. Hell, the  clich ~throw a map down there~ would have been better than what ended up on the lower display. And there's not much to the evolution of the series either. There's no overhead map, players don't get their best times clocked and recorded, nor can they even see how far away the computer AI opponents are away from you in the race. Once opponents are off-screen, you have no way of tracking how far away they are or if you're gaining on them with every skillful turn. Basic racing niceties are not included in Micro Machines V4 and in this day and age it's hard to ignore their omission.The original Micro Machines still holds up as one of the real racing classics in gaming's past, and it's the posterchild for top-down racers. The game's managed a successful run over nearly two decades, but Micro Machines V4 ends up missing a lot of opportunities to live up to the namesake, at least on the Nintendo DS. Chuggy framerates, mushy controls, laughable vehicle designs, and a scattered game progression and presentation spotlight admittedly solid and faithful gameplay and clever track designs. There's some fun in this game, but if you want to see what made Micro Machines such a strong franchise, look into its past renditions.", "date": "Dec 20, 2006"}
