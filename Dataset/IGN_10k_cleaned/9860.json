The Virtual Console, stocked as it is with almost 200 different retro downloadables so far, has been surprisingly sparse with the puzzle games. We got Columns and Wario's Woods early on, both of which are solid designs. Then we got Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine and Kirby's Avalanche, both of which are actually the same design. But since then, not much else. Not any of the installments of Nintendo's own Dr. Mario even, and certainly not any Tetris.   But puzzle gaming might be coming back into play today, as now available in the Wii Shop is Namco's take on the falling-block Tetris concept, Pac-Attack. This one plays similarly to Tetris in that the primary goal is to complete horizontal rows of blocks across an initially empty playing field. Getting in the way, though, are Pac-Man's signature enemies, the ghosts.   Red ghosts fall into the field along with sections of blocks, and they're meant to obstruct your constructions  you can't complete a horizontal line if there's a ghost taking up one of the spaces in the chain. After every few drops from the top of the screen, though, one set of pieces will appear that includes Pac-Man himself. When he lands in the field, he'll immediately gobble up any ghosts that are horizontally adjacent or below him, clearing them out of the way and letting you get back to your business of building more blocks.   Pac-Man's hunger is still insatiable, even after two and a half decades.  It's a fairly simple concept overall  the problem with it, though, is Pac-Man's restricted movement. Because he only chomps in one direction at a time, it's often difficult to position him in the proper way. The computer's set patterns dictate his movement without any input from you, so you've got to learn ahead of time the method to his madness  ~if I set him here, will he chomp the ghost to his right first, or will he eat the ghost below him first?~ It's not immediately intuitive to be able to predict his path, and that can be frustrating to handle.   Pac-Attack also includes a Puzzle Mode that's focused on clearing out all the ghoulies in a limited set of moves, so any aggravation you may experience from Pac-Man not moving the way you think he will will be magnified there. It doesn't feel like the Puzzle Modes in other similar games, either. The take-your-time, strategic quality of planning out your set of moves and then executing them to perfection  like you'd do in the SNES classic Tetris Attack, for example  isn't so much present here. It's still mostly similar to the normal mode of play.   A two-player competitive mode is here and is always fun to see, as it can be fun to watch a friend or family member get crushed underneath a mound of glowing ghosts while your side of the screen is comparatively empty  but to play this mode, you'll need either two Classic Controllers, two old GameCube pads, or one apiece of each of those. Pac-Attack, because it comes from the SNES, doesn't support the lone Wii Remote as a control option. It seems more than a little ridiculous, too, in a game like this that really doesn't need that many buttons  and it's also even more absurd considering that Pac-Attack also came out on the Genesis in 1993, so the Wii Shop selection squad could have picked that version instead and it would have worked with just the Wiimote. Oh well.It's great to see a fresh puzzle game finally arrive on the Virtual Console, but Pac-Attack isn't one that's going to amaze many players. It's a fair design, but its frustrating elements like the sometimes-unpredictable Pac-Man paths and non-support of the lone Wii Remote keep it from earning an immediate thumbs-up for potential downloaders. Dedicated puzzle gaming fans will likely still want to check it out despite its drawbacks, but more casual Wii owners might want to wait for more puzzlers to pick from  hopefully, games like the N64's classic Tetrisphere and Tetris Attack from the SNES will hit the Wii Shop soon. And we can also still be looking forward to Dr. Mario & Virus Buster, the upcoming WiiWare version of that classic Nintendo puzzle design.", "date": "Jan 16, 2008"}
