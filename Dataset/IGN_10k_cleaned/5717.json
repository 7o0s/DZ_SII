{"name": "Kingdom of Heaven", "name_review": "Kingdom of Heaven", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/04/28/kingdom-of-heaven-3", "text": "When we originally previewed Kingdom of Heaven earlier this year, we praised Sorrent's decision to turn its back on the obvious banal action game the film's theme would have easily allowed. ~Two young warriors defend Jerusalem during the First Crusade? Death and destruction? Swords and gore? Quick, what middle-tier developer can we call to fart out a quickie slasher in eight weeks?~ Nay! Such a rueful fate is not for Sorrent.   We played the final of Kingdom of Heaven on an LG VX8000, and thusly must sing its praises again. This is a engaging action/puzzle game cerebral enough to captivate fanciers of thinking games, but with an exciting action element (death loves to swoop down from above in the form of fireballs and arrows) that may rope in a considerable number of the twitch crowd.   Instead of beating back the hordes of plundering knights with your blade, you must instead play the role of protector, switching back and forth between Balian (Orlando Bloom) and Sybilla (Eva Green). Your mission, spelled out at the onset of each level (there are ten), is to rescue the trapped and helpless citizens of Jerusalem. You are given a requisite number of innocents to save, but there are always more peasants cowering in fear than required to finish a level. This mechanic reveals a certain depth to Kingdom of Heaven you might miss if you only give the game a cursory look. In order to rescue the extra innocents, you must explore the city blocks in greater detail, seeking out alternate routes and secret passages. What was once a quick three-minute level perfect for jamming between classes can evolve into a ten-minute challenge over lunch.   Gathering up innocents is as easy as walking into them. Once part of your group, they follow you like Lemmings, but will not purposefully put themselves in harm's way. (That's actually up to you.) For example, your hero can jump through fire, but timid peasants are apt to hang back. But you can get these poor people killed if you are not careful; lose too many to crashing fireballs or volleys of skin-splitting arrows and it's game over.   You must always be on the lookout for power-ups that help you overcome the hazards and open new paths. Buckets of water can be used to extinguish flames -- but you can only use them once. With a set number of buckets in each level, you must be judicious with your aqua distribution decisions. If you put out the wrong fire, you may clear the easy route, but you will miss some unfortunates that are walled off by other patches of flames. Battering rams help you knock down doors and open up new paths, but you must have three innocents with you to use them. There are many locked doors to crash through, but again, going for the most direct route can potentially cost lives.   Kingdom of Heaven employs solid production values. The game makes good use of digitized stills from the movie, and the presence of the theme music in clear, crisp MP3 format is excellent. The in-game characters are well drawn and animated -- even if they are a bit on the generic side. The cityscape, however, has quite a bit of detail, full of crumbling stone, overturned carts, and imposing doors. Sorrent even squeezed some digitized speech into the game, as your hero spouts a rousing ~Follow me!~ when coming in contact with an innocent.Kingdom of Heaven successfully walks the precarious tightrope that so many action/puzzle games topple from. Collecting the innocents requires serious thought in later levels -- especially if you want to save them all from death at the hands of the Crusaders. However, raining death and a nasty time limit add a level of urgency that may satisfy more action-oriented gamers. More than anything, I appreciate that Sorrent looked long and hard at the movie and decided against the easy road -- even if that does turn off gamers looking for a simple action fix. But give Kingdom of Heaven and you will be surprised at its depth. The ten levels can be finished in a day if you are content with doing the bare minimum, but the longevity is there if you want it. A solid game to the core.", "date": "Apr 28, 2005"}
