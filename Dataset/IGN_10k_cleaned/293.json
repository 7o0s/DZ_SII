Sure, it has the elements of games like Bust-a-Move and Tetris, but this is by far one of the most original take on the genre I've seen so far. And it's a heckuva lot of fun to play, too.FeaturesNine levelsPuzzle modeEarn cards for spectacular playLink cable support for two playersFor NeoGeo Pocket ColorHere's the deal: you face a bin of colored shapes that hover above your ~pod.~ You can move your pod in nine different locations across the screen. The idea is simple: link two or more like colors together to eliminate that grouping. How? By throwing connectors up at the pile. When you want to link, say, a yellow target, you hit the a button to put up a connector. Keep throwing connectors until you've linked one target with the other  if that target isn't part of the original grouping of yellow targets, the two groups will disappear. Once that happens, the pieces will settle up into the pile  if the pieces create new groupings of two or more of the same color, those will disappear as well.There are two different types of games. In the main game, you have to eliminate the target pieces before the bin drops below the line, much like in Bust-A-Move  the pile is constantly dropping, and once a piece lands below the line, the game is over. You move onto the next level by connecting the two ~C~ pieces that show up after a few minutes of play. In the Puzzle game, you have to eliminate the entire bin of pieces in the fewest moves possible.I'm going to refrain from calling this a Tetris clone because it's not. It's more like Bust-A-Move, but even then that's not very accurate either. It's a cool idea that's extremely difficult to describe in so many words  but once you've wrapped your hands around a system and give it a go, you'll understand how the game works almost immediately. That's the key in a puzzle game  how intuitive it is. And Puzzle Link is extremely easy to learn  but damn hard to master.You can tell that this game is oriented towards the Japanese public  there's a silly incentive to beat the levels in the quickest time possible. If you beat the clock, you earn Pokmon-style cards that you can save to the battery. These do nothing more than show off how well you've performed in certain levels, but it's interesting to see what types of characters you can collect.I really like Puzzle Link  I was expecting nothing more than a Bust-A-Move clone (which is another one of my favorite puzzle games), and was happily surprised at how different this game is to the other puzzle clones out on the market. Puzzle Link continues the streak the NeoGeo is having so far, there hasn't been a stinker in the system's library. It's all about the games, and this system's got quite a few great ones in the bunch...Puzzle Link included.", "date": "Oct 7, 1999"}
