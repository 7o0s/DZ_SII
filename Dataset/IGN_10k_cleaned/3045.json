{"name": "Silent Scope 3", "name_review": "Silent Scope 3", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/10/11/silent-scope-3", "text": "Konami is a big, big game company. It's a worldwide publisher and developer with an HQ in Japan, as well as several development houses across that great island nation. It has a team in Hawaii, and bases in California and Europe. It makes a wide variety of games, for all different genres, including bringing home many of its arcade games to home systems. Their scope if huge, from Metal Gear Sold 2: Substance to NBA Starting Five to Disney Golf and Evolution Skateboading.    But something happens when you make this many games. Given the size and productivity of the company's output, the statistical average of high quality games versus, say, less than average games, is simply going to be lower, due to the company's huge outreach and, not surprisingly, its demanding financial expectations.   Where does Silent Scope fit into the equation? What is all this financial mumbo-jumbo? The arcade series that took light gun shooting and gave it a sniper rifle has always been good twitch fun in the arcades. It's easy to plunk down a quarter or four when you lift up that nice, heavy faux sniper rifle and one by one pick off evil polygonal terrorists. It feels real good. The scope gives a nifty, high-intensity magnification relative to the usually large arcade screen, and provides that perfect ratio of distance versus close proximity.    But the PlayStation 2 version of the first two Silent Scope games has never felt the same way, and unfortunately, Silent Scope III is no different. The sense of scale isn't quite right, the quarter-dropping tension/thrill isn't there, and most importantly, the lack of a sniper rifle in-hand on the PlayStation 2 version literally strips the player of the visceral, physical sensation of snipe-shooting. With that feeling essentially wiped out on the consoles, there is little left to like about the series.   But in the big scheme of things, in the big corporate picture, Konami's Silent Scope series makes simple sense on a console. It already exists in the arcades. It probably doesn't cost too much to port from the arcade to the PlayStation 2, and it'll probably make enough money to provide at least a minute profit stream. No matter that the first and second games hardly sold, or that they feel like stripped down versions of their arcade brethren. Or that they're less fun at home than in the arcades; or that they were missing a giant piece of the puzzle (the peripheral); or that they're extreme short-lived experiences. For Konami, in the big picture of its worldwide operations, bringing the third game in the series, Silent Scope III, back to PlayStation 2 seems like a no-brainer.    Gameplay  Therein lies the biggest Problem. Silent Scope III, in every visible aspect of its existence, is exactly the same game as Silent Scope and  Silent Scope: Dark Silhouette. It's a formulaic re-issue of been-there-done-that gameplay, which has not in any way blossomed or progressed since the first Silent Scope unit hit the arcades. The question that begs to be answered is: If you own the first or even the second game in the series, why buy the third?    Despite the two modes of play -- Silent Scope 3, which was specifically designed for the home version and proves to be very challenging with seven locations with varying degrees of difficulty, and Silent Scope EX, a step-by-step mission based game ported from the arcades -- Silent Scope III is simply a compilation of new missions that play out exactly like the previous two games in the series. Perhaps the most noticeable difference is that this set of levels takes two to three hours to beat rather than the requisite one-and-one-half hours.    To be fair, the enemy AI provides less room for mistake due to its higher activity level, and the levels are designed with more obstacles and fewer body parts at which to aim. The newer levels grow difficult quicker, too, directly after the second level. They steeply grow harder from there, each ranked with a difficulty level shown in a top-down map in the menu's interface, which enables players to select levels in a non-linear menu system.   Again, while you might breeze through the game the first time, players are rewarded with hidden stages, new gameplay modes and multiple endings, depending on the way you play, so indeed, there are benefits to playing again. Yet, even then, the game is extremely short in the replay department.   I can't tell if it's a good progression or not from the original game, but there appears to be a greater number of moving enemies bosses in this third version. These bosses appear on various moving airplanes and other objects, taking the game from the straight sniper levels down a more fast-paced light-gun pathway. It creates more tension and difficulty, to be sure, but it's also not quite the most natural fit for a sniper rifle. There is a strong sense of forced level design here, as if the developers were simply running out of ideas. Funny, I too felt as if I had played this game twice before... statistically speaking, of course.   Graphics and Sound  Exactly like its predecessors, Silent Scope III is, at best, a bearable looking game. The polygonal character models, the architectural structure of the buildings and everything in between was created with the most simplistic of visions. Granted, the game was an arcade game first, but compared to just about anything else on the system, arcade ports of this caliber look shoddily designed, skimpily textured, and crafted with little care for the overall product. It looks very much like a formulaic, rubber-stamped arcade game, rather than a 128-bit game on a next-generation system.    The other big difference between this game and its predecessors is that, technically, the sound effects have been separated out to create stereo sound effects. The end result is that players can hear footsteps from various parts of the game, or AI making scuffling noises from various parts of the screen, rather than just in front or behind them. It adds a minor layer of depth previous not available in the other two games.    But as is the case with the other two games, the scripts and voice acting are unbearably poor. Lines with this little thought given to them beg -- no, scream! -- to be rewritten. This is picture-perfect fodder for the folks who make Mystery Science Theater. Again, few people expect Metal Gear Solid 2-quality storylines or Legacy of Kain-quality voice actors from a light-gun game, but anything is better than this.Three strikes and you're out, Konami. Silent Scope III is a cookie cutter light-gun game offering little to nothing more than the content of the first two games. Slightly better sound quality, more moving targets, and a harder set of missions will either have you engaged or quickly returning this game in frustration. Our strong suggestion is that if you must play this game, rent it, and only rent it.", "date": "Oct 11, 2002"}
