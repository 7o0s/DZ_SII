There aren't any real mission goals and objectives, and while there is an underlying storyline, it doesn't really play a major role in the progress of the game. And instead of focusing on speed and power, the cars in the game are comprised up of primarily mini-cars that rely more on individuality and style than raw speed and acceleration.   Gameplay The main purpose of the game is to drive around the streets of the game's four cities, Rome, London, Tokyo and San Francisco, to collect the allotted amount of Dare Devil tokens under a preset time limit. There are a total of 27 levels that are split of between each of the four different cities, but the different levels are only different in that the tokens are placed in different areas of the map.   In addition to collecting the tokens, players can also search for and collect bonus items like keys and wrenches that provides players with continues and access to hidden levels. And to help players complete their missions, the streets are also littered with clocks, which add some extra time to the countdown clock, and nitros that gives them more speed.   While very simple and not at all varied, the game has a peculiar appeal that's most likely due to the fact that there's pretty much no rules that you must follow. In fact, you are rewarded points for crashing into other cars and destroying things like bus stops, benches, mailboxes and just about anything else that's in the background environments. It's a simple pleasure, but it can be a very rewarding one.   The only problem with this is that there's some inconsistency with what can be hit and knocked around. While just about everything that you can see can be busted up and knocked around, there are some things that will bring your vehicle to a grinding halt. One of which is a lamp post, which doesn't make any sense at all since you'll find yourselves knocking around stuff that are much harder to take out than a measly little lamp post.   The game's other problem, and probably it's most significant, is that the control of the vehicles is extremely abnormal. One would think that with the vehicles being mini-cars that they would have excellent handling and above-average turning radiuses, but that's the opposite. Making simple turns at medium-ranged speeds can be more of a hassle than it should and the only real way to get by in the game is to learn to powerslide at just about every single turn that you make. It takes a long time to get used to, but it is something that can be learned.   Graphics  It's pretty funny to think that when we first saw Top Gear Dare Devil in motion, which was at May's Electronic Entertainment Expo, it was a complete laughing stock and would've been the worst looking PlayStation 2 game of the show if it weren't for Gunslinger. The reason that this is funny is that the game has come a very long way since then and the developers at Papaya Studios must have been putting in some massive overtime since then because the game has turned out quite nicely.   The framerate, which was at less than 10 frames per second before, is now above 30 at most times and there's very little slowdown evident in the game. Additionally, the backgrounds feature some really high-quality textures in some areas and the lighting on the buildings creates a very life-like and believable atmosphere. The only real problem with the game's backgrounds is that some of the textures that look great and detailed from a certain distance will look very blurry when either extremely close-up or far in the distance.   The cars are also modeled extremely well and they look much like their real-life counterparts even if they don't have the licenses for the game to use their real names. They have plenty of nice little details, have very high-quality textures and just look very good.   Sound  The engine sounds are decent, but they're not anything that'll blow you away and most of the other sounds in the game can be stuffed into the same boat. There are plenty of squeaks, smacks, crashes and other environmental noises, but nothing is really bad or good so they're mostly not worth mentioning. The same thing can be said about the game's background music that's so painfully boring that it's not at all memorable.  Top Gear Dare Devil has its very fun moments and a special appeal, but it's definitely not a game for everyone and it also has some really strange flaws and problems. The game looks fantastic and features a very unique selection of cars, but it's not something that we would recommend to everyone. It's an acquired taste and is something that should be rented first before you decide to pick it up.", "date": "Dec 20, 2000"}
