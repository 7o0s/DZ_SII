Many out there understand the need for grind in these games, but just can't stomach days and weeks of repeatedly killing the same types of creatures, only to do it again with no real end goal in sight. Auran's Fury attempts to address that. It's strictly PvP (player versus player) combat. There's no overworld, no quests, and no real storyline. It's basically the same thing as an online shooter with lots of upgradeable skills and armors. While it brings together some interesting ideas, Auran's grafting of an arena shooter to an MMO has produced an awkward beast.   Think about the drive to play MMOs in the first place. It's basically a drug addiction. You hop into the world and soon get your first ~hit~ - either a powerful item, level up, new skill, or whatever. Then you search for the next high, but it's just not as thrilling as before, so you need something better. Eventually only the most powerful items will quell your craving. Once you realize this, one of two things happen: you burn out and bail or keep plowing forward because the hits still feel so good.   Fury doesn't really operate with the same kind of formula. The game ~world,~ if it can really be called that, is simply an unnecessarily large lobby where players can interact and form groups to queue up for three types of combat. Populating each zone is an overabundance of NPCs, many of whose functions seemed like they could have been consolidated. For instance, there are separate NPCs for armor condition and durability repairs. You can't sell items to any armor vendor; you have to go see a specific guy. There are way too many NPCs that hand out new or upgraded skills. It seems like Auran could have combined these functions and wound up with about 75 percent fewer NPCs and made it easier for the player to figure out what's going on. As it is, the NPC overpopulation makes it seem like Auran was just looking for an excuse to make the various oversized player lobbies feel less empty, which seem to exist solely to give you the faint illusion of an actual game world.    But there really isn't a game world here. There's a hack-job of a story told by a horrendously-voiced narrator and the lobbies, but really this game exists mostly in its combat arenas. By talking to one of the NPCs, you can enter Elimination, Bloodbath, or Vortex matches. Elimination is team deathmatch, Bloodbath is deathmatch, and Vortex is a variation on the standard capture the flag game type. Combat is mostly what you'd expect. You get roots, charges, heals, ranged damage spells, melee attacks, buffs, and debuffs. Skills are assigned to a hotkey bar, so the fighting is all 1 - 9 rinse, repeat; something you've done in many games before. The major difference here is most skills are on extremely quick cooldown timers, meaning combat is more fast-paced.   Gearing up for combat isn't really the same as what you're used to. You don't really level in this game, at least in the traditional sense, and there aren't any static classes. After each arena match you earn essence, the amount of which depends on how well you did and what type of skills you used. The four main types of skills are Decay, Life, Growth, and Death. These are basically all available to you, as long as you have the essence to buy them from NPCs.    Once you've got a few skills of whatever type, you have to decide what you want to slot on your action bar. Skills and equipment in this game cost equip points, which you have to keep under a limit. It's up to you to determine which tier of item or skill, of which there are 10 for each, you want to equip. Tier 10 items and skills have slightly more powerful damage, heal, or statistic ranges, but have an extremely high equip cost. We found it's just as worthwhile to equip around tier seven or eight to make the best use of equip cost cap room. Since there aren't any set classes, and your skills are only limited by how much essence you have to buy them, you can switch from damage dealing tank to healer to ranged caster to debuffer to anything. Or you can combine skills from all those class types to create whatever kind of crazy hybrid you want. Just keep in mind you'll be doing a lot of armor, skill and tier tweaking every time you decide to switch roles, though this process is facilitated by allowing you to save and store builds for later access.   While skills are purchased with essence, items can be acquired in a number of ways. After every match you're given a random assortment of items to put a claim on, which gives you a chance to win it. Even if the item isn't useful to the skill build you're using, you can still sell it for cash, which is added to the money you get after each match to buy items at vendors. Armor and weapon vendors are split into two types: those who sell randomly generated items and those who sell items with fixed statistics. The latter type of items is rather expensive, and the better ones require bulk donations of essence to faction members of the four skill types to access. With the random vendors, you pay a fee to have them crank out any piece of armor of tiers one through 10, which may or may not be useful to you. We've gotten quite a few good ~drops~ off of these guys, but ultimately it seems to be a rather large money sink.     The difference with Fury is to grind enough essence and money, you kill real players instead of boars, so that at least makes it somewhat interesting. The issue we had was with the general uselessness of many of the game's skills. Aside from the staple heals and damage attacks, there are many skills which you'd never really want taking up equip points on your action bar. These attacks do things like decrease a target's spiritual abilities by 12.3 percent, decrease physical offense by 10.63 percent, and many other obscure effects which you can barely notice on the battlefield. For every useful skill in the game, there seems to be two or more ineffective ones. The battle system could have benefited from a smaller number of more distinct skills. Basically, the game offers all the standard MMO skills along with loads of fluff.   While actually in combat, you'll find skills operate on a charge system. Some skills add charges, while the more powerful ones require specific amounts of accumulated charges to activate. The charges work in opposing pairs, so you can't simultaneously build something like fire and water charges, which is yet another factor you'll have to consider when setting up your build before a match. Then there are the in-game power-ups, which don't make any sense to us. You spend hours collecting just the right skills with just the right combinations of armor pieces, only to lose in Bloodbath because some other guy managed to get to the attack booster power-up before you did.    The fighting maps themselves are pretty small, which keeps the combat raging from the moment the gate opens to let you out into the field. It's really fast-paced, so it'll probably be a while before you really get the hang of it, especially if you've still got a bunch of useless skills sitting on your action bar. And for the love of God, get a healer in your group. These guys are practically invincible, and you're completely screwed in an Elimination match without one. But such is the way with any MMO PvP group encounter, isn't it?   Since launch, the game has experienced quite a few technical hitches. There seemed to be a massive amount of server lag on the first few days, causing vendor transactions and mail delivery to take over a minute to process. This seems to have been resolved now, but it's still something to be aware of.  There's likely a breed of PvP aficionado out there who loves what Fury has to offer. We salute you, whatever kind of statistic-obsessed, spreadsheet-worshipper you are. For us, the biggest problem we kept running into was boredom. Fury never once grabbed us like other MMOs or arena shooters. We weren't compelled to keep queuing up for deathmatches, or sprint back to vendors to upgrade our equipment or skills. So while it's a competent game, we simply couldn't get into it. The Casio keyboard-like sound effects and hit-or-miss fantasy graphics don't help. While some of the level designs are cool, there's not much of a feel to this game world. Auran's Fury was advertised as an MMO without the useless, fatty bits. A game that, allegedly, offers players the only part they want out of the online experience, which apparently means PvP. Turns out the game just offers too little to keep us interested, and some of what is there shouldn't have been included to begin with.", "date": "Oct 25, 2007"}
