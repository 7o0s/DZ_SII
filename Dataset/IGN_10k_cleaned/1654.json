{"name": "Maximum Pool", "name_review": "Maximum Pool", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/12/16/maximum-pool", "text": "Simulation games aren't really tough to make, but to make a simulation game fun, that's another story.  You can claim how realistic a certain plane feels in a flight simulator, but to me most flight simulators are as fun as watching weeds grow.  With that in mind, as I strolled into the snug offices of IGN, I watched Brandon sneak away from my desk area with a smirk on his face.  This obviously meant trouble.  I released an exasperated sigh as I picked up the final copy of Maximum Pool.  Not to rain upon Sierra's party, but are there that many Dreamcast owners interested in playing a pool game?  Nonetheless, I took up this burden with the same effort I review every Dreamcast game, and began playing.  A couple hours later, I was online, curving balls with some old English, comboing three balls at once, and even making the cue ball jump over other balls.  Actually, it was my online opponent, *CRUSH, who demonstrated these tricks as he beat me like a dummy.  But with that said, if I had to pick a pool video game to play, I'd rack up Maximum Pool.  Don't get me wrong, I haven't found a new gaming hobby with virtual pool games.  But for what it does and the surprising amount of time I spent, Maximum Pool is quite enjoyable, especially since for a simulation game, it's very easy to get into.  From the get go, you can select seven classic pool games, with five bonus games that can be unlocked by playing against the computer.  These bonus games are pretty cool, none more fun than the Poker Pool game, that not only requires you to hit balls in the pockets, but will also give you a poker hand to play at the same time.  The computer opponents are all digitized face images, and will often remark on how good/bad you play.  Most of the opponents play with the same amount of skill, with the exception of the evil pool hustling dog, Buddy.  This canine has some serious geometry knowledge because every time I play him, he'll hit 4 shots in a row, with no problem!  For the most part, the visuals in the game are average.  There's some weird slowdown when you move the stick around in certain angles, and sometimes it can be difficult to get an overhead close-up of a shot.  But overall, there's nothing outstanding about the visuals.  Then again it is a pool game so you can't really expect something on the level of a Soul Calibur.  If there's a shining point in the game, it's how easy you can start enjoying a pool video game.  The easy interface makes playing pool quite enjoyable, and I especially like the angle guides that enable you to determine the path of both the cue ball and the ball you're aiming for.  Plenty of play options and the bonus games definitely give replay value, but having online play gives this game a lot of replayability.  Since the game of pool isn't exactly ~high-intensity action~, playing Maximum Pool online is nearly lag free.  And yes, you can play other pool hustlers that own the PC version of the game.  As much fun as I had, Maximum Pool isn't a game I would own, and unless you're dying for the next game of virtual 8-ball, it's unlikely that readers will be interested in this game.  Still, for what it's worth, Maximum Pool, with it's online play and easy interface, is a solid Dreamcast pool game.    --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 16, 2000"}
