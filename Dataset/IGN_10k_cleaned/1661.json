You're full of a lot of questions, we know, but slow down for a minute, and think back to how this all started. You saw the GameShark package at your local software-plex, and you thought to yourself ~well I love my GameShark for my Nintendo/Dreamcast/PlayStation, maybe the PC version will be just as good.~ You wanted to be able to use the same range of odd codes for your games that you can in your console GameShark enhancers, like turning the lead character purple, allowing you to walk through walls, giving yourself infinite lives -- you know, all the classics you've come to know and love over the years. So you bought it, you brought it home, and you installed it. Then came the trouble, and the crying, and the crying again. Where did it all go wrong? Bad implementation.  GameShark PC is set up like a little web browser, and in fact it uses the GameShark.com website to download new info from. It's supposed to be a pretty simple setup, involving searching for the game you'd like a code for, checking the code or codes you want to implement, and starting the program from within GameShark. Instead of entering in the jibberish letter/number combinations you're stuck using in the console versions of GameShark, you simply click the options you'd like on and off to get the PC version running. New codes can be downloaded for use in the game as well, so you don't have to worry about keeping a printed list of new codes for your game, either. What's so surprising about all this is how such a simple setup could get botched so elaborately.  Take the code layout, for instance. If you want to search for a new code, you have to track down the individual game on the GameShark website, download the code file, get into GameShark PC, then add the new code into your program. Why there isn't a simple code update button, I'm not sure, but that's not necessarily the killer. What is the killer is the fact that during the time I tried to review the GameShark, the website refused to allow me to do a search, and at one point, crashed out completely when I tried to check on new codes for the game. Linking the code searches to a website is probably not a good idea, and forcing you to search for each and every new code you're interested in, when a simple download could do it all so much easier, is a double not good idea.  Once you've found your codes, then comes the real problem -- the absolute lack of logical code implementation. Enter a code into your console GameShark, and you can be pretty confident it will work -- the PC version, however, is a completely different story. I tried ten games off the bat, ranging from recent hits to older titles, and of them only one worked correctly. Some, like No One Lives Forever, just plain didn't work at all, while a bulk of them (Sacrifice, Crimson Skies, Roller Coaster Tycoon) crashed the game with a comment that I had a ~different version~ than one appropriate to the code, especially sad since I installed the bulk of the programs just for the sake of the review. At other times I was stuck downloading secondary codes meant to back up the original codes, but found that even those didn't work on our computers here at IGN. Then there was the selection. While there were a lot of recently released titles on the list, many big hits were missing completely, such as Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2, and Half-Life, and overall the complete cross-section of games were left with some pretty big holes. That goes with the code-cracker territory, however. What was more disappointing was the fact that even the working codes provided one, possibly two tweaks at the very most. Most GameShark console codes give you a few options for tweaking your game, but not so with GameShark PC. After a while, I began to wonder why I was feeling so worn out when the whole point of this was to save my lazy butt from having to beat games in the first place.  While it's logical that InterAct would want to branch into the PC realm with its GameShark range of products, the PC version feels more like an afterthought than a full implementation. Limited code selection, code implementation problems, and an interface that leaves a lot to be desired should keep you away from this code-cracker, and searching the back alleys of the web for free hacks and codes instead.
