The shareware PC game took off like a rocket and found itself on PCs everywhere. That was 1993. It's now 2006, 13 years later, and Doom just has been released for the skur-billionth time, only now on Xbox Live Arcade.What does this mean for you? For one, it's moderately priced at $10. If you already didn't buy Doom 3 of Xbox (which had Doom 1 and Doom 2 bundled with it) or swipe it illegally off some mime site. Thus, the only reasons to even think about buying Doom are for its split screen co-op and multiplayer modes, and of course, the 200 achievement points. Is it worth it?The devilish gore and monster closets of yesteryear are back! I'll say yes -- with some caveats. The original Doom hasn't held up for years from a graphics standpoint. It's the quintessential example of the super old, pixilated, sprite-based days of yor. It looks freakin' old, man. But hey, compared to some of the really freakin' old poop on Xbox Live Arcade, it actually looks dang good (for a really old pixilated game, that is). But I don't care so much about the graphics on this one, because in a sense, Doom represented the best graphics in its day and to me, watching this game play is like reveling in the rich dialog of a B movie with friends. Yeah, the dialog sucks, but it's so bad it's good. With Doom, even though the textures are ~up-resed~ (Microsoft loves to use this term for taking old graphics and making them ~high-res~), they still look old. But I'm belaboring the point.The real important question here is does the game hold up? When playing in the single-player campaign, the framerate just blazes. It's super fast. The framerate is even fast in two- to four-player split-screen offline; and even in two-player co-op offline it's smoking fast. But with four players on Xbox Live (online) things get a little haywire. All Xbox Live games depend to a certain degree on the speed your opponents' connections. I played with three guys with moderate connections, while mine was at full capacity, and the game was like watching Doom in slow motion. The stuttering was enough to step back and revel in it with a little bit of awe. Is this game really running that slow on my modern Xbox 360? Yes, Bucko. It really is.Pick off or online and play with up to four players in Deathmatch or cooperatively. In multiplayer on Xbox Live, the framerate slows down and hangs right at that point where it's no longer just a graphic splinter in your eye. It affects gameplay. Enemies normally skip across the ground, due to some really old animations, but now they not only skate, they time-warp from spot to spot. This affects your ability to aim with any sort of reasonable precision. You could win or lose a heated deathmatch based not on skill -- because it's almost impossible to predict lag -- but on luck; or rather, the lack of luck. My best recommendation is to avoid playing ranked games altogether unless your opponent has a top of the line connection (which you can see in the lobby, thankfully). The painful lag doesn't totally ruin the MP game. In fact, I had a blast playing. Doom is one of my all-time favorite games, and I was playing it religiously in 1994 and 1995. With all XBLA games, you have to build in the notion that you're playing a really old game. Just beware, the lag is there, waiting to slow your ass down.The cooperative option is impressive. You can play it offline with another a second player through the entire game. You can also play on Xbox Live. In fact, you can play it with a total of four players cooperatively off or online. Co-op involves friendly fire, but there is enough ammo and health around that you shouldn't have a problem. This is the kind of online XBLA game we've been waiting for. It packs great online capabilities for both cooperative and multiplayer games.Frag someone online today. You'll feel GREAT! Doom packs a mixture of options. You can play through the full original game in five difficulty levels (I'm too young to die! Hey, Not too rough!, Hurt me Plenty!, Ultra-Violence, and Nightmare) just like the original, and the hilarious old HUD with the changing animation of your marine's face returns with as much sick humor in the original. The game doesn't support a wide screen option (though you can cheat by stretching it to get a wider view). And you can't change the shooting option at all; there is just one controller setting. Doom naturally supports some nicely placed Achievements (some easy, some medium, and a few hard ones), leaderboards for both single-player and multiplayer gamers, and it offers voice support. For multiplayer games, you can pick frag and time limits, levels and player numbers. Online you can pick quickmatch, custom match, create-a-match, and check the leaderboards. There is only one MP game type, Deathmatch, but you can vie as a ranked or an unranked player, and there is a choice to pick a public or private games so you can invite friends only.The sound still holds up beautifully. The range of sound effects is just awesome: there are blissful fireballs that hiss past your head; snarling imps waiting to scratch your skin off, groaning zombie soldiers, bull-headed demons that road in your face, and more. The music is simple. It oozes with fear, anxiety and old horribly compressed technology. It's old but great. Nerve Software (which ported it over) even added a few extra little notes here and there, including a few sound effects I've never heard before.", "date": "Oct 4, 2006"}
