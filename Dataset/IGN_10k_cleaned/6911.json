Reasons vary depending on the title, but it's usually a matter of time. Specifically, developers simply don't have enough of it to make a quality product. Videogames based on movies need to hit the marketplace around the same time as the films themselves, so gamers usually wind up with rushed software.  Even when movie-based titles have an intriguing premise, or even promising design, sloppy execution usually stifles any fun. Sadly, that's the case with The Da Vinci Code, based off the best-selling novel by Dan Brown. It borrows a riveting story of conspiracy and murder, yet gets bogged down by sloppy gameplay. It even has a few interesting mechanics here and there, but these feel underdeveloped and haphazardly thrown in, too.    Now, before going any further, just know there's a good reason why this game even exists. And it has to do with money. Lots and lots of money. The book and film made a ton of it. So, naturally, the need to keep things moving required the property to expand into the game market. To go even further, the reason why the book and movie made tons of cash is because they both told a good story -- a tale of murder, conspiracy, killer monks and 2,000 year-old-secrets about Jesus Christ.   Just like in the movie, the game follows two characters, symbologist Robert Langdon and police cryptologist Sophie Neveu. You control them both, though not at the same time. Each behaves exactly the same in terms of combat and puzzle-solving abilities, and the game decides which one you control at any given time. The selection tries to coincide with the happenings of the book and movie, but it's not always spot-on. And while having two characters never hurt, it's mainly cosmetic here. It would have freshened things up a bit to have each character claim his/her own strengths.    You spend most of the game navigating museums, tombs and other environments in the third-person, fighting cops and solving puzzles as you go. The deeper you get, the more of the Da Vinci mystery you unravel. And while the story and overarching riddle do entertain, the actual gameplay needs serious work. First, the combat engine simply doesn't belong anywhere in this game. The book deals with an intellectual struggle, not a physical one. Well, not so much that you need to brawl with dozens of killer monks, anyway.   Combat splits into two phases. The first one plays like any other third-person brawler, in that you can walk up to an enemy and start beating them by mashing on the face buttons. You do this until the game switches to phase two, which it does automatically. Here, you win or lose the encounter depending on how you play a mini-game. It's pretty basic, all you need to do is hit the right sequence of buttons before the timer runs out to pummel foes into oblivion. You're also given a choice at the bottom of the screen to throw enemies, which takes a simple button press. When the above system works, it's fine. A little dull, by fine and it doesn't bog the experience by any means.        When it doesn't work, things go from dull and serviceable to broken and infuriating. For some cosmic reason, developers made the combat engine for one-on-one encounters, yet you continually face more than one person at a time. To finish the aforementioned mini-game sequences correctly, for instance, you need to push the right buttons in order, without interruptions. Only you get interrupted all the time in this game. Many encounters go far longer than intended -- all while you lose precious health.  Making matters worse, the actual brawl mechanics feel clunky. There's almost nothing you can do from a defensive standpoint, so taking damage is entirely unavoidable. Most of the time, you simply stand in front of an enemy and take turns beating each other. No, this isn't a standard action game, but if you're going to include combat there needs to be a way for players to defend themselves. You can pick up poles and golf clubs as weapons, but it doesn't make fighting deranged religious folk any more exciting.    Puzzle solving fares a little better. Good thing, since that's what you spend most of the time doing. A huge portion of the story deals with ancient codes and ciphers, so it's no surprise most of the puzzles do as well. Many of them have you jotting down numbers and symbols and rearranging them to uncover messages, clues and the like. One such puzzle, which you encounter early on, has you decrypting ancient symbols hidden in the Mona Lisa. Taking what you learn from this puzzle, you then head off to another section of the building (the Louvre) to decipher another riddle hidden in another set of paintings.  When not cracking codes, you'll gather an array of items for your inventory to solve other ~real-world~ enigmas, such as how to open a gate or door, or how to evade the cops. Most of these don't take much cerebral fortitude, though. For instance, whenever you need to combine items you'll rarely have more than a handful, so it's almost always clear as to what items go together. Thankfully, the game doesn't feature too much backtracking, as puzzles and their requisite items are usually located nearby. Convenience aside, these puzzles simply aren't that engaging.   Here's a quick example, set early in the game so as to not spoil anything: in order to get rid of a GPS transmitter you find in your jacket, you attach it to a bar of soap from a bathroom and chuck it out the window. Two items and almost no thought involved. And that's how things go for most of the game. At times, it feels like a genuine old-fashioned adventure game. But these moments don't last long. And it's not because the puzzles don't offer any fun, because they do, it's just that none of them really soar. Most come off as either too simple, or worse, too obscure. Most fall under the easy category, though, so the game won't take all that long to complete.  Unfortunately, the game's presentation doesn't do much to save it. Character models don't animate very well, though it's no so bad as to cause retinal bleeding. Textures could be a little sharper as well. Some of the environments do offer a nice bit of detail, though, but these instances only pop up from time to time. The soundtrack is much better. It's fitting -- moody, atmospheric and decidedly creepy. It's the right kind of music for slow-paced puzzle solving. But again, there's not much of it.  As a videogame, The Da Vinci Code captures a fraction of the intrigue from the best-selling novel. It weaves an interesting tale of conspiracy and corruption, but the gameplay simply doesn't back it up. It doesn't offer enough puzzle variety for serious adventure fans, and the combat will irritate or bore most action aficionados. Sure, a few of the puzzles work well, but in the end it just doesn't amount to much.", "date": "May 24, 2006"}
