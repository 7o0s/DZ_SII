Like its Hollywood cousins, GRAW is the proud recipient of a BAFTA award, scooping gongs for Technical Achievement and Game at last year's ceremony. The sequel has a lot to live up to then, not just because the first game was both a critical and commercial success, but also because it's been turned around in 12 months - something only sports games and by-the-numbers reiterations usually achieve.   With that in mind, let's start by getting one thing straight - despite being called Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, we'd say GRAW 1.5 is nearer to the mark. Rather than serving up a totally revamped gaming experience, GRAW 2 offers more of the same tactical action and many of the battle settings and set-pieces are almost carbon copies of those from the first game. That's by no means a bad thing - the original deserves all the critical praise it received - but if you're expecting something a little different, something more substantial than an annual makeover, you might be sorely disappointed. If, however, you want more of the same fine-tuned gameplay and refined strategic combat, GRAW 2 delivers, and then some.    Having saved the US president and crippled a terrorist ring in deepest Mexico at the end of GRAW, Captain Mitchell is called back from R&R after intel detects a surge in rebel activity on the Mexican border. Angry at losing their leader to the US, the terrorists are planning a revenge attack and are threatening a nuclear strike at America's heartland. The Ghosts, led by Mitchell, have just 72 hours to prevent the nuke from launching.   Seasoned GRAW veterans will want to skip the tutorial, although it's worth playing through because you're awarded Achievement points if you complete each task without mistake. Secondly, it introduces players to the all-new Cross Com 2.0. Well, the enhanced Cross Com, because it does pretty much the same as before, only better. For example, send a drone behind enemy lines and, when you order it to close in and scan for enemy troops, you're treated to a real-time bird's-eye view of the battlefield rather than trying to follow the action on the tactical map.   Similarly, you can now view skirmishes through the eyes of allied units simply by holding the right bumper. This gives players greater control over the position of friendly units, enabling them to direct troops into cover and target specific enemy units even if the commanding officer is on the opposite side of the battlefield. It's extremely useful when you're backed up by aerial units like the Little Bird assault helicopter, because you can send the helicopter to scout out the battlefield in front and then, while it's hovering over the enemy, switch to first-person mode to pinpoint enemies hiding behind cover or take out any armoured units before you send in the troops. Admittedly it was possible to do most of this using the original GRAW's Cross Com, but now you've got much greater control.     Commanding multiple units is also much easier and quicker, plus there's more variety in the types of Allied units you're supported by. The Mule, an unmanned armoured car, is indispensable on the battlefield, providing ammo top-ups and health kits on the move. It's also a great way of closing in on your target without getting shot to ribbons, using its thick armour plating as cover as it trundles across the desert.    Many of the original vehicles return too, including the Stalker APC, M1-A1 tank, helicopters and, of course, the UAV drone. You're also backed up by additional infantry and, at one point in the game, must direct a squad of Marines alongside your Ghosts, while using the drone to scope out enemy threats. The interaction between units is much more seamless compared to the first GRAW and you really do need to use units together to get through the game. Learning the strengths and weaknesses of friendly units is essential, because if you send in a tank to take a squad of troops, they'll easily evade its big guns, outflanking the slow-moving behemoth before taking it out with an RPG. Likewise, light armoured vehicles equipped with high-calibre machineguns will make light work of your helicopters but won't last more than a few seconds against a high-explosive tank round.     There are times when Mitchell must go it alone and in that respect GRAW 2's single-player campaign is superbly paced. Subtlety is required to finish some missions, sticking to cover and only attacking the enemy when a kill is guaranteed. At other times an all-out assault is the only way forward, using the combined might of your forces to cripple the enemy.   Mission objectives are refreshingly diverse, forcing players to use every last bit of their arsenal. True, you'll spend most of the time gunning down patrols with a machinegun, but there's also plenty of scope (baddum-tish) for sniping enemy marksmen and blowing up hostile tanks. There are more set-piece battles too, like when Mitchell is pinned inside a building by a pair of enemy helicopters, or when his Hummer is ambushed and he's forced to finish the mission alone, without any of his high-tech gear. It's gripping stuff and offers a more balanced, rounded gaming experience compared to the first GRAW.    For all its intense pacing and epic scripting, there's no escaping the fact that GRAW 2's campaign game is short. In fact we waded through the entire solo game on the default difficulty in around eight hours and that's including the tutorial missions. We'd be lying if we said we weren't disappointed with how quickly we finished the game, but then it's no different to Gears of War. Arguably it's more varied too, and certainly every bit as exciting.   Also, what the campaign mode lacks in length, GRAW 2 certainly makes up for in multiplayer, and not just over Xbox Live. Up to four players can compete against each other or play cooperatively on a single machine, across a wide variety of maps and mission objectives.   However, take GRAW 2 online and it really excels. The number of game modes has been bumped up, with every kind of match - all-against-all, team battle, co-op, territory control, objective, elimination - all catered for. Having spilt blood on the battlefield in many a 16-player deathmatch we can safely say GRAW 2 is a noticeable improvement over the original, even if the multiplayer isn't quite as tactical as the single-player game - you can't duck out from behind cover, for example. Still, that was always the case in the first GRAW and there's still much more to it than mindlessly legging it around, guns blazing.    It's the co-op campaign that really shines though. For starters, the missions are totally separate from the one-player game, so there's plenty to enjoy even if you've sailed through the game on your own. Secondly, the co-op campaign mixes the strategic gameplay of the single-player game with the more intense gunplay of the deathmatch mode and the result is a mode that'll appeal to both hardcore GRAW vets and more casual shooter fans.If Rainbow Six Vegas raised the tactical shooter bar originally set by GRAW last year then this sequel pushes it even higher. Despite the relatively short single-player game, its a much better all-round package, boasting a wonderfully epic campaign thats supported by a fully fleshed-out multiplayer experience. Although it doesnt push the series forward in great leaps and bounds, the refinements that have been made  the improved Cross Com, meatier multiplayer and more diverse campaign objectives  really do shine and only the stunted single-player game stops it from scoring higher.", "date": "Mar 7, 2007"}
