The GBA market isn't exactly the most profitable area to be in for game developers, so it makes business sense for the publishers and developers to cut corners to save costs and increase revenue...after all, if they didn't make money, they wouldn't make the games. Unfortunately for gamers, that means a virtual deja vu if they purchase the game a second time in hopes they're going to get a brand new title...and if you've already shelled out the thirty bucks the first time, doing it again doesn't seem exactly fair if there's not a significant amount added to the gaming experience. All-Star Baseball 2004 is very close to the baseball game the company released for the Game Boy Advance last spring. The 2003 edition was actually one of the better baseball titles released on the Game Boy Advance, so it makes sense for the developers to use last year's game as a foundation for a new, updated edition. But even though the 2004 edition has some minor tweaks here and a couple of changes there, essentially it's just a better tasting version of last year's game...in a new wrapper. Features All Major League teams and players Exhibition, Season, All-Star, Home Run Derby Full Season tracking (cartridge save) Link cable support for two players  Collectable trading cards (trade via GBA and GameCube) Only for Game Boy Advance  At its core, All-Star Baseball 2004 features all of what went into the previous All-Star Baseball 2003 GBA project. It features the same elements that made it a quality baseball product: the multiple gameplay modes, its intuitive batting interface, its fluid 3D-style fielding engine, collectible trading cards, statistics tracking to the game cartridge, and link cable two player modes. Although it still suffers that GBA problem of offering all team's home stadiums as backgrounds, but once the ball gets into the outfield its the same single generic field. As a baseball game, Acclaim's GBA title has all the necessary bells and whistles to keep fans of the sport happy.   Last year's game wasn't perfect, as it had elements that kept it out of the big leagues. The previous game's sound engine was the absolute pits, and it's obvious that most of the development time went into putting a better audio environment into All-Star Baseball 2004. The incidental and in-between inning music is much better and ear-pleasing this time around, and the development team even threw in a bit more audio commentary from the play-by-play guy, Rob Williams. The sound samples between calls are a bit spotty, though, with brief announcements of where the ball's heading after a hit, or what type of pitch was thrown. And the commentary's obviously pieced together with smaller files strung together, with awkward pauses between samples. It's about as versatile as that classic attempt in the original Genesis title Sports Talk Baseball, but at least the Acclaim team made the attempt to put in what console gamers have been taking for granted for years now.  The gameplay received a necessary tweak from last year's title, which is a good thing since there were some pretty wonky player and AI behavior going on in 2003, like outfielders spazzing out during a flyball, or tag-out issues that wouldn't register during the play. Most of the issues from last year's game has been cleared up, though there are occasional situations popping up, like a quick double-play attempt to second and first not registering the tag out at second. The pitching interface has also been tweaked a bit, with an on-screen indicator that shows players their pitcher's stamina during their time up on the mound.  But what wasn't smoothed out from last year is the outfield camera; it still follows the ball at the center of the screen instead of focusing on the players. When an fly ball is sent to the outfield, players generally want to see the closest outfielders in order to line them up with the descending ball; but the way this game handles it, players won't see their fielders during a flyball until the ball's pretty much on the ground. It's difficult to catch easy flyballs because of this scrolling camera focus, and it should have been cleaned up for 2004. The fielding camera aside, All-Star Baseball 2004 is a solid baseball game. It's just a spit-polish difference from last year's game, but the clean-up makes it a better playing baseball title. Just don't expect a significantly different gaming experience from last year's version.", "date": "Mar 4, 2003"}
