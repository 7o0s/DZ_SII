We are huge fans of the Rush franchise. SF Rush 2 and Rush 2049 on the Dreamcast were top notch titles. Those games not only had an excellent sense of speed, but also an unsurpassed amount of intricate shortcuts and secret paths. Racing across rooftops while struggling to secure those omnipresent Mountain Dew cans was a total thrill. Add to that a Stunt Mode that to this day is still unrivaled in its awesomeness, and you have a winning combination.   As we popped Rush into the office PSP, we had memories of its incredible forbears bouncing through our heads. Those of you out there pining for a game to compete with those classic racers had best look elsewhere. While Rush for the PSP borrows its name from the Rush franchise, that is where the similarities end. Aside from the occasional side-street or jump, this game bears absolutely no resemblance to Rush games of yore. Instead, the game replicates the more recent LA Rush in story and style. What is left is a hip-hop-infused racer with sprawling, open-ended environments and absolutely no fun whatsoever.   Rush the Rap  For this latest Rush game, Midway has seen fit to jump on the Grand Theft Auto bandwagon and insert a hip-hop flavored story into the game. Rush for the PSP tells the story of a humble underground street racer, who has all of his hard earned cars stolen from him by a rival bad-ass, Lydell. The story serves merely as a poorly thrown together excuse as to why you find yourself racing so much in the game. Instead of merely racing for the love of it, your character is racing to win back his honor, his cars, and Lydell's woman. Never mind the rampant misogyny and excessive swearing, the story in this game is bad all on its own merits, and is constantly forced upon the player at every turn. Players will often find themselves forced into sitting through some horribly contrived story sequence before they can actually engage in the game's races (which are not all that fun to begin with).     Following in the footsteps of several other series, Midway has changed the formula of the Rush games by creating an open-ended world for gamers to race in. Rather than having a linear Grand Prix Mode, gamers must traverse the recreation of Los Angeles in an attempt to discover the next hidden race. This serves no actual gameplay purpose, other than artificially lengthening the game by forcing players to drive around looking for their next challenge. Unlike in the Grand Theft Auto games, the world of Rush does not feel at all connected to reality. There are no pedestrians, and the physics when crashing into random cars are horrendously unrealistic.    The game's physics serve to make pretty much every race lose any semblance of intensity that they might have had otherwise. Crashing into cars and objects causes visible damage to your car, but this is not reflected in the gameplay in any way. Your car will still run just as well when it is in pristine condition, as when it is completely falling apart. Furthermore, other cars seem to lack any weight whatsoever. Running in to them will do nothing more than shove the other car out of the way and slow down your car for a brief instant.   Also featured in the game is the ubiquitous ~Wanted Meter,~ measuring the level of police interest in your activities. Unlike in other, better games, this meter serves little to no purpose in Rush, as police can easily be evaded regardless of how high the meter is. The greatest thing about the police in Rush is that, once players are pulled over, the only punishment is a fine of miniscule proportions. Even when pulled over in the midst of a race, players will find that they lose almost no time whatsoever, as the fine is instantly deducted and they are sent on their way.    Easy as Racing Fish in a Barrel  This brings us to the next major complaint that we have about the game, and that is its difficulty. This game is far too forgiving for it to be any fun. We understand that Midway was attempting to make it accessible, but taking out any and all challenge can leave the player feeling cheated. It is possible to hit every single obstacle in a race and still come out several seconds ahead of your competitors.    The game's story expects players to believe that they are hard pressed to recover from the loss of all of their worldly possessions at the hands of the malevolent Lydell. However, this can hardly be the case, considering how indescribably easy it is to win any challenge thrown your way. The toughest of the game's races will take no more than three tries to beat, even for the worst of players.   When a racing game is as easy as Rush is, there is little to no incentive to progress through the story mode. The difficulty never really ramps up, making every race feel almost exactly the same as the one directly preceding it. In fact, were it not for the constant interruption of having to drive halfway across LA in between each race, it would be nearly impossible to be sure that you aren't just doing the same race over and over again.   Midway has attempted to change things up a little, by having a few different mission types; unfortunately, they feature the same utter lack of variety between the individual races that plagues the rest of the game.   Bling-Bland  In an effort to appeal to the same racing enthusiasts that games like Need For Speed Underground have successfully targeted in the past, Midway has included several different vehicles in the game. This seems like a fun idea on the surface, however it is implemented so poorly in Rush that it ends up being more of an annoyance than anything else. Unlocking new cars is done merely by completing races at predetermined points in the game. Periodically, you will find yourself in control of an entirely new car, racing back towards your hidden villa with black SUVs in hot pursuit. If these missions didn't suffer from the same difficulty problems of every other mission in the game, they might actually be sort of exciting.    As it stands, they seem to have no bearing on the gameplay whatsoever, as the difference in the cars you unlock is fairly negligible. Furthermore, once you get a new car to drive, you are stuck using it until the next recovery mission comes along. Sometimes this forces you into ~upgrading~ your car into something worse than the car you already had. Again, none of this really matters, since people could stab forks into their eyes before playing this game, and still come away largely victorious.    Tony Hawk With a Motor?  One of the biggest draws of the earlier Rush games was the awesomely fun Stunt Mode. It seems like Midway was listening to its fans when it conceived of this game, because it added this mode into the PSP version, something noticeably absent from LA Rush on the consoles. Unfortunately for us all, the Stunt Mode in Rush has little to do with the Stunt Modes we knew and loved in the past. Players can jump off of ramps and spin their cars around in crazy ways, but they can't do so with any of the precision of earlier games in the series.    Like in Rush 2049, players can apply outside torque onto their cars after they leap into the air; however, unlike that game, everything done before and after hitting a jump is worthless. In previous Rush titles, hitting a jump at a certain angle would cause your car to fly further and flip more speedily, making a large part of the skill focused on hitting jumps in perfect ways. Furthermore, different types of landings resulted in different allotments of points. Of course, this is another feature lacking in Rush for the PSP. Ultimately, the Stunt Mode is a mere shadow of what it once was and what it could be.   Looking Pretty Good  Graphically, this game is a mixed bag. While on the surface, everything looks fairly good, it does not feature all of the bells and whistles that its competitors do. The anti-aliasing in Rush is noticeably missing, and there is quite a lot of tearing on the ground textures. Similarly, the particle effects are lacking in pretty much every instance, making for some rather lackluster racing situations.   At the same time, the cars are well modeled and show off some beautiful reflections. The game's framerate is totally solid, adding to the overall sense of speed. The game has a pretty nice draw distance, allowing you to see all the way across Los Angeles, however, everything is so ugly looking (possibly in an attempt at verisimilitude), that it really doesn't matter how far you can see. Also, there is some pretty nice car deformation of your cars whenever you get into a scrape. However, this does not carry over to the computer controlled cars, which do not show any noticeable changes, no matter how hard you crash into them.   The biggest technical gripe we had with the game was the prevalence of load times. There were incredibly long load times before each and every cut scene as well as preceding every race. Sometimes this would result in a 40 second break in the gameplay before we were permitted to go into the races we had just selected. If we weren't getting paid to play the game, this would have largely been a deal breaker, causing us to often walk away from the game in disgust.  We went into this game expecting to relive the fun we had with Midway's earlier Rush titles on the Dreamcast and arcade machines. Instead we were greeted with a game that attempted too much, and ended up doing nothing particularly well. The open-ended world felt entirely tacked on and unnecessary, and the inclusion of classic modes was little more than a poorly veiled concession to fans of the older games. The hip-hop flavor of the game could not have been more annoying had they tried, as the cut scenes were forced and derivative, and the voice acting was nothing if not mediocre.", "date": "Nov 30, 2006"}
