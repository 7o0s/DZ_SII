Theaters are about the dim the house lights for ~Friday Night Lights,~ Monday Night Football is filling the tube when you're not playing ESPN NFL 2K5, and several gridiron sims are jockeying for top spot on your handset. The latest pigskinner to hit the decks is Sorrent's FOX Sports Football '05, the new update to the franchise that really introduced football to cellphones.   Features:   Offensive & defensive playbooks  Season & Exhibition play  Create-a-Team option   Sorrent has some stiff competition this season. Gamers have been able to download JAMDAT's excellent NFL 2005 for weeks, and THQ Wireless just released the very good NFL Football 2005. Both of those games try to introduce console-style football to handsets, but with plenty of sim trimmings for the hardcore fans. FOX Sports Football '05 sticks with pure, arcade football. Sure, there's always some strategy involved, but this game isn't nearly as meaty as the other two, especially JAMDAT's product.   FOX Sports Football '05 does not have an official NFL license. As a result, teams are only known by their city, and there are no real-life athletes in the title. This isn't a big deal to casual players, as everybody knows if you pick Minnesota, you're playing as the Vikings. But for some gamers, a full license is essential. If no license is a deal-breaker, then perhaps you should check into THQ Wireless' game.   But enough with the comparisons.   FOX Sports Football '05 is a fast-moving, arcade-style game of football where you spend far less time with your nose in the playbook than on the field. Snaps happen fast and plays even faster. In fact, the game even offers a speed boost (one per down) so you can really juice your way up the field and get a head of steam before performing a dive tackle.   Without a bunch of heavy-duty sim stuff to get through, FOX Sports Football '05 is kind of a breezy football experience. And in some respects, that's pretty cool. You can plow through a game in about ten minutes, provided you don't just pour over the playbook. The plays happen fast and the amount of time getting in and out of said play is short.   A lot of this is credited to the control, which is pretty easy to master. Use the OK button to start a play. If you have the ball, you then either make a break for it, or use the number keys to pass to specific players (as noted in the playbook screens). On defense, you can use the same speed boost to drive the QB into the dirt so the opposition loses yards. You can also dive for both the goal line or for yards, or dive tackle into the ball carrier.   While playing, the feature we appreciated most was the callouts for passing recipients. In the corners of the screen, small boxes show the paths of your receivers and a small circle denotes where they are on that path. This is especially useful during heated plays, as it allows you to wait until the absolute last second before throwing a pass and risking an interception.   However, the speed and ease of play means FOX Sports Football '05 isn't the deepest game on the market. This heralded game of inches turns into something akin to Blitz without all of the bone-crushing violence. Teams have been downsized to only seven players. So much of the game is spent just moving back and forth quickly, picking up and losing yards. At no point does it really feel like a war, just a skirmish.   FOX Sports Football '05 employs a decent Create-a-Team mode where players can choose uniform colors and assign stat points across categories like Passing and Rushing.   Presentation-wise, FOX Sports Football '05 is something of a disappointment. The playbook screens lack any panache; they're just sorta there. However, they are clean and precise, and there's certainly something to be said for presentating only the essnetial information in an easy-to-read format.   The animation itself moves smoothly, but the player models are not especially detailed. The player models are decently sized, though, thanks to the smaller teams -- and very few times you lose track of your men. The audio is decent, with some whistles and play-related sounds. The game lifts the opening theme from the televised FOX Sports Football broadcasts.Personally, I cannot help but be just a little let down by FOX Sports Football '05. Sorrent owned this game at one time, back when mobile football was just a twinkle in the publisher's eye. But the rest of the mobile world has caught up, and in the case of FOX Sports Football '05, it has surpassed it in a few respects. Presentation is somewhat behind the competition and no NFL license for the hardcore fans. However, the simplicity of the controls is good and the speed of play is appropriate for an arcade-style wireless game designed to really only be played in several minute bursts. However, this means the game lacks a certain amount of depth. So, really, it's your call: Do you want something closer to a sim experience for your handset? Or is a satisfying arcade experience more your bag? If it's the latter, you will be well served by Sorrent.In the end, though, I believe Sorrent would be wise to study the other developer's playbooks for FOX Sports Football '06 inspirado. After all, Sony's GameDay may have taken the ball from Madden for a little while, but we all know how that Cinderella story ended.With so many players now competiting in the sports arena, next year's batch of football games promises to be a real war.", "date": "Sep 21, 2004"}
