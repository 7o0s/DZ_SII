Subtle, fast, sliding, narrowly passing another, whatever the case may be, NASCAR cars have created a hefty entertainment business, drawing top racers and millions of fans to watch the greatest left turns ever on a weekly basis.    After its respectable, initial NASCAR endeavor on PlayStation 2 (NASCAR Heat 2002) Infogrames and Monster Games have returned to the drawing board to explore newer aspects of the NASCAR experience with NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona. With a strong bend toward simulation, technical precision and a hardcore NASCAR experience, Monster Games has cobbled together a deeper, more lively (if slightly hokey) game deep with new cars, races, special challenges, advice from top pro drivers, and galvanized the entire experience into one wildly thorough racing game. If it's true-to-life NASCAR you want, this is the real deal.   The FactsDeep Career Mode offers up the full spectrum of rookie dirt NASCAR all the way to the Winston Cup  Multiple game modes: Career, Season, Single Race, Beat the Heat, Pro Trainer, and Head-to-Head  Features NASCAR Craftsman Truck series  A 43 car field for Winston Cup races  Hugely modifiable cars with over 100 parts  Manage a race team by balancing team skills and a budget  Career statistics track progress with extensive detail  Compete for multiple championships in a single season  31 tracks including dirt  Pro Trainer includes over 20 minutes of video instructions from top NASCAR drivers  Tuned damage model represents the destruction of a 20-care pileup right down to the effects of tire rubbing  Progressive scan support  Widescreen support  Surround sound support  Gameplay  The most important aspects of any NASCAR game are its ability to deliver an accurate and detailed re-creation of the world of NASCAR. This nefarious task includes getting the licenses of all the pro teams, drivers, their sponsors, and re-creating all of the tracks in the most accurate fashion. And most importantly, a developer must deliver driving, physics and control systems that feel right, that control well and which, in the end, enable players to grow in driving skill and ability. Monster Games has done all of these things after its own style and fashion, and all with an eye for detail. Leaning more toward simulation than arcade racer, Monster Games' title features hundreds of modifications and tuning aspects than most other NASCAR games, but it still walks a fine line in the driving department, giving players some videogame leeway during races.   Surprisingly, a huge amount of detail has been poured into Dirt to Daytona. The track list is particularly extensive. There are seven dirt tracks, five modified tracks and 20 NASCAR tracks, including Daytona International Speedway, Bristol Motor Speedway, Anoka Raceway, Welch Valley Racing Complex, and Talladega Superspeedway (just to name a few). Some of the new tracks include Eagan Speedbowl (a 1/2-mile bowl and 12-degree banks), the Welch Valley Raving Complex (a 2.22-mile road course for modified series), and the Kansas Speedway (1.5-mile speedway with 15-degree banks).     The newest Truck, Modified, Dirt additions are an interesting tack, since they're derived from the lesser known NASCAR races yet they're still very much a part of the racing culture, not to mention they make for quite a good videogame progression scheme. While players can instantly get to grips with four races (Cup, Truck, Modified, Dirt) in Single Race, Career and Beat the Heat modes offer players the real meat and potatoes. Players create a character (including basics such as name, hometown, age) and get started in the roughest, earliest kinds of racing: NASCAR dirt racing. Using a standard stock car, the mode starts off with rookie drivers. They vie in races to earn sponsors and money so they can upgrade and thus improve their cars. Modeling its interface after the likes of World of Outlaws: Sprint Cars, Dirt to Daytona sets up an office, desk, paperwork and a calendar for players to toggle through to handle their racing careers. The menu is set up well, and players essentially have unlimited time to fiddle with their cars and race, which follows a linear pattern.   During these events, players have oodles of options at their fingertips. In fact, along with the interesting car additions, the modification roster is perhaps its most impressive aspect. Getting right into the nitty-gritty of things before a race, gamers can tinker with the weight, shocks, springs, tires, camber, gears and other miscellaneous things to optimize their car for that particular track. The game permits precision adjustments, too, such as air tire PSI, adjusting the weight of the bumpers and springs, and fiddling with the gears themselves. The menus are relatively quick and most of the adjustments are self-explanatory.    After winning enough money, important upgradeable parts can be purchased to improve the car's performance more permanently. Handfuls of upgrades can be made from the garage and by looking up the parts catalogue to improve the engine, aerodynamics, suspension and exhaust aspects. Each race style (Truck, Modified, Dirt, Cup) offers different parts, specific to that style of racing, and each part is rated. So your engine is measured by power, peak torque, redline and weight specifications, while the suspension measures front and rear grip, weight and durability, posting your current specs against the new purchase so you can see the differences. High-tech graphs indicate their exact performance. There are hundreds more details to provide in this section, but the point is Monster Games is serious about its parts, and NASCAR gamers looking for the finer details will find them here.   The new cars are a mixed lot, sometimes fun but other times frustrating. Driving a stock dirt car, hitting max speeds of 68 mph round and round again isn't all that much fun -- and it's pretty slow. It's a far cry from hitting 200 mps in a spiffed out Cup car. But it's part of the long process of getting to the Cup cars. The trucks and modified cars are also a kick to drive. They all handle differently and players will need to master the skills of each car, accumulating skills from the previous race style into their next season using a different kind of car. For the slidiest kinds of races, any of the dirt races works well. But for the fastest ride, the Cup is your best bet.     Each of the four car types handle well, and of course, the feel of each is based on the car's own specs, but it also fluctuates depending on the style of track, be it dirt, mud or tarmac. The cars respond quickly to the touch, be it in analog or digital form, and spinouts, tail-swipes, and monster crashes are all part of the ride. In fact, these cars are all very sensitive, so much that it's quite easy to snag a patch of grass, another racer's fender and simply by touching the wall, there's a strong possibility of losing not only your rhythm, but your placement and the race. But the level of control while driving is there, enabling you to perform subtle turns, alterations and whatnot to drive that perfect line.    Given the 40-plus cars on screen in some races, the quality of pileup potential is great. They do happen on their own, and opponents do spin out, drop out, or crash on their own, but it happens seldom. You have to initiate that kind of action. Also, you'd be surprised as how much damage you car takes, even after heading straight into traffic, and how smart the AI is in trying to avoid you! Overall, the racing is well balanced and the AI is measured.   Perhaps more than any other factor in Dirt to Daytona affecting driving is drafting. Learning to powerslide and finding the best lines are also crucial to be sure, but using opponent cars for speed drifts is by far and away the best fashion of gaining speed and ultimately great placement. A nifty draft meter displays how much or how little you're getting, and you can feel and see your speed increasing. On the flip side of things, if you lose the pack, you're pretty much up a creek without a paddle. If you're interested in placing in the top five, but you incurred a bad start or a small wipeout, it's very difficult to catch up once you've lost the ability to drift.    Lastly, the game offers a different style of narration and education. Commentator Allen Bestwick offers TV-style commentator narration, which is neat at first. His appearance is very much a reminder of the early 32-bit era, though it works only slightly better. In other words, after listening to him one or twice, it becomes standard to skip over his presentation, even if it provides valid and necessary information. He's also hokey and reminds me of Casey Casum. Likewise, the Pro Trainer mode functions even less well. Giving you the inside track from top drivers, Monster Games presents video of drivers who tell you in a quick rap-up what to do and expect in that race. The problem is that they talk fast, use a vocabulary few non-hardcore fans would understand, and well, they don't tell you anything substantial enough that can't be learned from racing through the course a few times in practice wouldn't achieve. In other words, they're kind of useless, though a nice thought.   Graphics  Designed to give you the big picture while also providing the details, Monster Games' Dirt to Daytona offers a good, workmanlike visual experience. For instance, the racetrack is littered with details. The crowds are various and the stands and polygonal structures also change from race to race. The roads are textured with a great variety of color and patterning. Lucky spectators stand inside the track behind their SUVs and trucks watching the race, and loads of team trailers and all kinds of equipment fill in the rest. Nothing stands out as spectacular, but they're all solid, contextual details.   The cars themselves offer visual specification-precision, from the body, model, wheels and logos to the cockpits. By the way, the game offers a good set of camera angles and replay camera angles too. While driving, there's first-person, chassis, cockpit, hood, and two over-the-shoulder perspectives -- close and far. The latter of which is useful in some cases since there apparently are no rearview mirrors. The collision model is something pretty eye-opening too. Cars create a variety of differently looking kinds of smoke and dust. Cars lose parts, and they crumple with a decent amount of bending, falling, twisting metal.   Offering an excellent sense of speed, the framerate stays stable throughout, which shows off Monster's well-built engine given the amount of cars simultaneously on screen. Occasionally, you'll see little things, such as shadows looking blockier than in real life and the LOD line subtly popping bits and pieces of more refined texture into the screen, but nothing stands out as hurtful. There are less lighting and special effects going on here than other NASCAR games, but it still looks pretty good with some specular lighting and reflection mapping.    The GameCube version also supports progressive scan and widescreen -- a double bonus for HDTV owners.    Sound  Using a rock-country style theme song that captures a kind of Allman Brothers' vibe, Dirt to Daytona gets players riled up with variations on this theme. There isn't much else musically to mention, and while the theme is better than decent, it's not terribly diverse or interesting the 20th time around. There could be a whole extra level of musical quality that's just not been tapped in this game.   During the race, of course, players are treated to the sounds of the car engines, scraping metal, and your cockpit crew indicating whose coming close and who's slipping. With the right speakers or headphones one notices a great level of ambient sound, from generators to car engines to machinery. Monster Games offers a good sense of being there, sound wise.    Just for kicks, we spun around and headed straight into the oncoming pack of cars and my team told me with a strong sense of disgust we were headed in the wrong direction. It was comical. Additionally, the car engines give a real feel of power and acceleration. They accurately scale up and down the gears, providing that hard-to-catch sensation of sound equaling sensation. You can hear the click of the gears, the winding, screaming engine and various engine sounds that re-create a good sense of being in the cockpit and racing genuinely fast.   No Dolby Pro Logic II support.While leaning toward a sim-style of racing but still maintaining a good balance of forgiveness and hard-lined AI, Monster Games offers what is perhaps the most detailed, heavily modifiable NASCAR game on the market. The game handles beautifully, with instant responsiveness and loads of control while in the drivers seat. In the garage or in the seat of your career mode, Dirt to Daytona remains consistently capable of delivering a well presented game, replete with educational videos, explanations and training modes, and an intuitive progression scheme. If you like NASCAR, you'll love this game. If you like driving, you should give this a look, and if you like tinkering with cars in general, this is for you.", "date": "Nov 18, 2002"}
