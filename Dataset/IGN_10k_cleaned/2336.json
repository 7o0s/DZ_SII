After getting the chance to play the multiplayer beta along with everyone else on the Internet, we all quickly became horribly addicted and were salivating at a chance for some more action. When we got the chance to play a little of the single player action and a couple more of the multiplayer maps at an event for the game, it just reinforced our excitement. So when we finally went and got our hands on a copy of the game, I got the game handed to me and I tore the box open, peed on myself and rubbed the jewel case all over my body for a little while. After calming down a little bit and taking a shower, I finally got to sitting down long enough to play the game and found myself in a pretty solid single player game and an incredibly fun and horribly addicting multiplayer game.  The single player game is good. Not very good. But good. Anybody that has ever played an FPS and gotten through it won't have an incredibly tough time with this game. And that's part of the problem I suppose. There's nothing really new and exciting with the single player aspect of the game that makes it challenging or really all that interesting. There's a lot of tried and true level design and gameplay here without ever really taking a leap into new territory like No One Lives Forever did.  But one thing that can be said about this game is that its atmosphere is pretty darn good. First off the look of the game is really, really fantastic. The models are some of the best I've seen to date. The textures used on the models and all throughout the game are top notch. Lips move separate from the teeth behind them creating a nice lip-synching that isn't perfect but certainly adds to the effect. Animations are fluid and fun to watch for the most part, especially some of the idle animations that bring the soldiers to life. My roommate (who although she doesn't play games, does sit down and watch every now and again) was quite disturbed to see that a couple of guards that had been talking and strolling along about there own business were suddenly lying dead on the floor. ~That's so depressing,~ says Amy, ~there they were just talking and having a life two seconds ago and now they're gone...~ She only stopped crying after I convinced her that they were, in fact, just polygonal make-ups and not real people. Guess that just goes to show that the developers did a pretty good job.  The levels themselves were also very well done, although a little hit and miss for me. Maybe this was because I wanted to stay in the creepy halls of Castle Wolfenstein for the whole game where the moody feel to the textures and lighting really set you to go adventuring. After leaving the castle you'll get to a village (which was also outstanding by the way) and eventually some catacombs. The mood in these levels is also set well with some very nice level design but textures became much more commonplace. The point of Wolfenstein for me has always been the creepiness of the ultimate mad scientist hideout, but when you get into attacking hangars and regular environments, the game somehow loses the appeal it once had.   The sound added a bit with some eerie noises in some parts and the various sounds that go with bullets hitting different materials. Voice overs were pretty well done, even if the Germans did speak in English... not so sure why they did that. The dialogue that took place between some of the idle enemies really wasn't all that interesting in the first place, so why not put it in German to set the mood even more? I don't know... no more shouts of ~Ach mein leiber!~ to keep you company on your killing sprees. So much for nostalgia.  The story itself was moved along via engine cut-scenes, conversations between soldiers, and notepads holding little clues to the story lying around in the game that you can read. It's a decent storyline, although once again, it isn't anything you'll really be thinking about after you're done with the single player game. Unfortunately the cut-scenes are a little boring at times as they usually consist of a conversation at a desk without any real action. There are some that build the tension such as one that shows some Nazi soldiers freaking out about something and getting ready to be attacked. It's a good moment, but one that isn't really repeated very often.  It seems that nowadays in the FPS genre a lot of time is spent making the AI something special. And while it was mostly solid, there wasn't anything here that was outstanding. There were virtually no instances of the AI working as a team, and even when it did seem like they might be, it was suspect that the enemies just ended up dodging my shots in different directions causing them to surround me by accident. But there were no real efforts by the enemy to sneak around behind me to catch me by surprise. The AI was pretty good at trying to get away from my shots however. While they did tend to just run at me now and again, there were definitely some indications with the tougher enemies that they didn't like being shot. They would take cover and wait for me to do something stupid. And unfortunately there were also some times where the AI would just sit in a corner and not do a thing, or just not see me when I was pretty much in front of their faces. But those little quirks were very few and far between. But some aggressive and semi intelligent enemies made for some fun firefights.  But when it comes down to it, the single player game almost takes a back seat to the real strength of the title which is the multiplayer aspect developed by Nerve. It tastes a lot like crack. Very addictive. I was actually up until 3am last night battling it out on the net. The multiplayer aspect of the game takes objective based missions and bumps them up into an exciting fight that demands teams work together to be successful. And with a bajillion people playing online you might not even mind that you can't populate the servers with bots.  And they've balanced the various character classes so well that all of them are very important in determining how well teams will do in the game. There are 4 basic classes that are the same on Axis and Allies sides. First you have your basic soldier that can use any of the weapons available in the game (not all of the weapons from the single player mission are included for balancing issues) and comes with extra ammo. He'll be brute of the forces usually with flamethrower, sniper rifle, or Venom in hand. The engineer can place and defuse dynamite as well as repair turret guns, making him extremely valuable a very necessary for most of the multiplayer missions. My choice and one of the most seemingly underrated classes is the medic. When a player comes in the game in medic uniform, a grant of 10 extra health to each player is given. He also comes in with 125 health and the ability to regenerate constantly as well. And this is without even mentioning the fact that he can revive players from near death and hand out health packs making him everyone's best friend. Both the engineer and the medic are relagated to basic weapons and small ammo amounts, but that's where the lieutenant comes in. Any lieutenant in the game can hand out ammo packs to whomever needs them making both the medic and engineer good to go. He also is the only one with binoculars and the ability to call in air strikes on enemy positions making him an extreme tactical advantage.  The interface where you decide your character could be a little easier for switching characters before you respawn because sometimes you just can't switch before you're automatically dropped back in the game with whatever you previously were. Some sort of automatic set-up ala Tribes 2 would have been nice, but it isn't something that will kill your fun and I've heard that there is already someone with a macro that will allow you to do just this.  The actual interface when you are in a game is actually pretty damn helpful without being too much to handle. You'll of course see your normal stats like health and ammo, but will also be able to see your entire team's names and health in the upper right corner of the screen as well as where they are in the map. If you're a medic or a lieutenant having this information to see where you can do the most good is really nice. Whenever anyone calls for ammo or a medic, along with the text message that also tells what area the request is coming from, they'll also get a symbol above their head so medics and lieutenants can locate and administer help as soon as possible. There is also a compass in the bottom left corner that will help direct these characters to the needed spots if you get confused about your position.  The maps in multiplayer are mostly based off of levels from the single player game, with the exception of the beach map that everyone knows from the multiplayer beta test. I still have the most fun on that map, but the others certainly have their plusses as well. It's too bad they don't have original maps, but there is something neat about being able to have a battle in familiar locations from the single player game. The modified maps are well thought out for maximum strategic team play and leave little to be desired. There are only eight maps to begin with but we've already heard rumors that Nerve will be releasing more of the maps that they've already made over time. But don't worry, these few maps will keep you plenty occupied for quite a while. Some of them are pretty complex and the tactics players are using are already getting more creative.  So do I recommend getting this one? Yes. Yes I do. The single player campaign is certainly decent and will hold people's interest long enough to get them accustomed to the various weapons in time to jump into multiplayer. It's not quite the revolutionary trip back to Castle Wolfenstein that people may have been hoping for, but that's no reason to discount it, as it is nothing less than a solid and satisfying experience. But it's no doubt that the real value in the title falls on the multiplayer which is definitely one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had in quite a while. It all adds up to a really fun game that fans of the genre will love to get a piece of.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
