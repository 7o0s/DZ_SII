{"name": "RC de GO!", "name_review": "RC de Go!", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/10/rc-de-go", "text": "In an interesting moment of irony, we happened to get two Acclaim racing games for the PlayStation on the same day: Vanishing Point and RC de Go!.  On the one hand, we have a highly-touted racing game, which received a heavy push from its publisher, promising a ground-breaking, original experience.  As it turned out, it bites.  On the other hand, we have a game Acclaim bought secondhand from Taito, perhaps as part of some package deal with the PlayStation 2 Bust-a-Move game, and gave almost no support at all.  As it turned out, this one is darn near the best racer for the money on the PlayStation this fall.  I'm not kidding.  I say this in all seriousness: RC de Go! is a heck of a lot of fun, and it beats the living daylights of many of its full-size competitors.  If you've ever quailed at the price of your own RC racer, or if you can actually afford your own Tamiya-powered beast (like the Calsonic Skyline GT-R I've always wanted), or if you just want a quality racing game for what's likely going to be a bargain price, this game comes highly recommended.  Gameplay  RC de Go! (Japanese for ~Let's Go By RC!~, a pun on their famous train-conducting sims) may receive many comparisons to the classic RC Pro Am, but it's not a very similar game.  Pro Am was an arcade racing game with RC cars, whereas RC de Go! is actually a genuine simulation of remote-controlled car racing.  The perspective is an unusual one, although you can adjust to it surprisingly quickly.  You see the track through the eyes of a player sitting in a fixed position on the sidelines.  Your eyes then follow your little pocket racer as it zips around the track, negotiating the curves and speeding along the straights.  The game's control mimics proper RC racing as well, using the two Dual Shock analog sticks to represent the steering and throttle sticks of an RC controller.  The left analog moves you to the left and right, while you use the right analog to accelerate and brake.  That's not the most frequently-used control scheme for a genuine racer (although it pops up in the GTs and Test Drive) but in RC de Go!, it works extremely well, letting you brake and accelerate smoothly while steering through the twisty advanced tracks with their elevation changes and variable terrain.  The shoulder buttons activate a dash maneuver that you can use for a periodic boost in the straights (and to knock out other racers), but it steals most of your grip in the turns.  You deal with those more difficult tracks by upgrading your car - like a miniature Gran Turismo, RC de Go! offers a huge selection of realistic parts to modify and improve the performance of your racer.  There are a lot of parts here, a selection created to suit the expectations of the Japanese RC nuts that the game was originally aimed at.  You can upgrade your car's body, engine, servos, brakes, tires, suspension, and exhaust, as well as tuning it with special additions like new stabilizers and other parts - I count over 60 different upgrades.  The one disadvantage to the upgrade system is, unlike Gran Turismo, the emphasis is on simply tuning your rig up as far as it can go, rather than specializing in a particular area.  You can build a number of different-looking racers, but they'll basically be distinguished by their appearance and their level of power, rather than their skill in a particular area.  The game does offer a choice between on- and off-road racing, which have a somewhat different feel to their tracks and handling, but most of the races and racers basically differ in terms of difficulty and ability.  Graphics  Maybe it's a consequence of the small, enclosed spaces they occupy, but RC de Go!'s courses look great, and the field of little antenna-swinging racers buzz around them at a perfect clip.  The trackside architecture is bright and colorful, with lots of variety to the buildings, bridges, signs, and other odds and ends that occupy the spaces around the raceway.  Several tracks cross over water, where you'll see little model boats sailing around, and others feature Dave Perry's RC helicopter flying over the race.  The off-road tracks include many hills you can rush up or hop off, as well as water hazards you have to avoid or plow through.  Weather and seasons vary from circuit to circuit, and you'll see appropriate weather effects over some of them that, while simple, add a lot to atmosphere.  Rain is nice, but I liked the falling cherry blossoms on the third off-road circuit even more.  The cars are tiny, but the GT and rally models pack a fair amount of texture detail onto their miniature bodies - I can identify my default body as a pretty fair likeness of a Peugeot 306 rally car, and there are other notable lookalikes ranging from a Pennzoil Nismo GT-R to a Subaru Impreza WRC car.  They don't just sit on the road, too, instead showing off little bits of animation when they rock on their suspensions or whip their antennae about in a major turn.  The antennae also leave colorful little trails behind as you race along, and you leave tire tracks behind in the course when you hit a dash.  If you prefer something with a little less realism as far as looks go, of course, the game offers you plenty of selection when it comes to goofy body options, from a bullet train to a gopher to a sumo wrestler (not joking).  Sound  RC de Go!'s music is about as inconspicuous as you'd expect from a Japanese racing game - it's a sort of light pop answer to the imported Gran Turismo.  The buzz and hum of the little RC engines is re-created well, though, and the announcer is actually a neat touch, as he runs down the events of the race and exhorts you to push ahead more quickly or take the turns well. This is about as good a racer as you'll ever get for twenty dollars (aside from something like the Greatest Hits GT2), the price at which Acclaim will be releasing it.  RC de Go!'s one failing is that it's over somewhat quickly.  There are eight street races, eight off-road races, and a few unlockable special tracks, but even with the added options afforded by the upgrade system, you'll still blaze through most of the circuits pretty quickly.  The four-lap races are over in under a couple of minutes.But for twenty bucks, who cares?  RC de Go! is cute, fast, tightly designed, and offers more than enough replay value for its price.  The tracks and cars may be tiny, but I'll return to them for more races than I would many full-scale PlayStation circuits.", "date": "Nov 10, 2000"}
