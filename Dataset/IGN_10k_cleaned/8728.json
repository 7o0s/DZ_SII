Just look at a large part of popular anime, Starship Troopers, Aliens - there are myriad examples. With games, such an idea seems popular since gamers tend to accept that any semblance of plot, character, or logic can be shoved out the door in favor of flashy graphics and the ability to detonate satisfyingly sizable amount of explosives. Lost Planet adheres to such a notion.   You play as Wayne, who witnesses the death of his father at the mandibles of a large Akrid, the game's insect-like alien menace, named Green Eye. Wayne gets knocked out, or something, and is later rescued by a band of snow pirates on the snow-choked slopes of a planet called E.D.N. III. When he comes to, Wayne is suffering from amnesia, and spends the rest of the game avenging his fallen father and discovering the nature of his past. Cutscenes are inserted before each of the game's story missions, and you'll likely enjoy Lost Planet more if you skip them entirely. The characters Wayne meets are about as interesting as sheets of loose-leaf paper, the plot often takes nonsensical twists as unknown personages are introduced and disappear, and by the end of the game you may find yourself writhing in anguish or laughter at the forced, unnatural cadence of the voice acting and writing quality.    The action, though, is occasionally entertaining. E.D.N. III's perpetually frozen atmosphere lends a few unique twists to the gameplay. To stay alive in Lost Planet, you'll need to keep a constant supply of thermal energy (T-Eng) on hand. Snow pirate adversaries, NEVEC soldiers, mechanized Vital Suits (VSes), fallen Akrid, and various environmental structures all drop the substance in the form of orange pools. Walking over the temperate blobs boosts your reserves, a number constantly dwindling as heat is lost to the cold. On foot T-Eng automatically depletes at a leisurely pace, but you'll need to pay special attention to the meter when inside a VS, as it rapidly drains the total. Should it reach zero, expect to die shortly thereafter.   The T-Eng mechanic works in Lost Planet because it keeps you charging forward and forces you to engage their enemy, as Wayne must act as a sort of heat vampire. He's got a few useful abilities on foot, such as a piton gun to ascend and descend, a number of grenades, and the ability to carry two different types of weapons. Rocket launchers, shotguns, several varieties of plasma rifles, and more are available. Perhaps the most enjoyable ability is how Wayne can rip giant VS weapons off mechanized frames to use on foot. The VS shotgun is particularly useful, as it utterly decimates anything within close range. There's something seductively empowering about obliterating a walking mech while on foot wielding a giant gun, and Lost Planet offers ample opportunity to do so.   Then there's the VS combat, which allows for two mounted guns to fire simultaneously and offers different avenues of locomotion based on the suit. Some can double-jump, some can float through the air, some can transform (the spider mech is a personal favorite), and others can quick-dash across the ground. These things help to keep the combat varied and, with their super-powered weaponry, do a good job of instilling in the player a sense of strength on the battlefield. As mindless as it may be, there's a charm to flinging out hundreds of bullets within a matter of seconds and flattening a line of foes, or detonating explosive barrels, or drilling an enemy's weak point with a precision laser cannon blast and watching them writhe in pain. The later parts of the game, aside from the black sheep of a final stage, offer up some explosive set pieces that will undoubtedly appeal to your sense of gleeful, destructive indulgence. Despite the expanded set of locomotive options in VSes, the controls still feel clunky and imprecise, resulting in many moments where Wayne doesn't do what you tell him to.    Such awkward gameplay is further hindered by unsophisticated enemy behavior. Akrid, bosses, and VSes mount some interesting attacks, but the humanoid enemies are as intelligent as anyone who genuinely enjoys watching Deal or No Deal. They'll jump away from tossed grenades, but otherwise they stand and fire and that's it. Enemies seated in turrets are so brain-dead they won't even get out if you flank them, content to passively absorb ammunition into the backs of their heads.   As far as the actual gameplay goes, there are design quirks that we were never really able to get over. Wayne, for whatever reason, cannot look directly upwards. He's limited to about 150 degrees from his feet to the uppermost plane of his gun's aim making some of the game's giant boss encounters frustrating since you have to shoot up at their vulnerable points. You'll experience significant animation delays as well, most notably when Wayne gets hit by a rocket or while bounding around with the piton gun. In the midst of intense action sequences, this can really bog things down as you're forced to watch for several seconds as Wayne fumbles to regain his footing, hop up onto platforms, or get to his feet after an explosion. Against foes that fire out rockets with an assembly-line frequency, this can sometimes result in annoying rocket juggles. They're not inescapable, but in the middle of a fight it's unnecessarily distracting.   Yet another strange game design decision is the total lack of progress barriers in each stage. If you felt so inclined, it's entirely possible to bypass nearly every enemy and proceed directly to the endboss. Often there's so much incoming fire such a tactic is ill-advised, but it's still possible. If you did decide to sprint to the end you'd miss out on chunks of marginally enjoyable gameplay, so it's usually worthwhile to stick around, amass T-Eng, and scrape together the most effective arsenal for the boss battle as possible. While this isn't really a design flaw, it's definitely an odd, unconventional choice. We suppose it's better than magically demarcating an area with invisible walls, but there are ways to realistically section off a level to encourage a player to engage content rather than drive on through.     Despite its quirks, some of Lost Planet's console awkwardness has been smoothed out on PC since it now includes mouse and keyboard support. Along with the more precise mouse-controlled aiming are three aim modes that allow varying types of control freedom while running and gunning. In cruise mode, for instance, you'll get a small box in front of Wayne within which you're free to aim without actually causing your straightforward view to shift for a turning animation. In fixed mode, any mouse movement rotates your view around. Across the three modes, you'll find one to suit your liking, which is certainly preferable to being forced into an aim mode.   One unfortunate side effect of the improved aiming is a lessened degree of difficulty. Only while riding in a VS and battling giant Akrid, bosses, or other VSes will you experience any kind of challenge. In combination with the game's short campaign, this contributes to Lost Planet's largest flaws - a general lack of depth and replayability. Whereas other console-style action games like Devil May Cry or God of War have dynamic combo systems, the combat in this title feels too one-dimensional to really be considered a fulfilling experience. Sure, you could call it an arcade game if you wanted to excuse the gameplay's sparseness, but even then there just isn't enough meat attached to the game's skeleton to warrant continued attention.    This lack of depth is offset somewhat by four multiplayer modes. Elimination and Team Elimination are Lost Planet's deathmatch modes. Post Grab requires players control a larger number of beacons on a map by jamming on the use key when within range. Fugitive is set up with one player trying to stay alive as the rest of the field hunts them down. A few cool techniques online include using your piton gun to hang from ceilings, or tossing out deadly dummy grenades to confuse and kill newbies. The game has statistic tracking, so even Lost Planet has a leg up on online-only games like Shadowrun, which mysteriously lacks any kind of persistent rankings. Despite the options available, don't expect to find a new multiplayer love with this title considering the other options on the market offering more in-depth gameplay.   Actually, don't even expect to play multiplayer, since as of right now we can't seem to find any games online. The game's been out for a few days and despite frequent searches, we've only been able to get into two games. Each of those crashed within about five minutes of play, booting us back out to the server menu. We've created rooms as well, waited for up to 20 minutes for people to join, and still been the only one in the server. Considering how short the single player campaign is, you'll want to keep an eye out on Capcom's official Lost Planet forums as to when this game starts functioning properly in the online space.   If you enjoy the game's arcade-like feel, you might also be tempted to try out some of the higher difficulty levels and trying to hit all the hidden targets in each stage. Bumping up the difficulty dramatically affects the rapidity with which your T-Eng drains. We didn't find the gameplay to be compelling enough to warrant such continued play, however.    Then there's the graphics, which glitter so brilliantly in DX10 mode at 1920 x 1200 resolution that you may forget about the design hitches. The game looks even better at maxed settings than the Xbox 360 version, provided you have an insanely powerful rig. Using a Vista system with 4 GB RAM, a GeForce 8800 768 MB card, and a quad-core processor, we stilll weren't able to fully crank up every setting. On our Windows XP machines with lesser hardware, the game still looks pretty, but the settings have to be turned way down. If you don't have a rig toward the higher end of the mid-range spectrum, you may want to pass on this game. Though the action can occasionally be fun, this isn't something worth upgrading your computer for. And honestly, experiencing the visuals at a smooth framerate is one of this game's biggest treats. Though our DX10 experience was relatively smooth, we did experience a few crashes. When trying to switch from DX10 to DX9 mode on our Vista rig, the game would crash every time and force us to restart our computer to get it working again.If you're looking for a new console-style action game on PC, Resident Evil 4 is the better option. Sure it may have a dated look and require a controller, but its gameplay is far more satisfying than Capcom's Lost Planet. This title is more of an arcade game, though, which could excuse its transparent mechanics to a degree. But for an arcade game to succeed, it really needs tight, fluid methods for moving around, something Lost Planet's often cantankerous controls, even though they're better on PC, can only daydream about. What you get here caters to the mindless action fan - huge enemies, hulking weapons, monstrous explosions, and flashy visuals. Strip that away and there isn't much left. Aside from a few ~wow~ moments during boss battles and some decent multiplayer modes (when they're working), the gameplay is, for the most part, shallow and short on long-term appeal, and the characters and narrative are as enjoyable as waiting for the cable guy.", "date": "Jun 29, 2007"}
