The result? The Adventures of Brisco County Jr. of course. But one other likely outcome of the mixture is an incredibly fun and stylish game called Desperados. It's captivated me for two weeks now -- even causing me to skip out early on our weekly IGN yacht parties and clam dives. The game does have some significant shortcomings, particularly in terms of its interface, but with everything that the game gets right you'll find it hard to stay mad at it.  The story involves the robbery of a train and you've been hired to find out who's behind it. Along the way you'll have to shadow bandits to find their headquarters, rescue one of your teammates from the gallows and sneak into a US Marshal's outpost. There's lots more but I don't want to give too much away. In true Old West style, you begin the game with a single character and must go through the obligatory ~rounding up the old gang~ routine. You'll eventually have six characters at your disposal -- each with a unique batch of tricks and skills that you'll use to progress through the game's twenty-five missions.   Cooper is the main character. He carries a gun, a knife and a pocket watch. The knife can be used to kill folks or to cut ropes or harnesses. The pocket watch can be set to play a little tune to draw your enemies toward the source of the sound. Every character has a gimmick like this. Sam can tie up unconscious enemies or drop a rattlesnake on the ground as sort of an impromptu roadblock. Doc can pick locks and fling vials of knockout gas at your enemies. Kate has numerous methods of distracting or misleading opponents while Mia prefers to rely on the antics of her pet monkey, Mr. Leone, to confuse and baffle. Sanchez is the heavy of the group and can leave tequila bottles laying around in the hopes that your enemies will drink themselves into immobility. Each character has numerous other abilities that you'll need to fit into your plan if you want to succeed.  While the campaign is extremely linear and mission success is concrete, I was really pleased to see that the missions offer an opportunity for you to take your own approach. For me, this means killing everyone. I've resigned myself to never being very successful at games where you have to sneak around but Desperados offers that option as well. It's all in how you use your characters. Once again, for me, stealth just means killing everyone really quietly.  But there are some things wrong with the game. Perhaps the most awful thing is that your characters won't ever do anything on their own -- even if they're being attacked. While this is something of a necessity given the stealth-orientated nature of the game, it's gets irritating when your characters won't at least duck when they're shot at. I could even deal with this limitation if the characters would at least reload their guns on their own. I don't mind that it takes time to reload, but the amount of clicking required to get a character to even begin reloading is ridiculous. This is particularly problematic when you've got six characters involved in a firefight. Luckily ammo for your main weapon is infinitely if not conveniently replenishable.  A convenient macro lets you set up quick actions for your characters. For instance you can give Sanchez a delayed order to shot an opponent. As soon as you're ready for the order to be carried out, you simply hit a single button. With single characters it isn't all that useful. It is, though, when you're trying to coordinate the actions of several characters at once that you'll find this feature most useful.  From a standpoint of difficulty, Desperados is a little on the hard side (although not nearly as hard -- ~challenging~ is the PR word -- as the early builds of Commandos 2 we've played). Although there are significant differences among the various enemies, they are all pretty sharp. And since it only takes a shot or two to take out one of your characters (which instantly ends the game, by the way), the principle of ~save early, save often~ definitely applies here.  The game gets the style almost exactly right. It's important to note here that style is not necessarily the same as authenticity. Rather this game takes a much more cinematic approach to the subject. Haciendas, bandit camps, frontier towns and numerous other environments are convincingly laid out and brought to life with lots of bystanders. Scarecrows will scatter as you crawl through a cornfield and shopkeepers will run to get the local authorities when they see a crime. There's definitely a lot of atmosphere here and it pays off. The graphics are really sharp in the default view but when you zoom in for a close up things get really pixely.  The voice acting is simply bad though which really tends to be distracting. None of the accents sound convincing and the dialogue is crude. Little sound cues during the game are much better than the full conversations you'll listen to though. The music and sound effects are better still and help draw you into the game.  While there's a lot of hype and anticipation around Commandos 2, Desperados has definitely stolen some of its thunder by arriving five weeks earlier and fifteen dollars cheaper. We'll obviously have to wait until Commandos 2 is final before we can really compare the titles but the best thing about my job is that I get to play both of them anyway.  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
