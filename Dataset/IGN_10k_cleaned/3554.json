But until Soul Calibur 2 and the next version of Dead or Alive make it to Xboxes worldwide, titles like Marvel vs Capcom 2 will be the order of the day.   It's not that MvsC2 is a horrible game, it's just so full of contradictions that the initial bittersweet taste lingers on the palate as overwhelmingly bitter. First off, the Marvel license is a double edged sword these days. It's the hottest property going, right up there with WWII and Lord of the Rings, so the executives at mighty Marvel couldn't just let Capcom use the license for an online fighting game. ~Hell man,~ they said, ~That's an entirely different game you're talking about and you only paid us for an offline Marvel vs Capcom fighting series.~ To be sure Capcom saw the glorious opportunity for an online 2D fighter featuring Spider-Man, Hulk and Wolverine along with other Capcom favorites like Jill from Resident Evil and Ryu, but so did Marvel. In the end the publisher-licensor game of chess played between the two companies, leaves Xbox owners with an identical copy of the game that graced Dreamcast three years ago.   And when we say identical we mean identical. So much so that we have half a mind to just send you over to our Dreamcast channel so you can read all about MvsC2 there. But instead we'll continue to point out what has happened to Marvel vs Capcom in the transition from DC to Xbox.   The Xbox Live component of MvsC2 is an even worse tragedy. We told you last year that it was scheduled to be the first online fighter for Xbox and suggested that it might've even been a launch title. A three year old online 2D fighter at the launch of an online console service is held to a much different standard than an offline 2D fighter released a year and a half into the lifecycle of the most powerful console around. Capcom vs SNK 2 was Xbox Live compatible but didn't have the polish and follow-through Marvel vs Capcom 2 would've had because it ended up rushed to market as a last minute replacement for MvsC2. As a result, we're getting the same 2 player game here that we saw in the arcade in 1998 and on DC in 2000. Hardly worth $49.99, but then maybe that's why this game's being sold for $39.99.   Gameplay  You've done this before, but for those of you desperate for some newness, the Xbox controller works surprisingly well with this Capcom fighter as well. The fact that the control scheme is re-configurable makes it accessible to fight fans with the most obscure fighting game control preferences. You know the type. They have their hands clawed around some un-ergonomic part of the controller with what seems like six fingers positioned over the face buttons ready to pounce. We'd recommend investing in an arcade stick here, but we won't because the one you bought for the Dreamcast is still good enough.....because the Dreamcast version of MvsC2 is still good enough.  The game is bursting with a rich combo and special move system that will unleash more dazzling 2D effects than you've seen in a long time. This is still a strength of the title. I suppose we should be happy that Capcom didn't stumble over the control system or other game elements in bringing MvsC2 to the Xbox but knowing what the console is capable of, can't help but leave us a little disappointed when we see a game that was already zipping along when it was on the Dreamcast.   The lineup of the characters is the same too. Old favorites like Captain America and Zangief are available from the get-go with guys like Akuma and Blackheart becoming available as you progress through the game. You still earn points that can be spent on new characters and other goodies just like you'll remember from previous console versions of the game.   The head-to-head two player mode is still the heart and soul of this Capcom fighter. Unfortunately the whole concept of two players on a videogame at the same time was solved many many years ago and doesn't carry the same impact that it used to.   Graphics  Ugh. Even the menus are choppy for some strange reason. But then again, there's no excuse for text and other important bits of information falling off the edge of our TV screens. On the pre-match screen, you can guess that you're picking alpha type assist by realizing that beta and gamma are below it....but you shouldn't have to.   The characters look arcade perfect which means you'll see the best two dimensional fighting action 1998 had to offer shimmering on your television. In 1998, everything looked good, which is why any recent college graduate with a wacky idea and enough smart-alecky attitude could yank millions out of a venture capital company in their quest to become rich snobs, instead of broke jerks. Now in 2003, things aren't so rosy and everybody that doesn't know a politician personally is as broke and devoid of enthusiasm as this game's graphics.   Any kind of graphics or animation upgrade would've been appreciated.  Sound  We still love the voice samples as the characters announce the moves their throwing. ~Charging Star~ and ~Berskerer Barrage~ are now classics right up there with ~Yoga Fire!~ and whatever the hell it is that Ryu and Ken are always saying.  The music is the worst thing ever. Bad lounge music on out of tune synthesizers would be better than the indescribable pop/folk/rock/elevator fusion built in to Marvel vs Capcom 2. We'd give our kingdom of Xbox games for a fighting title that allowed for custom soundtracks.  You're better off picking up a Dreamcast and a copy of this game for $40 rather than spending that $40 on the Xbox version. At least that way you can perpetrate like you're a hardcore gamer.This game is too old to be worth 80% of a real Xbox game and not old enough to get the nod from nostalgic ~old school~ gamers. MvsC2 is a disaster waiting to happen when a good-intentioned older female relative wanders into a retailer to pick up something ~new~ for you. All of this hostility is because it's not an online fighting game as originally promised and instead is just another 2D fighter with outdated graphics on the most powerful home console around. It's not that 2D fighting is dead, but it damn sure doesn't need to be resurrected in this fashion.", "date": "Apr 1, 2003"}
