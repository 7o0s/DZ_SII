Other than that, there's not much good to say about Rules of the Game, the new sports trivia game from developer Random Games and publisher Infogrames.  Maybe we had certain pre-conceptions about what a sports trivia game should be before we started into this one. But this definitely was not what we thought it should be.  This is more about sports rules than actual sports trivia knowledge. In other words, you have to know whether a certain football play results in a 5- or 10-yard penalty, but not who the leading NFL rusher of all time would be.  And that's fine for a 20-second IBM ~You Make the Call~ commercial. But it doesn't hold up so well for a whole game.   You begin it all with a little bad menu music greeting you, and then you move into the real downer about the game -- the host. His name is Joe Banks and he gets annoying very quickly. He's badly animated and has terrible quips and jokes as dialogue, to boot.  As for the rest of the game's sound, there's not much to speak of. About all you have is the occasional bing, beep, or buzz of answered or missed questions. Other than that, it's just the horribly annoying host repeating his terrible jokes ad infinitum.  The graphics are fairly good, but limited, as you might expect. There's not an awful lot to do for the game's graphical engine. It is a trivia game, after all. The host looks a little too squared off, with stiff animations to move him around for his reactions to your answers.  Once you get used to the fact that you'll have this major annoyance running the game for you, you're off to start answering questions. Spin the wheel and you'll be given a category in which to answer a question.  Categories range from football (college and pro), to basketball (college and pro), to golf, to baseball, to miscellaneous (which could be anything on the board).  In Round One, you must answer three questions, in Round Two, you'll face two questions, and in Round Three, you only get one question, but it's worth 1,000 points.  Along the way, you might pull up one of the mini-games within the rules trivia, too. These are much better questions and a relief from the regular queries.  One such mini-game is ~Hey! Watch Those Hands!~ in which you must identify a referee's hand signals. Another is ~Where Am I?~ in which you must listen to the clue and decide what place they are talking about (usually a stadium or a city).  The more questions you get right, the more points you earn. Collect enough points, and you'll be ~the winner,~ though the game never really spells out what that means. All we could tell it did was get your name on the high score board.  As we said, the questions are more about rules than actual sports trivia. For instance, the game may ask you if a home run ball flies over the fence, then curves into foul territory afterward, is it considered a home run? (The answer, by the way, is yes, as long as it leaves the playing field as a fair ball, then it is considered a home run).  For a sports trivia game, we'd much rather have to answer actual sports trivia questions. For instance, what was the nickname of the old Tampa Stadium? Or, how many times did Jack Nickalus win the Masters? Those sorts of questions would be much more fun, and less annoying, to answer.  The game does offer mutliplayer options, either through a network game, or via GameSpy Arcade. The game says that up to four players can compete. Though we tried, we couldn't find anyone on GameSpy to play against.  Rules of the Game is decent enough for a little diversion -- maybe five or ten minutes. But deciphering the rules of sports strikes us more as something a part-time referee might enjoy, and not the casual sports fan, at which this game is obviously aimed.  -- Mike Morrissey", "date": "Jun 21, 2001"}
