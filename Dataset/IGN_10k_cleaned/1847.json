It puts the player in control of Aladdin and friends, as they must save Agrabah and themselves from the evil doings of the sorceress Nasira, who is out to avenge the death of her twin brother, Jafar. While it might be a frantic battle between good and evil, gamers, regardless of age, shouldn't expect much in the way of innovation.   Gameplay If you've played any 3D-platform game on the PlayStation, you pretty much know what to expect from Aladdin in Nasira's Revenge because this title doesn't introduce anything new to the genre. The control is a bit loose and doesn't quite have the same level of precision that you'll get in games like Spyro or Crash, but it isn't problematic and none of the game's platform jumping sequences are ever overly challenging because of issues with the control.   Aladdin has all of your basic moves including the ability to knock out enemies with a sword or by throwing apples at them or doing your standard butt-stomp on them. There are also some more advanced moves that can be performed including sliding down clotheslines, swinging on ropes, going into first-person mode to target apple throws, plus a few other things. And when in control of other characters in the game, such as the ever-popular and comical monkey, Abu, other moves will be opened up to the player such as double jumps off of walls and other character specific stunts.   The level design is pretty traditional in that each is setup in a way that the player has to find a key or solve a puzzle to open up each subsequent area of the game. There are a quite a few levels, though, an some of the latter ones have some decently designed platform jumping sequences and puzzles. None of it is overly complex, but that's largely due to the fact that the game is obviously intended for the younger gamer and not the platform gaming veteran.   The coolest aspect of the game is undoubtedly the variety of in-between level mini-games that helps give the players a break from the straightforward platforming gameplay. These mini-games range from standard side-scrolling type stuff from hopping on clouds or flying around on a magic carpet to 3D target shooting and other really fun stuff that kids will surely enjoy.   But even given its target audience, the game does have some gameplay issues that will cause problems and are worth complaining about. The general camera control is a bit clumsy and there are too many times where it's near impossible to get a good look at the onscreen action. There are two different ways to handle the camera work in the game, but neither is that effective.   Graphics The developers have done an admirable job of trying to get the game to look a little cartoonish while in a 3D world, but they probably would've been better served by making a 2D game, as the Genesis version of Aladdin is a more visually pleasing product on the whole. The characters are minimally animated and while the backgrounds are filled with lots of vibrant colors, they're plagued with lots of ugly graphical glitches in the form of clipping, bad draw-in, and even some slowdown.   Sound The game's audio is definitely its strongest aspect. The music isn't all that exciting, but there are plenty of happy, cheerful beats that fit the game's mood perfectly and some of the music used is actually straight from the animated film. The voice acting is extremely well done and the voice actors that have been used for the game are the same ones that have done the voices for the characters in the animated TV series. Nothing here is out of this world, but it's completely befitting of the game and works well in this particular case.  The trouble with Aladdin and other recently released licensed 3D platforms that have been targeted for younger gamers is that they haven't necessarily been bad games -- just very generic and mediocre ones. Aladdin brings nothing new to the platform genre and isn't even in the same league as the Spyro's, Sonic's, Crash's and Mario's of the world. It's a very basic platformer that young kids that haven't played many games can enjoy because it's not overly complicated and is based on a license that is well liked. But, if you're looking for a game for your young gaming freak, he or she would be much better served if you gave them one of the aforementioned platformers, before you pick this one up. That is, unless they're demanding an Aladdin game and won't take anything else.", "date": "Mar 17, 2001"}
