The absolute core of the gameplay depends on a rock-solid sense of speed -- a sense of speed you can only get if the game is screaming along at 60 frames a second. Luckily, Burnout delivers every bit of speed you'll need, and then tosses in even more should you play the role of daredevil successfully for a while. I think I may be getting ahead of myself, though.    Gameplay  We'll start at the beginning. There's no story for Burnout, but you don't really need one either; it IS a racer, after all. The only goal is to make it to the finish line, preferably while leaving the pack in a cloud of dust. It sounds typical, and at its core, this racer doesn't stray too far from the tried-and-true path of racers before it, but there's one little area that keeps everything fresh: danger. The crazier you drive, the more boost in your meter you'll accrue. Fill it all the way, and it's open for use whenever you want. But there's always a catch, isn't there? The only way to fill it is, as we said, to head into risky driving territory. This means racing into oncoming traffic, sliding up to a car and missing it by a hair, or throwing yourself into a controlled slide (read: drift). The more you do it, the faster the boost gauge will fill.    The problem with all this daredevil driving is that it puts you at unbelievable risk for a crash, a cringe-inducing, jaw-dropping, eye candy-laced dance of metal on metal that is easily the best looking example of automotive collision you'll ever see in a game. Glass shatters, chassis crumple, and the screen launches into a sickly sweet triple pass highlighting your crash. So while it looks cool, and to be honest, it never really gets old because of how well it's all pulled off, it DOES cost you some valuable time, something that's a precious commodity in Burnout, because as much as you're racing opponents, you're also trying to hit the next checkpoint in time. On some courses, just crashing one too many times can mean the difference between running out of time, or rolling across the line to extend your limit.    What makes Burnout so good isn't necessarily the looks, though I'm constantly impressed by how flexible Criterion's RenderWare is for delivering different games. From Rayman to Airblade to Burnout, no two games really has the same feel, an impressive feat for any renderer. But no, it's not the graphics that are the highlight, it's the gameplay, something rarely touted as the best feature in a game on the PlayStation 2. There's a perfect blend of incredibly fast driving coupled with a need to push your luck with risky driving. The only way to fill your boost is to drive like a madman, but do it without suffering a crash, which obviously saps time, but erases any boost you may have grabbed along the way. Besides being a perfect source of an adrenaline high, there's the added bonus of possibly opening up the ability to blast ahead, and as fast as you fly around the courses normally, the boost makes that look like you were standing still.     Graphics  As I said before, the RenderWare platform has served as an amazingly diverse graphical base for a handful of completely different games. Luckily, it's as pretty as it is flexible. Burnout doesn't have GT3-level graphics, but since the only time you'll ever have a chance to stop and check out the scenery is when you're in the middle of a crash replay (even race replays feature cameras that are in constant motion), so the graphics are more than adequite. High-res textures have been wrapped around all of the main track objects, so you'll see plenty of diversity throughout the course, particularly because the tracks wind through a couple of different venues as they loop around. Just because you started out in a sun-drenched alleyway, doesn't mean you'll stay there for long, so take in the sights well as you rev your engine, cause in a few short seconds it'll all be a blur.    Everything from cracked, crumbling pavement to neat cobblestone streets and just about every driving surface in between (even a chance for a short rally racing break) is smoothed over the ground. Buildings range from metropolitan skyscrapers to tiny European hamburgs, each offering their own particular style. The trackside details don't extend too far past the extra traffic/extra building/extra boat variety, but for a game of this type, it's fine.    Again, the solidity and speed of Burnout bears repeating. The only reason this game feels so good is because it moves so smoothly and quickly, screaming along at a rock-solid 60 frames, and slathering on effects like motion blur at key moments like during crash replays and as the boost kicks in. The sense of speed is fantastic, and since that's one of the key selling points of a game like Burnout, it's nice to see Criterion didn't drop the ball.    Sound  One of the key reasons why Burnout's crashes are so, well, satisfying is that sickening crunch of metal on metal. The sound of a bumper melding with the business end of a tanker sounds fantastic (it's not like I've had a lot of experience with the real-life version of that aural treat, luckily). Glass shatters and tires squeal as the car usually does a couple full revolutions and comes to a stop a few hundred feet from impact, and the whole auditory experience just helps add that much more punch to the visuals.   The rest of the in-game effects hold up well, though if you're looking for perfectly recorded engine noise, you'll have to head to GT3. Still, when you're flying around a corner at a hundred miles an hour or so, the farthest thing from my mind is how accurate that engine sounds at that many rpm's. The squeak of tires gripping, then losing traction sounds great, as does the separation of audio for things like car horns and off-screen crashes as you fly through busy streets, and generally just feels nice and solid.   Music, again, helps pull the whole package together, both in design and execution. There's a limited amount of interactivity to the music. It's not as good as the on-the-fly mixing ability of SSX and its Tricky sequel, but it does mean you'll hear some clever musical punctuation as the clock slowly, methodically ticks down those last few remaining seconds as you head for the next checkpoint. It's also luckily rather good on its own, blending laid back, poppy beats with a few layers of strings and plucky baselines. Techno is such a catch-all word for a genre, but it's obvious a bit of the UK electronica sound has had influence on the soundtrack.Burnout isn't insanely deep or endlessly customizable, it's not a revolution in racing perfection or a paradigm shift in how games are played, but it IS remarkably good. It's a near-perfect blend of classic racing action with enough innovation thanks to the boost meter system to keep it from falling into any predictability traps. If you're looking for a good, solid racing game that will absolutely, positively satisfy your need for an overabundance of speed and destruction, this is THE game for you. Even if you're not a hardcore racing fan, or if you're just looking for something different, you owe it to yourself to experience Burnout.", "date": "Nov 2, 2001"}
