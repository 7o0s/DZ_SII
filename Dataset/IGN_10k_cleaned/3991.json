Puyo Pop, of course. The popular (no pun intended) Japanese puzzle series has spanned almost as many platforms as genre granddaddy Tetris, so it's no surprise that Nokia's little newcomer got blessed with its own version as well.  But not all is well with Lavastorm's port of the Compile cum Sega franchise title. While the graphics are well-defined when compared to other handheld incarnations of Puyo Pop, the game suffers from the typical array of launch title woes.  Features  Three single-player modes 12 different AI opponents. Wireless two-player head-to-head mode High score saving   Gameplay Better known in the west for its localized versions (Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine and Kirby's Avalance), the Puyo Puyo/Pop franchise is rooted in the principle that the simplest puzzle games are the best. If you've never played it, here's how it works: pairs of beans in five different colors fall into a Tetris-style well. The objective is to connect four or more same-colored beans to make them pop. For higher points, players can set up chain reactions by carefully planning bean placement ahead of time. Junk blocks (~refugees~) that can only be cleared by popping an adjacent group of colored beans complicated matters, but that's pretty much the basic gist of how Puyo Pop plays.  The N-Gage version features three different single-player modes. ~Scenario~ adds the usual nonsensical storyline to the puzzle popping gameplay and has you compete against 12 different AI opponents, ~Exercise~ is basically an endless mode that lets you choose from three difficulty settings (Level 1, 5, or 9) and just play for fun, and ~Puzzle~ has you try and accomplish specific objectives (such as clearing all blocks of one color or clear the entire screen).   While the amount of modes or options is in line with previous versions of the game, the actual gameplay isn't. The N-Gage seems to have no problem handling 3D games like Tomb Raider or Tony Hawk, but when it comes to duplicating decade old 2D gameplay, it chokes? The hardware should be able to handle games like Puyo Pop with ease, but for some reason Puyo Pop feels sluggish and unresponsive, especially when played on the higher levels. Good puzzle games start out slow, but turn into frantic mayhem in the hands of an expert player -- sadly, slow bubble popping animations and unresponsive movement keep Puyo Pop for N-Gage from accomplishing that lofty goal. But an even bigger problem is the developer's choice to ignore the idiosyncrasies of the N-Gage display and to try and duplicate the standard bean colors of red, green, yellow, blue and purple. While the first three are no problem, it's difficult to tell blue and purple apart on the system's screen. It's possible, mind you, as the puyos all have slightly different shapes (and look into different directions), but squinting at the screen trying to tell the colors apart wasn't a challenge the originators of the series intended. It's puzzling, too, as the score display at the top of the screen proves that it's not that hard to create a solid object in a lighter blue.   On the multiplayer front, Puyo Pop for N-Gage enables two players (each with his or her own copy of the game) to go head to head via wireless Bluetooth technology. There aren't any mode variations or handicap settings, just the standard two-player versus mode (do combos and you'll send junk blocks to the other player), but the link-up works flawlessly. We've played two-player Puyo against each other from different cubicles, 20 feet apart, without wires or a direct line of sight. Wireless multiplayer is definitely one of the biggest attractions of Nokia's new system and we're hoping to see it in plenty of titles in the future.  Graphics The N-Gage version looks similar to the more recent Puyo Pop, release on GBA. The graphics remain simple and the screen setup works perfectly with the tall format of the N-Gage screen. Simple cut-scenes with anime-style characters tell the story, but it's all basic stuff with little to no animation.  Sound The quality of the audio is actually not bad, but the tunes are so short that they loop within a matter of seconds. That means the melodies will get old really quickly. Luckily, there is an off-setting for the sound, which can be accessed from the options menu. Like with many of the previous Puyo ports, sound effects are confined to blips and bleeps and sound as dated as always. Puyo Pop is an unambitious port of a good puzzle game. It's a testimony to the game's tried-and-true formula that despite the speed and color flaws, it still remains playable and enjoyable to a certain extent. The two-player Bluetooth mode is great fun, but there is simply nothing here that we haven't seen before. As a matter of fact, the N-Gage version is weaker than all the previous handheld Puyos we've played. While GBA owners got four-player battles (using only one cart) and 15 AI opponents, N-Gage players can play two-player or compete against 12 opponents. Considering the number of puzzle games we're likely to see on the handheld in the future, you can easily skip this version of Puyo Pop and wait for something better.", "date": "Oct 8, 2003"}
