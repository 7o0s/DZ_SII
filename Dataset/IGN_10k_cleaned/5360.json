The most recent and the most surprising is 989 Sports' Gretzky NHL 2005, a title that fits snugly between the fast-paced arcade feel of EA's NHL 2004 and ESPN Videogames' stellar sim-slanted ESPN NHL 2K5. It has a sped-up pace and plenty of attitude, but doesn't skimp on the strategy. The game is well made, well presented, and has plenty of different modes to play. In short, it's 989's best hockey game to date and its most impressive offering in years.   The game that is now Gretzky used to be FaceOff, and for those that remember that series, rest assured that this is a completely different beast. Everything has been overhauled and made better: from the graphics to the feature set to the gameplay. Of these, gameplay is usually of the greatest concern, and that is thankfully one of Gretzky's biggest strengths.   There's nothing revolutionary about the way the game goes about its business. There aren't any signature gimmicks here. What Gretzky NHL 2005 essentially does is borrow what has worked in other games, tweaking it slightly, and combining those elements into an enjoyable hockey experience. There's a big emphasis on end-to-end hockey here. Passes are crisp and fast (even passes from the goaltender), wrist shots blaze, and goalies keep up with the action.   The pace of play is one of the game's strongest points. It never approaches the blistering speed of Midway's Hitz series, but the action is always frantic and therefore usually fun. One of the things that keep the game moving is fairly realistic goalie play. Sure, the netminders make some pretty amazing saves, but they also leave some fat rebounds, which is nice to see. Too often, hockey videogames seem unwilling to allow for second chance opportunities. Here, many of your scoring opportunities, as in the real NHL, will come off of a carom or deflection.    Click For More Images The controls are intuitive and easy to manage, and feel fairly natural for those who have played other hockey titles in this generation. The only thing that's slightly problematic is making slapshots. In order to shoot one, you have to press and hold the shoot button while a little gauge fills up. Problem is, the gauge fills rather slowly, so it's almost impossible to set up a real humdinger of a shot without it getting interrupted. Therefore, most of the offense in the game is reduced to wrist shots and one-timers.    One interesting aspect of shooting is that when you cock your stick and get ready to let fly with a shot, a target will appear on the goal showing where the goaltender is vulnerable. This is an interesting wrinkle and can be helpful on the lower difficulty settings, especially for those who are having trouble scoring.    On the defensive side of things, the coolest thing going is the ability to change the direction of your skater. By hitting R2, you can flip your guy around and skate facing the oncoming rush, which is invaluable in many situations. You'll need this control, too, because sometimes the CPU puts your defenders into weird positions. Sometimes when a defender should be attacking a play, or challenging a forward, he can be found lollygagging near the goal. In some cases, it is also hard to select the defender nearest the puck and get him going the right way before danger strikes. It doesn't happen all the time, but it happens enough to bear mention.   Both sides of the puck have quick strategic commands that can be called by flicking a direction on the D-Pad. There are different play calls for every situation. If you want to dump and chase, simply call the play, wing the puck into the corner and your computer teammates will know what to do. If you want to work the triangle or set up the give-and-go, those things are available to you. Novice players probably won't care much to use these tactics, but it's nice to see them included for gamers who know the difference between a zone and a trap.    Fighting is also carried out on the D-Pad. If you enter into a situation where a fight is about to go down, an icon will appear onscreen, and if you want to start a fight, all you have to do is press down on the D-Pad. Fighting is so rudimentary it almost isn't worth it. X punches and square blocks, and that's about it.    In terms of modes, Gretzky NHL 2005 is pretty loaded. In addition to Practice, Tournament and Exhibition modes, there is a Franchise mode (which we'll discuss below), online play, Rivalry Mode and the World Cup. Rivalry Mode records the results of an ongoing grudge match between two teams, allowing you to save stats and records based on the rivalry. It's a great mode for friends or roommates, especially those who always play with their favorite teams. World Cup mode allows you to play the round robin tourney with the country of your choice.    The Franchise mode doesn't have a lot of the bells and whistles of its competitors, but all the standard things are in place. There is plenty of stat tracking, the ability to set your team's general style of play, edit lines, trade players and track finances in the front office. In addition, before you start Franchise play you can choose to create your own team, including their uniform and arena (to some degree). There is also the option to begin a Franchise with a fantasy draft, selecting your squad from a pool of all NHL players. Once the season begins, it's not the deepest Franchise around, but most gamers won't be disappointed.    Graphically, the game is uneven. Player models are a bit generic and faces could be a lot better. On the other hand, the arenas and crowds look good..Animations are a mixed bag. Sometimes skaters look herky-jerky when moving down the ice, but goalie animations look surprisingly fluid and realistic.    However, where Gretzky really shines is in presentation. Taking a page from ESPN's book, there are some nice between-play cut scenes, like two players jostling for position at the face-off circle. After the game, the three stars skate out, and later the players will head back to the locker room and register their joy or frustration. In addition, the automatic replays are quite well done. There are almost always multiple camera angles presented, and the clips chosen are always clear and explanatory, especially the shots of saves. Even the wipes between the replay and live action look icy nice.    Like EA, Sony has tried to load up on hip bands to furnish a compelling soundtrack. However, aside from the Von Bondies' ~C'Mon C'Mon~ there isn't a standout track in the mix. That's not a big gripe, since you'll only be hearing those cuts in menus and in short snippets in the arena.   In the areas that really matter (sound effects and commentary) the game does a good job. The commentary is at times rather generic, but that beats being repetitious. Where ESPN draws attention to itself by including unique quips that are easily recognizable, Gretzky's play-by-play is largely forgettable.Even though it's the third game to a crowded party, Gretzky NHL 2005 has a lot of merit. It's a good blend of fast-paced and sim-style hockey, and it's got plenty of modes to keep gamers busy. While many elements of the game are a bit generic the fact that the gameplay is fun and challenging makes up for a relative lack of personality. Page 44 and 989 deserve a lot of credit for completely refurbishing the game that used to be FaceOff. With Gretzky NHL 2005, 989 is again a contender.", "date": "Dec 1, 2004"}
