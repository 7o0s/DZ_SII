The more I think back on games like Double Dragon and Bionic Commando, the more I wish things would  go back to the way they used to be.  Of course, then again, every once and a while a game comes along that makes me realize why I thank the gods of gameplay advancement on a daily basis for titles like Half-Life and Metal Gear Solid.  As much as I hate to say it, Dynamite Cop is one of those games.  And the sad truth is, it's not that the game is terribly ugly, or that the control is off, it's just that the whole affair is rather reminiscent of my last relationship.  You know, it looks good, and you have fun with it, but where's the substance?  More importantly, after you're done with the wham-bam, thank you m'am, is there any reason to give it a second go?  Well, as you can see, I did just compare it to my last relationship, which means that I'm obviously not still in the act of enjoying this arcade port.  So what went wrong?  Well, I don't exactly know where to start.  It's not like longevity was never a staple of the beat-em up genre, and it's not as if they wouldn't have their place in this generation if done properly.  Hell, if Dream Factory's The Bouncer is actually playable, then I'm sure I'll be all over that bad boy.  Even Sega's own Zombie Revenge is looking incredible. But this?  Oh no.  If this is indicative of the next generation of console gaming, then I'll be holding off on the Final Fight clones until the next round.  Before I get away from myself, let me clear up a few things.  In all fairness, Dynamite Cop was fun for about 20 minutes.  It has some visual moments, and the cut-scenes, though laughable, do a pretty good job of carrying the story.  The characters themselves are pretty well done, and the animations are simple but effective.  You always get a sense of the pounding you're dishing out, and every once in a while new moves will spring up and surprise you.  Unfortunately, the same can't be said for much else in the game.  The character design seems uninspired, and with the exception of the bosses, it really seems as if you're beating the crap out of the same guys, over and over again.  The same could be said of the weapons, which outside of the nuke-hurling bazooka, are nothing new or interesting.  This is also the primary problem with the game's level design, which chronicles the player's romp through a cruise ship that has been taken over by, of course, evil pirates.  Obviously, there are some cool moments, like the fight in the kitchen or the giant squid, but the problem is they are too few and far between.  For the most part you're just beating the snot out of some random guy in a room, and it never really makes you stop and go ~cool.~  Personally, after experiencing games like ZR in the arcades, I expect a bit more mood, and this simply does not cut it.  The game tries to mix it up a bit with different ~missions~, but taking the Ridge Racer approach to level design didn't go over well with racing games, and it isn't exactly lighting the world on fire in this genre, either.   In case you can't tell, this game has one critical flaw.  It gets old fast.  And believe it or not, this is a bigger problem with Dynamite Cop than any game before it.  And why's that, you ask?  Well, let me explain it by sharing a fun little story with you.  At this year's E3 show, I played through the DC demo at the Sega booth with IGNDC's Colin ~Lousy Partner~ Williamson.  In about 20 minutes, we breezed through the demo, talked some smack, and after we gave the final boss a good one-two punch, exchanged some high fives, and that was my first look at Dynamite Cop.  At that point, I was looking forward to a better look at this one.  I mean hey, a good 5-6 levels of this could be pretty sweet if the bad guys got a little bit of variety in their repertoire.  Needless to say, I couldn't wait to go toe-to-toe with the import when I got it few weeks later.  Imagine my surprise and utter disbelief when I found out that the demo Colin and I played through wasn't actually an E3 quickie, but the entire Dynamite Cop experience.  I beat the game in (count 'em) 17 minutes my first time through, and that was that.  Considering this was a $50 dollar discovery, and I managed this fleet-footed time by myself (it would have taken even less time with a partner), I felt a little bit like a fantasy football fan who'd picked up Randy Moss in the draft in the early goings without considering what the loss of their offensive coordinator to the Ravens would do to his catches.  Where the hell are my 17 touchdowns?  Where's my all-pro season?  They're lost in the land of what could have been.  Please note that I know the defense has been overplaying my boy, but this was a statistical analogy. Anyways, my point is, I came in expecting a game that was at least as memorable as River City Ransom with better visuals, but what I got was a conceptual demo that put me out $50, and to be honest it just is not worth your time. Dynamite Cop is an arcade beat-'em up that was supposed to be a next-generation example of what to expect from the house that Streets of Rage built, but instead plays more like a drunken bum who can't remember what corner he sleeps on. I'm still trying to get over the fact that sub-par titles like this and Landers are shoe-ins for our shores, yet the status of a game like VOOT is in doubt.  Give me a break.  Rent this one if you have to, but in all honesty, you'd be better served to break out your Genesis and give an old favorite a try. It may not be a better game, but at least it has nostalgia going for it, and chances are it's longer.  That counts for something . . .  -- Brandon Justice, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 3, 1999"}
