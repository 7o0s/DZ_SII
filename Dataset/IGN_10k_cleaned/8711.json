The effect is eerie. Waving your wand around using the right analogue stick sees Harry's rubbery arm snarling and swirling, ignoring any and all bones, ready to strike. Of course, this is probably a necessary evil of the new spellcasting system in The Order of the Phoenix. Rather than simply pressing a button to, say, levitate an object, you must now learn specific movements of the right analogue stick, effectively performing the spell yourself. It's a good idea, and while it may make more sense for a system like the Wii, works well on PS2. There are six combat spells and six non-combat spells to learn, from Accio - pulling an object towards you, which requires motioning down twice, through to Stupefy, which requires moving the right analogue stick counter-clockwise in order to stun an opponent. All the character's arms may look like the aforementioned surgically grafted snake, but the system works well.   Sadly, the rest of the game is less of a success. In fact, we can sum up Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on PS2 for you in one word: busywork. Most of the gameplay revolves around meeting a student or teacher, being given a task, then running around the school collecting stuff. It's not exactly riveting, and aside from the Harry Potter veneer, is almost identical to the vanilla-flavoured gameplay we've been subjected to in countless other action adventure games in the past. Whether you'll want to persist will be in direct relation to your threshold for boredom and your love for the books/films. Actually, no, we take that back. For those who can stand monotonous tasks, there's a fair bit to keep you occupied in this game, but for the Harry Potter fans - including myself - the experience will be bittersweet.    What's the deal with homework? I mean, you're not working on your home!  You see, The Order of the Phoenix is really just a hollow representation of the world and the events in the book. Before we sink the boot in though, it's important to emphasise that there are some very strong elements for the Potter connoisseur. A lot of love has been poured into the setting for instance - Hogwarts looks magnificent and is just as sprawling and labyrinthine as you'd expect. The game opens with a fly-through, following Hedwig through the school; from the expansive castle grounds, into the Main Hall, up the Great Staircase, then past the Fat Lady and into the Gryffindor common room. The school really bustles with activity too. This is not a sterile place; students wander the halls and courtyards, study in the library and visit the Owlery. (Even if they do 'bustle' in short, controlled loops). Perhaps coolest of all, as Harry wanders the grounds the atmosphere is just as it should be in terms of the wider story, with many of the students making snide comments and singing derogatory jingles as he walks past. Stop to talk to anyone in the corridors and at the least they'll say 'hi', at the most, a Slytherin may call Hermione a mudblood or a Hufflepuff may give you a password for a secret passage. All the characters from the series are present and correct, and the character models look about as good as the PS2 is going to get.   So far so good right? So why then is this game 'hollow'? For a number of reasons. At the top of the pile is the fact that it relies on lukewarm tried-and-dull gameplay in favour of actually trying to describe or flesh out the storyline. If you haven't read the fifth book, or seen the fifth film (due out mid-July), the events in the game aren't going to make much sense. While there's stacks of incidental dialogue - which is great - the developer hasn't made much of an effort to give you the full story. Perhaps understandable given how dense it is, but relying on the audience to know all the details is lazy, and represents a missed opportunity, not just for casual fans, but for the hardcore too.    The Great Staircase. Great as in big, mind you. Even though it is, also, great.  After all, a lot of what goes on in The Order of the Phoenix is sociological, and about the machinations of power. Harry and Dumbledore's names are dragged through the mud by a Ministry of Magic looking to deny the return of Voldemort, leaving the wizarding community divided. This then flows through to the atmosphere at Hogwarts, where Harry spends a lot of the book angry and railing at the world. Worse still, Dolores Umbridge - a Ministry stooge - has been sent in to take on the Defence Against the Dark Arts position and eventually take over control of the school. Hence, Harry and co. form Dumbledore's Army (DA), a secret class to learn and practice the spells that will keep them alive in the event of a fight against Death Eaters. Sadly, only the broadest brushstrokes of this story make it into the game.     Yes, Harry, Ron and Hermione still form the DA, but instead of really expanding on the moody, angry tone of the book, the game instead turns it into a generic set of quests. Using the Marauder's Map (a nice touch) you can see where all the relevant students are and must travel about the school visiting them, then completing utterly dull retrieval quests, which then locks them in to attend the first meeting. Sigh. Rinse and repeat for the 28 students, and throw in even more random collectables throughout Hogwarts - things to repair, paintings to put back on walls, plaques to uncover, and objects to interact with, all of which net you Discovery Points, which unlock extras. Sure, you're using your wand a lot, but never in a particularly interesting way.    By way of example, one instance really stuck in my mind. You have to find the 'Monster Book of Monsters' for someone in the library. Turns out it's in the next room. Now, you guys know this critter right? The angry muppet book that could take your arm off? Well, you spot it, but instead of having to think for a second, and perhaps use 'Stupefy' in order to pick it up, you just, erm, pick it up. Then take it into the next room. It's only a small example, but it's reflective of the lack of ambition in the gameplay as a whole. Why play to the strengths of the world, giving the collection quests at least a tiny element of lateral puzzle solving, when you can just fill it with mindless busywork?   The wizarding equivalent of pistols at dawn.  So. Rather than a faithful interactive companion to the book and film, what we have here is a shallow simulacrum of the story and characters. What Harry Potter fan wouldn't cringe upon arriving at 12 Grimmauld Place at the start of the game to find happy-go-lucky housekeeper Sirius, who's more than happy to demonstrate spells for Harry and chums through household chores? Who is this guy and what did he do with the caged-in, frustrated Sirius that should be there? The only thing he's missing is an apron. It's like this all the way through - characters and events are misrepresented, underrepresented or glossed over.   The game isn't helped by a number of complaints familiar to anyone who has played an average third person adventure game over the last ten years. Harry controls like some kind of robot - too slow and awkward when walking, but like steering an iceberg when running. Compounding this are the camera issues, which regularly frustrate as it swings and jumps about. Yes, Harry, I did want you to walk into that wall. Throw in getting stuck on other students as you're wandering about - usually the ever-present Ron and Hermione, and you have a layer of frustration before you even get to the rest of the gameplay.     And then there's the voice acting. Oh boy. Shocking is the only word for it. 22 actors reprise their roles for the game, but you wouldn't know it based on their uneven performances. (Aside from Fred and George, who are probably the highlight). The sound-alikes fare even worse, with Harry and Hermione sounding just different   enough to consistently break any immersion, while Moaning Myrtle, who has - despite being one of the most annoying characters in the films - been elevated to a relatively prominent role, is like some kind of drunk caricature crossed with Gollum from The Lord of the Rings. Not good.Were not pretending that it would be easy to make an authentic game based on The Order of the Phoenix  it certainly wouldnt be, given that the book is less about fight scenes and Quidditch, and more about growing up and the injustices of the world. That said, this is still a rather lacklustre attempt, with run of the mill gameplay that weve seen before in countless other guises. Give it a miss and just read the book again.", "date": "Jun 28, 2007"}
