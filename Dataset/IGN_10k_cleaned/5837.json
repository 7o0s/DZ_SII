So when Superscape's Ivan ~Ironman~ Stewart Off-Road Racing 3D, we gobbled it right up and padded our cellphone bill immediately. We recommend that you do not do the same -- at least, not right away, as Ivan ~Ironman~ Stewart Off-Road Racing 3D doesn't offer much more than the other racers on the VCAST channel. Depending on if you've downloaded other games, your mileage may vary.   Ivan ~Ironman~ Stewart Off-Road Racing 3D is a 4x4 truck racing game that puts you in the cab of a rookie racer looking to earn his wheels and race as ~Ironman's~ partner. You must compete in a series of three cups -- plus a training mission -- to prove yourself championship-material. Any cup unlocked in this career mode can then be played in the accompanying arcade mode, which allows for quick races.   While kicking up mud around a series of curvy, bumpy tracks (there is no shortage of air opportunities), you must prevent your truck from taking too much damage. This isn't necessarily a cakewalk, as not only are walls easy to slide into when going around hairpins, but the other trucks on the track love to collide into you if you don't give them adequate room. Rubbin' may be racin', according to Robert Duvall, but with the damage meter on the bottom of the screen slowly filling up, you must drive somewhat cautiously to actually finish a race. Unless, of course, you pull into the lead right away and keep the competition strictly in the rear-view mirror.   Ivan ~Ironman~ Stewart Off-Road Racing 3D does a pretty decent job of ramping up the difficulty. The first cup, Junior, is pretty simple to win. However, things get a little tough in the Baja Open with more aggression on the track. The Protruck Series is certainly a challenge, but sometimes that's more due to the controls than the AI or track design. The controls just felt a little floaty. Sure, you're on dirt and mud, but some feeling of traction would be nice.   You can grab on-track power-ups during a race that grant turbo boosts or reduce damage. These are handy and helpful, and should be sought out whenever possible.   Now, as mentioned, Ivan ~Ironman~ Stewart Off-Road Racing 3D doesn't bring much new to the table. If you've downloaded, say, Asphalt: Urban GT, you played the best 3D racer on VCAST. But if you'd rather get dirty than slick, Ivan ~Ironman~ Stewart Off-Road Racing 3D might be more your speed.  Ivan ~Ironman~ Stewart Off-Road Racing 3D is a decent racer that makes no impact, but doesn't offend. If you want a racer from the VCAST channel, this is a good second pick. But that's not a ringing endorsement, either. I wanted the controls to be a lot better than they were, even if this was racing on loose dirt and mud. There's a big difference between challenge and frustrating, and Ivan ~Ironman~ Stewart Off-Road Racing 3D plants one tire in each category.", "date": "Jun 21, 2005"}
