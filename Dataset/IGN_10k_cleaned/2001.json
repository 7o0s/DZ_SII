Even an innovative game like Crimson Skies evoked a romantic vision of aerial combat that, even if it never really existed, certainly has a basis in fact. A flight sim that looks far into the future is rarer still. We're not counting the space games like Descent or Starlancer here; we're talking about atmospheric aeronautics.  Enter Echelon. Developed by Russia-based Buka Interactive and published by Bethesda, Echelon looks forward to an era of high-tech combat in the skies. Cool ship designs, an inventive flight model and some originality in the overall concept make Echelon a standout in the genre. Some poverty of design keeps the game from reaching the heights it should achieve however.  After a horrible civil war (there's always a civil war), humanity binds together in a Galactic Federation. Things are all sweet and prosperous until humanity discovers a new race among the stars, the Velians. You might expect the Velians to be all mean and oppressive but you'd be wrong. Instead the Velians offer the Galactic Federation the secrets of the new null-transport technology. The new tech is used to tie the various arms of the Federation together via special null-transport stations. One day the null transport stations spew out wave after wave of Velian fighters into the interior of the unsuspecting and unprotected Galactic Federation. That's where you enter the picture. Playing as a lowly cadet (and ex-civilian pilot) trying to fight off the invading Velians.  While it sounds great in synopsis form, the lack of any real narrative drive keeps you somewhat at a distance. The missions themselves lose a bit due to the lack of any interesting characters and some dull assignments. Along the way, you'll gain rank (and a little skill hopefully) that allows you a little more flexibility in choosing your loadout. Still, your involvement with the missions is pretty shallow.  The missions also vary pretty greatly in terms of difficultly. Some seem incredibly easy, while others are almost impossible. It seems that the missions where you're asked to blow something up are universally trouble-free. It's the missions where you have to keep things from blowing up that are the problem. Mostly it's that the convoys you're supposed to be protecting have no sense of self-preservation. If you could ask them to hold back for a minute or two while you blow up all the enemy missile tanks and air support, it wouldn't be as difficult. Instead, your transports will drive headlong into danger without the slightest regard for their own safety.  Having said that, when the action does heat-up, Echelon really delivers the goods. Combat is amazingly fun (although your wingmen seem to suffer from the same deathwish that plagues your convoys). The weapons are a helluva lot of fun to use and the traditional HUD display allows you to focus on the action in front of you without neglecting your overall situational awareness. Explosions are awesome to behold, and the damage model really lets you get a sense of the strength of your own skills. Better still the low engagement distances in Echelon keep you close enough to your enemy to see what you're doing to him.  Fifteen player flyable ships are at your disposal (although you have to earn the right to fly them during the campaign). The craft are remarkable in design and appearance. While most other games attempt to use the same sort of conventions when it comes to ship design, Echelon uses an approach that is at once both futuristic and utterly distinctive. Just look at some of the screens to see what I mean.  In terms of roles, the ships are much more predictable. Interceptors, heavy attack fighters and stealth planes supplement the basic fighters you start with. Overall, there's a real difference in performance between the various classes (and even within them in some cases), with heavy attack planes subject to greater inertia penalties due to their increased mass.  The flight model is refreshingly quirky. You still have the three basic axes of movement, but Echelon takes the middle road between traditional flight sims and less rigorous space combat sims. Although gravity and inertia are definite factors your craft can hover pretty easy and all but the most sluggish craft can turn on a dime. Stalls are pretty much non-existent but the momentum and drift associated with turning can sometimes lead you into crashes. This is mostly because the actual thrust line of your craft seems to trail behind the nose just a little bit while you're turning.  If you can find a video card that can handle it, Echelon becomes a very pretty game. Ship models and environmental effects are well done. I especially like the small dust trails that kick up behind your ship when you're flying at very low altitudes. Low altitude flight is what it's all about here and you'll spend lots of time flying through canyons or along the nap of the earth. Unfortunately the ground textures aren't all that amazing. There's a profound sameness to everything on the ground that just winds up being boring.  Once you've completed (or given up on) the missions, you're in for the real disappointment. The games instant action mode is remarkably one-dimensional. Although you can choose from any of the game's fifteen planes with whatever loadout you wish, there are only three missions to be flown here. That the encounters often end up playing out the same way each time is a testament to the inflexibility and tight scripting of the AI. After that you may want to try the multiplayer modes, but the lack of a decent server search feature hampers your efforts to bring more life to the title.  In all Echelon is a very welcome addition to the flight sim genre. It takes an approach that most other developers have neglected. Still, the execution and design aren't entirely up to the possibility of the concept. You'll play it, you'll enjoy and, ultimately, put it aside for more traditional games that offer a lot more sparkle.  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
