Needless to say, the room or improvement is just as, erm, rather ~grand.~   What's still kind of amazing about the whole motocross phenomenon is who started it. Who did it? Acclaim. Little does anyone know, but Acclaim is actually an experimenter, a risk-taker, and a company that has had many firsts. Take supercross, for instance. Acclaim brought the first game of this kind to the PlayStation, for whatever reason, they don't tell us these things, but man, Jeremy McGrath Supercross '98 sold like cherry snow cones on a hot summer day in New York. The success was so wild, the next year, THQ, EA, and 989 Studios all brought out motocross or supercross games, and at least in my opinion, only one of them did any good, THQ's Ricky Carmichael. (Acclaim actually took the year off and brought out its second McGrath game in 2000.)   Yep, supercross is Acclaim's baby, and could've, should've, would've continued to be it's baby, if not for, well, whatever. It just didn't happen ever again. Which brings me back to the unfortunate subject that is this year's Jeremy McGrath Supercross World. And as you may have speculated already, Supercross World is not up among the better Acclaim games (which include Extreme G3, Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX, All-Star Baseball, etc.). Nope, it's all about being right down there with Paris Dakar Rally and RC Revenge Pro. This game is a hapless, lifeless, and ultimately, an uninspiring game if I have ever seen one.   Gameplay What good supercross and motocross games have going for them, at least in my humble opinion, are a few things. First, they need to have a good sense of control, which means excellent speed, precise handling, instant response, and to straddle a fine line between arcade forgiveness with enough simulation realism to make the player feel like he's playing a game that at least fools him into believing it's ~realistic~ in some fashion or another. Well, Jeremy McGrath doesn't have A) a good sense of speed, B) very good handling, C) quick or even moderately quick response (with one exception, which I'll get to later), or D) any kind of chance at fooling you into your playing anything but a poorly developed videogame.   I mean, just for starters, the bikes ride like they're on another planet, with a different law of gravity. The bikes are incredibly floaty and stay up in the air for what seems like minutes. If you thought MX 2002 featuring Ricky Carmichael was floaty, this takes the cake. The basic control scheme works generally well, with L1 being pre-load, L2 and R2 being stunts, and R1 being powerslide, but the actual visceral, physical feeling of playing this game just makes me feel vacant. It's like Acclaim forgot to put the meat in between the hamburger buns. Remember that old Wendy's commercial with the old woman who wants a real burger, and she says to the fast food person at the take out window, ~Where's the beef?~ This game has no middle, it's empty, lifeless, totally a by-the-numbers product that just delivers an incredibly flat experience. It's not even Boca Burger status. Compared to this empty space between two white-bread buns, vegetarian burgers rock my world.   The preloading, which should be a matter of seconds to get to grips with, takes more like five minutes to get accustomed to, and even then you never feel that in the clutch, you're going to pull off a huge move when you need to. Linking Combos is not easy, and that's OK, but it's a bit of work, and it's more like work than fun. What I did enjoy were the assortment of goals in each race. Some, such as collecting skulls or helmets, are sort of fun, while the stunt goals and other random ones (clear trees, craters, etc.) keep players focused. These goals grow increasingly difficult near the middle and end of the game, and the game doesn't grow any more forgiving.   I did enjoy the wide-open spaces in Supercross World. They create a feel, open space to wander and explore. Neither MX Rider nor Ricky Carmichael delivered this kind of freedom in the actual races and I was glad to see that Acclaim took a little creative license in this area. With trails that are easily traceable, but not limited, bikers can find shortcuts, wild jumps, and some perilous drops, and if they're not careful, they may very well risk crashing in these latter areas. Acclaim's developers weren't always fair when they placed bikers back in the road (and before a jump). The bike placement is right before the jump, providing neither time nor space to make the jump properly, so players usually will bite it again, and lose valuable time.   The aerial moves themselves are a purely route, ho-hum set of moves that totally lack inspiration. I mean, yeah, you can pull off Can-Cans, Saran-Wraps, Supermans, Barrel rolls, and all told, about 35 moves, but none of them look at that impressive. I mean, they don't look like realistic, or even close to convincing. They look entirely like a mechanical videogame character is slowly, methodically performing a robotic stunt.   What we have here is a bare-bones shell of a supercross game. The features are there: players can enter into a quick single-player game, or go forth into a massive Career, or perhaps take on their buddies in a Two-player game for bragging rights. There is even a good mix of modes (Baja, Outdoor Motocross Nationals, Indoor Supercross and Stunt/Freestyle), but with the exception of Indoor Supercross, with its weird set of goals and collectible wrenches and whatnot, you'll instantly grow bored.   It seems that on the outside of this game, the cupcake as it were, everything looks generally tasty and delectable. But on the inside, where the cream filling is, there is a lacking, sort of rubbery taste that just sours the whole Hostess goodness. I've already talked about the essential control and the stunts, and what bums me out is that no matter where I turned to find some sort of goodness in this game, I was just let down. More modes with that same poor control just multiply the frustration, not the other way around.   Graphics If the gameplay wasn't good, you're not going to like its looks. Jeremy McGrath Supercross World looks like a high-res N64 game at best. The game is practically void of any kind of decent texturing, and the worst parts of the game are clearly the Baja areas, which are literally stripped-down, empty hills with little to no color, less than minimal textures and absolutely no visual stimulating object to look at, at all. This game doesn't look in any way, shape or form like a second wave PlayStation 2 game, except for the little bits of shimmering here, and some poor aliasing there.   The riders and their bikes are decent looking enough, with a modicum of detailed clothing, bike parts, and whatnot, but the levels are even more bare and uninteresting than MX Starring Ricky Carmichael, and that's not good.   There is almost no attention to detail. The wide-open spaces are nice, but there is nothing, or little to nothing, to decorate them. There is no noticeable dust kicking up after the bikes, no marks left on the grounds, no actual dust or dirt textures on the ground, which looks generally like smooth, sandy wrapping paper. But, again, just like the gameplay, this game is strictly a by-the-numbers affair that's totally uninspiring.   Sound For all of the gameplay and graphic bits I didn't like, the sound is a totally different thing. With the exception of the entirely par-for-the-course bike sounds, the music selection is surprisingly good.   The 12 songs in the game range from hardcore rock to punk to whatever else in between, but the songs are remarkably good. The list features The Supersuckers, The Hellacopters, Drowning Pool, Millencolin, Sevendust, Mudhoney, Lunatic Calm, Stuck Mojo, Vision of Disorder, Fenix TX, and two songs by Dry Kill Logic 1. I know nothing about these bands, but I have to say The Hellacopters, Drowning Pool, and Sevendust, and a few others in this selection rock.   The only other sound effects that are worth special note in my mind are the crashes, or bails. The screams of pain issuing from floundering bikers are absolutely hilarious. It's worth it just to crash to hear the range of moans and yelps they holler out. It's quite fun.    I have little to say about Jeremy McGrath's Supercross World that hasn't already been said. The game may pave the way for another game in the series in the future, but as it is, Supercross World is totally basic in every aspect, and does almost nothing worthwhile to encourage potential players to but it. With the exception of the wide-open courses, I can't recommend this game in any way. Jeremy McGrath's Supercross World doesn't play well, doesn't look good, and has little to offer anybody, and what remained the biggest problem in the end, is that it's just not fun.", "date": "Nov 27, 2001"}
