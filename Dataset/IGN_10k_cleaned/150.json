I have loved, like many of you, this game since I was a child. You can buy property, build houses, and if you're a dork like me, you still get excited every time you land on Chance or Community Chest. You can be the Banker and control the money. But the best part of Monopoly? Crushing your friend's income when they land on your hotel. There is no better feeling than bankrupting the ones closest to you.   Monopoly Here & Now is EA's fantastic cell phone version of this updated classic. The game is the same, but the names have been updated for today, and the tokens get a new look as well. Choose from a Hybrid car (cute), a dog, airplane, cup of coffee, cell phone, laptop, shoe or French fries. I miss the hat and battleship. Choose to play up to three other human or computer controlled opponents and off you go.   The board is how you remember it from the original. You can change the House Rules such as adding a cash award for landing on Free Parking, changing the number of houses required before purchasing a hotel, your starting cash, if you wish to double the salary for landing directly on Go!, and if you're given any properties at the start. The computer has three different modes of difficulty, though I couldn't really make any distinction between the three.   The properties all have new names. You no longer buy railroads, but airports instead. Park Place is now Fenway Park and Illinois Avenue is now Disney World. Utilities have changed from Electric Company and Water Works to Internet and Cell Phone Service. Going to jail, passing Go and Free Parking are still the same, although I'm not sure why they didn't change it to Valet Parking because I don't know of any free parking areas anymore in cities.   Chance and Community Chest cards have also been updated. Win money by being discovered as the next Hollywood star, winning the lottery or pay up if you have to support an opponent running for office. Property values have increased. You won't be paying $400 to buy Boardwalk, but you will pay $4 million for its updated version called Times Square.   Trading, auctioning, and looking at properties are simple and the interface is fantastic. I'm never confused as to who owns what properties and I have easy access to buying houses and seeing how much money I have left. Properties you have had to mortgage are grayed out so you can keep track of them. You can manually mortgage property if you're short on cash or have the computer do it for you which is a nice touch.   You can shoose between full, limited or no animations for the game. I chose full because the limited animations went by too quickly and I sometimes never knew where my computer opponent landed because his turn would be over too quickly. Holding down the center or OK button when it's the computer's (or your) turn moves the token along the board very quickly. You'll know when you've won when the computer piece leaves the board and falls over in defeat.Im totally hooked. This is the best cell phone version of Monopoly that Ive played and I wish my T-Mobile Dash was able to play it. Fans of Monopoly will not be disappointed. I never thought the computer played cheap and the graphics and sound were great. One small tip, dont give in to the computers trade offers; if you give him a Monopoly he will crush you unless you can build houses first.", "date": "Apr 10, 2008"}
