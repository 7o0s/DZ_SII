It was a great game then and it's a great game now. The only thing here is that unlike other retro arcade games, Namco's Ms. Pac-Man doesn't attempt to fluff up the original with wider screens or bad co-op attempts. It's just pure and simple Ms. Pac-Man.   Namco's recent release on Xbox Live Arcade returns with original code and all that it entails. The original code shows off the game's wild and challenging maps plus some of its more entertaining bugs (like passing through ghosts), the original music and sound effects, and all those great cutscenes! I didn't get to the 256 or even the 134th board, so I'm not sure if the original bugs still exist.    Nothing quite like eating ghosts and fruit for points. There are many versions of Ms. Pac-Man around, or rather, so many arcade games that permit arcade owners the ability to tweak the speed, one must wonder: Which is this? This is the original. Act 1 is reasonably paced; the ghosts speed up gradually on the first map, but they quickly ramp up in the second map, slowing down again on the third one. What this means is that if you were used to nabbing 100,000 points in some arcade, hold onto your horses, partner. This is not Super Alpha Ms. Pac-Man II Hyper Fighting. If you're good you'll make it past the first couple of maps and get about 40,000 points.   As I said before, this $5 purchase is a bare bones one. On the whole that's not an issue. A bunch of XBLA retro games have failed in their attempts to force a single-player game into a co-op situation or into a versus mode online and they've mostly failed. I prefer the original game; which is why the lack of a two-player option sucks. An option for two players, one that's available for all 5 ga-billion Ms. Pac-Man coin-op units across the globe seems like a simple addition. Why didn't Namco include it? You can tell Namco uses the original code because the screen shows an original two-player option, whereas the XBLA menu is missing a line where the two-player option would allow it. Namco simply erased the option on screen.   On further inspection, Namco's XBLA version of Pac-Man doesn't offer a two-player option either. Seems like one of the requirements for XBLA's business model mandates two-player versus or two-player co-op functionality online, and if the publisher chooses not to implement online functionality, then they simply eliminate the option altogether; which is what Namco did. Any way you look at it, a simple two-player option, even if they take turns online would have been fine. The only additions Namco made to this version is the addition of leader boards and Achievements. The Achievements are well placed, handing out a lot of simple and medium-level ones, and saving one or two tough ones. Have you ever tried for a perfect ghost game? Try eating all four ghosts for each power pellet, munching 16 in one level. That's 30 satisfying points.   Moving forward; on the graphics front, the simple visuals do their job. The primary colored ghosts don't look off-color or weird, Ms. Pac-Man is yellow and east dots in the proper fashion, and the maps are bright and fall in the correct order. Sonically, Ms. Pac-Man sounds just like it always did, with one weird little addition. When you get Achievements or switch menus you'll occasionally hear a little bubbly sound, which is a later addition.    The options menu permits standard tweaking. The default settings are customizable. For instance, the amount of lives can be upgraded beyond three, or the score at which extra lives are given can be changed too. Switching these prevents you from posting your score on the ranked boards, so that everyone plays on the same level, but it does help new players get to grips with this rather challenging title. The option to widen the screen is also offered.    In all, Ms. Pac-Man is a satisfying game. I've been hooked on it for years and my brother and I still have competitions for high scores. Younger players who haven't tried Ms. Pac-Man should understand that the biggest difference between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man is that the original, Pac-Man, only offers one map. You play the same one over and over again. Ms. Pac-Man has about 256 maps, 250 of which you'll never likely to see. It's also tough. But watching a really good player is impressive and encouraging. I hooked a few younger IGN staffers and they now love Ms. Pac-Man. And really, shouldn't everyone love Ms. Pac-Man?", "date": "Jan 11, 2007"}
