Bungie's pre-Halo classic, Marathon: Durandal, appeals to the former of the two groups, while the casual crowd gets Spyglass Board Games, a title which I refer to as ~Chess, Checkers, and Two Other Games You'll Never Play.~   Ever heard of Mancala or Reversi?  I sure hadn't, but as the responsibility of reviewing the Spyglass compilation fell into my lap, I was eager to learn.  Unfortunately, the How to Play guide provided little help in my quest for casual gaming knowledge.  Checkers doesn't require too much of an explanation, the guide for Chess is rather detailed, but Mancala and Reversi get around three paragraphs each.  Considering that most players probably won't be too familiar with those game types, it would have made more sense to include a bit more instruction on how these games are played.   While learning these two alien game types in Spyglass's single-player mode, I alleviated my frustration by switching to a friendly and familiar game of Checkers on-the-fly with a quick press of the X button.  When I grew bored with that, I jumped into Chess, moved a few pieces, then switched to Reversi and struggled with that.  On-the-fly switching also extends into unranked Xbox Live games, which makes hunting down friends a good idea, as game types can be changed when one player or the other grows tired of a particular game.   Of course, the rather obvious Achilles' heel to this useful mechanic manifests itself in the form of anonymous online opponents who decide to swap games simply because they aren't doing well in one type or another.  I started a game of Checkers with an opponent who apparently grew aggravated at my superior skills, so he switched to Reversi.  I didn't want to play Reversi, so I promptly switched back to Checkers.  He switched, then I switched, and so on until he grew annoyed enough to simply leave the game.  This trend continued with an assortment of other players until I finally decided that learning the ropes online, even in an unranked game, isn't feasible too often.  Fortunately, Ranked games require players to choose the one and only game type that the match will feature.   You'll have about as much fun as these two. Even those players who are willing to shell out their Microsoft Points for nothing but Chess and Checkers will find themselves disappointed with Spyglass's lack of pizzazz.  There are no extra challenges, no in-game tutorials with which to improve a player's skills. You pay for Chess and Checkers, and that's what you get.   As most gamers would probably guess, Spyglass doesn't feature much in terms of flashy aesthetics.  The available game types--Checkers, Chess, Reversi, and Mancala--are displayed on a background that can be one of several colors.  Different themes are available for each game's respective pieces, and all game boards can be rotated to a number of vantage points.  That's about it, and really, not much more is needed.  Checkers is still checkers, regardless of whether or not the board is green and black or blue and pink.   The Xbox Live Vision Camera's inclusion doesn't hold any surprises, either.  I found myself looking at players' faces, living rooms, pets, and I'm sure there are gamers out there who will choose to display objects most commonly seen on adult websites.  A number of filter effects such as color reversal, a wavy underwater-like effect, and a jail cell border can be applied and switched on a whim by pressing the Left and Right Bumpers, but there isn't a wide variety.  The camera's inclusion in Spyglass feels completely tacked on, probably so that the screen looks a bit fuller; without those tiny video boxes, the playing field would look quite bare, especially in rounds of Mancala.  In short, the camera works just fine; it just doesn't add anything to the game.  At least the camera can be disabled if the filter effects grow annoying (and some of them certainly will).  Unsurprisingly, the most common matches I found online revolved around Chess and Checkers, which is too bad, because Mancala and Reversi are a bit of fun once their rules are learned.  Even so, they're just not as familiar and commonplace as Spyglass's two dominant game types, so the deciding factor boils down to this: Are most casual gamers willing to pay 400 Microsoft Points (US$5) for Chess and Checkers?  Probably not.", "date": "Aug 1, 2007"}
