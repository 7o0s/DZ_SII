Even the most casual of Galaga fans knows the old trick -- you let the bug with the tractor beam swoop down, then purposefully allow it to steal away one of your fighters. You then use your next ship in reserve to attack that same bug, rescuing your captured craft, and watch triumphantly as it joins together with your active fighter to create a double-barreled blaster of alien-wasting justice. It was the pinnacle of achievement in Galaga -- but that was nothing. In Galaga '90, you can get a triple ship.   Galaga is a classic shooter from the golden age of arcades. Developed and published by Namco, the game was a follow-up to Galaxian, which was inspired by Space Invaders; and like those two games before it, Galaga was addictively fun. So addictive that it quickly was christened a classic, and sequels were sure to follow.   Galaga '90 is one of those sequels. It's a TurboGrafx port of the arcade game Galaga '88, and it's a good one. The game is a faithful recreation both of its original arcade form, and a worthy upgrade to the established Galaga formula -- because the foundation's the same, but there's much more to find and achieve. It's Galaga with depth.   The triple ship is its immediate draw. Always a dream of Galaga players, it couldn't be done in the original (the double shot version was the best you could get). Galaga '90, though, lets you choose to begin the game with the double ship already active if you want, and using the same classic tractor beam trick will quickly net you the new model, complete with its three cannons. The super ship is a destructive force, and almost a necessary one -- because the enemies have had upgrades this time around too.   The first few levels play out in classic Galaga style, with enemies swarming onto the screen and setting themselves into ranks above your fighter. But after a few rounds are cleared, the game does something new: it warps your ship through space to a new sector, and new enemies will be there to challenge you. Galaga '90 does a lot of mixing up with the set formula like that, even introducing some scrolling levels, asteroid obstacles that block your shots, and, ultimately, boss battles.    All the while, though, it never feels like a departure from Galaga tradition. The enemies' behavior, the familiarity of your ship's side-to-side controls and the classic arcade sound effects all stay consistent as you progress through the game, which now has an end goal to strive for. Namco's development team must have had fun creating this enhanced version of one of its classics, especially when the Galagan invaders start ~dancing~ in the game's bonus rounds.It's still a simple shooter, but Galaga '90 is addictively fun -- just like the first coin-op edition that hit the scene now 25 years ago. If you're going for one Galaga title for your retro collection, make it this one. There's no other way you'll be able to fly the triple ship!", "date": "Aug 7, 2007"}
