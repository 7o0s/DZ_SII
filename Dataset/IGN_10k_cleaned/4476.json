All one really needs to know about is that Heart of Darkness is an old school 2D platformer that holds its own. To many, Heart of Darkness is what gaming should be, as it holds many early 32-bit era principles and dynamics close to its, um, 'heart.'  The story is about an imaginative boy and his dog Whiskey, who disappears during a freak solar eclipse. Andy takes off to find the dog and the game launches him into a world that is so creative and wonderful Steven Speilberg wanted to make a movie out of it (yet another story that's been told many times. For those interested in these stories, see the two-part Heart of Darkness Interview in the Feature Section).   The platforming experience here is tremendous, because the puzzles and actions never repeat, and the worlds are vast and eccentric. But what really pushes you to complete the game is the compelling, well-paced storyline. Along the way, you'll meet friends who'll assist you and gain new skills required to master the later levels.For this puppy, I highly recommend taking a weekend and spending the two-day recess playing through Heart of Darkness. Created by a team of gamers who are giant movie fanatics, HOD has a phenomenal sense of what the French call 'cinematics.' To add to this sensation, the game really was made to experience like a movie, all in one go. Throughout the game, highly rendered movie sequences appear to propel the story and you along with it, and they are evocative, the way ET was when you were a kid, but maybe what's exceptional about the game are the finely detailed animation sequences and artwork. The amount of detail is phenomenal.On the downside of things, the learning curve can be tough for some. It's built around the primitive foundation of trial and error, a less-than-superior gaming philosophy that may test many folks' patience. If you've played Dragon's Lair, you'll recognize the gameplay immediately.I'm not a big fan of trial-and-error games, but I really liked HOD in the way I adore my favorite comic books or movies. It may be kinda old looking, or even corny, but I keep coming back, and loving it each time. For those who miss the fine art of 2D platforming, well, HOD has it in spades.", "date": "Sep 9, 1998"}
