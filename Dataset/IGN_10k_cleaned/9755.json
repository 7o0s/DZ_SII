You make your way to the foyer of the decadent mansion, head to the front door, determine that it's locked and you move on. Wait. Hold up a second there, chief. You're in mansion full of zombies, armed to the teeth, and you're telling me you're not going to blow the door off its hinges and make a break for it? You'd rather wander from room to room really slowly, putting yourself in immediate danger instead?    It must be another Resident Evil game.   It's true  the schlock silliness of man-versus-zombie-versus-doorknob presses onward in Capcom's Wii-wrangled reinvention of Resident Evil 0, 1 and 3. There are a few nods to Resident Evil 2 thrown in, as well as a whole new scenario, comprising the final chapters of the game. This time, you're stepping directly into the shoes of the heroes at the centre of these classic survival horror tales, using your remote light gun-style to spray brains across walls and blow giant holes in rabid dogs and giant bats and snakes. For fans who dabbled in the Resident Evil: Survivor series, it might feel eerily familiar, if slightly slower and definitely deeper and more interesting. In some ways, one of the better comparisons we can make is to the action-focussed gameplay of the bonus Mercenary Missions in Resident Evil 4, minus the freedom of movement and presented in first-person.   This is the kind of compilation that is perfect for non-RE players who have always been curious about the series' jumbled back-story; it's a best-bits blast-fest that forgoes the slower paced problem solving and tension building that has become a staple of the genre. That's mostly okay, given that this is actually a pretty darned good light gun game that really only does a few things, but mostly does them pretty well. It's not a true Resident Evil game, but it throws a lot of bones to fans.     Of these bones, the weapons, items and monsters are all directly lifted from the main series' releases  which is to be expected. Umbrella Chronicles lays out the RE saga in chronological order, starting with an explanation of the origins of the T-virus as it makes its way across the country on a contaminated train. In this chapter, you can set off with either the elflike Rebecca Chambers (voiced by someone who's been huffing helium by the sounds of things) or the dastardly loveable renegade Billy Coen. The game hints early on about branching paths and occasionally makes good on this, allowing you to choose which direction to head with a tap of the A button.   The game's shooting mechanic makes a solid argument for using the using the Wii Zapper shell. It's worth reminding non-Wii owners or fans of light gun games that the Wii uses a sensor bar. Basically, you're not looking down the sight at the TV, but rather aiming at the bar and moving the reticule on-screen like you would a mouse cursor. It works just fine and is nice and responsive, but it can take a little getting used to if you haven't used the Wii remote like this before. The B trigger on the underside of the remote is logically used for firing off your equipped weapon; the only real issue is, without using the Zapper's trigger, it can be tricky to quickly tap the button if you have a pistol or something similar equipped. Rapid fire and high-power weapons are much less of an issue, but by nature of the B trigger's firm action, you just never seem to be able to fire the thing fast enough.   Progressing through the main game makes this much less of an issue, as you can eventually earn stars (rewarded for outstanding performance in each stage) which can be used to upgrade your humble Samurai Edge 2 pistol into a weapon of devastating power. This process of upgrading is basically a streamlined version of item creation that fans of the series will recall. It doesn't extend to the manufacturing and blending of medicinal herbs though; instead, you can simply pick up stray potted herbs for an immediate health boost, or collect health vials that bring you back to life if you're KO'd  which will happen frequently if you're not an ace shot.   Grar. Corporate-zombie wants to sell you life insurance.  It's in the aiming that Umbrella Chronicles is a harsh mistress. It leaves a very small margin for error, and on Normal difficulty and above, enemies sap the life from you pretty quickly if you aren't channelling Annie Oakley. Your typical zombie has a few areas on its body that are receptive to damage. The head is the sweet-spot; a clean shot will create a quick, bright flash on impact and will generally remove its noggin with a splash of gore. But nailing specific regions such as these take a smooth, steady hand. There's a definite learning curve here, but after a while, you'll get a feel for it.   Things get more complicated when bullet-sponge Tyrants, agile and lanky Crimson Heads and swarms of Lickers start cropping up with frequency and in greater and greater numbers. While the pace of the game and your chosen character's movements can be erringly slow at times, many enemies (beyond the typical shambling, drooling zombie) are agile and travel in groups. When they start approaching from all sides, you'll understand why it's preferable to play this game with the nunchuk attached, so you can tweak your point of view with the control stick and quickly cycle through weapons with the C button.   For all of the simplicity the Wii remote provides, weapon selection during the heat of battle is a little fiddly in practice. You must either readjust your thumb from off the A button up to the D-pad, or use the C button to cycle to the next weapon. If you're running dangerously low on ammo, you really need to start planning ahead, or you'll be clicking an empty barrel. In boss battles, this couple of seconds of clunk can mean the difference between life and death; dying because of needing to swap out your weapon can be irritating enough to pull you out of the experience.    Learning your enemies' weak points becomes essential. The on-screen crosshairs give you a much-appreciated helping hand, flickering white when it passes over vital areas. It also flashes over destructible objects; it pays to use your sidearm's unlimited rounds to ventilate the environment as much as possible, since shooting light bulbs, pictures, windows and most inanimate objects yields fresh weapons, unlockable fact sheets, character bios, heath boosts and occasionally, an alternate path. It's actually in allowing you to interact with the environment like this that Umbrella Chronicles really sets itself apart from other on-rails shooters. Where most light gun shooters generally have static backgrounds or limited destructibility, Capcom lets you tear shit up. Equip a grenade launcher and lob a round inside one of the various decrepit genetic labs and you'll see what we mean.   We think it's this level of debris and interaction that is responsible for the muddy engine and simplified character models. While it's not a universal truth, environments taken from throughout the traditionally pre-rendered series really vary in textural and polygonal quality. Some wall textures are shockingly pixelated, given how prominent they are in the frame, and although we completely appreciate the authenticity of blasting out lights and then creeping down a near-pitch black hallway, the Wii's 480p resolution makes dark areas look really muddy.    Then again, there are times that the Wii shines, demonstrating oft-neglected power and technology that will surprise you. Heading outside and into the night, surfaces like stone walls and waterways flicker with high-quality bump-mapping, light blooming and excellent water effects. What's more, it's all presented in widescreen, and the extra screen real estate is essential for a shooter where so much is going on at all times. There's a small amount of slowdown, but the game generally handles firefights and numerous characters at a steady 30 frames per second, or thereabouts.   All this scene is missing is Michael Jackson with cool contact lenses.  The score and voice acting don't fare as well. That probably won't come as a shock to long time RE fans, but it's shocking how poor some of the lines come off, particularly considering that Resident Evil 4 wasn't too bad in this department. The soundtrack is offensively midi at worst, with synth keyboards and thrumming bass that actually detracts from the atmosphere at times. We'd prefer silence and subtlety over poorly realised music any day. While the infamous 'Jill sandwich' line doesn't actually make an appearance, there are plenty of hokey duds tossed in that make you question whether Capcom aren't intentionally futzing around with the dialogue to make the experience more like a B-movie. If so, they succeeded; it's unintentionally amusing and embarrassingly awful in equal measure.   The two player mode is a nice touch; being able to hop into a game and ramp up the difficulty makes the experience competitive and much more social. It's an entertaining game to watch on its own, but having a friend fill in the shoes of the second character is a lot of fun.    Impressively, there's a lot of gameplay (albeit repetitive) in Umbrella Chronicles. Each of the main chapters may take you upwards of an hour to progress through, depending on the difficulty. Finishing these and seeking out secret routes, fact sheets and so on will net you bonus side-missions starring Resident Evil regulars like Ada Wong, Wesker and HUNK. Without spoiling things, the very first of these extra missions, sticking you in Wesker's boots, gives you an excellent example of how the team behind the game have used these characters to fill in plot holes and flesh out the story arc even further. Wesker must backtrack through the level you've just played through, making his way through a slightly alternate path and giving the player a linear set of quasi-objectives to achieve.   Is this dialogue... wooden?  If it sounds like we've been mostly positive about this game, it's because we really do like it. It's good stuff. But it falls short of greatness in a few fundamental areas. While tight aiming and a learning curve are just fine, there are boss battles and indeed even standard enemy encounters that are literally hit and miss. You can be plugging away into enemies, nailing their specific weak points and the game just doesn't register the hits. This tends to occur most during times when the enemy is 'animating', such as when it's standing up, moving around or reacting to a hit.   More annoyingly, there are moments during certain encounters where some attacks are simply unavoidable. While most attacks can be stemmed with a well-placed round, there are times when your first encounter with an enemy is when they're swinging a tentacle into your face or dropping onto you from above without warning. Even when replaying these encounters, it's seemingly impossible not to take damage.   The presentation is a mixed bag; the CG sequences and moments of exposition are either recut from the original games, or are clunkily handled single screens of poorly acted text. You might not care, but for a game that tries hard to convince us of its legitimacy as a full strength, high quality Resident Evil adventure, things like this knock it down a peg and cheapen the experience.  Mostly, however, Umbrella Chronicles does a solid job. It takes repetitive rails-shooting gameplay and retreads a lot of arguably worn locations and Resident Evil territory, but it never feels stale. In fact, a degree of knowledge about the previous games not only helps the choppy storytelling to gel a little better, it also gives you a tactical advantage. You'll have a good idea of what key enemies you're going to encounter (and thus, when to save your grenades or heavy munitions), and secrets to keep an eye out for. In this way, Resident Evil fans are definitely encouraged to try their hand at Umbrella Chronicles. It comes close to greatness and definitely rounds out the much-needed hardcore gaming category on the Wii.", "date": "Dec 13, 2007"}
