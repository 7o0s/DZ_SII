It takes your mind off problems, you rely strictly on impulse and hand-eye coordination, and for a short period of time, you're free to beat up thugs on the street. That was what it was like to enter an arcade in the 1980s and early '90s. Side-scrollers, top-down beat-'em-ups, and shooters ruled the roost. Spikeout: Battle Street is a game that harkens back to simpler times, for better or for worse.   For $29.99, Spikeout: Battle Street isn't a bad buy. It's not a great purchase, given the amazingly retarded dialog, kindergarten-level mission designs, and monkey-brained AI, but buying it wouldn't be a huge mistake. The gratuitous feeling of pure button mashing is a relief, a welcome flashback in time to the land of sprites and repetitive blood curdling yelps of death from thugs whose lives weren't worth a rats ass in the first place. But the thrill doesn't last long, and the game is anything but deep. So no, Spikeout isn't a bad buy. But it's a better rental.    Gameplay  Sega's Spikeout is a 3D beat-'em-up in the old sense of the word. Taking its cue from the coin-ops games of old, especially Streets of Rage, Sega's SpikeOut gives you the chance to punch, kick, throw, and combine variations therein as wave after wave of enemies wait in line to fight. On the surface, the attacks are simplistic. Hit X enough times, and you'll witness a single punch transform into combos. Smash Y enough times, and your kick animates into double and triple kicks. You also have a throw button, A, which turns simple throws into combo attacks replete with collateral damage.    You could easily play Sega's actioner at this level and miss the slightly deeper attack combos beneath the surface (or if you read the manual, the moves are on page 3). Dig a little deeper and you'll find a slew of slightly in-depth attacks, special, homing, jump, and dash attacks, all of which add a nice layer of dynamics. The special throws, charge attacks, and combos create a more exciting and slightly more interesting beat-'em up than at first glance.   Unfortunately, there really isn't a third layer of depth. And calling the second set of attacks a ~second layer of depth~ is pushing it. Spikeout really is a coin-op game, one born from quarter-munching sensibilities and the most basic of designs. It's actually flabbergasting, shocking in a sense, to see a game appear in such an unadorned form. It's like finishing the construction of the Lego version of the Millennium Falcon, a rather complex model, and then returning to Lego's first set of building toys, replete with rectangles, squares, triangles, and circles. The 10 levels are formulaic, predictable, and after only, say two levels, the game feels worthless. To a degree, Spikeout's simplicity is wonderful, and then quite quickly, the game's shallow, uncomplicated nature renders absurd, mocking laughter. Why in God's name would anyone spend $29.99 for this?   Don't try this game at home. As a single-player game, Spikeout is a total wash. It takes no more than two to three hours to complete, and when the game does get tough and a boss does his job right, you'll yell in frustration because there are no save points. You die, you start over at the beginning. Sorry. It's old-school, for better or for worse. The only reason to play the single-player campaign is to open up new locations, characters, and specialty things. Otherwise, it's not worth your time or money.   The real value to this game is its online cooperative mode. Joining two to four players, a gang of gamers can team up to plunder through it in less than two hours. Online, it's twice as fun, but it's also twice as quick to complete. Yelling at friends, teaming up to beat bosses, clobbering dumb thugs, all of these things are way more enticing with fellow gamers, and Spikeout gives you that chance offline, via System Link, or online. Renting this game for a party would be a great idea. A short party, but still    Graphics and Sound  There is little to say about Spikeout's graphics or sound. So little I'm skipping the niceties. Spikeout is a simple-shaded, plainly textured world that's just short of ugly, but yet it's not terrible. It might be plain, dull, and unimaginative, but it's not terrible.   The game isn't a graphic failure because the designers didn't aim high enough for it to fall very far. It's just what it is: simplistic, dull looking, and wonky. Yes, wonky. Watch the enemies walk and run, listen to their dialog, watch the AI at ~work.~ If you beat the boss before his circle of thugs, they'll run away from you. They'll run into a wall, and then run as fast as they can against that wall, just to get away from you. Too bad they can't run through walls. Life would be easier on them. As it is, their legs move, but they don't. You can walk up to them, as they run against the wall, door, or car gate, and pummel them. They do react to that: They'll just run in some other direction.   This game is wonkier than Bozo the Clown taking a beating from Flipper at Leave it to Beaver's House during a Monopoly party with no Boardwalk. What that means I don't rightly know, but Spikeout is wonkier than that.SpikeOut: Street Battle a letdown, but not much of one. We didn't have very expectations in the first place. It's actually a fun, party game that you'd feel best renting -- not buying. It's not worth $30. Once you play it, you'll almost assuredly never play it again. The single-player mission, graphics, dialog, music, animation, AI, and level design are all so shockingly retro in all of the worst senses, that one wonders if this game weren't really designed about 20 years ago and just recently uncovered from some sort of lost chest of unwanted arcade titles that never got the green light. Rent this with friends who you know truly love you. Otherwise, save your $30.", "date": "Apr 5, 2005"}
