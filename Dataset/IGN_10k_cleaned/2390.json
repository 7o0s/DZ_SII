I'm happy to note that Rampage Puzzle Attack breaks the company's recent mold, as this title is Midway's first real quality product on the GBA. Sure, it's using the familiar Rampage beasts to sell a puzzle genre, but more power to them -- the puzzle design is great, simple fun with a ton of different modes to keep players going a long time. If this cartridge had battery save we wouldn't hesitate to put the game in the ~must have~ list. Features More than 200 different challenges Link cable support for two players (single cartridge link) Password save Only for Game Boy Advance  Game developers today can't release a puzzle game without having it compared to other puzzle games in the genre...and this habit's not going to stop with Rampage Puzzle Attack. The design is very similar in concept to Nintendo's Tetris Attack (also known as Panepon) and Capcom's love-it-or-hate-it Puzzle Fighter series. In Midway's take designed by Ninai Games, players swap six colored blocks within a horizontal line, two at a time...when you've got the two you want in play, it's a simple matter of pushing down on the D-pad to drop the two blocks into the waiting bin. Same colored blocks will connect with each other if they touch either on top or next to them, and the only way to remove these blocks from the bin is to drop an activation block of the same color...known as a Detoblock. More advanced players can learn to drop Detoblocks in play that will activate when the pieces below or next to them disappear, letting gravity take over and have them fall onto their proper color for a high-scoring combo move. If the bin of colored blocks rises to the top of the screen, the game is over. The Rampage characters are only here to give the game a bit of personality...they'll climb the side of your playfield and growl (with a fantastic digitized rumble, I might add) as you stack up your blocks into the bin.  Like most puzzle games, it's tough to get the concept from a few still screenshots, but believe me...the game design is extremely simple to understand and very pick-up-and-play friendly once you experience it in action.  And the developers injected a ton of variety into this concept with different play modes. The standard Clear Mode gives you the task of wiping clean the entire bin of colored blocks with an unlimited amount of moves. The Puzzle Mode features different configurations of bin blocks that must be removed in a limited number of turns.  And then Rescue Mode...oh, yeah, that's where the Rampage monsters come into play, since the challenge is to remove the blocks that rest atop a cage that's holding one of eight different mega-beasts, before the clock runs out. Of course, there's the standard Marathon Mode where you just continue to remove blocks from play until either your thumb falls off or you run out of room. This mode isn't as addictive as one would hope, since it's not very difficult to create simple moves and combos to remove all the blocks from play...and the design doesn't exactly rush you to play your moves. But the other challenges are well worth a look or two.  Even better, the developer incorporated these modes in a two player option through the use of the link cable and two GBA systems...and you only need one cartridge to take advantage of this option. Thumbs up to Ninai for figuring out how to put the GBA's download game link feature to use successfully. Keep it up. Rampage Puzzle Challege even takes advantage of several Game Boy Advance graphic techniques; even though they're completely arbitrary and unnecessary to the game's design, they add to the overall presentation and give the game a refined, polished look. I mean, is a transparent scrolling background of the city, with another layer of giant beasts really needed? How about the 3D rotating planet to show what level you're on? All this is definitely fluff, but the fluff in this case is a good thing...it shows that the developer knows the system enough to try cool effects. The music and sound effects are also good enough to note...though the sound takes a dive in two player mode (the music is non-existent), the tunes and digitized audio effects are of very high quality.  What's not a good thing is the choice to go with password save over battery save. It's a damn shame that we can't save our progress to cartridge, nor can we save our top scores or best combos or other elements that are actually tracked during gameplay. The 10-character alphabetic password only tracks the levels you've completed in the three modes of play. Had Midway spent the extra buck per cartridge, this game would have been pushed into the 9.0 score territory...a password to save progress is an absolute drag and limits the enjoyment...especially on a handheld since you can't simply flick on the system for a game or two before turning it off. You have to spend time to enter a password, then you have to spend time to write the new password down...if you have a piece of paper handy.  Rampage characters on a puzzle game. Hey, it actually works pretty well...and if it helps sell a few more games, then I'm all for it. But darn it, Midway, you screwed up a really awesome game by insisting on password save. That's a game killer right there...but this game is good enough on its own merits to recommend it to puzzle fans regardless. I think we have the makings of a new puzzle ~classic.~ Rampage Puzzle Attack is a great, simple design that definitely has potential for a future sequel or two.", "date": "Dec 14, 2001"}
