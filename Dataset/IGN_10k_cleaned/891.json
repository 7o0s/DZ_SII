While the company failed last year, it's back again with the latest game in its baseball series, Sammy Sosa High Heat Baseball 2001 for the PlayStation.   Gameplay Last year's edition of High Heat for the PlayStation was pretty much a laughing stock in all counts -- graphics, sound, and gameplay. However, things are a little better this year, at least in the gameplay department. As is the case with all baseball videogames, High Heat 2001 has the general play modes that fans have come to expect: Exhibition, Season, Playoff, Home Run Derby, and Player Edit.   The Player Edit feature is a bit different than the Create a Player option that is found in most other sports game because you're limited to the current set of ballplayers and can't make one completely from scratch. If you want to put yourself or a fictional character in the game, you'll have to do so by changing a current major leaguer.   In a game that seems aimed at the statistical and simulation purists, it really lacks some important player management features that should be standard in all sports games. The most significant is that player trades are limited to one-for-one deals and unless you set the two teams making the trade to human-controlled, the CPU can reject trades that it deems unfair. This proves to be a real hassle when trying to recreate trades that have happened in real-life, which is a very important to the majority of simulation fans. Furthermore, while the game's stat tracking is fairly decent (and doesn't erase the season stats once the playoffs start like in TP 2001), it pales in comparison to the stats offered in 989's MLB 2001.   The way the game plays will be greatly determined by the way that you've setup the game. High Heat can be tailored for everyone from beginners to the skilled veteran.  On the easiest settings, the game is basically dumbed down to the game at its simplest form, timing the swing to hit the ball and selecting the pitch; everything else is done for you. Unless you are truly a beginner or a two-year-old kid, stay away from this mode at all costs.   With the game's difficulty and simulation features jacked up, everything's in the control of the player. The batting interface is really simple and doesn't make use of any batting cursor's or meters that have become common in the majority of baseball videogames. Instead, the player must simply press the directional pad in the direction of the strike zone where the ball is thrown (high left, high middle, high right, outside, middle, inside, low outside, low middle, low inside). At the onset, judging the location of the pitch can be a bit tedious, but once you start learning the pace and movement of the different pitches, it becomes a much simpler task.   Assuming the guess pitch option is turned on, players can also try guessing the upcoming pitch by pressing the circle button and the directional pad in the direction of the pitch type that he thinks is coming. If you guess right, it'll mean a better hit, but if you're wrong it'll decrease your chances of getting good contact.   Once contact is made with the ball, you'll be introduced to the game's single greatest feature -- the ball physics. The flight of the ball off the bat in High Heat 2001 is far superior to its competitors on the PlayStation. There's a wide array of hits, from pop-ups, dinks, slow grounders, high bouncing groundballs, line drives, balls that hook foul, to towering home runs. On top of that, most hits that should be doubles result in doubles and so on. The only real exception is that there are way too many occurrences of players getting thrown out on hits to the right fielder (this doesn't happen as often as in MLB 2001, but still way too much).   At first look, the computer AI seems to be a step above both EA's and 989's games. The CPU-controlled fielders will generally throw to the correct base and won't do stupid things like trying to get the lead runner when it doesn't have a chance. The CPU batters will also work the count and even take walks if you don't throw strikes. But, upon further inspection, most players will find many exploitable holes in the CPU's AI that end up making it one of the game's worst assets.   The most prominent comes in the area of base running. If you take off from a base prematurely, instead of throwing behind you and getting you caught in a rundown, the CPU will throw the ball to the base ahead of you. Thus allowing you to return to the base without any fear of being thrown out. This little flaw makes base stealing simple for any and all players, regardless of his speed, because you can always get a good fast jump because there's no fear in getting picked off for jumping too early.   The other major AI flaw comes into play in situations when you have a runner on first and second. By correctly timing the movement of your base runners, you can easily manipulate the CPU's throws so that you can safely move the runner to second and/or get the runner from third to score.   Pitching is another facet of the game that is flawed by the game's less than stellar computer AI. While the CPU batter does show some patience and will take walks, it's still way too easy to strike out. Even with the game set to the MVP difficult, it's easy to accumulate phenomenal strike out totals by simple pitching sliders or curveballs to the low and away or low and inside corners.   With all of the negative things about the game being pointed out, it wouldn't be fair to forget to mention that the game excels in the area of fielding. In most other baseball videogames, fielding can be frustrating because the computer will get hits on plays that should be easy outs because of stupid things like the camera angle being too close making it difficult to field the ball or some other foolhardy reason. It usually becomes so frustrating that the player just turns on auto-fielding and just forgets about that aspect of the game. Aside from laziness, there's no reason to resort to auto-fielding in High Heat 2001.   Graphics Where do we start? Compared to the competition, Triple Play 2001 and MLB 2001, Sammy's game looks a few generations behind. While its 3D graphics couldn't be done on the 16-bit Genesis or Super Nintendo, most people would probably pick the cleaner and faster sprite-based graphics that the best baseball games on those systems produced over these any day.   The player models are limited to only two types of builds, normal or muscular, so the end result is that almost none of the players in the game accurately represent their real-life counterparts. What's more, the facial textures are mapped onto flat polygonal faces that make most of the ballplayers appear to be the work of some mad scientist's experiment gone horribly wrong. When you first see them, you'll either vomit in disgust or just start laughing. The repulsiveness doesn't even stop there. The torsos of the batters in their stances are all stretched out and look like they should be on a man that's seven or eight feet tall.   As if the pathetic player models weren't nauseating enough, the game also features unsightly, low-resolution background textures, overly pixilated crowds, and just a general lack of polygons creating a very blocky overall look to everything in the game. Its framerate isn't a problem, but it's obvious that the developers had to limit the game to just a few animations per player to have it run without slowdown. Let's not even talk about the fact that the bats are shaped like softball bats and not baseball bats.   Sound If it weren't for the horrid graphics, the sound would be the most disgusting aspect of the game. The simple audio effects, like the crack of the bat or the sounDespite the fact that the PC versions of High Heat Baseball have been considered among the best baseball games ever released, 3DO has failed to work that same magic on the consoles. It's really sad for a variety of reasons. Firstly, it shouldn't be too hard for them to port the game to the PlayStation with all of the important features in tact. Secondly, the PlayStation needs a really good baseball game more than it needs another 2D Castlevania. And despite the high ratings that they've been getting in most reviews, EA's TP 2001 and 989's MLB 2001 are both pretty mediocre games. The baseball scene on the PlayStation is flat out weak and Sammy Sosa High Heat 2001 doesn't do anything at all to change it.", "date": "Apr 25, 2000"}
