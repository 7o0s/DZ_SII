{"name": "We  Katamari", "name_review": "We &#9829; Katamari", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/15/we-katamari", "text": "Long before he drunkenly smashed the universe's stars into oblivion, the enigmatic King of the Cosmos was just a child -- a terribly abused child. So sad!   We know this because specific moments from his grace's youth are retold throughout Namco's quirky We Love Katamari. They include a scene in which the young king had to box a portly boy and another in which he happily motored about town in a chic convertible... So yeah, at least We Love Katamari STILL MAKES PERFECT SENSE.  I suppose I'm doomed to never know what the guitar playing apple's problem is, how the elk got on the windowsill, or why the superhero is saluting at the crocodile's birthday. Oh well.  Not understanding anything? Excellent! We're talking about lunacy, so what's there to understand?  The game is crazy. But this isn't to say the raging insanity that powers the space king and his prince's Katamari rolling adventure hurt the game at all. That game part of the game isn't the least bit bonkers. It's actually quite easy to understand. You have a ball that things stick to and you roll it over said things. Whoop. In that, and every other conceivable way, We Love Katamari is genuinely Katamari. But then it also doesn't represent the same distinctly lighthearted, original leap as its predecessor. Therein lies the problem.  Since we're talking nonsense, think of Katamari Damacy as a shouting redheaded naked person in desperate need of a hug (pictured below). This idea is wacky, but it's also exciting and original. We Love Katamari is the same shrieking redheaded thing that wants a hug, only it's got a pretty blue shirt on. See the pretty blue shirt? Now can you see how adding a touch of blue doesn't really change much? In any event, does it make the naked yelling person more entertaining, or less?  Katamari Damacy vs. We Love Katamari  More of the same good at a slightly elevated price isn't anything to disregard, especially considering the base game and all its cool is intact, but objective rolling simply isn't as exciting as it once was. Time limits and specific accumulation requirements are novel ideas, but when you've rolled up islands and clouds and entire planets, rolling fire along just isn't as appealing anymore.  There's also the problem of the cooperative mode, which by and large does not work at all. I held up on my pad. That was my job. Fellow PS2 editor Chris Roper steered our rolling ball of devouring insanity around and I held up. Whee. There wasn't anything to it. It's just there.   ~Oh!~ You'll say. ~There it is.~  If we're going to be crazily creative (in the way that says we're crazy), let's apply that to gameplay as well. Scuba kittens and rainbow headphones are fun, as are elk that stare wonderingly into bedrooms, but there could be more to the new gameplay devices. In cooperative mode, I could have been controlling a little Prince running atop the other's Katamari. I could have been trying to keep my balance while hitting things with a stick, or maybe baking some cookies. The point is that something other than ~hold up~ should have been thrown in. Since it wasn't...  We basically have Katamari Damacy again. ~Oh, there you are. I found you.~ We Love Katamari. We really do. It's good. It's like the second bar of Twix that comes in those lovely two bar packages (thank you, Mars Corporation). Katamari is a tasty treat like that. It's a warming, wonderful snack. But then it's the same sweet we just finished. And though we still adore it, we can't help but feel like more candy-coated Katamari will shake our teeth loose.A great game with personality, We Love Katamari will bring you a very familiar kind of joy, but it's just not any better than the first one and thus not quite as precious.", "date": "Sep 15, 2005"}
