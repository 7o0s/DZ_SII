With the number of Dreamcast users crying for more Resident Evil, Capcom, proving once again that the company loves you, has given Dreamcast owners several choices of survival horror.  And even though I dig redheads like Regina in Dino Crisis, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis for the Dreamcast is the better choice.  Despite having marginal improvements visually and only a handful of extra options, veteran RE players will enjoy a quick romp while those that have never played RE3 on the PlayStation will definitely welcome this title.  Obviously, gamers that have played the PlayStation version of this game will find little new that warrants purchase of the Dreamcast version.  I can't fault them for that reasoning; besides the upgraded visuals and added options, the game is exactly the same.  RE3: Nemesis takes place right after the events in the original Resident Evil where you control Jill Valentine.  Having immediately resigned from the S.T.A.R.S. team, Jill must escape Racoon City, as more zombies and mutated creatures ransack the city into a nightmarish world of terror that will eventually create the setting for Resident Evil 2.  Yes,  Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is more of a side story that takes place between Resident Evil 1 and 2 (crazy Capcom timelines).  So, escaping from the city filled with zombies seems like a no-brainer, eh?  Well, there's one slightly monstrous problem. Throughout the game, you'll be hunted by a giant creature known as Nemesis (hence, the title of the game).  Imagine ~Mr.X~ from Resident Evil 2 or a mutated Pro Bowl linebacker and you've basically got the idea.  Not only powerful, the Nemesis is very cunning and has all sorts of nasty attacks up his... er... skin.  It is this Nemesis that gives this game a kind of ~teen horror~ feel a la Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street, so it'll be a definite treat for first time RE3 players to enjoy this Dreamcast version.  As mentioned above, the power of the Dreamcast gives RE3: Nemesis a decent visual facelift.  Granted, we're not talking about anything that'll blow your mind away, but the character models are cleaner and the pre-rendered backgrounds look better for the most part.  There are certain backgrounds that haven't been improved and sometimes even look a bit worse than the PlayStation version's -- simply because of the higher resolution and sharper graphics.  This is especially true with blood and/or fire effects but they don't really affect the overall enjoyment of the game.  For the Dreamcast version, you're given a few extra options.  The one that I enjoy most (because I'm shallow like that) is the eight available costumes you can select at the beginning of the game.  Among my favorites is the cat suit (woof) and an exact replica of Regina's outfit from Dino Crisis.  The other major option is the availability of the mini-game, Mercenary Mode, right off the bat.  Select from three mercenaries as you try to reach the extraction point in two minutes.  Of course, zombies and other nasties will stand in your way, and thankfully, killing them will give you extra time.  And yes, that big balooka of a Nemesis will also make a few appearances.  Despite having played through the PlayStation version, I still thoroughly enjoyed Resident Evil 3: Nemesis on the Dreamcast.  The slightly newer look, added options, and all the classic RE gameplay are enough for me to recommend this game to expert RE players -- and those that have never played the PS version should really give this game a shot.  Now, the only problem is, what will you have Jill Valentine wear?  --Anthony ~The Real Hunk~ Chau, IGNDC I played through and beat the original Resident Evil -- several times, in fact. So I had my concerns about whether or not this GameCube remake, outstanding visual and audio presentations aside, would really be worth the effort again. The good news, though, is that it is. Even if Capcom had not changed a single gameplay-related element, Resident Evil remake would have been an amazing action-adventure -- spookier than ever before and totally worth the trip. But there are new additions, and lots of them, from the different mansion layouts to the new defensive moves, the new enemies, the gruesome original bosses and storyline extras, the 10 different endings, and so much more. The one thing that hasn't changed, my biggest complaint, is the control system. It's still digital for reasons unknown. You can use control 'Type C' so that characters can run and turn at the same time, a nice addition, but overall the control hasn't advanced much from the original. This is disappointing, of course, but it hardly ruins the experience. The play is still very fun and very challenging. Sometimes too challenging, perhaps. It's a hard game. You'll have to invest some time into it and indeed, on the most difficult setting, be prepared for some long nights. Capcom has extended the replay value of the adventure quite nicely, but in doing so has also included some rather troublesome gameplay mechanics and objectives, the biggest of which are the limiting inventory system, some of the out of whack puzzles which seem to make no sense, and some of the forced routes through the mansion. In some cases, doorknobs actually fall off doors so that you can't go back the same way you came in, forcing you to go around, and around, and around again.One of the many bloodthirsty zombies in the game.But if those are the drawbacks, sign me up. The graphics -- totally revamped, enhanced and tweaked -- are the prettiest on GameCube yet and indeed as of this game's release, the most impressive I've seen in any game on any console. Beautiful art mixes with outrageous technology for environments that look nearly photo realistic and yet animate accordingly too, cast shadows, and more. Characters, high polygon and wonderfully constructed, animate with an eerie realism, blood and bone particles splatter in a disgusting, too gruesome fashion, and every corner presents a new scare. The audio portion of the game is just as high in caliber, crisp and clear, allowing nightmarish moans and screams and everything in between. It's just a very complete package in this regard.So there are a couple of issues, sure. It's not a perfect game. But Resident Evil is easily the scariest, most atmospheric videogame I've very played. It's the only one I've ever been afraid to play alone. It's a triumph as a stand-alone adventure and a major accomplishment as a remake. Every gamer -- whether you've played the original or have never heard of the franchise -- should pick this up for their GameCube. It's one of the must-haves that you'll cherish not only as a truly fantastic, spooky videogame, but as a technical feat and prize that you can show your friends who still doubt the power and capabilities of Nintendo's next-generation console in the hands of the right developer.Stop reading now. Turn your computer off, buy this game, and enjoy. The wait is over.", "date": "Nov 22, 2000"}
