The smaller screen limits the size of the karts and drivers so you can see the track, but this infringes on the personality of a character-driven game. Limited memory often cuts down on the number of available tracks. And finally, controls make it tough to weave through crowded packs and powerslide around sharp turns while laying out a fat dose of acquired, goofball weapons.   Gameloft's Rayman Kart suffers from all of these platform-specific problems, but offsets them with some very clean and clever design choices. The result is a very playable and very colorful kart racer that easily secures the top spot of the category. With cellphone tech advancing at such high speeds, previous entries in the category -- even those that were well-reviewed, like Crash team Racing -- look like they are practically standing still compared to Rayman Kart.   The game follows the kart formula to the letter: Rayman and several characters from the franchise -- including the newest darlings, the Rabbids -- hop in their karts and hit a series of themed tracks, dishing out crazy weapons and hitting boosts to rocket around the competition. But the presentation and amount of content is truly top-notch. There is a ton of reward content in Rayman Kart, from the ability to unlock up to six racers, each with six different karts. If you choose Rayman, you start with a measly regular kart, but can earn enough points by winning races to drive the speedy Silver Bullet or the maxed-out 24 Karat. Each kart actually handles differently, so you always want to go back and see if you scored enough to trade up.   There are eight different worlds in Rayman Kart -- each world has four racing events. The easy race lets you scope out the track with a medium amount of aggression from the other racers. The heat in a hard race, plus some slight changes to track layout, really turns up the competition. A time attack mode gives you a ticker that refills after every completed lap. Finally, the Lum race places a specific number of collectible Lums on the track. You must pick up as many as possible and hold on to them through defensive measures. The second-place player must attack the leader to shake loose Lums. Completing one of these events above third place adds points to your purse. And alert screen lets you know when you have enough points to unlock a new kart, racer, or world.   As you race through the different tracks, such as a haunted graveyard with Frankenstein Rabbids or a water world complete with a whale's mouth tunnel, you can attack the other players with weapons like nukes that target the first-place racer and boxing gloves that stand in for Mario Kart's red shells. Each racer has a special weapon exclusive to them. Rayman turns into a fist and punches other players while rocketing up the pack. The Rabbid turns other players into slow Rabbids. Globbox leaves little walls of mini-Globboxes behind him.   The controls are good but not great, but a lot of that can be attributed to the platform. If you stick to the directional pad, you can just steer left and right, push up to jump, and press OK to fire off a weapon or use a boost. If you opt for the number pad, use 1 or 3 on sharper corners for powerslides. I tried using the number pad, but eventually just gave up and forgot about powerslides. Unlocking high-end karts gave me to speed to whip around corners well enough to score first place. Where's our analog nub, manufacturers?   I tested Rayman Kart on a Sony Ericcson w810i. The game looks excellent. Gameloft found just the right size for the karts. They are big enough that they definitely portray the mascot well, but not so big they obscure the view of the track. The track themes are nicely realized, especially the last three: Murky Swamp, Rabbid Battlefield, and Moonlight Pass. I harp on and on about color, but the right use of color can really make a game pop. Rayman Kart pops. Each world has its own musical theme, too, and none of them are duds. A couple of them would actually be great ringtones.  If you're looking for a lighthearted racer -- maybe Project Gotham Racing isn't your bag -- Rayman Kart is an excellent download. There is a lot of game here: 8 worlds, 16 tracks (that's more than Motorstorm!), 36 karts, and 6 racers. The visuals are strong for a 2D racer and the use of color is exceptional -- the game is very pleasing to look at and listen to. And the Rabbids are back, too. Other than some occasionally pesky controls, what's not to love?", "date": "Mar 20, 2007"}
