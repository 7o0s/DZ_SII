It seems that no matter what your platform of choice is, your chances of being inundated by the compendiums of Christmas Past increase as time wears on. Whether those early Atari 2600-era titles are your flavor or you prefer the revisited arcade omelets of yesteryear, one thing is for sure; These things are here to stay.  To be honest with you most of these collections have stunk. In fact, other than the superb Vampire Chronicle for Matching Service from a few months back, we have yet to see a collection worth having since the Saturn's day of Dungeons & Dragons, Phantasy Star, and Sonic the Hedgehog. Luckily for us, Sega has decided to pick up the ball right where they left off and come back at us with a taste of the old school!  The appropriately named Sega Smash Pack  Volume 1, is a lesson in how to make a collection of our favorite games from yesterday. Spread out amongst every genre you can think of, the twelve titles to be had in this particular disc are strong examples of why the Genesis was such a force in the days of 16-bit. Practically void of any weak link in the entire set, sit back and marvel at this fantastic lineup: Altered Beast Wise fwom yo gwave! How many times have we mentioned this one in our frolic down memory lane? The first and still one of the best titles in the Sega Genesis library, you can't go wrong with Altered Beast. The only thing that baffles me is why Sega just didn't port the entire arcade ROM over instead of the Genesis version, the space and technology is there. I'm curious though, was it always this easy? Columns Personally, I played more Puyo Puyo as a kid than Tetris, and when I went back to it after all these years I can see why. Faster paced, easier to look at, and audibly on par with just about any puzzle game you've seen so far, Columns shakes my world. This is probably the most replayable title of any game in the set. Golden Axe If you had a Genesis in the first two years of its existence and didn't have Golden Axe, then you were by definition, a lame-o. Tied with Final Fight as one of the most important side-scrolling beat-em-up's in history, the Axe has plenty of gameplay to go around. Of course, the same question I had with Altered Beast returns with this offering; Why no arcade ROM? Phantasy Star II Yes! The best reason to own the smash pack is right here baby! Sixty-plus hours of pure 16-bit RPG wizardry with a storyline to match, Phantasy Star II is still one of my favorite games of all time. The only real problem with this port is the soundtrack... what happened? Same great tunes, new garbled presentation. Revenge of Shinobi Though Shadow Dancer was a better game, Revenge of Shinobi still earns a much-deserved spot on the disc. Deeper than Tecmo's Ninja Gaiden and ultimately easier to get into, no other game can claim bragging rights to being able to fight Spider-Man and Godzilla in the same experience. Unfortunately, the sound effects and music are curiously more echoed here than they were on the Genesis. Sega Swirl You may remember this puzzler from our review last year. Kind of like a reverse Tetris, Swirl is the best next-generation puzzle game we've seen yet (and probably ever will see). The added email support is a hefty bonus! Shining Force This tactics-level RPG was cool light years before the whole Final Fantasy Tactics boom hit the states, and I can still see why. Less pretty than I remember it, the otherwise perfect cartoon-like epic is just as fun as it ever was. A great way to pass the time in between e-Bay searches for all three volumes of part three. Sonic the Hedgehog The game that changed everything; the way we played, the way we thought, and most of all, the way we looked at Sega. Incredibly fast even by today's standards, this is a classic in every sense of the word. Cursed by the strange sound ghost that haunts most of the other games though. Bummer. Streets of Rage 2 Fantastic side-scrolling battle game, and more fun than the original (although the inclusion of the first one would have been a nice touch), Streets of Rage 2 is all about the response time and your will to survive. Hook up with some friends and take it all the way home! Vectorman The last truly great Genesis game makes an appearance on the first truly great Genesis collection. Watching those little vectors move across the screen the way they do amazes me when I realize it was put together on a CPU weaker than our telephone's. Great platform fun! Virtua Cop 2 Way to easy when played by itself, buying the stand-alone import version couldn't be justified. As part of a set here however, it's much easier to forgive the all-right port of a great arcade game. Not the worst game in the world, it's a pretty solid addition and finally gives U.S. Dreamcast owners a reason to use their gun for something other than House of the Dead. Wrestle War I never had the chance to play this when I was a kid and though it's a pretty fun little game, I'm not sure why they included in such an exclusive set (especially for a first volume). Probably planted in there for all of today's wrestling fans, Wrestle War is a neat (if simple) stroll down yesterday's mat antics.  Mouth-watering checklist isn't it? Makes us wish that Sega had released Volumes 2 and 3 right afterward (the humanity!). Brought down by only one curious glitch (i.e., the sound synthesis sounds like it's being played through a gigantic tin can because of the boosted power and processing speed of the DC's sound chip), and appropriately priced (Free with the spanking new Dreamcast Smash Pack System, and set to be cheap as dirt when it hits retail in late March) there are more reasons to get your hands on Smash Pack  Volume 1 as soon as possible than not.  -- Jeremy Dunham, IGNDC I suppose you have to cut a little slack for the one individual programmer that was given the daunting task of porting three Genesis games to the distinctly different Game Boy Advance hardware. But only a little. It's obvious that this package needed to spend a little bit more time in the oven. It seems like Sonic Spinball's the only game that gets through the porting process nearly unscathed, but because the original Genesis game wasn't exactly a top-notch Sega offering back in the day, the GBA port doesn't exactly sell Sega Smash Pack on its own merits. Golden Axe is even sloppier on the GBA than it was on the Genesis, with easy-to-exploit gameplay issues as well as completely unfair enemy attacks. Ecco the Dolphin's probably the strongest game in the trio, since it's still a very unique adventure even to today's standards. But as an entire package, Sega Smash Pack is a letdown, especially in its presentation.", "date": "Feb 10, 2001"}
