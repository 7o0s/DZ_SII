It's hockey taken to the utmost extreme and because of this, its appeal will likely lie more with fans of arcade action games more than diehard hockey fanatics.  Gameplay The game is set up just like Midway's other arcade sports titles, with the ability to select initials to store your records under and the like. However, with Hitz the developers at Black Box have seen fit to go ahead and include more features in the game than you'll likely ever find in another product of this kind. In addition to the Exhibition and Championship modes, there's an all-new Franchise mode that allows the user to take a created team through a set of 50 opponents to try and vie for the Midway Cup.   What's more, winning games in each mode -- Exhibition, Championship, and Franchise -- will earn the player either credits or attribute points. The credits can then be used in the Hockey Shop to buy and unlock authentic jerseys, fantasy stadiums, new player heads, and hidden teams, while the attribute points are used to upgrade the skills of your created player or players. Additionally, there's a cool new Skills play mode that lets the user compete in mini-games that tests his skills at tasks like stealing the puck, skating, performing one-timers and winning face-offs.  Once you get on the ice, you can expect gameplay that feels similar to previous completely arcade-style hockey efforts like EA's NHL Rock The Rink (one of the inspirations for the EA Sports Big brand) and Midway's old Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey series. Each team has three forwards and a goalie, the rink is smaller than normal, and the game plays really fast. The nature of having 3-on-3 play leads to a lot of breakaways and scoring will obviously be higher than you'll get in more sim-geared hockey games.   The AI puts up a lot of challenge, especially when the difficulty is set to the max, but it seems to be more based on the computer cheating than getting more intelligent. Even after you've come to discover all of the ways to score a goal, which will primarily be one-timers and wrap arounds, the computer will usually stay close as goals will just go in when you build any sort of a lead because of the CPU catch-up that's obviously on. Because of this, the game's single player experience will most likely tire on you rather quickly as the games begin to all feel exactly the same and often times out of your control, even when you're constantly winning. After a few days, the only reason to keep playing the game by yourself is to open up the stuff in the Hockey Shop and to build up the attributes of your created players.  As a result, if you're primarily going to be playing the game alone, then there's very little reason to fork over the money for the game. On the other hand, NHL Hitz is an enormously fun to play multiplayer game. Because the game is really easy to pick up and play even for those that might have never played a videogame hockey title before, it's one of those games that are perfect for pulling out when you have a group of friends over to play games all day.  Not only does it support up to six players if you have a Multitap, but the game's over-the-top style really lends itself to situations where you have a group of rowdy guys together in a room. There are a ton of big hits and it's fairly common to see a guy get knocked through the glass and out of the rink or have his helmet knocked off and kicked around, and as you would expect, this is about a million times more rewarding when you do something like this against a friend than the computer.  The game also features one of the best, if not the very best, fighting engine that has ever been used in a hockey game. You have a strong and weak punch, a block button, a grab and the ability to dodge and weave. And while it still lends itself to a lot of button mashing, the fluid fighting movements and ability to string together punch combinations while dodging or block the attacks of the opponent, really makes for exciting fights. And to top things off, the player that loses the fight is out for the game so it's very important to win your fights because you won't want to lose a key player when there's still a lot of time left in the game.  Graphics The fact that there are only eight total players on the ice to worry about (six forwards, two goalies) might have a lot to do with it, but the visuals in NHL Hitz are pretty damn tight. The player models are highly detailed, the mesh of the jerseys look nice, the numbers, logos and names on the backs of the player are clear, and the animation is usually nice and fluid.   Likewise, the various rinks, especially the secret ones such as the Shark Tank and the Coast, are filled lots of cool objects in the backgrounds and are tremendously detailed. The ice surface looks good and shows wear and tear as the game progresses, there are a ton of excellent lighting and special effects, the crowd is animated and completely modeled in 3D, and the players cast shadows and reflect on the ice.  There are some downsides to the game's graphics, though. While the framerate is pretty steady, it doesn't seem to be that high -- it's possible that it's locked at 30, but it just seems lower. And while the animation is generally fluid, there doesn't seem to be enough variety in player animations as you'll see pretty much all that each player can do just after the first game or two. Last but not least, the player reflections on the ice only show the bottom half of their legs and not their whole bodies. Minor problems in what is an otherwise great looking hockey game.  Sound If you've played any of Midway's arcade sports titles, whether NBA Showtime or NFL Blitz, then you pretty much know what to expect from the audio here in NHL Hitz. The announcer is extremely excitable and yells most of what he says, which is often limited to just the player's name or nickname when a created player is used. There's not too much to the commentary beyond this.  The sound effect are also very reminiscent of the company's other sports effort, as everything from the sound made when making menu selections to the way the crowd sounds will be familiar to anyone how has played a Midway sports game. Is this a bad thing? No. This is the way that arcade hockey should sound like.   As far as the game's music is concerned, it features a nice mix of punk, rock, and techno music that can be played in the background. The punk songs include Drop 'Em, Grinder, and Heads Up, the rock tracks are Make Me Bad, Rollin, and Scar, and the techno beats include Mouthguard, Ripper, and Street. All of the music, whether it's something you personally like or dislike, does fit well with the style of the game. If I were to have reviewed NHL Hitz 20-02 after my first couple of days with the game, it probably would have received at least a point or more higher. It's a great ~pick up and play~ game and is a whole lot of fun when you first get into it. However, the more time I put into it, the less and less I enjoyed it. While this might be what happens with any game over time, one shouldn't reach this point in the first week that you have a game, especially if it's a sports game. Much like many other arcade-styled sports videogames, Hitz simply lacks the long-term depth that's offered up by its sim counterparts. It's definitely worth renting and if you want a game to have around for whenever a bunch of friends come over, it's something that you might even consider purchasing because it is a highly enjoyable multiplayer game.", "date": "Sep 25, 2001"}
