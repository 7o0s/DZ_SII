This week, another blockbuster series bowed on the smallest screen: Fight Night. Subtitled Round 3, EA Mobile's brawler is the exact opposite of this summer's superlative Super KO Boxing. Eschewing arcade-y and casual-friendly trappings, Round 3 is pure hardcore sim. This game is not for the weak of thumbs, as your digits are put through the wringer against a series of amazingly detailed boxers. This will likely not ensnare the download dollars of the Tower Bloxx and Tetris crowd, but traditional vidders will definitely be impressed by the game's depth.   Played on an LG VX8100 and VX8300, Fight Night Round 3 is a stunner. The game features some beautiful boxer models, wrapped in detailed textures. Each hulking frame employs excellent animations which are extremely important for making haymakers and uppercuts land with impact both inside and outside the game screen. A haymaker has a pretty lengthy animation, as your boxer slowly draws back for a wicked punch, but when successful follow-through occurs -- damn. Blood and sweat effects cue you to the ferocity of your blow. I talk a lot about use of color for a reason; I think it's half the battle when creating graphics. The skin tones in Round 3 are spot on. The bright shorts and gloves pop off the screen. On a visual level, Round 3 is one of the best-looking 3D mobile games I have seen since Gameloft's Brothers in Arms.   But how it plays is certainly a weightier issue than visuals, and Fight Night Round 3 offers complex mechanics that take ample practice to master. The game opens with a forced tutorial -- something I would normally loathe, but is an absolute necessity in Round 3. Without it, you'd be lost. There are many, many moves mapped to both the number keys and the thumb pad. Pressing up and down on the thumb pad raises and lowers your arms for guarding, while the OK key throws some basic combo punches, like jabs. To really tenderize meat, you have to wrap your fingers around the number keys. Uppercuts are assigned to 1, high hooks to 3, gutbusters to 7, and a low hook to 9. Using these when your arms are in the right positions is important. Just jamming on the keys gets you nowhere fast -- this is no button-masher. And there's more, too. You can clinch with 0, which adds a whole new dynamic to the game. Getting in close and grabbing on to catch your breath is required in later bouts. Each boxer also has an illegal move mapped to #, like a head butt that is as risky to use as it is lethal. If ~caught~ by the ref, the fight is over. You cannot ever see the ref, so there isn't a lot of strategy knowing when to use it -- reserve it for fights that look like lost causes.   If the above sounds too complicated, then don't bother downloading the game. Because there's more to it than just complex control schemes. You need to keep training your custom boxer (a solid toolbox is included) between fights to earn stat boosts. Upping your power and stamina will make your boxer an absolute bruiser, but you may sacrifice speed by doing so. You don't have to indulge in the training exercises manually if you're a busy person. You can automate them, but you miss out on really fine-tuning your fighter. And these stats really do matter. I went for a brawny fighter and increased power. Every landed gutbuster really did a number on my opponents.   When you first start the game, you are a no-name fighter and the bottom of the ranks. The goal is to work your way through the initial series of palookas, earning enough respect and clout to challenge champions. If forging a career has no appeal, you can use the Quick Fight option to step into the ring with real world fighters, like Oscar de la Hoya, Bernard Hopkins, and Roy Jones Jr. Their digital avatars are fantastic -- excellent face work.   However, there is so much going on in Fight Night Round 3 that I found myself wishing EA Mobile had remembered that this is indeed a cell phone game and included a scheme for less-than-hardcore players. I think there is significant risk for disappointment from the inexperienced mobile gamer that buys based on the known brand and then discovers a game that requires number pad diligence and patience for mastering the complex controls. But what Fight Night Round 3 does, it does quite well.   11-30-06 Note: According to EA Mobile, Fight Night can indeed be played with one hand. The length of holding down the OK key determines the kind of punch thrown, from regular jab to a gutbuster. I tried this out and while it technically works, it's not the best way to play the game. Definitely stick to the thumb pad/number key combo to get the most out of the game.  What this all adds up is a serious package for fight fans. You have a complex control scheme that gives you access to some devastating small-screen fight action. I think this emphasis on hardcore mechanics reduces Fight Night's reach to a mere sliver of the mobile gaming audience, though. I respect and understand the point of the Fight Night franchise, but I hoped EA Mobile would include some sort of option for the casual-minded. I guess that's what Super KO Boxing is for. So, the 8.0 score you see is really meant for those with iron thumbs and prefer sim-style boxing over arcade action. But if you like it casual, definitely look elsewhere.", "date": "Nov 30, 2006"}
