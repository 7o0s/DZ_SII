We gathered a bunch of beer, some sleeping bags and other basic necessities, warned our significant others about the impending release of the game and prepared for what was sure to be a knockdown drag-out play-fest that would keep us up for at least a week. Boy, were we wrong. Mob Rule is an almost perfect example of how a great idea can turn into a bad (at best) game. I'm going to take the next few minutes of your life to try and tell you what went wrong.  If you haven't been following the game, Mob Rule is a building/strategy game that put you in the shoes of a Prohibition Era gangster trying to take over progressively more populous towns. To do this, you've got to buy land, build businesses on that land, and then use those businesses to generate the manpower and cash that you'll need to further expand. Now just to keep thing interesting, there's another (at least another, there may be several) mob boss trying to expand his stake in the city at the same time. If you want to win, you'll need to be savvy enough to build up your empire and kill off (or otherwise pacify) the opposition while staying out of trouble with the law. Sound like fun? We thought so too...  The first tip we had that Mob Rule wasn't going to be all it was cracked up to be is when we each started up the tutorial. Normally when a game comes in, one of us plows through the tutorial and then explains the basics to everyone else, but that wasn't an option here. You see, Mob Rule forces you to play all the way through the tutorial to get access to the rest of the game. I really, really hate having my access limited to a game that I purchased, but that's not really the biggest problem here. You see, Mob Rule's tutorial doesn't work all the time. It took me three days to actually get through all of the tutorial missions and gain access to the regular game (and multiplayer, did I mention that you can't even play multiplayer without finishing the tutorial?) because of the game's occasional failure to notice that I had completed all of the tasks it had set before me. By the time I finished loading up a saved game, playing through a tutorial mission, having it crap out on me, loading it up again, having it crap out on me again, and so on, I didn't want to play the damn game anyway. Unfortunately, that's my job, and so I plowed on heroically (feeling sorry for me yet?) hoping to find some joy after my frustrating introduction to the game.  It's not that I don't understand why the developers wanted to make you play through the whole tutorial though, Mob Rule is a pretty complex game with lots of different characters and strategies to figure out. When the game opens, you'll have access to only one type of unit - the basic Worker. Workers can be used to build new structures, work in factories and to carry heavy things. While they can be used to fight if you're in a pinch, odds are that they're going to get their butts kicked by just about anyone who tangles with them. New Workers can be bred in several of the buildings you can construct in the game, as can the Tenants who are necessary to run those buildings. From your HQ, you can convert your Workers into Fixers, your first specialty unit. Fixers are really, really useful - they can fight pretty well (okay, not that well, but a hell of a lot better than Workers), they can repair damage to your buildings (which is very expensive to hire out for), and they can take over enemy properties. Once you're ready to expand a little bit, you'll need muscle in the form of the Gangster. Gangsters are the real heavy hitters of the game and take an increasing number of worker to build each time you create one. These murderous henchmen start the game armed with a knife and get access to weapons upgrades as they gain experience. Using these three unit types, you proceed with the game, building new structures, taking over enemy structures and rubbing out anyone who tries to stop you.  While this might have been quite enough, Studio 3, the game's developers, have also added a great number of background problems for you to deal with as well. In addition to dealing with enemies, you'll also have to watch out for the police, who will raid your buildings (which shuts them down for a short time) and arrest anyone they see committing a blatant crime. Those who are caught will remain in the town jail for the rest of their sentence, which can be brutal, if you don't have the resources to create a replacement. Other threats include Hookers, who can distract the people in your neighborhood, Ghosts, who can scare your residents or cloak the movement of your enemies, Saboteurs, who can make bomb that will level your buildings and Bruto, a psycho who destroys anything that gets in his way. If you're careful in your dealings with this crew though, you may get access to their help, which will give you an edge in any assault on your enemies.  In addition to keeping up with all of these different personalities, you'll also need to keep track of a whole bunch of different objects, which you manufacture in order to improve the quality of your different businesses. There's a whole bunch of these things, so I'm going to just mention a couple here. First off, you've got trees, which you manufacture in your Gadget Factory. While trees may not seem all that important to a gangster game, they actually cover up what's going on in your businesses which in turn keeps the police from being as interested in what's going on there. Next up are Subway Stations, which not only keep local Tenants happy, but also allow your henchmen to move around the city faster. Telephones are also a big plus, as they automatically inform your henchmen when anyone is attacking a building. Other items like Ovens (which are used to upgrade your Soup Kitchens to Restaurants) and Stills (which are used to upgrade your Drinking Dens to Breweries) are used to upgrade your current properties into better quality establishments that can command higher rents.  Okay, all of this complexity would be fine if it actually led to a better gameplay experience, but it just doesn't. For the most part, Mob Rule plays like a low quality SimCity (less buildings, no traffic, and so on) but one in which your buildings are constantly threatened by destruction. While I would be all for this, the actions you take in the game are actually ridiculously repetitive with small changes in the pattern occurring only when you have to stop one of the aforementioned other threats. Basically it goes like this  you build new buildings until you get low on cash, when you do, you go and capture enemy buildings until you have some more cash. Anytime anyone screws with you, you send a gangster after them. With all of the possibilities presented by the business of making, protecting and distributing illegal booze, it surprises me a great deal that this game never really advances far beyond generating three different types of sims to beat the hell out of each other. This simplicity of concept also bleeds into the game's multiplayer game which, despite being very excited about it in advance, turned out to bore the crap out of all four of us.   There's other things wrong here as well. While Mob Rule has some fairly nice graphics, the game's sound is simply horrible. Every time I played (yes, I have a Soundblaster compatible card) I got horrible MIDI screwups in which the game's already awful soundtrack would be played out by the wrong sound effect. Sometimes I got horns, sometimes I got organs, and sometimes I got something that sounded like steam ejecting from the ground. I also had a sound error that would pop up every few plays in which a single note would play and then persist until I turned off my computer. This is really irritating, not just to me, but to my deskmate Steve, who threatened bodily harm to both me and certain developers if I didn't turn my speakers off.  Mob Rule is a really good idea. I love SimCity and other building games, and I love the idea of trying to incorporate more gameplay options into the genre. Unfortunately, the game just never lives up to what I, and the rest of the crew, expected of it. At best it's redundant, at worst it's frustrating and pointless. That's not what I'm looking for in my gameplay experience. Maybe I'll just go camping instead...  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Sep 17, 1999"}
