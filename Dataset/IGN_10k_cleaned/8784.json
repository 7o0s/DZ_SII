New licensed releases anyway. It seems like every fresh title hitting the shelves in Game Boy's final days is a cartoon brand or film tie-in  and that's the case here, with Ratatouille. Developed by Helixe and published by THQ, Ratatouille makes playable the tale of Disney and PIXAR's latest animated feature, the story of a Parisian rodent named Remy who dreams of becoming a chef. And while this adventure may not be exciting enough to draw back players who've already moved on to other hardware, it is a solid and entertaining experience for younger gamers, or those still proudly playing a GBA as their primary portable.    Remy's tale unfolds in France, and takes the form of a side-scrolling, platforming fetch quest  this rat's after ingredients. Fresh carrots and tomatoes. Juicy lemons. Exotic spices. Remy needs them all, if his latest kitchen creations are to be excellent enough to please the palettes of pretentious Parisians. He'll run, jump, climb and crawl his way through a variety of environments to find the fragrant foodstuffs, following his nose to locate the most well hidden items.    Control and animation are spot-on for Remy. His abilities are many, and his poses flow fluidly from one to the next  he can run on all fours, double jump through the air, land on a thin ledge and hang from its edge precariously, and every action feels natural. This rat can even wall jump, Ninja Gaiden style, and that's just plain stylish to see.    Each of his many maneuvers is necessary, too, to navigate the multi-tiered, labyrinthine levels. Stage design is the enemy in Ratatouille  stage design, and the clock. There aren't really any bad guys to encounter and defeat. Rather, it's a race against time to explore each area and find the right path of platforms, ropes and jumps to take to find each hidden ingredient.       The side-scrolling sequences and countdown clock take a break every once in a while, when Remy enters an interior area like a sewer pipe or mouse hole. Inside, the perspective becomes top-down, and the action focus switches to puzzle play. Remy can push and pull objects, trigger switches, wield limited weapons (like a little plastic sword) and activate his keen sense of smell all in this mode  the latter helps you home in on hidden foods by making trackable odors visible to the eye for a few moments. These dungeon-like portions of play are a welcome addition to the overall design  swapping back and forth between viewpoints extends the interest in both halves of the experience.    After all the fetching's done and the groceries have been gathered, Ratatouille wraps things up with a simple but effective cooking mini-game. In it, you move three pots full of boiling dishes around on a three-burner stove, adding ingredients and monitoring each pot's temperature so that none of the food gets too charred. For a bit more added depth, too, there's an unlockable image gallery that you can populate with PIXAR pictures as you find stars scattered throughout the side-scrolling stages.Ratatouille on the Game Boy Advance is a fine final course on Nintendo's last-gen handheld. The Game Boy brand will likely still keep itself just slightly alive throughout the rest of the year on a diet of more licensed movie tie-in games like this one, while few people even remain to be paying attention  but those gamers still powering on their SPs and Micros would do well to take a look at this impressively animated, solidly fun quest to find the finest food in France.", "date": "Jul 18, 2007"}
