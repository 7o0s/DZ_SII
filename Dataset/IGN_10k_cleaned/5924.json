{"name": "Poppit!", "name_review": "Poppit!", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/08/12/poppit", "text": "ranks among the most popular games on Pogo.com's website with thousands upon thousands of players using it as their primary vehicle for generating prize-winning tokens. It's appeal is undeniable -- Poppit! is one of those basic color cannon games (not unlike <i <Bust-A-Move that spring eternal on handsets and the casual games portals on the PC for a reason. This handset edition of Poppit! is a little behind the presentation curve from its PC parent, but the game play remains unaffected in the transition, which is what is truly important.  The formula is this: There is a collection of colored balloons at the top of the screen which can be popped by firing a like-colored balloon into its midst. If a balloon touches two or more like-colored balloon, they pop and if there is a balloon wearing sunglasses in the ill-fated bunch, the sunglasses either tumble to the bottom for a bonus, or they cascade down to the next surviving balloon. You have to get those sunglasses to fall if you want to rack up the highest score and earn the most tokens.  After every game, you are awarded coveted tokens. These token can be used to enter special drawings for cash prizes on the Pogo.com site, which links up directly with your handset. If you already have a Pogo.com account, you can add your mobile tokens to your already sizeable bank.  Poppit! is a cute little game, but it's certainly not flashy. The colors are bright and the little sound effects are totally un-offensive. Poppit! ranks as my second favorite of the first three Pogo.com games. It's a breeze to start playing, but when I wanted to stop, I was able to avoid that torrid ~one more game~ trap with ease. Of course, if you are a total token hound, the case may be different for you. Poppit! is worth a download if you like these breed of casual puzzler, mainly because it dangles a little coin at the end of the rainbow.", "date": "Aug 12, 2005"}
