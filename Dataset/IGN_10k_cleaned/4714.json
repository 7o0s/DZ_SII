However, be on the lookout for games based on old film franchises, too, such as SkyZone and Anthem Mobile's Rocky Boxing. Sure, it's aging series, but it's a known name -- and with crowded decks, a recognizable brand will get you noticed and downloaded.   Features:   Training mode  String punches into devastating combos  Fight Apollo, Clubber, and Drago   We noticed Rocky Boxing because of the name brand, and were prompted to download it ourselves. (Hey, we're consumers, too.) Consider us your mobile secret service agent, putting ourselves between you and a bullet. And in the case of Rocky Boxing, this is one bullet we'll feel for weeks.   It's not that Rocky Boxing is a bad game, per se. It's just a boring one. Boxing games should be fast-paced and exciting, two qualities which Rocky Boxing fails to possess.   Rocky Boxing certainly has everything else a boxer based on the famous Stallone franchise should have: Training sessions in a meat locker, between-round comments from Mickey, and the exclusion of any reference to Tommy Gunn. During the game, Rocky must face down Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, and Ivan Drago -- the three main heavies of the films.   The boxing action itself is very slow and methodical. There is no real spontaneity to it, you just plow ahead and start tapping number keys to throw hooks and uppercuts. Rocky Boxing relies on combos to dish out the real damage. String together a series of numbers (all revealed in the game's instructions) and you can knock a man to the mat in seconds.   To practice these combos, try the training session. In a 'simon says' mini-game, you pulverize a side of beef over and over, nailing down combos. It's a good way to get used to the controls -- and, unfortunately, the pacing. The actual boxing matches are about a fun as beating meat. (Hey-o!)   Once in the actual ring, Rocky Boxing is more Rock 'em-Sock 'em, with two vaguely recognizable character sprites trading jerky blows. If any blows at all. Sometimes the computer just stands there and takes the beating. In one round, we dashed Apollo to the mat with little resistance -- but Mickey told us between rounds that Apollo was tearing me apart. We're we playing the same game? Later rounds against Clubber and Drago were a little tougher, as the computer did ring our bell with a few sly combos, but we still flattened them with ease.    Rocky Boxing looks the part well enough. Perhaps to avoid paying out image use fees, the in-game sprites only approximate their silver screen counterparts. Yet the Mickey comments are accompanied by the easily identifiable mug of Burgess Meredith.Rocky Boxing was a disappointment up one side and down the other. The action was slow and un-involving, and the visuals were just too cookie-cutter to impress. Sure, the higher-rated FOX Sports Boxing also relied on number button presses to dish out punches, but that game possessed urgency. The boxer was right in your face -- with an actual face. There's just too much disconnect in Rocky Boxing -- at no point do you care, until you remember you coulda bought Quizno's with the money you just spent on the download.", "date": "May 25, 2004"}
