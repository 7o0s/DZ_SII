The laughing stock of the fighting game community and an embittered success throughout the industry, Mortal Kombat had made enemies in all sects of the software universe. Parents didn't like it, critics didn't like it, and the media as a whole didn't seem to like it much either. Not to mention the fact that being the sworn enemy of Capcom's beloved Street Fighter franchise gave it a certifiable death wish, and its immense popularity among children and casual videogame players helped fuel the otaku factions with an even stronger dislike for the mainstream. Yes friends, Mortal Kombat was the scourge of the digital earth... and because of that, it made millions.   The reason for the game's hatred and success similarly was because of its premise. A very basic, very straightforward task with few strategies or challenges to give veteran gamers, Mortal Kombat became renowned not for its gameplay, but its gimmick instead. Packed with fatalities and excessive gore, the casual fans loved it because of how easy it was to get into and how different it was from everything else. On the flipside, hardcore arcade hounds and video jockeys despised the game for its limited combo system and unbalanced cheap-hit ratio. The result was a very divided community, and one that remained at each other's throats until 1999 when the final game in the series known as Mortal Kombat Gold came and quickly went. After its brief moment in the spotlight and the poor reception given to the action spin-off Special Forces in 2000, it appeared as though the series had finally run its course. The turbulent existence of Mortal Kombat had finally come to an end. Or so we thought?   Announced for the first time last April, Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance marks the return of Midway's moneybags franchise. The first non-compilation MK designed specifically for home consoles, it was a shock for everyone to learn that series co-creator Ed Boon had planned to make this latest installment vastly different from the previous games while still maintaining a few key aspects that retained the classic MK spirit. True three-dimensional fighting, entirely different fighting styles, and a deeper, more intuitive combo system were part of his vision, and much to the surprise of every editor in this office --he succeeded.   Features  In one of the gutsiest moves we've seen for an established videogame franchise, Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance kills off the series' biggest hero Liu Kang in the first three minutes of the opening cinema. A bold approach that supports the ~starting over~ mentality promised by Ed Boon, the lack of Mortal Kombat's mightiest hero (and cheapest, more powerful fighter) will force many long time veterans to rethink their strategy and start all over again; unless you're a fan of some of the other characters in the series that is. Sub-Zero, Sonya Blade, Scorpion, and Kung Lao have all returned with plenty of other favorite characters littering the battlefield. Embellishing 23 fighters in all, the roster isn't at it's biggest of all time, but it's most certainly at its most balanced.    The biggest and most welcome addition to the series is the ability to switch between fighting styles. Changing the approach, power, and strategy of a character each time out, it makes for a much different game of Mortal Kombat than we're used too. Don't get us wrong though, that's a good thing. Kenpo, Tae Kwon Do, Kori Blade, Kirehashi, and a long list of every other martial art known to man has pretty much made the cut, and since they're all based on real disciplines, effectively represents the real stance and style to a tee. The only thing we're bummed with in this respect is that the grapple-based martial arts (like Sambo, Jujitsu, and wrestling) aren't used that much at all. The series has never really had a very deep throw system or grapple engine, and it was quite bothersome to see that when the designers finally had the opportunity to change that, that they didn't.   One the option side of things, there's plenty more to talk about. One of my personal favorites is the ability to load an arcade-style profile that keeps track of your stats and koin totals. A splendid little feature that tallies your wins and losses, victory ratio, and Konquest performance, the player profile adds a little more personalization to your game in the same manner that Virtua Fighter 4 did. What makes it even better, is that you can save your profile to a memory card and take it over to a friend's house to play there, and even wager the Kombat Koins you've earned against each other for use in the Krypt.    Ah yes, the Krypt. A creepy underground lair filled with coffins and smoke, it's the perfect cover for an otherwise basic secrets menu. Given a maximum of 667 different unlockable goodies within the mausoleum, players can spend the Koins they earn (six types in all) in this section for a huge amount of prizes. Extra characters, animations, bonus costumes, hints, money, and all sorts of extras are yours for the plundering here. Once you've unlocked the secrets, you can then move to one of the game's other features, called ~Kontent~ and view them free of charge with additional info about that item a button press away. An excellent feature if we ever saw one.   Naturally you have fighting-specific features in here too, with Arcade mode clocking in as the best way to get more Koins and see the ending of your favorite character, while versus mode allows you to go head to head with a pal for brutal combat. A Tekken-like training feature has been thrown in for good measure, and there's even an option called ~Konquest~ that doubles as both a tutorial for budding combatants and supplement to the storyline. It's a very cool, graphically intensive journey that will take your fighter all over the world in search of another fighting technique, and the first stop you should make when firing this up for the first time.   Gameplay  Describing how to play Mortal Kombat used to be so much easier. Limited to four attack buttons and a block, the original game in the series was as basic as they come. Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance however, now utilizes seven different keys with one button in particular (the Change Style command) altering things drastically. But first things first, let's explain how the basics work, and then we'll move on to the more advanced tidbits:   The first thing to realize is that movement is still entirely digital, with the analog stick completely ignored. This makes perfect sense for Mortal Kombat anyway, considering the fact that the majority of special moves and techniques are all determined by tap moves rather than motions. In fact, a lot of your old favorites from earlier games, like the forward, forward-punch has remained in tact. As have the forward-backs, up-downs, and the similar maneuvers veterans have been playing with for years. Once you've accepted the fact that the fighting system still relies on these types of motions, it's on to the next aspect of gameplay -- the offense.   Formerly separated into punches and kicks, the four face buttons are now simply referred to as attacks one through four. Meaning different things for different characters, pressing the bottom two face keys doesn't necessarily mean that you'll perform a kick. It's all relative to the person/creature you're manipulating, and depending on what stance you use (we promise we'll get into that soon), can mean up to three-different offensive maneuvers per tap. This type of freedom allowed the developers to add a bit more diversity to the character lineup and meant that if one character's style in particular didn't require the use of kicks or punches, they weren't relegated to using them just for that button's sake. It's a brilliant idea and it fits the style of Mortal Kombat perfectly.    Blocking is still handled with a button instead of holding backwards on the pad. The single most debated issue in all of Mortal Kombat control schemes, the need to actually press a button instead of the pad has been argued over for years. Truth be told, the majority of the guys in the IGN office really didn't care for that kind of setup in the past games, and always considered it a hindrance. After playing titles like Soul Calibur and Virtua Fighter in the interim however, we've come to understand the importance of a block key in the 3D fighting genre. When Mortal Kombat was in the 2D realm, the need to press a button to defend yourself was asinine. In the present-day world of three-dimensional fighters and full-roaming battle however, it's necessity. For the first time in its existence, MK's block button made sense.   New to the series is the Special Move command. Your standard generic shortcut button that allows you to pull off certain maneuvers based on your character's stance, the special move button lets your fighter perform three important tasks. Depending on which fighting form you're currently engaged in, it can act as a throw, a counter attack, or impalement. Important on all three fronts, these three distinct types of attacks are the keys to mastering the more advanced fighting procedures and are needed to defeat the better human players and tougher CPU opponents. Interestingly enough, not every character has these types of abilities with the Special Move button, and depending on who you are, can only throw your opponent no matter their stance. That's not to say that every character doesn't have the ability to counter, throw, or impale -- they do. It's just that not all of them use the same path to do so.    Finally we have the stances, and what turn out to be the single most important change in the series history. Given three stances each, every character is allowed to switch between fighting styles at will and on the fly for maximum flexibility. Given two hand-to-hand styles and a weapon-based discipline per person, the potential for devastating combos goes through the roof. Similarly, certain styles from one fighter are more effective against another fighter's particular style. This addition makes switching between the different styles a key strategy in defeating certain opponents. You can even chain combos between the stances and switch them multiple times for some truly devastating health bar damage.   The fighting system on the whole is incredibly enjoyable and makes for the most fluid and playable Mortal Kombat yet. It's most assuredly an offensive game with a sound defense playing second fiddle to a good sword slash. Unfortunately, there are still a couple of problems that have haunted the previous titles in the series and end up mucking with things here: Specifically, the cheap-hit tactics and static A.I. of your CPU opponent and the imbalance of impaling your opponent.   The A.I. in particular ends up spoiling the single player game quite a bit, making for some strangely structured matches and bizarre fight mentality. In the beginning for instance, your opponents are total pushovers with little to no resistance in the least. But instead of a slow progression that eventually makes your opponent more difficult, the mood is suddenly changed by a series of hard-as-hell foes that show absolutely no mercy whatsoever. To make matters even worse, they can pull off stuff that a human player isn't capable of (like canceling a maneuver mid-animation while still hitting it, only to finish you off in a powerful 8-hit combo). Another bummer is the unfortunate tactic of beating Moloch. The ~Goro~ for this generation, jump kicking him in the head while running away is apparently the only way short of mastery to beat the behemoth. And while this was obviously an homage to the olden days of Mortal Kombat and the tactics that were needed to gain victory then, it doesn't necessarily make it a good move.    Speaking of good moves, the impale maneuver is a bit too powerful. Against novice and intermediate players, it's a guaranteed way to take them out fast. Since there's no way to counter the stabbing or remove the weapon once it's been embedded within your torso, your damaged character will eventually bleed to death while the opponent runs away and waits for it to happen. Meant to add an air of urgency to the action, there still should have been a way to counter this or remove it after the fact. As it stands now, the only way to avoid it is to move out of the way or to time your block properly.   And yet, despite those two particular grievances, Deadly Alliance is still a bucket load of fun. Strategy-oriented and full of special moves, combos, and chains, I had just as much fun with MK against the other editors in the office as I did with Tekken, Virtua Fighter, or Dead or Alive 3.   Graphics  The Mortal Kombat series has always prided itself on using the best possible visuals in the industry; whether it was the groundbreaking digitized graphics of the early games or the recent transition to full 3D character models. And though the eye candy in Deadly Alliance is still top of the line (especially in terms of lighting), there are a few specific concerns we have with the finished product --most notably, the models themselves.   Given an almost cartoon-like quality, the combatants and their surroundings have a larger than life heir about them that just barely miss the mark in terms of realism. Possibly done on purpose to give the more gruesome aspects of the game a little less terror, the plastic, doll-like characters aren't on the same level as Tekken, Virtua Fighter, or even Soul Calibur. Textures and special effects however, are a different story entirely.   Using a technology similar to that found in boxing games like Rocky and Knockout Kings, Deadly Alliance supports real-time facial damage. As the fight goes on and your character continues to sustain punishment, bruises, swelling, and lacerations appear on their faces to deform their mug entirely. It's a truly neat little feature and one that we'd like to see in fighting games (or any other game that involves taking damage for that matter) more often. The visual effects too are just as poignant, with geysers of blood shooting from the bodies of your defeated foes and pools of plasma littering the nearby arena floor. Other particle-related bits like snowflakes, rainfall, and smoke appear in practically every stage as well, with the backgrounds themselves sporting a healthy amount of detail and animation.    And then you have the fatalities. The bread and butter of Mortal Kombat for years, the elaborate death sequences aren't as good as they used to be. Given only one finishing move without the possibility of a stage fatality, the various kill moves have definitely seen better days. Exploding heads, stretching necks, and vomiting opponents are pretty much the norm in terms of ending it all, and as cool as that may sound on paper, it just doesn't play out as effectively as it could. Perhaps if the artists had decided to include more than one fatality per character, or even the classic ~Pit~ finisher, this would have been a different story, but as it stands now we're a bit disappointed.   Sound  Easily the best soundtrack in the history of the series, the ominous and menacing score sets the mood for each stage perfectly. The introductory song in particular has all the right emotions and when the screen flashes the neck-cracking death of hero Liu Kang, the down-tempo horror movie organ helps to create one of the most chilling moments we've seen in quite some time.   Sound effects aren't nearly as juicy, with underplayed vocals and interstitial grunts and moans that we've heard a million times before. One thing that struck us as particularly strange was how drowned out the narrator's voice is during the introduction, and unless you have a surround sound system to make the most of it, will be close to impossible to hear on a standard two-speaker television set.   Once you hook Deadly Alliance up to a receiver and some serious speakers however, you're in for a real treat. With fantastic directional changes and a great sense of area, the standard surround setup provides genuine aural bliss. Who cares if it's not in DTS or DPL2? It sounds great anyway! (if you have the equipment to run it that is).   We are a happy office. For the first time in all of IGN's history, we can sit together in unison and say in agreement that we enjoyed the latest Mortal Kombat game. Not without its problems, particularly in terms of the unforgiving CPU aggression, Deadly Alliance is still among the best fighting games of 2002. A late night favorite for the last couple of weeks and for a few months more, Deadly Alliance is a remarkable achievement in the history of a series we wrote off long ago. Congratulations all around, and congratulations to anyone lucky enough to pick this one up!", "date": "Nov 19, 2002"}
