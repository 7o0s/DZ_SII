Acquired only recently by Electronic Arts, the Command & Conquer developer decided to familiarize itself with the hardware by bringing gambling to the N64. After playing similar niche titles, such as Jeopardy!, we were ready for another quick, sprite-laden blur-fest, with little originality and only the necessary elements to make the game work. Turns out we underestimated Westwood. Not only are the graphics quite appealing, but the menu systems are well-thought out, and the game is actually really fun.GameplayGolden Nugget forgoes any kind of cheesy Adam West background story for a straightforward gambling experience. In the beginning, you register your name (you need a Memory Pak if you want to create a character) at a polygonal concierge, then you pick your game from a rotating (polygonal) menu.The following games are available for play: Black Jack Craps 5 Card Draw Roulette 7 Card Stud Video Poker Texas Hold'em Big Six Mini Baccarat Slots (six different machines)Each game can be played by up to four players, with the exception of obvious one-player games like the slot machines.Gameplay in Golden Nugget is exactly as it should be. You're having fun because the single games are fun, and nothing stands in the way of their enjoyment. The menus are as simple as can be. You first set your stakes and then place your bets by manipulating the amount with the analog stick. On games with larger boards, such as Roulette or Craps, the game splits the screen fourways, allowing you to move your icon (a colored diamond) over the field, placing chips with the A and B buttons. When you're done, press Z and the dealer will commence. Westwood made good use of the analog stick by enabling not only analog movement of the icon, but also analog casting of the dies or pulling the one-armed bandit's lever. Each game is well executed and easily playable. The AI of the computer opponents is realistic, with players splitting the decks at the right moments and bluffing at will.Options include the ability to track stats and display the overall winners, the ability to switch computer opponents on or off, music/sound volumes, dealer speed and camera speed settings, win-lose cures, and CPU big winners. For novice players, Westwood also included text descriptions of the individual games rules in both the manual and on-screen.GraphicsInstead of opting for sprite-based graphics a la Jeopardy!, Westwood went for fully polygonal tables and game machines. Each game is perfectly represented, from the spinning wheel on Big Six to the player's hand on Craps. Unfortunately, the game isn't running in hi-res, which makes some of the cards or table markings a bit hard to read, but this is really just a minor quibble. Good use of camera moves and angles, too.SoundImagine muted crowd noises and a laid back piano score playing in the background. The title melody is horrendous, but the sound effects all ring true. There are two different dealers, a man and a woman, each with his/her own ~color commentary~ and standard dealer sentences. It's not terribly impressive, but it works.This is a great game as far as gambling simulations go. Westwood didn't do much in the ways of atmosphere, though. There are no personalities/character players or attempts to immerse the player into the casino environment. If it wasn't for a small ~slide show~ (a few JPEGs of the casino), you wouldn't know that you're playing in the Golden Nugget... Still, the game is great at simulating the different games, the graphics are appealing, the menu systems refreshingly well-designed, and there is plenty of speech. Like most ~niche~ titles, this one lives off its party game value, offering up to four players to compete against each other. It's a nice break from all the shooting, jumping and killing, so if you're looking for something different, give it a try.", "date": "Dec 15, 1998"}
