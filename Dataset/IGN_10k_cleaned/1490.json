Beautiful graphics, sophisticated but ultimately senseless plotlines, and polysexuality galore will greet you within the first few moments in the game. It's definitely one of the more successful art game projects in recent note due to its strong connection to Alone in the Dark and interesting game show aesthetic, but even so, confusing control and a shallow feel bring down what might have been an intriguing new action/adventure experience.  There's no doubt that Alone in the Dark has a lot to do with this game's existence, and that's not just because one of the lead story designers from that game was a key figure in Devil Inside's creation. Demons and monsters abound in a rustic mansion possessed by an undead killer named The Night Howler, puzzles and control schemes are largely similar, and keys and bullets will quickly become your best friend in both games. Where Devil Inside really takes off, however, is in its modern TV update, making a romp through an evil mansion part of a live gameshow, where you play as an ex-cop looking to gain some fame and some cash by slaying evil for the perusal of the public at large. Then there's the part where Dave gains the ability to change into Deva, his ~devil inside~ of him. Get it? Actually no, it makes no sense whatsoever, but at least it gives you a chance to play as a guy with guns, and as a latex-laden demon woman who casts spells and eats souls.  Once you get past the weird logic of Devil Inside's world (what do you mean, Satan's fighting Lucifer in hell?), the game plays out like a mixture of Tomb Raider, Resident Evil, and yeah, Alone in the Dark. You'll look for a key to enter the house, check out any open doors, and slowly make your way through the mansion piece by piece, figuring out how to progress to the next section without getting your head bitten off, or your soul chewed on by The Night Howler's minions. The control scheme is similar to third person action games like Drakan, but with one main difference -- the camera is independent of your actions. While you can use a strafe key to keep the camera consistently at your back, if you're playing normally, your body moves with the keyboard, separate from the mouse, which controls the camera. Your mouse also controls your aim, and as Dave your weapons have a very handy laser pointer to make sure you get those head shots, the key to killing zombies quickly. I'm a big fan of head shot games, because they reward you for your skills while also allowing you to clean the damned as quickly as possible. Deva's shots are dead seeking, so you won't have to aim as much, but they're much, much weaker than your average shotgun or circular saw. Unlike games like Resident Evil, aiming is actually pretty logical in the game -- it's the camera that will kill you in this one. In an attempt to stop the horror of the ever-changing preset cameras that cause gamers to complain about most survival horror games, Cryo has replaced it with a camera system that's even more confusing. Get your character in the corner of a tight room, and you'll see what I mean. You'll have no idea where you're faced, where your enemies are, and how to get back under coherent control. It can be very, very frustrating, especially when you're up against multiple enemies at one time.  On a positive camera note, the option to watch the game through a variety of cameras is actually very cool. Because this is live TV, you're actually followed by a real cameraman, who you've got to protect if you want to make it through the game. A spy camera is your main view of the game, but you can switch to the cameraman's view at any time, or a cinematic camera if that's your thing. Even more cool, you can even set up picture-in-picture alternate views for a true news program feel. There's even TV fuzz and video glitches at irregular intervals in the game, just to remind you that you're in front of a live studio audience. As you kill monsters, Dave will unleash some brutally bad catchphrases to the applause of the viewing audience. Special events are peppers with host Jack T. Ripper's comments. Loading screens are bookended by announcements of commercial breaks. It's all very cool and stylish, and fills the game with a movie-like sense of mood and pacing.  But, uh, what does that have to do with gameplay? Not much. The game, while nothing innovative, stands pretty well on its own two feet. The graphics are stunning, as are the character animations. The neon floors of the TV studio are as shocking as the grungy, decayed interiors of the mansion, and everything is rendered with detailed textures, and some nice saturated lighting that adds to the mood. Because of the layout of the game, you're constantly checking out new rooms and environments, as well as finding new secrets -- just as it's worked well for a gazillion survival horror games, it works fantastically for Devil Inside to keep boredom from setting in. You're constantly moving from new room to new room, and taking out monsters with a satisfying splash of blood, as well as matrix replays of their demises at random intervals.  The comparisons to Alone in the Dark don't just end with the same gothic subject matter -- the puzzles tend to run along the same lines as well. Any doors that need opening will most likely be triggered by nearby switches. Bosses will give you specific ridiculous items, like a film reel for instance, which you can then go back and use to unlock yet another door. See a pattern here? While you may long for something a little more mature and subtle in your puzzling, the pacing of Devil Inside is kept quick enough that you'll rarely feel frustrated, especially when you've got gruesome zombies to slay.  In fact, other than the cumbersome camera, it's the shallow nature of the game that will keep you from making this your new friend. For all its beauty and style, it's incredibly straightforward -- you'll find almost every object and puzzle piece by clicking around on any nearby objects as you walk into a new room. Inevitably, that stick you found will work in the next room on a special switch. And while Deva's a really cool counterpart, she never seems to be that useful in terms of gameplay, especially when you're stuck on a tough boss. It's a great concept, but one that's rarely utilized when it comes down to getting through the game. It would have been nice to have put more adventure in this action title, especially given the dense environment to navigate, but as it stands Devil Inside still provides some nice action punches.  If you're hungering for something to shoot, and some zombies to cringe at, then Devil Inside will keep you entertained. But in today's modern age of deeper survival horror, Devil Inside ultimately leaves you wishing that those demons from hell would have brought along a little more to chew on than switches and bullets.  -- Vincent Lopez      Want to share your opinions with the world?
