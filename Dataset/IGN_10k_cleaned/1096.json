Like good lovin', you can never have too much of it.  Need further proof?  The Jesus Lizard and Ol' Dirty Bastard weren't the first, nor will they be the last, musical acts to write odes to cold, hard cash.  Paul Newman and Tom Cruise, two of Hollywood's finest, combined talents in a 1980s theatrical tribute to the stuff (I'm referring to The Color of Money for you young 'uns).  And as the Caesar's Palace series of video games proves, loot is never so much fun to play with as when it belongs to someone else.  Wanna be a high roller?  A fat whale named Ishikawa who drops a hundred grand a night and gets comped on the room, meals, and company for the evening?  Mosey on up to the lobby and use the roulette wheel interface to punch in a name or alias.  Then saunter towards the casino area, which is subdivided into six parts.  Visiting the cashier section allows you to borrow, store, or withdraw funds from the ATM and the stats option is self-explanatory.  Your chance to get rich hides under the other categories, specifically Card Games, Table Games, Video Games, and Slot Machines.  Lovely as that may be, to reinvent the decade old Caesar's Palace series, Interplay had to teach an old dog new tricks.  With a finite number of games of chance to choose from in existence, variation alone couldn't make this product stand out from the umpteen others clogging the aisles.  Deliverance (sorry, no squeal like a pig jokes follow.. oh wait..DOH!)  arrives by way of the third dimension, a construct which lent its knack for sprucing up visuals to Runecraft's skillful hands.  A pocket stuffed with two G's and a dream are all it takes to succeed in this virtual casino.  Gorgeous 3D roulette wheels, craps tables, and rounds of blackjack, baccarat, or Spanish 21 can make or break a would-be hustler.  Objects such as video poker machines and slots could use a new paint job, but with so many varieties (Tens or Better, Joker's Wild, Baseball Challenge, Halloween, etc etc etc) laid out for your pleasure, it's not surprising that a few are known for their personalities, not physical charms.  Besides, Beauty's nothing but a distraction and has no place in a high stakes game where working one's way to the big time tables demands persistance and copious amounts of luck.  Ambtions to become a PC millionaire are noble, if utterly retarded when examined in another light.  Playing for a few moments here and there is par for the course.  Longer sessions aren't likely to help card sharks sharpen their game, no matter how much the coach feature chastises them for not hanging onto a pair of twos in stud challenge mode.  Multiplayer mode is confined to a single computer, and unless the thought of computer companions tickles your pickle, it's a good idea to have a few friends loafing around.  They won't add to the fun, but it's nice to have someone to laugh with when the German female dealer voice exclaims ~Dealer vins!~  'Millenium Gold Edition' this may be, but must-have product it is not.  Although collectors can't go astray with Caesar's Palace 2000, to the common man the title is identical to everything that's come before.  A nose job here, face lift there, and tummy tuck over yonder have done wonders for the game's image.  Should we be privy to a gameplay enlargement the next time wrinkles show, then and only then would the software adequately justify the cost of the surgery bills.  -- Scott Steinberg    Comment on this story", "date": "Jul 12, 2000"}
