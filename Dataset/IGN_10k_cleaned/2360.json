Build a bomb shelter! Awright, not yet. Sims 2 isn't out, so until then, we've had to keep satiated on the delicious but tiny scraps sent from Maxis. Livin' Large gave us weirder worlds to work with, and House Party gave us easier ways to get along, but still, in the end it came down to hot tubs, good wallpaper, and a great toilet. The world of the Sims has had some new paint, but nothing's truly changed. Until now.  Hot Date adds an entirely new area to the Sims universe -- downtown -- and more importantly, has made interaction between your characters a huge game in itself. Plus there's that dating thing, sorta the whole point of all of this. There's a lot to enjoy, and a ton of new ways to enjoy it. You can go to a fancy restaurant, check out the beach, or maybe just do some shopping at a mall. There's a park for relaxing, or a downtown center with a giant fountain and a few specialty shops and restaurants for entertainment. And it's all just a cab ride away from your home.  There are also two major additions to the way your Sims interact, as well. Sims now have specific interests, like the 60's or weather, that will cause characters to get along like old chums, or butt heads like bulls. Reading magazines will keep you up to date with topics, and better your chances with someone that you'd like to become friends with that has differing interests. Second, there are now two meters on your Sims, one for short term relationships, the other for long term. So you may entertain someone for one day, but to get them into your inner circle may take a lot longer. It's the payoff for the more elaborate and fulfilling interaction that Hot Date brings to the game.  Because Hot Date is actually more about all levels of personal communication rather than just dating, they've given you a surprising number of new options where there used to be just a handful. You can wave instead of just greeting, or you can give multiple levels of compliments. Want your hug to be friendly instead of intimate? Feel like growling with a flirt instead of just checking someone out?  Even objects give you more ways to interact. Benches and new swings allow you to move closer to your date, or cuddle up. You can get a little frisky, or even go for a kiss, which will end in a slap because, let's be honest, you're a pretty forward person, you fiend. You can show someone your muscles, discuss your interests, talk about specific subjects, or even (gulp) ask someone else on a date. Because Sims have interests now, getting into someone's pants, er, trying to be someone's steady date is a much more complicated affair, involving a set of artful steps that should include favoring their ego, finding common subjects, buying them dinner, and tenderly flirting. Then you can go in for the big smooch, and get in a little cuddling at the beach.  For instance, I put Stephen, Tal, and Dan into the game because -- obviously -- I wanted to force them to marry each other. Unfortunately, Stephen hooked up with a cute townie and got a little cuddle action (see pics), though he was brushed off when he tried to tongue it up on the first date. And poor Dan couldn't get play with Tal (not attracted), or that old grandma raver that loves the boats over at the park. The only thing left for him to do was sob, pee on the grass, and make burgers on the park barbecue.  For the first time, there are fully NPC characters to interact with as well, called Townies. Sure you could order up a weird clown, or get pizza delivered, but could you try to date them? Now you can start relationships with the locals in downtown, and even date and eventually tie the knot, bringing them into your home, and into your game as a playable character. How's that for a Sims RPG? Your quest, nerdy knight, is to plant one on that hot chick that hangs out at the ice cream shop. Or maybe just dance with that guy that looks like a red-headed Urkel over at the boardwalk. Dating sort of ~connects~ a character to you as well, so now when you go to dance, you've got someone else to do it with you. A fresh scoop of ice cream, or maybe just a snuggly picnic becomes more fun when you've got someone to share it with.  Even the addition of new items comes with a new twist -- you've got an inventory you can use now, as well as the ability to shop. Match that with the character's interests, and it becomes a much more complex affair. Does that old lady with the hot pants want a copy of The Sims, or would she rather have a teddy bear? Do you even want to spend your hard earned cash on getting some roses when maybe just some candy would do it? You can also bring the items back with you to your home to give as gifts, making the act of going shopping even more realistic. In our world of super-marketing, I was a little surprised that you couldn't buy Nestle brand chocolate, or a Ty beanie baby for your friends. I mean, I thought the 00's were about making even more massive marketing money on top of your fresh money. Perhaps for the next add-on, ~productopia.~  You can also add items to the existing downtown environments, raze an area and start fresh, or build something unique in the empty lot provided. You're going to be so busy running around and being a slut for so long that you'll probably wait before touching the empty lot, but just so you know, there are a ton of new objects to use, since they've pretty much had to create retail environments from scratch. Hot dog stands, booths, front counters, ice cream fridges, candy shop materials, magazine racks...you name it, it's there. Plus, no bedrooms to design, or kitchen to worry about! It's great.  There are other nice touches in the game, like employees that speak with new accents -- like an old grumbly maid, or a southern gentleman working behind a counter. A fancy restaurant has classy new music, while the park is filled with the gentle sounds of tiny boats and people at play. As with all Sims aural additions, everything's high quality. It's a nice addition to hear even normal Sim voices interacting in new ways, especially if you've been getting a little bored with old classics like ~zzzhis fuushhul iz fresshheeaay!~ every time they eat salad. Not that I'm bored with that. I live on their fressheay, every day. Wake up, shave, say fresshheeaay, and I'm out the door for work.  That's not to say that everything's perfect in your Sim world. There are still the same nuisances, like the sludgy camera and unreliable pathing, and you'll still find yourself working your butt off to keep friendships intact, and your Sims entertained. What Maxis has done with this latest version, however, is make the downtown environment a much easier place to exist in. Not only does time stop in the neighborhood world while you're in downtown but your energy meter depletes much slower, allowing you to enjoy the new environments much more, since you're not racing home after ten minutes of play because your Sim is falling asleep at the bench. While it's harder to build relationships in the game, downtown makes it easier, because you've got more time and ways to do it. More than House Party, downtown is a perfect place to please your Sims for their ~regular~ life back at home.  This isn't the full-fledged leap that you're looking for -- you'll have to wait for Sims Online and the inevitable Sims 2 for that -- but it's certainly the largest step that the game has taken over the course of its life. While the other expansions have been mostly superficial in their additions, Hot Date tries to add some new elements to the mix. The same problems with the engine still exist, and if you're tired of making people go to the bathroom in the middle of making out with someone, you'll still be annoyed. If you've never stopped playing the series though, or if you've been looking for a reason to get back into the lives of your little polygon people, then there's no better time than with a hot, smoldering, sweaty, groping, throbbing...good clean date.  -- Vincent Lopez      Want to share your opinions with the world?
