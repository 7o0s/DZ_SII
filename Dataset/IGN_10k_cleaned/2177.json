However, Natsume's Reel Fishing is one title that kept my fishing pole in the closet.No matter how hard I tried, I could not catch a fish. Either I suck, or the fish in this game are just way too strong. Everytime I put my line in the water, the crazy strong fish would either snap my line or steal my bait. I wanted to break out the dynamite.Graphically, this game is superior to any console fishing game. The fishing environments are extremely detailed and the fish look and move like nature's own.The only other saving grace in Reel Fishing is its load time. Most fishing games are cursed with an uncontrollable amount of load time. Reel Fishing possesses some really smooth above to below water transitions that make the game really relaxing to play. But you still don't catch any fish.Overall, this game looks and sounds great, but it just got too frustrating after awhile. Sorry, but my tackle box remains closed.Jay Boor", "date": "Oct 31, 1997"}
