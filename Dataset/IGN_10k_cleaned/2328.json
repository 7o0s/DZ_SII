And while NCAA Final Four 2002 features some big improvements over its very mediocre predecessor, it and the company's reputation still has a long way to go before it regains the respect that it received in the early years of the PlayStation.   Gameplay When you start playing the game for the very first time, you're probably going to get the feeling that you're playing the exact same game as last year, but that's not really the case. In actuality, there have been numerous gameplay tweaks and improvements in the gameplay that won't be very noticeable unless you load up last year's title and do some direct comparisons.  For instance, the Touch Shooting meter has been changed a bit and it's not just a visual transformation. The timing and balance are both better this time around, although there are some major balance problems still. Instead of the red bar and the green line, there's now a ball that moves up this meter that has a large circular top, where you must center the ball perfectly to nail a shot. The meter moves a little slower than it did in the past, which alleviates many of the problems that previous games have had with shooting the ball in the paint.   Although while the timing is better and the larger Touch Shooting meter is a little easier to see, it still brings forth some balance issues. When playing on the Freshman and Sophomore difficulty, you'll have no problem hitting 80% of your three point shots with just about any player on your team. The balance is a little better if you go up to the Junior level, but even here it's possible to nail shots at that same percentage with a player with good outside shooting skills. And even though upping the difficulty level up to the Senior setting brings the shot percentages back down to Earth, this brings up other problems that will throw off the balance of the game further. You can always turn this feature off if you don't like it anyway.  Another area where you'll notice some improvements, and this is also related to shooting, is with the frequency of blocked shots. In last year's title, the computer would block or foul you on just about every shot you tried to put up with a man close to you on the harder difficulty settings if you didn't pump fake. Both the blocked shot frequency and foul frequency has been toned down a lot. Plus, instead of having the pump fake mapped to a different button than the shot button (it was triangle for pump fake and X for shoot in last year's title), you just have to tap the shot button (which is Square in this year's game) to do a pump fake, which is the way that it ought to be.   Steals were also a problem in last year's game on several different levels. The frequency was enormously high and when you would press the steal button when at a large distance from the guy handling the rock, instead of just reaching for the ball, the player would slide unrealistically in the direction of the guy with the ball and go for the steal. In Final Four 2002, the steal frequency is still very high, but a little more down to Earth, and the steal animation is a lot less overdone.  And with steals and blocked shots, as well as shooting fouls, reach-in fouls, charging fouls and CPU shooting, there are adjustable gameplay sliders that will allow you to change the frequency of each of these occurrences. So, if you feel that there are too many blocked shots or steals, you can move down the sliders for those two things and you'll see the number of steals and blocks go down in number.   Obviously it would have been better if the game had been balanced perfectly on the default settings, but it's a nice option to have these sliders to help make the game play the way you want it to play. This is especially important because on the default setting the CPU shooting percentage is way too high, much like it was in Final Four 2001. If you play the game without changing anything except for the difficulty setting, you can look forward to the computer hitting shots at a clip of 70% or higher. If you mess with the slider, you can get this back to a more realistic level, but you're going to have to figure out what works best for you.  Also new to the game is a post-up button (R2), as opposed to just having a protect the ball button like in last year's title that was almost completely useless in the low post game. The post-up button does allow for the backing down of defenders down low and makes for an improved inside game, but you're still limited in what you can do in the post. It'd be nice to have a little more control over what your player can do when backing someone down and this game doesn't bring all that much to the table in this area of the game.    The free throw meter from Final Four 2001, which was setup like its Touch Shooting meter but with a pulsating green area instead of a pre-set one, has been dumped in favor of two different ones: Normal and Expert. The Normal one is you classic ~T~ meter that requires you to press the button twice -- once to center a ball that's moving horizontally and a second time to center a ball moving back and forth vertically on the meter. It works just like every other ~T~ meter you've seen and the speed at which the balls move back and forth are based on the free throw percentage of the player and the difficulty setting that the game is being played on.  It definitely gets the job done and is my preferred method to use, but for those looking for a change there's the Expert setting that handles free throw shooting similar to how it's done in Sega Sports' NBA 2Kx series. With this you have a ball to the left of the basket and one above the basket and by moving each analog stick together, you must center both balls above the basket. Obviously, how close you get both balls to the center determines the likelihood of your shot going in. It's more trouble than it's worth, in my opinion, but using the analog sticks on the Dual Shock controller is a little easier than using the triggers on the Dreamcast controller to do a similar thing in the 2Kx series.  A further influence from Sega Sports' 2Kx series can be seen in the game's default camera setting, which gives the user a vantage point looking up the court. The default camera gives you a great view of the court and it's substantially better than any of the similar camera views offered in last year's title. And if you prefer the more classic look from the side of the court, it has several side views and 3/4 view perspectives. But, the default view is the best one available in my opinion.  Most of the game outside of these aforementioned changes is about on par with what was offered in last year's title. The player is still allowed to do things like Auto Cover defenders by holding the X button (it was actually triangle in last year's title), which makes defense a little more manageable, and all of the Icon Passing, Cutting, and Screening abilities that have become staples in all of 989 Sports' basketball games are back and work as good as ever.  The double pass has also returned, but actually works a little better now that the passing in the game has been tightened up a bit. Final Four 2001 had this big problem where the animation for passing the ball was a little long and balls would float out of the player's hands, but this has been fixed for the most part. Passes now leave the hands of the player fairly quickly and because of this it's a little easier to pass around the ball more efficiently whether on fast breaks or in a standard perimeter offense.    Even with all of these improvements, Final Four 2002 still has a long way to go before it can be considered a really good basketball game. The biggest problem with it is that the AI needs to improve quite a bit. The computer rarely, if ever, runs a realistic offense or any plays and will often pass up open looks to the basket. Plus, the CPU players without the ball don't do a good job of moving around in a realistic manner. Unless you call a play, you'll never see them do anything but stand there waiting for you to pass the ball to them. Even if you haven't called anything, these guys should be doing something. Just because the game has things like Icon Cutting and Screening, doesn't mean that the CPU-controlled players should never make cuts or set picks without being ordered to do so.   Features One of my biggest gripes with Final Four 2001, outside of the obvious gameplay flaws, was that it had a pretty bare bones feature set. This is no longer an issue with this year's game because the developers have crammed this baby full of all of the must-have modes that you'd expect in a college basketball.   The most important of the new additions is the Dynasty Mode that lets the user take control over any of the available Division 1-A basketball teams that it has in the game and try and build the program by taking them through multiple seasons that are split-up by an off-season where you can recruit players from across the nation.   The recruiting process is pretty cool in that it lets you look at different players that have some interest in your school based on the four different regions (North, South, East, West) and by the States in each region. Good teams will have more highly-rated players interested in them and you'll have a better chance of seeing more talent in your home state eager to play for your school.   And for each recruit in a particular state, you can easily look at all over their stats, including their interest level in your school, height, weight, position, and all of their skill attributes. If you've chosen to play the game as an Assistant Coach you can use 10 total visits to try and increase a player's interest level in your school and if you chose Head Coach, you'll have 20 visits. Once you've divvied out your visits, you can then look at a list of players that want to go to your school, which might include people you've visited and might not, and choose which players you'll fill your available spots.   The only problem here is that since it's possible to end the recruiting process, look at your candidates and then back out and change your visits, it's a little too easy to get top talent year after year. Even without doing this, it seems a little too easy to build a winning program, especially if your team is already among the league's best. Just by simulating season after season and not even doing anything with the recruiting, I was able to sim Duke to 21 National Championships in 26 years. A team like Duke should be able to get top talent easier than a Delaware State, but it shouldn't be that ridiculously easy.   It'd also be nice if the recruiting process were a little more like it is in EA Sports' NCAA Football 2002 where it takes place over several weeks and you're given additional information about each recruit after you've visited him. Regardless, it's a very nice feature to have in the game and it helps make the game worth playing for extremely diehard college basketball fans.   Another nice new feature is the Career Mode that lets you take on the role of a Graduate Assistant at a small school where you have the ability to work your way up the coaching ladder at that school or go on to bigger and better things elsewhere. The difference between this and Dynasty is that instead of just trying to build one team, you are given job offers with other schools at the end of a year based on just how well your team performed. So, instead of just wanting to make your team better, you also want to move on to better, more well known schools that will make it even easier to come out on top.   During the seasons, whether it is a single season, Dynasty or Career, you have all of the basic statistical options available to you. You can have a look at the stats of every single player or team in the game for the current season. And you can even check out the Writers and Coaches Top 25s, see the leading candidates for first and second team all conference for all of the conferences in the game and for all of the NCAA, and see a list of the teams that are on the Bubble for the NCAA tournament. The only things that are really missing here are career stats for players that haven't yet graduated or left early for the NBA Draft and the ability to edit players (names, attributes, etc.).   Final Four 2002's create a player abilities are a bit limited, as well. You can only create players when a Season starts and when you are in the recruiting state of the Dynasty and Career modes. And the Create Player option itself, is limited in that you can only adjust things like the player number, position, handedness, height, weight and attributes, and cannot change his appearance.  Graphics Visually, NCAA Final Four 2002 is an improvement over the 2001 game, but only a very slight one. In fact, when you play the game for the first time, you probably won't even notice the changes unless you go back to the old game. The player models are a little more detailed and a bit more rounded out at the edges, the heads are more naturally shaped, and there are some new animations to be seen.   The framerate seems to be a solid 60 throughout and the general appearance of the players and background objects are pretty crisp and clear, but the game is still inferior graphically to competing products on the system. Even though there are a lot of new player animations, they still aren't all that smooth, especially when they transition from one to another and there are a lot of odd ones that will make the player do unrealistic movements like spin in a circle after making a steal attempt.   It definitely has a very clean look, but the detail should be higher and the animation definitely needs to be improved on several levels before you can begin to consider this a great looking basketball videogames.  Sound The audio in the game isn't all that bad; it's just not all that moving. The commentary, which is handled by Eddie Doucette and Billy Packer, has some variety to it and is generally timed well with what's going on the game, but it's not lively enough for a college basketball game. Because of this, a lot of the excitement of college hoops is lost because the commentators don't convey it at all.   The crowd noises are pretty good, though, and there seem to be a lot of school specific chants and noises, but even this isn't nearly as dynamic as it should be. Crowds get louder and quieter based on what's happening in the game, but it's not as finely tuned with exactly what's happening on the court, as it should be. Again, not bad, but could be much better. Much like the rest of the 2002-branded products from 989 Sports, NCAA Final Four 2002 represents a step back in the right direction for its particular series and for the company. It won't make anyone change their mind about the 989 Sports brand and Final Four 2002 still has a long way to go before it can be considered a top notch basketball game, but it's good to know that the people developing these games are listening to the criticisms being thrown their way. Nevertheless, I still can't give this game a buy recommendation. If you have a really strong desire to buy a college basketball game, you should wait and see how EA Sports' March Madness 2002 turns out before you plunk down the $50 to pick this baby up.", "date": "Nov 29, 2001"}
