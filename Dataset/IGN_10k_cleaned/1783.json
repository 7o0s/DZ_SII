But the once feared Soviet military is now a shadow of its former glory, its nuclear attack submarines lay rusting in their harbors and its senior officers reduced to driving taxicabs in Moscow. As result, the US military has entered its own an era of decline and is less than a third its former size. Large-scale armed conflict no longer poses the ominous threat for which so many sabres were rattled in the 1980's. All indications suggest that world war has been relegated to the annals of history and to the realms of fantasy. Yet even as the day-to-day roles of our traditional military forces diminish, our nation's Coast Guard faces challenges and dangers of ever-increasing severity. Whether it is rescuing sailors cast overboard during a hurricane to thwarting drug traffickers in high-speed boat chases, the mission of the Coast Guard is real and valid. From a purely gaming perspective this is a world rich with opportunity, yet one almost entirely untapped.  Developed in Denmark by Interactive Vision, Search & Rescue 2 attempts to convey the excitement and peril of flying the HH-65A Dolphin, the U.S. Coast Guard's front-line rescue helicopter, in more than 50 land and sea missions. I am at a loss to understand what may have possessed a Scandinavian company to take on a project involving such subject matter, since I can't think of a single related movie or television export over the last twenty years that could have inspired them. Nevertheless their efforts are well meant and the resulting simulation is, at times, quite compelling.   Search & Rescue 2 is a down-to-the-rivet simulation of a very complex helicopter platform. Every activity in the game bleeds authenticity and procedure, though sometimes to a fault. While it is interesting to hear the lengthy radio checks and safety precautions conducted before, during and after flight it rarely has impact on actual game play. SAR2 is based around a very robust mission generator that can emulate rain, fog, wind and hurricane conditions from dawn to dusk and on into night. There is an incredible array of mission choices, such as: boat explosions, car crashes, harbor rescues, cliff-side extractions, landing on the decks of ships in rough waters and drug interdictions.     ~Realistic~ and ~arcade~ flight models are available, but the latter is seriously hobbled by the omission of auto-hovering and autopilot functionality; both of which are utterly invaluable when trying to stabilize your craft in high winds or over choppy seas. Be prepared to spend a lot of time just learning how to keep yourself aloft before you even consider embarking on a mission or campaign. Too much collective and you will drop like lead balloon, too much pitch and you'll torque the rotor blades right off their spindle. Sometimes just lining up on the target can take upwards of thirty minutes. Patience and frustration are the hallmarks of the early game.   Rather than dumb down the controls in order to focus on the real meat of the game, searching and rescuing, Interactive Vision has chosen the opposite path by creating a flight model that is ultra-sensitive, requiring precise and deliberate controller inputs. Just starting up the engines is a complex, multi-key affair, comprised of the following sequential presses: E, T, R, E, T. This simulates actual engine ignition procedures. Authentic? Yes. Necessary? No.   Mouse, keyboard and joystick are supported (including most rudder and throttle variations). But none may be remapped; forcing you must fumble with some combination therein. Worse yet, not all of the aircraft's functionality is described in the manual. Fortunately, a keyboard reference sheet is included, though it marred by a number of typos.   Only when you master the basic rudiments of flight does enjoying the rest of the game become possible. A simple and attractive interface allows you to select a mission, adjust its parameters and get briefed on the circumstances. You may choose to start from the ground, in the air or over the target site  which is nice, since many of the missions take place 60 miles or more away from base. Time is always a factor, since someone is usually FUBAR with one of over 30 different injuries, like skull fractures, heart attacks, serious burns, meningitis or jelly fish bites  my personal favorite.   Traffic accidents are one early variant. Arriving on scene you see an overturned and burning automobile, police cars angled nearby with lights flashing. You must land proximate to the accident, but not so close as to injure someone in your rotor downwash. Once grounded your flight mechanic and co-pilot rush a stretcher to the wreck and strap in the survivor. You then make haste to the nearest hospital before the victim succumbs to their injuries. Needless to say this is a significant distance away. Flying into the city you must locate the rooftop-landing pad and put down quickly. Your crew constantly relates the deteriorating patient status, so tension is thick. Realistic wind conditions and turbulence whip your Dolphin (the other one) as you struggle to touchdown. Do well and you may earn promotion, do poorly you'll kill a lot of people. Fun!   The setting of Search & Rescue 2 is an undefined region of the coastal United States. The graphics engine successfully conveys a world that feels authentic, yet is generic enough to be mistaken for just about any seaside burg in the Western world. Cars drive up and down the roads, factories billow thick smoke and boats putter around the docks of rural fishing villages. The 3D models for each of the vehicles, ships and buildings are very detailed and realistic. However, the people are all static cardboard cutouts exhibiting no animation whatsoever. This is a real letdown since your entire purpose is to save human lives; it's hard to care about stick figures. It is a surprising lack of detail when you consider the lengths the developers went to create such an otherwise believable environment.   Audio support is fairly unimpressive as background music consists of a couple of moody, New Age pieces that fail to match the tone of the action; nor do they change pitch when arriving at a crash scene or other point of tension. The whine of the Dolphin's twin turbine engines sounds very authentic both in and out of the cockpit and radio communication between your pilot and flight mechanic is frequent, though stiffly delivered and seems to be read right off the pages of the standard Coast Guard regulations manual.   Search & Rescue 2 simulates a very unique and compelling aspect of our military forces. Given the broad variety of the Coast Guard's responsibilities it is surprising that this is such virgin gaming territory. Oddly, the packaging and sub-twenty dollar price point seem to suggest an action game. However, there is no mistaking that SAR2 is a deep and rich simulation. Had the developers focused less on the physics and more on the situations this could have been a great sleeper title. However, in its current overly complex and frustrating state, Search & Rescue 2 is simply going to prove too frustrating to the average gamer.   -- David Kozlowski Want to share your opinions with the world?
