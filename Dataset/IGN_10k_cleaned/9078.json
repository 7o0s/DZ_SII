With the announcement of Metal Gear Solid coming to cell phones, we were eagerly awaiting the inevitable return of gaming's first vampire-slaying family. When Konami announced that an original Castlevania title was heading to mobile, we were fairly excited, but now that it's here, we found that it was a hit-and-miss experience. While the game delivers a moderately fun time while it lasts, unfortunate drawbacks hurt its overall appeal.  In Castlevania: Order of Shadows, you take up arms as Desmond Belmont. Along with his two sisters, Zoe and Dolores, he's going to tear the famed castle apart in his mission to put a stop to all undead activities. The reason for this threat lies with a new cult simply called ~The Order~ that is scheming to resurrect a legendary vampire, and Desmond is the only line of defense. The story is presented rather tepidly, so it doesn't have much impact aside from setting up the showdown with Dracula himself.   The gameplay is fairly basic. It was built from the ground-up specifically for mobile, drawing influence from the old-school 8-bit Castlevania titles, but employs some of the franchise's contemporary elements. Movement controls are mapped to the d-pad, with the OK button used for your attacks. Players may find themselves getting frustrated with tasks as simple as climbing up a flight of stairs, as you need to be in just the right spot to get up or down -- a sad holdover from the 8-bit classics. Though the slower-paced game play could baffle newer players, gamers that marched into Dracula's castle with Simon Belmont twenty years ago will feel at home.  There isn't a huge amount of weapons for doing battle with the forces of darkness here. It's always a huge treat when you stumble upon a new whip or sword while exploring the perilous castle, but that's largely absent in this mobile adventure. As you progress through the game, you unlock a few abilities that allow you to get to various parts of the castle that you wouldn't be able to get to otherwise. Series staples like the basic slide, backslide, and the double jump will help you defeat bosses and reach previously unattainable areas.  To make up for this shortcoming is the alchemy system. This new spell-based device allows players to pick up scrolls throughout the castle and use them as one-shot attacks or stat upgrades. You'll be able to shoot things such as frostbolts or lightning at your foes, You can also cast stat-effecting spells on yourself, such as making your character stronger for a short duration. Sadly, most alchemy hits your enemies with fairly light damage, as if you were throwing a cotton ball their way. It's just better to use a whip with classic secondary attacks like the cross, as you only have to worry about finding energy, which isn't hard.  The biggest gripe of the game is the absence of exploration. Exploration has always been a huge part of Castlevania. This entry is extremely linear. There is no map (and no need for a map), making the game feel like a step backwards. What's a Castlevania game without finding hidden areas or bosses?   There were a few glitches in the game that hindered the experience. Basic collision detection with enemies felt a bit off. Desmond was injured when he wasn't touching anyone, or an enemy avoided damage despite the fact that a weapon clearly made contact.Castlevania: Order of Shadows is a decent entry in the series, but we just weren't wowed. The game play is a bit slower than we preferred, it still provides a modest escape, if just for a short while. In the past decade, the Castlevania series has championed replay value, but when we were done with this game, there really wasn't much else to do, and that's a disappointment. There are still a few kinks to work out, but hopefully Konami can learn what works and what doesn't so next time out, we get something a bit more dynamic.", "date": "Sep 21, 2007"}
