A fine ninja action game in its own right, it's always been overshadowed by other, more well known titles like Shinobi and Ninja Gaiden. Then again, if you dropped some dollars on Ninja Gaiden to get your jumping, slashing fix, you can't be faulted for that. But don't dismiss this ~other~ ninja game as you turn your attention to Hayabusa -- Ninja Spirit deserves notice too.   In Ninja Spirit, as in Ninja Gaiden, you control a sword-wielding shadow warrior seeking revenge for the murder of his father. But the similarities end with the storyline. Spirit is its own adventure, and plays in its own distinct way. Your hero here is Moonlight, a man who's less concerned about wall-crawling and urban acrobatics and more attuned to the classic style of ninja-ing from ancient, feudal Japan. A style of ninja-ing that involves jumping really high.    The Legend of Kage on NES tried to pull it off, but failed horrendously. Ninja Spirit gets it right -- your hero can leap through the air with ridiculous skill, covering startlingly large vertical and horizontal distance. You're able to jump from branch to branch in darkened forests, clashing with enemies hidden in the leaves. Your weapon is just a simple sword at the start, but can be upgraded to a more powerful, wave-emitting form that can deflect any bad guy's ranged attacks. You can also swap out your main weapon altogether, and wield instead distance attacks like thrown powder bombs that explode on contact with the ground.   Sound promising so far? It gets better! You can split your body into three with Spirit clones as well, a mechanic that rival franchise Gaiden also used in its second installment. So once you're fully upgraded and equipped, you'll have three separate forms of yourself, bouncing around the screen in long, bounding arcs, and completely devastating any enemies stupid enough to get in your way.   It's all very satisfying, and certainly distinctly different enough to separate itself from the shadow of Ninja Gaiden and SEGA's Shinobi. Ninja Spirit is really one of the best games to have appeared on the TurboGrafx, years ago, and it just speaks to the low install base of that system that a game like this was never able to find much of an audience.    If you give Spirit a shot, you'll find a few extra features included as well -- a simple sound test, and a difficulty adjuster. The game defaults to ~PC-Engine Mode,~ which gives Moonlight a health bar that allows him to take about five hits before dying. The alternative is ~Arcade Mode,~ which removes the health bar in favor of making Moonlight drop dead after just one single hit, Contra-style. Playing it that way can be a challenge, and you can take it on alone or with a friend. Ninja Spirit offers a two-player, alternating mode where you and another can compete against each other for a high score.Ninja Spirit seems to be doomed to comparison, still not escaping the shadow of Tecmo's famous Gaiden franchise over a decade and a half after its original release. And, head-to-head, Ninja Gaiden would get the nod -- but Spirit is a solid second ninja adventure that's worth consideration for another empty spot in your library. Play both, in fact, and you can avenge your father's death twice in the same day.", "date": "May 14, 2007"}
