That itty-bitty handset clipped to your belt (and hopefully tucked underneath a shirt so as not to be one of those ~look at me!~ people) is well on its way to becoming a miniature arcade, full of so many old-school titles, you might try to shove a quarter in the battery slot. The latest blast from the past is Taito's classic side-scrolling shooter, Moon Patrol, courtesy of the good ship JAMDAT.  Features: Classic shooting action High score board  Moon Patrol is one of those rare classic arcade games that is really is as fun to play as you remember.  Strapped in the cockpit of your magenta lunar buggy, you must hop over craters, mines, and rocks while targeting UFOs that zoom overhead. And there's no such thing as stopping. The lunar surface constantly scrolls by, the only choices you have are accelerate or slow down.  The first few checkpoints are a cakewalk, thanks to not just familiarity with the game, but also to the good control scheme implemented by JAMDAT. Using your touchpad, you control the acceleration of your crawler. If you want to jump, press up or '2' on your keypad. Shooting is assigning to '5.' These are easy to adjust to, and within minutes you'll be cruising the lunar landscape like a Twin Galaxies pro.  That is, until the difficulty ramps up on you, and a multitude of obstacles are thrown at you all at once.  Blasting bomb-dropping UFOs, blowing up space boulders, and leaping over craters of increasing diameter gets tricky as you scoot across later checkpoints. It gets even tougher when Moon Patrol trots out a model of UFO that drop bombs so powerful they make new craters on impact. It's not entirely impossible for two craters to be rendered right next to each other, making jumping and shooting a tricky endeavor indeed.   But even though Moon Patrol gets difficult, it never stacks the deck to much against you. Practice makes perfect, and with a little sweat, you'll beat the game and continue on to even tougher lunar runs. And that's when Moon Patrol gets really fun. Just like the arcade game of yesteryear, you're constantly driven to beat your old record, and you don't mind the minor addiction because the game is so damn fun.  Regretfully, Moon Patrol does not include the hummable, boppity soundtrack from the old coin-op and Atari conversions. You know what we're talking about if you've ever heard it. Sure, you get a little jingle in the beginning, but it hardly compensates. However, Moon Patrol does contains several sound effects for jumping and shooting, which is a welcome change from the eeriely quiet shooters we've been playing of late.  Visually, the game looks pretty much exactly like the old game, just with graphics slight scaled back for what we assume are storage reasons. The animations and sprite movement aren't nearly as smooth as we hoped, but them's the breaks for early cellphone games. Go buy a Game Boy Advance if you just can't handle it. (Actually, go buy a GBA SP anyway--they're cool.) Moon Patrol managed to rekindle an old flame in my heart.  It was one of my favorite Atari 5200 games when I was just a furry lad, and I have quickly logged in several cellphone game hours as I find myself sitting in line for gas at Costco, waiting for the ladyfriend to pick up ~just one thing~ at Target, etc. But those are the moments that cellphone games were created for, and Moon Patrol is one of the worthier time killers you'll find right now.", "date": "Jun 17, 2003"}
