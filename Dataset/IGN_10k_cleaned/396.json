When somebody tries to change up the pace a bit, it's certainly worth noting. But Clock Tower II, like its prequel, is such a step back for gaming in terms of play control that it hardly merits the time a gamer will need  to invest in it just to check it out. Story and Gameplay Even for those who see the PlayStation controller and feel overwhelmed by all the buttons, Clock Tower II's control is overly simplistic. It's not so much a game as it is a point-and-click adventure, like the old PC King's Quest or PlayStation Discworld series. You move from room to room by moving a cursor over to a door and double-clicking on it. Items are interacted with by clicking on them. Nothing happens unless you click somewhere. Aside from the panic situations (where you simply press the escape key rapidly), that's the gameplay. This type of non-interaction brings the gamer screaming back to VGA-era PC gaming. CT II even supports the PlayStation Mouse, which undoubtedly will excite nobody (except possibly the long-forgotten PS Mouse's designer).  This lack of play makes the storyline the most important aspect of the game. Here, the story is the gameplay. Unfortunately, the story is a mixed bag. The set-up contains probably the best horror backstory since Splatterhouse. You play as Alyssa Hale, a seventeen-year-old school girl who, ever since receiving an amulet from her father, has been having horrible visions recently of her murdering her friends and family. And once she awakens from her blackout, she finds that those dreams were true. There is somebody else inside her, some ~cold-blooded, immoral male personality~ named Mr. Bates, and he makes her do things. But as long as Alyssa has her amulet, she is safe from his invasion. Alyssa has just been released from a mental hospital and is staying with a friend of the family. But when she arrives at the Tate home, she makes a gristly discovery-- one that may be her own fault...  Sadly, the storytelling just doesn't live up to gameplay potential. For instance, the premises of the amulet as the gateway to an evil spirit would seem to lead to an innovative experience, as gamers have control over both Alyssa and Mr. Bates. However, the execution is quite off. The only difference between Alyssa and Mr. Bates is that they see different items in a room. What Alyssa misses, Mr. Bates notices. No matter how interesting this may be, the dual personality aspect just leads to repetitive gaming, as you will need to visit each room in the game at least twice (once as Alyssa, once as Mr. Bates) just to see everything. What's more frustration is that the game rarely hides items from the player's view, and so while every door and object is easily noticed by you, the cursor will not allow you to click on an item until you have changed personalities or explored a certain area of the game. For instance, the opening of the game puts you in a house. There is a staircase dead center on the game screen. However, you can't go up the stairs until you've seen everything to be found downstairs first.  This kind of ill-thinking permeates the game. You begin the game by finding the remains of a human body who Alyssa identifies as Ashley. Who's Ashley? I don't know. If you read the manual and watch the opening very closely, you'll notice that the Tates have children (one of them is the demonic devil child that takes the place of ScissorMan as your worst enemy). QED, Ashley must be a Tate daughter. That's a lot of snooping that needs to be done just for back story, and for such an important story point, you would think the game would tell you what the heck's happening. Instead, it leaves you in the dark.  Even the point-and-click interface isn't done that well. Alyssa walks like a runway model; she runs as if she's on ice. Either way, she won't get to where you have just clicked any time soon. When she gets to a door, she has to reposition herself to activate the opening door animation. And, of course, everything action has a specific cinematic to go along with it, which further stretches out the game clock (which impacts your ability to see one of 12 different endings). This is great for sequences where you don't know what will happen next (as you slowly open a cabinet, you never know when something will leap out of it and kill you), but it's another thing entirely when you've accidentally clicked on an empty cabinet and have to watch her slowly open it up to find nothing. Thankfully, there is a feature that you can turn on to skip the animations, but even this has a terminal flaw. The game has Panic Points where you will have to wail on the action button to be able to escape something planning to kill you. Again, a good concept, as your tension level will rise to the breaking point as you desperately try to escape eminent death. However, as soon as the game decided that it won't kill you, the Panic Mode ends and you are shown an escape animation. If you accidentally tap a button during the escape animation (which is just about inevitable since you were turbo-ing just half a second before) , you will skip the escape sequence and the game will go on as if nothing happened. The game robs you of any satisfaction in what is the only truly vicarious thrill of playing the game. Graphics Another mixed bag. The environments are clear and sharp, and they are polygonal, but they also have nothing going on in them. They are flat and lifeless. Rooms do, however, swing and track with your character, and the camera angles are suitable to the horror genre. The environments also look clear in the cinematic sequences, which also make good use of oblique and POV camera angles. They maintain their clarity, but the graphics just aren't that striking. One gripe that I do have about Clock Tower II's environment is that there wasn't a lot of logic used to design the locations. There are about six bathrooms in the game's main house, and the place is just way too Japanese for a game set in Salinas, California. And while a rainy night is a perfect setting for a horror story, it hasn't rained on this coast since they came up with the concept for the movie Chinatown.  The characters fare better, even though their resolution detail isn't too sweet. Alyssa is animated well with smooth motion capture, and she is rather well-acted too. We can see the horror in her facial expression. Other characters are less detailed, but are fittingly stylized. And little Stephanie Tate, who plays the stalker of the game, will bring back some very unpleasant memories of murderous dolls for Twilight Zone fans.  Sound Again, hit and miss. The sound design is pretty well though out, and the atmosphere is constantly frightening. When a knife suddenly flies through the air and buries itself in the cabinet above your head, you will jump. However, the voice acting is pretty miserable at selling the terror. Also, Alyssa is sometimes completely off the script, with line reads that make no sense in context. That is, unless finding your childhood playmate's severed head lying in a suitcase is cause to be mildly startled and slightly alarmed. Even Stephanie isn't that chilling, though it is pretty freaky to pick up a ringing phone and have a little girl's voice say, ~I am going to kill you. Tee-Hee!~ Rumble Feature The sole perfect feature of the game, and almost reason enough to suggest the title. For all of the faults and failures of Clock Tower II, there is nothing to complain about when the rumble is running. The Dual Shock is used so well and so subtle that it often puts the terror back into scenes that you have already experienced. For instance, watch the movie that goes along with this review (terribly sorry for the length, but the plodding nature of the game means that it just takes a long time to show you something). While watching, keep in mind that the Dual Shock is pounding out your heart beat as you are cowering in the closet. As evil Stephanie approaches your hiding spot, it picks up the beat as she gets close and closer to you. You actually skip a beat at one point. Then she is gone, and you feel yourself slowly cool down as the Dual Shock slowly fades away. The vibrating feature is so evenly shaded that you never think of it as a mechanical feature, and it rarely turns the shock all the way up like other games. Very well done.There just is too much potential here and not enough of it realized for me to suggest this title. It's slow as tar, and while there are plenty of frightening moments set in the dark, they aren't nearly as scary as the time my six-fingered uncle came over for dinner. Now that was scary! I wouldn't even mind the pace if the interaction was good and the game drew you in, but the interface is just about as off-putting as possible, and when you are supposed to identify with a character, this is a problem. As a rental, it gets quite a bit more interesting, but you will likely just look up a walk-through just to get through the story rather than plod through the trial-and-error game system. The only reason to buy it is it encourage ASCII to take more chances in creating oddball games that differ from the norm, but in this case, it wasn't worth it.", "date": "Nov 12, 1999"}
