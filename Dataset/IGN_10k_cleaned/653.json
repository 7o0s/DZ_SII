The graphics aren't groundbreaking (in fact, they're not even all that good), and the sound is average at best. But this ugly duckling is hiding an amazingly rich and rewarding platformer with fantastic puzzles and tight control.   Monkey Magic is based on the Japanese cartoon series of the same title. If you haven't seen it, don't worry, you're not privy to the next Pokemon, and trust me that's a good thing. Kongo, a small monkey born from a crashed meteorite is charged with the task of saving his home, Flower Fruit Mountain. Now before you write off Monkey Magic as just another crappy Japanese cartoon-turned game, read on and find out just why this may be one of the best platform games to hit the PlayStation.   Gameplay Right from the get go, Monkey Magic is all about balance. There is a delicate balance system between the magic, level design, puzzles, control and difficulty.   The magic system centers around four different powers, two pairs that counter each other. For example, the fire magic will set your body ablaze, but the ice magic will cool you off, and vice-versa. The other set of magic will either make you strong or shrink, and the counter will always reverse the effect. It's a system that is deceptively simple, yet can be combined to pass a variety of traps, plus you can opt to use the spells on yourself or another object (yes, even enemies).   Speaking of traps, Monkey Magic has some ingenious ones. While they're nothing that hasn't really been done before, the execution of them is fantastic, and creates a difficulty that is perfect for platform experts or novices alike. The abundance of extra lives tends to make the game a little too easy, but again, for less experienced players, it evens the odds.   Tricky jumps and split-second timing are negotiated with a tight, responsive control system. Kongo can perform a double-jump to reach high areas, and can do a little Kung Fu fighting. The different magic powers are cycled though with the L2 and R2 buttons and then either used on Kongo or cast at an object with L1 or R1.   Graphics Unfortunately, this game won't win any awards for graphic prowess. Sure, there are a few nicely executed effects, but the overall look of the game places it somewhere in the second or third generation of PlayStation games. The textures are grainy and have a rather muted color palette, and since there are multiple layers to a level, there are times when everything can seem to blend together, sometimes resulting in an unnecessary death.   Sound Monkey Magic's sound is probably the most neutral of all the areas. While not particularly good, you can't really nitpick either the music or effects. They're there, but not ~in yo face~ there.  Look beyond the plain, muddled graphics and you'll find a gaming gem. This diamond in the rough perfectly harmonizes tight control, slick puzzles, and fantastic level design into one of this year's great platformers. Monkey Magic deserves to be in your collection.", "date": "Jan 26, 2000"}
