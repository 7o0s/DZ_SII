The number of games set in that dark-skied, Blade Runner-inspired, gray-wash, seemingly unavoidable future of ours is staggering. Forget Bush and world-wide rearmament, game-developers are rushing headstrong into our dystopian future and Sony Computer Entertainment America, the maker of C12: Final Resistance, is leading the way. C12 is a somewhat fun, frequently frustrating, ultimately disappointing third-person perspective action-adventure title. Its arrival is an apt swansong for that scene-stalwart, Sony's PlayStation.   Story  The tale goes something like this, though I warn you not to get too caught up. You control resistance fighter Riley Vaughan, an educated English bio-soldier forced to rescue humanity in the face of alien-cyborg-robot hordes. Vaughan has been snatched up by his own military and ~enlisted~ to rescue humanity. Lest he battle in vain and he die like so many of his comrades, Vaughan receives a little extra help from his destitute military. See, Vaughan has a bit of the enemy in him: The military has seen fit to equip him with a robotic eye, giving him handy laser targeting, and a bionic arm helping with overall enemy-dispatching. The story unfolds steadily as Vaughan contacts his allies through radio comms allowing you to follow along. Never too exciting, the story is not important.     Gameplay  The gameplay follows the vibe of the story and keeps things simple. Controlling Vaughan is much like any other third-person game you've played. The left analog stick controls Vaughan's movement as your shoulder and ~shape~ buttons handle all firing, interacting with the environment, navigating menus, etc. Vaughan has all the abilities you'd expect from a hero: he shoots, walks, runs, climbs, crouches, etc. Overall, the configuration works well enough.    Combat is the soup de jour, that's about all you'll be doing. A few ~puzzles~ are there (really just figuring out how to get by a certain environmental obstacle), but in truth they only divert your attention in between battle sequences. Unfortunately, while this is a combat-intensive game, the combat is more often than not too bothersome to hold your interest. While the R1 button enables Vaughan to lock on to an enemy for the ubiquitous auto-aiming, it does not perform as expected. For instance, if Vaughan looks at all away from the enemy he had been locked on to, he loses the lock. Too bad this kind of movement is indeed what you'll be required do again and again, as you'll almost always be fighting numerous aliens at a time. The end result being that you are left running around somewhat aimlessly, firing at whoever ends up being in front of you. If this seems like it could get frustrating, I'm convincing you.    Good God, the camera. I almost don't want to say it, after all this must be the number one complaint concerning third-person games. The camera, while not being a wreck altogether, is much like that of the Tenchu and Tomb Raider series. While it will track Vaughan when he is in wide-open areas, as soon as you bring Vaughan into any room or smaller area, it gets a bitindecisive. As you can see in some of the screens, it hardly makes any effort at all to follow behind Vaughan. Rather, the camera kind of floats around Vaughan, more often than not giving the player a nice shot of his ugly mug. This is not good. Make no bones about it, it is an outright hamper, and in combat (mind what I told you before: combat intensive) it can lead to mounting frustration. C'mon, how many times are players going to have to put up with this one complaint?     Graphics and Sound  I'm not going to waste your time. These are last-generation PlayStation graphics. Pixelation, aliasing, clipping, and slowdown are the norm. I guess you could say that C12 does a good job with the aging power of the PlayStation hardware, though it definitely doesn't touch the benchmark, Metal Gear Solid. On the ups, Vaughan animates well, even if his enemies don't, and the atmosphere rocks. The developers must've put in their Escape from New York viewing time, as dystopia has seldom been expressed this convincingly by 32 bits.   The sound is a bit of a wreck. Why an enemy robot growls like a lion when you shoot it, I don't know. Vaughan's G.I. Joe laser-sounding machine gun doesn't help much either. Much like the graphics, the last-generation sounds are disappointing. There's no music to speak of, save for the rare chase sequences and the title screen which serve up a frantic techno track. C'mon, why rock out on the title screen and then allow us to stew in the boring atmospheric moans and groans for the rest of the game? It's hard for me to recommend this game. It's just not that fun and the camera ruins much of what could be fun. I was repeatedly frustrated trying to kill lame enemies while looking at stale, last-generation graphics. For the PlayStation-only players this game is perhaps worth picking up since these days there's just not that much coming out. However, for anyone with any of the current-generation consoles, forget it. As an aside, if there are any parents reading this, c12 might be a worthy investment for a young'un. Its never too difficult and the atmosphere does rock.", "date": "Aug 1, 2002"}
