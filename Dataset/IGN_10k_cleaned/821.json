Everybody and their mom has put out a mediocre fighter. And while Sega's Virtua Fighter is undoubtedly the first, it wasn't until Battle Arena Toshinden (Toh Shin Den in Japan) that the 3-D realm was taken advantage of. Tamsoft added one little move to the characters' repertoires, and that one little move changed the fighter forever. Behold: the sidestep!  The graphics are also equally impressive. In fact, one might even say they were gorgeous. The backgrounds are nice, and the detail in the characters' faces is exceptional. The game also makes good use of light shading. Not as impressive as, say, Tekken 2, but then again, BAT was part of the PlayStation's initial launch group. The game makes good use of the basic fighter preset - kick, punch, etc.- and throws in a few cool projectiles to boot. Unfortunately, Toshinden does tend to respond a little slowly. And in fighters, that can mean everything.", "date": "Nov 22, 1996"}
