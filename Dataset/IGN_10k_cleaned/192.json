Most people buy the system just to have a portable version of one of the greatest games in existence. Hey, no arguments there. Some designers have taken the challenge on trying their hands at their own take on Tetris -- again, more power to 'em. Klustar is one of those Game Boy titles -- and despite its somewhat hollow feel, you may want to give this game a go, just to see how someone can literally turn Tetris around. Features 16 skill levels Alter cluster size and piece direction Link Cable support for two-players For Game Boy and Game Boy Color   To say this game looks a hell of a lot like Tetris would be an understatement -- and in fact, the Russian puzzle game was definitely Klustar's inspiration. Instead of guiding four block pieces into a bin, you're literally moving the pile. Instead of rotating the piece, you rotate the pile of pieces in four different positions. When the piece lands on the pile, it sticks. The idea is to create clusters of blocks -- when you form a 3x3, 4x4 or 5x5 square cluster, it disappears, and the rest of the squares settle into the middle of the pile, possibly forming more clusters in the process. The game ends when your pile becomes to large to fit on-screen.  There are handicaps to watch out for -- for example, if you fail to make a falling piece stick to your pile, it'll become a dead piece on the edge of the screen that cannot be cleared off. This makes it a lot more difficult to rotate your pile, especially if it's sticking way out to one side.   There are other options in the game to shake up the action, including larger pieces, requiring larger clusters, and changing the direction of which way the piece falls. But even so, Klustar's just as much a one-trick pony as Tetris is, but this one just isn't as fresh and original. You just can't out-Tetris Tetris.  After playing this game for a good few days, I still have yet to figure out how these pieces react when you remove clusters from your pile. Sometimes the blocks will settle in to form more clusters...other times, they'll purposely not stick together, creating hard to reach channels in the process. It's this uncertainty that makes it difficult to get into the game -- most chain reactions are just of the ~did I do that?~ variety.  But what really drags Klustar down a few notches: it may have been released by a professional company and produced by a professional developer, but it's hard to shake the feeling that this was a side project done in a weekend by one of the company's employees. The interface is very minimal, and the music -- one channel renditions of Home on the Range and I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy that sound a heck of a lot like those white-trash mobile home doorbells (ah, the beauty of public domain songs).  It would have been nice to get a little more polish, even if it is a basic Game Boy title.  As far as blatant Tetris rip-offs go, Klustar is one of the most unique. It doesn't have the same addictive quality as the original puzzle stacker, but hey  what does? Klustar is a good diversion, but I found myself reaching for Tetris after playing it -- most likely because it's a reminder just how great the original really is.", "date": "Aug 27, 1999"}
