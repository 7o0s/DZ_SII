In fact, watch the movie today to see just how forward-thinking the creators were. Recently, Disney released a PC sequel to the game, labeled TRON 2.0 to great acclaim. And now Lavastorm Engineering, in conjuction with Disney, has unveiled a 2.0 take on the classic arcade game, Discs of TRON.   Features:   Based on classic movie and updated PC game world  Fractal-based environments  Power-ups and bosses   Discs of TRON is fun. Good fun, too. Now, it could be our serious affinity for the source material talking, but this is one of the better ~licensed~ games we've played in some time. Not only is it visually and conceptually faithful to the classic arcade game, but the 2.0 update elements are perfectly fused to this update.   As soon as you enter the game grid, you'll find yourself staring down wave after wave of enemy programs, all under the command of evil virus Thorne. These tricky programs move around the screen, sometimes taking a disc to the face, other times expertly dodging your throws. AI never feels cheap, and that goes a long way in this intense little game.   You really only need to worry about a few controls. Moving left and right, then fling your disc when the timing is right. Should you be on the receiving end of a disc, press block to deflect the attack. And if you're something special, you can use return fire to neutralize an incoming disc. Discs of TRON is a game that rewards reflexes.   Lavastorm did a remarkable job with the in-game visuals. Discs of TRON looks fantastic. The enemy programs look slick, especially against the fractal-based backgrounds that are practically exploding with color. While the game is based off the classic cabinet, Lavastorm took more visual cues from the Monolith-developed PC game.Discs of TRON is a deceptively simple game. it starts out easy, giving you enough time to acclimate yourself to the controls. But once you have the hang of it, the game ramps of the difficulty severely. But it's never cheap -- the computer seems to fight fair. (Fairer than Sark, at least.) Rewarded with a boos battle at the end, Discs of TRON is a worthwhile investment for mobile players.", "date": "Jun 5, 2004"}
