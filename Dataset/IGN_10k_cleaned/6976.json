Players of Lionhead's The Movies have been waiting patiently for their first. With expansion packs it's always simply a matter of deciding whether it includes enough features to make the game more exciting and fun. The good news is that Stunts and Effects adds a very good amount of new scenes, effects, sets, camera controls, and buildings to the movie making process. There's enough here to please any desktop director and keep your own imaginative process flowing. Those who were hoping for improvements to The Movies sometimes aggravating gameplay mode will have to hope for another expansion in the future. There's little to offer in the way of improvements and some of the new features like stuntmen only add to the micromanagement issues.    The title of the game basically says it all. Nearly all of the additions found in the expansion relate in some way or another to stunts, special effects, or both. This expansion is really for those movie makers looking to add a bit more excitement into their films.   The movie making tools created by Lionhead were already great but the developers have done a terrific job making the movie creation system even more robust.. There are definite limitations involved when creating a product so that players don't actually have to animate sequences themselves, but as robust a tool as this one allows creative players to really express their inner director. Stunts & Effects just increases the number of sets, scenes, and props to do this. A lot of explosions, car wrecks, flying saucers, and other fun effects dominate the new scenes added with the expansion. New sets like the miniature city also have special scenes for monsters or aliens crashing through the city while blue and green screens allow for very customizable sets where tons of props can be used. There really are a lot of awesome additions that players should have fun with here.    Adding even more variety is the new free-cam. While it's not entirely free, it does allow an impressive range of freedom that wasn't there before. The free cam is easily accessed with the click of a button and can be moved around with the WASD or arrow keys with a slider for zoom level. This can create new still camera angles or will allow for different panning shots created by marking a starting and ending point for camera movement. This allows for movement through the whole scene or mere sections. The only challenge with this new feature is making sure that the edges of the sets aren't in frame. Otherwise you can take movies pretty darn far.   Other smaller but fun features are the camera overlay which allows for shots that look like they're taken through goggles, binoculars, cameras, wet glass, muddy glass, and so on. It can create the perfect effect in some cases. Environment has also been updated with more sliders for weather intensity as well as a new wind effect. More costume options, including new sliders to create quick age and weight adjustments, help create more variety as well. Along with the ability to save set dressings, these features can help create more detailed sequences quickly.     The biggest addition in the actual game portion is the addition of stuntmen. These new lot employees specialize in pulling off dangerous scenes. Stuntmen aren't as ridiculously picky as stars are, but they do need attention. In order to increase their stunt skills, they'll need to be put through training in one of three training structures. Every time they train, they'll gain some more skill, just as they'll gain skill by successfully completing a stunt in a film. Should they fail in a stunt, the movie will receive a lower rating and the stuntman (or actor if no stuntman has been assigned) will become injured and need to take a trip to the new hospital for a short stay.   All stunt scenes have a rating indicating how skilled a stuntman or actor needs to be for a chance at being successful. Having a stuntman of high skill becomes especially important when creating scripts with stunts of extreme danger. For instance, an entry level stuntman might be able to pull off a stunt where they simply fall to the floor while expert stuntmen are needed for crazy head on car crashes that fling them headfirst from a moving vehicle.    The problem with the system seems to be that these stuntmen don't live up to their potential. The highest of my stuntmen (stuntwoman actually) was often not able to pull off even the most meager of stunts with a skill level that should have been able to pull off everything but the most difficult situation. None of the stuntmen were able to complete 100% of the easy stunts no matter how highly trained they were.   Thankfully none of these stuntman mistakes are ever actually caught on film so that players focusing on movie making don't have to worry that the movie will be ruined. In fact, all of the stunts are pulled off to perfection in the movie maker and can lend a real bit of excitement to movies that wasn't there before.   Sadly, very little of the simulation gameplay has been improved. Workers still can't be given areas to work in, stars still take an impossibly long time to become friends, and most importantly, there's still a major lack of potential employees waiting to be hired.So it really simply comes down to whether you're planning to play The Movies as a simulation game or use it as a creative tool. All of the additional creative sets, scenes, and the rest are certainly going to appeal to any movie maker. The same goes for the addition of the free-camera system and nifty new special effects. There's some really wonderful additions that should push any films to a new level of excitement which make it very easy to recommend picking this up if what you want is more robust options for making movies.The same can not be said for the gameplay. The game still suffers from occasionally excessive micromanagement and continues its imposition of awkward limitations. And  while the newest addition of stuntmen doesn't particularly make the situation worse, it certainly doesn't help either.", "date": "Jun 9, 2006"}
