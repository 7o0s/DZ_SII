{"name": "Quest: Brian's Journey", "name_review": "Quest: Brian's Journey", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/16/quest-brians-journey", "text": "When your RPG is set in a peaceful land where nothing bad ever happens, the villagers who you meet are constantly telling you about who they think is cute rather than giving you clues on how to save the world (if it is indeed in need of saving -- in this case it doesn't for 90% of your journey), and your lead character is named Brian... Face it, your RPG is in trouble. Those who loved the game battle mechanics in Quest 64 will enjoy some aspects of this game, but in all other respects this is the most generic RPG ever made.  Features:  Available for Game Boy and Game Boy Color. Innovative battle sequences. Multiple lands and towns to explore. 20+ hour quest. A protagonist named Brian (Hey, not many RPGs can say that!)    The plot of this game seems like a Monty Python film -- a quiet, peaceful town is suddenly, or rather not so suddenly if you prefer, overrun by villains of all sorts of evilry, and the entire town has entrusted their faith and livelihoods on a dumpy looking fellow named -- wait for it -- Brian! Everybody else in the game has some fantasy name like Organshia or Beigis or Shannon... OK, maybe not Shannon, although if it was Shannen then she would be a mystical character just like Shannen Doherty on Charmed. But I digress... So Brian, or Brian the Great, or just plain Brian if you're feeling superior (which is fairly likely unless your name is Brian) is sent on a quest. To do what? Who cares, because in these parts it's just fun to quest! Yep, questin' is like kickin' it in the land of Celtland. And lucky Brian gets to be the big guy who saves the world... Just as soon as it comes into crisis, which is about eighty hours into this ten hour game. But I digress again.  And digress I should, because the plot of this game is so cack that it completely precludes involvement from players. In the first five minutes of gameplay, the gallant Brian is sent to his room and put to bed. Viva el hero! Eventually, Brian is sent on his eponymous quest (for absolutely no reason, although eventually he stumbles on an impending apocalypse which he figures needs stopping or else something might happen. Villagers (with amazingly convoluted and unimportant names) keep asking Brian how the quest is going. In other games, the villagers can see the Four Horsemen of Judgement Day descending from the heavens and are afraid for their lives. But here, when one says ~I can't believe you're going on a quest!~, you get the feeling that they're really just amazed that somebody's actually getting out of this two-horse empire and doing something with their lives.   And what a quest it is! At one point, the magical Water Stone -- which you have braved countless obstacles and battled fiercely into the mouth of hell to retrieve for the sake of all your charges -- breaks. It simply breaks. So in a matter of about fifteen minutes, Brian just goes and gets another. Apparently the lone saving grace of this pathetic kingdom comes in a six-pack at the local Five & Dime.  It's really too bad that this game has no personality, because the battle mechanics aren't half bad. Oh sure, the power-ups refill your magic and hit points by an overflowing 300 points when players may never boost their stats beyond 100, and yes the key to battle is avoiding the graphic effects in attacks rather than strategically combating opponents, but the ideas are there. If you are familiar with the Nintendo 64 game, you will be pleasantly surprised to know that the gameplay is intact. Brian can move about between turns, dodge attacks as they come, and combine magic spells into special attacks. The system is deep and offers many directions to take a battle, but players will find that only a few spells really work in their favor. If Sunsoft and Imagineer had taken this translation in the Working Designs direction (filling it with all kinds of American jokes), then maybe I would have cared about Brian's epic quest. But without engaging characters, an interesting storyline, or even a simple reason to actually play the game, it has got nothing worth interest. And even though the battle system is innovative, the constant random battles quickly wear out this battle system's welcome. An average game in every way, and a disappointment after such an interesting magic and fighting system. But what do you expect from a guy named Brian?", "date": "Feb 16, 2000"}
