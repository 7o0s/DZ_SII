As the title of the group implies, they're the special forces of the police, deployed in hostile situations where regular police tactics simply won't work. They're highly trained in close combat and non-lethal submission of armed subjects. They have the weapons to kill, but prefer less lethal tactics to avoid unnecessary death of suspects or civilians stuck in the middle. SWAT teams often enter unfamiliar territory without confirmation of enemy numbers or armament, making for extremely dangerous situations. Irrational's new addition to the venerable SWAT franchise does a brilliant job of picking up on all of the things that make SWAT work so exciting from the outside perspective. They've created some amazing levels that force team tactics along a super fun multiplayer experience for a few reasons. Friendly AI can be a problem from time to time in the single player game, but this is definitely one tactical shooter that I won't hesitate to recommend.   Graphically, SWAT 4 is very good. It can almost hold its own with nearly any of the big shooters out there at the moment, not because of any particularly great technical achievment (it doesn't have that), but because the art team and level designers put an excessive amount of detail into all of the environments. Irrational was going for realistic ~lived in~ spaces and they did that perfectly. These environments are filled with all sorts of odd items that you would expect to see in each of these locations. They didn't stop with the stacked crates or simple cubicles here; these areas were brought to life with extra bits of paper, trash, food, puddles, lamps, construction materials, furniture... you name it. It may seem like stuff you've seen before, but you've never seen it such a large variety of objects in such quantities.   There are some less than spectacular things like clipping, mirrors that look more like monitors showing a feed rather than a true reflection, enemy models really that aren't brilliant (big frog hands as Tal says), and animations that miss their targets, but overall, this is a great visual look. Many of the environments are creepy and dark which help build tension as well. All these things not only massage the eyes with kindness but also help create more exciting gameplay. When you walk into a room that seems to have a real purpose (outside of providing an interesting game environment) things get really tense. Cans and chairs begin to look like heads and bodies, office cubicles are just tall enough so you can't see around them and create a ton of hidden nooks and corners, and doorways sprout in all directions. Extra care has to be taken to cover all vulnerable angles. Frankly, I can't imagine actually going into areas like this in real life with no more information than a map scrawled on a napkin and a ~there are at least five heavily armed terrorists inside~ without actually crapping myself.      When you deal with AI that will actively run away and even try to surround you in flanking maneuvers, things get even better. I can't say that the AI in SWAT 4 is the best I've ever seen, but they certainly like to take cover, hide, and wait for you to do something incredibly stupid. The best thing about the enemy AI is that all of them have sliding scales of both skill and morale. When you get a highly skilled enemy with fanatic level morale, chances are, blood is going to be spilled by somebody. They'll wait, run for cover, and pop you when you think the area is clear.   Because the game is a realistic tactical shooter, you're going to find that getting shot is a really bad idea. Even heavy body armor seems to provide limited cover. I suppose you get shot enough with anything and you'll go down. My main problem with enemy AI is that they seem to be incredible shots much of the time. I've been picked off by a low level thug in one shot with heavy armor on (meaning I was popped in the brain).   Friendly AI in the single player game unfortunately has more problems than enemy AI. I've found that it works well most of the time, but occasionally, it seems to have a complete lapse in attention or judgment. Some orders will be completely ignored while others will be carried out immediately. Sometimes the team will bust into a room on command and take down everybody with enough efficiency to be impressive while other times they'll run straight past an enemy looking to cover a certain area of the room only to get shot in the back of the head.    The biggest problem with the AI is the inconsistency with which they enter a room on breach. In the couple of hours I had with SWAT members training press in real life tactics a while back, they had us move into a room inches apart from each other through the door so that all guns would be entering and covering all points of the room as close to simultaneously as possible. AI room clearing behavior just isn't like that in SWAT 4. Oftentimes two team members will be in there engaging the bad guys while the other two are just starting to move through the door. I would have liked to see that procedure a little tighter as it can be the difference between a successful clearing and a disaster.   The good news is that when things work right (and that really is most of the time), it's an exciting thing to be part of. Actually giving the commands is simple as pie. Keyboard shortcuts for SWAT 3 players are an option along with the new right click context sensitive menu system that's simple, efficient, and fun to use. They've even implemented a few different styles of using that right click menu system for different types of players. The great thing about the interface is that using the menu system isn't even necessary half of the time. Simply pointing at an object will bring up default quick options. For example, pointing the reticule at a suspect that has given up will bring up the ~Restrain~ command, which can then be carried out by simply hitting the space bar.   Using different tools can be just as easy. Walking up to a door will offer up several options depending on where the reticule is pointing. Point at the lock and a breach icon will appear. Point to the crack between the ground and the door and the option to either jam the door with a stopper or use the Optiwand surveillance tool will present itself. Simply holding down the fire button (default left mouse) will cause the context item to be used even if not actively equipped. As you might expect, context icons will only appear if that piece of equipment is actually in your inventory.   Picking out the right inventory is part of the strategy as well. There are several different weapons that range in size and deadliness to go along with quite a few tactical devices like the door wedge and stinger grenades. Finding the right combination for your team, whether in single or multiplayer, is part of the fun. A briefing is presented before each mission that will give some clue as to what you can expect from the encounter such as whether the suspects will be heavily armed, armored, or have gas masks. Judging from information given beforehand, a loadout for the team can be planned for the most effective strike.     My childhood days were filled with entertaining games of different sorts, but cops and robbers was always a favorite. There was something just and right about pointing a gun-like stick at a friend and saying ~bang~ with all the authority a five year old can muster. A child's recreation of the real thing lacks quite a few touches of reality, one of the most important being restraint. ~Bang, you're dead~ doesn't quite have much of a meaning to a child that doesn't understand death or real violence. Police officers have much stricter restrictions when it comes to deploying deadly force. Irrational Games wanted to make sure that SWAT 4 had plenty of solutions for a less lethal approach to directing incursions into volatile situations that were being put into practice by active SWAT teams.   Weapons like the less-lethal shotgun (less, not non), pepper ball gun (a paintball gun repurposed to shoot paintballs filled with pepper spray at high velocities), the Taser stun gun, flashbang grenade, CS gas grenade, and Stinger grenade (full of hard rubber balls that shoot out at high speeds in all directions causing severe pain and disorientation) can all be used to take down suspects or subdue civilians that are freaking out without having to actually fire a bullet.   SWAT 4's missions are actually balanced to encourage the use of non-lethal force. The more people you keep alive, the higher score you get. However, this makes using the less-lethal shotgun almost required. Suspects with high morale tend not to respond to screams of ~drop your weapons~ all the time unless they're getting pelted with beanbags or pepper balls. Shooting bullets in the air sometimes works, but there's no pistol whip option (which all of us here would have liked) and shooting a suspect in the leg is almost as likely to kill them as cause them to give up. Locational damage has been implemented (you can see enemies limp away and your own aim will decrease if shot in the arm) but it still doesn't keep a guy from dying when shot in the leg, which seems a bit silly to me. I understand there are some big arteries in there that can be damaged, but immediate death?    We've all been having a blast around the office playing all of the different modes but the drug of choice has been the coop multiplayer. There's just something special about teaming up with a four of your friends and going into a crazy situation and having to watch each other's backs. This is definitely a mode for friends to play together. When you all coordinate an attack from two doors into the same room at the same time, there's something undeniably satisfying about the whole process. Timed breaches, flahsbangs and gas grenades going off, exclamations (many of which we can't repeat on this site) of pain and surprise, forceful shouts of ~Drop your weapon or I'll drop you!~ coming from all angles, targets being hit with bean bags and pepper balls, and gunfire from enemies strong enough to withstand the immediate threat all create an atmosphere perfect for friendly play. The only problem we've encountered during these moments is an occasional sound glitch that causes those dropping their weapons to stutter. Either way, I believe the missions really should be played in cooperative mode to be fully appreciated. Not only are the levels themselves well designed, but the randomly generated enemies make sure you don't know where they'll be each time you go through a mission. No more memorizing of enemy locations. You really do have to stick your Optiwand under each door and be careful around every corner if you want to survive no matter how many times you've played.   On the other end of the multiplayer spectrum is competitive play. While the options are limited here as far as game types go, the ones included are a lot of fun. The typical team deathmatch (with the twist of being able to arrest your enemies to embarrass them more) is joined by VIP Escort and Rapid Deployment. All are team-based games (I'm guessing because they didn't want SWAT guys running around shooting each other) where SWAT combats the Suspects. VIP Escort has the SWAT team trying to escort one of their own members across the map to a select location while the suspects converge, try to hold him captive for two minutes, and then assassinate him. It's a tricky game that definitely focuses the action in an area and forces players to be careful about their fire. Kill the VIP before time and the game is lost. Rapid Deployment challenges SWAT members to find and disarm several bombs around a level before the time runs out. Bombs have to be found by listening for the beeping sounds. Bomb locations are randomized each play through so that both the SWAT and Suspect teams have to find them before disarming or defending. All of the game types are certainly fun. The tension of a realistic style shooter makes sneaking and careful movement more important than in a regular shooter. Run speed is not like Quake or even Counter-Strike here. Teamwork is a huge priority, as it should be, and wins more satisfying as a consequence.    SWAT 4 is a terrific game from a company that simply keeps gaining trust in my mind. Irrational has created a terrific addition to a series of games that has been much loved over the years. They've managed to make non-lethal tactics both important and fun with great sound bytes, exciting tactics, and a good selection of weapons. Of course, those wanting a heavily armed SWAT experience can have it as well even though it seems tougher to get through a mission without killing anyone.Levels are designed smartly and provide an exciting experience every time they're played through. Multiplayer options such as cooperative play and competitive team play will certainly extend the life of this game along with the quick mission editor for a different single player experience in any of the single player mission maps.If you've been looking for a new tactical shooter that provides both good single player and excellent multiplayer experiences, SWAT 4 is it.", "date": "Mar 31, 2005"}
