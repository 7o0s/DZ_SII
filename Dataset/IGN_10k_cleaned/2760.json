Every subsequent extreme sport game has had to endure comparison to the papa of all extreme titles.  Whether it is dirt biking, skateboarding, inline skating, or even racing in Sea-Doos, no extreme sports title is safe from the inevitable comparison.  This shouldn't come as any big shock, but Infogrames' Splashdown is no Tony Hawk.  Originally a PS2 game eight months prior, Splashdown for Xbox received a couple of new tracks and some graphical tweaks, but little else in the way of change.     FeaturesTwenty tracks including new tracks not found in the PS2 version  Pull off crazy tricks on your Sea-Doo  Shortcuts to help you get an edge on opponents  Split-screen multiplayer racing  Customizable soundtracks    Gameplay  You're a Sea-Doo master, looking to beat the pants off other riders through a variety of tracks located across the globe.  Your career begins choosing one of a handful of riders, each with their own unique attributes.  Progressing through a series of races against four AI-controlled racers unlocks new levels and new riders.  After every four or five races, you are allowed a challenge round where you choose a rider to race on tracks that look like part of a water amusement park attraction.  Beat the rider and they join your team.  Lose and you get to select ~retry~ and do it all over again.   The Sea-Doo is pretty easy to control.  The A button accelerates and the B button, right and left triggers are used to pull off different tricks.  To speed up on straight-aways (or, if you've got the stones, through turns), just pull back on the left thumbstick to hydroplane.  Less Doo in the water equals less resistance, which means more speed for you.  If you like getting wet, you can push forward to submarine in the water.  This clever maneuver gets you under hazardous objects or into various shortcuts.  A quick version of the submarine has you dunk and pull up sharply, allowing you to bunny hop over objects or riders.   Once in the air, tricks are performed with a the directional pad (or left thumbstick) and either B, left trigger, or right trigger.  Combos can be simple like left and B or more complex like up-down and right trigger.  Holding a trick increases points, but if you're not seated by the time the Sea-Doo meets the water, you'll be swimming with flipper.  Tricks are necessary to fill your performance meter.  As the meter fills, your Sea-Doo becomes more reliable--faster, with better handling and better jumps.  Bail or stop doing tricks and the performance meter diminishes, costing you an important edge over your opponents.      Pulling off tricks, landing on other folks' noggins and knocking 'em off their Sea-Doos can be a blast.  Tricks are easy, for the most part, but no-less enjoyable to watch.  It's hard to concentrate sometimes on the idea of a race when you're busy looking for the next ramp to jump off of, the next stunt to pull.     Though Splashdown races are on fixed tracks, there are always multiple splits on each track.  There are also shortcuts, though they are usually only one or two for each track.  The shortcuts don't always help, unfortunately.  You might think it's cool to dip under the waterfall, head through the cavern, and take a big leap off the lip, but it's not so cool when you see your less adventurous opponents pass by anyway.  What's the point of a shortcut that offers no benefits other than a slight visual diversion?   At first the tracks in Splashdown are a bit too short, but as new tracks are opened, the length increases, offering a tad more excitement.  The way the competition is divided is a bit confusing, though.  Some tracks require you to finish second out of five, others fifth out of five.  Yes, fifth out of five racers.  You just have to finish the race to continue.  Take an hour, take a day--finish and you move on.  This is cool if it's the first few tracks, but the condition actually shows up far later in the career mode, and not even on one of the tougher tracks.     It's a bit puzzling why one track requires a second place finish and another a third, fourth, or even fifth to move on because most of the tracks feature the same level of difficulty.  This uneven distribution makes the game feel less organized than it should be and a bit anticlimactic at points.  The only other challenge during races is to find the unlockable costume icons strewn about.  Most tend to force you off your path, making it difficult to get the icon and win the race.  But all you need do is finish the race with the icon collected to unlock the new costume.  So, you just have to hit the old ~retry~ to start over.   This isn't to say that Splashdown's not fun, because it is enjoyable.  But it's an arcade presentation without enough arcade elements to make it a smashing success.  Tricks only service you in filling your performance meter during races, but there's no bonus for scoring a ton of points in career mode.  And Splashdown is missing something almost every other extreme sports game has--stat improvement.     No matter how good you do, your rider doesn't gain points to distribute among their attributes.  The only way to get better is to challenge stronger riders in the challenge rounds, beat them and use them to further your quest for a championship.  This makes it tough to do the old ~play through the game one time with each character, leveling them up until they are each almighty riders.~  And that's sort of what career mode is supposed to be, isn't it?   Splashdown is fun, but it lacks the difficulty and depth that made the Wave Race series so successful.  There are a few levels with big waves, but for the most part it feels like the game could just have easily been on a dirt bike.  The water is rarely against you, which is a shame because that's what makes a sea-faring racing game different from all the rest.     If you have friends, and we'll assume you do or may in the future, you can bust out a little multiplayer.  The multiplayer is pretty simple.  Split-screen two-player racing either through a specific number of laps or in free race mode, where time is endless.  Split-screen can go horizontal or vertical, but you'll want the default horizontal split here.  Multiplayer is really, uh well, boring.  There's nothing tense about the races and without the reward of unlock anything, it just has no kick to it.    Graphics  Everyone loves pretty water effects, and Splashdown has plenty to ooh and ahh over.  The water is gorgeous, but the splash effects are rather weak.  Nothing kills the beauty of reflective water more than cheap looking splashes and wake effects.  There's some clipping here and there, but nothing too obnoxious.  The animations are smooth without a hint of slowdown, but the levels could have had so much more.     Taking the names of real places like Loch Ness and the Rhine River, Splashdown does its best to have cool environments.  Some work, like the floating junkyard, but others should have been more.  I can't tell you how many hours I spent just on Loch Ness, hoping to find a way to bring forth the monster resting within, but not once did I spot Nessie.    The designers chose to lose more realistic elements, and made the water physics arcadey.  So if it is an arcade-type game, shouldn't the tracks be more than just pretty water with minimal scenery?     Sound  The one thing Splashdown has going against it, is that it's an old game.  Even when it came out eight months ago for PS2, some of the tracks seemed tired.  Now, many moons later, does anyone really ever want to hear Smash Mouths' All Star??  There are plenty of tracks here and some are good others are worth avoiding.  Good thing Infogrames made use of the Xbox Hard drive, allowing customizable soundtracks.  Phew.   The sound effects in Splashdown are almost negligible.  Aside from the whine of the Sea-Doo, the main sound comes from cranky riders trying to talk smack to one another.  There could have been a lot more smack talk here, but what is there ain't bad.  The SFX are really toned down though, probably because the idea is to let the soundtrack dominate the sound field.     While the game doesn't add anything new to the genre, it's got enough fun to make it enjoyable for a few passive hours on the couch.  This will definitely appeal to those who felt Wave Race was too difficult or demanding.  Still, Splashdown's too conservative.  If you're going to be an arcade racer with wacky characters and over-the-top tricks, then you can't pull any punches.  There's very little in the environments to make you go ~wow!~ or ~zoinks!~ or ~holy schnozzle!~  And there's not enough tricks to keep them interesting forever.  There's certainly enough here to carry you through all of the tracks and finish up a championship, but will it keep you coming back for more a month later?  Probably not.", "date": "Jun 24, 2002"}
