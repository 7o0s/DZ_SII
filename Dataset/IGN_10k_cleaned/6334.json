You can see maybe why Nintendo opts to keep their prized games off of the platform -- some of the best handsets can hold their own against the Game Boy. However, even though Sony has it's own portable gaming rig, the PSP, it apparently feels no competition from the mobile arena. A month ago, JAMDAT released an excellent mobile edition of Sony's SOCOM, and now Sony themselves has unleashed their own mobile entry in the Ratchet & Clank franchise.   Honestly, I think I may be enjoying Ratchet & Clank Going Mobile more than I am Ratchet: Deadlocked. It's a classic 2D-style platformer full of all of the running, jumping, and shooting action that fueled gaming in the late eighties to mid-nineties. And for an old-timer like me, that's the sweet spot. Ratchet & Clank unfolds over seventeen pretty good-sized levels. The story involves poor R&C getting all small'd down after a blast from Microcorp's Biological to Digital Matter transfer Computer. Now they're essentially trapped in your cellphone, and you have to help them out. It's clever way to make the platform part of the game, even if it is a minor thing.   The platforming is augmented by the use of a few neat bits of kit, such as Ratchet's grappling hook, which is easily deployed when you approach a green grapple spot. You can grind rails with your new boots. And Clank can use rotor blades to give you a little extra lift when necessary.    It's just not a Ratchet & Clank game without a boatload of weapons, and this mobile edition does not disappoint. Gravity Bombs, the Defragmenter, the wrench, a mini-rocket -- these are just some of the tools you are issued for the job. Then there's the silly stuff, such as Boarzooka, that turns enemies into swine. Much like previous Ratchet & Clank games, you can collect buts and bolts to use at shops and upgrade weapons for improved performance. But if you want the real hardware, you need to play through the game's levels a second time and find all of the hidden Titanium Bolts. Only after grabbing all of these goodies do you receive the ultimate weapon: RYNO. This stands for Rip You a New One, and it's an apt acronym for such a powerful blaster.   But after playing through the whole game a couple times to get such a cool weapon, will you actually be inspired to go through it a third time just to use it? This is where the Arena Mode comes into play. There are twelve individual arena challenges with some clever conceits, such as finishing a level before an infection zeroes out health, or just the need to blow everything up. These add some solid replay value to already great game.   Ratchet & Clank looks great. I've played the game on both an LG VX8000 and a Nokia 6620. Both looked bright and crisp. The sprites for our heroes are sharp, with solid detail and a good amount of animation. The backdrops are also well drawn and laid out. I also liked the easy-to-use hub screen for level selection. Ratchet & Clank has a slick theme and good in-game effects.  I've often warned against developers just trying to shove a console game into a mobile phone -- the results can be mixed, or just straight up bad. But Ratchet & Clank, and a few other recent titles, are excellent blueprints for how to make the jump. Find the essence of the game -- in Ratchet & Clank's case, weapons -- and go for a game play style that makes sense. Ratchet & Clank Going Mobile opts for a traditional platformer, and it's the right decision, just like the turn-based battles in DOOM RPG were smart choices. Definitely download this one.", "date": "Nov 11, 2005"}
