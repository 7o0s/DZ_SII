Yes, I'm talking about the old-school shooters and of them Gradius was about as cool as it got. Getting through the game required some extreme pattern memorization and intense hand-eye coordination. Now, 18 years later, Gradius V has landed on the PS2 and that hardcore feel is still intact with some sweet new graphics. While still a daunting experience for those who are used to life bars, there is plenty for those who want a challenge.   For both good and bad, barely anything has changed with the basic goings-on here. The action takes place in a 2D plane as a spaceship flies around and tries to clear out everything in its path on the way to the big bad boss creatures that are lying in wait. Groups of enemies attack in waves and fly in formation while gun turrets fire from their places on the ceiling or the floor. Some of them just move around while others fire off slow-moving bullets. Either way, touching absolutely anything results in an exploding death. The only salvation here is a shield or some finely tuned reflexes.   Like all of the games in the series, Gradius V features a power-up system that cycles through a menu of choices. By picking up one icon (unleashed by destroying a wave of enemies or select red ones) it's possible to get a speed boost by selecting it. If instead a different choice is desired, then it's a matter of picking up more power-ups to cycle through the missile, double shot, laser, multiple, or shield, in that order. The multiple is an option to gain up to four glowing orbs (traditionally known in the series as ~options~) that shoot at the same time as the main ship and are crucial to getting anywhere in the game. While the other power-ups disappear upon dying, these options will remain on the screen in a ghostly form and can be regained to keep up the momentum.    Without mastering the use of the options, playing in Gradius V will become an exercise in futility. It's only by keeping a few around, preferably all four, that it's possible to get through the game to see the end. There are also some variances in the option usage since there are four different types of ships that can be used. Each ship has some differences in the missiles and the double shot as well, but it's really the options that make the big difference.    Normally, the options follow the same path as the ship so that by moving up and down players can create a wall of bullets or they can move left and right to get them all aligned for some quintuple firepower action. This time the R1 button is used to change them around. One ship can change the direction of the options shooting while another can lock the options in place. Yet another can expand or contract a formation while the last one can cycle the options around the ship. Many of these tactics are helpful not only in attacking enemies, but providing a virtual shield with firepower that destroys enemies approaching from all directions.   While four different types of ship may seem a bit sparse, and it is, they still provide a few options of approaching the different levels and are easy to use as opposed to some more complicated shooters like R-Type Final. Still, I couldn't help but wish for some more ways of going through the game. Even the option to shoot in any direction needs a little work. The left analog stick is used for movement, but the only way to turn the options around is to hold down R1 and then use the left analog to change direction. This means that the ship can't move while the options do.      With one button to shoot and one to tweak the options this simplifies things, but one wishes that more than two buttons could have been used here. There's also a curious lack of any right analog usage. With dual analog control, the game could have become more versatile, but the real spirit here is for those hardcore fans of shooters who will be amply rewarded for their purchase.   If the thought of navigating through fields of slow-moving bullets is appealing to you, then this game will be right up your alley. With eight stages that are filled with some tight combat scenarios there is a lot to practice on and try out. While the first four stages are pretty standard fare, by the time Gradius V gets to the fifth stage there are entire asteroid fields to weave through and the sixth stage ups the ante even more with liquid that pours around as the entire level turns different directions.    To top it off, all the action has been given a major graphical upgrade and there are some deluxe graphics that make the whole game look amazing. While the gameplay is still 2D, all of the models in the game are three dimensional and instead of the traditional black background there are entire universes and spinning spaceships to fill up the screen. All this and the game still runs silky smooth with no slowdown at all. Here, it's all about the fast action.   In the Gradius V experience there is barely any downtime at all with new enemies popping up constantly and providing a continuous challenge from beginning to end. The skill of weaving through a constantly changing world is one of the largest requirements here. Thankfully, the hitbox for the ship (the pixels that determine collision) has been shrunk down to a fraction of the ship itself. This means that even though it may not look like there is a lot of wiggle room for some narrow escapes there is actually some space to truly work with.    This last part is key since there will be lots of times when the environment will be closing off paths or opening tiny new ones that need to be sped through with precision. Make no mistake, Gradius V is all about playing stages over and over to master the different patterns of the stages and getting the safest route down and honing one's reaction times in order to make all the rapid-fire movements that are needed.    Playing through will also require plenty of clever ways of using one's options to attack all of the different targets. While the bullets and lasers mostly fire right the attacks can come from all directions. With the exception of the one ship that can change shooting directions this makes the game become an exercise in moving the ship into an odd location so that the guns can finally hit the targets. This gets even stranger when enemies start attacking from the left. It's a unique experience of trying to maneuver an outdated shooting system with a variety of targets that take advantage of the ship's own blind spots. With all of the improvements in place, Gradius V has refined the shooter as far as it can go and it has pushed its own genre onto the PS2 with some admirable results. All the same, there is little to make such a game appealing to those who don't find the idea of billions of options for instantaneous death exciting. This game may be more accessible than some of the other shooters out there in terms of control, but the appeal lies largely in trying out the same complex situations over and over and trying to get a high score. There is certainly a sense of accomplishment for beating such a game, but it's a style of gameplay that firmly keeps the genre unto a tight little niche of its own.", "date": "Sep 15, 2004"}
