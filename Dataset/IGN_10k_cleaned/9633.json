The same development team as the previous Need for Speed DS continues to push its handheld skills to produce an even better racing game, the Nintendo DS edition of Need for Speed ProStreet. Even with the slight quirks that pop up here and there, the DS version gets the thumbs up. It's still not enough to convince gamers to spend that earmarked cash for the DS version over the console editions, but as an on-the-go racer you could do much worse.   It's hard to ignore the fact that Need for Speed ProStreet is a steady and noticeable improvement over last year's game, Need for Speed Carbon. Okay, one feature got the axe: customizable vinyl decals. While the lack of a paint program to doodle profanities and phallic symbols all over your vehicle is certainly a bummer, we can certainly forgive it for all the work the development team - Exient, the unsung Nintendo DS heroes --  put into its second Need for Speed DS project.   Much of the game has been built on the foundation that is the team's Need for Speed Carbon project. Need for Speed ProStreet uses the same D-pad control of last year's game, an ~emulation~ of analog control where players can weaken or strengthen their left or right turning by using the D-pad's diagonals. Exient learned that fuzzy dice leaning left and right on a virtual dashboard isn't really the best way of using the lower screen in a racing game, so now it's simply used for displaying important details: a dynamic track map, damage meters, and other racers' positions on the mapand the modes can be easily swapped in with a simple tap of the screen.    The Nintendo DS game still lacks that console polish and still puts all the different racing challenges - from its standard circuit racing to its drag racing challenges to its slippery slide-around-the-corners drift modes - into a much more straightforward experience. Visually the game's both a step up and a step sideways from Carbon: track detail is higher at the expense of a reduction in framerate (30 frames versus Carbon's 60), and car detail is a bit glossier this time. The vehicles look more toylike now because of it. There aren't any icing-on-the-cake extras like instant replays, eitherthough there's now a neat Prince of Persia-like rewind function to fix a screw-up on the fly. The licensing money EA forked out for the console games carries over: the Nintendo DS cartridge is absolutely filled with licensed music, and the line-up of cars and tracks is a solid, if just a little incomplete sampling from the big boy's edition.   As far as DS standards go, this is one darn good racer.   But there are some exclusive Nintendo DS moments. The oddest, and ultimately most out of place and unnecessary inclusion is ProStreet's Hydraulics game mode. Show off your car's bounciness by partaking in yet another rhythm game based upon the selection of licensed tunes within the cartridge. As completely out of place as this mode is, it's an interesting and different way of pulling off the ~Dance Dance Revolution~ clone without being a clone itself. Sure, you have to tap the proper buttons to the beat of the song, but the way the visual cues come sliding across the screen can get a little hectic and just a little overwhelming. At the very least it's not going to be a cakewalk the first few times you try.   But yes, ProStreet's strengths is its actual racing engine, not its rhythm game. What's good about the Nintendo DS game is its tight control and its weighty vehicles. Each of the dozen or so licensed vehicles actually behaves differently from one another. Some are lighter and handle corners better, some are zippy but turn like crap. The addition of the usual and expected customization options enable players to tweak their cars for peak performance, which is absolutely an important thing to take advantage of since many races don't equalize the competition. Don't be surprised if you're left in the dust if you're simply using stock versions of the available vehicles.   This remains absolutely true when you compete against actual human components. Multiplayer is a definite strongpoint in the ProStreet product, as made evident by the focus on single cartridge multiplayer for as many as eight players. The compromise is, naturally, everyone's on equal footing since they're using the same stock car as the host system. Where the real competition comes from is in using the custom cars unlocked and tweaked in the career mode, and that can be used in either local wireless when every game has its own cartridge, or in ProStreet's Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection support for four player online races.   Multiplayer may be a strength in the overall product, but a lot of the visual glitches seem to pop up when in these races. At least in the few online races we experienced confusing jittering of the opponent's vehicles, going from driving in reverse to forward in an instant. This happened in a lesser extent in our local wireless sessions, but they were still there.The Nintendo DS is not lacking in racing games, and it's certainly not lacking in good racing games: Mario Kart DS is still among the tops, and this holiday season alone has seen the release of the impressive Race Driver: Create and Race hit the system. But when it comes to conversions of console racers (or any game for that matter), even if the game's impressive for Nintendo DS standards, it's hard to make the argument to spend the dough on the portable version over the PlayStation/Xbox/Wii editions. Need for Speed ProStreet ended up a really good product on the Nintendo DS. It's a modest success with its fair share of pros and a handful of cons, but for the most part the development team's showing that it's getting more comfortable with the DS platform with every project it helms.", "date": "Nov 27, 2007"}
