The game had you running through dungeons, killing everything in your path, and then moving to the next location.  Not exactly rocket science if you know what I mean.  Xbox owners now have the chance to play through one of last years best games, but the question is, has anything changed or improved, and is the game still worth your time almost a full year after its initial release?     Gameplay  Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance is a top-down hack-and-slash game set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe.  It is also the first game to use the 3rd edition Dungeons and Dragons rule set.  While many players could care less about this, let alone know what it means, playing the game with an older rule set would drastically change the way the game plays.  Some of the major changes in the 3rd edition rule set include how stat points are increased, an end to race-based limits (like strength, dexterity, etc...), armour-class calculation, and reorganization of saving throws.  There are others, but this topic is clearly out of scope for this review.  I mention them only because, whether you're aware of it or not, they do affect the gameplay.  Imagine having your level capped off at a certain point for the duration of the game because of what class your character is.  That could make for some interesting moments.   Going back to the topic here, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance starts off with you choosing one of three characters: Human archer, Dwarven fighter, or Elven sorceress.  Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses, and provides a differing gaming experience.  Better yet, you can play through the game with a friend in two-player co-op mode.  There's nothing better than to have a friend along as you slash your way through hundreds of monsters.  Already played through half the game and decided you want to play with a friend?  No problem.  Just pause the game and add another player.  You can then continue your game right there with a friend, the downfall being that their character will not have any items or have leveled up.  But there is a solution.  You can actually import a character from someone else's game into your game off a memory card or off another game you have saved on your hard drive.  How cool is that?  If only someone could make a Gauntlet game like this...   Through cutscenes and dialog, you find yourself becoming more steadily more involved in the mysterious happenings at Baldur's Gate.  I refrain from giving many details of the story, as it is best experienced first-hand.  What I will say is that the story is exceptional and intriguing, and well worth your time.  I was entranced with the story from the opening narration, with its well-written dialog, evoking music, and overall polish.  Great stuff.   The game is viewed primarily from a three-quarter top-down view, much like Diablo, or even the old Zelda games.  You move your character with the left analog stick, and you can rotate the camera with the right stick.  You will definitely do some camera adjustment in some of the dungeons to attain the best view of the action.  Some levels will not let you move the camera but these levels are laid out in a way that it never becomes a problem.     Play Baldur's Gate now!  Controls are easy learn and you'll find yourself killing off Displacer Beasts like a pro in no time at all.  Pressing the A button attacks, B casts magic, Y jumps, and X is a generic context-sensitive action button.  The black button blocks, the white button cycles between your onscreen maps, and back will bring up your inventory screen.  Get used to seeing this inventory screen, as you'll be viewing it very often.  The screen is divided into six tabs which you can flip through.  There are sections for your weapons, armor, items, character stats, quest info, and leveling up.  On the right half of the screen there is a model of your character visually represented with all the items you have equipped him/her with.  You can find yourself entertained just by playing dress-up with your character since the changes are shown in real-time.  You can even strip your character down and have them battling Bugbears in their underwear, not that I would do such a thing...   Managing your inventory  will become very important, especially later on in the game.  Every weapon, armor, and item is assigned a specific weight, and you character has a set amount of weight he/she can carry.  Having better armor provides you with more protection, but also limits the potions you can carry because it is heavier.  If you find a new weapon but are up to capacity in carrying weight, you'll have to weigh out the importance of each.  Do you take the weapon and leave behind other precious items, or do you leave it, hoping to buy it later on from the store.  Knowing what to keep, sell, and pick-up becomes a large part of your game strategy.   In between you health and mana bars is your experience bar.  As you kill enemies and gain experience, the bar will fill.  Once full, you are given a set number of points with which you can increase your stats and magic.  What you decide to use the points on is up to you, but points are limited so you must choose wisely.     In normal battle, you can equip one melee weapon, and one ranged weapon at once, switching between the two using the directional pad.  Your ranged weapon (typically a bow) can be difficult to use accurately.  Even when you think you are perfectly lined up with an enemy, you'll find yourself missing your mark.  Luckily, one of the things you can spend your experience points on is a targeting line, which helps considerably.  Melee fighting on the other hand is much more useful, but not any less challenging.  Learning how to block, dodge, and lure your enemies will become crucial in your survival.  If you just go into every battle guns blazing, prepare to die.  And die.  And die.     To got through all the details of the game here would be a test of your patience, so I'll save you the trouble.  Also, it's best to find out the little nuances of the game by discovering them yourself.  While not nearly as deep as a true RPG, there is definitely more depth here than in a straightforward action game.  Yes, the quest is fairly linear, but its also a lengthy, engaging game that will surely eat up your days.     Graphics  For a PS2 port of a game that's almost a year old, Baldurs Gate: Dark Alliance still looks specious.  The worlds and characters are modeled so well, they almost come off as pre-rendered when in the standard overhead view.  There are no visible polygon edges or aliasing problems anywhere.  The only time you do see anything of that sort is when you're talking to someone directly and there is a close-up of the character, though even then the characters are attractive and they move just as fluidly.  Get ready for some first-class lip-syncing too.           A lot of the graphical splendor is in the details you might not even take into consideration.  I love how your character actually looks different depending on the weapons and armor you have equipped.  You can literally tell when you are wearing a different type of hat or have gloves on.  The detail is that good.  The animation of the monsters, especially when dying, is equally as impressive.  Watching spiders curl their legs in and die in a cloud of steam, or seeing the undead struggle for one last attack right before their last breath, or attacking a Beholder and causing its body to steadily become covered in blood is just awesome.  The best part is that almost every enemy in the game animates with this level of quality.  There are so many other little details it would take forever to name them all, but rest assured, you will not be disappointed.          The lighting is the game is also worthy of praise.  Every light source in the game glows with an eerie realism that makes you wish you had a Morning Star of Disruption to light your way home every night.  Your character, the monsters, and the environments all react just as you would imagine they would to different light sources, and even after you've seen them numerous times, it's hard to not be fascinated with it.  Even saving your game produces a nifty particle/lighting effect that's fun to watch.      So all this detail must come at a price, right?  Well, no.  The game's 60 fps never falters even at the busiest of times.  Fending off ten giant spiders while running around a pool of mercury water, while simultaneously rotating the camera around the detailed environments runs just as smoothly as sitting in an empty sewer.  It doesn't get better than this.   There really is little to complain about visually.  Ok, there are no real-time reflections on the water or every surface, and killing enemies in water looks a little strange as the blood textures seem to levitate over the water.  There are also a few very minor clipping issues (I mean MINOR), and the game doesn't really use any Xbox-specific effects, but really, you'll be so immersed in the game to really even think about volumetric grass and bump-mapped armor.  It would be nice though...     Magic hula-hoop of the undead  Sound  The  most prevalent sounds you will hear in Baldur's Gate are human voices and the clang of your weapon(s).  Every major character you speak to is fully voiced, and the results are excellent.  They sound honest and believable, with just the right amount of acting and emphasis.  This is only accented by the elegant hand gestures they make while speaking.  No one's going to win an Oscar here, but the voice-acting is definitely in the upper-echelon of game's with spoken dialog.     The background score is very minimal.  When there is music, it is absolutely heavenly.  The song played the first time you are in the Elfsong tavern is simply sublime.  When there is no music, there are environmental and atmospheric sounds.  These are equally as impressive, and create a delightful sense of space.  Walking around town hearing all the city chatter does a great job of creating the illusion of daily city hustle.  The town music is also one of my favorite pieces, with its uplifting and serene quality.  Oddly enough, the first few bars remind me of Angelo Badalamenti's Twin Peaks theme song, another favorite of mine.      Just as impressive as the music are the sound effects.  You can feel the power behind the thwip of the bow string and the swing of your scimitar.  The thud of breaking barrels is also strangely satisfying.  Enemies grunt and hiss, flames crackle and roar, and saving your game produces a pleasant swooshing effect.     Some gamers may want more thematic music during play time, but I found the minimalist approach quite effective.  The foreboding ambience in the Crypts was easily as competent at tone setting as is a finely composed score.  Heck, even the moments of silence set me in the mood.  If you don't know what I mean, go watch 1960's Psycho.  Oh, and on a side note, if you wait for the music to stop playing on the title screen, the nighttime sounds of the insects and creek make for a relaxing work environment.  Forget that 200 dollar nature sounds clock you bought at Brookstone and go buy Baldur's Gate!Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance is a fantastic game.  There is a sense of overall refinement and polish that makes it hard not to like anything about it.  It looks and sounds excellent, and plays even better.  A true gem.  What hurts this game's score is the fact that it is almost exactly the same game that was released last year, not that that's a bad thing.  The game is a fine example of exceptional game-making.  But an extra level or character, or really any added extras would've been great.  But, like the old saying goes, if it aint broke, don't fix it.  If you've never played the PS2 version, I couldn't recommend this game enough.  It's a rich, artistic game, full of nuance.  For those of you who already own the PS2 version, dust off the cover and play it again.  NOW.", "date": "Oct 18, 2002"}
