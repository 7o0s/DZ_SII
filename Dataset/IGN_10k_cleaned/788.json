They've successfully combined sim-style options and arcade action into one game. They also put Mitch Richmond on the cover, so it has to be good. The show time begins with an action-packed intro full of no-look passes and dunks galore. After regaining consciousness, select from three levels of challenge: rookie, starter, or all-star. Not to mention all the NBA teams, complete with players, stats, and logos. And with custom play styles and multiple game modes, this game has got game. There are so many improvements from last year's rendition, it's not even funny. New and improved camera angles, create and edit player options, more dunks, more dunks, more dunks, better sound and music and my favorite: shiny courts. On top of all that -- they got Shaq Fu, I mean Shaq too. Yeah, I don't like him either, but he scores a lot of points. Not only did EA focus on options, it also took the time to make the game look nice. The beautifully texture-mapped polygonal players run at a smooth frame rate making the game fast and fun. I especially love the replays. Seeing Shawn Kemp dunk on Dennis Rodman is always a good thing; seeing it twice is even better. EA has definitely poured its love of the game into this one. From shooting alley-oops to Patrick Ewing, to the commentary of announcer Ernie Johnson Jr., this game has it all. I can't wait for '98.  Jay Boor", "date": "Mar 22, 1997"}
