Looking forward to the possibilities and potentials of the Virtual Console a year ago, a truth was made clear. Digital downloads, of classic games, at standardized prices, would mean value discrepancies. Some games would simply offer you more for your money  that's always been true of video games, of course, but it's made clearer here. Here where you can spend 500 Points on something like Urban Champion, offering you, at most, minutes worth of play, or the same 500 on an hours-long adventure like The Legend of Zelda. Looking forward a year ago, it was clear that the best value would come with one as-yet-unrepresented genre  RPGs. Role-playing games offer the most hours of gameplay, the deepest storylines, the most engaging quests. RPGs on the VC would offer the best value for your Points, and now the genre is, at last, represented. It's about time.   300 hours worth of time. So claimed early magazine ads for this first RPG to arrive on the Virtual Console, Sword of Vermilion. Sword comes from Sega, a first-wave title that arrived on the Genesis during the early ~Genesis does what Nintendon't~ ad campaign. The game was held up as a flagship title  a colorful, full-featured game experience offering much more than anything you could find available on Nintendo's competing hardware. The claim was partially true. It was true in that Sword of Vermilion did offer some advancements over Nintendo's 8-bit titles of the day, in the area of graphics and sound design. But the gameplay's the thing, and Sword's is not so compelling.    You're cast as the son of a murdered king, tasked with avenging your father's death and reclaiming the throne from the tyrant Tsarkon. Bringing him down means questing for eight rings of power, each one hidden away in a cave, near a town, full of villagers. Sword of Vermilion is a highly repetitive game. You do the normal RPG thing in NPC-populated villages, talking to people, buying new weapons and items, sleeping at the inn and saving your progress in the church. Then you leave town, the perspective shifts to an overworld view, and you search for a dungeon to enter.   Along the way, you'll run into random battles. There the perspective changes again. And when you fight a boss character, you're in for viewpoint No. 4. This game is a patchwork quilt of different play perspectives  in villages, it's the normal, birds-eye view of typical RPGs. Exploring the overworld and dungeons switches it to a first-person view, though, like early D&D games or a linear take on Doom.    The battle view, you'd think, would stay in that first-person focus  but you'd think wrong. Rather than turn-based, head-on combat like the Dragon Quest games, Sword leaps into dynamic, action-RPG fight scenes where you get direct control over the hero and can run, dodge and attack enemies within the confines of a single screen field. The boss fights totally remix it again, changing to a viewpoint like a side-scrolling platformer. Only you can't jump.   With all the shifting, moving and jumping around from one view to another, your instinct may be that Sword of Vermilion keeps its gameplay feeling fresh for hours on end. But not so much. The novelty inspired by the transitions quickly subsides, as each of the four gameplay styles is restricted in its own way. The random battles in particular feel like a chore  your character is not very capable with his weapon, and you may find yourself just wanting to run away from fights rather than hack away at your enemies with your striking blade of five-pixel range.   And the 300 hours of gameplay promised by the ~Nintendon't~ ads don't all appear  though Sword is of a fair length, even 10% of that total time would be pushing it.    No, unfortunately, it seems the trumpeting fanfare heralding the Virtual Console's first true RPG is a bit undeserved. Sword of Vermilion does qualify as a game that offers a lot of time value for your dollars  800 Points for 20-25 hours sounds like a pretty swank deal. But it doesn't qualify with play value. There's a long quest, yes, but it achieves its length through repetition and formulaic progression from town to town. Better, richer RPGs will come to the VC in the future. Save your money for them.", "date": "Mar 5, 2007"}
