This series takes the sport of boxing back to the old days of over-the-top fighters and animations spawned by Nintendo's own Mike Tyson's Punch-Out for the NES. Forget about Ali and Foreman, this new crew of fighters features the Chris Rock stylings of ~Afro Thunder~ and the Dolph Lundgren slurs of ~Boris Knokimov~ in a presentation that is sure to get you laughing and ready to come out swinging.  The original version was released on just about every major videogame system known to man back in 1999, and given its popularity (and the clever ability to simply add ~Round Two~ to the title), a sequel was sure to follow. Due to the obvious technical reasons, there's certainly no doubt that the Dreamcast (and now PlayStation 2) versions are by far the ones to own if possible. But N64 gamers without such options are no doubt curious if this latest upgrade packs any new elements of fun, or perhaps if it has lost that magic touch. Well, let's not throw in the towel just yet -- read on to get IGN64's full ringside report.  The Facts  For one or two players simultaneously Four modes of play: Arcade, Championship, Tournament, and Team Battle Up to eight players can compete alternately in the new Tournament Mode Familiar lineup of returning boxers, plus many new hidden boxers such as Shaquille O'Neal, Michael Jackson, and Hillary and Bill Clinton. New special moves, combos, and three levels of ~rumble flurries~ with a ~Knock Out of the Ring Punch~ New player taunts, introductions, and victory dances Improved single-player AI Save game data via Controller Pak Rumble Pak support  Gameplay It's like mama used to say: ~If it ain't broke, don't go and try to make it all better 'cause you might just end up screwing it up and nobody wants that now do they?~ Mama didn't exactly get out much, but you get the idea. And Midway apparently already knew this old adage, because the same enjoyable arcade-boxing mechanics of the original Ready 2 Rumble have returned to the sequel virtually unchanged and as fun as the first time. To start, players must select their desired mode of play from the four available choices. Single-player gamers looking to jump right into the standard fighting routine will head straight for the Arcade Mode. Or, if you're looking for a more in-depth R2R experience, then you can opt for the Championship Mode, where players can train their characters to build strength in many different areas and then pursue their dreams through a calendar schedule of prizefights. Both options are equally fun for either a quick fighting fix or a longer, more strategic bout of career boxing action. And of course, both feature the same classic Ready 2 Rumble gameplay found in the first title as well. Strangely, the promised addition of a Practice Mode is nowhere to be found in the final version of the game, so players will have to learn the ropes the good old-fashioned way by jumping straight into the action.  Each selectable character features defining attributes such as age, weight, height, and reach, and your ability to pound your challenger will indeed depend on some of these factors. But when it comes time to select your fighter, usually such considerations are secondary to simply finding the boxer that sports your favorite attitude and flair. Each boxer features unique voices and personality-packed animations that manage to comprise half the fun of the game alone. Many of the original characters from the first game have returned for the sequel, including the series mascot Afro Thunder. In addition, Midway has gone the extra mile to include many new and hidden characters that should spice up the character choices. Seeing the ~First Lady~ (as denoted in the game for obvious legal reasons) bounce around the ring in a long gray skirt and white sneakers is just too funny to pass up. And it's even funnier to see her face completely swollen and bruised at the end of the match, as all players feature somewhat realistic facial damage during the course of gameplay.  Once you enter the ring, players can throw four types of punches using the C buttons: high and low, right and left. Each punch can be altered a bit based on the direction held by the analog stick, thus making for a good variety of uppercuts and jabs to unleash on your victims. Like the first game, the animations for such attacks are all very satisfying to watch but can be a bit too sluggish at times. The game is still very playable, but fans of other quicker fighting games will notice that there is an ever so slight delay between each press of the button and the actual punch being thrown. Because of this, the game becomes very hard to play with any real strategy or tactics and instead resorts to your ability to simply out button-mash your opponent. The A and B buttons can be used for high and low blocking, but again your inability to react and time such defensive maneuvers will mean that you rarely reach for such buttons and instead keep pounding on the punches. The only real strategy involved is deciding when to use your earned powered-up mode of  ~rumble flurries.~ The good news is that the frantic button-mashing found in Ready 2 Rumble: Round 2 is still fairly enjoyable despite the lack of any real strategic boxing elements, but in the end it really hurts the replayability of the title. The game will be shelved much sooner because of this simple and toned-down gameplay once such thrills have eventually lost their initial excitement.  Multiplayer If there's one hope for keeping this title in your N64, multiplayer action would definitely be it. The remaining two modes of play will allow anywhere from two to eight players to furiously pummel each other in the ring -- something that can be fairly entertaining at parties due to the shallow learning curve of the title. The Tournament Mode will create a standard elimination bracket for up to eight fighters to compete for the ultimate prize in a series of head-to-head two-player matches. And the Team Battle pits two players in a survival match, each selecting a number of fighters to compete in a series of rounds -- the player loosing the least fighters being crowned victorious at the end. Again, despite the watered-down gameplay of the title, there are some fun and humorous moments to be enjoyed in the multiplayer modes, and this will eventually be the only reason to come back to the game.  Graphics Once again, the visuals in this Midway rumbler are about the most that anyone could really ask of the N64 at this point in time. But having said that, there's just no way this version is even in the same league as the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 versions of the software. Everything here has been stripped and streamlined to meet the constraints of Nintendo's cart based system, and given these limitations the title looks to be above average. The player models are all actually very well done, with skin that appears to bulge and stretch rather impressively at times. In fact, everything inside the ring itself looks rather nice, but once you get beyond that, there's really not much to see. The crowd consists of one simple, static, bland row of sprites on each side of the ring -- that's it. Beyond that is the dark, black void of space until you get to the far reaches of the room where a few more blurry textures have been planted for a stadium feel. The presentation really suffers because of this lack of visuals, but considering that the framerate is already on the borderline of playability, their omission is probably all for the better.  Sound Like the graphical department, the audio elements in Ready 2 Rumble: Round 2 are also a mixed bag. Some components are actually quite nice, such as the great use of voice throughout the game. Each character really comes to life with several elements of speech for different circumstances both before, during, and after gameplay. Most of these voiceovers are even new to this version of the game, so fans of the series will have fresh ear candy to savor. The same great Michael Buffer, ~Let's get ready to rumble,~ intro will accompany every match you enter, but again it's all very toned down in comparison to the great renditions found on other systems. The crowd is weak, the music is much less crisp, and the punches are a bit softer. Overall, a respectable treatment once again for the N64, but it leaves much to be desired. If no other systems or choices were present, the N64 version of Ready to Rumble: Round 2 would make a great addition to any gamer's library. The game takes the already tried and true formula of fast and carefree arcade boxing and adds new characters, new animations, new voices, and new multiplayer modes. If you already own the first title and have since lost interest, then this sequel is definitely not enough to entice you for another purchase. If you are a true fan of the series, then perhaps give it a good weekend rent before you remember why you ended up putting the game down in the first place.But for those who are new to the franchise, lacking any other next-generation systems, and interested in a fun dose of wacky personality-packed boxing, then consider this sequel to be even better than the original and worth checking out. If anything, you'll enjoy beating the tar out of your friends repeatedly and watching your character shuck, jive, dance, and taunt his way across the screen over and over again.", "date": "Nov 29, 2000"}
