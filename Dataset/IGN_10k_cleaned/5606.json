IGN Wireless just downloaded the new Home Run King 2 on a shiny new LG VX8000 to put the slugger contest through the paces. Two questions arose while watching the game download: Is this an incremental follow-up to the first effort? Or did developer Lavastorm Entertainment go back to home plate to try something a little different?   After a few minutes with the game, it's obvious that it's the former. Home Run King 2 is a very simple batting contest, albeit one with clever little hooks that will keep you playing long after you may have normally stopped.   At the onset of Home Run King 2, you choose between two sluggers -- either a beefed-up old-tymer or a shaven skill swinger. They have slightly different stats, focusing on power or finesse, but the end result is pretty much the same. Zero in on their ~sweet spot~ and you can jam one out of the park every time.   Home Run King 2 is set up like a basic home run contest. You have an unlimited number of pitches and ten strikes means you're strikes. Strikes happen when you either whiff the ball or it drops down into the field.   The charm of the game is the stadium. Lavastorm has surrounded this diamond with some goofy real estate and airborne targets that all react to being hit by a ball. Nail one of the skyscraper and you hear shattering plate glass. Drop one into the parking structure and you hear the dent on a hood. Send one into the bleachers and a small animation pops up that shows the ball slamming some poor sap on the melon. Smash the giant hot dog sign that cover the frank with mustard. And these are just the beginning. There are hot air balloons and UFOs to hit, more billboards and signage to smash -- and this is what will likely keep you playing.   Home Run King 2 is a very clean little game with nice player models. The fully realized stadium and its zany surroundings, though, are the star. It looks great with lots of color. The sound effects are nice, too, including a few voice samples.  There are far too many simplified sports games on cellphones right now, from three-point contests to batting practices. However, if you are in the mood for just a simple home run contest -- a minor game you can jam on for a few minutes between meetings -- then Home Run King 2 may fit the bill. It's a shallow as they come, though, so buy on subscription if possible. There's not much chance this game will last for more than a month on your handset.", "date": "Mar 20, 2005"}
