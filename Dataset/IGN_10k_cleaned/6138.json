I've never seen the show nor played the card game, and the bits of research that I've done really only leaves me with the same background story that I've taken from the game, which is rather confusing for an outsider.   Here's what I think I've figured out: Zatch Bell is a mamodo, sent from the mamodo world in order to do battle to decide the next king. Zatch, who looks like a puppet or doll of some sort, wishes to become the ~Kind King~, as he puts in, and bring peace to whatever cracked out dimension he's trying to rule. There are a whole slew of other mamodo, some good, some bad, vying for the same position as Ruler of Randomville (my own words), including a puppet horse, fur-covered purple guy and some sort of disastrous duck creature that looks like one of Dr. Mephisto's experiments gone horribly wrong.    At its most basic level, Zatch Bell is a button masher of a fighting game. You have access to a rather limited number of melee attacks, which for most of the child-like characters means an assortment slaps, knees to the groin, arm flails and other schoolyard moves. On top of this are a series of spells available to each character, which is actually controlled by the mamodo's partner who wields some sort of satanic bible with which to conjure things like giant hearts with wings. Makes perfect sense to me.   Like I said, The Mamodo Battles is the poster child for button masher fighting games. Essentially, all of your melee attacks are done with the X button, which doesn't leave a whole lot of room for mixing up your moves. Your satanic keeper can conjure crazy spells through your character's bastardly mortal shell, but these are as simple as a press of the square button and maybe a direction or two. Mix in a simple block and a somewhat useless counter button and you have one hell of a simplistic control scheme, which really doesn't allow for much depth.   The controls are rather responsive, but again, there's not much to them. Being as the game is 3D it allows you to move side-to-side, but most all of the spell attacks seem to be laser guided, so you can't really avoid them by side-stepping. You also can't jump, making anything but forward-backward movement somewhat nonsensical.    The fights are strung together via a series of story elements, which are unique to the character you're using to play through the game. Zatch aims to be the Kind King, Tia wants to shoot some sort of music video that somehow requires fighting as preparation... It's all here. As entirely random and crazy as the stories may be, they do a pretty decent job of explaining why two people are fighting, or at least as good of a job as you could do given the universe and totally ludicrous situations to why these people would be fighting in the first place.   As something of a hub between fights, you're able to choose from a number of areas to search or explore for the next fight. At best though, this is little more than a multiple choice selection screen as you really only see a changed background that reflects where you've gone. At worst, it's an excuse to eat up gameplay time because you're constantly searching for people to fight, and if you travel to an empty area (which you have no clues telling you so) then you have to wait while it loads the area, tells you there's nobody there, and then loads the selection screen again. It's nice that the game gives you some sort of options here, but really it's something of a waste of time since you just have to hunt out the next character the game wants you to fight. And even given the times where you're able to pick more than one fight - which you have no idea whether you do or not - you still have no idea which characters are available, so it's really not any sort of ~choice~ at all, but a random lottery drawing of sorts.Zatch Bell!: The Mamodo Battles is a shallow fighting game with, we'd assume, the proper quirks of an extremely odd kids' television show. The setting, story and universe that these characters are part of are entirely ludicrous, though that's a bit of its charm. The fighting aspects of the game are only somewhat passable, so fans of the series - especially young kids - may find joy in this title, but anyone who's used to the depth, variety or challenge of Soulcalibur, Tekken, Virtua Fighter or anything else of that caliber should steer clear.", "date": "Oct 11, 2005"}
