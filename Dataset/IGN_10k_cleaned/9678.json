The original Air Zonk was a side-scrolling shooter for the TurboGrafx-16, a spin-off of the Bonk franchise and an all-around impressive experience for the platform. And it made sense that when the Turbo system got an upgrade to CD media, that new disc-based hardware was graced by a sequel to Air Zonk's debut adventure. What's nonsensical, though, is that while Super Air Zonk is home to a predictable upgrade in its soundtrack thanks to the new CD format it was developed for, its visuals actually got a comparative downgrade. It's not as super as you'd expect.   SandroVitch is the name of the big bad boss this time around  an ugly, schmush-faced alien who's declared himself the emperor of Earth and demands its citizens pay him tribute. But Air Zonk isn't having that, especially after Sandro's minions kidnap the Z Man's many friends and fellow members of Team Cool. He jets off in pursuit of the villains, determined to rescue his pals along the way.   That's a change from the previous Zonk game, as before you'd be able to pick and choose your in-flight partner ahead of time. Now you'll have to rescue your friends one at a time, in the middle of the action stages, to be able to join forces with them. It's a shift in design direction, and one that also effects Zonk's firepower  saving each stage's partner character activates a combined ~fusion form~ and increased offensive capabilities for the remainder of the level. Miss him or her, though, and you'll be out of luck all the way through the next boss fight.   Zonk's back for more side-scrolling and shooting.  Those are fairly interesting, if not altogether original-feeling after playing through the first Air Zonk. But bosses provide this adventure's most compelling visual moments, since each stage's background displays have been downgraded this time.   That's the visual letdown mentioned before. Whereas the first Air Zonk offered layered, fast-scrolling parallax backgrounds, Super Air Zonk has none. The stages here seem dull and lifeless in comparison, and there's no room for any aspect of the experience to be called lifeless when you're playing a side-scrolling shooter. The genre demands constant action and movement to stay engaging, and that's something that Super Air Zonk just doesn't have all the time.   Thankfully, Super Air Zonk's soundtrack counterbalances some of the loss in graphics with a much more diverse and interesting musical style. The game's subtitle is Rockabilly Paradise, and that's certainly what you'll experience  a wacked-out arrangement of guitar and keyboard sound mashed together and presented through CD-quality audio. Some of it's fast-paced, some of it's slow. A Sound Test option on the main menu lets you sample it all right away.The library of Virtual Console shooters continues to expand, now to the point where I believe it's impossible to have them all downloaded onto your Wii Channel Array at the same time. That means action-loving gamers will have to pick and choose the best of the best, and in making that decision it'd be odd to see anyone choose Super Air Zonk over its own prequel. The original Air Zonk is 200 Wii Points cheaper than this follow-up, and feels more dynamic and fun overall. Super Air Zonk is still a good game, and its soundtrack is certainly worth a listen. But it's just not a game that should really be called ~super.~", "date": "Dec 4, 2007"}
