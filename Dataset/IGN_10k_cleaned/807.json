Given LucasArt's poor showing with their last foray into the realm of strategy gaming, Rebellion, many were wary at what LucasArts had planned next for their beloved Star Wars universe. We waited and waited and waited. And then last year LucasArts told us all that the Force Commander project would be delayed to update the previous 2D engine to an all-new completely 3D engine. So we waited and waited and waited some more. ~That's okay, LucasArts,~ we all said. ~We'll wait for another year as long as you give us a top-notch 3D Star Wars RTS.~ Unfortunately, that day never came...   ~Oh my god! Say it isn't so! Hot water burn baby, hot water burn baby!~ This rather odd string of phrases was what my office mates witnessed when I loaded up Force Commander this week and started playing the first mission. ~What has happened to my once beautiful Star Wars?,~ I asked, dismayed at the bland, dappled scene in front of me. In an odd twist of fate, Force Commander actually suffers from its use of a 3D engine. What could have been a great feature to enhance the way we play RTS games turned out to be Force Commander's biggest undoing. It makes the game much more tedious to play than it should be, and it's just plain ugly. Sure, the 3D terrain does offer some strategic value, but you wouldn't know it from the computer AI as units will continue to fire into the ground continuously if an opposing unit is below them without ever moving to an acceptable firing spot. They won't even move to the edge of a ledge and use the terrain to their advantage...and this is just the beginning of what's wrong with LucasArt's foray into the 3D RTS realm.   Now I know the old adage, ~Good graphics don't make the game.~ But I also know that bad graphics can ruin one. This isn't necessarily the case with Force Commander, as there are plenty of other things that mar the gameplay experience, but the visuals certainly play a big part in its downfall. From the very start of the game the graphics are blotchy, blurry, and blocky (Well, not actually the very start. The game begins with a rather nice rendered scene of a AT-ST running away from some rebel tanks in a deep, dark canyon, but this only lasts for about five seconds...then things fall apart). The explosions are weak, the animation is stiff, and there's nary a shadow in the game save the solid black patches in the pitiful cutscene briefings.   Although you'll recognize many of the settings in Force Commander from the Star Wars movies, all of the landscapes are washed-out, bland, and lifeless. This turns once vibrant locales such as Yavin IV and Endor into little more than mottled sheets of green, gray, and brown stretched over a blocky 3D skeleton. The poor unit models don't do much to help the visual end of Force Commander, either. If you zoom in to get a good look at your units you can almost count the polygons that comprise each. And all of the polygons in the Stormtrooper models don't even fit together properly, making the once ominous Troopers resemble laughable floating suits of armor.   All of this is made even worse by the fact that the blue boxes that surround your units are incredibly distracting and make it impossible to discern your troops from a distance. Why the design team decided to surround each of the units with a glowing box when a flat colored circle at each unit's feet would have sufficed is beyond me. The rigid unit animation is even worse as your troops skim and skate above the surface of the terrain, not synchronizing with the movement of their legs at all. Of course, none of this really matters anyway since usually you'll have the view zoomed out so far in an attempt to control all 60 of your units in real time that all you see is a bunch of blue boxes shooting at beige blobs.   Speaking of the view, at first I was pretty impressed with how easy it was to move the camera around the 3D battlefield. But after encountering numerous camera positioning and clipping problems where my view was stuck behind part of the landscape, I gave up on even trying to rotate the camera, instead fixing my view in one position and simply moving the camera left, right, forward, and backward.   The interface in Force Commander is one of the worst I've seen in a long time. Not only does it take up a third of the bottom of your screen, relegating the battlefield to an elongated top portion of your formerly extensive monitor but, like the rest of the game, it's just plain ugly to boot. It's blocky, it's jagged, and all of the text in the interface is presented in huge, chunky fonts that looks like something out of my Apple II days circa 1984. As if this wasn't bad enough, the icons for your individual selected units are so blurry that they actually induced headaches in a few of the weaker members of the IGN compound. The interface can be removed altogether, but you lose much of the functionality of the game without it, so it's even more problematic to play the game full screen than it is to squint and bear it.   Sure, it's ugly, hard to control, and the AIs not all that great, but at least it runs well, right? No such luck. Although the minimum specs are a P266, Force Commander is a system hog, and you'll notice framedrop and slowdown on all but the most robust of computer systems. I played Force Commander on a Celeron 300, a PII450, and a PIII600. It was unplayable on the 300, choppy on the 450, and I still experienced occasional hops and jumps on the 600 when a huge battle was unfolding.   Shall I go on with the disappointment that is Force Commander? Yes, I shall. Whoever thought it was a good idea to whip up a techno remix of the Imperial March should be relegated to working in the LucasArts mail room. Obviously someone thought John Williams didn't quite get it right the first time around, so they added a heavy beat and some ~wacky~ laser sounds to the once ominous fugue. Now I almost expect the Stormtroopers to bust out the ecstasy, stick pacifiers in their mouths, and start shooting their lasers in the air to watch the pretty colors dancing in the atmosphere. Thankfully the music is pretty low key when you're actually playing a mission, but the sound mix in Force Commander is all out of whack, with the sound effects overpowering some very important voiceovers that are critical to the game. And you can't adjust the mix in the game even if you wanted to. Sheesh!   As if the unbalanced sound mix, blurry graphics, and poor game mechanics weren't enough to ruin this latest Star Wars title, it's also awash with several bugs, the most obvious of these being the random crashes and video problems that I experienced on all of the 3dfx-based systems I played the game on. The most annoying graphical glitch I ran into was one where the menus would turn into thick solid lines, making it a pick and choose process to perform such requisite tasks as load, save, or read the mission objectives. It wasn't so bad once you knew exactly where each option was, but this seems like a bug that should have been caught by QA considering that 3dfx-based boards are still the best selling graphics accelerators on the market.   Force Commander allows you to play with up to three others in multiplay games, but unless you have the luxury of a LAN or want to simply challenge a friend over a modem you have to go through the convoluted MS Gaming Zone to find an opponent. There were about 100 people playing Force Commander the last time I was on The Zone making it easy to find a challenger, but when I first arrived in the challenge room I got a message that Force Commander wasn't installed. After making my way through about a dozen more windows and downloading the 4.3MB v1.1 patch that overwrites your mid-mission save games, I was finally able to play a few rounds, and I wasn't impressed.  Being on a broadband connection, lag wasn't much of a problem, but the game still ran slow and I never really liked the single-player game that much, so multiplay wasn't that exciting.  I did like a few things about the game.  I thought the command point system of resource management fit in well with the Star Wars universe since all of the land battles started quickly in the movies.  Instead of mining and refining resources to build your troops, you gain command points for completing tasks such as capturing enemy installations and turning opposing forces into space ash.  And, of course, it was really neat being able to play some of the scenes from the Star Wars saga.  You start off as the Imperial forces looking for R2-D2 and C-3PO on Tatooine and eventually work your way to Yavin IV, Hoth, Endor, and eventually to Coruscant.  I also like the progression of the game from controlling the Imperial side in the beginning to eventually joining on with the Rebel forces.  Actually, most of the concepts and ideas behind the game were great, it's just the implementation that left a lot to be desired.  I never thought I'd say this, but I hates me some Star Wars, at least as long as Force Commander is the current representative.  I'm a huge Star Wars fan and I really wanted to like Force Commander (some folks around the office even think I'm going a bit easy on big, bad, and blurry), but even I can't stand to play this one anymore.  I doubt you'll like Force Commander even if you have to own everything Star Wars -- as a matter of fact it might just piss you off more to play such a bad game set in the Star Wars universe.  There's a lesson to be learned here: if you're going to go 3D, then don't do it just for 3Ds sake.  Make it functional and make it look good.  There are just so many great 3D RTS games on the verge of release like Ground Control, Earth 2150, and Dark Reign 2 that utilize a 3D landscape properly and look beautiful to boot, so you might as well just wait for them.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Mar 25, 2000"}
