Evidence: The Last Ritual picks up where Missing left off.   The Phoenix is still at large and still up to his old tricks, leading investigators on a wild goose chase, as more bodies are uncovered and more people kidnapped.  It's a fun experience that plays exactly like the first, with a couple minor improvements.  It doesn't bring anything completely new to the table, but that doesn't mean it doesn't deliver.   The sequel plays out much like the original, with 'chapters' that have 'pages' that need to be solved.  Every time a puzzle is solved, the Phoenix reveals another clue in the form of a movie, either from Jack Lorski's (who many who played the first game will be very familiar with) documentary in his pursuit of the Phoenix or a pair of women, Jessica and Sharon, as they search for a long lost brother named Adrian.  This isn't all the help the player has to help them along on these usually vague and complex puzzles, though.  Kristin and a crack team of specialists often send emails with clues and things they've 'discovered'.  Players can also create a network for themselves through the website, with others who are playing the game at the same time.   She's a little bound. The puzzles themselves range from easy and obvious to obscure and impossible, even with clues.  Solving them involves a variety of tactics, from searching the web (and players would be well advised to use the built in search function on the special website provided) to using tools provided in game to examine images.  Many involved inputting a name of some kind, which can be discovered by searching the web or by deciphering anagrams or codes.  Others use elements of sound.  For example, one such puzzle required putting together a sequence of sounds in the proper order.  Other puzzles are incredibly basic.  One required circling like letters without managing to get other letters stuck in the circle.  It's a good mix of hard and easy, but there are a couple puzzles that really stump, even with Kristin's clues.  These could be showstoppers for anyone unwilling to search outside message forums for help.   Creepiness pervades the entire atmosphere of the game and the graphics contribute to this on several levels with a mix of disturbing images and videos using real actors.  There's no real change from the first game on this front, but it definitely gets the job done.  The puzzles that make use of  a woman bound in various ways and tortured are really disturbing, but in a good way.  The sound and music is also appropriately disquieting and even though these are puzzles and documentary videos, not graphic animations, and the format is known, the whole package can sometimes make a person jump and their skin crawl.   Part of the documentary in the search for the brother. The packaging lacks any written manual, but the game does an adequate job of helping people along, through the emails and the intuitive controls.  There is a readme on the disk with all the necessary instructions, if someone is finding the basics a little hard to grasp, but that should rarely happen.  The website has a web search function and a translator.  There's also a notepad that players can use to jot down things they think are important.  The coolest part of the website, of course, is seeing the player's name flash across the top of the screen every time they advance through a puzzle.  There's just something about this form of tooting one's own horn that is really appealing.  There's also the opportunity for players to write articles about their experiences in the game that other player's can read.  The community aspect all comes together nicely.Overall, it's the same game with a continued story and some different puzzles.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the first title certainly left us wanting more.  It's been a long time between titles, though, so most people will have to refresh their memory heavily to understand the backstory.  It isn't absolutely necessary to have played the first game or even remember the details of it, especially since information about the first case is available on a website devoted to The Phoenix, but it certainly makes the whole package more entertaining.  For anyone who loved the first title, this one is an obvious pick-up.  For everyone else, if you love puzzles and creepy scenery, pick up both titles, it would be well worth the money.", "date": "Dec 4, 2006"}
