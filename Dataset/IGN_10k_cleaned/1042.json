After all, I've played some pretty great character-based water racing adventure games in my time, so for this one to so boldly pronounce itself ~ultimate~  that really means something.  If this all seems silly, then it properly sets the tone for a review of Renegade Racers. The premise behind the game is simple enough: Buck Billionaire has issued a challenge to all the world's top renegades to compete in a free-for-all racing adventure, then hand picked the top twelve. Included in the definition of renegade are the game's twelve very distinct characters: an army major, a cowboy, a rich snob, a gangster, a disco dancer, an undercover agent, a Jamaican machinist, a mad scientist, a hippy, a mummy, Frankenstein, and Buck himself.  Renegade Racers, as you can probably assume by now, is a water-based racing game, complete with hazards and an assortment of weapons and other goodies with which to assault other racers. In the one-player arcade version of Renegade Racers, you choose one of the first six characters  the rest are hidden  and play out a series of thirty-two races. As you go, the courses get harder, the opponents faster and craftier, and the games more fun. Aside from the standard first-to-finish, there are more than half a dozen other kinds of races in this mode. Check Point Challenge, Air Time, and Dodgems, to name a few. Sometimes, there are two race modes going at once, where, for example, you've got to finish ahead of your competitors and jump farther than them along the way. Every five or six races, you'll be challenged to a head-to-head race with a new character  the latter six from the list above  and if you beat them, you can begin using them in the game. Thirty-two races is a lot, and some of them are hard enough (even on easy difficulty) to require more than a few tries, so it's fortunate that there's are plenty of saved game slots. In addition to arcade mode, there's quick race mode, which allows for a one or two player race, and high score race mode, which basically allows the user to re-try completed races from arcade mode in an attempt to score better.  The concept and options are simple enough, and so is the game-play. There are six courses to race around, including Fairground Fun and Arctic Action. Races are typically two or three laps long, with oft-imposed time limits (in arcade mode) of about a minute per lap. The whole thing takes place on the water, and the ambience is out of a cartoon. A lot of emphasis is placed on the items found during the race. There are missiles with which to temporarily disable opponents, question marks with a random chance of shrinking competitors, mines for setting traps, shields to protect you from all of the above, and lightning for extra speed. Up to two items can be retained at a time, and picking up two of a given item increases its power: heat-seeking missiles, proximity mines, stealth shields, and, well, more extra speed.  At first glance and first play, Renegade Racers is unimpressive but unobtrusive. The play control is easy enough to learn and execute, whether with keyboard or joystick, and the rules of the game are anything but complicated. Largely this is where the game is weak. There's very little to learn about the game, and new players are up to speed in less time than you've yet spent reading this review. And once they are, there's very little to surprise or intrigue them later. Go around in a circle, do it again, then maybe a third time. Oh, and pick up missiles. That's about all there is to it. To top it off, the characters are cartoons, and for that matter, so is just about everything else in the game. There is little to differentiate between characters, despite what the instruction booklet may say about 'Good' versus 'Medium' or 'Fair' maneuverability.  Fortunately, though, there are perks. I walked into this review biased  I'd never really liked water racing games, whether on motorboats or water skis. This game, it appears, is an exception to my rule. Renegade Racers uses hover-boats as its chosen medium, and it works. The gameplay, repetitive as it is, is as smooth as it is realistic. There are currents in the water, and they affect your boat's progress  for better or for worse  as much as the barriers in your way. The boats also bounce as they go, which is kind of cool.  I first played quick race mode to get a feel for the game, but I couldn't get into it. I then tried the more elaborate arcade mode. I was pleasantly surprised, and it wasn't too long before I was hooked. The game is hard enough that it's a challenge and isn't wasting the user's time, but easy enough that every level is at least possible, even on the first try. I found myself desperately wanting to unlock all the secret characters, not to try them out  they're really not that different from each other -- but because they're increasingly difficult to defeat head-to-head and unlock, I relished the challenge.  At this point, I was very much so-so on the game, figuring that as much as my opinion of it had improved in the past two hours, it would all come to an end when I finished the last race. But I hadn't unlocked Renegade Racers' biggest asset yet: multi-player racing.  Normally, this isn't a blessing, but it's hard for one human player to play much better than another in this game. I learned this when I played against other real people, as I had been playing for hours and they were already up to my level. When one player is behind, the gameplay is geared toward getting that player ahead again, largely because that's the position from which one can shoot missiles, which significantly reduces the gap. Between the fun cartoon violence, the close calls, the short games, and the swift learning curve, Renegade Racers makes for one heck of an addictive super-competitive multi-player game.  And it's not such a bad single-player game, either.  -- Eric Benner", "date": "Jun 22, 2000"}
