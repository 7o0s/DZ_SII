Originally developed in the 1986 by Russian computer scientist Alexey Pajitnov, the Tetris franchise has seen in the area of 88 releases on 22 different systems, with more than 55 million units sold worldwide. That's quite a record coming from a game that is so simple in concept, yet so incredibly addictive.  Over the years a lot of different spins have been shoved into the basics of Tetris. However, variations like Weltris, Facetris, and Hatris failed to charm the world as much as the Tetris, and the same can be said about the recently released Tetris Worlds, which falls short at trying to one-up (or six-up in this case) the original.  This time around a story has been created for the game (for some odd unnecessary reason), but it's kind of a stretch. The premise behind Tetris Worlds is that a blocky race of Minos are searching for a new planet to populate as their sun is about to go supernova. They have made a call to their brethren to find the best Tetris players from around their home-planet of Hadar 4 to complete certain Tetris challenges that will open doorways to other planets. Like I said, it's kind of a stretch and it's pretty unnecessary. The story adds absolutely nothing to the game, and only serves as a reason to have six different backgrounds -- which are actually pretty bland -- for the playing field to rest upon.   In addition to the story-mode, Tetris Worlds also includes six arcade modes:   Tetris If you don't know what this mode is all about, you probably don't deserve to be playing videogames. This is classic Tetris. You manipulate falling game pieces comprised of four different blocks in various shapes (called Tetriminos) to form horizontal rows of blocks that are then cleared from the playfield. You must keep doing this before the blocks reach the top of the screen. Points are scored for clearing lines, and clearing simultaneous lines garners you more points. Clearing four lines at once, which is called a Tetris, rewards you the most bonus points.   Square Tetris This is pretty much the same as classic Tetris. You get the same falling Tetriminos and still get points for clearing horizontal lines. What's different here is that you are also awarded bonuses for creating 4x4 blocks out of the falling Tetriminos and lines cleared that contain these get an even larger bonus. Plus, a T-spin coupled with cleared lines will cause certain blocks to fall, which is called an Avalanche.   Cascade Tetris Once again, the basic objectives are the same as classic Tetris, but in this mode left over Tetriminos fall into cells below a cleared line. If these falling blocks clear lines that they fall into it's called a Cascade, and you are rewarded with bonus points.   Sticky Tetris In this play mode you goal is to dig through the blocks on screen and clear the bottom row of blocks. When a line is cleared, left over pieces will fall through the spaces, and when they fall next to a same color piece, they will stick together. When enough blocks stick together, ~Critical Mass~ is reached and the blocks are cleared. You win by clearing the bottom row of the screen.   Hot-Line Tetris The objective here is to clear specific pre-marked lines that are called Hot-Lines. There are six Hot-Lines and the higher up in the screen that the Hot-Line is, the more points you're rewarded for clearing it.   Fusion Tetris With Fusion Tetris, the objective is to connect falling blocks called Atom blocks to the red Fusion Block at the bottom of the screen that's hidden beneath the Garbage blocks. Clearing lines containing an Atom block causes a Cascade, and so on.    While some of these -- particularly Cascade and Sticky Tetris -- have their charms, like so many other variations of Tetris, they just don't live up to the original. This coupled with bland, utilitarian menus, low-res graphics, and a generic techno soundtrack which seems somewhat displaced as an accompaniment to Tetris make Tetris Worlds a game that's not really worth taking a look at unless you're the most die-hard of Tetris fans.  If this weren't enough, the developers went and changed one of the basic tenants of Tetris in this latest revision. Now instead of the blocks locking into place once they reach the bottom of the screen, you can continue to rotate them until you get to the desired position, and as long as you keep them moving, they won't lock into place. You can literally continue turning your blocks for hours if you want. What's worse is, in some cases, you can rotate your blocks right up the side of a valley and continue to move them on the horizontal plane, wedging them in where ever you can find space without having to worry about figuring out the best place for your Tetriminos in a hurry.  However, one of the biggest downfalls of Tetris Worlds is that the game actually ends. You can go through 15 levels of difficulty, and then you're done. Part of the addiction of Tetris has always been to go as far as you can, with the pieces falling faster and faster and faster. With a cap being added to the game, it takes much of the addictiveness of the concept away.  Tetris Worlds does add some new tricks to the mix, but the bottom line is, if you're looking for a good Tetris game, you can search through the bargain bin at your local software store and find a cheaper alternative than Tetris Worlds, or even download a shareware version of Tetris for free. Tetris Worlds isn't horrible, but it certainly doesn't shine over the original in any way.  -- Kip Merriweather      Want to share your opinions with the world? Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  or send some mail to IGNPC about this story.  I don't think I've ever been this unimpressed by a Tetris game in my entire life. I've been playing the game since it was conceived in the late 80s. I've seen how profound an influence it has had on modern puzzle game design. But, never, ever have I been so disappointed with Tetris. THQ's Tetris Worlds is below average and even for the discounted price, it's not worth the buy. The intended visual and aural ~improvements~ to the GameCube and Xbox versions were a waste of time. Instead the gameplay should have been totally reworked, especially the multiplayer mode. So, unless you're dying to just play Tetris -- any Tetris -- on your system, don't even bother with Tetris Worlds. The point is that there's nothing new and the peripheral elements such as art and music composition are dull to the point of being abominable.", "date": "Jan 10, 2002"}
