The step-overs and feints as most famously practiced by the two Ronnies (Ronaldo and Ronaldinho) never fail to evoke admiration from fans and they certainly suggest a more exotic game than the humble throw-in, frenzied clearance or desperate goal mouth fumbles that more readily mark out our national pastime. FIFA Street 3  a game with no throw-ins, no long balls, and certainly nothing as dull as the offside rule  isn't concerned with muddy knees and scoreless slogs, and instead offers a bulging sack of trickery with which to dazzle amongst sun-kissed backdrops and impossibly gorgeous locales. It's a little like taking charge of one of those pre-World Cup football commercials that are dripping with cash and ego. That wouldn't be such a bad thing, if it weren't for the fact FIFA Street 3 has about as much depth and lasting appeal as said advert.   Acrobatic and adept, Brazil's answer to Joe Cole features strongly.  FIFA Street 3 is the first Xbox 360 / PlayStation 3 outing for Electronic Art's urban take on the art of running around and chasing a ball  and it is admittedly a big leap forward for the series. Taking its visual cues from the likes of Team Fortress 2, it stars the cream of the current footballing crop, all presented through a distinctive cartoon filter. By and large this approach does wonders for the game's presentation  not only are the likes of Rooney and Ronaldo injected with an added dose of character, the look clearly distinguishes the game from more serious attempts to tackle the sport. And Peter Crouch's mutated attributes as a human beanstalk are faithfully ported over, lending him the air of a man liable to snap in two at the faintest breeze. The look extends to the arenas in which the action plays out  from a Mediterranean beach to a rooftop jaunt, the pitches are vibrant and in keeping with the upbeat tone of the game.    Likewise, the aural side of FIFA Street 3 impresses, and this is one of the few games to actually benefit from EA's insistence on pinning an urban backbeat to its titles. Bowel bothering bass lines and bright hip-hop samples further reinforce the impression of taking control of a multi-million pound advert and the music reacts to the onscreen action to good effect, with heavy filters applied when a shot is rifled off and the BPM dropping off in more dramatic moments. Play is punctuated by the enthusiastic shouts of team-mates as they commend and deride in equal measure, although unsurprisingly the vocabulary of the cast is limited and soon becomes repetitive.    The Mutant in full flight.   First impressions, then, are favourable, and the first couple of games produce their fair share of grins and giggles as the players bound off walls and manipulate the ball with all the majesty of Maradonna in his prime. At its heart a game of five-a-side, players have at their command the usual suite of short passes and crosses, though the emphasis is firmly on the trickier side of football. The right analogue stick is assigned to skill moves and a few deft flicks will unleash a torrent of step-overs and feints. Another button is used for hoisting the ball into the air, allowing players to indulge in bouts of keep-ups sure to infuriate the opposition, or simply hooking the ball in the air over the heads of defenders.      Stringing together successions of tricks contributes to the Gamebreaker bar, which when full can be activated to gift all players on the team superhuman abilities, and in most cases almost certain to result in the ball ending up in the back of the net. Sadly, the inevitability of a goal coming from a Gamebreaker-empowered team means that in competitive play the feature readily lives up to its name  and unfortunately, the Gamebreaker is as deep as the game goes. Within a mere handful of games it's possible to have seen all the tricks at hand and to have mastered the ability to bring the ball home, and rapidly the same game plays itself out again and again.   Most frustrating is the lack of any thought given to the defensive aspect of the game. Admittedly the game deals primarily in the flair of attacking play, but lose the ball and you'll find yourself with a maddening lack of options in your arsenal, with defense reduced to either a light lunge or an exaggerated low sweep - neither of which are likely to land you in possession of the ball.    At the least it's an upbeat take on the sport.  There's a mere pretence of depth evident in highlighting the different attributes of each player ingame - an icon over each spells out whether they are playmakers, defensive powerhouses or deft strikers. however, the enclosed nature of the playing field, combined with the jettisoning of any recognisable formations in five-a-side football, make this feature largely redundant.     At least there's a generous amount of options for those playing the game with a friend. Playground picks is a particularly sweet feature, with two players taking it in turns to select their squad from a line-up of 10 hopefuls  and it's always nice to see the look of grim despondency on Scott Carson's face as he's again left at the back of the queue. It's clear that most time will be spent with this game in competition with friends, though it's unlikely that the game will see much light of day before it's replaced by its more somber brethren in the disc drive.    Rooney's depiction is suitably bullish.  The solo mode, however, is truly lacklustre. With no career or character creation to speak of, single players are merely offered the option to attack a series of challenges, which in turn serve to unlock the full roster of teams. Requirements never get any more imaginative than 'score more goals!' or 'score five headers or volleys!', and as such the mode quickly becomes a laboured limp through the game.   At first look theres so much to like about FIFA Street 3  its visual style is strong and charismatic, and the flamboyant legion of tricks and fakes make for an arresting looking game of football. Its such a shame, then, that the sheen is not backed up with any substance, as though the game enthralls in short bursts its hard to see anyone sticking with it for more than a couple of plays before moving on to more substantial fare  and as such we wouldnt recommend anyone paying out for the full-fat asking price.", "date": "Feb 18, 2008"}
