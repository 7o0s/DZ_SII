One such title let me fulfill one of my lifelong fantasies. No, I'm not talking about my jello midget thing, but my dream to rule a small tropical island with an iron fist and the determination to exploit both the land and the population to its highest limits with only my own personal gain in mind. Oh man... just thinking of it brings tears of joy to my eyes. PopTop gave me all of this with their tropical island city building economic political simulation game Tropico. They let me bring my dream of stepping on the little people without worrying of the consequences to fruition. Long live PopTop! Long live El Presidente! (That's me.) And with the addition of BreakAway Games' expansion to Tropico, entitled Paradise Island, the dream has just moved even closer with some great additions and fixes to gameplay that make it even more fun, if not that much easier.   You see, Tropico was a really interesting and fun game for a variety of reasons. The main one, in my most humble El Presidente opinion (which you must accept or be thrown in prison), was the fairly robust political system that pit various factions either with you or against you. There were so many factors involved in the way these factions, and the individual citizens that made up the factions, made their decisions about why they liked you or not, it was a constant struggle to keep all appeased. My long dream of total domination of small and insignificant people was much more difficult than I anticipated. This was a challenge I was willing to accept however and had quite a good time despite the fact that the whiny little citizens living in their apartment complexes, that only ten years before had been living in shacks, had so much free time on their hands to bitch at me about not enough churches or the fact that they were dying from sickness or that they felt oppressed by all of the police and soldiers... wah!   Despite that, there were some issues that I had some contention with. And happily, some of those have been resolved. The first and foremost of these issues, which I think may be the biggest and best improvement of the bunch, is the faster construction time for all of the buildings. The fact that it took me 35 years to build an airport in one of the scenarios I played in the original game didn't really sit right with me. In the span that took the United States to move from computers the size of a building to palm pilots, my lazy ass workers built one lousy airport... Of course I had them all imprisoned for their laziness, but I can't really say that inspired them. BreakAway did manage to inspire them with a few more numbers here and there in the code and voila: we have some much faster working builders that you can count on. In fact, it only took my team of workers 10 years to build an airport in a heavily wooded area. Not perfect, but definitely an improvement for the lazy bastards.   Laying out your city has been neatly improved as well with quite a few of the buildings getting the option to rotate. Not all of the ones I might have liked, but it's certainly an improvement. You can now also cancel construction on buildings that haven't yet been started and get all of your money back. There was nothing more frustrating than accidentally placing a building in the wrong place and then having the game decide that you, El Presidente, should pay for this transgression! Preposterous! But that's been fixed now so I can relax a bit.   Finally I have the time to devote myself to caring for the good of my people. Okay, maybe not the good of my people so much as the fear of my people. The military gets a big leg up in this expansion with one huge addition that will please any would-be dictators out there. You can now build an army base.  What did you think of Tropico: Paradise Island?  This allows a couple of things. First off, you can house and care for any of the soldiers that live on your base. This keeps them happy and, as long as they're well paid, loyal. The other huge advantage this building bestows on you is the opening of one of the six new edicts. This one just happens to be conscription. This means anyone, including the uneducated can be soldiers making your force something to be reckoned with. Fun, fun, fun! So finally you can take your time to grind your boot heel into the last glimmering chance of hope for these downtrodden souls.   Alas, Paradise Island, as the name implies, was not all about the subjugation of your people. In fact, the main idea behind the expansion was the addition of many more tourist activities and attractions to make it a viable form of income for your tiny island country. No longer will you need to be totally dependant on your farms and industry to keep your island running, tourism becomes a viable alternative, even if it still doesn't make quite the income as selling cigars.   But helping you along on your quest to secure total financial mastery on your island and ~accidentally~ misplace some of that money into your Swiss bank account are several new tourist buildings as well as a new edict to get some of those sweet money burning spring breakers onto your island and another to bring the eco-tourists in. Making money may not be quite as fun for me as military might, but building up your town into a bustling little tourist attraction definitely has its own charm. With new buildings like tennis courts, and miniature golf, and a swanky new marina, things can look a little nicer if you plan things right.   To take advantage of all of the new add ins such as the buildings, edicts, and president attributes, a bunch of new scenarios have been designed to give you bang for your buck. The scenarios are divided into types this time with tourism and military advantage in their own directories and the miscellaneous missions on their own. Some of these are damn hard. When it says very hard on the intro page, that really does mean it's very hard.   People are still as whiny as they always are and are surprisingly so in certain situations. Take one of the easy missions for example. You get stuck on this island and have to build an airport to get off of it... not sure why when you have a dock and boats coming to the dock, but whatever. So you're put in charge with nothing but a few people and a couple of buildings on this tiny-ass island. You start building so you can gather enough money to leave the island, and suddenly the capitalists are complaining that there aren't enough tourist attractions, the religious freaks are complaining there's no church, the intellectuals are complaining there's no high school... the only ones that aren't complaining are the usually loudmouthed eco terrorists and the communists that just love the menial jobs. On top of that, the US decides that your podunk little ass-backwards island with a construction post, a church, some houses, two farms, and the beginnings of an airport is important enough to get mad at you for not following the way they think. They even have the spare time to send a gun-boat out to threaten your shores because your pineapple farm is so damn important to the fate of the world.   Aside from all of the great additions and fixes, there are some issues that haven't really been fixed. What's up with the roads? Why don't people use them? Why don't people walk faster when they're on them? What the hell is the point of building them? Why do some workers decide to walk around the island for half of the year on vacation and then eat, rest, and visit church and still get paid their wages? Why are the communists complaining about housing when people won't move into my dirt-cheap tenements from their beat down shacks? Why do my construction workers on the east end of the island walk all the way to the west end of the island to work when my workers on the west end of the island walk all the way to the east end of the island to work? Why the hell can't I buy them a car? Why does nothing El ~Much-Hated~ Presidente do make his people happy? Have I not given them food? Have I not built them homes? Have I not burned their evil books?   Oh, you ungrateful little Tropicans... I'll make your lives good alright, and I'll have fun doing it!   So do I recommend picking Paradise Island up? Sure thing. There's plenty here to enjoy if you're a fan of Tropico. It really does fix most of the main annoyances even if some issues are still prevalent. The new additions and the new fantastic music all are worth the time to experience. The humor and charm that was so good in the original are still there waiting to surprise you as well. If you've been itching to get back into the dictatorial saddle, then Tropico: Paradise Island is certainly a good excuse.", "date": "Feb 14, 2002"}
