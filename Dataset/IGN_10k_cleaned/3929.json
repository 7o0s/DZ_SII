It began ambitiously with true 3D courses and it soon added the analog swing method, which revolutionized it and breathed life into it. With each year's new iteration since, we've seen new courses and new players but the advances have always been small steps forward -- not leaps. This is the same with Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 for the most part. It has the additional courses, the new PGA pros, and even some new modes.    However, in Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 there are some surprising new additions that make it a truly worthy upgrade over last year's version. So if you are the proud owner of Tiger 2003, or any previous version, there are a number of reasons to trade it in for EA's latest effort with the series.   The FactsEA's long-standing golf franchise is refined for yet another year  Return of the Total Precision analog swing  Create yourself with the detailed Game Face mode  Experience 19 different courses, including real-life PGA certified ones and EA's fantasy creations  Play as or against 15 PGA pros, including the newly added John Daly and Adam Scott  12 fantasy characters available in addition to the PGA masters  Totally revamped World Tour mode sends you around the globe to compete for big earnings  A true 52-week PGA Tour Mode is now available for play  Uses the hardware's internal clock and calendar for real-time events  Now includes a full-fledged Pro Shop with over a thousand items for sale  Get sponsored to earn gear and cash from big names like Callaway, Nike, and Ping  Brand-new play types including Battle Golf, Long Drive Shootout, Best Ball, Stableford, and Alternate Shot  New announcing team: Feherty returns, but Gary McCord provides new narration  Console-exclusive features: GameCube links to GBA, PS2 goes online, and Xbox provides custom soundtrack support  PlayStation 2 features extensive online options: play in daily tournaments, peer-to-peer, track your stats, and much more  Special features unlocked from EA Sports Bio  No progressive scan supported  No widescreen supportGameplay  EA has used the last year of development time wisely. Since Tiger 2003 had set the foundation for basic gameplay firmly in place, the team took the opportunity to flesh out this year's features set with all-new modes. Before discussing those, however, let's consider what the basic upgrades are this year. There are, of course, new courses; Bethpage Black, one of the world's most difficult locales, is now on the slate. You won't even need to unlock it to test your skills on it, which is very helpful for Tiger pros who want to jump right in and step up to a more difficult challenge. There are about a half-dozen new courses. They're a mix between fantasy and PGA certified ones, and let us tell you, this balance is needed. The PGA courses test your skills, especially on the greens, but only EA's fantasy courses truly challenge the full breadth of the arcade-meets-simulation gameplay mechanics. One of the new courses in Japan has some wicked par threes that, while beautiful in their own right, are deadly due to the greens' intimidating proximities to water. So, yes, we think that EA has done the right thing with the new courses. The balance is there and any play style should be accommodated.    Head-to-Head Available! This year EA has made it tough to decide on which version of Tiger to buy, because they're all so good, but have a few different features. Be sure you know what they are and buy smart.  Also: check out our detailed video review.  Read the Head-to-Head   The Tiger Challenge, which was the core single-player experience for 2003, has been revamped. Called the Would Tour mode, you conquer different areas of the globe one-by-one; head to the northwest U.S. to conquer courses like the new Salahee CC or to the Pacific to defeat Kapalua. Of course, the main draw is that you have to defeat both PGA and fantasy golfers on these courses. Yes, Erika ~Ice,~ The Don, Tsunami, and many more have returned, and they'll be playing just a little harder than before. World Tour is a really excellent mode for the casual videogame golfer. You're not locked into 12 months of serious gameplay where a few losses will damage your whole career. It's setup to be a good range of easy to extremely difficult, but you'll be earning a lot of money while unlocking content at the same time. For the single player you'll spend, at least, 10 hours playing this mode. Chances are with losses and unsatisfying victories you'll be back for much more than that. It makes for a much better presented core single-player mode than last year.     World Tour is challenging, so even for pros, there's more than enough reason to play and, definitely, enjoy it. But, our biggest complaint about the franchise has always been that despite its name, Tiger Woods 2004 PGA Tour, it has lacked a true PGA tour recently on the consoles. It almost seems a bit ridiculous when you think about it, but EA was clearly pushing the franchise toward all gamers, even if they didn't follow golf in real life. This year that has changed. Golf fanatics can indulge in a true 52-week PGA Tour, playing against the masters; this can be done for up to 10 seasons. It's pretty basic, however, and lacks presentation. It's just you on the course, one hit after the other. While this is most welcome because you can control the pace of the game and avoid watching your opponents' shots, it gets a bit monotonous. It would have been really great if you saw picture-in-picture updates of the leaders' best and worst shots occasionally -- anything more than a leaderboard to diversify the experience. So, while it does stay true to the true-life experience of it just being you alone on each hole, it needs more presentation polish if it hopes to make you feel like you're part of the PGA. Nonetheless, we're sure all Tiger fans are going to be most pleased it's made the bill.    The real-time calendar events play alongside the PGA mode. There are real invitationals that occur during the year, and you'll have the opportunity to play in them on that same day in real life. Additionally there are a lot of other special events such as pro golfer and character birthday matches. Even holidays will see special golf tournaments or scenarios. For example, come this Halloween you'll have the opportunity to win a ~Haunted Polo~ shirt to spice up your wardrobe in the game. This is one example of many. These events draw from your hardware's internal clock, so you'll have to make sure it's set right all the time. It adds immensely to the replay value and we are beginning to wonder how we ever did without it. You will, no doubt, feel the same way.   A Pro Shop, too, has been added and it's mandatory to how the entire game functions. Everything -- and we mean everything -- you do in Tiger Woods 2004 eventually leads you back to the Pro Shop. As you win in World Tour, as you play on the PGA circuit, and even Scenarios will earn you new goodies. The scope of items included is pretty huge. The number is easily over 1,000 and includes gear, apparel, and accessories from Ping, Cleveland, Taylor Made, and many others. All of this stuff costs lots of cash, which gives you a good deal more incentive to play well on the courses. There are daily sales and featured items. EA poured a lot of content into it and teamed up with some pretty excellent licensees. Taking full advantage of these relationships, EA has set things up so you will eventually earn sponsorships which leads to bonuses and, of course, more gear. No golf game to date has offered this much customization and it makes a world of difference. It's another feature we could not live without. Our only complaint would be that surfing through all the items, previewing them, and the general look of it all is a bit messy. It's more utilitarian than anything else, so we really look forward to seeing how this is improved in the next version.      The king of all additions to the Tiger Woods PGA Tour franchise is the Game Face feature. It's so in-depth and satisfying you'll want to take a cold shower after perusing it. We've successfully made characters that closely resemble a number of the IGN editors; yes, it's so powerful you can even make extremely ugly people. We've picked our jaws up off the floor repeatedly. EA wants you to play as you in this year's version, and with enough patience and skill you'll be doing just that. You can tweak just about everything. Sure, it has the standard stuff -- hairstyles, facial hair, face types, skin color, etc. -- but it's the ability to tweak the size of individual bones, body mass, and so on that is really amazing. We're absolutely positive it will quickly find its way into other EA franchises like NBA Street -- it's just too good not to have around. Combined with the Pro Shop, it's just short of living digitally inside the golfing world EA has created. It's the ultimate in newfangled-ness. For those that don't care much for it, you can randomize a character easily.   IGN's Fran Mirabella tries to recreate himself.  Indeed, Game Face is what really brings everything together this year, making the franchise as cohesive and complete as it has ever been. The last thing you need to check off your list is the fact that Tiger Woods PGA 2004 plays wonderfully. The analog swing and the intuitive nature of the entire product really make it the best golf title there is for consoles -- period. However, there are still some things we feel that EA is overlooking. If you've ever played Tiger Woods before, there's a good chance you've mastered the straight shot. Very unlike real golf, it is cake to strike the ball perfectly and send it in the direction you want. What a lot of the gameplay boils down to then is guessing distances and placing spin on the ball, which is even easier when you consider the fact you can do it after the ball is in the air. This is great for the arcade golfer, but it leaves simulation fans much to be desired.    At this point, Tiger Woods PGA Tour could really benefit from having sliders, allowing players to adjust the ~looseness~ of the analog swing. This way driving off the tee wouldn't be so focused on just the distance factor. Likewise, putting on the greens has really made no headway with 2004. You must still read the greens based on EA's dotted line, which shows how the ball will break if you aimed directly at the hole. It really feels quite different from the skill of reading greens in real golf. To remedy this a little, EA has included the option for you to use the grid system, which coats the green to reveal its breaks. However, it's pretty untraditional in size and, thus, only helps you read the speed of the break at the hole, as opposed to the green undulations leading to it. The camera can also be bothersome quite frequently, often blocking the dotted line behind your golfer's body, which forces you to rely on the caddy tips.      Overall, though, we're ecstatic for Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004. The new features, which we hope are here for good, are fantastic additions. If you've never had any issues with the gameplay mechanics in recent Tiger Woods titles, you have no choice but to admit this is the best in the series yet; subsequently, you should get to the store immediately and trade in last year's version. However, if that simulation golfer in you can't shake the want for a little more refinement of the controls, you should know there's only been minor tweaks over 2003. To EA's credit, though, the PC version is designed to suit these needs, sporting a much less forgiving set of physics and controls.    Multiplayer & Online  Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 is especially addicting when it comes to multiplayer. In fact, we would argue it's one of its biggest strengths. It's inherent to the gameplay, which is more enjoyable when you're facing opponents that aren't artificial. The replay value is through the roof here with a litter of simulation and arcade modes, including Stroke Play, Best Ball for brilliant team matches, Stableford, Long Drive Shootout, and Battle Golf. The latter is a riot, as the winner of each hole gets to yank a club from his or her opponent's bag (barring the putter). It goes without saying, really, that if you enjoy golf this is one of the best multiplayer titles you can buy.   When you factor in that the PlayStation 2 features a wealth of online play, the deal gets even sweeter. There are tournaments six days a week, online rankings, you can challenge anyone almost anytime, and there are exclusive invitationals controlled by EA. Theoretically, the company could invite the top ten putters that play online to compete in a tournament. It's really quite spectacular and a major, major addition to the gameplay. EA does not support online play for GameCube or Xbox, unfortunately.    Graphics  Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 is the most detailed 3D golfer available for consoles. Its recreation of real world courses is as top-notch as you'll find in this arena. If you're familiar with last year's version, you should have a pretty good vision of what's going on here. There really haven't been many improvements. Everything is slightly sharper, but for the most part the engine is the same. Foliage still fills in, changing from sprites to polygons as the camera pans toward it, and the grass textures don't feature much more detail. Lighting and shadowing have been tweaked, giving the courses more depth, but it's still pretty subtle. Likewise, you'll notice some thicker grassy areas, which sway in the wind, here and there if you're looking. Thankfully, framerate has remained a priority and the engine churns out the fairways and greens at 60 frames per second most of the time.     Small improvements or not, though, it's still one of the absolute best-looking golfing titles available. The only thing EA has not delivered on that we've been hopeful for is HDTV support. You won't find progressive scan or widescreen, which would be absolutely gorgeous, in any of the versions.   Sound  This year David Feherty returns, but Bill Macatee has not. Instead, Feherty's new partner in fairway rhyme is Gary McCord. Thanks to this new bond, a lot of the commentary is completely new and fresh. However, McCord's announcing seems a bit more pushed than Macatee's, especially compared to Feherty's, whose is still the best they come; thankfully, you here plenty from him.    Keeping with the slightly over-the-top theme, you'll also find a whole new selection of EA Trax songs. DMX with ~Party Up~ and Rooney's ~Blue Side~ are two of the most popular tracks. A large number of other songs are from a band by the name of Just Blaze. It's a decent selection for multiplayer mode, but it's likely something you'll get tired of quite quickly -- much like what happened with 2003. On a positive note, the Xbox does support custom soundtracks -- finally our wish has come true.   Lastly, as for environmental sound effect, it's basically identical to what we heard last year. There haven't been any significant improvements in this department.I've always been a fan of the Tiger franchise, but last year's version is the one that really captured my attention. EA had finally included enough courses and modes to make it a formidable franchise. In a sense, I think it defined itself that year. Now with 2004, EA has seized the opportunity to build outward, adding an incredible Game Face mode -- not something token at all -- we now have real-time calendar events, a PGA Tour mode, and an extensive Pro Shop. The presentation has really received a solid boost and all these great features have rounded out the experience marvelously. And, the online mode which is exclusive to the PlayStation 2 version is absolute fantastic. I couldn't gush enough about it. Buy a modem or broadband adapter and get online with this game. It's free and it rocks -- the replay value is through the roof if you go online.It goes without saying that I highly recommend this year's version as a buy if you owned Tiger 2003 and played it extensively. Of course, even as satisfied as I am, there are still areas I want to see improved. The development team tweaked some of the controls to make the experience a bit smoother, but it's still quite arcadey. This will definitely satisfy a lot of the gamers out there, but for golfers who actually play golf, or have played golf, everything from teeing off to putting in Tiger Woods PGA Tour still feels a bit out of place. It'd be really fantastic if in future versions the player could access a Pro mode and control a slider bar that affected the Total Precision Swing system whether you set it towards ~arcade~ or ~simulation.~ Because, for me, teeing off isn't so much about hitting the ball straight as it is how much power I can get behind it.Nonetheless, there's no other golf game I'd rather play this year and there's no reason you shouldn't feel the same way.", "date": "Sep 22, 2003"}
