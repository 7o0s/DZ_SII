So it's a good thing EA Sports did a great job with this game, and the followers of Ohio, Nebraska, Tennessee and the rest will find little to complain about here, as this year's version of NCAA Football fields believable gameplay, a healthy array of coaching options, and admirable graphics and animations.  In particular the way you go about calling plays is commendable. First you select one of the formations, which are arranged in a logical order. Then you select the play, and can further alter the formation to load one side or the other. Though it takes some getting used to, with practice, playcalling becomes quite effective.  You cannot, however, edit your own plays, but since you do control one player on the field, here (as with most football games), you can improv all kinds of blitzes. The game should default to a FG kick play on the PAT, though, and to a punt return on 4th down, instead of making you scroll around.  Each team uses a different playbook, and you are free to go in and tweak them how you like, including changing the default audibles and subbing players for particular plays.  Teams like Navy that rely on old-fashioned formations such as the wishbone and T-formation are loaded with those plays, while an option offense like Nebraska has the right mix of attacks. Eight man fronts and dynamic, NFL-style blitzes can be devastating, but frequently leave you vulnerable to the run, option, or streak.  And that's probably the game's greatest strength. Unlike the percentage pass-style feel of the NFL, the running game is alive and well in much of college football, and NCAA Football 99 has a really solid running game. Special moves like spins, dives and stiff-arms (I've found no use for the juke, given the speed and scale of the game) are easy to use while controlling the running back, and off tackle T-formation runs can gain a lot of ground, depending of course on which teams and players are on the field.  The kicking game is more problematic, particularly with the kick meter. It simply moves too fast. Running the ball back on special teams at first seems like a chore, but just when I thought I'd never break the big one, I returned a kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown. (Okay I was Ohio State against the Wyoming Cowboys, but at least it can be done.)  Control is not perfect, and there are problems with the SideWinder sending players in the wrong direction. Passing is also something of a chancy proposition because of the camera angles and a lack of a target for the quarterback. If you're all about the long ball, you might want to wait to see how we fare with the next Madden.  Only two camera angles are usable in action mode--the EA Sports cam, which is pretty close in on the action, much like a TV broadcast, and the more distant press box cam. I generally ended up using the latter, more useful for both running and passing, though the game does not put a marker under the computer's ball carrier when you're on defense, which can result in some costly errors.  Otherwise the graphics, motion capture, stadiums, and the rest are fine, on par with or exceeding professional commercial game work in late 1998. Currently the game supports only the 3Dfx chipsets, but a Direct3D patch is on the way.  And the other camera angles are plenty for the coaching only mode, which lets you call the plays, substitute players, and stalk around the sidelines without being able to make your players do what you want, just like a real NCAA coach.  Further joys await the would-be clipboard carrier. The game has something of a career mode, and though players come and go, a football program must go on. After each season you lose players to the NFL draft, and then you come back and can make selections for future recruits, by putting points on different positions, usually to fill holes left by drafted players. You allocate points (out of 100) for these positions, but it's not just Wide Receiver or Cornerback--you actually can pick speed, hands or other specialties for each of the skill positions. So if you just lost a Steve McNair, you might be on the lookout for a speedy QB. However you never get down to say a Baseball Mogul scale of dollars and sense, something perhaps future installments can explore.  Speaking of the players, they are not actually named in the game, but you can go in and add names as you like, and most common American football names, like Johnson, Young and so on, are stored in the audio database, allowing the (otherwise colorless and lackluster) play-by-play man to use real names.  Beyond the exhibition, tournament and dynasty modes, EA Sports also did college aficionados a favor by including some 50 all time great college games going back to the late 1940s, allowing diehards to relive the glory days of years gone by, although frankly the only game I remember from this lot was that wild Stanford-Cal game, when the blinking marching band got on the field.  But not all is wine and roses. At times, the interface and menus outside of the actual 3D game become downright imponderable. For example, trying to set up your Dynasty mode team is accomplished through a series of peculiar mouse clicks, button pushes, and hitting the enter key. And as you move through a season, simming one week requires right-clicking, holding down the right click, and then pressing button two on the gamepad. I can't remember another game in which I needed both a mouse and a gamepad to accomplish what on the face of it would seem like a relatively straightforward task.  When the season actually ends, there are several more cumbersome hurdles to pass before you land on the screen that tells you which players you lost in the NFL draft. (The draft can be a rather heartbreaking experience, and one learns sympathy for real college coaches who must endure this ordeal every year.)  Another more pressing problem is the game's ridiculous and completely unreasonable loading times. Without even having the actual 3D game engine loaded, it usually took between fifteen and twenty seconds to move from one menu screen to the next on, a P200 with 64 MB of RAM, an excruciating process accompanied by excessive CD accesses, ignominious skips in the repetitive rah-rah music, and long periods of static, black screens. The game never did actually crash, though, to its credit.  But these are pretty minor points (well, the long-loading times probably rate as more than minor), and overall most of my displeasure came not from what EA Sports had done with the game, but with the nature of college football itself--because in college football the schedules of the contenders are padded out with patsies, yielding lopsided, boring games, and the national champion is chosen not by a system of winning a division and advancing through playoffs, but through some incoherent, archaic method of ranking teams and sending them to oddly-named bowl games, apparently at random, to determine the ~national champion~.  And you can't fault EA Sports for that.  --Jason Bates", "date": "Sep 12, 1998"}
