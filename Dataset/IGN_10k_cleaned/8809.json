{"name": "James Bond", "name_review": "James Bond 007", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/06/24/james-bond-007", "text": "The James Bond myth has been played out in numerous media over the past three decades. Books, movies, music, television spoofs-and yes, even video games. Agent 007 is famous (and infamous) for his perpetual consumption of martinis, bullets, gadgets, and women. Now Nintendo is hoping that gamers consume James Bond 007, which features Bond in a variety of dangerous situations that span the globe.   Features  Single-player only. Battery backed memory. Three game save slots. Game-within-a-Game (choose from three different card games). Business-like dialogue peppered with occasional witty remarks and the usual sprinkling of PG rated innuendo. Average game control-watch out for Bond running into doors and sometimes being off his shooting aim. Difficulty level: Medium to Hard   The Game  The game certainly attempts to draw on Bond's established charm and the enormous popularity of the Nintendo 64 game Goldeneye. But unlike its N64 cousin, James Bond 007 offers the world of Her Majesty's Secret Service from an RPG perspective, focusing not only on helping Bond kill the bad guys but also on completing certain strategic tasks to reach the ultimate goal of destroying a weapons smuggling ring. In the course of completing this treacherous mission, Bond will encounter allies, battle familiar foes, and cultivate friendly (but not too friendly) relationships with the opposite sex.    The game's underlying philosophy resembles that of other RPGs: guide Bond to different parts of the Eastern Hemisphere in order to accomplish a series of objectives. These objectives include shooting down enemies of sinister foreign heritage, acquiring unique gadgets, making useful contacts, being briefed by 'M' and 'Q', and collaborating with comely female love interests. In most cases, Bond advances to the next level by defeating 'bosses' that threaten him with extinction, emasculation, and other horrors. Of course, Bond manages to mix business with pleasure and, in one particularly entertaining part of the game, manages to stop by a casino and engage in some realistic and challenging gambling. Once you've finished the game in its entirety, codes will be displayed that will allow you to play the card games of Black Jack, Red Dog, and Baccarat at will.   Bond's arsenal of weapons and gadgets is accessible by pushing the select button. He is permitted to carry two items from his arsenal at any given time. The array of goodies ranges from low-tech (fists only and the trusty Walther PPK) to high-tech (laser watch and missile launcher). Such a wide selection of contraptions enhances the 'license to kill' mandate given to our hero. The only thing that Bond truly lacks is decent navigational system. The so-called 'satellite link' that is supposed to pinpoint 007's location is a poor excuse for a map. It doesn't show any of the places Bond has or has not visited and in fact, shows nothing but a blinking dot on a blank grid. The blinking dot is supposed to represent Bond, but big deal. As many of the levels Bond explores turn out to be repetitively rendered mazes, the omission of a suitable mapping system seems a huge oversight.   One of this game's peculiarities is the fact that once Bond has finished a level, he is whisked off to the next level, never to return to the site of his former conquest. In fact, the only way to return to a previously played area is to start over from the beginning. Of course, having played this game a few times, I've realized that there is very little incentive for a player to want to return to a completed level. Everything Bond needs in each level is readily accessible-just do the right things in the right order and voila! your passport to the next exotic location is guaranteed.    The game's graphics vary from level to level. In some areas (the Russian nuclear waste dump, for example) the landscape is redundant and not very inspiring. Other areas, like Marrakech, are more varied and provide a nice range of physical locations. The game's characters are creatively rendered and pleasing to look at in all their diminutive glory. Bond is tiny and natty-looking (the GQ look downsized) and the rest of the characters are attired in a way that helps to establish their specific personalities or general roles. Especially amusing are the harem women and the labcoat-clad scientists in 'Q's headquarters.    The Bond theme acts as a constant reminder that, yes, you are on 007's rough and tumble turf. Also catchy is the casino score, which does a good job of creating a swank, swinging lounge atmosphere. Other songs are nice while they last, but don't have too much of an impact.  Too bad the sound effects don't live up to larger-than-life quality of the Bond myth. Most of the weapon effects are puny and mechanical-a bullet should 'boom,' not 'blip.' And as for the game's human contingent, Bond and his supporting cast utter nary a sniff. This silence tends to render the game's characters a little shallow in the 'personality' category. It would have been really swell to hear the enemies groan in pain as they bite the dust, or to have Bond make refined grunting noises with each barrage of bullets he bravely bears.    Bond covers lots of ground in this game, but somehow it doesn't seem like enough. Compared with other RPGs, this one could have stood to be at least three or four levels longer. The game does, however, offer a few hidden items and features that may be missed the first time around. Then again, these items and features alter the gameplay only slightly and do not present any substantially different route of adventure for Bond to embark upon. Should you put the game away for a few months, you might take some satisfaction in playing it again if you've forgotten exactly how to beat it. Also, being able to play the card games outside of the RPG context is a nice touch. But for the most part, the game does not contain the depth and breadth that one normally expects from an RPG.  One refreshing aspect of this game is the way in which it expands the RPG genre into the modern-day world of high-tech espionage. For whatever reason, the James Bond mystique has a powerful hold on the public's imagination, and this game provides a miniature glimpse into the glamorous world of 007. Playing the game will leave you stirred, maybe shaken, and quite reasonably entertained. Monica Wilbur reviews games for IGNpocket's #1 affiliate, GBCDojo.
