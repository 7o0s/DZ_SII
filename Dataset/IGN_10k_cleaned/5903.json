The two sit next to each other on the decks, almost as a taunt to consumers -- but I'm going to make the decision easy for you. The X-Files: The Deserter is a good game. The other, well, is not. And for some very obvious reasons.   Perhaps the biggest thing The X-Files: The Deserter has going for in the face of its competition is the presence of the series' stars: Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. The game smartly gives the player the opportunity to play with each character, casting them in roles most appropriate for the character. Mulder is the field man, send to Las Vegas to investigate something strange, while Scully is back at the lab, helping Mulder on her end by providing analysis.   If you recall playing PC adventure games from a decade back, you'll feel very at home with the mechanics of The X-Files: The Deserter. The game is primarily menu-driven, with gamers using a set list of options and commands to make Mulder interact with the scenes and environments. You have commands like ~use~ and ~look at~ that are typical of this now-dormant genre and because the game limits the amount of actions you can use in each of the game's screens, getting through this adventure isn't as troublesome as it could have been, save for a few puzzles that seem unfortunately esoteric for an adventure game. It's not that the puzzles has a necessarily difficult solution, but that's sometimes executing the correct order of commands requires a lot of guessing that extends the length of the game artificially.   The X-Files: The Deserter does manage to recreate the atmosphere of the show, which is an absolute must for a game based on such a beloved license. Again, the presence of the agents goes a long way. The screens are well-drawn with a good use of color (not bright, but properly muted for just like the television show) and there is some nice animation from time to time. I wish there was more in terms of audio, though.The X-Files: The Deserter offers fans a solid mobile experience, but I'm afraid that some of the far-out solutions to the puzzles will keep more than a few people from finishing the game. Puzzles that are difficult to complete because of interface just feel unfair, and somewhat mar the game. However, the classic menu-driven system still holds up, in my opinion. Navigating many of the screens is a breeze for older gamers that grew up on classic Lucasarts adventures, like Maniac Mansion. If you must have a Mulder-stamped game on your handset, The X-Files: The Deserter is the one to choose between the two offerings.", "date": "Aug 2, 2005"}
