{"name": "Rally Cross", "name_review": "Rally Cross Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/01/30/rally-cross-review", "text": "Rally Cross was originally released in late 1997 by Sony Computer Entertainment and was one of the best rally games on the system at that point. With four-player split-screen support available via the MultiTap, the game made for a great party experience due to its (somewhat) pick-up-and-play mechanics, chaotic nature and simple setup.   The game was released shortly before the Dual Shock became available for the original PlayStation, and while it did feature forward-thinking support for the analog stick, the game was designed with D-Pad control in mind. The PSP emulator for PSone titles doesn't seem to feature full analog support at the moment anyway, so this is a moot point.     Regardless of whatever the reason for this is, the result is that Rally Cross feature sluggish controls. Your vehicle takes a second or two to hit full spin on the steering wheel, which means you need to plan your turns way ahead of time. The ability to lean your car certainly helps, but it doesn't quite make up for the lagged handling.   While it's essentially an easy game to get your hands around, Rally Cross does require a fair bit of practice before you're able to pull in a first place victory, largely in part due to these control issues. The track designs are short and cramped, and combined with the steering, very unforgiving. Your car will flip over on its top very often if you're not careful, and rolling back over again can take quite a bit of time. In other words, a single error during a race can leave you in last place for the remainder of the session.   It's worth noting that all of our gripes with the controls and unforgiving track design are part of the original game - the PSP emulation looks to be perfect, so if you were a fan of the game way back when, you'll have no problem with this release. In fact, the PSP emulator's control schemes allow rather natural control over the game, if you opt for an automatic transmission that is. You can replace the shifters on the L and R buttons with the lean controls and move the transmission controls to the analog stick, which makes things pretty easy to control. If you really want to go with a manual transmission however, you're going to have a whole lot of thumb position shifting ahead of you.    There really isn't a whole lot of depth to Rally Cross, with a simple race-after-race Career progression ahead of you, a Quick Race mode and a Suicide mode where you race the track backwards while everyone else races forward. As is the case with all other PSone games on the PSP, multiplayer support isn't, well, supported, so it loses points for total lack of its party draw.Rally Cross can be a reasonably fun game if you spend enough time to really learn the courses and get into the game. You need to came at it with a good and open attitude however as it's largely unforgiving, especially at the start. The lack of multiplayer is disappointing as it would certainly be fun, and manual racers need not apply.", "date": "Jan 30, 2007"}
