The sequel takes everything that made the original such a popular and enjoyable title and has added some new questions, more voiceovers and some brand new categories.   Gameplay You Don't Know Jack, Mock 2 can be played with one, two or three players, but it's really meant to be played with two or three, as the single player game is pretty pointless and just isn't too enjoyable. The gameplay is quite simple as it's essentially a basic game show game where you are given a question and the first person to buzz in is allowed to guess the answer. If you get the correct answer, you win the allotted point total, which is usually between $1,000 and $3,000, and if you pick the wrong answer, you lose that same amount.   While this is basic fair, the game is by no means your run-of-the-mill game show game. Where Mock 2 really sets itself apart from the rest of the pack is that its questions, answers and overall presentation is the funniest that you'll ever see in a game show. The types of questions that are asked and the way that they are asked are just so amazingly funny and will have most people laughing their asses off throughout the entire game.   Moreover, the questions aren't overly difficult nor are they too easy and they generally have a perfect balance to them. The game also mixes up the basic Q&A setup, which has a question and four multiple choice answers available to you, with some very cool bonus rounds that will have you try to get as many correct answers in particular category, which is generally pretty wild, during a specific time limit. The game's simply a blast to play and is one of the most enjoyable games that you'll find on PlayStation or any other console system.   Graphics Well, what can I say about the game's graphics? The visuals of You Don't Know Jack, Mock 2 are pretty much non-existent and completely important to the value of the game. The text is clear and easy to read and that is really all that matters here. Sure, you might be able to add some flashy polygonal graphics or eye candy to improve it, but the extra load times that would be involved would probably just hurt the fun factor of the whole thing. There's nothing really here visually and that's probably for the best.   Sound While the graphics are fairly unimportant and non-existent, the game's audio is the focal point of the game and is the area where it really shines. The host of the game show, Cookie, does a splendid job of delivering the different questions and jokes in a perfect manner and the jokes range from very witty and well written to so off the wall that you just have to laugh because you can't believe what was just said.   What's more, the game's designers have done a impressive job with crafting the game so that the jokes made by the commentator are related to the current category of questions being asked. The host will often refer to questions that were asked earlier in the round and will make jokes about topics similar to that of the current theme. Thanks to the game's fantastic audio presentation, hilarious jokes, and excellent writing, You Don't Know Jack, Mock 2 is easily one of the best party games that you'll find on PlayStation. The difficulty level of the questions seem to be a perfect fit for people of all intellects and because many are related to pop-culture, just about anyone who's been alive for at least the past 10 or so years shouldn't have to much problem coming up with at least a few right answers. While it's almost completely worthless as a single player game, the game's multiplayer appeal is almost limitless and it's a worthy title to have in your PlayStation library if you ever play games with friends. In fact, even if you don't have any friends, it might be worth picking up this game just so you can try and make some new ones.", "date": "Nov 8, 2000"}
