Such was the case for THQ's Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy, a console adventure game that offered great platforming action with good character work and smart presentation. It's biggest sin? It wasn't based on a television show or enjoyed a hyped-up multi-million dollar ad campaign. So it sat on shelves, quickly sent to the bargain bin where it hopefully found a secondary audience that appreciated it.   Hopefully, the mobile edition of Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy won't fall victim to the same fate. The games sits in the middle of decks, crowded with games based on summer movies or the still popular poker, distractions that may be too much for many mobile gamers to look past and see this slick little game.   Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy takes some of the same concepts from the console game and places them in an isometric-viewed adventure. You control two characters -- Sphinx and a Mummy. Your goal is to collect preserved organs that will resurrect the Mummy, but first you must uncover the Book of the Dead so you can chase the evil Anubis to the Helipolis Temple.   Sphinx is more of a ~shoot first~ kinda guy, so his sequences are filled with swordplay and throwing darts. Extra darts are located in jars, which can be broken with sword swipes. Darts are somewhat under an auto-aim spell that is loose. When you're sorta facing a jar or an enemy, a yellow rectangle appears around it, signaling that it will be struck by a thrown dart. The appearance of the rectangle isn't as steady and trustworthy as you'll want it to be. After a while, you'll likely just stick to using the sword whenever humanly possible.   The Mummy's sequences are more action-puzzles. Since the Mummy is already dead, he can subject himself to tortures like setting his bandages on fire or shocking himself with electric magic. These effects only last so long, and you must usually run from checkpoint to checkpoint, setting things on fire or shocking them to open doors. The Mummy has no attacks, so he must avoid enemy contact, lest the effect wear off immediately.   The concepts work. The puzzle sequences are especially fun, because more often than not, you're working to fulfill a goal that Sphinx cannot -- such as getting a door open that will not open by traditional means. As Sphinx, most doors only open if the room has been cleared of enemies. While playing, you must also collect scarabs which unlock bonus content. That adds replay, something more mobile games really need.   Unfortunately, the controls aren't as user-friendly as they need to be to win over some gamers. Thanks to the isometric angle, you move in what looks like diagonals but you control it through basic up, down, left, right inputs. So, when you move up, your on-screen character moves up-right. In some of the more time-sensitive moments, such as some of the Mummy puzzles, this gets too twitchy and touchy. There is one puzzle in particular where the Mummy must electrify itself and touch a bunch of poles while avoiding giant insects get frustrating a lot sooner than it should. Trying to outrun the bug before the electricity fizzles out is a frantic exercise (did they really have to put so many blocks in the way?) made unnecessarily difficult when you forget about the freaky controls.   Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy has great presentation. The character sprites are well drawn and while they don't exactly possess a lot of animation, they look good scrambling around the mazes. The rooms have a limited texture set, but they all feature different lay-outs and sometimes there are unique features that really stand out. The game has limited audio, which is a shame, but since the game itself is of some considerable size, something had to be jettisoned, yes?  Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy is a good game that woulda been great if the controls had been smoothed out. I downloaded it on an LG VX8000 and would have likely cruised through it a little quicker if it hadn't been for moments I had to replay over and over thanks to walking into a pit and having to keep doing puzzle segments over. But save for that problem -- which is certainly nothing to gloss over -- Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy is a pretty good purchase for fans of the original console game or in the hunt for an adventure title.", "date": "Jul 14, 2005"}
