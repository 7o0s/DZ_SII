So I suppose I ought to pass on the most obvious way I could lead this review off and just go straight to the game proper.  Which I suppose is appropriate for the situation, since Vanguard Bandits is a game that does not exert much effort as far as pleasantries are concerned, either.  It's well-done insofar as it does exactly what it's expected to do, and it scores points in a way for doing something hardly anyone else bothers with anymore, but I doubt anyone who doesn't happen to have an interest in the genre it occupies should have any interest in it at all.   First things first, this is not a role-playing game.  If you want exploration, puzzle-solving, any kind of independent movement whatsoever, you will not find it here.  Even more so than Final Fantasy Tactics or the Shining Force series, VB is turn-based skirmish-scale strategy, and nothing but.  As far as structure is concerned, it almost exactly resembles the combat sequences in Shining Force III, albeit with a little less emphasis on terrain interaction and complex objectives.  It also isn't quite so obnoxiously hard in the early going - I didn't actually lose a battle until about fifteen missions in.  It also offers the friendly feature of letting KO'd comrades return after a pyrrhic victory; not like Tactics, where the dead stayed that way to my endless frustration.  Anyway, if you've played SFIII, you know more or less what to expect.  Battles take place between squads of little sprite robots on 3D terrain, which you can rotate with the shoulder buttons.  When one robot launches an attack at another, the scene shifts to a 3D cutscene, where you see the outcome of the single combat.  Well, perhaps I should call things by their right names.  Strictly speaking, the giant robots are called ATACs, a term which should raise a little chuckle from all the other pathetic scum who read every Robotech novel when they were in junior high.  The excavated remnants of a prior civilization, a la Xenogears, they are the primary weapon of war in VB's world.  The comparison to Xenogears may be a little off, though - I think the game is some kind of heir in spirit to Vasteel, the action-strategy mech game for the Turbografx-CD that Working Designs brought out way back in the day.  One way or the other, it doesn't make much difference, since VB seems to tell its own self-contained story.  Not the most compelling of stories, mind you, but it's enough to keep one from heaving one's guts up at the prospect of another battle, which is exactly what a story is for in a game like this.  Discussions of the story in a Working Designs game naturally bring up the subject of their philosophy in translation.  My personal opinion varies frequently, tending to average out around ~whatever floats their boat~ (with brief spikes of savage anger whenever I remember Silhouette Mirage), so I suppose I'll just say that if you already like WD's stuff, this won't change your mind, and the same goes for those of you who don't like it.  I would like to note, however, that it's a little bit jarring to get hit by PMS gags out of nowhere after a long slog through several windows of stiff, pseudo-medieval fustian.  Back to the combat system, which is nine-tenths of the game anyway.  While it should be completely friendly to players of stuff like SF, Tactics, or the Ogre games, there are a few unique odds and ends to distinguish Vanguard Bandits.  In an echo of the Battletech system, one of the primary strategic issues is managing both the energy you use to execute attacks and the unwanted by-products of those attacks.  Each mech has two meters, AP and FP (never mind what they mean).  AP are expended when you move and attack, and are replenished each turn.  Thus, if you want to execute a more powerful attack, you can't necessarily move as far as you'd like.  There's also FP to be taken into account, which build up when you attack, defend, or especially counterattack - when an enemy attacks you, you can respond with any of your regular attacks, but at a massive cost in FP.  Build up 100 FP and you're frozen for a turn, a sitting duck to be surrounded and destroyed.  So you have to balance your aggression with the considerations of a possible response.  There are other interesting issues to consider, like balancing out your party development - if your big guns hog all the experience, you'll have an unbalanced, ineffective team.  And terrain, and positioning, equiment, special skills, support abilities, all that fun stuff that makes a strategy game more than just chess with nicer graphics.  Many of the features have fairly transparent effects, but it's obvious that they have an influence, and some of them are simply fun in and of themselves.  The ~interview~ system, wherein you chat with your troops before battle, may or may not affect their morale and actual performance - I couldn't tell - but the one-liners are pretty entertaining.  The graphics, speaking of which (before I got lost there) are indeed pretty nice, as far as this sort of thing goes.  There are none of Tactics' nifty 3D constructions - the battlefields are strictly utilitarian - but I like the mech design, both the quality of the 3D rendering and the visual designs themselves.  They're most of them straight out of Five Star Stories, with that sharp-edged, fluted medieval sort of look to them, but just because they aren't that original doesn't necessarily mean they aren't pleasant to look at.  They grow old after a while, though, but as it turns out, you can turn the cutscenes off (which I didn't discover until after I beat the game the first time, sad to say).  You'll probably tire of them as well, since there are only so many to see, and the loading times are just long enough to be a little bit aggravating.  There also seems to be a funny little bug in the post-cutscene loading routine.  In maybe one scene out of five or seven, the closing load freezes the screen for an unusual amount of time and produces some unsettling drive noises.  Nothing untoward ever happened, but it always felt as if something was about to crash.  This is, make no mistake, a niche product.  It's slow, fairly repetitive, and visually unassuming when compared to the PlayStation lineup as a whole; in other words, it's a strategy game.  Oh, and before I forget, the soundtrack and effects are about as bland as the mind could conceive, so dull that, like I say, I almost forgot to mention it.  Late in the game I resorted to the alternative of plugging the video into my TV from my PlayStation and plugging my CD player into the audio in, resulting in Vanguard Bandits accompanied by Eminem's Marshall Mathers LP.  Fun juxtaposition: mind-controlled hero slaughters his comrades to the tune of ~Amityville.~  Yes, there are the vocal tracks WD did themselves, but I went hammering on the mute button at the first sign.  Sorry, personal bias.  If you happened to like the music in Lunar, though, I'm sure you'll enjoy VB's songs as well.  And if you happen to like this kind of strategy game, I'm sure you'll find Vanguard Bandits worth the purchase.  If you get into it, it's got plenty of replay value - there are fifty-six missions total, but you can see the credits after less than half that, leaving other plot branches to be explored after multiple playthroughs.  Again, though, it'll probably bore the majority of consumers half to death.  I suppose the best way to put it is that the PlayStation now has its own Albert Odyssey - a game that will be enjoyed by some, disliked by others, ignored by a great many, and have very little significance in any kind of long-term sense.  Which is no sin, of course, particularly in the eyes of those who wish this genre weren't about to quietly take its leave of the gaming scene.    -- David Smith", "date": "Jul 6, 2000"}
