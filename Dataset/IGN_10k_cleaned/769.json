{"name": "Family Game Pack", "name_review": "Family Game Pack", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/08/family-game-pack", "text": "This is a really bad game.   Gameplay The gameplay is bad. In solitaire, it is hard to move the cards. In multiplayer, you can only play Blackjack or board games, and even then Dominoes is out because players would see each other's hand. The game does not allow multiplayer in the slots or video poker game, so families will have to play these independently and then write the scores down on paper. Two players cannot play hearts on the same team because... there is no why.  Graphics The graphics are bad. The fonts are hard to read. The colors are dull. The graphics are blurry. The use of 3DO characters to give the game life is futile, seeing as how 3DO has very little character. The load time makes all of this even more ludicrous.   Sound The sound is not bad. But, really, what's the point?  Do not buy this! I wish I was kidding here. We promise you that this review is not aimed at the hard-core gamer--  this game will frustrate any person of any age who tries to play it. Even if you want a simple game for the whole family to play, find another way. I can understand wanting a budget game to play when you're bored or with your children, but PC freebies are many times more fun than this disc. A game of Solitaire is harder to play here than with a deck of cards, and the same goes for every other game. This is the worst game I have ever played on the system, and that is saying something.", "date": "Mar 8, 2000"}
