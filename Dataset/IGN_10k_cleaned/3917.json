Slowly I move up through the field, squeezing underneath one car, drifting high and taking the next up high.  The spotter keeps up a steady stream of ~Stormtrooper talk~ (~Psssht, Car #41 is down low Psssht....still there....Psshhht, He's still there...Psssht, you're clear! Great job! There's one.  Set for Stun!~).   Okay, I was just kidding about that stun part!  Then I realize just who I was dealing with in car #41, the Target car of Casey Mears.  For some reason, he's really got it in for me.  He cuts me off, forcing a wheel down below the white line.  The car bobbles and the car tries to wag its tail happily.  I fight hard, bump into Casey, and feel a thump in the wheel as he insists that no, this is his spot I'm trying to squeeze into.  Feeling the red mist descending upon me, I drag race him towards the next turn, outbraking him low.  The car starts to slide up high because I've entered too fast.  ~Car #41 is high!~, yells the spotter.  I know that!  I'm trying like mad to hold the car low while it bleeds off more speed.  The red nose of that #41 car starts to ease ahead on the outside as I hang onto the car, the sound of my worn tires slipping on the asphalt tells me never to do that again.  I hold the car low...barely.  There's a bump again as Casey informs me that he's not going to move any further up the track to make room.  Fortunately, the low line is the fast one and he starts falling back to my right.  Finally.  I'm clear of him.  I contemplate giving him the one-finger wave as I drive off.  The spotter crows ~That was textbook pass!~.  He sounds pretty happy for a guy whose driver has just moved up to 35th place....   Yes, it is NASCAR time again, kids.  EA Sports, now the sole surviving Superpower of video game stock car racing, takes the wraps off of its shiny stock car racing title.  I can already hear some people yawning, you know the people who won't play a racing title unless your car has machine guns?  But for the stock car fan following, the hardcore sim racing fans, and even a fair number of real NASCAR drivers, EA, through it's F1 developer ImageSpace, has promised to deliver their most realistic racing title yet.     Of course, it almost goes without saying that the ghost of dearly departed Sierra/Papyrus still haunts EA as it tries to convince the armchair racer that it is now time to put Sierra's titles in the rear view mirror and look to the future.  Last year, EA didn't really pull that trick off, in spite of a game that showed a lot of promise.  This year, with the able assistance of some ex-Papyrus employees, a solid ImageSpace programming team, and even a program manager imported from Europe, where he worked on EA's final F1 title (*sniffle*).  Together, they have managed to do a fair amount more than they had last year, including adding some features that in many ways made last year's console versions more compelling than its PC counterpart, while still improving the underlying physics model that simulates the fury of stock car racing.   The first thing I saw upon booting up the game was that PC owners now have their very own career mode.  You can now create your own team, manage your budget, buy and repair cars, earn prize money and be the team owner, manager, crew chief and driver. Of course, you don't get the best cars in the world to start with.  You'll have to earn money and gain experience to upgrade your car and make it a front-runner.  Although the review cycle for the game is too short for me to have spent a great deal of time running the career system, I ran it long enough to see that it really does act like last year's console version of the same feature, albeit in full simulation mode.    Then it was time to hit the track.  As usual, all I could do was take a potshot at guessing what the competitive AI time would be, and I allowed a ~few~ driver's aids to stay on so I wouldn't do anything too hilariously stupid on cold tires.  I then hopped to, you guessed it, Daytona.  I soon regretted my eagerness.  Even though I could plant my foot on the throttle all the way around, going around turns 3 and 4, holding the car down close to the line, it suddenly pushes up towards the wall.  I tighten the turn while fighting the urge to lift out of the throttle, and drag the car around back down towards the bottom of the track, then let it drift back up.  What the...?  I don't remember Daytona doing that.  Well, I had just inadvertently discovered what we'll call a ~friendly disagreement~ with the product manager at EA about this turn.  Daytona has a tunnel there, going under the track, and as a result, there's a nice bump there.  I actually remember it from the Petty ride-along I did when visiting the track.  Of course, I don't remember it making the track feel like the curve suddenly got tighter.  Okay, whatever, I'll compensate for it.  Let's race!   Going into the turns at Daytona with 42 of my closest friends around me was a lot more hair raising.  As the banking came on, the car felt like it was slipping to the outside and I couldn't get it low fast enough.  I bumped, I slid, I spun, I hit Escape.  Hm, maybe Daytona is not the place to start this review.   The next several days I spent time at a variety of other tracks, passing and being passed, tweaking the car setup, and generally exploring the game.   The ~Daytona-pinch~ (as I'll now call it), didn't occur at any other tracks I tried.  The curves felt right and the car felt lively through the force feedback steering wheel.  Sloppy driving can make the car squirrelly in a very nauseating way, but drive hard and smooth, and the game rewards it nicely.  I felt that I could truly concentrate on the racing, and not just worrying about making some small, tiny little error that would crash me out of the race.  The AI cars, on the whole, were fun to race against.  Some of them can't seem to get their cars low in the corners to save themselves, and it's fairly easy to slip inside of them.  Other cars would pull down right in front of me if I left them even an inch of room to do it.  There was the expected bumping and grinding, and thankfully at the Pro level it wasn't enough to cause me to do unintentional smoke donuts down the back straight.     Then I got together with one of the ISI guys online.  Once we established a connection via the integrated Gamespy Arcade software, the race was buttery smooth.  Regrettably, we could not add AI cars to the mix, so it was just the two of us, but since both of us had broadband, I could easily and safely follow right on his tail at 180mph all the way around the track.  I'm looking forward to seeing how the bandwidth throttling holds up with more players, as the F1 titles, in the past, have really fallen off as players were added.  This is an area ImageSpace has worked on, and it shows in their F1, and now their NASCAR PC titles.   If you've read the ads that talk about ~Race the pack, not the track~, they are not really aimed at the PC version.  There are no apparent ~allies~ or ~enemies~ on the track.  It's a pretty straightforward sim from that standpoint.  So while you definitely feel like you spend more time racing the pack, the driving is not something you can just ignore.   The audio is only okay, though.  The engine still sounds very synthetic to me.  After having done a few laps in a Petty car at Orlando for comparison, I didn't really feel like the engine sounds were all that comparable.   Perhaps if I wore a helmet at my computer...?  Tire screech, so prominent in Sierra's titles, is very muffled here.  This is both good and bad.  Good because in real life I don't remember really hearing tire screech cornering hard; Bad because in real life I didn't need to hear it.  I could feel it!  Here I turned down the engine volume and upped the effects volume, but it still didn't give me as much as I'd have liked to have.    The spotter gets a failing grade entirely.  He's got a 1 second or more delay in almost every call.  By the time he tells you you're clear, you can see the car you just cleared in your mirror about 3 car lengths back.  It's amusing to hear him call a car low right after I move down and bump into said car.  Part of the problem is that the spotter insists upon embellishing by giving me the other guy's car number.  I honestly could not care less at that point.  All cars are capable of wrecking me if we hit each other!  Also, they have a long vox-like static sound before and after each call, further delaying whatever he's saying.  A simple ~Still there, Still there. Clear~ would have sufficed.  EA got too fancy with the spotter, and now I'm tempted to just turn him off entirely.   Other audio information is late or doesn't show up at all.  I had to go through the pits twice before I finally heard what the pit lane speed limit was on the third try.  It's a good thing I was estimating low on the prior two stops, but a bummer that I was giving up 10mph I shouldn't have.     The animated pit crews are decent, although from your in-car, looking in the mirror shows me a guy pouring a can of gas into thin air, because the mirror detail on my machine is not set to show the spoiler!     A bunch of function keys provide Sierra-style information, including a real-time standings board, a stopwatch of your current, last and best lap, fuel remaining, laps left, tire temperatures, tire wear, and a list of changes you want on your next pit stop.  A few things are missing, however.  The first is that you don't get to see a running situation report showing you how your relative gaps to the car ahead and behind.  I would love to have that at least once a lap at the start finish line, so I know if I'm gaining or losing compared to my immediate opposition.     Force Feedback similarly didn't really thrill me this year.  Again, having tried out the Orlando WDW Speedway track at the Petty Driving School, you can really feel the force building as you pull more lateral G's in the car.  The first few laps behind the instructor it was a piece of cake to hold the car low in the middle of the corner.  As we began to go faster, it actually started getting to the point where the car was resisting my efforts to hold it down there, and although it didn't require more wheel lock, it did require more pressure.  The Force Feedback in this title, as it ships, seems more interested in providing bump feedback from other cars and from the road, than it does on improving the feel of the grip level of the car.  I've heard from EA that the Force Feedback, like so much else in the game, is actually tunable by interested hacker-types, so perhaps the Internet racing community will answer my prayers on this one.   Graphically, there are many small touches that amount to a nice improvement over last year.  The background scenery outside of the track looks better (as you'll see in the screenshots from Daytona).  The shadows from the track signs look quite nice, and the sky looks more photographic.  The cars themselves don't look that much better than last year, but so much depends upon what details you turn on and off to get the desired frame rate.  Your mileage will vary so much in this regard that it's very hard to give the game a single ~score~ for graphics.  With high-end hardware, the game looks dynamite, but in the middle of the hardware curve, you'll have to pick and choose what is important to you to keep that frame rate high.   The implementation of the various NASCAR rules seems well implemented and up to date.  However, in the races I ran, I didn't quite buy into some of what I was seeing.  In one case, the same car caused three successive yellow flags, all right as the field went green and crossed the start/finish line.  The AI can also similarly experience brain fade.  I watched one car drive into and under the back of another car during a yellow where everyone should have been slowly circling the track (see the Tide car spun sideways in front of me in the screenshots).  In fact, in that incident, not only did I have to hop out of the throttle to avoid an incident, but I then got a warning from race control that I was going too slow!  So, can we all say ~patch needed~ ?  Yes, I'm sure EA will be gathering reports like this and we're bound to see a few patches this year to iron out the occasional wrinkle.    Nonetheless, it doesn't take away from the fact that the physics model and driving feel have substantially improved over last year.  The setup options are as in-depth as Sierra's ever were, and it's just a lot of fun to go pack racing with a full field of stock cars.   Is the game good for someone who is not hardcore?  I'd have to say yes.  The various levels of driving aids will stabilize the car and make it much easier to drive and much harder to wipe out.  This, along with the ability to set an AI difficulty percentage and run a complete career mode, means that if your interest is at all there, the game will happily come down to whatever level you're on.  The only downside is that you can expect to do some experimentation to find that sweet spot where the game is just challenging enough, and not too easy or too hard.Now about that Papyrus game that we still have out there...Did EA finally produce a product worth shelving that game for?  I won't go that far.  Not yet.  It's definitely better in almost every way than it was last year, but there are still AI issues to work out, the need to support large fields online, including AI drivers where desired, better force feedback and a re-vamped audio.  All that said, the actual driving is getting quite good and believable, and dicing with the other cars feels just right.  I would say that if EA can patch some of the AI holes and get the spotter calling the race in real-time, it becomes a photo finish on the track.  Online will probably require another year or two.  EA does have another magic bullet, of course, which is the degree of customization that ISI's games allow.  The third party community has already turned the F1 title into an incredibly realistic and beautiful GT sportscar simulation and I'm told that all the customizability of that title is also in the NASCAR titles.  EA has given us not only a fine racing simulation, but a racing construction set, so the game we are all playing in a few months might end up to be a perfected version of what EA shipped.  Who knows?I should mention that EA had me out to see their work first hand at their Florida Tiburon facility, and put me in a behind the wheel of a ~Richard Petty Driving Experience~ EA Sports car for a few laps of ~go fast, turn left~ in real life.  It's definitely a mark of bravery and confidence for EA to put an often critical racing reviewer behind the seat of a real car, with full knowledge that he would be in a better position to be critical of their title afterwards.  Throughout my visit, the team listened carefully to my suggestions and gripes from last year's titles, and showed me exactly how they were setting out to address them, refreshingly avoiding ~marketing spin~, instead concentrating on the meat and potatoes of what makes a racing sim work.  Although EA is having to fill big shoes in replacing Papyrus as the auto-racing simulator superpower, I definitely left feeling that they take this responsibility quite seriously, and it shows in the steady improvement in their PC sims from one year to the next.", "date": "Sep 17, 2003"}
