We're not sure what brought on this brilliant revelation so late in the ball game, although we know that Sony held the game held up for some time. Also, considering that the PC game's sequel, Rogue Spear is already out, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. In any case, we sort of wish that they hadn't even bothered making the PlayStation port, as it has nothing on the original. Not only did they cut up the gameplay elements, but the graphics and basic controls are so mind numbingly bad that I feel somewhat less intelligent after having played it.   Gameplay The game starts off with a standard fare PlayStation FMV detailing the storyline -- The sequence, in its entirety, isn't particularly engrossing. It takes its merry ol' time telling the story, but to put it simply, there's a lot of terrorists out there up to no good, and, as the crack team of anti-terrorist dudes calling themselves Rainbow, it's your job to kick some bad guy @ss. Your travels will find you vying for victory over foes in locales all across the globe, but, strangely enough, most of the play areas look the same. The mission outlines vary quite a lot, but the meat of the gameplay always comes down to two basic themes: Hostage rescue and search & destroy. Hostage rescue is what you'll be doing most of the time, and, to put it in twentieth century terms that ya'll understand, it can be quite a bitch.   In the PC version, the hostage situations became quite tedious, particularly later on in the game -- The split second precision and ruthless marksmanship required to pull off rescue operations really pushed the limits (as well as the patience) of many a gamer. Unfortunately for PlayStation-philes, this dilemma is worsened with the coming of the PlayStation port, as the shoddy controls make fine-aiming very difficult, especially when in a hurry. Heck, one time I had a terrorist right in front of me, in practically point blank range, and it still took me several shots to hit him. That's definitely problematic.   For most people, especially those who play first person shooters on their computers, a mouse/keyboard combination is the only way to fly. Obviously, all console FPS have this working against them from the get-go, but some handle it better than others. Unfortunately, Rainbow Six, no matter how you configure the controller settings, just isn't easy to play on the PlayStation. Even if it's just a matter of personal adjustment, by the time you've adjusted, you won't want to play the game anymore. The default setting with the Dual Shock controller employs both analog sticks, with the left moving and strafing, and the right moving your view. This setup seems nice on paper, but with all things considered, it doesn't work very well during gameplay. The Dual Shock analog sticks aren't extremely well suited for precise aiming in the first place, but what makes it even more difficult are the inconsistent framerates.   There are a number of other annoyances and problems present in the PlayStation version. First of all, when you play, the character just doesn't seem to ~fit~ in the environments too well. You get stuck in door frames, you must sometimes crawl to get through large openings, and doors don't want to open toward you unless you walk several steps away from them. What is up with that? We're chalking that up to bad programming. Pretty sad.   Furthermore, two of the most entertaining game aspects present in the PC version aren't included in the PSX port. First, you can no longer plan out your missions manually. This loss is felt more deeply by some than others, as some people found it as merely tedious and troublesome. But to many, it greatly enhanced the gameplay by adding a huge strategy element and making the accomplishment of your goals much more rewarding.   Another one of the finer aspects of the PC original was the Internet multiplayer mode. Obviously, this isn't possible on the PlayStation -- But they could have at least thrown us in some split screen action. I truly don't think that's too much to ask.   Graphics Visually, Rainbow Six is an absolute joke. We're not sure what went wrong, or just who was smoking the funny pipes during the development process, but the visual quality is laughably bad. We're talking worse than many first generation PlayStation efforts. Not only are the graphics pixelated and soupy looking, but the framerate is down the tubes. There ain't no call for that where I come from.    Aside from the visual mess that makes up your surroundings, all of the humans in the game are atrociously modeled. We're talking super deformity. Perhaps the people handling the port were so high on the funky crack rocks that their perception of ~normal looking human~ was drastically changed. In any case, Rainbow Six for PlayStation seems to link ~nicely~ with ~pixelated mess,~ ~pea soup,~ and ~freaks in pixelated pea soup land.~   Sound There's not a whole lot to be said for the sound scheme of Rainbow Six. The music is quaintly understated, if quite sparse, and the sound effects are your basic military fare. The guns sound like they should, as do the various other pieces of weaponry. There's also the occasional mid-mission speech, with verbal flourishes ranging from ~Got him!~ to the now-famous ~Tango Down!~  Overall, Rainbow Six for the PlayStation is a mighty fine example for impressionable young developers of how not to handle a port. This game is put together so poorly that it really seems as if the developers didn't even care. Even without comparing the game to the PC version, this first-person shooter is difficult, clumsy, and not comparable to Quake II or Medal of Honor, the two best FPS on the system, in any way. If you really want to play Rainbow Six in its truest form, buy the original PC version -- Or, better yet, buy Rogue Spear. It's very similar to Rainbow Six, but adds a bit more diversity. In any case, don't reward Rebellion and Red Storm for their lack of passion and virtually absent quality control with your hard-earned simoleons.", "date": "Jan 4, 2000"}
