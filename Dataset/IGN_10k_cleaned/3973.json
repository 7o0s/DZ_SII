{"name": "NBA Jam", "name_review": "NBA Jam", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/02/nba-jam", "text": "Back in the day, NBA Jam was a groundbreaking game. It brought arcade sports and sports gaming to the mainstream and was one of those rare titles that was loved by sports freaks, game geeks, and casual gamers alike. It was two-on-two basketball where the big dunk and three-pointer ruled and playing good defense was as much about knocking your opponent on his ass as it was swatting the ball back to halfcourt.   But that was ten years ago. A lot has changed in ten years.  These days the name NBA Jam is more synonymous with the piss-poor line of home games the arcade title spawned rather than the innovative arcade game that inspired them. It has been a few years since the last Jam game, a Jam in name only, and a game so bad it nearly killed the entire series. Luckily for sports fans, the time off seemed to do the franchise, and the designers some good.  The new game shows more innovation through imitation than anything else, as it has picked up features and gameplay styles from more recent ballers like NBA Street and NBA Showtime, combining them all into one, well, Jam-packed title. Is that a good thing? The answer's both yes and no, as the gameplay style has gone back to its more simplistic roots, but in the end, it still feels like a game time passed by.  Gameplay  Like I said, think NBA Street meets NBA Showtime and you pretty much know what to expect out of Jam. The game is now three-on-three using the top talent from the NBA's past and present. This enables fans to go high into the sky with King James and watch him dunk on the likes of Bill Walton and Wilt ~The Stilt~. It also shows off some of the most insane jams, slams, and multiple alley-oops of any hoop game to grace the hardwood since, you guessed it, NBA Street and NBA Showtime. That being said, the game is also extremely simplistic, and if you can master a couple of buttons, you can master the competition. After a while, actually, after a few minutes, you will be able to run down court, flip up multiple alley-oops, and dunk all over your opponents like they just got out of Warrior training camp.     If a single player hits three shots in a row, you'll hear those magic words ~He's on fire!~ Once you've been engulfed with the hotness, you will be juiced with unlimited turbo, all of your player's stats will be boosted to the max, you can goaltend shots at will without penalty. This super-power lasts for up to 60 seconds or until either you make five shots, or your opponent makes one. Another offensive weapon at your disposal is the new Jam meter. Once the meter is filled, you will then be able to do a super stunt dunk from your player's hot spot on the floor that's worth big points both on and off the court. These are some crazy slams that send players like Kobe and T-Mac spinning wildly through the air like they just got shot out of a cannon. Dunk once and earn three game points and one Jam point that you will later be able to redeem in the Jam store. Earn the hot spot again to perform another dunk, and your next slam will be worth four game points and two Jam points, and so on and so forth. After the game, head to the Jam store to spend those points on everything from retro arenas and outdoor courts to special apparel to gear up your players.  You can play in a variety of modes, from simple Exhibition games to the NBA Jam Tournament, to even a Legends Tournament that starts you off in black and white and makes you earn the right to play in color as you try to work your way up to present day. Each legendary team you beat is then unlocked for play in the other modes, enabling you to take to the courts as everyone from ~Iceman~ George Gervin to Larry Legend.      If playing as the real players, young or old, doesn't appeal to you, you can create your own baller, hook him up with some attribute points, and turn him into the type of player you always wished you could be. To top it off, you can choose to expand the NBA with an entirely new team like the Funkytown Funk or the Westminster Dawgs, and then pick the players from around the league who you want to play with. The only problem is, it takes a crazy number of Jam points to get the players you'll want, so you're going to have to go get your game-on big-time before even thinking about building a winner from scratch.  Unfortunately, while a lot of the features sound cool, and are to some degree, it's the gameplay that's really lacking in any substance beyond a five-minute playthrough. The gameplay blazes up and down the court at a lightning pace, but it's too fast to develop any type of strategy. Every game turns into the obligatory dunk or alley oop followed closely by another dunk followed again by, you guessed it, another dunk. That seems to be the main difference between Jam's gameplay and NBA Street. In Street, the ballers D you up, and you actually need to pass the rock around to find good shots or you're going home a loser. In Jam, the only strategy is to decide where to take off for the next monster dunk. A repetitive flaw that turns the game boring after a few runs, especially against the computer. As a multi-player game, at least your buddy can play defense, but the pace of the game dictates that the offense rules the floor, and every game turns into one big dunkathon.   Graphics  Not much time was spent trying to make the players look like their real-life counterparts beyond bald players are bald, blonde players are blonde, and the old-school guys have afros. Sure there's a resemblance, but compared to all of the other basketball games on the market, the graphics shoot an air ball, especially considering there are less players on the floor than a regular game, so each character could've been detailed to a higher degree. The players also sport a slightly bigger head than average, giving the game a goofy look, unless maybe if you're into this whole bobble head phenomenon.   Sound  The original voice of NBA Jam is back, as Tim Kitzrow announces all the slams, jams, and three-point shots with the flare and style that made his voice so memorable to gamers back in the arcade with quotes like ~He's doing it, doing it, and doing it well.~ Unfortunately, he also says things like ~Van Exel releases a three, he goes for three!~ Meanwhile the other team is already dribbling the ball up the other end of the floor.    I spent a small fortune playing NBA Jam at arcades, and while Im glad to see the game return to its action-oriented roots, other games have taken the formula and advanced it to such a degree, the NBA Jam just cant compete at the game it originated. The game is fun for a while, and definitely worth a rental if youre going to play against some friends, but if ever a game and its weak AI called for online play, it was this one. Imagine a game that you could play three on three, six human players, all online slamming, pushing, and scrambling for the ball. Unfortunately, youll have to leave it to your imagination as online play is not in the game, but its the kind of thing that couldve elevated the game up to the competition instead of just trying to copy them.", "date": "Oct 2, 2003"}
