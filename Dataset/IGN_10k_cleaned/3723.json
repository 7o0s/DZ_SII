I'd save my money for weeks, hoping to amass enough to buy a new spaceship for my action figures or a cheap-o skateboard at K-Mart. Putting that twenty dollars down on the counter represented accomplishment, sacrifice and discipline. Therefore, I can remember a lot of my hard-earned purchases from my childhood until this day.  Times have changed. Now twenty dollars barely gets me into a club, or buys dinner, or fills the car with gas. In short, twenty dollars is no longer twenty dollars. So when a game like Evil Dead: Fistful of Boomstick ships, and it costs twenty dollars, it makes me take note. A whole game for twenty bills? Sign me up! But then I start thinking, ~Why is this game only twenty bucks?~   I was confronted with this conundrum in light of THQ's Evil Dead: Fistful of Boomstick. It's good that the game was released at this price point, because it can't be recommended at $50. But for twenty, sure. Developed by VIS, the team behind the frustrating but sometimes fun State of Emergency. Evil Dead uses the engine to create a straightforward adventure game that's heavy on the zombie carnage. It doesn't pretend to be a deep game, and that's good. This game is the equivalent of the series it's based on-- a tongue-in-cheek experience that's designed to give you a chuckle and satisfy your more visceral needs (like wasting the undead). And that's all.   Fans of the movies will get into the game simply because Bruce Campbell's constant dialogue infuses the action with enough personality to separate it from the other action titles. Straight-up action fans might get bored with the game halfway through, but after all, the game costs half as much.  Gameplay  It's nice to see that games are starting to move away from the formula of basing their games directly on specific movies. Like Enter the Matrix, Evil Dead utilizes the license to tell a story about Ash and the Deadites that doesn't exist in any of the movies. For fans of the campy horror films, the story is instantly recognizable, but it's delivered in the signature style of Bruce Campbell.   Evil Dead shows its roots in State of Emergency. Movement feels pretty much the same, as does the fighting. But where SOE fails, Fistful of Boomstick succeeds. The story mode in this game does something that SOE never did tell a story. It's not necessarily a great story, but it's interesting enough to keep you playing. The game is punctuated by cut scenes, most of which are decent, but one annoying feature is that not all of them are skippable. This becomes tiresome when you keep dying at a boss fight, and have to sit through the same FMV each time you face him.  Still, the actual gameplay is fun, if a little repetitive. Mainly, the goal is to find keys, open doors and keep moving. In between, you'll have to dispatch hundreds of undead. Luckily, the key weapons from the movie are here in spades. You've got the chainsaw (an absolute must), as well as a shotgun and pistol. The shotgun and pistol can carry different kinds of ammo, like incendiary rounds, or piercing bullets, that will kill your targets quicker. In addition to the guns, there are grenades and some other goodies. I was impressed by the amount of weapon choices in the game, and almost all of them (including the shovel) were enjoyable to wield.  To add even more attack options, you can also cast spells in the game. There are a variety of these as well. In addition to super strength and a lightning attack, there is a super-cool possess spell that allows you to take control of a Deadite or zombie dog. The effect that precedes the possession is the crazy flying follow-cam that is found in every movie in the trilogy. Details like this-- that hearken back to the source material-- are nice touches, and why folks should pick the game up if they're big fans.  As you play and beat the story mode levels, you will unlock new arcade levels. These levels are moderately enjoyable, as they allow you to face a set of challenges, most of which involve killing a number of zombies in a set amount of time. They add a little more value to the package, which is already pretty attractive at its price point.  Graphics  There's really not much to say about the graphics. They definitely don't come close to pushing the limits of the Xbox hardware. In fact, at times, they look downright bad. The textures are plain and a tad pixilated, the character models are pretty standard (with the exception of Ash, who looks pretty good), and the effects are good, but nothing special.  The main problem with the graphics is that they start to blend together, level to level. Many of the areas look the same, and there isn't a lot of differentiation between buildings, streets, etc. In addition, the palette is boring full of grays and greens that smear together.  The camera does an okay job of keeping up with the action, but also affords you the opportunity to swing it around with the right analog stick, or snap behind you. Manually controlling the camera is definitely necessary in some situations, so if you're the type of gamer who doesn't like to babysit the point-of-view, you may be frustrated by Boomstick.  Sound  The superstar of the sound department is Bruce Campbell, who lends his voice to the main character, Ash. This game wouldn't have been nearly as fun if it didn't have Campbell onboard, simply because his deadpan delivery of lines is perfect.   Another good thing in the realm of sound is the music. It swells whenever a threat approaches, so the music (as in a horror film) is dynamic and actually helps the experience of the game. The melodies are straight out of a horror film (think frantic), and build the sense of urgency and danger.  The sound effects are decent as well, if sparse. Weapon sounds are adequate, and ambient noises are good, but the sound samples do get repetitive after a while.  I'm surprised more companies don't release games for $20. At $20, more people will take a chance on it and be rewarded. The game isn't bad. In fact, it's fun, mainly due to the chainsaw and shotgun action. The one-liners themselves are worth at least a rental. It isn't the most technically stunning game you'll ever see, but it does have Bruce Campbell and a brand new storyline within the world of Evil Dead. Those burned by Hail to the King, give this one a try. It's a lot better. Fans should pick it up for $20, and everyone else should probably rent it.", "date": "Jun 17, 2003"}
