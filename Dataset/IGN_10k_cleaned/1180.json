Truthfully, they were a step down on the ~dude, that's freakin' cool~ hierarchy from GI Joes, but who's keeping score?  For the record, those cordless cars were also expensive as hell, or rather they were from a broke as a joke ten-year-old's standpoint.  Pitiful as it seems in retrospect, my Radio Shack Made-in-Kuala-Lumpur-mobiles couldn't hang with the rich kids' toys.  Like many youngsters, I had to find solace in Nintendo's all-time classic RC Pro Am.  Spare me the game geek ridicule, however.  The sympathetic folks at Sierra just proved that I wasn't the only poorly funded goob on the block.    After that, ahem, wonderful buildup (also known as ~filler~ or ~padding~), we're proud to introduce RC Racers Deluxe: Traxxas Edition.  An unapologetic 2D/3D overhead view arcade racer, this is as close an Honest-to-God, Amiga-style title as you'll find since, oh, 1994 or so.  Granted, that's assuming you weren't part of the oddball European set who grabbed 3DO's Nitro Racers or Iridon's Excessive Speed a few years back.    Let's make a long story short, shall we?  RCR's your basic ~car meets track, car spews a nuclear missile up competitor's tushie, car roars on to fame and glory~ tale. Normally, this would be the point where one stops reading the current review and moves on to coverage of Sacrifice, Black and White, or some other multi-bazillion dollar product.  But freeze right there, little buddy, because if you click off into oblivion, you'll miss out on hearing about one of the best twitch n' go games of the year.  Humble as the advertising budget for this sucker was, RC Racers Deluxe is an intoxicating cocktail of intense racing and comic relief.  Quick shots of adrenaline are administered through one-time exhibition runs against AI controlled cars.  Long term goodness lurks in the guise of Circuit mode, which prompts players to move onward through a series of competitions earning cash & points, upgrading vehicles as they go.  The idea is to ace out the competition; whether this is accomplished through speed, bumper car tactics or special weapons is irrelevant.  Friends can also tangle with one another in same computer, split-screen races or one driver can have at it against the computer in rounds of Soccer or Battle Ball.  These goofball, sports-oriented contests put a lone driver or team in control one or more colored balls in the hopes they'll successfully use them to score goals against a lone rival or group of foes.  Smarty-pants gamers have no doubt figured out by now that the theme and absence of next generation technology aren't much of a hook.  Gameplay's the reigning champ on this disc, as evidenced by the fact that the jaded, impatient dweeb talking to you clocked in several hours with RC Racers Deluxe on the first sitting.  Although the controls are extremely loose, requiring a lengthy spell behind the wheel to become accustomed to, there's little not to love about this bad boy.  From firecrackers, homing rockets, and oil slicks to bomb-tossing lawn gnomes...it's all gravy, baby.  First, take into account the simplistic control scheme, consisting solely of directional pad arrows plus a key or two for turbo boosts and weapons.  Next, consider the 16 tracks themselves, each of which bears a creative theme (Aztec, Haunted, Backyard, Hillbilly Hill, etc.).  Sittin' there looking so gosh durned pretty, you wouldn't anticipate that they're boiling over with nasty surprises ranging from killer chickens that'll peck a car to pieces to PO'd cobras or water puddles that cause an auto's circuitry to go haywire. Plus, you've got to dig the nifty upgrade system, whereby parts like the motor, shocks and tires can be enhanced for a tidy sum.  Mr. Magic 8-Ball states chances are favorable that Sierra's production team tapped into some top-notch artistic talent too.  Auto models (monster truck, baja bug, Traxxas stadium truck, Traxxas bandit buggy) were crafted from juicy lookin' 3D textures, then placed over gorgeous 2D environments such as frog ponds, construction sites and indoor arenas.  Paint jobs can be chosen from a set of six default choices or edited to custom specifications.  While the camera angle tracks the action, it doesn't shift, although roadsters grow or decrease in size relative to their onscreen position (i.e. when moving towards the monitor they appear larger).  A remarkable library of terrain sets, including gravel, rubble, logs, and dirt noticeably affect vehicle performance, as does elevation.  Rounding out the presentation are the semi-decent animations through which flora and fauna are brought to life.    The audio effects are barely worth mentioning, since heavily recycled smash, crash, grind, zap and boom noises blend instantly into the overall din.  Color commentary quality's great in standard play modes (~Oh man, he took one up the tailpipe!~), yet totally overdone during soccer or battle ball matches.  Luckily, thanks to verbal jabs and constant noise, the title's musical deficiency isn't an earth shattering let down.  Words don't really do justice to the experience; you've gotta play this one to understand what makes it a justifiable purchase.  Fashionably late as far as trends go, RC Racers Deluxe is an excellent title that the whole family will go head over heels for.  Internet support and more vicious weaponry would've clinched an endorsement for the hardcore gaming crowd as well, though 'twas not destined to be.  Still, this sucker's more fun than the genuine item, and a whole lot cheaper to replace when little Billy smashes it to bits too.  -- Scott Steinberg      Want to share your opinions with the world? Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  or send some mail to IGNPC about this story.  RC racing was always one of my most cherished childhood hobbies, so the prospect of reliving the experience on PlayStation was exciting to say the least. While I found that Team Losi RC Racer did do an excellent job of recreating the feel of driving the miniature off-road cars, it's significantly hampered by technical shortcomings, and proved rather dull in the end.Severe frame-rate inconsistencies interfered with gameplay more often than not (especially in the two-player mode) and the equally bad pop-up was very distracting. And while it was fun to drive the realistically controlling cars around the first few tracks, it became monotonous far too quickly.I'll give the game credit as a two-player experience; it's a good rental for when you've got a friend over. But as a single-player experience I'd have to relegate it to ~a good concept that fell short upon execution~ status. Still worth a rental if you've never played with RC racers, but serious fans will want to stick to the real deal.", "date": "Aug 22, 2000"}
