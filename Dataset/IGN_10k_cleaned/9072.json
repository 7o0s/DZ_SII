Namco Networks' new casual game checks in on Snoopy as he flies not-so-dangerous missions with his Sopwith Camel. Sure, his plane may look a lot like a big, red doghouse, but the point Peanuts creator Charles Schulz was making concerned the wonder of an imagination. So, if you still see a doghouse after reading that, you've been overrun by an overly cynical media age.   Anyway...   Snoopy doesn't engage the Red Baron in direct dogfights in Flying Ace. Instead, the game concentrates on a one-button mechanic that's geared for the ultra-casual crowd. Holding and releasing the OK button raises and lowers Snoopy's plane. Tapping it twice makes him do a loop-de-loop. The pup's mission is to collect enough red balloons in each three-stage chapter to move on to the next. The more balloons you collect, the more points you earn which can be cashed in for classic comic strip downloads. (That's very cool.)   The balloons are all over the place. Fortunately, you have a small guide along the top of the screen that shows the relative placement and altitude of the upcoming balloons so you can make the necessary adjustments. Matters are complicated by storm clouds, wind gusts, and the Red Baron's fly-bys. Snoopy can pick up mugs of his favorite drink, root beer, to increase speed. Picking up Woodstock and his friends increases Snoopy's bonuses, as does barnstorming or clipping the Peanuts gang on the ground.   This is not the first game to use this one-button mechanic. Vivendi's Flying Toaster game tried it before, for example. It's not an exceptionally deep kind of game, but married with a cool theme, it can work. Snoopy is a good fit. For Peanuts fans, it's exceptionally endearing. If you're not a Snoopy fan, though, the simple game play may leave you a little cold.Snoopy the Flying Ace is a simple, casual game geared for the legions of Peanuts fans. There are a lot of flying missions in here, giving the game some longevity. However, the coolest feature by far is the ability to download comics after earning enough points. That's the kind of added value more casual mobile games need.", "date": "Sep 21, 2007"}
