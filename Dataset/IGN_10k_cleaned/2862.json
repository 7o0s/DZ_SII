Like you, and everyone else dominated by inane masculinity or general narrow-mindedness, I saw and then immediately dismissed the game as rubbish. Tennis? Bah! I wear no skirts. I own no colorful clothing. I care not for little balls, the mastering of rackets, gentle clapping, abated whispering, or physical exercise under a baking sun. How could I be interested in an admittedly simple and arcadey title that takes all of the above and puts it on a CD? Why don't I just rollover and die?  After seeing countless glowing reviews, my fleeting willpower caved to impulse spending, and on a whim (and some Corona) I expanded my Dreamcast library with what would eventually become one of my most cherished titles.   As it turned out, nothing spelled competitive loving like Virtua Tennis. A night of Dreaming via Sega's little white wonder fueled by cheep beer and cheaper boxed wine was made glorious and special by this little gem. It acted as the perfect icing to cakes composed of NFL 2K, Power Stone, and Soul Calibur. It was the only thing to settle bets, end nights, and separate the champions from the weak and meek.    But why? At heart it was just a game of stick movement that required players to press one of two buttons -- a glorified Pong set atop green grass and glowing clay. But that was its beauty, its charm. Simplistic and deceptively addicting, Virtua Tennis relied on the purest, most primal of reflexes. Once enthralled, a person would find that all at once the animal instincts of yesteryear that had lay dormant for countless millennia resurfaced. As I slammed the ball across court to win an advantage, thus giving me ample cause to throw my controller high into the air and boast the superior size and fortitude of my genitalia over fallen foes, I might as well have been hunting the wooly mammoth or struggling over a dead pig with some kind of evil sentient half lizard monster that used to populate the Earth (kind of like what's seen in those crappy made for TV movies about people exploring really deep caves and then getting abused by said lizard monsters).    But that was Dreamcast. This is PC.   Empire Interactive has its own port of Virtua Tennis for the computing wonder that Microsoft stole (best advertising campaign ever). But savvy Brits were the only ones to receive the blessing (Europe, it seems, is not always shafted in our industry). So, it has fallen upon Strategy First, Wanadoo, Infogrames, and Carapace, in a love square of publisher, other publisher, distributor, and developer, to unsheathe the rackets, round up the balls, and let loose the power-slamming, back-hitting goodness. Can they do it? Can this, US Open 2002, be the heaven we seek?  Not really.  The official website begs to differ: ~For the casual as well as the passionate fan, US OPEN 2002 combines responsive gameplay and stunningly realistic settings.~  Not so. That assertion is right in a lot of places, but still flawed in two major areas. For one, the game is not responsive. Secondly, it's also not stunningly realistic. Other than that, everything else in that sentence is completely true. I've known both casual and passionate tennis aficionados.   Let's start with the positive. The sound is really good. Apparently sound banks from the F.T.F. were used to recreate the proper atmosphere, and the end result is noticeable. Every soft applause, roaring cheer, ball bounce, racket smack, and announcer announcement sings quality through and through.   There's also not much to complain about in terms of longevity. Internet play didn't make the cut, but LAN gaming is in full form (though it's possible to upload information to the Internet and compare it to that of other gamers). Also present are a multitude of modes and secrets waiting to be unlocked via playing the game's 10 modes and just generally advancing in what amounts to season play with a user-created character, selected from a preset amount of bodies and articles of apparel.   But, is there really a point to advance when the play lacks?   Aesthetically the game may be passable, very reminiscent of Virtua Tennis or Tennis Masters Series with little improvements (sharper courts), but even a few downsides (worse animation, always two-dimensional audiences). Control, however, is seriously flawed. What made Hitmaker's offering so enticing and addictive was that it did what it was commanded to. Rarely would ball whacks be missed as a direct fault of design. And when they were it was sheer aggravation. So what happens when a clunky game makes that happen far more often? Far more aggravation, naturally.   In US Open 2002, control is clumsy. Whether it be by joystick, gamepad, or keyboard, just moving about the court is unresponsive and sloppy. Though there may be over 500 mo-capped animations, the transitions between them are jerky and not immediate, which means slamming the control from one side to the other to reach a quickly approaching ball is often times futile, since the character will slop out from a running position and into a turning one and only then try in vain to initiate a swing, long after the ball has passed.   And that's the main, and worst problem with the game. It gets so bad at times that defeating the more difficult opponents becomes more an effort of luck than reflex, what we've established to be the most redeeming and alluring quality of Virtua Tennis. A copy that fails to copy the one thing it should have, best explains US Open.  When you destroy the reliance on reflex by inefficiently delivering it with a lot of trails (nearly every swing in this game is consisted of way too few frames of animation and way too many trails that emanate from the back of the racket), what's left is a broken game born from a killer concept, however stolen, and a decent, even admirable presentation (when compared to most of the sort).   The problem only worsens in the doubles matches, where, if you are allied with a computer opponent, you'll not only be limited by your own confounding inability to readily return close hits, but also that of your partner's, whose problem is also unfortunately compounded by general stupidity. They say the artificial intelligence was developed with the cooperation of a pro trainer, but I doubt this, unless he/she was a moron. Small hits go untouched, easy returns get passed up, and the computer generally gets confused, a lot. Unless you're playing against the harder opponents who can magically return volleys from completely off-screen (you can't even see them or the ball), the game gets real dumb, real fast.   What did you think of US Open 2002?  I'm not disputing the amount of courts, players, or modes. Nor am I disputing the level of aural or visual quality (cool to decent). But, with an imperfect, imprecise, and sometimes bad game lying slightly beneath the clean outer surface, none of the above amounts to a whole lot.  It's hard to perfect perfection, especially when you're the imitator, not the originator. Wanadoo, Strategy First, Carapace, Infogrames... Whoever the heck it was who made this game is learning this right now. Where Virtua Tennis was tight, precise, responsive, polished, and complete, US Open 2002 is clumsy, awkward, and very straightforward. It's unfortunate too. This game had great potential, at least as much as its Dreamcast inspiration did (and did deliver on). But, like many a clone throughout history, the copy always loses something of the original. Such is the case here.US Open 2002 is all of the bad parts of Virtua Tennis thrown into a fruit juicer. The pulp filled liquid that pumps from the dispenser may not be palatable, but it's still edible. Amazingly enough, that's actually acceptable, especially in as starved a market as ours, where the grand old champion of Sega ball-slinging won't ever be making its way stateside. Definitely try before you buy. US Open 2002 is only for those who simply cannot live without Virtua Tennis on the PC, and also don't mind a bit if it comes broken.", "date": "Aug 19, 2002"}
