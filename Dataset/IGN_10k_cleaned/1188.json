Sentient and City of Lost Children pale in comparison to Destruction Derby 2 and Wipeout XL. If Codename: Tenka is indicative of things to come, then Psygnosis may be back on track again.  It's your standard first-person shooter, but it succeeds fairly well for what it is. This genre has always seemed fairly limited but Tenka milks it for what it's worth. For starters, the game is completely polygonal, with 3D enemies as well as environments. No pixelated baddies here. The enemies are all pretty evil looking, if a bit strange, so you really enjoy blowing them up, if just to get them out of your face.  Thankfully, Tenka lets you aim up and down (although moving up and down is a little slow), something most PSX shooters don't allow. This has freed Psygnosis up to build multi-leveled rooms, including vents to get down and crawl through (Konami's Broken Helix also employs this to great effect). It's a nice addition to walking from room to room.  No shooter would be complete without an arsenal of great guns, and Tenka has it in spades. A laser site has also been included, which is just plain cool. In fact, Tenka has some of the most unique light sourcing we've seen on any game in quite a while.  At its heart, Tenka is a good, solid shooter. It won't knock Doom off its throne, but it is strong enough to contend.", "date": "May 27, 1997"}
