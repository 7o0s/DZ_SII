But whose slaughter? That depends on your skill at piloting, at evading kamikaze dive ships, at routing through fields full of gunfire and embattlements, and mostly at gunning your laser white-hot until every comer is a smattering of dust and pulp. Ten years ago, you had the flying skills to make whole squadrons betray their leader and turn tail out into the cosmos. But since then, the shooter gaming genre came to a peace, and the gunships retired to their hangars, seemingly forever. Starfighters became role-players, dabbling in fantasy and letting their trigger fingers grow fat and lazy.  Invaders from Planet Cephei know this, and have launched a terrible force to enslave us all. Project S-11 is our only hope. Can you prove yourself as a pilot one more time?  Features Intense space shooter combat  Eight vertical-scrolling attack stages  Five upgradable weapons for customized destruction  Overflooded screens of mayhem with zero slowdown Only for Game Boy Color    Paragon 5's incredibly intense shooter Project S-11 rips up the Game Boy Color with speed, effects, and wall-to-wall enemies like never seen before. This is the type of game the NES flickered like crazy with; the SNES chopped and slowed down with this much action on screen. But on the Game Boy Color, Project S-11 courses through massive throngs of invaders and intense eruptions of gunfire without a hitch, like this 8-bit system was made to autopilot through extreme cases. Like most modern shooters, the game has trouble finding that upper atmosphere of creativity and perfection, but what it lacks in innovation, it makes up for with a fury.   Taking pages out of Raiden Trad, Space Megaforce, and The Guardian Legend, this top-down shooter guns eight levels of programmed enemies and monstrous bosses until the final showdown with the Leader. This game's difference is that the ship can take multiple hits before exploding, but that still doesn't limit the intensity. In fact, many shooter gunners will be thanking their stars that there's a shield on this ship. The game's engine can handle forces of extreme size and tenacity, unlike most Game Boy (or even console) shooters. Prime gunners on the Genesis like Mushya kill this game, but on the weightless Game Boy hardware, there's plenty of intensity and action to do the genre proud.  The engine certainly compensates for what's lacking in the design. Enemies are simple and have no animation -- even the bosses are simple single-unit masses. Paragon 5 clearly ran up against the system's limits in the design phase, and that hurts the quality of the bosses -- you won't see gristly R-Type bosses in this game. But the variety of enemies and their patterns in the main sections is incredible -- these bugs look janky, but they're nasty as hell. Having one of these simplistic rockets and spider ships on-screen isn't impressive. Having 15 or so, all riffling off gunfire while you light up the tiny screen with your own ammo charges suddenly makes these foes look a lot more menacing. There's no slowdown ever, and only hints of flicker if you watch really carefully.   You just can't complain when the game's running like this. The backgrounds are simple like the enemies, but the design team varies them enough so that it never looks like flying over a treadmill. Building and natural landmarks sparsely spot the land. There are also some nice effects to peak the afterburners. Water effects and space warps are crisp and impressive, as are the interstitial text effects. They're somewhat homebrew effects that show off the game's R&D roots -- showy tricks that rarely turn up in polished professional games -- but space shooters are all about showing off, and the showy glam in this game fits well.  But all this bristle would be moot if the gameplay didn't fly. Project S-11 is following burnt-out paths, and though shooting is due for a comeback like G&R, there needs to be something brand spanking-new and grabbing to capture gamers. They almost didn't get nail it with Project S-11, as the game is mostly familiar. However, while the enemies and variety aren't break-throughs, the game's weapons are stellar. All guns can be powered up several times, and the strategy of the guns adds as much to the game as the effects they blast off. Many of these guns are just good versions of what we've seen before, but the Falling Flame -- where lava spews forward then falls back to make both an offensive and defensive attack -- is amongst the greatest guns I've ever heated up.    Sunsoft unfortunately had to push this one out the door. It's US office went through corporate restructuring, neared bankrupcy, and has not even been able to add this game to the company's web site -- all this left Paragon 5's work in a spin-out. If you remember, Project S-11 was involved in a contest to find a new name... Clearly, looking at the package I purchased in stores just this afternoon, that whole contest gave the producers nothing more to go on. Carrying a low price tag and kiddie box art on the cover, Project S-11 looks to be a project on the brink of having been scrapped.But it emerges, and against all odds, it succeeds. You will not believe your eyes when you see Falling Fire at full power -- it makes the Game Boy Color sing. Sure, the game is familiar -- even though Paragon 5 attempted to pretend there's a story to this shooter, they can't muster the spirit to return to it until four levels in, and even then, all you learn is that baddies need to be shot, that your planet needs to be saved, and that you're still the only hope. But who cares? This is a shooter -- one with speed, with tenacity, and with a brilliant Falling Flame. It's not the most difficult or stylish ever, but very few Game Boy Color games crank it up to 11. This game touches the dial and checks to see if maybe there's a 12.", "date": "Jan 9, 2001"}
