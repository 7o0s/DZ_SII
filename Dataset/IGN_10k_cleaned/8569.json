Out of nowhere, the UK-based developer has given us a fascinating and original puzzler that's as entertaining as it is intriguing. The game is called Crush and it's damn near awesome.    Super Paper Mario players may already be somewhat familiar with Crush's broader premise; that is, swinging between 2D and 3D perspectives as a means to complete a level. But unlike Mario, where players are restricted in how they flip their viewpoints, Crush challenges users to make use of both side-scrolling and top-down 2D angles. When combined with the game's multiple 3D views, Crush's uncomplicated goal of collecting marbles quickly morphs into an exciting challenge of mental fortitude.   The test is this: you must escape an Escher-like dream made up of blocks positioned at varying elevations and distances from each other. The only way to achieve this is to solve a riddle whose answer resides in multiple dimensions. Knowing how to properly position the camera so that you can ~Crush~ (the act of moving from 2D to 3D) at the right moment is what victory is all about. In addition to the camera's angle, the surface type on which you're standing determines what happens after each Crush. So, depending on your angle and material type, ~crushing~ can result in the creation of a platform-ladder that moves you closer to your goal, or it could activate a switch that opens up another doorway.   Buy Crush and you'll see weird stuff like this. Don't worry; this process isn't as complicated as it sounds. While there are some gameplay subtleties that have to be mastered as players move on (understanding the many uses of boulders, switches, and transparent cubes for example), none of the mechanics are too overwhelming. That's Crush's greatest achievement, actually -- there's always something new to overcome, but they're introduced at an ideal pace and most have perfectly logical solutions... you just have to think ~outside the box.~   What other game out there puts you in scenarios where you have to climb three stories of varying directions and dimensions while avoiding giant cockroaches, electrified shock panels, and some of the longest gaps between earth and space that you'll ever see? There's nothing else like it.   Another one of Crush's strengths is how it motivates you to keep playing. While its addictive puzzles would certainly be enough for most, Zo had enough foresight to include a pretty interesting storyline as well. So, as insomniac Danny, players must understand why their hero is plagued with sleepless nights. With the help of Dr. Reubens and his ~Cognitive Regression Utilizing pSychiatric Heuristics~ machine, Danny participates in a brand new type of regression therapy that allows him to traverse the blocks of his very mind. It's clever stuff.   As compelling as Crush is, it does run into a few issues that hold it back just a little. The 3D sections that require longer jumps between chasms, for instance, are bothersome because Danny's leaping mechanic isn't as precise or responsive as it should be. It's also sometimes difficult to see clearly in levels that have densely-packed blocks of varying heights, and some stages can actually take in upwards of an 30-40 minutes to complete (though there is a hint feature you can switch on if you're into cheating). There's a heavy bit of trial and error gameplay to overcome too -- a definite knock for players who like their progression a little more forward.   Then again, given what Crush brings to the table, the negatives are far outweighed by the positives.You know you've found a great puzzler when even the earliest levels in the game leave you feeling completely rewarded. Crush accomplishes this feat thanks to its 40 superbly-designed mazes, fantastic art style, and terrific original concept. There are even unlockables and trophy stages to mess around with to boot! Sure it isn't perfect, but what more do you need? It's a must-own.", "date": "Jun 1, 2007"}
