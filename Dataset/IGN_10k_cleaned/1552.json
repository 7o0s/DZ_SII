Of these, the most notable are Naughty Dog's Crash Team Racing and Funcom's Speed Punks with Eidos' Walt Disney's Magical Racing Tour being one of the biggest surprises in the genre because of its brilliant theme-park based level design. However, even with these few gems, the genre is generally looked down upon because the majority of the games don't really do anything to bring the genre beyond what we were first given in the original Mario Kart on SNES. Konami's Woody Woodpecker Racing tries to do some new and unique things, but none of it manages to bring anything new to the genre.   Gameplay  One of these new things is the introduction of several new vehicle types beyond just the regular karts. In Woody, players can race in karts, stock cars, all-terrain vehicles, and these old jalopies. The problem with it all is that none of these different vehicles really add any new play mechanics or add any extra value to the game because they're mostly just different in the visual sense, as all of the vehicles pretty much drive exactly the same.   Similarly, the game's character unique special attacks are in the same boat, as they all simply do the exact same thing with just a different visual look. For fans of the mischievous woodpecker, the attacks might be somewhat amusing because you'll get some nice visuals in the form of Woody pecking his opponents with his beak the cute little Chilly Willy slapping someone with a big fish, but it doesn't hide the fact that there's nothing really different with each attacks in terms of play mechanics. The game has nine total characters, of which three have to be opened through playing the Quest Mode, and none of them really offer anything different from the others.   While just having the Woody characters might be enough to please diehard fans of the bird, most will likely get turned off by the fact that the game is frustratingly difficult. Even when playing the game on the Easy level, the game is far from easy. Even if you're running a perfect race and in the lead, it's quite common to find yourself sent from first to last near the end of the race because a competitor had just zoomed up to you and hit you with a side attack before you even noticed them get there. Getting hit by attacks, which generally send you flying and spinning straight up in the air, just happens way too much and becomes very frustrating very quickly. The game might have a kiddie license, but the kiddies probably won't have much fun playing this insanely difficult title.   Graphics  As if the disappointing gameplay isn't enough, Woody Woodpecker Racing lacks any visual flare that might have been able to save it from the realm of mediocrity. The game looks like an early generation PlayStation game and it's a far cry from what we've seen in other kart games like Crash Team Racing and even Speed Punks. The framerate is solid and there are some nice animations with the different characters' attacks, but there's nothing here that'll impress anyone.    Sound  The game's lone area that isn't completely disappointing is probably the audio. The sound isn't phenomenal by any means, but the game does have a nice collection of Woody voice samples and the musical soundtrack features some hip takes on the cartoon's theme song. The only real problem is that certain things, such as Woody's laugh, and some of the tunes can become very painful after a while. What's more, it can be embarrassing to find yourself humming the Woody theme song at the local mall.  There's not much to say -- unless you're a diehard Woody Woodpecker fan that just has to have everything with the woodpecker's name on it, then there's no reason for you to pick up this game. There are plenty of other kart racers on the system that are simply much more enjoyable to play.", "date": "Nov 29, 2000"}
