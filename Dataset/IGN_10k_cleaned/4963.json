(Kids weaned on Grand Theft Auto, that's who.) Millions of quarters plummeted into the bellies of these machines, as red warriors and blue wizards plowed through legions of monsters in what seemed like an endless dungeon. Come on, this was the game that put ~Green elf is about to die!~ in the video game vernacular.   Features:   25 dungeons  Collect food and portions   Digital Bridges and TKO Software have brought Gauntlet to handsets, almost completely intact. Almost. The glaring mission that we were all expecting: multiplayer. Jamming on ghosts and grunts with three other people while fighting over food and treasure was what really put this dungeon crawl over the top. Without it, Gauntlet is still an enjoyable play, but it's just not the same thing. Sigh.   However, once you get over the absence of multiplayer, you'll realize that Gauntlet is actually one of the better classic ports on handsets. The visuals are faithful to the original, right down to the models of the elf. The treasure chests still glimmer, monster generators shrink as you shoot them, and exits are still just black portals. Even better, the level design is spot-on. Mobile Gauntlet has only 25 dungeons from the arcade game, but they are instantly recognizable to fans.   You still can select between the four characters: wizard, warrior, elf, and valkyrie. Each avatar has a strength, such as the warrior's expert melee skills and the elf's speed. However, these are counterbalanced with specific weaknesses. The elf's speed comes at the expense of stamina -- it takes far more damage than the burly warrior.   As you clear out the dungeons, your health slowly dwindles away. To keep alive, you must find food. other power-ups include potions that can be used to clear away screenfuls of monsters. Finally, you have to keep your eyes open for precious keys. These are a short-supply commodity in Gauntlet, but without three players also gunning for the, the immediacy to collect as many as possible is lowered.   Gauntlet sounds really, really good. The sound effects of picking up treasure and receiving messages are completely intact. There are even a few digital sound bites from the original arcade game, such as the telltale alert that you are about to die.Gauntlet just isn't really Gauntlet without the multiplayer mode, but Digital Bridges has done an otherwise outstanding job porting this arcade classic to handsets. All of the characters are present, the dungeons are the same, and it even includes a few lines of speech. Purists may resist downloading, they'd be missing out on an great little game that will easily consume several hours of your downtime.", "date": "Sep 9, 2004"}
