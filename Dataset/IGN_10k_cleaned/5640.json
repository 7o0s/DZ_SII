Hudson Soft, the company best known for Bomberman, is chasing the genre with its own poker game; but instead of just churning out a basic Texas Hold 'Em package -- and bless them for not doing so -- they have found a fun, story-ish angle to separate it from the pack.   Now, that's not a knock against the pack. Some of the genre early entrants, such as Downtown Wireless' Downtown Texas Hold 'Em are still hot buys, but if you are going to come to the table this late in the fad, you better have some spiffy duds lest the dealer pass you by.   Hudson's gimmick, and it's not really fair to call it a gimmick, is that it sets the game in the Wild West. And we don't mean that the table is surrounded by some mid-res saloon backdrop. No, this game takes place in a high noon resort full of gunslingers, cheaters, and gentlemen that haven't seen the interior of a bath house in weeks. Rather than waste their time reconnoitering the rim, they seek their fortunes at the tables. The fact that the game coincides with not only poker's hot streak but the successful second season of ~Deadwood~ is some kind of marketing genius.   At the start of 6 Shooter Showdown: Poker, you choose a grizzled avatar to rep you in this wild frontier. Then it's time to park it at the local casino, which you actually choose from a map. At the casino, you can choose to play either Texas or Five card Draw. With your assigned number of chips, you challenge the unsavory citizens of this town.   Essentially, the casino is warm-up. The real money is to be made at the saloon, which you unlock after scoring a wagon-load of chips. The casino still has the same two games, but it adds some slick wrinkles to the proceedings. Your opponents will attempt to cheat, as well as cheat yourself. Detect one of the other players getting a little too fancy with the cards and you can draw your gun -- your choice depending on your avatar -- to punish them for conduct unbecoming of a saloon. Cheating? That is most certainly an offense worthy of turning a head into a canoe.   6 Shooter Showdown: Poker really nails the atmosphere of the Wild West. This is not the clean John Wayne version of the west, either. This is the grungy ~Wild Bunch~ and ~Deadwood~ west where men look like the rode into town from nine miles out on their own face. The in-game sprites are nicely detailed and the cards, complete with customizable backings, are easy to read. Just capital!I wasn't sure how I felt about playing yet another poker game on my cell, but 6 Shooter Showdown: Poker won my favor by serving the sport up with a sensible, but still unique, package. The developer Spidermonk (great name) not only presents two very playable card games in one package -- but they up the ante with some fun side action, like cheating and catching cheaters. If you haven't downloaded a poker game for your cell (and that's what, two people?), give 6 Shooter Showdown: Poker first-look rights. And even if you have a poker game on your handset, 6 Shooter Showdown: Poker makes a solid companion piece.", "date": "Mar 26, 2005"}
