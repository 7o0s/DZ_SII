After Racing Gears Advance you promised me more awesome games. I've been patiently waiting here for you, like a love stricken teenage girl waits by the phone. Now you've finally called back, and I've got a second date with you, in the form of Juka and the Monophonic Menace. My expectations are high, and luckily, Orbital delivers! It's just a crime I didn't have the game sooner.    Meet Juka. Don't be put off by his goofy hat, he's a lot tougher than he looks. Juka is a young alchemist that is still learning the finer points of his craft. During a visit into town, Juka discovers that many of the townspeople are missing. What's more, soldiers have started appearing all over the place, and attack anyone that they encounter. Juka goes off to investigate the disappearances, and uncovers a devious plot by an entity known as the Monophonic Menace. So Juka, with the help of his faithful pal Bufo, set off to stop this Menace and save their town.    The game is very character driven, and Juka meets a lot of interesting people (and animals) that aid him on his quest. In addition to the townsfolk that he rescues, Juka converses with other alchemists, sentient rock guardians, and a race of deerlike creatures known as Yetis. All of the characters are sharp and vibrant, and manage to convey a lot of life, even in the limited cut scenes. Even the dialogue is well done. The conversations sound like real conversations (even if Juka is conversing with a eight foot elk thing named Dwayne). There's a healthy dose of humor, but it's subtle enough that it never comes off as forced.    The world is presented in an isometric view, with lots of areas to explore. Since Juka is an alchemist, players will have to collect ingredients for his potions. Ingredients are found in plants, bodies of water, underground, and other places. There are a number of upgrades hidden through the world as well, so players will have to travel everywhere possible if they want to get everything. There's a lot to explore too. Players take Juka through meadows, cliffs, snowy mountains, ruins and a humongous castle, each one with its own dangers and delights. The levels are beautifully detailed, and well laid out. Players won't lose Juka behind a rock and get him stuck since they can't see. The levels are designed to work well with the isometric view.       As an adventure title, there isn't a lot of jumping around or running. The focus is more on the exploration and making of potions. The recipes start off easy, since Juka only has three ingredients. But as he gathers more, he'll learn new recipes to help him. The potions are used for nearly everything in the game, from battle weapons to currency. I didn't really like having to shake every tree around to get the ingredients I needed, and at the beginning the jars don't hold a lot. Later into the game players earn upgrades to their jars, and musical instruments that create the ingredients, which make things a lot less tedious. For a while there though, players have to keep going back to the local plant life or jumping into ponds so they can keep their inventory up.    There are a ton of things that Juka needs to collect while on his travels. Still, even with all the objects he's required to snag, the game never feels like a fetch quest. Everything Juka collects has a purpose. Finding lost gems pleases the talking rocks, Ruinstones, and they give you new recipes for potions. The machine parts are acquired after beating the large bosses, and are needed for the final levels. In order to get the musical instruments Juka will need, players have to complete minigame challenges. Everything has a purpose in the game, and finding those things are often fun, like in the instance of the Yeti minigames.    Juka and the Monophonic Menace may be adventure title, but there's still plenty of action. Soldiers, creatures, and machines are all out to stop Juka. Players will have to use a combination of Juka's alchemy and his sound staff to battle the various enemies. Some of the enemies, like soldiers, cannot be fought, and so players have to rely on the variety of potions they can make. Sleep potions and flash potions can help take out enemies or befuddle them enough to sneak on by. Other enemies can be attacked with Juka's sound staff. By absorbing certain attacks in a pattern, players can build up the energy in Juka's staff, then fire the stored energy at the enemies. This type of battle starts off slow in the beginning, but as more enemies are introduced, each with their own strategies, the game's pace really picks up.    The strategies players learn are combined for the bosses and minibosses scattered throughout the game. I enjoyed that each boss played a little differently from the last, so the battles never felt dull or tedious. I also liked that at the start of each boss, players were given a small instructional nudge. Not so much where players know exactly what to do and how to do it, but just enough that they can get on the right path and not get killed immediately.    Normally I'm not one to rave about any of the sounds coming from our GBAs, but Juka and the Monophonic Menace features some of the best songs anyone will find on a title for this system. A lot of the game has a sound magic element to it, so Juka will use different instruments in his travels and all of them have their own songs. In addition, the background music is charming and engaging. The songs are pleasing to listen to, which is a welcome relief on a system plagued by terrible sound.   It's been a long time coming for Juka and the Monophonic Menace, and the wait was worth it. Orbital Media has given everyone a really solid adventure game that uses some rather interesting techniques for battle. The game is geared towards a younger audience, so older players probably won't find it too challenging but then again, that never hurt a game like Pokemon, and it doesn't hurt Juka either.", "date": "Oct 31, 2006"}
