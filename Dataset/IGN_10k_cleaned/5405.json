The Blizzard classic set a new standard for strategy games five years ago and sparked an excessive number of copycats. It took a few years for real-time strategy developers to absorb the model before finally breaking through it in terms of technology and design. While some gamers still hold Starcraft up as the standard by which all other real-time strategy games are judged, none can deny that lots of new features have been introduced in the meantime.  Armies of Exigo hearkens back to the days when every RTS that came our way seemed to be cast in the Starcraft mold. Though this makes it a very traditional and ultimately unsurprising game, it also means that the developers have the benefit of five years of refinement to look back on. Consequently Armies of Exigo seems like an anachronism -- a familiar but finely polished take on the previous generation of strategy games.  Taking place after the massive war known as the Rage, the new game finds three sides competing for supremacy. The Empire, the victors in the last war, are composed of human and elven allies. Arrayed against them are the recently united tribes of beastmen, who can field a variety of savage and terrifying fighters. A new force called the Fallen is also entering the fray. Not much is known about them yet. They seem to have sprung from the shadows of the earth to make war on both beasts and men.  The actual events of the story are fairly standard but the game almost makes up for that with some really stunning cutscenes. Though the actual content of the scenes is a little conventional, the production values are first rate. The visuals have that cinematic quality that's rarely seen outside of the Blizzard brand. Unfortunately, the story here is still just typical fantasy fare.  There are twelve massive missions for each of the game's three factions. You'll definitely get your money's worth out of the campaign as many of the missions take upwards of an hour to complete. When you factor in reloads and restarts, you're talking more about a couple of hours per mission. While the quantity seems like a bargain, the missions here are just too hard. They require constant attention and allow for virtually no mistakes. Let your attention lapse for one minute and you'll be overrun and completely annihilated.  It's in part because of the mission design and the computer-brain power that manages the build order for your opponent. The enemy always seems able to come at you within the first few minutes with as big a force as he can muster. Since there's no way to issue orders while paused or adjust the game speed on the fly, you'll find yourself lagging behind the enemy AI almost immediately. It's almost as if the developers assumed that the game's difficulty equates to its potential for fun.  We've had more fun playing against other flesh-brains in the multiplayer aspect of the game. In addition to the straight one-on-one matches, the game supports team play for up to eight players as well as capture the flag and king of the hill modes. There aren't too many people out there playing the game right now so if you're considering getting it for the multiplayer, buy a copy for a friend while you're at it.   The strategies for the different sides are distinct enough to keep things interesting but equivalent enough that you can move from one to the other without too much trouble. While the Empire and Beast units are pretty similar, their distinctions in terms of supporting units is awesome. Where the humans and elves merely build houses to support more units, the Beasts raise massive beasts that not only serve as meat for armies but also act as mounts for other units. The Fallen, who are the most alien of the factions, must root their actual builders in place in order to raise the population limit. Those are some nice twists that add unique flavor to the game.  Though the Fallen are the most alien of the factions, they, along with the other two factions, will seem all too familiar to fans of real-time strategy games. They have to taint the land around them before they can build on it and focus on building massive, swarming armies of relatively weak units. The Empire faction is made up of the traditional medieval human set complete with elven archers and white-robed priests. The Beasts are a little more inventive but still field ogres, trolls, goblins and the like.  Capping groups at 15 units could potentially create a real headache in terms of controlling the armies. Armies of Exigo allows you to combine these small groups into one of four larger Super Groups. This extra layer of flexibility is definitely welcome but, given the size of the maps and the overall shape of the action, it would be much easier if the designers had just increased the unit cap for the basic groups. Keeping tabs on the status of the units within each individual group is basically impossible without lots of management      The game also makes an attempt at including formation options. In theory this would allow your melee units to stand up front with spell-casters and other ranged attackers firing from the rear ranks. While it's a good idea in theory, it tends to be kind of pointless in practice. When units move or attack, the AI of each individual unit directs its actions completely independently of the group. As a result, faster, ranged attackers will outdistance slow-moving brutes on the march. In battle each unit spreads out to find new targets on their own. The concept of formations is really only ever effective when units are unengaged and at rest.  Armies of Exigo makes its only real attempt at innovation with a dual-layered map system. Certain portals give your units access to a subterranean level where you can find more resources and alternate routes to your objectives. You can shift views between the levels with the tab key and keep track of the action on both thanks to two mini-maps. I wish the subterranean level was incorporated better into the overall game. Though the mission design sometimes forces you to go underground, Armies of Exigo ought to have tried to differentiate the below-ground experience a bit more from the action above ground.  Armies of Exigo really shines in the graphics department. Since it doesn't require the same level of 3D power as more recent RTS games, it can add much more detail to the world and improve the overall performance. The units are highly detailed here, from the traditional crossbowmen to the creepy beholders. Effects and animations are also very polished. Arrows leave little motion trails behind them and the little jabs the pikemen make are very convincing.  The world around the units and buildings is pretty engaging as well. Though you won't get great water effects or trees that blow in the breeze, you will see some nice little touches here and there. Units leave footprints in the snow for instance. When snow's not on the ground, you'll be able to see the fantastic grass textures. Things are just as detailed underground. I particularly like how the mines glow a little.  The audio isn't nearly as good as the visuals. The voice acting is pretty cliched both in terms of the performance and the dialogue. Sound effects get the job done but are otherwise uninspired. When you select certain structures, you'll hear a sound that helps identify them. While it's a nice touch, it creates problems. Some of the structures make attacking sounds when you select them and it's occasionally hard to tell whether you're actually being attacked or not.   Since it borrows so heavily from Starcraft, Armies of Exigo definitely has a lot going for it. The three races are balanced nicely and the campaign offers a lengthy challenge. Though the story is a bit forgettable, the cutscenes are almost as good as those we've seen from Blizzard.Still, this is definitely a game aimed at the hardcore, old school crowd. Newcomers to the real-time strategy genre will find that the campaign is difficult to the point of near total aggravation. I've played almost every RTS released since Starcraft and even I threw up my hands in frustration at times. Veterans who are looking for something new will find that the design holds no surprises. The dual-layer map system is a nice gimmick but I'm looking to Liquid's Dragonshard to actually make something interesting from the concept.", "date": "Dec 15, 2004"}
