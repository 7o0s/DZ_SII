It1s not really a race game, though it does involve vehicles. It1s really more of a combat game, combining the pit portions of Destruction Derby with weapons on the open road. Best yet, it succeeds.  You choose from between 12 different vehicles, everything from a motorcycle to a funked up ice cream van. Each vehicle handles accordingly and contains its own special weapons. The game moves incredibly fast, which makes for some intense, butt-whippin1 action. Unfortunately, graphics were somewhat sacrificed, but you won1t really notice as you1ll be so busy trying to kill other motorists.  The game1s only downfall is that it1s just too short. The game can be completed in just a couple of hours. However, the two-player split-screen combat mode more than makes up for the one-player mode1s lack of length. Over all, a solid game.", "date": "Nov 27, 1996"}
