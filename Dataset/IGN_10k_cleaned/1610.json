I just don't geddit  on one hand, you've got an international cast of drivers racing through complicated, exotic courses all over the globe in fantastic speed machines, and on the other hand, you've got a bunch of down-home American boys driving in circles for several hours straight. I'm so confused.  In any case, F1 racing is big in both Japan and the UK, explaining why the best  and only  F1 games come out of those regions. The latest entry in the market comes from Japan's Video System, who have kicked out a sequel to last year's F1 World Grand Prix. Unfortunately, the game follows the ~EA Model~ of using  last year's engine and updated stats, and we're not particularly big fans of that. F1 World Grand Prix II is a sim at heart, offering most of the tuning, tweaking, and true-to-life gameplay that F1 fans have come to expect. The game does feature the official F1 license, so you'll find eleven proper racing teams with the correct drivers. There are sixteen courses available, ranging from the always-familiar Suzuka circuit to the exotic streets of Monaco (and yes, the Malaysian Sepang course is included this time around). Aside from the expected single-race modes, you'll also find a championship mode that recreates the 1999 circuit, complete with accurate weather conditions. The pre-race garage lets you tweak a handful of settings, such as fuel, steering, braking, and wing angles.  The control is on-par with the first game, offering an ever-so-twitchy, sim-like feel. You'll need to be very gentle with your pad movements, and remember to counter-steer whenever possible. Most of the hard-cores who buy the game should probably set the controls to ~Realistic,~ and forget about the arcade controls entirely (they're very, very bad). As expected, the game's ~Magic Weather~ system effects the controls, and you'll need to make the proper adjustments when driving through pouring rain.  The car damage effects look authentic, too  whack into a wall, and your wheels will start wobbling back and forth; take a head-on, and kiss your front wing good-bye. You can even lose one  or both!  wheels, which has comedic results. Unfortunately, the process of accumulating damage is pretty flaky  I've survived collisions that should have sent both cars flying in different directions in multiple pieces, and the actual collision physics are laughably bad. Don't expect spectacular crashes in this one.  Other goodies include a ~Broadcast~ mode that shows off replays for each track, and a gallery feature that lets you examine each car and read up on the respective racing teams. It's a pity that the tutorial mode is so cheesy  you simply watch the CPU drive around the track, and read pop-up windows that give gameplay tips. After experiencing F355 Challenge, we couldn't help but feel let down. F1 also has major problems with AI, which exhibit near-supernatural pack mentality  if you nudge your way in front of a guy, everyone behind him will file up into a neat and orderly line, just like third-graders patiently waiting to take a slurp from the drinking fountain. While the AI is challenging enough during the actual races, certain multi-car pile-ups will result in utterly baffled computer-controlled cars.  Visually, the F1 engine is showing its limits, and I don't think there have been any noteworthy improvements since the last game. Most of the tracks do look good, and the draw-distance is impressive enough. Unfortunately, the frame rate fluctuates in a most disturbing fashion  there doesn't seem to be any ~lock~ on the frame rate, so it jumps all the way from 15 to 60fps. If you approach a section of track that's not very detailed, the frame rate skyrockets  but if the nineteen other cars are on-screen, you can hear the graphic engine start grunting in agony. The level of detail management is pretty bad, with cars ~popping~ between different detail levels right before your eyes, and the track flickers in and out in certain circumstances. The pit crew animation is also one of the worst things I have ever seen. In any case, it ain't Test Drive: Le Mans, and it looks like a first-generation game.  Musically, the game features throwaway thrash rock and unexciting techno. The engine sound effects are passable, though the British announcer has a way of getting on your nerves (~That's not a shortcut!~).  All in all, F1 World Grand Prix II is little more than last year's game with a half-assed paint job. F1 racing fans who didn't pick up the 1999 edition may feel justified in blowing their cash on the sequel, but the rest of us would be better off watching Speedvision on cable. -- Colin ~BIG GO~ Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 7, 2000"}
