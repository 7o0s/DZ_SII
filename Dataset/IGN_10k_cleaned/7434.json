Thanks to Quentin Tarantino, the fusion of pop culture references, nonlinear storytelling and violence was elevated to a new art form with the release of Reservoir Dogs.  The tale of a jewel heist gone wrong captivated moviegoers and influenced countless other films and projects.  Now, almost fifteen years later, Eidos and Volatile Games are bringing this crime drama to consoles and the PC.  But they really should've let these sleeping dogs lie instead of making this game.   While the film focused on the aftermath of the attempted robbery, it left a lot of questions up in the air for viewers to wonder about.  How did Mr. Blue die?  Where did Mr. Pink hide the stash?  When did Mr. Blonde kidnap Officer Nash?  Some of these questions are answered during the game, as Reservoir Dogs tries to give a little more of the action behind the nonlinear story.  Set across 16 chapters, you'll take on the role of the six robbers (Mr. Orange is pretty much relegated to the Prologue), as well as Nice Guy Eddie as you discover what happened when things went south.    The game alternates between two separate gameplay formats within each chapter: driving elements and third person action sequences and driving elements.  The driving sequences often involve getting from one place to the other as quickly as possible without suffering critical damage to your vehicle, causing it to explode.  You'll speed through city streets, freeways and parks, among other places, evading oncoming traffic and police officers.  Players will also gain adrenaline for high speed driving maneuvers or causing damage to nearby cars, either by shooting them or crashing into them. Once your adrenaline meter is full, you can trigger a speed boost, allowing you to accelerate to extremely high speeds.  During these moments, your car is relatively invincible to collisions with smaller and mid-size cars, which can help when your car is almost trashed.   Initially, it may seem like you'll have a variety of routes or shortcuts that you can take as you escape the police, get from one point to another or some of the other missions in the game.  However, as you play through these missions, you'll quickly realize that you're constantly crossing the exact same ground over and over again.  In fact, with the exception of some subsections of the stage or playing the level backwards, you only race around the same track. Even worse, the handling of the cars you receive in each stage is simply horrible, so even if you wind up slowing down or using your brakes and handbrakes to avoid accidents, you'll still wind up smashing into a wall, barrier or opposing traffic. You'll also find that the targeting from your guns isn't so hot as well; the aiming system waits for at least two or three seconds before it locks onto a target.  By that time, you've already passed what you're aiming for, rendering it pretty much useless.    The action sequences, by contrast, typically focus on one of the criminals as they maneuver their way through alleys, buildings and other environments. As you go through each level, you have the option to engage in crowd control tactics, halting civilians in their tracks and pre-empting them from running for alarm systems or the police. Crowd control can also be used to order people around, unlocking safes or opening gates, for example, so that you can continue along your way.  This can also be used to force law enforcement officers to drop their weapons: while the standard security guards will usually put their weapon on the ground with a simple voice command, police officers and SWAT members usually need to see a hostage beaten before they'll comply with your demands.    Of course, you're not forced to take the ~professional~ way out, as Mr. Pink would say.  Instead, you can literally shoot your way out of situations the way that Mr. Blonde would, leaving a trail of blood and bodies behind you.  Whether you choose to take out a cop or civilian, or you neutralize them so they're not a threat, you gain adrenaline in a meter, which can be used in one of two different ways: if you choose to take the violent route, you can trigger a bullet festival, Reservoir Dogs version of bullet time where you can fire a hail of bullets at any target on the screen.  On the other hand, if you have a hostage in your possession, you can trigger a signature submission, which will force any nearby people to immediately surrender regardless of who they are.   Unfortunately, the third person action sequences are full of problems as well.  For one, the crowd control tactics don't always work well. There are plenty of times that you'll demand some civilians to stand still and they won't.  Other times, you'll demand officers to put down their guns and they either won't do it, regardless of how many times you beat a hostage in front of them.  What's more, since the system is also tied to the camera control system (because that's how you'll direct characters to a wall so they can be subdued), you can easily lose sight of threats, leaving you completely open to being killed.  Finally, the system of being subdued only works at some moments, and is sometimes exploited by the police.  You may order an officer to put down his weapon, and he or she will comply for a second, only to quickly pick the gun back up and fire at you. What's the point of subduing enemies if they can disregard that command?    Along with that, there are plenty of other problems.  You can actively clear an area, either by killing or subduing police officers, and new enemies will literally spawn out of thin air behind you, getting free potshots at you.  Other officers can take close to a full clip of bullets before they die: I'm not talking about SWAT officers who appear to be packing bulletproof vests and riot shields.  I'm talking about some of the security guards and standard officers that can be hit in the chest and not go down.  Nor will they appear to suffer from the effects of tear gas or flashbang grenades that you may pick up and throw at them. Finally, you'll find that the adrenaline system doesn't work as well as you'd hope.  For one thing, you can fire a ton of bullets at one or more cops that are standing right in front of you and still wind up not killing any of them.  Sometimes this is due to this enemy ~invincibility~ problem that I mentioned before.  Other times, it appears that every single bullet that you've fired has missed its mark, regardless of how well you've aimed.  The other thing is that the signature submission system doesn't fully clear everyone on a stage.  It can be somewhat dismaying to detain two or three people, only to get capped by someone that pops up from nowhere. Issues like these make the combat sequences boring to go through.   The game also suffers from an extreme lack of replayability due to its length and lack of features. It's possible to complete the game TWICE in a 12 hour period, and while you can play the game three separate ways to unlock the different endings in the movie gallery (Psycho, Professional and Career Criminal endings) based on your actions within the game, you'll be surprised at what you unlock on a second playthrough.  For instance, I managed to receive the Career Criminal ending halfway through my second playthrough as I was trying to blow everyone away as a Psycho, which was extremely disappointing. What's more, there are only a few cheats in the game, and they don't necessarily enhance the experience any; in fact, they kind of make the game even easier than it normally is.  Speaking of normal, there's only two difficulty settings (Easy and Normal), so you'll probably wind up flying through the game once or twice and never pick it up again.  Even the art gallery concept screens of game levels that you unlock by collecting blueprints scattered through the game aren't that interesting.    Reservoir Dogs isn't the prettiest game either.  While there are some environments that are detailed, there are plenty of generic textures and character models scattered throughout the game.  Cutscenes are obviously where the majority of the visual attention was paid, although the blood effects are okay.  With the exception of Michael Madsen's character of Mr. Blonde, none of the characters look anything like the actors from the film.  The same can be said of the voice acting as well: Although Madsen returns to his role, the other voice actors don't sound like their counterparts.  The closest one is the delivery of Mr. Pink, which almost captures the manic delivery style that Steve Buscemi is known for.  Other than that, a majority of the lines spoken by hostages or police officers are dull and repetitive, and you'll often hear everything that the computerized enemies and civilians might say by the second or third chapter. At least you have the movie soundtrack to fall back on, but that isn't saying much.Movie licensed games have often gotten a bad rap -- unfortunately Reservoir Dogs is the latest one that can be added to the list.  Repetitive gameplay and limited replayability and difficulty settings are just the tip of the iceberg of a game that could've explored so much more of the characters from the movie, but just barely scratched the surface of the film.  In fact, if you're a fan of the film, you'll probably have more fun watching it over again than playing this version of the story.", "date": "Oct 25, 2006"}
