Eighteen wheels are your weapon to clear your path of pesky police and badass bikers. Steer your rig through icy slopes, desert drives, and neon illuminated cities as you visit hotspots like Smokestack Heights or Skeeter's Creek.    While touring the country side, you and your three siblings are involved in a ~Trial by Truck'n.~ Ma's sick of the ol' hauling business, so she's retiring. She can't pick which of her charming offspring is qualified to take over ~Big Mutha Truckers,~ her trucking company, so whoever can make the most money in sixty days (so that she has a nice wad o' cash to retire with) gets the business. It's up to you to use you business smarts and your sharp reflexes to show Ma who really is her favorite child.   Gameplay  Big Mutha Truckers is 2/3 arcade trucking and 1/3 economic simulation. Anyone who has played Palm Pilot games like Space Trader or Drug Wars knows the supply and demand style gameplay you can expect to find in BMT. The difference is that not only is BMT in 3D, but you actually get to drive to your destination.    Your first order of business is to pick out which of the four Jacksons you can tolerate. There isn't really a difference in tuck handling, so this decision is purely based on whose style you like the most. There's the skimpily clad Bobbie-Sue, who adorns her truck with huge kisses and has a teddy bear tied to the radiator. Cletus is the typical redneck, complete with missing teeth, ratty clothing, and a big ol' trucker's cap. Earl is the oldest of the group, and his size shows it as he rocks his rig upon entry. Rawkus is the smooth talk'n ladies man, who looks more like a Hollywood cowboy than a redneck hick.     Once you've found your Jackson, you have to choose between Trial by Truck'n or Mission Mode. Trial by Truck'n is the main game mode where you must outhaul your kin so that you can be heir to Big Mutha Truckers, Inc. You start off at BMT, Inc. with a truck full of booze and a destination picked out by Ma.     When you finally pull out of BMT, you'll get your first taste of eighteen wheeler driving. Surprisingly, you'll find the physics seem fairly realistic. Cars don't automatically go flying into the air or blow up in a cloud of flames when you hit them (that takes several hits). Instead, most of them crunch up or are thrown into spins for short distances. Your trailer also behaves as you'd expect. Any sudden movements cause the trailer to swing across lanes. Depending on the angle of your turns you can spin out and are forced to weave back and forth across the entire road as you attempt to regain control. Backing up is also slow and it's not easy to navigate. This might not qualify as a realistic simulation of big rig driving, but it replicates what you'd imagine truck driving to be like.    Besides for keeping your truck under control, while you're on the road you need only worry about four things, fuel, damage, police, and truck jackers. Your truck guzzles gas like a Hummer forced to drive up California Street in San Francisco. If you run out of gas on the road, you have to pay a fine to get towed back to your point of origin and you lose a day of travel.    Damage is taken whenever you slam into something. Depending on the angle, what part of your truck you hit, and how fast you're moving, you'll receive corresponding amounts of damage. These aren't always stationary objects that you're ramming; sometimes they're other cars, buses, trucks, or mobile homes. Whenever you hit someone and cause a significant amount of damage you're awarded money. Since your repairs are usually cheap, smash away because you'll end up making tons of cash. Just make sure your damage meter doesn't max out, because then you'll break down and be towed back to your point of origin.   While you're causing all this damage on the road, you still want to be conscious of what you're ramming into. If you hit a police cruiser, a police chase will ensue. It's fairly easy to evade the police, either drive without hitting anything for a while and you'll manage to outrun them, or you can turn the car into a burning hunk of steel. While you usually don't have problems escaping, and it's amusing to watch a cruiser dash under your trailer, if your copometer fills up then you'll be arrested and forced to pay a fine (and you lose a day).    The same rule applies to the bikers. If you happen to run over a troop of bikers that are in your way, be prepared to have your truck jacked. These rough riders will attempt to shoot out your tires, and when that fails them, they'll climb up on top of your rig in an attempt to take over the cockpit. This is more entertaining than the cop chases (unless they actually succeed in stealing your cargo) because when you violently weave through traffic, the biker gets flung across the pavement.    When you aren't on the road, you're spending the night in one of Hick State County's fine cities. You will become all too familiar with Capital City, Skeeter's Creek, Greenback, Smokestack Heights, and Salt Sea City. While it's fun to just kick back with a couple beers at the bar, you have business to do. The store is where you buy and sell your goods. The bar is a good place to pick up tips on needed commodities, win some cash in the slot machines, or borrow capital from the loan shark. At the garage, you can refuel and repair your truck, change your trailer between flatback, refrigerated, and tanker for hauling different types of cargo, purchase upgrades like better brakes and engine, spoiler, bull bars, shocks, more cargos room, and armor.    So goes the game: you pick up cargo, drive to your destination, and sell cargo, then repeat. Occasionally, this model will be broken by other drivers waging a sum of money that they can beat you in a race to a destination of your choice, or someone will hire you out for a special job that involves smashing up cars, collecting debts, destroying billboards, or running over news stands. While this, coupled with your desire to upgrade your truck, keeps things interesting for a while (aka 15 - 20 minutes), soon you'll realize that this is the entire game. Special missions are few and far between, so it's a lot of trekking over all too familiar routes.    By the time you make it to day 20, you'll be thoroughly sick of the monotonous gameplay in Trial by Truck'n. Getting to day 60 is more a trial of your patience than a test of your truck'n skills. If you decide that mission mode is what you need as a brief intermission between truck stops, you'll be sad to discover that mission mode is simply a compilation of the special missions from Trial by Truck'n.    It's not that BMT isn't fun. The fault lies mostly in the fact that there are only five places to drive to. This means that you're driving the same stretch of road over and over again. The only action that never fails to get repetitive is watching as your rig flies over hills as it descends to Sea Salt City.    It's unfortunate that the novelty of driving an 18 wheeler wears off so quickly because BMT is full of comic style. While some might find the southern stereotyping offensive, everything is over the top and shouldn't be taken seriously. While just watching the behavior of the Jacksons is humorous enough between Big Earl's slow plodding trot and his climb into his cab that looks like he'll pull over the entire rig from his weight to Cletus' drunken gait.   Each city also carries with it its own personality and brand of insult. Capital City is full of snooty, suit wearing, sales associates who mock you each time you enter the store or garage. Sea Salt City is full of sailors that imitate anything from pirates to flirty men. You'll encounter such people as Chastity the bartender, who looks anything but chaste, and be greeted as a comrade by Russian salesmen.   While you're driving between stops, a news ticker runs across the bottom of your screen. Although it repeats a lot, occasionally you'll catch it at just the right moment to read such messages as ~You'd expect these to be more useful wouldn't you?~ ~Evil trucker spotted / plot advancement soon,~ or ~Cletus abducted by aliensno one is surprised.~   Graphics  Big Mutha Truckers looks very much like an arcade game. You aren't going to see realistic shadowing or reflections. No licensed trucks grace this game. You aren't going to find animated drivers, particle effects, or glare from the sun.   These aren't high caliber graphics and they aren't the prettiest to ever grace a platform, but the style fits the subject matter perfectly. THQ did a great job creating the southern hickness that is prevalent throughout BMT. I can't imagine this game looking any other way. One small gripe is the total lack of lip synching. There really isn't that much dialogue in the game, but when people are ~talking~ and all you see is close ups of people's heads it gets bothersome.    The camera usually behaves itself. However, if you happen to get backed up into a corner (while you're backing up) the whole camera starts shaking as it tries to right itself. Also, you'll notice a long initial load of the game, but after you get to the main menu there aren't really any loading problems.    Sound  There is so much to listen to in Big Mutha Truckers. You've got the crunching of fenders, the crush of cars, screeching tires, and a badass horn. On top of all the typical sounds associated with games that have moving motorized vehicles. You have a wide selection of radio stations to choose from.   Music comes in five varieties, rock, techno-ish, new age, country, and talk show. It might not always suit your tastes, but you at least have choices. The best choice is to stick the channel on Yak so that you can hear all sorts of stereotypical southern fun making. You'll hear some interesting stories that touch on all sorts of redneck fun ranging from inbreeding to lost animals.  Big Mutha Truckers is an arcade game. It really is fun for a while, but the monotonous gameplay will soon catch up with you. There are only so many times you can bring yourself to traverse the highway from Capital City to Greenback.Although the novelty of driving a big rig soon stretches thin, the overall humor (until it gets recycled) of the game eases you through your sixty day excursion. A little more variety in gameplay and the ability to choose different routes to cities would really have helped the longevity of this title. However, at $20 you cant really resist the short lived entertainment that the southern stereotyping brings. Fun, but tiresome, Big Mutha Truckers is highly recommended as a rental.", "date": "Jul 1, 2003"}
