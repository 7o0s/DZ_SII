The legendary beasts are often much more powerful than playable characters, and can obliterate entire parties with magic, melee attacks, or their breath.  So it's really interesting when the concept of a game revolves around these incredible creatures rely upon mortal creatures to guard their survival.  NIS America and Hit Maker's most recent release of Dragoneer's Aria takes such an angle, placing the survival of the several dragons into the hands of your party.  Unfortunately, the extremely slow pacing of the title, coupled with the predictable plot and skewed battle system really reduces any enjoyment for this adventure.   The story behind Dragoneer's Aria places a new spin on the standard save the world format that many RPG games have become used to.  Centuries earlier, the Holy Dragon Grinlek was killed by a Black Dragon, but his soul spawned six new dragons to take his place.  With the help of dragoons, powerful human warriors, the dragons protected the world and banished the Black Dragon from the land.  Years pass, and the game begins with Valen Kessler, a young Dragoon in training who's getting ready to graduate from his academy.  During the graduation ceremony, the Black Dragon suddenly descends from the sky and destroys the capital city of Granadis.  Tasked with discovering the reason for the Black Dragon's reappearance, as well as the status of the other dragons, Valen embarks on a huge adventure.     Fortunately, Valen isn't alone in his adventure.  He'll slowly acquire new party members that will help him out along his quest, including Euphe, a mysterious young woman, Mary, a young pirate captain and Ruslan, a cynical swordsman.  For the most part, these characters fall along stereotypical lines - Valen is the latest scion of a legendary line that takes on a coming of age journey, Euphe is a girl with a hidden past that acts as a support role, Mary is the spunky kid forced to go it alone in the world, and Ruslan is the loner.  While you've probably heard all of these typical character descriptions before, what is somewhat different is that all of these characters essentially have their skills and abilities predetermined for them, which don't really change over the course of the game.   These are broken up into three main categories: Field, Battle and Dragon.  Field skills are abilities that can be triggered to help your party in exploration, such as sprinting across the land at a faster rate of speed or improving the recovery rate of health.  By contrast, Battle skills are tactical abilities used to support other teammates in the middle of combat, such as curing status ailments or protecting allies from incoming blows.  Finally, Dragon skills are dictated by orbs that each character equips which impart elemental abilities to weapon attacks, giving your strikes extra damage.  Depending on the monster you face, your characters can potentially use these skills to exploit weaknesses and eliminate them faster.  There are also two minor skills: Rush attacks, which lets you trigger multiple attacks with your character's weapon, and Guarding, which allows characters to try to block incoming damage by turning a certain number of spinning icons blue.   What the hell is that supposed to be? Unlike skills or abilities in other games, players can't always trigger them whenever you want.  To use these powers, players have to earn energy from either successful attacks in battle, guarding against attacks, using an item or encountering a mana point on the map.  Every 100 points you store equates to 1 mana point, which is required to use a basic skill.  More powerful forms of the skills require more points, which forces players to determine whether using a lower powered ability is a good idea, or if it's better to save your points up for a much stronger skill.  However, the mana system really is poorly implemented.  For one thing, the power meter that you collect energy with is permanently capped at 10 mana points.While that might not seem like a problem at first, you'll quickly discover that as you continually use your skills, you gain new power levels, which require more and more mana points to be used.  If you exhaust all of your points over the course of an attack or support skill (which can easily be done, particularly during difficult battles), you'll find yourself forced to rely on basic attacks until you can regain your energy.  Since your primary method of gaining energy is attacks which only generate 50 points of energy at a time, you'll find yourself quickly frustrated by this setup.  It's not particularly fun or useful when you have skills that you can't ever do anything with because you ever have enough energy to consistently use them    That frustration carries over to the battle system in a big way, which sucks because while you need to constantly grind to build up your characters, you'll hate every aspect of the battle system.  While you can always see your opponents on the battlefield in front of you, you never get a sense as to what the creatures are that you'll face.  For some reason, you only see a generic floating eye icon with wings, and while you can target them to see their relative strength to your party, you can't ever initiate contact to take an unaware monster by surprise or gain an advantage.  What's more, since you can often be snuck up on because the monsters have an incredible ability to disappear and attack you from behind or off camera, you frequently have no idea about what you're fighting until you're in the midst of battle.  But the most unforgivable sin with battles in Dragoneer's Aria is that the entire thing is as slow as molasses.  It can easily take more than ten minutes or more to kill a group of monsters, and what makes it worse is that you never seem to have the ability to avoid or completely escape battles.  This sets up a situation where you can have a fight with overpowered monsters that eliminates much of your party and miraculously escape from battle (which is a rare occurrence in the game), only to have the same group follow and kill you at another location on the map.   Wow, massive damage right there. Of course, as you defeat enemies, you'll gain experience, which is completely unrelated to your skills and only affects the amount of health that you acquire over the course of the game.  You'll also acquire money and at times items, which can be collected for various uses.  Obviously, if you manage to gain a health potion or an energy restorative, you can use those at any point you want, but there are other objects that you will have to either sell back in town to the various merchants, or keep and craft into new materials.  Dragoneer's Aria features a crafting system to allow one man's junk to become another man's treasure, but you need to have the recipes for each item that you want to create or you won't be able to do anything.  Since the stores that sell recipes don't always update with new formulas, you'll often find yourself dragging a ton of crap around without necessarily taking advantage of this system.   The visuals of Dragoneer's Aria, while not particularly horrible, aren't incredibly impressive either.  The generic monster icon before battle gives way to a variety of 3D monster models, many of which are presented decently, but there isn't particularly anything that's awe-inspiring or noteworthy.  In fact, even the titular dragons look rather bland and tame.  The same can be said for attack animations and visuals, which aren't incredible in the slightest bit.  Even worse, any and all visuals are drowned by incredibly generic menus and menu options, which pulls down the graphical strength of the title.   Should I be afraid of you? Sound for Dragoneer's Aria is somewhat stronger, thanks to some of the sound effects for monsters and attacks which aren't too bad.  Creatively, there are some nice piano solos as a closer to a fight or as a player levels up, which is a pleasant, although somewhat unexplained touch.  What's not particularly solid is the voice acting, which ranges from decent to horrible across the entire game.  Part of this can be blamed on the dialogue that the voice actors were given, which isn't the best that we've ever seen or heard.  However, a certain portion of the blame for the voice acting falls squarely upon the actors themselves, who miss a lot more than they hit.Unfortunately, Dragoneer's Aria takes a lot of clichd characters and tries to spice up the standard RPG fare with some adjustments to the skill and battle formula.  While the concepts behind them are interesting, the flawed implementation of energy and mana as well as the interminably slow battle mechanics really drags down the game.  If you're looking for an RPG for the PSP, you should really look elsewhere instead of this game.", "date": "Aug 30, 2007"}
