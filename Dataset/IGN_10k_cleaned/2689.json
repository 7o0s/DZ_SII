Mortal Kombat Advance is, by far, among the crappiest of the crap GBA titles made yet.  But SpyHunter could mark a serious turn-around for the publisher on the Game Boy Advance. The team responsible, an internal development studio no less, built a quality portable conversion of Midway's better-than-average action console title. The port, like the original, does have its design issues, but its obvious that the group in charge of the portable version really set out to produce a top-notch version of SpyHunter that GBA gamers can enjoy. Features Eight missions Hidden mini-missions and arcade mode Cartridge save Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Advance Spy Hunter was originally an arcade game released back in 1984. Its trademark use of the Peter Gunn theme accompanied the gameplay that put you in control of a vehicle racing in a top-down perspective. The challenge was to race through streets and waterways, taking out enemy vehicles and avoiding innocent bystanders. The game was recreated by Paradigm on the PlayStation 2 in 2001 as a behind-the-car mission-based action title, using the arcade idea as a basic foundation for the new game's design. It eventually made the jump to the GameCube and Xbox, and Midway's internal handheld development studio brought the design to the GBA as close as you're going to get on the handheld hardware.  The Game Boy Advance version of SpyHunter offers eight different missions in seven locations, but the missions all boil down to either simply driving like a maniac and blowing the hell out of the enemy vehicles and objects, or run over SATCOM icons (essentially ~activating~ them). Your car has an arsenal of weaponry, from basic machineguns to target-seeking missiles, all of which can be replenished by finding the power-up icons tossed around the roadways. If your vehicle takes too much damage, it will lose its structure and become a weaker two-wheeler with less firepower...finding the Weapons Van will put your vehicle back in tip-top shape.   The roadway whips and winds all over the place as you drive over them, and you'll have to go off the beaten path every so often to accomplish the secondary tasks in each mission...and if you don't backtrack, you'll never find the elements necessary to complete specific tasks.  The missions get pretty nasty in later levels, as not only the vehicles whittle away at your vehicle's armor, but so do these turret-type things on the sides of the road. Personally speaking I think in some areas it gets a bit too unfair with the amount of bullets thrown at you, since you really have no defense against them.  My biggest issue in SpyHunter is that it doesn't exactly tell you which objectives you've failed or passed while you're in the mission, nor does it give you the option to pull up the objective checklist during play. If you screw up somewhere, the game just says, ~Mission Failed.~ It would be very informative, just in case you weren't particularly paying attention at the beginning of the round, to pull up a screen that tells you exactly which mission you failed. And as cool as the oil slicks and smoke screen weapons are, they're mostly useless in the game since you can't see more than six feet behind your vehicle. They do come in handy in the game's two player modes since they'll slow up the trailing opponent, but in the actual missions, it's a rarity when you will actually put these two devices to use.  The overall production of SpyHunter is very high, with a decent Mode 7 engine put to use; the roadway scales and rotates at a smooth framerate, offering rolling hills to eliminate that usual, ~flat~ look in most Mode 7 racing games. Scaling sprite objects line the roadway with items such as shrubbery and cones ~blocking off~ the ~hidden~ branching pathways. When your vehicle skims across waterways, the development team implement a simple but effective reflection effect that definitely adds to the ~ooh, neat~ factor. Explosions and vehicle sprites tend to get a little blocky and ugly when close to the ~camera,~ but that's really a limitation of the hardware. The game even records your progress throughout the missions to cartridge...Midway foots for an EEPROM. Now that's telling you something right there. This remake of SpyHunter really boils down to a not-quite-as-good version of the Atari arcade game, Road Blaster...another property Midway now owns. As well-produced as SpyHunter is on the GBA, it's just not tight in its mission layouts, and the strategy isn't made very clear the first time around the course. It's also a real shame that the classic version of Spy Hunter didn't make it into the remake...the ~Arcade Mode~ is a nice try in simulating the game design of the original, but it's just not retro enough. Still, SpyHunter on the GBA shows that Midway actually cares about quality on the handheld now, and it basically gives us gamers hope that their future product for the Game Boy Advance won't suck as bad as they did last year. We're keeping our fingers crossed, guys.", "date": "Jun 4, 2002"}
