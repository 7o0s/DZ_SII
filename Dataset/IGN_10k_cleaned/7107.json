This has absolutely zero to do with some abject disgust for pulling mass-market entertainment properties into the mobile gaming realm. No, it stems from the fact that many licensed games suffer from shortened development cycles and money that could have been spent on making said game was actually funneled toward acquiring the license. For the most part, quality suffers because of this.   However, there are certainly exceptions to all conventional wisdom, and Pirates of the Caribbean Multiplayer is just that. Surely mDisney and Floodgate Entertainment were hoping to make a summer release to enjoy any good will generated by the wild success of the second Pirates film, but judging from the level of ambition found beyond the title screen, you would think this was an idea Floodgate had been incubating for years, not the typical timetable of a licensed mobile game.   Pirates capitalizes on one of mobile gaming's greatest untapped strengths -- always-on network capabilities. Up to sixteen players can board their own galleons and take to the high seas and battle others ships or sack coastal forts in pursuit of filthy lucre, captured flags, or the simple goal of being the last ship standing. (Or floating, as the case may be.) I certainly understand why few mobile games wade into the online experience -- most cellphone subscribers are paranoid about chewing up their airtime. Make no mistake, Pirates will eat minutes as it transmits its scurvy packets. But for mobile gamers with the resolve to sacrifice that narrated trip to the grocery store, Pirates offers an innovative experience that helps push the concept of mobile gaming in an exciting new direction. This is the kind of game that gets the jaded console gamer, he who proclaims that ~game play is king~ but then thumbs his nose at Tower Bloxx, to take notice.   Notice I've tossed around terms like ~innovative~ and ~exciting new direction,~ but have yet to confirm whether or not the game is any fun? Enjoying Pirates is like digging for buried treasure. Everybody downloads the same game knowing the X marks the spot, but getting to the booty takes time and I suspect that the real casual set will lose patience. My fear is people will immediately just leap online and accidentally slip into the least amusing of the three game modes: Plunder the Port, an overly complicated mess where you have to sack a town, carry gold to a goal, and destroy forts to ensure safe passage. Trying to coordinate such a strategy without voice is an exercise in serious frustration.   Far better is the Broadside Brawl mode, which is essentially a deathmatch with ships. There's no need for explanation or exposition, you just get in there and start firing the cannons at anything that moves. The more ships in play, the more fun you'll have. (To address your concern of not having anybody to play with... on the first day, I found eight people to play with. As I've logged back in over the last week, I have consistently found people on the servers. Never have I logged in to a ghost town.) There is a third mode, called Jolly Roger which is basically ~capture the flag,~ but it's not as fun as Broadside Brawl.   Another concern I have are the controls. Using relative controls to steer your ship around reefs and sandbars isn't the most intuitive set-up. It takes time to get used to pressing up to gain speed, no matter what direction you are facing. I would have definitely preferred if the ship just went in the direction you pressed. Does that accurately mimic turning a ship's wheel? No, but it makes the game easier to hop right into. However, after a good ten minutes, I got the hang of steering while engaging in a ship battle -- you want to fire at any enemy ship's broadside, requiring you to pull up next to them rather than steer into them.   Now, the network play isn't 100-percent perfect. I've witnessed some lag and seen ships materialize elsewhere on the map after a few stuttered frames. But I have yet to be dropped from a game, which is more than I can say for my experience playing Halo 2. And as Pirates is a pure network game, Floodgate has included some useful online tools for communicating and setting up guilds. The game also tracks performance, which is measured in Infamy. Infamy is not just a simple stat, though. The game offers special items to players that keep logging in and sailing around the game's 30 maps. These items include things like a spyglass that increases cannon range or a parrot that inspires your men to row faster.   There are also in-game power-ups to sail over and pick up, such as the Turner's Rudder. They actually have a tangible effect on game play, too. Fear the player that uncovers Barbossa's Revenge, a damage-increasing artifact. The game also lets you choose from three ships, like a sloop that goes fast due to its lack of armor or the more even-keel brigantine.  Pirates of the Caribbean Multiplayer shows that mDisney and Floodgate aren't interested in just scoring a quick buck off a hot license, but in making the mobile game arena a more interesting place to play around in. The learning curve is a little steep, thanks to the controls, and not all of the game modes are winners. But every time I logged in, there were people keeping at it and having a good time sinking ships. If you check the community, it seems the game already has some die hard fans. Much like EA Mobile's Orcs & Elves, Pirates stands to bridge the mobile and traditional vidder communities as well as offer dedicated cell gamers an antidote to puzzle and poker games.", "date": "Aug 2, 2006"}
