The console games are solid ventures with a nice mixture of clever gameplay elements and humor in the storyline. The Game Boy Advance version, however, has very little of what made the console game original or unique, becoming yet another standard side-scroller on the handheld. But the game has a few more problems in its design that bring its marks down further. Features Eight worlds  Cartridge save (three slots)  The Game Boy Advance version doesn't have the luxury of the console editions' FMV cutscenes to tell the tale of Tak, so the game's story, similar to the GameCube and PS2 versions, unfolds through little conversations between the characters. According to Pupununu prophecy, an evil shaman named Tlaloc will be passed over during village elder selection in favor of Jibolba. Out of jealousy and rage, Tlaloc steals the Moon Stones, a source of great power that the Moon Juju uses to shield the Pupununu village from evil. If that isn't bad enough, as a farewell present he's going to turn all the villagers into sheep. And that's where Tak comes in. He's the hero of the game, you see.  Oh, the game starts out decently enough, and in fact I was initially impressed with the effort that went into the presentation. The level graphics and character animations were well-produced, even though the license is based around a future CG animated series and the GBA version focuses on pixel art for its backgrounds and sprites. The accompanying tunes are appropriately happy with a nice rhythmic tribal beat, and the games controls are simple to grasp with solid collision detection between character, enemy, and platform objects.  But then the little things start to seep in and affect the enjoyment of the game. For example: Tak starts out with a long-distance, wimpy blowgun weapon that can only stun enemies, but soon into the game he'll earn a more powerful, up-close club to thwart enemies. Players can switch between the two, but the level designers never offer any real incentive to do so; it's much more responsive to use the club 99% of the time...so there's only maybe one or two situations where it's absolutely required to whip out the peashooter. And many of the game's platform elements focus around leaping over stupid little thorn bushes that initially blend in with the background objects. There are only a few elements that add variety to the level design: some levels let you fly around in a chicken suit or swim around as a fish. But they're very few and far between, and don't really offer much that's never been done before. There's also a poor balance problem that both adds frustration and makes it easy to beat. As with most platformers, Tak become temporarily invincible when taking  a hit from an enemy...and temporary means barely a half second, which doesn't give players much time to correct their mistake or to get out of the way of another. But then, there are health feathers strategically positioned in some of these awkward areas, almost as if the level designers saw these unfair situations and are offering something to remedy it.  And then there's the overwhelming feeling that Tak: The Power of Juju isn't a finished product, shipped out before its time simply to make the release of the console versions. Here's a great example: one of the tasks in Tak is to rescue sheep scattered around the level, each level having its own number of sheep to rescue as indicated by the number at the top of the screen. Nowhere in the game does it tell you why you're rescuing sheep (other than the fact that they're apparently transformed tribesmates), it doesn't penalize for leaving a few behind, nor does it reward for collecting them. It's like the intention was there to give players an incentive to score 100%, but there's nothing offered. And even if you do leave some behind, it's not like you can go back to previous levels to try again...once you've hit the end point, that's it. The only way to go back is to start the game over. I've been covering the Game Boy market for several years now, so I'm pretty accustomed to the tradition of producing side-scrolling action games for handheld versions of bigger game productions. Tak and the Power of Juju has a lot of potential that's never met; decent music and graphics aren't enough for a ~good~ platformer. The little problems surface early on, and it just ends up being a very mediocre, almost unfinished design. Yes, it's a challenge, but it's not much of a fun one.", "date": "Oct 30, 2003"}
