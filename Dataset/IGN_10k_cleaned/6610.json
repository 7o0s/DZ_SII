If you're looking for a way to school your eye and play ultra-realistic pool without the risk of getting hustled by some small-town pool demon with a dirty glove, this is it.GameplayCeleris managed to faithfully port over the sharp hi-res graphics of the PC version to create a simple, but good-looking N64 pool game. Never mind the optional room backgrounds. Purists will quickly switch them off and concentrate on what counts: The table, the cue and their balls.The game features six different types of pool, all following the rules laid down by the American Pool Players Association:~ 8-Ball: The player who legally sinks the 8-ball wins. However, you must sink all of the solid balls or all of the striped balls first. Scratching on the 8-ball or prematurely sinking the 8-ball loses the game. 9-Ball: The player who sinks the 9-ball wins. The lowest numbered ball must always be hit first. 10-Ball: The player who sinks the 10-ball wins. The lowest numbered ball must always be hit first. 6-Ball: The player who sinks the 6-Ball wins. The lowest numbered ball must always be hit first. 3-Ball: The player who sinks the last ball wins. The lowest numbered ball must always be hit first. Rotation Pool: The object is to reach 61 points. When you sink a ball, you receive that ball's number as points. The lowest numbered ball must always be hit first. Straight Pool: The object is to reach a pre-determined number of points. Each ball scores one point. Fouls subtract points from your score. Bank Pool: The first player to score eight balls wins. Each legal bank shot made awards the player one ball. Fore each foul the player loses one ball. One Pocket: The first player to score eight balls wins. Each shot made into a player's pocket awards that player one ball. For each foul the player loses one.No matter which variation you choose, you will immediately impressed by Celeris' seasoned pool physics engine. The developer used floating point operations to guarantee extremely accurate ball collision trajectories and completely realistic table physics. Using the analog stick and the C buttons, players have complete control over force, spin and cue angle. Unlike most pool games, Virtual Pool doesn't use a moving shot meter -- the shot control is fully analog. Being able to gently push the stick forward is very important for the more tricky shots, so if you're not good at using the analog stick you may find Virtual Pool's controls a bit unforgiving. But VP's control system ultimately pays off. Like with real pool, it's only a matter of time until you get the hang of it.Virtual Pool offers three levels of difficulty: Amateur, Professional and Championship and the ability to adjust the table characteristics for your liking (pocket size, pocket cut, rail cushioning and table speed). Pool afficionados will also be happy to hear that the game features full stats support and tracks how many games you have played, how many you have won, the ball making average, balls made per turn, shots at 9-ball and 9-ball shots made. Beginners will also love the ability to bring up trajectory overlays when practicing shots.You will also find the usual array of options and modes, including Match Play, Tournament (from your local pub to the World Championship), Freestyle, and Shark Skins. While playing with two (or four, in Free Style) players is a lot of fun, learning some of the built-in trick shots (including hugs, jumps and curves) is probably the best recipe for making serious dough at your local pool hangout.While the control and physics are impressive, there are a few downers as well. Camera control and angle selection is rather clumsy and VP64 has the same disease of its PC predecessors: the disappearing ball syndrome. Instead of creating polygonal pockets that show the balls sink into the pockets, balls simply vanish into thin air after a successful shot. Cheap.Like Westwood's Golden Nugget, Virtual Pool is no substitute for the real thing. Celeris has faithfully recreated pool, but nothing more. The final result is a highly accurate game that's fun to play, but somewhat lacks the spirit of real pool.GraphicsVirtual Pool uses the N64's high resolution mode (640X480) to create exceptionally sharp visuals. There is not much variety and the pool hall backgrounds are a bit pixelated, but the shiny balls and well-lit tables are all done with great style. Nice specular highlighting, too.SoundThe sound effects are realistic and make the game sound like the real thing, but the music is utter crap. Imagine poor midi music being ported 1:1 from your PC to the N64. Shudder.Virtual Pool is a competent pool sim that perfectly simulates the table, physics and feel of the real game. The hi-res graphics are excellent and pool fans will find all the right options and gameplay modes. The only problem I have with the game is that it doesn't go the extra mile to create the atmosphere of a pool hall, a pub, or a billiards championship. Everything comes across as a little too sterile. The addition of different characters and real environments would been cool, but as it stands, VP still gets the job done remarkably well. A good first title from Celeris.", "date": "Jan 12, 1999"}
