Grand Theft Auto 3, Final Fantasy X, and Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty were all released within literally weeks of each other, and all have gone on to be some of the highest selling games ever.  All three games had also been rumored to be coming to the Xbox.  Now, almost exactly one year later, we have finally received one of the games that was reason enough to own a PS2 last year: Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty.    Rather than just release a direct port of the game, Konami has taken the time to add some ~substance~ to the game.  The big complaint about the Sons of Liberty was that there was too much watching and not enough action.  So, in response, Konami has gone back and release what they feel is the ~complete~, full version of Metal Gear Solid 2.     For those unfamiliar with the Metal Gear series (shame on you!), here's a little background info: You assume the role of Solid Snake, co-founder of activist group Philanthropy, and ex-member of government special forces group, Fox-Hound.  Your goal is to raise the public's awareness about the different Metal Gears (giant mech-like machines of mass destruction) that are created in hopes that their development will cease altogether.  The other co-founder of Philanthropy, Hal ~Otacon~ Emmerich, was an engineer on the Metal Gear REX (from MGS1) project, and eventually switched sides after realizing the real reason Metal Gear was created (to use as a nuclear weapon).  Every Metal Gear game involves some sort of new Metal Gear that is being built, and your mission to stop it.    Gameplay The unique aspect of the Metal Gear games (including Metal Gear Solid 2) is that they promote stealth over action.  The best way through a level is to do it without being seen or heard.  To aid you in sneaking past the enemy, there is a radar in the upper-right hand corner of the screen that displays your position, as well as enemy positions and their field of vision.  If you are seen, your radar is disabled and the enemy will call for backup.  If that happens, you must try and kill them all, or run away hoping they don't shoot you down before you reach a safe hiding place.    Being seen is not the only thing you have to worry about.  The enemy also has ears, and if you make too much noise, they will go investigate the source of the sound.  Walking on certain surfaces, shooting an un-silenced gun, leaving a blood trail, or even sneezing from a cold will get you in big trouble.  Also, leaving a dead body lying around will alert the enemies of an intruder if seen, while knocking them out with a tranquilizer will cause their fellow soldiers to wake them up.  Luckily, you can hide bodies in dark corners or lockers, and you can also throw them off the side of the ship in the tanker chapter.    Where's the party yo?  Being trained to be a one-man army by the government has its perks.  Unlike most action games where the character can only run, shoot, and jump, Snake can do much, much more.  For example, Snake can flatten himself against a wall and peek around corners to see what's there without being seen himself.  He can also purposely create noises to lure soldiers around corners.  Wanna hang from a ledge to hide yourself while the enemy passes you by?  Go for it.  How about hiding in an empty locker or used cardboard box?  Sure, why not?   Even though being stealthy and avoiding the enemy is best, you are not helpless.  For one thing, you are skilled in hand-to-hand combat.  You can pull of a punch/kick combo, perform a diving roll to knock down the enemy, and you can also choke someone from behind, eventually breaking their neck.  Definitely the most silent way to kill an enemy.  But, if your hands are feeling a little sore, you can always revert to your weapons.  Handguns, grenade and missile launchers, sniper guns, swords, and mines are all at your disposal.  Your guns are useful for more than just killing.  You can actually hold-up enemies convenient store-style and make them drop items.  Or make them cringe in fear if you so please.  The list of items is also extensive, though using all of them is not necessary.  Cardboard boxes, magazines, night-vision goggles, and cold medicine are just a few of the items you'll find along the way.  Heck, you can even smoke cigarettes if you want to!   Major parts of the story are told through well-directed cutscenes, but you will also receive a ton of information through your Codec, a military-created communications system where the receiver is directly linked to your inner ear, making eavesdropping impossible.  To use the Codec, you must dial a specified frequency, after which you can have direct communication with the other person.  Even though all of the conversation is spoken, it is also shown as text on the screen.  I wish so much of the game's story wasn't told through the Codec, but it is bearable.  On a side note, if you call certain people repeated times, or at specific moments in the game, you will hear and see some pretty interesting and outlandish material, so experiment and be amused!    There are very few differences between the Xbox and PS2 version of the game.  Of course the control scheme is slightly altered due to the lack of two extra trigger buttons (which are more or less made up for with the black and white buttons), but the core of the control scheme remains the same.  Also, a few of the pictures and posters of sexy Japanese women and FHM magazine covers found in the PS2 game seem to have been replaced with different pictures.  Another addition to the Xbox version is the ability to play the tanker and Big Shell levels separately, or together.  Because the two chapters of the game are very separate, each chapter feels like its own, short game.      During the cutscenes, you can also hold the right trigger and zoom in on the screen.  Using the right analog stick to move the camera around.  While you can't move it a full 360 degrees, you can move it up, down, left, or right within the boundaries of an invisible square.  One of the cool things you can notice with this is that if you zoom in on an area that is depth-blurred, it will actually clear up, like you are really looking at the object closer.  The only other noticeable difference found was during the Codec scenes.  In Sons of Liberty on the PS2, you could press the trigger buttons to hear what the characters were thinking.  On the Xbox, you can still do it, but it sounds different: more echo-like and separated.  You'll be glad to know that all of the gags from the PS2 version were left in such as the masturbation scene, kissing the posters, the video of the Japanese woman in her apartment, and the Raven figurine.    Sons of Liberty Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty is the main portion of the game, and the story involves the rumor of a new Metal Gear being developed by the U.S. Marines.  Your job is to find out more information and confirm its existence.  Because the game is so heavy on its story, I'll refrain from saying much more.  It really is something that is best experienced knowing as little possible.  There are tons of plot twists and deceptions, and even though the story can become a little too convoluted at times, Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance is a great piece of storytelling.      Substance VR and Alternative Missions Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance is the same game thousands of gamers played last year, only with a really nice bundle of extras added on.  The largest of these is the addition of VR missions.  These are just like the ones found in the original Metal Gear Solid, only reworked graphically, and including the new weapons found in Metal Gear Solid 2.  These timed missions are completely independent of the game's story and test your skill with the character's abilities and weapons.  The VR missions are broken down into four categories: Sneaking Mode, Weapon Mode, First Person View Mode, and Variety.  Let's start with the Sneaking Mode.  Sneaking Mode is broken down into Sneaking and Eliminate All.  In Sneaking, the objective is to reach the goal at the end of the level without being detected.  The first few levels are extremely basic and contain a couple of enemies at most.  Finishing these takes literally seconds to complete.  The later levels become much more complex with the number of enemies increased, fewer places to hide, and multiple stories to navigate, just to name a few of the complications.    In Eliminate All, your job is to take out every enemy in the level within the time limit.  The catch is that you have to do it without being seen.  Again, the early levels start out relatively simple and get increasingly more difficult as you work your way through the levels.  Disappearing floors, having your footprints glow, and tight spaces, along with everything else found in the Sneaking levels make your life a bit tougher than you'd like.    The pool party pooper  After Sneaking Mode comes Weapon Mode, which is broken down into the different types of weapons you will use during the course of the game.  They are: Handgun, Assault Rifle, C4/Claymore, Grenade, PSG-1, Stinger, Nikita, and HF.Blade.  When playing as Snake, the HF.Blade is unavailable, and is replaced by No Weapon.  The weapons levels have you destroying targets within a set time limit with the given weapon.  The targets themselves will take different shapes and sizes depending on the weapon level selected.  Sometimes the targets will be stationary cubes while in other levels the targets may be moving diamonds that take multiple hits to destroy.  There are roughly five different shapes the targets may take, with certain weapons being better suited to destroy them than others.     Moving down the line, we come to First Person View Mode.  These levels are exactly what they sound like ? VR missions with a first-person view, rather than the traditional third-person perspective the game normally uses.  The objectives in these missions are just variations on the ones found in Sneaking and Weapons mode.  Controlling your character in first-person is actually quite smooth.  The button layout is more or less the same, with the major differences being the way you move and look around.  Thankfully, there are three separate control configurations you can choose from, so you should be able to find one that suits your tastes.  A fully configurable control scheme would've been nice, but the ones supplied are plenty sufficient.   After you complete the Sneaking, Weapon, and First Person Mode, you will unlock Variety Mode.  This mode contains a, um, variety of different tasks you must complete, and they are definitely some of the most enjoyable ones because they offers something more than just sneaking or shooting.  One of the most memorable ones asks you to reach a goal marker without being seen by any of the gigantic creatures, creatures meaning gigantic Godzilla-sized versions of the enemy soldiers.  Not only are they Godzilla-sized, but they also stomp, roar, and have fins just like everyone's favorite rubber-suited Japanese lizard.  Many of the other levels also provide some very cool moments, including a cameo by one very special girl, but I'll try to not spoil it for you.  You can choose to complete the VR missions with either Raiden or Snake, with Snake's levels tending to be a little bit more difficult and have different enemy placement.  After you complete a set number of levels, you will open up a new version of Raiden or Snake, depending on whom you used to complete the missions.  These alternate versions are really just costume changes, but there are some really cool outfits, including the Ninja outfit, and Snake's original costume from MGS1.  Each character variation also has their own set VR missions to tackle, but they are not as numerous as Raiden's and Snake's.          After you complete each level you are given a score and, if you score high enough, are placed in the top three rankings.  You score is calculated from three different factors: time, bullets used, and a no-kill bonus.  Ideally you want to complete the missions in the quickest time possible, and only use the amount of bullets needed to complete the mission.  If you score first place in any of the missions, you can view a clear code which you can enter in at www.konamijph.com/mbs2_sub/.  The site is not working yet, but you can be sure that it will show your ranking amongst all the other gamers who enter in their codes, just like the one used for Sons of Liberty.  In addition to the VR missions, there is an Alternative missions mode, which can also be played by any of the characters.  These are similar to the VR missions but take place in sections of the game's levels (the tanker, the Arena, and the Big Shell) rather than in the VR-constructed levels.  The types of objectives are also slightly different, and consist of things like bomb diffusing, taking pictures, and practicing your hold-up skills.  These levels were originally supposed to be included in Sons of Liberty, but were left out due to time constraints.  Because Sons of Liberty was so story-driven, and was not really focused on the action aspects of the game, many gameplay aspects were not fully realized.  So, to shift the focus back on the gameplay aspects of the game, the Alternative missions were added.  Like the VR missions, the different costumed characters have their own set of Alternative missions.          Overall, the VR and Alternative missions are a fantastic addition.  They are quick, enjoyable, and challenging, and will really test your Metal Gear skills to their limit.  Trying to score first place in each of the VR missions alone (there are roughly 200 of them) may turn you into an obsessive-compulsive Metal Gear hermit, so don't say I didn't warn you.  What's really interesting about these missions is the potential they show for future installments of the Metal Gear series.  Sure, the missions are extremely fun, but they are also detached from the storyline.  Given enough time, Kojima and his team of ingenious artists, designers, and programmers could make an epic amalgam of an expansive story and fully realized gameplay.   Snake Tales The other major addition to Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance is a mode labeled Snake Tales.  I'm sure more than a couple of you were disappointed when you realized you couldn't play Snake anymore.  Well, these levels are for you.  Unlike the VR or Alternative missions, the five Snake Tales are story based, and though the story elements use characters and environments from the Sons of Liberty game, they are unrelated to main storyline.  The story is told through text pages that you scroll through using the control pad.  Whenever there feels like there should be a cutscene, more text appears that you have to read through in order to follow the story.  These ~what if~ missions definitely have their appeal, and being able to play as Snake in the Big Shell level is reward enough.  The length of the missions ranges from short to medium to long in length, with the longest ones taking about the same amount of time as an objective in the main game.  My main complaint about these missions is that you have to read text rather than being shown cutscenes.  The text reads like a script, and isn't nearly as effective in telling the story as the game's excellent cutscenes, but they do suffice.    A big difference between these missions and the ones in the main quest is that not only do you not have access to the Codec, but there is also no radar.  You can imagine how tough these levels can get.  Nonetheless, they are, like the other extra missions, highly rewarding and definitely challenging.      Ico, we don't need no stinkin' Ico! More Extras After you've finished the Sons of Liberty quest, and the 350+ VR missions, and the 150+ Alternative missions, AND the five Snake Tales missions, you can play the Boss Survival mode.  These missions are also scored, and you can enter a clear code at the Konami website to see how you rank against other players.  Along with the Boss Survival mode, there is also a Casting Theater mode that you can open up.  There are also a few other secrets, but you'll have to find those on your own.      Graphics Even though Metal Gear Solid 2 was released a year ago, it is still a great-looking game and continues to graphically rival many of the games that have recently been released, Xbox or PS2.  The character models are still some of the best you're likely to find in any game, with their smooth curves and stylized, yet realistic faces.    One of the best visual qualities of Metal Gear Solid 2 is character animation.  I cannot think of another game in which the characters move as smoothly and as lifelike as they do in MGS2.  It looks so great that it makes even the simplest actions look interesting.  I don't know how many times I stuffed a body in a locker, or tried rolling down the stairs just to fail miserably and tumble over.  There are so many varied animations between your character and the enemies that you could spend hours just observing yourself and the world around you.  Where the animation really stands out though is in the cut-scenes.  The characters are full of life and move with such fluidity that it almost seems too perfect.  Like Richard Linklater's Waking Life, the onscreen character graphics seem as if they were painted over real live actors movements to provide the game models with a subtlety that could only be captured from a live human being.  And all this runs at 60 fps...most of the time.  Even though the framerate stays buttery smooth throughout most of the game, there are some instances of extreme slowdown, most noticeable during the outside raining scenes on the tanker level.  It doesn't occur very often, and almost never affects gameplay, but it is there.  Oddly, it seemed to happen most when there wasn't anything really happening onscreen.  Just the rain.  In fact, the rain is exactly what is causing the slowdown.  When Kojima and company created the tanker level, they first created the entire scene, then added filters, like the rain and mist, on top of it to create the impressive weather effects.  Because the game was originally made and optimized for the PS2, which has a very unique hardware configuration, the game ran at 60 fps with no hiccups.  Unfortunately, the algorithm used to create the weather effects did not translate too well when trying to implement it on the Xbox hardware, hence the slowdown.  It probably would have been too much work to come up with and implement a new algorithm, and since it really doesn't affect gameplay, Konami may have felt it was good enough as is.  So, practicality and not sloppy programming is responsible for the slowdown.  Slowdown occurs in a few other places too, namely the boss fights, but it doesn't really make a difference.         Metal Gear Solid 2 relied heavily on the motion-blurring effect found in so many PS2 games.  It was used in every cutscene, and in Metal Gear Solid 2, that means at least 70% of the time.  The effect gives everything a soft, dreamy appearance, kind of like watching a daytime soap opera.  Again, the PS2's implementation of the motion-blurring has some very unique qualities about it, and those too did not translate over to the Xbox as nicely as they should of.  Instead, the blurring effect seems a bit harsher on the Xbox.  If you've never played the PS2 version it's really not noticeable, but having played the original version to death, it seemed to stick out.          Excluding the specifics above, the graphics in Substance are almost identical to those found in Sons of Liberty.  The overall quality may be a little more crisp and clean, but the difference is nothing to write home about.    You know you want it. Sounds Some people describe Metal Gear Solid 2 as an interactive movie, and in a sense, they are right.  You seem to watch cutscenes just as often as you actually get to take control of the character.  What makes the game seem even more cinema-like is the powerful musical score composed by Harry Gregson-Williams.  Gregson-Williams has composed scores for a variety a movies including The Rock, Antz, Spy Game, and the upcoming Shrek 2.  His experience with scoring Hollywood films, especially big-name action films (The Rock, Armageddon, Spy Game), really adds to the tension and drama found in the game.    The music is not always in full force though.  In fact, most of the gameplay time is accompanied by subtle, ambient sounds and music rather than an intense musical score like Medal of Honor.  Things do pick up, like when you are spotted by a soldier, and when they do, it can be very unnerving.  The jerking alert sound used when detected, along with the suspenseful background music, still cause my heart to race and my forehead to sweat while I try and find an escape route.    Also of exceptional quality is the voice acting, especially the character of Solid Snake, voiced by David Hayter.  Hayter has quite a bit of experience doing voices for not only games, but animation as well.  He has had voice roles in Miyazaki's The Castle of Cagliostro, Fushigi Yugi, Cowboy Bebop, as well as Nintendo's latest horror game, Eternal Darkness.  His rough, throaty voice is so perfect for Snake, it's hard to imagine him sounding like anyone else.  All the other voices are done just as well, and also do a fine job at giving their characters a little more life.         Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance is like a fully loaded special edition DVD of your favorite movie.  In this case, the movie is Sons of Liberty.  If you've already played through the PS2 version and are wondering if you should buy this, the question you should ask yourself is, ~Are the VR/Alternative missions, and the rest of the extras, worth $50?~  If you also own the Document of Metal Gear Solid 2, you've already had a taste of what the VR missions have to offer.  If only Document had also been included in Substance...  On the other hand, if you've never played the PS2 version of Metal Gear Solid 2, then this game is a definite must-play.  Even though the game is year old, it is still an unbelievable game.  I know many of you are wondering if it is better than Splinter Cell, but the truth is, they're really different games.  Sure, both involve sneaking, and the government, and all that other hoopla, but the approach is entirely different, just like Gran Turismo 3 and Need for Speed are both racing games.  If possible, get both games.  If not, try them both out and see which one is more your cup of tea.", "date": "Nov 8, 2002"}
