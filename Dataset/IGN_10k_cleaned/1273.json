This game is a Pokmon/Monster Rancher clone that outdoes Nintendo's property in the Adorable Factor so much you'll need an insulin shot to combat the sweetness. Unfortunately, swooning over big-eyed fuzzy-eared animals isn't really considered ~gameplay~ in Game Boy channels (at least in these parts), and while gamers might pick up Lil' Monsters because it reminds them of Nintendo's Pocket Monsters, they're not going to get nearly as friendly playability.FeaturesMore than 60 monstersThree save game slotsLink cable support for two playersFor Game Boy and Game Boy ColorIf you can actually get through the game's spottily translated introduction (Lil' Monsters was a low-key game released in Japan first), you'll learn that the world has these tin cans that can transform energy gems into creatures that you can collect and train. This world has gotten into the trend of fighting these creatures against each other for bragging points, but there's one guy out there that's constantly breaking the rules of battle. His name: Cool Joe.So it's up to you to figure out what this guy is up to. How? By battling monsters with your own and collecting their gems  every battle strengthens your creature, making him stronger. You can enter tournaments to earn cash for better gems to convert into critters  otherwise these gems are used for your available creature in battle, since each gem has a specific ~attack~ capability.There are more than sixty little monsters in Lil' Monsters, and each creature belongs to a specific suit: clubs, hearts, spades, and diamonds. Spade creatures are weak against Diamonds, Diamonds are weak against Clubs, Clubs are weak against Hearts, and Hearts are weak against Spades. Sounds pretty familiar, doesn't it?Strategies in battle are very reminiscent of card games like Pokmon Trading Card Game where you have to organize your creatures' fighting abilities by sorting through your available gems. Battles are of a one-on-one nature, and you'll have to remember to put in a few healing gems if you want to survive a lengthy fight. Each gem has its own powers, from offensive kicks and punches, to obscure abilities such as stealing hitpoints or ~shuffling~ the enemies gems. Heck, there's even an attack that drops poop on the enemy to take away his ability to fight temporarily  how'd this one get past the ESRB? The battles are very interesting, offering a neat, Pokmon/Monster Rancher Card interface. But unfortunately, the game doesn't have a very interesting RPG element that's important to this type of game  exploration. Instead of wandering a huge map in an overhead perspective like in Pokmon, Final Fantasy, or every other Japanese-style RPG, you simply hop from place to place, hoping that you'll randomly encounter another monster to battle. Problem is, these encounters are VERY rare, and most of the time you'll have to resort to pulling out another one of your creatures to battle in an ~exhibition~ style fight. And battling isn't easy  I'm guessing kids are going to have a hard time figuring this game out. I sure as heck did.But man, are the characters cute. They're just so darn adorable. Creatures, Inc. could use a few of Lil' Monster's character designers for the next incarnation of Pokemon. But cute and cuddly is only a tiny bit of Pokmon's appeal, and Lil' Monsters needs to be a lot more friendly and a lot more ~action-packed~ if it wants to tread in the Pocket Monster territory. Yes, this is a Pokmon cash-in. No, it's not as good as Pokmon. It's got a few things going for it, but the entire game's implementation, from the shoddy English translation to the gaps in gameplay, make this one average at best. The artwork is fabulous, but I need a lot more than just pretty pictures to enjoy a Game Boy Color game.", "date": "Sep 23, 2000"}
