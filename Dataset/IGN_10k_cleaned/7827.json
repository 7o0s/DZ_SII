The Tomb Raider series has always had a lot in common with the platforming adventure gameplay of the Prince of Persia games, and that connection has been even stronger in Lara's 2D appearances on the Game Boy. Her last outing, 2002's Tomb Raider: The Prophecy, was displayed from an overhead perspective. The similarities weren't so strong. But here she returns to her roots. Tomb Raider: Legend, Lara's first portable title in over four years, has her side-scrolling, ledge-leaping and wall-jumping all over again. It's a clone of Prince of Persia's classic platforming design to be sure  unfortunately, Lara's imitation doesn't live up to the example of her idol.    Tomb Raider: Legend starts with a flashback, as a cutscene gives us a glimpse of the events that led to the death of Lara's mother 15 years ago. The game then jumps to present day, and the plot finds our heroine on another globetrotting journey that starts with the discovery of an Incan ruin and leads her to ancient temples and hazardous dungeons all over the planet. Locations in Legend include Bolivia, Peru and even the new Borat-fueled tourist hotspot Kazakhstan. The past is not forgotten, though, as through the course of Lara's modern day journey more pieces of her enigmatic character are brought into focus. You'll just have to wait a while for that focus to become clear.    Cartridge games aren't supposed to have load times. Tomb Raider: Legend does. They're an immediate distraction that take away from establishing a sense of immersion with Lara's latest adventure, and other elements in the title simply add to the negative momentum. It's hard to get into the game. And if and when you manage to, some frustrating feature will pull you right back out.    The gameplay in Legend is 2D precision platforming. Precision is the key word, because unlike other platformer games, this take on Tomb Raider demands near perfection. Lara must be placed accurately and meticulously for her jumps and grabs from platform to platform to be successful. On one hand, the execution is a faithful recreation of the original Prince of Persia style. On the other, it's maybe too faithful a recreation. This engine is totally unforgiving, as being off-target by even the slimmest of margins is enough to send Ms. Croft plummeting to her doom again and again.    And missing the mark isn't uncommon, as marks are easily missed in the muddy and indistinct environments she chooses to travel through. Lara herself is animated well, it's just her stages that need help. Good luck telling the difference between what is and isn't a platform or other interactive object in these ambiguous backgrounds.    Level progression is occasionally interrupted by combat, which amounts to simple button-mashing. Hit A fast enough and your bullets will drop the bad guy, be he armed terrorist or wild jungle beast. If the former, the fallen foe will drop his weapon. You can pick it up and wield it, but there's no change in Lara's sprite. She appears to be holding a simple pistol even if you're armed with a shotgun.       Putting the negatives aside, there are a few elements in Tomb Raider: Legend that are done rather well. Chief among them are the comic-style cutscenes, which bookend each stage and move the story along. These scenes are incredibly well illustrated comic book pages, overlaid with word bubble dialogue. The style is bold and impressive, and would be great to see expanded upon in future Tomb Raider titles. Enough of the old 3D models and polygonal artwork, that time has passed. Let's see this pen-and-ink Lara get a chance to shine.    Accessible from the main menu are a handful of extra options, including unlockable features. Some mini-games can be found here, if you've earned enough treasure in the main game to be able to purchase them. They're mostly basic puzzles, but Klotski  a classic sliding block puzzler  is surprisingly addictive. You may have seen it before as a simple board game where you move small cars out of the way so that one large truck can make it to an exit point. Its inclusion here is a bit out of place, but it adds value to an otherwise unremarkable package.When your unlockable mini-games are more fun than your main adventure, you're in trouble. Tomb Raider: Legend has too many frustrations to forgive, taking what could have been a good Persia-style platformer clone and knocking it down to bland mediocrity. If you're a Lara fan, stick with the one of the console versions of this Legend  there's much more fun to be had there.", "date": "Dec 14, 2006"}
