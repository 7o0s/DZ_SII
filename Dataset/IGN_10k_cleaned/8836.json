If you thought Halo had a mad following, just wait until you run into one of these Marathon nuts. They swear by Bungie's old shooter and with good reason. Marathon is a very solid game and a more sophisticated alternative to the id classic, DOOM. But be warned, though Marathon is fun, it may turn your stomach. Marathon's bonus XBLA feature is motion sickness. Those with a strong stomach (or a medicinal cure) will find a fun and fairly lengthy adventure.   Marathon: Durandal is the second in the trilogy. The story takes place 17 years after the original, though you don't have to know squat about Marathon to quickly catch on to what's happening. You're a marine, decked out in Mjolnir Mark IV armor (though it's not quite what we see Master Chief wearing), charged with stopping an alien force from discovering the location of Earth. As we all know, once any alien force finds out where we hide our K-Marts, an invasion is imminent.    Assisting you on this lengthy adventure is an AI named Durandal. The story is told mostly through Durandal via computer screen text. Durandal has a wicked sense of humor, but mixes in important information with the exposition and quips. So if you don't read carefully, you will probably spend a lot of time wandering around trying to figure out what the hell you're supposed to be doing.    Marathon is a 3D shooter very similar in appearance to DOOM. But don't sell Marathon short. It's got a lot more going for it than id's old shooter. While DOOM essentially had you trudging through large open levels searching for an exit, Marathon gives you tasks that must be completed in order to move forward. These tasks are often simple things -- flip a particular switch, destroy some circuitry -- but add a tad more depth than most shooters from this era. Plus, you can look and aim both horizontally and vertically, which was a considerable improvement over other early first-person shooters.   You also get help from some AI allies. Marines will teleport in at specific points to become fodder for enemy fire. And yes, you can team kill. It's hilarious. Should you want to have some real friends along for the ride, Marathon: Durandal supports four-player split-screen offline and eight-player online co-op. And yes, four people can play split-screen and go online in co-op or multiplayer. On top of all this, you can dual wield shotguns. 'Nuff said.   Your adventure takes you across expansive levels on land, underwater, and even through rivers of lava. Swimming becomes almost as common as running around on land. Whether shooting ugly aliens on land or swimming in search of a secret panel, the controls remain very simple. The right trigger is primary fire, left trigger is secondary fire (or dual-wielded weapon), and A interacts with the environment. The bumpers switch weapons and B is a quick switch to your fists, which can be used to pummel mutants or circuitry panels. That's really all you need to tear through Marathon: Durandal.    He looks just like Master Chief! You'll notice there's no mention of a reload button. That's because, just like the original, you can't manually reload. This means that, quite often, you will need to waste a few rounds to force an auto-reload between battles. It's called ~inventory management,~ but I'm not convinced a reload button shouldn't have been added. Back in the early '90s, developers were a tad naive about things like reload buttons. It's 2007 and we all know a manual reload is standard. Not having it gets a bit frustrating at times, especially if you have played any FPS in the past six or seven years.   For the most part, Marathon: Durandal on XBLA plays much like the original. However, Freeverse made a few tweaks to Bungie's beloved shooter. All of the art assets were redone to provide a much cleaner look and allow for true HD support. Switch to the original graphics and you'll be quickly thankful that Freeverse took the effort to clean things up for the enhanced version.     Marathon now runs at 60 frames per second, where the original Mac version ran at 30. To be honest, this is a little unnecessary. One of the great benefits of 60fps is that you can see more subtleties in animations. Well, Marathon is an old game. Its animations (by today's standards) are crap. The 60fps allows Marathon to run at a lightning speed. You'll be amazed just how quickly you can zip around a level. But that speed also comes at a cost. And that cost is a very rare sensation in videogames -- motion sickness. Because of the tight confines of the levels and the ease in which you can get lost, quite often you may find yourself running about, turning quickly, and watching as the world begins to spin. Though I had a blast playing Marathon, I can't deny that more than once I felt like throwing up. And I'm not the only one. All four IGN editors who played Marathon for more than 15 minutes began to feel ill. In fact, just thinking about the game is starting to bring back my lunch. Funny, I don't remember having chicken.   Even without the motion sickness, there are a few aspects of Marathon that haven't aged well. The enemy AI is pretty abysmal. Often enemies will stand motionless waiting for you to take the first shot. The difficulty increases later in the game not because of tougher enemies, but by adding more of them to each area. Like DOOM, Marathon features open levels you must explore. While this can be enjoyable, there's quite a few times where you will just wander around with no clue where to go next or what you are supposed to do. Though there is a map available, it's not always helpful. This is just one of those kinks in old shooters. But if you hate this aspect, then Marathon: Durandal is certainly not for you.   Split-screen fun can be taken online. If you have a strong stomach and can survive the dizzying aspects of Marathon, you'll find an exceptional game. A little seasickness didn't stop me from powering through one of the longest offerings on XBLA, so most people should be okay so long as they take occasional breaks or some Dramamine.    For those looking to take the game beyond the campaign, there's a lot to enjoy. You can play four-player splitscreen or eight-player System Link or online. The multiplayer modes are the original versions of some Halo classics. Along with Deathmatch and co-op, gamers can tackle King of the Hill, Kill the Man with the Ball, and Tag. There are more than a dozen maps as well. While the multiplayer isn't going to be exciting enough to keep Marathon running on your 360 once Halo 3 arrives in late September, it should provide a nice warm-up during a relatively shooter-free August.  I like Marathon: Durandal a lot. In fact, I think it's quite a bit better than DOOM in almost all aspects. But it's impossible to ignore the fact that everyone who has played Marathon has gotten nauseous. I've never seen this happen with a game before, but obviously anything that leaves people feeling worse than when they booted it up, can't get a very enthusiastic thumbs up.If you have the stomach for it (download the demo to test out your sea legs), then by all means, scoop up Marathon. It's a long, enjoyable campaign with strong multiplayer as an added bonus.", "date": "Jul 31, 2007"}
