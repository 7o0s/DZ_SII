Back in the summer of 2006, in the months leading up to the launch of the Wii, we ran a feature here on IGN called Retro Remix. It was a wishlist/speculation series, each installment of which tried to predict what old-school classics might someday come to the Virtual Console. Bozon wrote the first 15 editions, and I took over starting with the 16th. It was my first article for IGN. I wrote about StarTropics.    So, in my opinion, this year is getting started right  since StarTropics is the one game that first came to my mind to wish for for the Virtual Console almost 18 months ago, the first game that I wanted to write about for IGN. And now it's finally arrived, as the first new downloadable addition to the Wii Shop for 2008.   Why all the hype and fanfare? Because StarTropics is a unique, compelling action/adventure that deserves much more notice than it ever received in its original release during the NES era. It's an in-house, first-party Nintendo design that was developed in Japan specifically to appeal to Western audiences, but never caught on quite enough to earn itself more than a single sequel. And it should have, because it's a great game.   In the overworld, Mike explores the StarTropics archipelago with a zoomed-out, birds-eye perspective.  And a great evolution, really. StarTropics plays in a way that makes it seem like it was the natural evolution of the original Legend of Zelda  you control a young adventurer questing through a series of underground labyrinths, finding new weapons and items and discovering secret passages, taking on big bosses and solving puzzles. There are a lot of similarities. Even your health is measured in hearts, and you expand that meter by finding Heart Containers just like Link would in the fantasy land of Hyrule.   But StarTropics sets itself apart from its obvious inspiration with a unique tropical setting and more modern theme. This game takes place in the ~real world~  the hero, Mike Jones, is a baseball-loving teen from Seattle, and the weapons he finds and equips himself with aren't the traditional action/adventure fare of swords and shields, but rather common pieces of sporting goods equipment like baseball bats and soccer cleats. Your main weapon is the most interesting of all  a yo-yo. A good old-fashioned island yo-yo. (Which is oddly renamed the ~Island Star~ in this VC edition. What, is ~yo-yo~ a trademarked term now?)   You begin the game by receiving that primary element of your arsenal from the Chief of C-Island, who also informs you that your uncle (a famous archaeologist named Dr. Jones) has been abducted by aliens. You set out to rescue him by traveling from island to island in the vast StarTropics archipelago, driving a custom-built submarine, and interacting with the different island residents you meet up with along the way. These overworld exploration sequences are fairly linear, playing out in a way not too dissimilar from the earliest Dragon Warrior games  but there are still quite a few puzzles and mazes to figure out before the game takes you back underground for the next action stage.   There, the viewpoint zooms in on our hero, as Mike walks, jumps and defeats foes face-to-face. The most difficult part of StarTropics to adapt to has to be the relatively stiff control in these action stages  Mike can only move up, down, left or right, and is restricted to moving one ~square~ at a time. As if each room were built out of a grid.   But when the action starts, the viewpoint zooms in to offer more dynamic detail.  Which they literally are, on occasion, when Mike comes across sets of tiles laid out on the ground. You can't walk directly onto these tiles. Instead, you have to jump onto each one, one at a time. Many of the games' puzzles have to do with finding the right tile and jumping on it, which will often activate hidden pressure switches that will then open a locked door or treasure chest.   It takes a bit of a shift in your thinking to adjust to the style, because you just can't run into a room with gung-ho gusto and lay waste to every enemy in StarTropics. You have to be more strategic about your movements, taking time to observe the patterns of your enemies' movements and the timing of any traps and plan your approach accordingly. And solving some rooms' puzzles takes patience and trial and error  the solution to your current situation is often totally obscured, and you'll have to test several tiles and push against seemingly solid walls to find the right way forward.   This more strategic, stiffer approach to Nintendo's Zelda dungeon-exploration gameplay design may be the reason why StarTropics wasn't universally well received in its original release  but I find it compelling. It's a design choice that separates StarTropics from Zelda and makes it more than the recolored clone it could have been, and though you might think Mike's movements are far too restrictive to begin with, after a few minutes it becomes much more natural to control.There's a reason why I chose StarTropics to be the topic of my first ever IGN article a year and a half ago, and a reason why I'm excited that it's now arrived on the Virtual Console  and that's because it's just a great, fun, unique Nintendo game. First-party games developed by Nintendo's own creative teams aren't often overlooked, but StarTropics was. For whatever reason, this title that takes inspiration from the classic original Legend of Zelda design and evolves it into something new and compelling was never noticed by fans as much as it deserved to be. But for just five bucks, you can't make the mistake of passing it by now. Trust me that it's worth your 500 Wii Points and give it a download  because if you play it and enjoy it, your purchase will help motivate the Big N to make StarTropics' lone sequel, Zoda's Revenge, also available in the Wii Shop someday soon. (Not to mention other long-lost cult classics from Nintendo's own first-party catalog, like EarthBound.) Oh, and as a final note, Nintendo seems to have found a creative solution to the ~physical letter problem~ brought up in that Retro Remix feature from 18 months ago  the letter has been recreated inside the game's Virtual Console Operations Guide. You can even ~dunk~ it in water by clicking on a graphic at the bottom of the page with the Wii Remote. Nice touch, Big N.", "date": "Jan 8, 2008"}
