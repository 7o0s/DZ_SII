{"name": "Suikoden 2", "name_review": "Suikoden II", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/27/suikoden-ii", "text": "When the original Suikoden released for PlayStation seemingly years and years ago, gamers were pleased for the most part. A company like Konami, not normally known for RPGs, had make a striking entry into the market with a game that was well-scored, deep in its battle systems and host to a clever character system. With the Rune system and all 108 Stars of Destiny to collect, gamers who were disappointed by the somewhat bland graphics and the short gameplay time were still guaranteed a good time while Suikoden was spinning in their systems.Now, nearly four years later, the sequel to one of the first RPGs on PlayStation has finally come home. A true sequel in nearly every aspect, Suikoden II manages to achieve the rare feat of actually picking up where the former game left off, taking gamers for a familiar ride that proves to be deeper and much more detailed than the original.StorylineAs a member of the Alliance, a military force only really hinted at in the original, you play the unwitting hero of the game: an orphan who has been raised by a quiet, unassuming battle hero in a seemingly ancient war. Alongside you in the ranks is your best friend Joei, a boy born of nobility but who has never been able to receive approval in his stubborn father's eyes. As the game begins, you are immediately tossed into a tale of political strife, betrayal and war on a grand scale beyond your scope in the early stages.But as the game wears on, the plot will twist, turn and develop in numerous ways that really expose the personalities of each of the characters involved. To go further into the actual details would ruin the experience, as told through dialog, action, and some very well wrought cinemas that couple traditional 2D characters with CG-rendered backgrounds.Throughout the game, you discover that this is really a tale of friendship between two childhood chums  there' s no damsel in distress or princess that needs saving. And it's the sincerity of the plot that keeps the game moving and the player involved in all the events and tragedies that transpire. The development of the characters, (including a good portion of the 108 Stars of Destiny!) is also impressive, especially considering the scope of the game and how many characters there are.While the content of the storyline is engrossing and deep, the lackluster translation and the inclusion of more than a few typos threaten to take the shine off an otherwise wonderfully told game. Though this may bug some role-players, the mistakes and fumbles are easily overlooked and won't be difficult to shrug off in the long run.GraphicsWhile detailed, colorful and expressive, the graphics themselves are merely an enhancement on what gamers glimpsed in the original. Two-dimensional sprite characters and 2D backgrounds, there's nothing singularly impressive in Suikoden II, especially in the wake of a game as grandiose as Final Fantasy VIII. But with improved spell effects and an immersive storyline, it's difficult to find flaw in the way that Suikoden II looks -- the characters are startlingly expressive and each object is minutely detailed. If anything, the game serves as a great ode to how well 2D RPGs have survived in the polygonal age.GameplayWith a storyline deeply rooted in many of the aspects of the original, (along with the return of characters from the first game) it's no surprise that the gameplay is also a greatly enhanced throwback to the first Suikoden. The battle system is still turn-based, with the option to equip Runes for special abilities, combine party member attacks to create chain combos or devastating spells, and the excellent option to run the battle in Auto mode for otherwise tedious random battling.The variety of battles has also been enhanced in the strategy segments, which are more akin to those found in games like Shining Force or Master of Monsters, than the rock-paper-scissors brand of battling from the original. The one-on-one battles are still accounted for as well, making the Suikoden series as a whole, much more mottled with variety than most other current RPGs.But in addition to these features, Konami has also implemented a whole host of secrets, sub-missions and side games that were either overly simplified in the first game or absent, entirely. From cooking competitions to dancing contests, there's plenty more for meticulous gamers to seek out and find. And this also includes the return of the 108 Stars of Destiny.Based on an ancient Chinese story, a ragtag army of rebels must call together all 108 Stars of Destiny in order to defeat the evil empire. As the hero, you will run across all sorts of characters that will either join your cause immediately, or will require you to complete different objectives to coax them onto your crew. As always, the result is addicting, challenging and oftentimes frustrating. And often you'll find that the game's otherwise steady pace will slow down to a crawl because of your drive to collect all the fighting partners you can.Though the pace of the game may drag at times, no gamer will be able to complain that there isn't enough to do in Suikoden II. The variety in the battle system, the richness of the storyline and the plethora of secrets to uncover will long outlast any preconceptions that this is as a short game as the original title in the series. Suikoden II manages to take everything that the made the former RPG such a hit, and capitalizes on the fact that most fans want to be coddled with consistency in story, character and gameplay, then delivers what is one of the best RPGs for PlayStation.This has been one of the games that I've been looking forward to for awhile. And I haven't been disappointed. I liked the first Suikoden enough, but it wasn't nearly as memorable simply because its characters never felt as fleshed out as in other RPGs and the length of the game was incredibly short. It seems like Konami felt the same way about the game and turned around to deliver I think is one of the best RPGs of the year. Not only is the game bigger, deeper and more distinct, but I found the whole friendship between Joei and the hero to be so painfully sincere. Yes, it gets a little schmaltzy at times, and there are enough typos to put a sane copy editor in the loony bin, but there's so much to do in this game and such an involving storyline  I was instantly taken in by everything that happened in the game. There are countless aspects to the game that I loved: The way in which you use old Suikoden saves to enable a certain ~event~; the countless references to the original; and the fact that we're actually able to find out what happened to all the characters we grew fond of on the first trip around so many years ago. After all, no fan can say that they weren't curious about Flik or Viktor after the fall of the castle in the original; or what lies at the top of the stairs in the items shop; or who exactly Clive had been chasing through the first game. I could go on and on. But instead, I'll recommend Suikoden II to any RPG fan. Not only the ones who have played through the first game (although, that's a special bonus for all the reasons I stated above), but novices as well. While the game may not move as briskly or look as pretty as something carefully crafted together by Square, I somehow found it even more charming and involving than any of the PlayStation Final Fantasy titles. You may not agree, but I guarantee that you won't find Suikoden II disappointing in the least.", "date": "Oct 27, 1999"}
