This game, based on both the film and book versions, hits in some places and misses in others, but on the whole Electronic Arts and Eurocom put together a second Harry Potter that's a good, fulfilling action adventure. Features More than a dozen hour quest 25 Wizard cards to collect Cartridge save (one slot) Link up with the GameCube game Only for Game Boy Advance Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets basically puts players in the role of the powerful wizard-to-be as he returns to Hogwarts wizard school for his second year. But all is not well, as he's warned by a house elf that he should not return to school because something terrible will happen to him if he does. The game actually doesn't start for the player until his accidental trip to Knock-turn Alley through the use of magical floo powder at the Weasley's place. Early in the game players will have to get some cash from Harry's vault at Gringotts Bank, which is a good first lesson in what to expect from the action and puzzles deeper into the game. After a few tasks grabbing certain items from Diagon Alley, it's off to Hogwarts where the rest of the story unfolds. Chamber of Secrets is more of a ~task~ game than an ~puzzle~ game, as most of the puzzles in the different areas of Hogwarts are so straightforward and simple that it's just a matter of performing the obvious. If you see a switchblock on the floor, for example, there's always a cinder block elsewhere in the room to put there. The action portions are a little better, with decent auto-aiming controls on the standard Flipendo attack spell so players aren't fumbling over trying to hit an enemy on an awkward angle. The few-and-far-between platform levels don't suffer from the isometric perspective...jumping from platform to platform requires a confident control over the diagonal positions on the D-pad, but not once did I goof up a jump. And besides, Harry's indestructible...even if you do take one too many hits, Harry will just restart at the closest save point in the area. The controls can also be switched so that the up/down/left/right points on the D-pad are the on-screen, diagonal equivalent, so no worries there.   About 99% of the game takes place in a 3/4, isometric perspective, giving the game a more detailed look than the GBA version of Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone. Chamber of Secret's graphic engine does its job pretty well with detailed artwork and decent renderings of all the familiar locations established in the movie and books. But it does show a certain ~rough-around-the-edges~ appearance, with strange, flicker effects for fire, explosions, and magical effects, and the scrolling isn't quite as quick or fluid as it could have been; the camera has to chug around to follow Harry around. This sluggish camera shows its face most obviously when Harry has to sneak around Hogwarts without getting caught: the designers realize that the player needs to see as far ahead as possible so Harry won't get caught by other students, Filch or his cat (deducting house points from the overall score), but the ~camera~ doesn't move fast enough to the other direction if Harry need to make a quick, emergency 180.   The designers incorporated a lot of the elements from the books and movie into the game, which should definitely please those purist fans (tens of millions of them, I imagine). 25 Wizard Cards are hidden all over Hogwarts to collect, each with its own artwork and text printed on either side of the card; by collecting five of one type of card, you unlock special options in other parts of the game. Chocolate frogs can be caught throughout the sadventure, giving Harry an extra notch on his health bar for every five collected. And those Every Flavor Beans are hiding around the campus as well...if Harry snags all 100 that are tucked away behind pictures, in bushes, inside vases, drawers, desks, chests, and other places, something ~special~ happens. But even with all of these connections to the book and movie, there seems to be a few missed opportunities; I can't figure out why the designers didn't create a level that let you fly the Ford Anglia to Hogwarts...that would have been a blast.  Quiddich is also in this adventure as a mini-game of sorts. Players can practice up their flying skills before the match in a few challenges, like flying through rings before the clock runs out, or catching a few flutterbys in a set amount of time. The Quiddich match is a variation of both of these flying mini-games, where players much fly through rings to increase their boost power, trying to get to the golden snitch before Malfoy does. These flying levels utilize a basic Mode 7-style engine that isn't quite Pilotwings, but it does its job for a change of pace from the normal adventure. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is obviously (and not surprisingly) aimed at the younger audience, so the game isn't a huge challenge in any real place in the adventure. It is a long adventure, though, with plenty to do, and the developer worked as much Harry Potter magic into the design. Chamber of Secrets is a better game than Sorceror's Stone on the GBA, but it's nothing overwhelming or spectacular; it's just a solid adventure that's a decent GBA title for Harry Potter fans.", "date": "Dec 6, 2002"}
