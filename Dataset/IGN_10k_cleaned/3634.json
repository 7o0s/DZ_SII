Arkanoid may have challenged the throne, but there's just no way to oust Breakout from the collective hearts of old skool vidders 'round the world.  But does this blast from the past survive the journey, especially sans paddle? Features: Classic game play  A fat pile of bricks, a wrecking ball, and an appetite for busting things up.  All that's missing is your mom's orange shag carpet, because booting up Breakout is tantamount to using Mr. Peabody's Wayback Machine.  Great games stand the test of time, and this port of Breakout still passes with flying colors.  Of course, it's hard not to miss the paddle controller.  It made those superfast later rounds a blast, as you ripped that knob clockwise and counter-clockwise, hoping you managed to time the run just right and finish off that pesky final brick.  In this version, you're gonna have to adjust to using the joystick and touchpad, which may take a few games to get a handle on.  However, since the screen is decidedly smaller than a television, you have less ground to cover--and that kinda makes up for it.  Now, it must be mentioned that Breakout is really only Breakout in spirit, as it doesn't exactly look like the old 2600 favorite.  In fact, it looks a little more like Arkanoid, but no matter.  What counts is how it plays, and this revival plays like a champ.  But guess what it does get 100% right?  The sound.  Each different color brick has it's own tone, so if you manage to get the ball trapped at the top and bouncing around, you're treated to that sweet symphony of destruction. Ah, sweet memories of playing Breakout with my old man on the 2600.  The paddle is sorely missed, but the game compensates nicely with the decreased playing field.  The graphics aren't exactly 2600-perfect (which would have been quite cool), but they certainly get the job done and a primitive soundtrack actually works for once.  If you still have love for this golden oldie, bring it to your phone now.  A classic, time-tested diversion done right.", "date": "May 5, 2003"}
