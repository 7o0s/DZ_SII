Digital Eclipse tries its hand a second time on the sports game, and it's obvious that a different team was put on the project than the version last year  the original Game Boy NFL Blitz definitely wasn't much to write home about, but compared to 2000, that game was a programming miracle.  NFL Blitz 2000 is as close to being an unplayable game as you can get on the portable. Complete garbage? You betcha. Features  Multiple camera angles Digitized speech Updated rosters Only for Game Boy Color    Blitz was all about being over the top  the design is a seven-on-seven, quick-and-dirty, no-holds-barred game of violent football with no fouls. Just get the ball down the field and score a touchdown using any means necessary. Half the fun was the brutal nature  late hits, over-the-top tackles, and super fast action. That's what Blitz is. That's what Game Boy Blitz 2000 isn't.  The Game Boy game is still a seven-on-seven game of football. That doesn't stray from the formula. But the rest does  the Game Boy can't really do 3D perspectives, so the developers made the viewpoint up in the air, completely flat. What's bad about this is simple  you can't chuck the ball in the air. The football always stays on the same level as the character sprites, and even if the ball does flow over the pack, you can never really tell when it can since the ball has no shadow. You can switch between side scrolling or vertical scrolling, neither of which work in Blitz 2000. The original Blitz had the right idea, it was just hard to control. This game both looks and plays horribly. It's like the development team learned nothing from the company's first portable try with the series. This version is supposed to be Color-only, but there's nothing here that shows off the extra ~oomph~ of the faster Game Boy Color processor.  What else makes this game unplayable? How about the horrid AI of the offense and defense? The players follow the set paths you select for them during the play, and that's all they'll ever do. They won't avoid being caught in a pack, and they won't avoid tackles. It's unbelievable how many times you'll get sacked behind the line of scrimmage, simply because the defenders go right after your quarterback, easy as pie.   Yeah, but it can't be all bad, right? Well, other than the clean digitized audio between plays, yes it can. The in-between graphics are just as ugly, if not more so, than the actual gameplay. There isn't even a link-cable mode so you can play against a buddy. And no late hits or violent tackles? Bah...bad marks all around.   I don't know what else to say about this atrocity with the Blitz name attached to it. In every category except sound, this game looks like it was rushed to market, without even looking at the arcade version as a model. Yes, the original Blitz on the Game Boy wasn't great either (and yeah, I know we missed reviewing it the first time around  it's one of those backlogged reviews), but if you absolutely must have a Blitz, get the first one. Otherwise, get Madden 2000 from THQ to scratch that football itch.", "date": "Dec 18, 1999"}
