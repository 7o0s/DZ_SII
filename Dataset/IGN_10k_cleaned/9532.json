Features  More than 10 classic Bust-A-Move characters with different attributes, such as Bub, Develon, Alkanet, Marino, Kurol, Tam-Tam, Cleon, G, Bramb and Gigant. Hidden characters. Puzzle, Vs. CPU and Challenge modes. Compatible with Game Boy and Game Boy Color.    The Bust-A-Move series is definitely not about evolution. Since Taito published the first title in the series years ago, the gameplay has virtually remained the same. Basically, players launch bubbles from the bottom of the screen to the top and try to align three bubbles of the same color to erase them. Once the wall of bubbles reaches the bottom, the game ends.  In addition to special ~Balance Fields~, weight scales with pulleys that appear during certain rounds, Bust-A-Move 4 features a number of special bubbles to liven up the gameplay. Star Bubbles eliminate same color bubbles as the launched one; Rainbow Bubbles will change colors; Jama-Blocks (~jama~ is Japanese for ~hindrance~) cannot be popped, only dropped; Fulcrum Blocks can only be erased if all attached bubbles are eliminated; Anti-Gravity Blocks try to float upwards, along with any other bubbles attached to them.  There are three gameplay modes:  Puzzle requires you to clear the screen and doesn't depend at all on which one of the classic BAM characters you have selected.  Player Vs. CPU pits players in 16 split-screen matches against the computer. Beating the computer unlocks hidden characters.  Challenge Mode evaluates players based on how well they play and how far they can get.   Like every other Bust-A-Move game out there, BAM 4 is easy to pick up and highly addictive. Controls and game speed are spot on, but less than favorable use of color for the bubbles makes them a bit hard to tell apart. Developer Crawfish should have realized that it's more important to have recognizable colors for the bubbles than color variety on the characters on screen or the walls. As with its console counterparts, BAM 4 displays the franchise's cute characters all throughout the action, working the bubble launching controls toward the bottom of the screen.   Music and sound effects are nothing spectacular, but fit the puzzle action just right. Sadly, everyone's favorite ~bakaaaaak!~ sound is nowhere to be found, and neither is the series' best feature: the multiplayer mode. C'mon folks, how much work is it to add a simple link-up mode, especially in light of the existing vs. CPU split-screen mode? I've been looking forward to a decent portable Bust-A-Move for a while and BAM 4 fits the bill just right. Apart from the disappointing lack of a two-player mode (why, Acclaim, why?) and the weak use of color, Bust-A-Move 4 plays almost as well as its console and arcade competition. It would have been nice if the puzzle creation mode of BAM '99 (along with link-up/swap and print-out capabilities) had also been included -- but even without all the extra stuff, BAM 4 is just the right entertainment for a long trip. Let's just hope this is the last single-player conversion of a classic multiplayer hit we see from Acclaim...", "date": "Jul 9, 1999"}
