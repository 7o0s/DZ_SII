{"name": "The Muppets: On With the Show!", "name_review": "Muppets: On with the Show", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/03/20/muppets-on-with-the-show", "text": "Even though it feels like the whole Muppets thing died when Jim Henson passed on more than a decade ago, apparently some companies still feel that the license holds some merit for the kiddies. Muppets: On with the Show! is the Game Boy Advance's second game to feature the branding, following Digital Eclipse's and NewKidCo's Muppet Pinball. Unlike the timeless and ageless pinball design of last year's Muppets GBA game, On With the Show is strictly a kids' game. The mini-games, while fun little diversions, are really basic designs intentionally aimed at the younger crowd. That said, the game isn't a bad little game for its target audience...but old-school Muppet fans and experienced gamers shouldn't expect a whole lot of deep gameplay. Features Eight mini-games (two unlockable) Password save Only for Game Boy Advance Muppets: On with the Show, developed by Vicarious Visions (insert obligatory Tony Hawk GBA series reference here), is a group of eight mini-games wrapped around a plot that resembles an entire episode of the original Muppet Show. Each of the games features a specific muppet in the lead, in a challenge that fits that character's style and personality. In Kermit's level, he has to sail the cardboard rapids while playing the banjo, avoiding other floating Muppets (and most importantly, Miss Piggy). As the Swedish Chef, gamers play a little whack-a-rat with Rizzo and his cronies before they steal all of the food on the table. Gonzo hops aboard his scooter, with the player maneuvering him into haystacks and balloons while avoiding walls and other hazards. Or, grab a set of drumsticks and play along with the band as Animal in a Dance Dance Revolution-style game of Simon Says. Rescue Kermit from an oversized porker (har-har) as Miss Piggy, and save Professor Bunsen Honeydew's invention as Beaker. Two other games are locked, so you'll have to score big points on the six to unlock 'em.  The game designs of all of the eight challenges aren't very elaborate, but they're decent for what they are: mini-games. When players complete a challenge in a specific difficulty level, they can play that mode whenever they want without having to go through the story mode. The art style of the game features a really good amount of animation frames per sprite thanks to the pre-rendered graphics, but the cutscenes between the levels are a bit on the stiff side since only their mouths move in a looping animated cycle.  The only real problem that can be said about On with the Show: it's a budget title, so it features a password (only five characters long) to save the game's progress. That we can accept. However, the game doesn't keep the last password earned in memory, so if players skip past the screen that offers their keyword to that particular area, they can't pull it up anywhere else in the game...not even as the default password on the options screen. Not so good. There's no question that the game design in On with the Show is aimed at the younger gaming crowd, since the challenges are extremely basic and offer very little challenge for the experienced gamer. It's cool that the game pays homage to a lot of the little things that happen on the Muppet Show (like the Statler and Waldorf comments from the balcony), so there's at least something here for the older folks who grew up with the show. But honestly, this is for the kids. And it's a decent one for that group...it's just not one for the die-hard Game Boy gamer.", "date": "Mar 20, 2003"}
