But most of that cover of it cling with tenacity. It's just hard to make huge leaps forward when gamers are so used to seeing things a certain way. But sometimes you get a game that takes the basic idea and simply refines it a little... and it's still a bunch of fun. I'm always looking for something new. I like new things. I wish there were more of them. But when it comes down to it, Act of War: Direct Action from Eugen Systems is an entertaining gaming experience, even without extreme innovation. There really isn't a whole lot here that we haven't seen before, but mission design is fun and art (especially in cities) is fantastic. This here is a very good package.   Anybody that took part in EA LA's last entry into the Command & Conquer series, Generals, will note plenty of similarities with Eugen Systems' Act of War. Some of the units look the same, each faction has a ~super weapon~ that can be brought to bear (though they aren't quite as spectacularly over the top as the ones in Generals), terrorists have underground troop movement, the three factions have varying degrees of advanced technologies, and so on.   I can't help but feel this sense of repetition, but considering the fun I've had, does it really matter? Missions are designed well, pacing is good, there is a great selection of units available (some with multiple and optional uses), and combat is exciting enough, thanks to great visuals and sound, that I've yet to be bored.   Act of War is definitely a traditional real-time strategy game, but there are a couple of things that set it apart. The first is the way resources are handled. The first line of resources come from the placement of an oil derrick, which was the most straight forward and recognizable. Once you get the derrick up and a refinery built next to it, they simply need protection and the money will flow in without even thinking about it.    The second type, more suitable for the city settings found all throughout the game, has players generating cash by taking over bank buildings by garrisoning troupes inside. It's basically siphoning cash from the bank... which is pretty messed up for anyone that has money in the bank, but so be it. The challenge here is taking the building and keeping it safe. Even though units have to be garrisoned inside, they're still pretty vulnerable. Enemy infantry can enter the building, fight them on the inside, and take over (if there are enough invaders). At the same time, vehicles can come from outside and kick the crap out of the building itself in order to kill the men inside. But it's much harder that way and becomes quickly apparent that there's a serious need for infantry here where most games fail to create that need to have them around later in a match. These city battles are pretty awesome because of their close combat nature (though there are actually slight problems which I'll get into in a second) so it's nice that the developers helped focus the action there.     Lastly, money can be earned through capturing prisoners. Out on the battlefield, infantry or vehicle pilots will often be wounded or left without a ride. At that point, they may be captured as prisoners of war. A money reward is immediate for those captured, but a gradual reward for holding those prisoners in the faction holding cell (hospital, prison, or field intelligence center) will be gained every little while. The more prisoners, the higher the cash flow. It pays to spare lives in Act of War. Of course, it also means that extracting wounded soldiers and vehicle pilots is much more important. You don't want to leave money just lying around for your opponents to gather. I can tell you it's friggin' maddening to have your opponent capture some of your men in multiplayer, knowing that they not only removed some of your troops but also made money off of it.    The other thing that makes Act of War especially interesting and sometimes frustrating are the incredibly dense and detailed city sectors. Not only do these settings look absolutely freakin' great, but they provide some different challenges. As I mentioned earlier, because of these buildings, infantry becomes especially important. As far as I could tell, there's no unit cap here (at least not that I could reach), so it'll quickly become habit to stick various types of infantry in the homes and office buildings around these cities. Suddenly, armor lines coming down a street are much more vulnerable than they have been in previous RTS titles. Similarly, helicopters running recon down streets might also come face to face with anti-air soldiers hanging out on a roof. It adds a whole new tense feeling that you're about to get crapped on by a bunch of trigger happy enemies. Absolutely lovely.   The problem with these beautifully dense environments is that it can be pretty tricky to see what's happening inside a city. I suppose that's part of the nature of the combat, but it's pretty frustrating to have half of your view blocked by a large set of buildings. They've done a pretty good job alleviating that most of the time, but players are definitely going to have to take serious control of the camera to get the best view of the action and select appropriate tactical targets.   RTS balancing issues will always find their way to the front after the hardcore RTSers start battling it out online. What I see here is a very good base. There are a few things that seem relatively unbalanced when playing through the campaign, but resources are much more limited in multiplayer games. I had originally thought that defense would be too powerful but was proven horribly wrong in one match. Yet another match proved that my theory that weapons of mass destruction were too powerful could go either way. Each side has defense against WMDs that can be used pretty effectively. The key here is that both the offensive super weapons and base defenses have upkeep involved in them. Each time a patriot missile shoots a nuke down, the missile has to be replaced as does the nuke. Both take time. Careful placement of defenses and careful timing of WMDs can make the difference. There are sure to be holes in the balancing (there always are) but on the whole, everything seems to be tested and balanced pretty tightly.     It's also worth mentioning that multiplayer and skirmish will probably be fairly important to folks simply because the single player portion of the game isn't particularly long. I strongly recommend that veteran RTS players increase the difficulty to Special Forces (very hard) as Regular Army (marked as hard) didn't provide an especially impressive challenge.   Outside of direct gameplay issues, Act of War presents the modern warfare setting with mixed results. Menus and interface are generally pretty darn good. The in game interface is pretty standard aside from the extra annoying window that pops up to block a quarter of the screen when something important happens. And while much of the emphasis on publicity of the game has been put on the live action scenes and story based on Dale Brown fiction, the real winner here is the city art. The development team has managed to create some fantastic visuals of San Francisco and especially Washington D.C.. Both the White House and capitol building are replicated perfectly. It's actually pretty eerie rolling up the mall towards the capitol while trying to save our country from political destruction.   Of course, the fact that you're rolling down the lawn to take out a huge armed force in the nation's capitol is a bit ridiculous. The story actually has some good moments points in between unbelievability punctuated by a crazy president, egomaniacal bad guy, transparent plot twists, and careless destruction of US cities.     Now, as you may have noticed, the days of live action movies in games seemed to be pretty much behind us as game engines have become good enough to handle the load from both a technical and artistic standpoint. Some would argue this to be a good thing while others find some sense of comfort in seeing real people acting out a video game drama in-between action points. Eugen Systems and Atari were betting that there were more people missing the real people than not. For the part of the genre, the RTS is definitely the place to use this stuff as engines don't render extremely life-like human models quite yet (give it a few years). So if you want any kind of character interaction, live action is probably the way to do it.   Eugen Systems combined the two forms of cutscne well to create both a story that could be presented on a character level as well as intersperse some special effects using the in-game engine. The in-game shots are pretty action packed and put in useful places. They serve to set the mood and frantic pace of the level to come. The movie shots are frequent and pretty large. They even went so far as to add a prequel type scene to the game during the install sequence, which is nice. The only problem is, if you're one of those people that simply starts things and walks away, there's no way to access it in the actual game.    The tricky thing about using footage like this is making it good. And as Act of War shows, halfway decent production can't save bad acting. Almost every actor used in the film footage of Act of War is sub-par. The Russian bad guy is laughable as is his accent, but you never get the sense that this is supposed to be a totally corny story, as was the case with the Red Alert games. Consequently the accent just grates on your nerves, as does that guy's horrible ~I'm sneering at you condescendingly~ look that looks more like he's trying to dislodge something stuck in his teeth. The American general is also worth having a laugh at while you're at it. I've never seen a high ranking officer care so little about his authority being flouted or his troops being killed.     Still... even with the obvious lack of budget compared to... well, any kind of motion picture, this was a nice change of pace from the seeing only digital people for so long. Sure, it could have been better (you'll notice some things that are just plain stupid), but it was still entertaining and that's the overall goal here. As I said before, Act of War: Direct Action is a very solid gaming package. While the single player campaign was relegated to the American viewpoint and a tad bit on the brief side, it was a fun experience while there. Units seem to be well balanced, combat is fun and made pretty interesting by dense city sections, and the visuals should keep anybody more than satisfied. The story is actually a bit wonky (though it's hard to tell whether it's simply a product of being dumbed down for a video game or simply poorly conceived) and acting in the cut scenes is sometimes reminiscent of watching a third grade play, the experience as a whole is more than the sum of its parts.
