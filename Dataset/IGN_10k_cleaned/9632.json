Whereas most movie-licensed games tend to fall flat on their face and bear little resemblance to the material that inspired them, Tarzan on the Game Boy does the enjoyable Disney movie justice in every way. Programmed and designed by the small California development house Digital Eclipse, the Color-only cart pushes the envelope in both the graphics and sound department and has solid gameplay mechanics to boot.  Features  23 stages. Play as different characters from the Disney movies. Digitized drum beats. ~FMV~ Scenes. Two-player hide and seek mode. Supports Game Boy Printer. Password Saving. Only for Game Boy Color.   The Game Players start off as young Tarzan as they explore a scrolling jungle environment in search of bananas. The first thing you will notice is the game's fast pace and amazingly fluid animation. Much like Aladdin on the Genesis, Tarzan moves about with the same Disney smoothness, exhibiting all the motion patterns and mannerisms of the animated movie character. Since he was raised amongst gorillas, Tarzan exhibits an unusual array of moves  and he'll need them to get through the game's 23 stages. Next to running, jumping and swimming, Tarzan can also hang on to certain platforms from the side or even from below and jump up on top of them. Depending on the stage you're in, he can also bounce on top of hippos or grab a hold of vines and swing around, well, Tarzan-style.   The actual gameplay can hardly be called original. Each stage has you hunting for a preset number of bananas while avoiding contact with jungle baddies, like baboons, warthogs, fish, crocs, birds and of course the movie's two primary villains, Sabor the leopard and Clayton the hunter. Once you collect all the bananas, you can stay in the level and look for hidden ones to get a perfect score, or you can end the stage by meeting up with your buddy. To add a bit of variety, the game eventually alternates between the characters, letting players not only control young Tarzan, but also Terk, and later on Jane and grown-up Tarzan.  Despite the inclusion of a few bonus stages, the game runs low on variety in the earlier stages. However, the seeming effortless agility and speed with which Tarzan and co can navigate through their environments that keeps it fun to play at all times and will keep you going. Although there is no two-player mode per se, Digital Eclipse added a very innovative ~Hide 'n' Seek~ feature that has one player hide somewhere in the jungle, then hand over the Game Boy to player 2 for time-limited seeking. Especially younger players will appreciate this thoughtful feature that adds more interactivity to a genre mostly confined to single-player gameplay.  The amount of work the developers put into the game to make it as authentically ~Tarzan~ as possible is evident everywhere. Take for example, the opening sequences, which convey the movie's storyline through a series of animated stills, culminating in a brief but impressive FMV sequence taken directly from the film. If you thought FMV couldn't be done on Game Boy, take a look. You'll be pleasantly surprised. In addition to the opening, there is plenty of artwork to keep kids and Disney fans happy. As an added bonus, there is even a print shop feature called Paint 'n' Print that enables Tarzan owners to create pictures using backgrounds and character stamps and then print everything on the Game Boy Printer.  In the sound department, Tarzan avoids the pitfalls of midi-style jungle beats a la Turok Game Boy and goes with streaming samples. The low-fidelity samples aren't very long, but clever use of fill-ins and ambient background audio (like bird calls) makes it sound as if you're dealing with an interactive score. Impressive stuff. Tarzan, which earned our Game of the Month Award for the month of June, is the perfect example of a licensed game done right. Not only does it look and sound like the movie it's based on, it succeeds in replicating the feel of Disney's Tarzan to a tee. I would have liked to see more variety in the tasks and level backgrounds (and the collision detection is a little unforgiving when you're trying to grab 1-ups), but those are small quibbles considering the solid gameplay, long quest and wealth of features. A must-have platformer that shows off what Game Boy Color can do.", "date": "Jul 14, 1999"}
