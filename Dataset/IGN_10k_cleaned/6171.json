The only thing can could sink Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2005 3D would be if Gameloft somehow subverted the great gameplay through the addition of polygons, but judging from a hot-handed play test with the new game, no such fate has befallen what is by far the best baseballer on handsets today.   There's just no discounting how playable Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2005 3D truly is. You have control over pretty much every facet of the game. When you step up to the plate, you can choose from four types of hits, such a grounders or a power shot at right field. If you hit the ball, you use number keys to run the bases. If you have multiple baserunners, you can use the ~7~ key to advance everybody. Depending on how smart the computer is (which you assign), you cannot be too risky with runners. Hesitate in taking a base and the basemen will be all over you. If I have only one small gripe, it's that I was able to get a lot of hits. I like action in a baseball game as much as the next guy, but some innings seemed a little out of hand.   Pitching is also a gas. Using the d-pad or number keys, you choose from four pitches available to each pitcher. Then using the number keys, you can ~aim~ the ball. Finally, it's time to run the power meter for both strength and accuracy, and let 'er rip. Should the batter connect, you have complete control over fielding -- which is something you don't see in many other mobile baseball games.   But just describing the controls and options isn't enough. There is a certain ~feel~ to Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2005 3D that is hard to really put your thumb on. This game plays. You know how when you load up game and you just sorta hit a groove with it? Or when you're watching a DVD that strikes you ~just right?~ That's what's going on here in Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2005 3D. This is a mobile game that coulda been a console contender.   Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2005 3D fires up with a nice round of ~Y'all Ready For This?~ (hells yeah!) that segues into a rousing version of ~Take Me Out the the Ballgame.~ From then on in, you are bombarded with quality production values. Calls are accompanied by speech, the crowd roars when you perform a stellar play, classic stadium jingles play in heavy rotation, and the crack of the bat cracks hard and true.   Aural pleasure aside, Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2005 3D also wows with a rock solid graphics engine. The players are composed of a good number of polygons. Sure, there are some jaggies and whatnot -- but this is first gen 3D. What really smoothes things out are the animations, which look fantastic. That dead sprint for first, the catch of a pop fly cradled to the ground, the celebratory home run -- all superb. There are crowd animations, high-fives with players coming up to bat, and clapping third base coaches. Outrageous.  Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2005 3D is an absolute gotta-have for gamers with 3D handsets. (I played it on an LG VX8100.) This title will quickly enter rotation as a game I use to try and convince friends it's time to upgrade from their raggedy-old handsets. The look, sound, and feel of the game simply cannot be beat right now. Gameloft has truly outdone themselves with this superlative sports title. The bar has been kicked straight up in the air and I hope the rest of the development community working on 3D games takes notice.", "date": "Oct 18, 2005"}
