The Golden Tee arcade machine is always a great time if you don't mind the smell of stale beer and some obnoxious drunks giving you tips on how to play when you trot over to your local tavern to drop some quarters. Mario Golf was a great title, but tough to take seriously when a foursome consists of a fairy princess, a baby plumber, a well dressed ape and a.....Yoshi. To bring golf back to a reality that it hasn't experienced since the days of Waialea Country Club, Infogrames brings us PGA European Tour, a game that proves to be the biggest reach of all.   P> The Facts:  Full European PGA License. Four authentic courses including Quinta do Lago, Druids Glen, Kungsangen and The K Club in Ireland. Commentary by BBC Announcers Peter Allis and Alex Ray. Tour mode simulates a full PGA Europe season. Strokeplay, Matchplay, Skins and Practice Game modes. Pick up-and-play Quickstart mode. Choice of playing styles including Singles, Four Ball and Foursomes.   Gameplay Timing your button pushing to get proper power and accuracy to your shot has been the way of golf games since the beginning of time it seems. European Tour steals a page out of CyberTiger's book by offering players analog stick swing control in addition to the standard timed A-button pushing. You actually have the option of adjusting the timed button pushing control scheme as well. Neither the 2 click nor the 3 click, as they're called, swing mechanisms will make the game any easier, and it seems that it will just be a matter of preferences for players who decide to pick this game up.   And if you do decide to pick up European Tour, you'd better clear you schedule. Golf games are time consuming by nature, but championship mode in the Infogrames game is a monster. You start of as an amateur and you'll have to become a pro before you can even play with the big boys. Turning pro means becoming a scratch golfer --reducing your handicap to 0. Once you turn pro you'll earn your spot on the Challenge Tour. Once you finish in the top 8 on the Challenge Tour, you'll earn a spot in the European Qualifying school. If you finish among the top 8 at Q-school, then finally, after all of that hard work, you'll end up on the European Tour. Your reward for making it to the Tour is an all out battle with 40 of the greatest players over seven events. All of this is to make the point of how much of this game you'll have to play before you get to the experience that you're promised on the backside of the box.   ~Compete in European Tour~ sound like fun. ~Play this game for a week before you see any names that you'll recognize~ does not.   We can certainly appreciate the realism Infogrames Sheffield House is trying to include in the game, because those exhaustive repetitve rounds of golf is exactly what it takes for real life players to turn pro, but this is a videogame. Videogames, should be fun as soon as possible. Playing as and against your favorite European golfers --if you're interested in this game, you should have at least one favorite-- is a promise that the championship mode should fulfill immediately, not after countless rounds of squinting through bad graphics and poor everything else.   Graphics They're bad. During the course of gameplay you can recognize that there are men hitting white balls around green environments with sticks. That's about it. The game is so blurry and poorly animated that you can barely make out the shimmering blobs of color that make up the players, balls and courses.   There has been a debate around IGN64 over whether or not this game is actually in 3D. The horrible polygonal player models actually couldn't confirm this so we were reduced to looking at the cross-poly trees that line the different courses to come to the conclusion that European Tour is a 3D videogame. The trees represent the time honored technique on the N64 where a tree is made up of one two dimensional tree shaped piece of geometry intersecting an exact replica of itself at the midpoint. From most angles --except directly above where it would look like a ~+~-- the tree looks 3D. When you hit your ball into the trees, just close your eyes.  The players themselves seem to be a loose confederation of colored dots. If you remember the movie ~Candyman~, where the main character's body was made of living honeybees moving together in human form, that's what European Tour reminds us of.  If only we could say Jose Maria Olazabal's name three times in the mirror so he could come put us out of our misery with a rusty 9 iron.   You know a game has bad graphics when there are absolutely no close-ups of the characters.... ever .....  at all...... in the entire game. The camera stays a static 30-50 yards or meters away from the players during your shot. The guys look bland and lifeless at those distances as it is. There's not telling what horrors we might find with a closer look.   As far as animation goes, everything gets uglier when the game actually starts to move. Sluggish framerate should not be a problem in a golf game.  Sound One of the endearing features of European Tour is supposed to be the true to life sounds of the golf course. Birds and wind, we believe are the exact examples Infogrames uses. The bird and wind sound effects are outstanding and sound very realistic.   The problem is if you expect to hear anything else in European Tour, you're going to be disappointed. There's no gallery, that would require more polygonal people and that's not going to happen, and absolutely nothing else during the course of gameplay that would make noise. With nothing else to listen to in European Tour, the birds and wind have to carry the audio load and that's just not enough variety for us. Since we can't see the birds or wind anyway, why not throw in a few rowdy American hecklers or even golfer comments? We don't have to see the Americans or see the golfer's lips move.  We almost forgot, the BBC's Peter Allis is the featured commentator in PGA European Tour. Uhhhhh. Yeah. You're better off tuning him out in favor of listening to the birds and weather over and over again. They're much more interesting and timely. This game isn't fun at all. I don't know if it should be commended for capturing the boredom and stodginess of the real European Tour or ridiculed for taking up valuable shelf space, plastic and ink. It does have the European Tour license and that includes all of the genuine courses, most of which we'll never get to play. But what's the point  of having Quinto do Lago in the game if it looks as crappy and blurry as the local municipal course down the street. Golf is a refined sport where the beauty of the surroundings is as important as the game itself. We can't help but conclude that PGA European Tour was unsuccessful in its struggle to be refined, beautiful and a game itself.", "date": "Jun 13, 2000"}
