Each title - spanning a different console - contained the same basic gameplay; select your player, run right, and beat the crap out of everything.  Both games included tons of smashable items that produced an array of weaponry, food items, and unnecessary sacks of money, jewels, and/or gold bars.  Since the Wii is now home to both the Nintendo and SEGA camps, you may or may not remember either of these franchises, but you can be damn sure that as long as both Capcom and SEGA have half a brain you'll be seeing both of the series getting a full revitalization on the Wii Virtual Console.    While Final Fight players were mashing the Super NES gamepads, SEGA loyalists had the Streets of Rage series.  SEGA's goal; steal some of the thunder from Capcom's famous arcade franchise, capitalizing on one of Final Fight's odd omissions.  For whatever reason, the Super Nitnendo version of Final Fight included no two player mode, and while the game is still regarded as a tighter, faster, more complete title than the original Streets of Rage, the included multiplayer mage Rage a series that console fans got behind in a hurry, and soon catapulted into one of SEGA's bread-n-butter franchises over the lifespan of Genesis.             If you're a long-time fan of Genesis, or fancied yourself a brawler fan back in the day, chances are you've already downloaded and ripped through Streets of Rage before reading this review.  The game has a huge nostalgia factor to it, it's a name that most retro fans know, and it's a series that has become immortalized despite its many flaws.  Still, $8 bucks is a decent amount of cash to plop down, and the experience - while still very entertaining - may end up being less of an action-packed slugfest than you remember.   For starters, Streets of Rage is showing some serious age in the gameplay department.  The game follows the same one-button combos as so many of the other arcade brawlers out there, as well as auto-grabbing by simply walking up to an enemy.  Adding a bit of depth the combat, players can either beat on a grabbed enemy, flip over them by pressing the jump button (which sets them up for the classic suplex move), or chuck them into fellow enemies by holding away from the enemy and tapping the attack button.  Aside from that, there really isn't a ton left to do.  Breaking barrels, telephone booths, or the oh-so-familiar wooden crates will yield weapons such as broken bottles, knives, iron pipes, or baseball bats, which can be brandished until dropped or depleted from overuse.  Players looking for a health boost can also find delicious apples or good ole chunks of meat to munch on as well.  In general though, the overall gameplay is slower than it needs to be, and lacks the quicker snap-to animations that the Final Fight franchise (as well as the later Streets of Rage games) use to keep the combat quick and articulate.   As with any other brawler out there, Streets of Rage is only as much fun as you make it, so while you're constantly fighting the same dozen or so enemies throughout the eight levels, and battling recycled bosses over and over, there's still a simple charm to it.  Adding another player into the mix helps a ton, and even opens the door for multiple endings.  The multiple difficulty levels also help extend the life of the game, but when you're bashing the same old characters over and over there's really not too many ways of creating substantial lasting appeal.  The main game will take anywhere from a half hour to 45 minutes depending on the difficultly level, and only diehard brawler fans will stick around for much longer than that.   Now 16 years after its initial release, Streets of Rage is definitely a mixed bag of presentation and gameplay.  While its the first in a legendary trilogy of brawlers, the games combat is slower and clunkier than fans may remember, and the adventure  while still pretty fun  may not hold up to your memories of the game.  Streets of Rage is an awesome title if youve never ripped through the franchise before now, but with the knowledge of its successors (particularly Streets of Rage III), its hard to go back to the original.  The graphical presentation is just a notch higher than Sega Master System, the audio is generic and offers only extremely short snippets of digitized voice samples, and the amount of reused assets (enemies and bosses specifically) cuts the lasting appeal short.  Still, Streets of Rage is an awesome chunk of history for both the SEGA Genesis and the brawler genre, and if youve already invested in a pair of classic controllers  and have a friend thats into beat-em-ups as well  Streets of Rage should last you at least a few entertaining hours.  For the more conservative VC shopper out there, you may want to hold out for the sequels which are undoubtedly on the way.", "date": "Feb 20, 2007"}
