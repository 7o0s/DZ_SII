Therefore, I have a special appreciation for the Jagged Alliance series by Sir Tech. Aside from the original X-Com, competent, turn-based, infantry games have been naught; anyone raising their hand to suggest Microprose's, err.. Hasbro's, I mean Infogrames' recent aberration: Squad Leader should be flogged, just turn off your computer and dump it into the nearest body of water. Those unfamiliar with Jagged Alliance have missed out on one of the richest PC gaming experiences in any genre. Boastful? Yes. Deserved? Read on.  Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business (JA2:UB) is the fourth iteration in the series and is presented as a stand-alone product. Unfortunately it has languished for the last six months in search of a publisher. Interplay has wisely opted to pick up the contract and ex-grunts like myself hope this bodes well for the future. Unfinished Business is more an extension than a sequel. The game engine is largely identical to that which debuted in Jagged Alliance 2 last summer, though it has been embellished with a number of modest modifications to impressive effect. The result is a more streamlined effort that emphasizes interaction with your handpicked team of mercenaries, rather than miring you beneath the economic and social details of its predecessor.    Unfinished Business is a meditation on efficiency, providing only the narrowest pretense to get you into combat. No lengthy or contrived CGI intro here, just a simple storyline told through Emails via a simulated laptop interface. You have been contracted to hire a small military force to intercede in the continuing conflicts of a fictional banana republic named Arulco. Given thirty-five thousand dollars and access to several fictional ~mercenary-for-hire~ Web sites your task is to liberate the besieged nation by force of arms.   JA2:UB certainly does not overwhelm with gameplay options. Multiplayer is absent and there are no skirmish, random or quick mission generators. There is simply a single player campaign comprised of two primary modes of play: ~Start Fresh~ and ~Iron Man~. Both allow you to assemble a new team of mercs and begin the single player campaign. In Iron Man mode you cannot save during combat or while enemies are present on the current map. Be forewarned, the early game is very unforgiving to untested squads and while difficulty levels are configurable at the beginning of the campaign they are not adjustable thereafter. This can lead to moments of head-slamming anguish when your team is reduced to a bunch of lumbering zombies three or four tactical encounters later. Fortunately, veteran players of JA2 may import saved games and characters, which is pretty much the only way to survive the Iron Man mode.   The designers of Unfinished Business have take great pains to populate the game world with reams of authentic weapons, accurately depicted ordnance, and the best cover and concealment simulation this side of the pentagon. New features, such as a range finder allows accurate determination the effective range of a weapon before firing as well as other hot keys that provide needed intelligence regarding fields of fire and cover zones. Each is very useful and all are welcome additions. Yet, despite these efforts to improve gameplay one major discrepancy remains; a dubious hallmark throughout the Jagged Alliance series. The base arsenal for each merc is generally a woeful selection of short-range popguns and bludgeoning devices, most not much more impressive than a Saturday Night Special. This seriously unbalances the early game in favor of the enemy and otherwise detracts from the illusion of realism. Fortunately, better arms may be obtained by rubbing out the enemy forces. Their weapons, equipment and ammo are often left intact.   The overall campaign is won by securing villages and strategic facilities, such as prisons and factories, across the map of Arulco, which is divided into roughly 20 distinct quadrants. Each map may contain upwards of ten or twenty enemy soldiers positioned inside of buildings or patrolling about. While the average enemy soldier is capable of sniping the lit end of a cigarette at ninety paces on a breezy day your highly priced mercs will struggle to score a single hit using automatic weapons at ranges inside of a city block. I respect that the game engine is taking into account individual marksmanship ratings, fatigue, weapon accuracy and body posture. But if anyone at Sir Tech can explain how a merc with a marksmanship score of 90 (out of 100) employing a scoped sniper rifle from a kneeling position can't nail a soldier standing in the open more than one time in five I would be impressed. In under three weeks the US Army can take nearly anyone off the street and train them to fire a 1960's era M-16 rifle and consistently hit a pop up silhouette at 300 meters, all while a drill sergeant calls you a moron and kicks dirt down the back of your neck. [ed. guh?]  Consequently, at times the odds are so outlandishly stacked in favor of the enemy that you would probably have better success betting the under in a bowl game between the Nebraska and Northern Idaho Technical College. I appreciate a good challenge as much as anyone, but the Arulco military seems to be teeming with expert infantryman while your crack teams of hired thugs were apparently plucked from security assignments at K-Mart and Big Lots.   The terrain, object and unit graphics in JA2:UB are depicted in a colorful 16-bit palette from an isometric perspective and are generally adequate to the task. Sadly, 640x480 is the one and only resolution available. Animation is limited to human (and some animal) characters but at least there is an abundance of it. Explosions toss bodies in different directions, civilians cower in a squatting position when caught in crossfire and enemies breathe shallowly while dying. Don't buy this one for the kiddies.  Individual mercenary characterizations have always been regarded as the major strength of Jagged Alliance, and Unfinished Business is no exception. Most of the actors and actresses deliver their voice-over lines with enthusiasm. The wry sense of humor is just as evident as ever: Spider, a doctor by trade, deadpans after executing an enemy, ~I'm such a hypocrite~. Funny. During down time when mercs may heal wounds and improve attributes, random comments are volunteered, some will gripe about the performance of their compatriots while others bemoan your crappy leadership.  Sound effects accompanying each weapon are clear, distinct and generally accurate to their type. Ricochets, changing magazines and ambient environment sounds are all handled very well.  Moving your troops around the battlefield is fairly intuitive. Left click a merc and color-coded footprints track the mouse cursor, displaying energy usage. It is even possible to set specific waypoints. Right click, after selecting a merc, to bring up an aiming reticule, the center of which displays the action point cost. Improving weapon hit chances may be improved by subsequent right clicks, upping the amount of action points expended. The only detractor to the interface is that moving around the backs and sides of buildings can be awkward, since the cursor will change state based on what it is over and sometimes snaps to certain objects when all you want to do is crawl next the foundation of a house.   The heart of the game, engaging the enemy, is both feast and famine. Firefights can be intense and exciting, when they are set up properly. However, enemy hearing, sight and reflexes seem to have been bionically enhanced, such that successful movement to contact is as much a factor of luck as it is a result of sound tactics. You units may employ stealth to move silently, but the action point cost is very high, especially when crawling or crouched. Stealth also takes a toll on fatigue levels, further impacting weapon accuracy. It's a vicious cycle. When spotted, expect to be fired upon. And hit. Often. Each of your mercs would be wise to travel with a medical kit, as wounds will mount up rapidly. The manual fails to impart anything of substance regarding the myriad weapon types and their possible alterations, nor of the impact of certain body postures and terrain on combat. Fortunately, Interplay's website provides links to a litany of fan sites that brimming with valuable strategies and weapon insights.  Problems aside, the reward for clearing a map and the booty that can be obtained makes it all worthwhile. Merc ratings increase when tested in combat  Pick several locks successfully and your mechanical rating improves, the same goes for medical, marksmanship and explosives. As your mercs experience grows so too does their effectiveness. Carefully guide your mercs through to the mid game, picking up armor and equipment along the way, and your squads will be something to be reckoned with.   In all, Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business has some structural drawbacks and overall the presentation does feels kind of dated. Higher resolutions graphics, toning down the inhuman enemy effectiveness and starting out the mercs with better armor and weapons would go a long way to making the next Jagged Alliance, if there is one, a much more satisfying and less frustrating experience. Still, the role-playing elements are so strong and the visceral impact of the combat absolutely cannot be beat by any other game in the marketplace. Interplay promises between 30 and 55 hours of gameplay, and I believe it. Add to that a deep and accessible campaign editor and this is a game with legs. Just don't be surprised to see them shot out from under you.  -- David Kozlowski      Want to share your opinions with the world?
