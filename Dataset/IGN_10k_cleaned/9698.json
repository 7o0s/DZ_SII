{"name": "Fatal Fury", "name_review": "Fatal Fury: First Contact", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/07/15/fatal-fury-first-contact", "text": "Fighting fans who are looking to get their fists on one of SNK's handheld brawlers have three major franchises to pick from: King of Fighters, Samurai Shodown and Fatal Fury: First Contact. We're here to tell you to stick with the first two. You would think that a game using a near identical fighting engine would be just as good  but Fatal Fury: First Contact just isn't as well-rounded a game..  Features  11+ characters. Three difficulty settings. Customizable battle settings. Play head-to-head via the link cable. Compatible with NeoGeo Pocket and NeoGeo Pocket Color.   The Game Fatal Fury is pretty good fighting game that may stand out among other fighting games for Game Boy or Game.com, but just doesn't manage to get close to SNK's other fighting efforts on the NeoGeo Pocket Color. Like King of Fighters and Samurai Shodown, it offers a large number of selectable characters, a two-player link-up mode and a power gauge system. The game controls well (it uses button tapping for weak attacks and quick moves and longer button entries for more powerful attacks or jumps) and performing combos and specials becomes second nature after a few minutes of play. Speed-wise, Fatal Fury feels a tad slower than the two other SNK fighters, mainly because of longer jump times.   Graphically, Fatal Fury looks similar to King of Fighters, with well-animated, three-color sprites and a slew of animations. The letter-boxed backgrounds aren't as well-drawn, but music and sound effects are on par.  Our biggest complaint with the game, besides the fact that most of the characters just aren't compelling enough (a problem with the whole FF series), is its lack of depth. Where King of Fighters and Samurai Shodown offered plenty of modes and features for players to explore, Fatal Fury comes up short. Sure, the power gauge system adds some depth by enabling three different special attacks, depending on the level of the gauge  but it just isn't enough. Even with its solid two-player mode and an amusing ~continue service~ (after you get your butt whooped, the game shows its mercy by letting you pick an optional bonus, such as maximum power gauge, 1/4 enemy energy, or a one-match give-away), will mostly appeal to beginning players who don't expect a high level of challenge and longtime play value from their game. Fatal Fury is another quality fighting game that manages to entertain for a while, but can't measure up to the depth and excellence exhibited by SNK's two other launch fighting games. The derivative character design certainly doesn't help.  If you're into fighters, definitely buy Samurai Shodown and King of Fighters first, before making first contact with Fatal Fury.", "date": "Jul 15, 1999"}
