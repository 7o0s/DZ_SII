The latest Cabela game doesn't work as an arcade-style hunting game either, leaving it without proper focus or fun. Alaskan Adventures needs significant work in just about every area. Even hunting and fishing enthusiasts should think long and hard before considering this as their off-season fix.   The main mode of play in Cabela's Alaskan Adventures is unsurprisingly named adventure. After customizing your character, you're thrown into a small tutorial before arriving at the first of four outposts. Each outpost serves as the central hub for launching your forays into the wilderness. At them, you can purchase tags for upcoming hunts, decoys and other gear, along with a wide range of guns and bows. The region around each outpost has paths leading to several hunting grounds as well as boards for entering tournaments such as dog sledding, duck hunting, or fishing.   Unfortunately you can't purchase anything at the outposts that will shorten the load times or improve the framerate. Just walking into an outpost, which is essentially just a menu screen, requires a nice thirty second load and you can expect similar long waits every time you want to enter a new area, regardless of how expansive it is. Once you do get things loaded, the visuals aren't exactly pretty. Outside of some fairly nice water, the graphics look largely bland. That is unless you like a sloppy frame rate that chugs when several animals get on screen and occasionally stutters just from looking around quickly. It's quite obvious that very little was done to improve the engine while bringing Alaskan Adventures to Xbox 360.   The annoyances continue when you try to actually hunt something. The stamina bar makes a return and continues to hamper the Cabela experience. All of the hunters in the game are incapable of even walking across a field without having to pause to catch their breath. Running puts the same exact drain on your stamina that slowly creeping through the underbrush does which makes any sort of stealth play infuriating. Just trying to walk across a field towards a good place to hunt has to be broken up with moments of standing in one place listening to some heavy breathing. These hunters must be the most out of shape people in the entire world.   The most vicious bears this side of Grizzly Man. What makes the stamina bar even worse is that setting up a camp and using decoys or lures to draw in animals doesn't really work and is far from the most effective way to hunt. Although in real life, wandering around and making a lot of noise will generally spook every animal within a hundred yards, that isn't the case in Cabela's Alaskan Adventures. Nearly every animal in the game will try to attack you as soon as they catch wind of you, straight down to the smallest predators and seemingly benign grazing beasts. Rather than trying to use cunning to shoot unsuspecting animals, making your presence known and shooting them between the eyes as they charge you is the easiest way to progress through the game. Each animal has one of two types of AI; run like crazy in circles or attack. Although you can't go more than 50 yards without pausing to gasp for air, the animals have no such problems. All of this is especially fun when you're too tired to move and an animal decides to attack. Occasionally you'll just see your health bar start going down as there isn't really any aural or visual indication that you're being beaten in the back of the head by a giant grizzly bear. Or, you might see the animal coming from the front and shoot it while it is still 10 yards away only to find that it somehow registered an attack on you without being anywhere near you.    There are three levels of difficulty that you can try playing Alaskan Adventures on. On the lowest setting, you'll get a hunter's sense that will let you know when animals are around with a flashing icon, bullet time to properly aim your shots, and radar that will lead you right to where the animals like to hang out. Turning the difficulty all of the way up removes these crutches and supposedly makes the decoys and calls less effective. No matter what setting the game is played on, looking on your GPS to see where animals hang out (they'll always be in the same general area for each specific hunt) and then wandering around that area until something either attacks you or begins to run in circles quickly is still the best way of hunting.    To progress from one outpost to the next, you have to go through a set of three main hunts and complete at least one of the fishing challenges. There are plenty of special hunts at each outpost with each of them similar to the main hunts in that they give you a set of animals to hunt under specific conditions (using a scoped rifle, for example) in a nearby region. Some of the conditions are just bizarre. Feel like running through the woods and fields chasing down beavers and then shooting them with a pistol? We didn't either, but its one of the fantasy special hunts in Alaskan Adventures. Another required us to use a shotgun to hunt down squirrels. Now, we may not be the most accurate shot in the west, but we're pretty sure a red squirrel can't absorb three shotgun hits to any part of its body and keep moving at the same rapid pace.   Race your way to boredom. The fishing, duck hunting, and dog sledding side adventures that you can take part in are just plain bad. Like the hunting, fishing isn't even close to realistic (allowing a spoon to float motionless next to a fish should never be a workable tactic).  Nor is it fun. Fishing, duck hunting, and racing games have all been done better numerous times in other games and it's a wonder that the Cabela series still hasn't approached doing these extra adventures properly.    Heavy breathing is the most common sound effect you'll hear in Alaskan Adventures. Outside of some background nature sounds such as birds chirping, there isn't much to hear. Animals rarely make any noise, but for some reason the outfitter from the outpost will scold, praise, or mock you at every turn. Thankfully, you can turn the voice off in the sound options as hearing the same small set of ~jokes~ for hours on end is quite irritating.   Cabela's Alaskan Adventures needed a complete overhaul for Xbox 360 and, instead, we've been given a sloppy port of the old generation engine and gameplay. The way hunting and fishing are presented falls outside the realms of pure simulation and arcade fun, making for a confounding mishmash of ideas that don't work together. The presentation, graphics and sound too are indicative of Alaskan Adventure's budget status. With all of the progress made in recent years towards creating good stealth and FPS engines, as well as in AI, its clear that with the proper design and effort, an excellent hunting and fishing game could be made. That was not the case here.", "date": "Oct 6, 2006"}
