{"name": "Endless Ocean", "name_review": "Endless Ocean AU Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/16/endless-ocean-au-review", "text": "I'd love to have been a fly on the wall in the boardroom when this concept was being pitched to Nintendo who, I'm sure, ate it up immediately. This is the gaming equivalent of going on safari, going fishing, going swimming. There's no overriding objective that carries you through the whole game, apart from collating data on the 214 different species of aquatic, seaside and mythical life. You swim around, barely interacting with the environment; a passive observer with a camera, an underwater pen, a porpoise companion and a desire to see what's just around the bend.   The developer, Arika (who are responsible for the Street Fighter EX series and, erm, the upcoming Jewlery Master), has developed a very pure adventure  in that the adventure is all about exploring a convincingly crafted underwater world. There is no action here; it's experiential, mellow and slow-paced. This will be an immediate turn-off for those who want to do some Jaws-style shark hunting or are hoping to jet-ski from point to point. This is definitely a Touch Generations! title through and through.     You start off by choosing a male or female form  either tanned or pale, hair tied back or shaggy and unkempt. After naming him or her, you're deposited onboard your own private vessel and the experience begins. Your actual role in the game is that of a tour guide and sometimes-researcher. A leggy female scientist acts as your mentor throughout the game and her moderately corny dialogue (all text; no voice acting here) sequences break up the times between surfacing after your last dive and preparing for the next.   Your swimming controls couldn't be easier or more intuitive. Either hold down B to start your character swimming, or press down the minus button to turn on auto-swim. The pace is a little lacking, but it makes sense in some of the cavernous environments later in the adventure. To look around or steer, just move the unobtrusive blue dot around the edges of the screen, and you'll reorient as appropriate. Easy.  No nunchuks needed  all of the controls are mapped to the remote, including map view and item menu. The camera system is mostly fixed behind your character; you can enter first-person at any time, and zoom in to focus on any patch of reef or stonework. Hidden creatures and treasure send up little sparkles, urging closer examination.    In a lot of ways, Endless Ocean shares its free-roaming mechanics with other sandbox adventure games. You're notified via in-game email of new missions, objectives and backstory segments, and it's up to you whether or not you decide to pursue them, and in which order you eventually do so. Time passes slowly from day to night, and the game tracks the seasons as they shift, affecting which species appear where and when. Given that the game plays out in pseudo-real-time, there is an imposed seven day limit on you responding to tasks like guided tours. Really though, for game that gives you as much freedom as it does, imposing a meaningless limit like this feels counterintuitive. These limits extend to the immovable circle of exploration you're allowed to paddle around in; you must hop back onboard your boat, enter the cabin and choose a new location before setting off and diving again. Given that you can re-enter your boat at any time while you're under water, surely this same grace should be granted to your ability to relocate your dive site.   Look out, Steve!  In your adventure, you're asked to escort AI divers on mini-expeditions to find certain native underwater life. These ad-hoc missions become a little repetitive after a while  just take them with you (making sure not to leave them behind with too much fancy manoeuvring) and inspect a few varieties of life, including their requested species, which is generally tricky to find. You're emailed a score based on how much you impressed the client, and occasionally you'll be sent new outfits and gear with which to play dress-ups.    Other sub-quests include photographing and cataloguing, as well as scouring the seabed and coral formations for sunken artefacts. These help flesh out the story, told through cutscenes and emails. They're entirely voluntary (as are all the tasks in the game), but for Animal Crossing fans, these won't faze you. Everything is tracked up onboard your ship for easy reference. You can also gather 'partners' in the form of dolphins and porpoises, who you can name, train and take with you on jaunts. Handily, they'll stop and point out places of interest, such as hidden animals and artefacts. The trick portion seems kind of pointless, but the option is there; it definitely breaks up the repetition of fish-seeking, and come on  dolphins are cool, right?   Interacting with the sea life, birds and critters is kind of silly  in order to collate the data, you need to 'get to know them'. This involves locking onto a target, hitting A to poke them repeatedly, holding A and shaking the remote to pat them, or feeding them by bringing up generic fish food with the D-pad, and releasing it in a cloud of muddy yellow. After charming them enough, they glitter for a moment and a fact file is opened up. Hmmm. We're not sure patting down stingrays and sharks is such a good idea, Nintendo  it didn't turn out too well for Steve Irwin, after all.    Regardless, a little way into the game, you can take your uncovered creatures to an aquarium for display. In the large tank, you can deposit any combination of these, based on their total overall size. To what end? It isn't really clear  it's just an added extra, we suppose; much like your option to sit on a sun chair on the deck of your boat and gaze out at the horizon, or the way you can just paddle around for the sake of doing so.   As the name implies, Endless Ocean is vast in scale. While it definitely has a finite amount of things to see and do (think The Neverending Story), the game's underwater world is huge and varied. It would take a couple dozen hours to see every key site with only a rudimentary amount of exploration. The natural beauty of coral reefs, deep, black abysses, shallow atolls and limestone cave systems are spread across the fictional tropical setting. The textural detail below the water sits amongst the best on the system. All manner of sea life have been carefully reproduced and animated with exacting detail  well, as much as the Wii can handle  and is really only let down by the 480p resolution. It's smooth, but you'll wish you could bump up the clarity.    Stunning. It's easy to forget that the Wii is capable of spectacular looking games.   Above the water, the graphics are a different story. The animations of the two human characters are wooden and stilted; your main character walks like he's had a flounder forcibly inserted into his behind, or has taken to being the cabin boy (or girl) for a fleet of well-hung sailors. The objects are self-shadowing, however, and the water effects and overall saturated tropical colour scheme are really pleasant. The invisible walls prevent you from approaching the mainland, but there's enough going on in the waterways to keep you preoccupied. Who needs verdant mainland when there's a rainbow of flora and fauna under the waves?   The talented soloist Hayley Westenra provides ten music tracks in the game; from the title sequence to incidental location themes. It's flowery, choral and well-suited, but if you're not into Enya-style chants and hymns (or you're under the age of 40), Nintendo has wisely allowed you to import your own MP3s off the Wii's SD card slot. This is the second game to allow you to do so  the other was the excellent Excite Truck. It's a nice touch  we think Zeppelin's The Rain Song works really well, but if Happy Hardcore's your thing, go nuts.  Amazingly, simplicity and repetition really doesn't bring the game down  it's a solid and pleasant experience, with the same staggered, protracted pace as a game like Animal Crossing or even Pokemon Snap back on  the Nintendo 64; in terms of depth, it sits somewhere between the two. It's a meditative experience that, like most of Nintendo's off-beat Touch Generations! titles, is niche from the get-go. If it sounds boring to you, then you'll probably find it to be so. If, on the other hand, pure exploration appeals, then Endless Ocean is a pearl.", "date": "Jan 16, 2008"}
