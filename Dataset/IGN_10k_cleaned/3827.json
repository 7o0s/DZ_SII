Well, wait no longer, as the classic top-down wartime shoot-'em-up is back in action, and ready to go for a ride your pocket.  Features: Top-down shooting Ten stages Two huge bosses High score board  Much like the Cold War-era shooters of the Ikari and Midnight Resistance ilk, Cartel Wars employs a ridiculous, over-the-top story before dropping you into a mess of serious boom-boom action.  Buff warrior princess Julia must infiltrate a guerilla-infested countryside and root out a corrupt Colonel's army, all before breakfast.  The action unfolds exactly like those Regan-era classics.  You guide Julia through each sub-level, blasting bad guys, tanks (anything that moves, really), and barrels with bigger-than-life guns.  Along the way, collect weapon power-ups, such as rockets, homing missiles, and whanot.  Ham and health tanks refill your health when you've taken too many to the chest.  One-ups also lurk behind corners and behind enemy lines.  Julia comes equipped with some then-state of the art bang-bang.  Pressing ~7~ lobs grenades into foxholes and over enemy barricades.  But if you really want to clear the screen, dial ~9~ for an airstrike that leaves nothing but pixellated carnage in its path.  Control is fairly simple.  If you prefer not to use the touch pad for moving, press ~1~ to go up, ~4~ and ~6~ to dart left or right, or ~8~ to retreat.  Pressing ~5~ fires straight ahead, while ~1~ and ~3~ shoot diagonally in those directions.  We'll give you one try with the touch pad before you make the switch, permanently, fella.  Visually, Cartel Wars doesn't look half-bad -- not quite SNES, but definitely better than NES.  The sprites are big and detailed, even if they do repeat themselves too often.  (But what do you expect from such a tiny DL?)  The levels are nice and straight-forward, with lots of detail and color, as well.  And like other celly games, the soundtrack is incredibly limited -- for such an intense war zone, it sounds like a really muted planetarium.  80s arcade bang-bang comes to your handset, with over-the-top expolsions and non-stop action fully intact.  Personally, I realized how much I missed this genre once Cartel Wars reminded me of it.  A good, solid actioner that's sure to entertain for an hour or so.", "date": "Aug 6, 2003"}
