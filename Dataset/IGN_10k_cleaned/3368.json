The film inspired a decent (albeit clunky) PlayStation 2 game, and those same developers have also charted out a Game Boy Advance title that's different and better than the average licensed game gets on the handheld system.  Features  Solve puzzles and thwart enemies as the intrepid Jim Hawkins Race your solar surfer across the dangerous surfaces of distant planets Call on Morph to use an ever-expanding set of special moves to get past obstacles Only for Game Boy Advance   Disney Interactive sent Jim Hawkins off on a standard 3D platformer for his PS2 voyage to the secret stash of Space Pirate Flint, so it'd stand that they'd simply design the same type of platformer for the GBA's smaller boat. Instead, however, Bizarre Creations went one better and did an isometric action-puzzler game that retains some of the better qualities of the PS2 game (Morph's special abilities, focus on deviously placed obstacles rather than constant enemy battles) and leaves the Mario hopping/butt-stomping to the next licensed game.  I'm not sure how a puzzler straight out of Equinox came from the action romp Treasure Planet (I'd guess the block puzzles of new 3D puzzler like Tomb Raider had something to do with it), but it's not a bad fit, and it's something the GBA hasn't seen its share of. The twists and turns in Treasure Planet never leave you scratching your head for days like the best of puzzlers can, but there's plenty of clever challenges across the game's 19 levels to give your brain a work-out. And even when your mind is already wrapped around the riddle, there's still forces working against you -- fireballs blowing up your boxes, robots resetting your switches, and baddies attacking you as you move about the stage. You'll still throw plenty of right hooks and roundhouse kicks, but most of the game has Jim pushing blocks, hopping across chasms, and calling on his gooey alien buddy Morph to give players special abilities that'll help make it to the goal. An auto-map feature helps steer younger players towards the next challenge, so getting lost is the least of your worries -- just keep thinking of how to get on that platform way the heck up there.  Besides being an enjoyable puzzler game, Treasure Planet shows presentation qualities that don't show up in most games crammed onto a GBA cart. The isometric graphics are very good, with plenty of detail to help make the limited geometry of this perspective seem less squared off. As always with this perspective, it's an odd angle for the controls and depth perception, but the game's slower puzzle layout and simple controls help take away confusion, and except for fights, there's not much to worry about in the isometric engine. Beyond just detail, Bizarre Creations has an impressive engine that use the GBA's abilities in ways that most devs shy from -- seeing the transparencies, rotating and scaling sprites, old-school ~particle~ effects, lightning/lighting and rain effects, added background sprites, and animated backgrounds reminded me of many SNES sleepers that just played with the system for fun (all this coming from a company that, as far as I can tell, haven't done a GBA title before.) Even the sound track takes things a step further than would be expected -- I'm not sure why the same song and variations of it repeat over and over again on every stage of a level (hey, at least it's a good tune every time), but the little squiggle noises that Morph constantly makes and the ascending cartoon chords you hear as you pick up coins are fun touches that don't get done in GBA sound design often ... ever, actually.  The GBA expedition isn't without its rough seas, however. The Solar Surfing stages -- which looks to be the focus of the game from the box art and package back description -- kind of sucks since the isometric perspective messes up your bearings when racing at high speeds. These stages are still fun to play in little bursts (and thankfully, there's only a few of these stages in between the puzzle adventure), but it's clearly sharp as the main game. You can tell from the wonky speed-up/slow-down controls and screwy way that the game sometimes scrolls you off-screen that this section of the game wasn't worked out right before it shipped. Then there's the adventure portion, which is basically the same kind of stage done over and over. Why does every stop on your trip have three or four things that need to be collected before you take off again, and why are even the galleys of your own ship filled with spiked pits and floating platforms? Because there wouldn't be a game otherwise, but who wants that as an answer. Exploring isn't worth it since there's no hidden treasures in the thoroughly-planned stages. Minor gripes are that the story doesn't exactly leap off the screen (I stopped paying attention to the flat dialog sequences after the first stage) and the password function instead of battery backup (but I did like that all the passwords are simple stage codes like ~cloudy~ and ~captain~ that were easy to keep straight.)   (Oh, and just a quick note to the producers at Disney Interactive -- both this game and Kim Possible had a problem that you guys should look out for next time of not letting players turn their characters around if the player is wailing on the attack button, and if you've ever seen a kid button-mash through a game, you'd see that this is pretty important for giving adrenaline-charged kids a fighting chance at fighting.)  I've learned over the years to set my expectations at rock-bottom levels for licensed titles on GBA (especially licensed titles released around the holidays) and just hope for a surprise. Lo and behold, Treasure Planet was one of those surprises. I'm not sure if Bizarre Creations' GBA team (or partners -- I recognize at least one name on the credits list from other places) will turn up again, but they got a lot of small things right in this small game. The Solar Surfing is only so-so, but if you're looking for an adventure that'll challenge your mind as well as your reflexes, this one should be marked on your map.", "date": "Jan 10, 2003"}
