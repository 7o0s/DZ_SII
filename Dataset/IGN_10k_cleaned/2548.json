With a birds-eye view, players took control of a cool car and sped along roadways, destroying bad guys.  It's been a long time since that game took in its first quarter, but Midway has revived the franchise, bringing it to all three consoles.  Gone is the 2D top-down view, replaced by a 3D engine to bring SpyHunter up to today's standards.  While it's a good and fun translation to the 3D world, I'd still rather play the original.    Features:14 action-packed missions  Awesome Peter Gunn theme song  Behind the scenes making of SpyHunter  New FMV content  Xbox exclusive - Original arcade SpyHunter included  Gameplay  Travel around in your G-6155 Interceptor through fourteen missions, exploring exotic locales like Panama, Key West, and Venice.  You'll shoot experimental helicopters, blow up trucks, and accidentally kill innocent civilians.  The Interceptor changes from swanky sports car to motorcycle (when you've taken too much damage) to a boat (floaties optional).  Each mission has a main objective, which must be completed to pass the mission, and several secondary objectives.  To open new missions you'll need to have completed a certain number of objectives.  Objectives range from the fun stuff (like blowing things up) to the slightly less fun stuff (like shooting tracking devices on boats).     The game is always moving, with little time to sit around and discuss politics or the weather.  SpyHunter translates well into the 3D world.  There are plenty of elements from the original, including the weapons truck you can park yourself in for new gadgets and a shiny new finish.  But there's a lot more than just weaving through traffic and shooting bad guys.  You'll have to shoot global tracking devices on different objects and collect satellite hook ups (these get much harder to get to towards the end) along the way.  Levels take place over ground and water, but fear not, your G-6155 Interceptor can bust a little Transformers action and switch between the two.     You've got plenty of cool gadgets to toy with.  You're like Sean Connery without the cool accent.  Midway plays up the spy element very nicely.  It comes off as a bit impersonal though, since your interactions are done with cars.  Even with the cut scenes, you never really know the enemy.  This could be a turn off for some.  But anyone looking for just a good arcade shooter won't mind a bit.   Bashing with armored cars can be a lot of fun.  And like all the great classic arcade games, it doesn't get old.  It's not as hard as the arcade version, though, but some of the side missions get challenging towards the end.  Speaking of the end, well, it comes too soon.  Fourteen missions just aren't enough.  Yes, it may take some time to get every last objective, but the fun is in racing around killing baddies.     The controls are simple enough, with the triggers cycling and firing your main weapons.  Opponents on your tail can be taken out with oil slicks and smoke screens, which are handled with the white and black buttons.  You'll primarily be dodging and firing.  While the controls and gameplay are solid, SpyHunter never really got my jaw dropping.  It's not a bad game, but it certainly isn't anything special.  The game is almost a direct port of the PS2 version.  There are a few DVD features, like a ~making of~ spot, but nothing too exciting.  The one thing that is cool is the inclusion of the original SpyHunter arcade game.  You'll only find this on the Xbox version.  One problem this poses for the new game is that, well, the old classic is better.  In fact, I had a bit more fun playing it than playing through the new game.     Graphics  The game suffers from some rather lackluster textures and an overall feel of just not being sharp.  It doesn't look any different than the PS2 version, which came out last year.  Running at 30fps, there is quite a lot of jitter.  This game has no excuse for not running smoothly.  But there are jaggies and slowdown aplenty here.  It's not so much that you can't play the game, though.  In fact, you might have enough fun to ignore the graphical problems, but they are there.  And they aren't well hidden.   Some of the explosions look absolutely poor.  I thought we did away with giant pixels?  I know SpyHunter is trying to tap into that classic feel, but that's a bit much.  The game doesn't look terrible, it just doesn't match up to other Xbox titles of late.  This really does look just like the PS2 version.  In fact, if we were reviewing the PS2 SpyHunter the graphics would get a nice golf clap of approval.  But everything just feels a little too simple and too toned down for our big green box.   Sound  If you love Peter Gunn's classic theme song, you'll be in heaven playing SpyHunter.  Featuring numerous variations of the song, SpyHunter will Peter Gunn you to death.  There's really not much of any other music in the game.  It works fine, but is just another example of how the game fails to excel in any one place.  It gets the job done, just doesn't go any farther.  The sound effects are your standard engine revs, tire squeals, and gun shots.  It's an arcade game and it feels like it.  If more care had been taken to make a wider range of sounds and a deeper score, SpyHunter could have really immersed gamers.  As it stands, it's really just a game you plop a quarter in, play for a bit, and walk away from.  Spy Hunter isn't quite the playboy spy-action thriller it wants to be.  This is more Larry Flynt than Hugh Hefner.  It gets the job done, but it could be so much classier.  A direct port of a game that came out several months ago on an older platform just won't cut the mustard anymore.  The visuals are almost identical to the PS2.  With what we've seen of Xbox titles recently, this is just shabby.  Jaggies, slow down, and a framerate that hovers around 30 frames per second (and dips a whole lot lower)?  It's time we expected a bit more from Xbox games.  Spy Hunter isn't a bad game by any means, but it settles for being passable instead of challenging to be something stunning. If you have the PS2 version, don't bother picking this one up. If you are interested, you may want to rent it first. You can probably pass it over a weekend and you may find there's little to come back for.", "date": "Mar 12, 2002"}
