It's around this premise that Shadowrun is based, and at first glance it has successfully married these two very different methods of dealing pain. Yet, around the 100th time that an Elf kills you with his Katana, simply because you thought you'd try a different class, you'll realise that there's no real magic here, just a cheap slight of hand trick.   If you're looking for a meaty singleplayer game, point your thumb-sticks elsewhere, as Shadowrun is focused purely on multiplayer. Sure, it's got a long and tedious set of tutorials to keep you busy for an hour, as well as bot-support for offline matches, but neither mode is worth dusting your chaingun-armed Troll off for. Bot AI is simple at best, mind-numbingly dumb at worst. It's not surprising really - with the range of weaponry and magic in the game, it'd take the likes of HAL 9000 to get the most out of the plethora of spells and guns.     So, online it is then, and it's here that we've got our biggest gripe with the game. Put simply, finding a match is about as much fun as dry humping a massive cactus in the nude. It's a fully automated system, as seen in Halo 2. There's no server browser as such - you simply click play and then the game tries to find you a game based on your preferences (which map you'd like to play and with how many players), your Trueskill rating and your connection quality.   Unfortunately, we've found the average time to join a match is over ten minutes sometimes much, much longer. We're talking hours. There's a lengthy thread on the official forums about this, and one of the developer's recommendations is that players try not to play too well, as they could end up with a Trueskill rating that is too high. Seriously, if that's the best solution the team can offer, they need to entirely rethink the game's server browser.    And once you're in a game, don't be surprised if you randomly drop out halfway through - we once lost a game nine minutes in after waiting three hours to join it in the first place! That's not a healthy ratio. These connection issues seem to be more of an issue for Aussies than Americans, and is probably due to our much smaller Xbox Live player base. Don't expect Microsoft to do anything about the problem either; in a recent interview with the Shadowrun producer, an Aussie MS rep said that many of the local Xbox Live problems would solve themselves if more people in Australia bought 360s. So if you want Shadowrun to work, go out and purchase five more 360s!    When, and if, you do find a match, things start to look a little rosier. Think Counter-Strike, but with four different player classes, each with different strengths based around essence (this is the pool of energy used to activate magical and technology skills). Humans have the least essence penalty when using technology, Trolls are lumbering beasts who can take a beating, Elves are the nimblest and can regenerate health, while Dwarves have a high essence pool and can leach essence off other players and objects.     You'll use this essence for a range of powers, with some of the coolest being:   -Smoke: turns the player into a cloud of smoke which can't be shot, but can be damaged by the Gust magical attack.    -Strangle: creates a large field of crystals which are hard to pass. Great for closing off chokepoints.    -Teleport: Warps the player several metres in the direction they're travelling. Awesome graphical effect, but not that useful.   -Resurrect: Brings other players back to life.    Within a few rounds you'll have more magical powers than you know what to do with, as only three can be equipped at any one time. Choosing these isn't so much about creating a well-rounded player; it's more about seeing what your opposition is using, and then trying to counter their skills. Besides, there seems to be only one class that most players are using anyway    Elves, decked out with Smoke, Wings and Wired Reflexes (making them even more agile than they already are) and the Katana weapon populate 80% of the player slots that we've encountered. Using their high speed and ability to heal, they seem to totally dominate the game, especially in the CTF mode, where their speed makes them hard to catch. Perhaps they're so popular because they're the most ninja-like class, and who doesn't want to be an Elven ninja, but we're pretty sure that they're simply overpowered.    So instead of being a game of rock-paper-scissors, as we'd originally envisaged, it's a game of scissors-scissors-scissors, with the rocks and papers getting pummelled. Time will tell if the other classes need some boosting, but in the meantime the game would have been better titled ShadowElf.      We mentioned that Elves do so well in CTF, and because it's one of only two modes, they're getting a bit of a workout. The other mode is team deathmatch - for an online shooter, this lack of options is mind-boggling. Where are the objective modes, the capture the hills, the last man standings? In this day and age, where most shooters offer dozens of different modes, having a mere two is simply lazy.   This laziness extends to the number of maps. There are nine in total, each of which is extremely bland, and relatively small. Compared to the likes of GRAW2's maps, each of which has been lovingly hand-crafted with dozens of points of interest, the locations within Shadowrun just don't measure up.    It's not the worst looking game we've seen on the 360, but it's a long way from the top of the pile. Like the levels, the character models and animations are bereft of appeal, although some of the magical effects are eye-catching. Is it any surprise that the sound effects are also lacklustre?   So the matchmaking is broken, the characters seem unbalanced, the levels are lame and the visuals don't show what the 360 is really capable of. The only thing left to complain about are the controls. Loose and imprecise, they result in unspectacular fire-fights that are determined more by how many people are shooting at you than by a player's skill. It's the final plastic jewel in this tin foil crown.   We're not even going to touch the PC version - from all accounts, it's even more broken than the 360 version. And apparently it also causes lag when playing with 360 players - will this game's problems never end?It's a shame to see the acclaimed lads at FASA pump out such a generic, hobbled and shallow game. If it wasn't for the technical issues we've experienced, perhaps Shadowrun might be worth its bargain basement price, especially for those who crave a new online fix. But considering we spent more time waiting for a match than actually playing in any, there's no way we could recommend Shadowrun.", "date": "Jun 18, 2007"}
