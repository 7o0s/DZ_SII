Here's a company that whose very name commands your attention and respect. Why is this? Sure, when you think about it, 'Rockstar' is hardly a subtle branding for a company that deals in entertainment. It builds an image, and your perception of their game can be instantaneously influenced by their name alone.  If it's Rockstar, it's gotta be - at least - good, right? Well, that's the theory anyway. And Rockstar keep cranking out the good games, and so their image as software rock-stars is further reinforced.    And what is the latest piece of gaming quality to be dropped on unsuspecting PSP owners? Sure, it definitely isn't original, it isn't perfect, but you can't deny that a pocket version of The Warriors brings a lot to the table.   First off the cuff, The Warriors was always designed to be a two-player game. The gangland action that makes up the core of the game is perfect for two gamers of like minds to get crazy on the streets of New York City. Being on a portable system, the experience is immediately designed to be more social, pick-up-and-play, and instantly enjoyable too. Hence, Rockstar have wisely decided to make the PS2 version's unlockable 'Armies of the Night' bonus game accessible from the outset. For those unfamiliar with this bonus game, it is a side-scrolling 3D remake of Double Dragon, exact down to the glitches and rough edges - adding to the authenticity of the experience.   Of course, this is merely an aperitif compared with The Warriors' main course. The PSP version contains everything 2004's PS2 version contained. This includes all of the music, voice-acting, cutscenes and bonuses featured in original console release.   Laying the beat down is a pleasure for gamers. Not so much for the dude on the receiving end of this fist, though.  For the uninitiated, The Warriors is a cult film from the late 70s that took place in the streets of an alternate universe New York, where rival gangs with flamboyant outfits struggle for supremacy. It's the perfect setting for a fisticuffs action game, and that is, in part, what Rockstar has created. The other parts of the creation are the very clever ways in which Rockstar do a lot with the storyline; taking liberties and fleshing out the characters, while retaining the feel of the source material. By this, we mean the first three-quarters of the game is actually a prequel of sorts, leading up to the events of the main film. Rockstar even go one step further with unlockable bonus missions that provide character-specific background detail, such as how Cleon, Vermin and Cyrus rose through the ranks and where old tensions originated.   The controls from the PS2 version have been scaled back to take advantage of the PSP's button arrangement. The face buttons still grapple, throw, punch and kick, while the D-pad's directional buttons block and heal. L and R adjust the camera angle and target lock-on respectively. The game takes you through the basics of fighting, grappling, boosting car stereos, breaking and entering and general tomfoolery, so we'll spare you. However, there are definitely more moves in the game than outlined in the training, so we found that experimentation is rewarding. The engine is deep, and the variety of moves, grapples, tosses, reversals and power-charged super-smacks is as fun today as it was on the PS2.   The move across from PS2 to PSP has taken a toll on the graphics, but this is one of the most impressive ports we've seen. Facial textures are lower and the character models simplified, sure; however, the streets and cityscape looks amazing. In particular, the texture work is varied and sharp to the point where we were sure the PSP wasn't capable of this kind of detail. It isn't uniformly beautiful, but the team did a bang-up job at bringing The Warriors across in style. What was a little rough on PS2 suits the PSP very nicely.    The framerate still takes a beating, however; there are times when an entire gang of twelve will be after your posse of 6, and the result is choppier than a 70s kung fu flick. It is never a deal-breaker, but the PSP has its limitations and this is pretty much it.   The main game is meaty, weighing in at 20 hours or so, but the variety and number of unlockables definitely extends the play time by a fair amount. A major element emphasized for the PSP version is the inclusion of a proper 2-player co-operative mode. With a dedicated screen for each player, the result is much more satisfying and engrossing than split screen. Impressively, every area in the game, activity to be performed and chase to be given can be played through with two players. In addition to the Armies of the Night mode, it makes for compelling two-player fun.   We were impressed with the gameplay variety on offer. Street fighting is grand, sure, but breaking up the chaos with a timely race, some tagging, stealing, and a spot of the ole' ultraviolence demonstrates the depth of the licence nicely. The multiplayer modes focus on pit-match fighting, team-based tagging and more. They're certainly fun distractions, but there are better games that provide more depth in this area.   Graffing is a little trickier on the PSP, but the textures look sharp for a pocket title.  However, we're still frustrated by the imprecision of the control nub. It's a sticking point we'd love to overlook, but more often than it should be, we found ourselves having tremendous difficulty running in a straight line - something required for the rooftop jumping and platforming elements of the gameplay. Combined with an occasionally fiddly camera system that requires you to relinquish control of the nub before hitting L and resuming your movement of the nub, it can make precise movements a real hassle. It also makes things like spray painting a little harder - which can cost valuable seconds and leads to a lot of wasted paint.   While little irritations in the porting process can take some of the shine off the release, there is no question that the solid beat-em-up action still plays exceptionally well. The production values are impressively high throughout, and while it is debatable whether or not this game really demanded porting, it is here and there's no reason not to enjoy it on the go.   Minor grievances aside, all of this adds up to an impressive addition to your PSP library. The PSP is experiencing a late summer of very good software - though, some might argue it's simply too late and damned regardless in the face of Nintendo's DS. Nonetheless, years from today gaming historians will smile down on Rockstar's contribution to the handheld, and The Warriors is another mostly-solid, violent, cuss-filled and compelling effort on their part.", "date": "Feb 22, 2007"}
