Big League Baseball 2005 is THQ Wireless' take on the great American game, but unfortunately this is not the firm's best effort. Big League Baseball 2005 makes a few missteps that sink the game, despite having some very impressive features that will please diehard fans.   While Big League Baseball 2005 does not have the full MLB license, THQ Wireless did strike a deal with the Player's Association and was able to supply fans with the accurate names and stats of their fave players. This does much to make up for the loss of actual team names and uniforms, since it's the fellas that actually put on the uniforms that count. The stat tracking feature is implemented quite well, giving this arcade-style baseball game some solid sim trimmings.   However, the actual baseball part of the game is hobbled by a bad design choice. Most baseball games switch between a view behind the batter and an overhead camera view of the fielding work. Big League Baseball 2005 positions the camera in a three-quarter view above the field and superglues it in place, leaving it only to scroll up the screen when the ball is sent into the field. While this keeps the fielders from looking like ants, it does a disservice to the batting and pitching contest.   Setting the camera behind the batter allows you to get a feel for which pitches you want to swing at. The isometric view steals away altitude, so it's difficult to see if a pitch is really low or wildly high. You can see whether it is inside or outside the strike zone to the left or right, but that's only half of the equation. You do, though, have different swings to choose from -- such as power hits and bunts -- which is nice to see.   Pitching is not as badly affected, as you still can choose pitches via the thumbpad. You can also opt just to have the pitcher throw his best pitch, whatever that may be, and then choose where it goes across the plate. Fielding is also under your control in Big League Baseball 2005, which is interesting (and pleasing) to see. You control the fielders, choose where to throw the ball, and run down players.   By making the batter and pitcher the same size as the rest of the players, the great contest is de-emphasized. Big League Baseball 2005 loses out on the chance to really up the production values here -- more animations, great player detail, etc. Instead, the action is actual somewhat boring to watch.   Big League Baseball 2005 has pretty good audio, including a powerful opening jingle and some good voice samples from the ump. The sound effects of hitting the ball are not as impressive, though.Big League Baseball 2005 is hard to recommend in the face of its competition. The inclusion of real-world players is great, the ability to control defense is smart, and the ability to choose what type of swing you want is also good to see. However, that camera angle was just a bad choice. It makes batting such a crapshoot sometimes that you want to squeeze your handset until you hear a satisfying/sickening ~crack.~ Hopefully, THQ Wireless will consider some design chances next time, because the game has some heart and offers a few good features -- no need to forfeit the game just yet. But baseball fans should sit Big League Baseball 2005 out this year.", "date": "Apr 16, 2005"}
