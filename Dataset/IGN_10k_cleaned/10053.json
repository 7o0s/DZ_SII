What got our excitement glands pumping was the prospect of playing Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer on the move, taking our Master League team out into the wild and saying goodbye to awkward waits on station platforms as we immersed ourselves in the definitive football simulation of our time.    So when Pro Evolution eventually made its way to the handheld with PES 5, the disappointment was a little hard to bear. Colossal loading times meant that if you wanted to indulge in a portable kick-around it was probably worth commencing your game the night before setting off, and once the action commenced it was ridden with frame-rate problems, giving the game all the fluidity of a cider-soaked pub team face-off. As if that wasn't enough, PES 5 drove its studs further into our weeping faces by omitting the Master League entirely.    Centre circle make a fake.  PES 6 thankfully went a good way to atone for the sins of its predecessor, reinstating the Master League, reducing the loading times to a more tolerable level and offering a largely faithful appropriation of its PlayStation 2 relative. PES 2008 on the PSP continues the progression, again taking the PS2 version as its foundation and this time adding to the formula in its own way  and in the process the game becomes easily the best sports title on Sony's handheld.    It's worth noting that the PES brand isn't necessarily bulletproof  as our review of the recent DS iteration will attest. However, when it clicks it really is without compare, and after only a handful of months away from Konami's series the robustness of the gameplay mechanics still prove a pleasant surprise upon our return. The PSP version is as good an entry in the series as any, with games opening up and playing out as... well, as a football game should. There's eulogies abound to the beauty of Seabass and his team's game engine, so to avoid repeating what's been said thousands of times before we'll just note that the PES formula is here intact  the most faithful interpretation of the beautiful game to date and now replete with the AI additions that marked this year's entry out over its forebears.    Poor chap's about to get football pie all over his shirt.  Any outstanding frame-rate issues have been further ironed out, though it is prone to a dip when the action is at its most frantic. Other than that it's as faithful a port of the PS2 version as you could hope for. Obviously, this was the year when the PES series finally settled in (or not, as you would be excused for believing) on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, but that doesn't detract from the joy of seeing the game running smoothly on the diminutive 16:9 screen, and it runs the PS2 version close visually  and in light of the issues that plighted the HD versions it is the PS2 version that we still return to.     The most inspired addition for us, then, is the reworked data sharing between the PS2 and PSP versions of PES 2008. Not only does this year's PSP model now boast a fully equipped edit mode, but Master League data can now be fully transferred between the two consoles, allowing us at last to take our beloved Deptford Wednesday with us wherever we roam. It's a truly inspired touch that finally fulfills the potential of the connectivity of the two consoles. It's just a shame that it comes just as the PS2 draws its final breaths.    A final addition to the game is the World Tour mode, whereby a team is taken around the globe and is tasked with fulfilling certain goals. In light of the all-encompassing Master League mode it may seem a little superfluous, but nevertheless it's a mode that acknowledges the shorter play periods expected on a handheld.      It's still not the perfect article: the PSP doesn't have the benefit of either a second analogue nub nor a full complement of shoulder buttons, meaning playing options aren't as plentiful as in the full-fat versions. And of course, reaching for our cynical hat we have to point out that it is just another PES  it's no significant leap from past iterations and there's the now familiar lack of comprehensive official licenses. But on the flip-side, it is a fully-fledged PES on the PSP, and that should be enough to get most people reaching for their wallets.  A bona-fide PES game on the PSP, PES 2008 admittedly only takes small steps from last years title, but it takes all the right ones. If there is anyone yet to be converted to Seabasss formula, this isnt the game to do it. However, for PSP owners who already worship at the temple of PES, this could well be their mana. In improving upon PES 6 it marks itself as the definitive sports title currently available on the PSP, and for those of a certain inclination it's therefore one of the best games there is for Sonys handheld.", "date": "Feb 20, 2008"}
