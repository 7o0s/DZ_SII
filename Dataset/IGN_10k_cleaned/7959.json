The first was to fake the dimension, placing a car or motorcycle sprite down at the bottom of the screen, then scrolling a simple background forward so the player appears to drive ~into~ the distance. The second was to take to the skies, flattening the action and presenting players with a birds-eye perspective. Both kinds of racers came to the TurboGrafx  Victory Run was the faker. Moto Roader was the bird.   Like a grand giant being you gaze down from above at Moto Roader's tiny tracks. Though the feeling that these cars are miniaturized isn't intended, the game stills plays that way  evoking memories of games like Micro Machines, R.C. Pro-Am or Ivan Stewart's Super Off Road. This title has a lot in common with those games, especially in how its cars handle.   Moto Roader features rotational control, meaning up isn't always up and down will rarely take you south. The way your vehicle moves depends on its orientation on the screen  if your car's pointed north, then everything feels normal. Pressing left makes a left turn, and right a right. But the controls don't adjust themselves after making a turn, putting the pressure on you to make the mental adjustment needed to compensate. One second, everything's normal. The next, controls seem to be reversed.   Rotational control has thankfully been phased out of racers over the years, though gamers experiencing it for the first time here will get a bit of break in adapting to it  if you fall too far behind in Moto Roader, the game will automatically zap your car forward again, into the middle of the pack. Part gameplay mechanic and part technical work-around, the track teleportation was probably included just to keep all five cars on the screen at all times. But that doesn't make this much of a race, does it?   You can't maintain much of a lead when your competition is continuously placed back into contention every time you try to pull away. Your only real strategy is to force them to teleport again and again  they take damage each time they do it, which will ultimately render them inoperable  or to go on the offensive with your on-board arsenal. Moto Roader comes equipped with a one-stop shop, where winnings won in races can be used to pimp your ride with better tires, engines, brakes and, most importantly, weapons. No banana peels or blue shells here  Moto Roader's array of ordnance is mostly explosive in nature.   Success in single player comes from knowing how best to invest your cash. Should you upgrade now to the slightly beefier engine, or save your dough for later and buy the most beefiest? You'll probably find yourself outpaced by the competition to begin with, but that'll change if you wait it out, upgrading your car appropriately and biding your time for future races. The only time patience doesn't pay off is in multiplayer, where up to five humans can race at once, and things will certainly devolve from an organized contest of speed into more of a motorized melee of bomb blasts. As with other five-player capable games on the Virtual Console, you'll need at least one Nintendo GameCube controller plugged in to play at full capacity.  Moto Roader is probably the least notable game to hit the Virtual Console so far. It's a mental throwback to an earlier era of racing games, a simpler time that is probably better left in the past for the frustrations of its control scheme. This game just doesn't have the nostalgia factor needed to forgive its failings in handling, and though playing with up to four friends is fun, they'll probably be wanting you to turn this one off and fire up Bomberman instead after just a few laps.
