And this mentality is certainly the case for Neo Turf Masters, a great golf title that features easy to pick up gameplay and a decent set of features. Stroke Play, Handicap, Triple Crown optionsSix different golfersThree international coursesBattery back-upFor NeoGeo Pocket ColorNeo Turf Masters was definitely designed as a down-and-dirty game of golf  something that has the strategy of the sport, but can be played without any tutorial. The game features three different courses with varying difficulty depending on the location: Fuji, Japan; Arizona, USA; and Baden, Germany. Do your math, and that's 54 holes in the game. Not too shabby. Like most golf titles, Neo Turf Masters depends on the ~accurate click~ for its gameplay. What you do is simple  in the overhead map, you aim where you want to hit the ball. Press A, and you can adjust whether you want to hook or slice the ball by pushing left or right at the tee. Start your swing by hitting the A button  the power gauge will zip upwards. Time the button push as close to the 100 mark as you can  you can also overswing for added club ~oomph~. As soon as you hit the button for the power, a second shot meter will begin to rise and fall  this will determine if it's a low or high shot trajectory. Hit it smack in the middle for a solid shot  but if you hit it in the red, you'll duff the swing and lose out on any kind of accuracy. On the putting side of things, you simply look at the slope of the terrain, and time the power gauge as close to the prime spot as possible.As soon as you hit the ball, you'll switch back to the overhead screen and watch where the ball goes. A tiny window will pop up when the ball lands, showing you what kind of terrain the little dimpled sphere landed in  from deep rough, to clean fairway turf, to the sand of a bunker.Each of the game's six characters has his own style and ability (sorry folks, no chick golfers here).  Want a power driver? Be prepared to have a weak putting game. They're all balanced in one specific ability  except two players who have equal everything, but don't excel in any particular ability.The biggest complaint about the game is how the putting is portrayed. Even though the slope of the green is indicated by harsh mesas, it's very difficult to tell which direction those hill are facing. The putting game is, admittedly, very simplistic, but watch out if you land on the opposite side of the green and have to try for a 50 footer. The slopes aren't easy to read.Probably one of the coolest features is in the two-player link-cable mode. If you defeat your opponent, you earn super clubs that can be used only once in a game. And Pokmon strikes again  you can trade these super clubs with your friends  if he has a god-like driver, you can trade it for your perfect putter.As far as golf titles go, Neo Turf Golf is a great one. There are a few interface problems, including trying to determine how far you are from your prime target  the overhead view is just a tad too close to the action. In all honesty, I've been having a lot more fun playing the Japanese version of Mario Golf on the Game Boy Color (to be released this October), but golf fans who own the NeoGeo Pocket Color are going to have a grand ol' time on this portable set of greens.", "date": "Sep 16, 1999"}
