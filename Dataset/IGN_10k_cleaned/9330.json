Tonight, Colorado's boys seek to take revenge at Fenway Park, reverse the landslide and tie up the Series before Boston can extend the lead to two. It's a yearly ritual  the Major League World Series  and chances are you're aware of it, even if you're not a big baseball fan throughout the rest of the year.    The same goes for this game. Sports titles, either serious simulation or arcade-esque, represent a genre that several players often ignore  but they always know it's there. Inoffensively iterating its wares, year after year, as video game technology improves but the real world versions of each pro contest always stay the same. World Class Baseball is a middle-of-the-road edition of its sport. Not one of the earliest, most limited video representations of the game, but also no longer new enough to be considered fresh, or to warrant much notice. Like the fifth of nine innings, World Class Baseball's appeal is lost somewhere in the middle of history  hardly memorable, not making too much of an impression.   You're offered a selection of 12 different teams, each one generic, unlicensedly representing the nations of the planet with names like the Bangkok Buddhas and the Tokyo Ninjas. An Edit Mode allows you to trade players, rotate positions and feel like a team manager, but the appeal of a feature like that is almost always tied in with a connection to the real world  if I get to take Ken Griffey Jr. and move him to the Atlanta Braves by my whim, that's interesting. It's less so when Generic Player #3 is being shifted to Generic Team #7.     In-game, the action plays out as you'd expect, with controls and normal operations presented in a way immediately familiar to anyone who's played a baseball title before. You step to the plate on offense, adjust your position relative to the strike zone with the D-Pad and try your best to knock one out of the park, choking up or down on the bat as wanted to compensate for whatever pitch you think is coming next. From the mound, your pitches can curve and slide as you'd like, with a fair amount of horizontal range allowed  you can easily bean the batter or force a walk if you want.   And on the field, you'll toss caught balls to any of the four bases with the standard, corresponding D-Pad directions  Up for second base, Down for home. All very expected, standard, and pretty uninteresting. There's a little bit of a difference in how World Class Baseball handles control over your men in the field when a ball is flying through the air, in that your direct control constantly switches to the man who's closest to the ball. This is a change from some other games of the same era, in which fielders might automatically move  but it also takes some mental adjustment, because fast-moving hits that pass by multiple players on their way to the outfield will cause your defensive control to swap as many as four times before finally settling on the guy that you'll actually be able to direct to pick up the ball.     If you're in the mood  perhaps after the Series ends and either Boston or the Rockies have taken this year's title  to just kick back and watch a game without any active input from you or anyone else, World Class Baseball also offers a Watch Mode. This is a Computer vs. Computer match that just plays itself, while you observe and do nothing. Maybe unpractical, but someone savvy will figure out a way to freak out their slow-witted friends with it.  The other option for baseball lovers on the Virtual Console is NES Baseball, and while World Class is a step above in its graphics and sound, it's still on the same level of fun  which is to say, about average. There's only so much appeal that an old-school sports sim with generic teams and players can offer, and while it might be too much to hope that we'll one day get an old game with an old player roster left intact, there are still other, more creative baseball titles that could be brought out of the late '80s and early '90s. Baseball fans, keep your 600 Wii Points stowed in the dugout, or else put those same six dollars toward an original Wii experience like The Bigs or MLB Power Pros. They're a better way to play ball today.", "date": "Oct 25, 2007"}
