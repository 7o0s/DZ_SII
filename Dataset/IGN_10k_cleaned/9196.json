{"name": "Looney Tunes: Duck Amuck", "name_review": "Duck Amuck Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/09/duck-amuck-review", "text": "One of the greatest cartoons in Warner Bros. library of Looney Tunes animated shorts from its Golden Age of Animation is, hands down, the 1953 Chuck Jones-directed ~Duck Amuck,~ a cartoon where an off-screen animator (with his drawing tools) ends up tormenting Daffy Duck for a good six minutes. It was simple but hilarious, and even fifty years later its humor stands the test of time. And if you were a development studio put to the task of converting one of Warner Bros. hundreds of animated shorts to the DS, ~Duck Amuck~ would be the perfect choice.   And that's what WayForward was put to the task to do: to bring the dynamic humor of that six minute short to the Nintendo DS. The concept is actually quite brilliant: it's an unconventional out-of-the-box design where players are simply encouraged to pick on Daffy until he gets so pissed off he blows his stack. The underlying problem is that, while the presentation is through-the-roof awesome, the actual games that string everything together absolutely suck. It's a strange balance of love/hate for a reviewer; as a virtual interactive cartoon, the designers did a fantastic job. As a game, wellit really needs work.   Much of Duck Amuck's focus was in converting that same humor from the one cartoon into an almost ~sandbox~ environment where players feel like they're actually doing harm to poor Daffy. You, the gamer, are now in the role of the tormenting animator, using the stylus to show Daffy what for -- erase his beak and redraw it, turn down the volume on his monologue, even dangle the poor guy by the scruff and fling him around the menu system.   The animation is absolutely top notch, and really shows the passion the graphic artists and animators had towards the classic cartoon. Daffy moves with classic squash-and-stretch animation that mimics Chuck Jones' style and direction extremely well - clearly the team's using Flash-based medium for its artwork instead of the traditional ink-and-paint celluloid work from decades ago, but the contemporary technology captures the old-school skills pretty spot-on.      So, through the use of extensive video sequences that meld with interactive sprites, players poke and prod at Daffy (or at the environment around him) to trigger mini-game events. To reveal them in this review would ruin half the game's focus and charm: its cool sense of discovery. Which means I won't ruin all the surprises and reveal the different ways to torment the poor guy. Instead, I'll just jump right into the mini-games themselves.   They're bad. Oh so bad. When you get a collection of mini-games, generally there's a gem among the crap, but the mini-games in this pack are pretty much all duds. Slice Daffy in half again and again, until they're so small they simply disappear. Bounce food up to Daffy and make him overeat. Rotate a ~Stun Runner~ world around and make Daffy trip up. Dish out cards to the right poker players. There are about 20 mini-games in here, the idea behind most is to defeat Daffy or make him lose at the gamesomething that isn't made clear at the start. When you're playing a game where you think you're winning, you're actually losing and also losing a bit of ground trying to get to the end of the game. And I can't think of a single mini-game in here that I'd play on its own outside of the normal game progressionthey're that bad.   But there's no denying the game's humor: it's actually extremely well written and funny. Daffy constantly cracks jokes about the shoddy programming, the flavor-of-the-month videogame terms, the Nintendo DS system's abilities (including its pixel count). A lot of classic Duck Amuck jokes were rewritten and revisited for the Nintendo DS, including the one where a second Daffy shows up on the top screen to have a conversation with himself on the lower screen.  It also pokes fun at videogames themselves: in one challenge, Daffy's excited to be whisked away into an elaborate adventure quest, only to be thrust in the world of Atari 2600 circa 1979 in a spoof of Adventure - with Daffy in the role of the dragon (who, originally did look like duckskudos to the writer). The talent responsible for Daffy's voice injects the classic energy of a classic cartoon. The team loved the classic cartoon, and its shows.   And I have to say it, even if it means risking the surprise: Duck Amuck contains the most creative use of the Nintendo DS sleep mode I've ever experienced on the handheld. That's as far as I'll go. Find out for yourself.Ultimately, Duck Amuck succeeds more as an interactive cartoon than it does as a mini-game collection. It can almost be characterized as a Daffy Duck virtual pet a la Nintendogs. Almost, but not really. The strange balance of awesome cartoon/bad game design might not be enough to persuade the 30 dollar purchase, but you know what? Duck Amuck revives a lot of what made those Golden Age cartoons so great, so if you love those 'toons, this one's a cute, cool diversion even with the mini-game stinkers.", "date": "Oct 9, 2007"}
