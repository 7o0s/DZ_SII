In their efforts to differentiate Street Hoops from arcade basketball games like NBA Street or Midway's Showtime: NBA on NBC, Black Ops drew on every element of hardcore playground basketball they could -- from the music, to the clothes, to the jewelry -- to give their game an unrivaled sense of street credibility. The only problem is somewhere along the way, the basketball itself got lost in the mix. Going to barber shops, pawn shops and FootAction stores can be a hell of a lot of fun, but in a videogame called Street Hoops, we want good basketball, not a great shopping simulator. The FactsPlay as Street Ball legends such as Hot Sauce, Headache, and moreApparel from real brands including And 1, Enynce, and Sean JohnReal courts from around the world including the famous Rucker Park, Mosswood and othersVirtual cash system lets you bet on games and use your winnings to suit up with new gearLicensed hip-hop music from DMX, Redman, and othersSupports Dolby Pro Logic IIOne to four playersStreet CredStreet Hoops features playground legends like Booger Smith, The Future and Main Event, players who have more showmanship and trickery than most pro athletes you'll see in the NBA. That?s why they're better known by their nicknames than their street names. These are some of the ~other guys~ along with Jason Williams and Vince Carter featured in those wildly popular Nike freestyle basketball ads last year. They all have NBA talent but circumstances, politics, tragedy and/or physique re-routed their hoop dreams to the semi-pro periphery of the game. Putting players like this in an arcade game should mean gamers who don't live near a legendary playground like Oakland's Mosswood Park, where every seven or eight deadly sins are going on right across the street, or LA's Venice Beach Courts, where image is absolutely everything, can see and utilize stunning dribble moves, passes, fakes and shots they haven't even dreamed of. Street Hoops doesn't quite make that connection (more on that later), but all of the pieces for a surprisingly genuine street basketball experience are all in place. GameplayIn Street Hoops it's all about the moves. You can pass, shoot, steal, defend, block and dribble just like in any other basketball game, but since this is playground ball, there's a little extra flare in everything you do. Squeezing the right trigger turns every face button on your controller into a Mad Skillz maneuver where your player will fake shimmy and slide in the blink of an eye. When you're not in Mad Skillz mode, you've got your basic pass, shoot, crossover and spin move buttons along with turbo on the left trigger button. Left analog stick is move and C-stick, taking a page from Kobe Bryant's NBA Courtside, is for directional passing on the fly. The control scheme takes a lot of getting used to since using the Mad Skillz mode is the best way to lose defenders, but the same button that just executed that behind-the-back ball fake might be the same one that shoots the rock once you're out of Mad Skillz mode. This is street ball so there isn't much emphasis on defense, and there's no Mad Skillz mode on the right trigger when playing that part of the game, just the defensive face up. The real travesty is that you can't customize the controls. You either get used to them or are victimized. You'll see what we mean when you try to execute the awkward button combo for the alley-oop.The basketball engine of Street Hoops really comes up short. Because there's no effort to re-create the physics, pacing and authenticity of NBA basketball, Black Ops had the freedom to create the feel of playground ball, a less structured more free flowing brand of basketball. Even with these outstanding players on the roster, the basketball feels extremely unrealistic as if it's being played on a planet other than Earth. Atlanta's Run n' Shoot and New York's Rucker Park are unique places, but still bound by the same laws of gravity and inertia as the Staples Center or Madison Square Garden. The player animations are so fast that you can barely recognize one move versus another and there's no option to slow the game down. Not only that, but it's possible to have so many moves in sequence that the animations start to lose track of themselves and chop up noticeably. The inconsistent physics lead to other problems as well. Rebounding, blocking shots, knocking the ball away for steals don't work according to real world rules because the players and basketball move in different realities, it seems. One of the things that made EA's NBA Street so enjoyable was play off of the rim and other aerial maneuvers. You could count on the fact that the ball would be blocked or rebounded if you moved a player in position and hit the jump button. Street Hoops will have you wondering how, on the one hand, Half Man, Half Amazing can switch hands twice in mid-air before throwing down a reverse dunk, yet the tallest man on the court can't rebound or block a shot right in his wheelhouse? Why? Because the animation and physics are extremely well balanced for spectacular dunks, but not for other elements of the game of basketball. You'll often find your players doing things a full second late, leading to even more frustration.    This inconsistency extends to the artificial intelligence as well. More often than not a CPU opponent will pass up a wide-open shot, under the basket even, in favor of executing a pre-scripted play. That's great for paranoid high school and college coaches, but in a videogame you should be penalized for poor defense and giving up such an easy shot. The main advantage a CPU controlled player will be outside shooting accuracy. Three pointers and pull up jumpers seem super easy for the computer while your guys will have to be wide open and lucky to sink a trey even with a good outside shooter. Defense more or less comes down to which team can get the most steals since blocking, rebounding and forcing poor shots are not part of Street Hoops' arsenal. You can jar the ball loose with a vicious hand check, ala ArchRivals, or reach in for a clean steal. A combination of both is always a sure bet. The Game Modes include World Tournament, Lord of the Court and Full and Half Court Pick Up Games. The pick up games can be run with less than five players per team, while the Lord of the Court and World Tourney modes are five on five. But each game mode allows you access to the all important ~street~ elements of Street Hoops, all conveniently located on a gritty city street. You have the Barber Shop where you can get new 'dos for one or all of your players. The kids at Activision and Black Ops must know something we don't because blowout afros are apparently the most expensive haircut these days at 50 bones a pop. The Check Cashing store is where you can wager cash on your team to win, lead at half time, score the most 3 pointers, field goals, assists, etc. Gambling is always fun. The good old Pawn Shop is where you can, believe it or not, buy jewelry for your team starting with the $10,000 ~No Money~ pendant and leading up to the $200,000+ diamond bracelet-watch-chain combos. If you can't find anything wrong with this feature, then perhaps the misguided and confused Street Hoops is the game for you after all. The tattoo shop next door has some fine body art waiting for you including an ink removal service that's the most expensive job in the place. But it's the big bright lights of the in game FootAction that brings in all the money on this block. Here you choose the brand of clothing you want for your team and then the specific tops, bottoms, shoes, hats, glasses and whatnot. Snoop Dogg Clothing Co., Sean John, Enyce and Fila are just a few of the fine brands you can choose from. I like the fact that we're supposed to spend our winnings on silly things in Street Hoops but surely there's more the world of a playground legend than pawn shops and check cashing joints, right? Apparently not. Since this game is supposed to be bringing street basketball to an audience that would never otherwise experience it, it's a shame this new crowd will be getting the same old misrepresentations and stereotypes about inner city culture and about basketball (as if they're one in the same) as always. If only videogame companies would strive for such accuracy and realism in all the games they bring out. GraphicsPretty isn't a word that anybody will use to describe Street Hoops. The characters and courts are bland and flat enough that you might have a hard time convincing yourself that this is a next generation product. The player models themselves are far too angular to look like regular human players so they actually fit right in with the alien-world physics of the game. The animation is a tough one to evaluate. Meanwhile, the player animations don't always synch up with the ball and the rest of the on-court action, but there are breakthrough moments when you can really appreciate what this game is trying to pull off. The dunks are animated very well and are varied enough that you'll hardly get bored. Different players can be assigned different moved sets based on their position so that you have X amount of moves for big men, X amount for smaller players, etc. The differences are noticeable. Giving your guards Booger's moves will allow you to have a variety of creative layups from anywhere near the basket. X-Man's low post moves will give you more two-handed power dunks than you ever thought possible. This is the one are where Street Hoops really shines and you can tell that this is exactly what Black Ops intended. But the pace of some of the Mad Skillz (you can never type that enough) moves is frustrating because you sometimes lose track -- visually -- of who's in control, you or the CPU. Dribbling down onto one knee or a simple pass that becomes a quick drop and volley off of your guy's foot sound neat but can end up frustrating you. There have been no noticeable improvements made for the slightly later released GameCube version. The engine does its job, but what it does isn't particularly impressive. On the downside, there is some artifacting with the video compression for music videos and extra content.SoundHats off to Black Ops for taking the time to include Dolby Pro Logic II support in the GameCube version. It's steps up the ambience of the courts and thickens the musical backing. The licensed music from DMX, Redman and other hip-hop superstars is reproduced surprisingly clear, even at the low default volume setting. In fact, all of the on-court sounds are blended together very well. The music tracks are playing in the background throughout the game but there's plenty of other noise that could've easily muddied things a bit. You have the ambient birds and traffic, the crowd chatter, the announcers blabbering all the time, the on-court trash talking and of course the basketball sound effects to listen to. Big Boy is one hell of a morning deejay down in Los Angeles, but like Joe the Show before him in NBA Street, he takes about 20 minutes before you're ready for him to shut up; similarly, the trash talking and crowd heckling gets repetitive way too soon. You get music videos in Street Hoops with sound quality that'll make you want to start your own music video channel. Not one but two videos from Master P (the 6'3~ Percy Miller is to the NBA what Street Hoops is to Sega's NBA 2K series), a video from Xzibit (best lowriders anywhere), and one from Cypress Hill (They still do hip hop?) are just some of the fine diversions you can get into when you want to have the Street Hoops disc in your machine but you don't want to play it. You'd be surprised how handy this can be.Street Hoops was a struggle to get to know, but in the end it's not as bad as I initially thought it would be. On the surface, you see a rough looking (graphically, not socially) arcade basketball game with a ton of ambitious superficial elements. At its core, Street Hoops is a weak playground simulator with a little basketball thrown in on the side. I always thought ~Hoops~ was the operative word for this basketball videogame, but it turns out it's all about the ~Street,~ at least as much Black Ops and Activision can understand it. And this is its fundamental problem. There's not enough basketball to keep you engaged as a gamer looking for a new hoops experience and far too much attention paid to an ill-conceived representation of what life is supposed to be like for playground all-stars. An arcade game like Midway's NFL Blitz doesn't have us simulating the behavior of overly aggressive football players before a game like buying steroids or bashing a forehead into a brick wall, because those are common myths about a world many gamers may not understand and they should be required to enjoy that kind of game. It would be like buying jewelry and getting new haircuts for the playground legends in an arcade hoops game.", "date": "Dec 10, 2002"}
