It was the game that was supposed to make you say  ~I loved Halo so this one will be just as good!~ It took several delays and returns to the drawing board but Brute Force has finally made it to the Xbox and in fine shape. It looks the part of an Xbox first party title with outstanding visuals and mature themes and should help flesh out the system's still struggling library.   The developers at Digital Anvil have delivered Brute Force with plenty of polish and the game is genuinely fun. The only catch is that it isn't a good squad-based tactical action game as advertised. The genre of squad-based tactical action is relatively new and so any definitions you may want to throw out there might work, but Brute Force ends up feeling very much like a run-and-gun action title instead of a game that requires a lot of strategic thinking. Now the run-and-gun of Brute Force is plenty fun and very well executed but it's just not what we or anybody else who's bought into MS's marketing message is expecting from this game. If you're just all about a good time blasting aliens then Brute Force shouldn't be a problem. If you were looking for some more squad-based tactical shooting along the lines of Conflict: Desert Storm then this game comes up a bit short.  Gameplay  The premise behind Brute Force is that you're in control of a team of four unique commandos who've come together to meet a threat to the galaxy as we know it. Each character has unique attributes, special abilities and weapon options. Ostensibly your job is to use the correct soldier in the right situation whilst keeping the entire team alive. You're allowed to switch control from one teammate to another with a flick of the D-pad and issue commands to all of your teammates via a special command menu you can access by holding a direction on the D-pad. You're in control of one and only one commando at any time so knowing when to switch to which is the key. Here's what each has to offer:    Hawk: carries one light rifle and one side arm; smallest health meter; can turn invisible; only character that can use power blade melee attack (very nice while invisible). Flint: sniper carries one light rifle and one side arm; second smallest health meter; auto-targeting special ability means you barely have to aim to hit targets and she excels at one shot kills Tex: heavy firepower dude carries heavy weapons only; largest health meter; can disarm mines and use them later; berserker special ability allows him to use both weapons at the same time.  Brutus: feral warrior carries a heavy weapon and a light rifle; second largest health meter; special ability gives him thermal visions, regenerates health and devastating charge attack.    There are so many similarities between Brute Force and Halo that we could wrap up this review right here and now with a checklist of features in common. Brute Force is played from the third person perspective --just like Halo used to be-- but the controls are nearly identical to Bungie's first-person shooter. Each character can only carry two weapons, switch between them on Y and pick up new ones off of the ground using X. Grenades are defaulted to the left trigger but you can assign other items there like mines or other special explosives. Sadly, there's no flashlight button to be found.  Since you spend a lot of time running and gunning, the control system allows you some pretty nifty and agile moves using the analog stick and primary weapon fire on the right trigger. The frantic play is further encouraged by a quick medpack button so you can take a dose of health (if you have any available) in the middle of a firefight like we saw in Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance. Each of the four main character's special abilities is defaulted to the white button so you can slip into and out of their powers quickly. You can even command your teammates to use their powers and take medpacks from the command menu where you'll also find the four basic ~stand ground,~ ~cover me,~ ~fire at will~ and ~move here~ commands. The fact that the control system is aimed at keeping things quick and easy is the strongest indication of how you're expected to enjoy Brute Force. The artificial intelligence of your teammates whilst playing solo is the second strongest indication.  The strategy elements of Brute Force fall apart early on when you realize the AI of your squad mates isn't what it should be when you're playing by yourself. The basic commands above represent the totality of the control you have over your teammates but it doesn't feel like enough. ~Fire at will~ and ~cover me,~ for example, are more like aggressiveness settings than actual commands. ~Fire at will~ means they'll go looking for trouble while ~cover me~ is more akin to ~stick close to me so you don't get yourself hurt, idiot.~ Move is actually very effective since selecting this command will take you back to the main game interface with a big blue arrow to help you point to potential locations to send your troops. You can even send them to higher or lower ground with no problems. Unfortunately ~stand ground~ ends up being the most popular command because you'll use it to keep the other three in one place while you go handle your business against the bad guys.       Most scenarios will involve you hiding Flint and Hawk somewhere safe (feminists somewhere out there should be pissed) while you take Brutus and or Tex into a hostile environment to whoop ass since they have the most firepower and can take the most damage. You can then bring the two female characters up whenever its safe and you want to pull off something cool. Setting up quick ambushes or controlling the battlefield with superior tactics are basic components of tactical squad based games, but Brute Force undermines this with ~loose~ enemy and teammate AI that seems geared towards pure action and trigger pulling. Your sniper is good if you want to take out enemies at a distance, of course, just don't rely on her AI to cover you on its own when you put her on a hill because she won't know how to zoom in on enemies on her own.  Basically it's like a game where you can pick from four unique characters and take them into battle yourself, but the difference with Brute Force is the other three you didn't pick are in the game with you ready to be picked on a whim as long as you keep them alive. This is not tactical action gaming. Fortunately things really pick up in Brute Force the less you have to rely on AI controlled teammates.  System Link cooperative play through the main campaign is Brute Force's greatest and only triumph over Halo. You and three buddies can hop on four Xboxes and ride through the single player story controlling members of the same Brute Force squad. Despite the choppiness that comes up, this is the definitive BF experience since you've got your own screen and you can simply yell at the knucklehead controlling Brutus instead of yelling at the AI controlling him when he does something dumb. If you choose to do three Xboxes and three buddies, one of you will always be able to command or switch to that fourth character as you proceed through the game's 20+ hours of campaign mode. But it doesn't have to all be cooperative.   You've got standard deathmatch and squad deathmatch in Brute Force. Of the two, the latter is the bigger deal since you can take your BF squad against your buddy's squad and see who's really the man or the woman. Throughout the single player campaign you'll be able to unlock new characters that can then be used in the game's multiplayer games. So while there's the Brute Force squad made up of Tex, Brutus, Hawk and Flint there's also four-man squads of Ferals (Brutus' homies), Seers, Shrikes and Federation troops. You can max out both types of deathmatch games with eight players spread across four Xboxes so that you have to two players splitting a screen (and a squad in squad DM) on each TV. That's as close as you can get to Xbox Live without crossing the line The way you can divvy up players, Xboxes and squads over system link and splitscreen gets a little confusing but it's safe to say no other game makes better use of that system link cable than Brute Force.    Graphics  Brute Force is one of the most impressive looking games on the Xbox period. As long as you stay away from the multiplayer games with all kinds of action going on, the framerate is surprisingly steady considering how much is happening even in an empty environment. There are nice subtle weather and lighting effects that really bring the missions to life when you stop and take the time to appreciate them. The animation on all of the characters is a little stiff and this is probably the biggest graphical weakness. Explosions, weapon effects and everything else you'd expect from an action shooter are all well done.  The worlds of Brute Force look like something from an old episode of Star Trek. Early on you're treated to a volcanic environment with all kinds of floating fireflies/lights hovering in place and you can get your James T. Kirk on by ignore them and blowing everybody to hell. Brutus' homeworld is made up of cities built among towering trees that seem to have no tops or roots but are very convincingly drawn. The real treat is later on you blast through a level where the roots of those trees seem to be growing and the whole thing makes for quite a sight.   The characters themselves aren't bad looking but the fact that the same models are used during the movie sequences makes them seem hokier than necessary. It would've been nicer if the female characters looked more like what they represented. That is, it's very clear that Tex is the double-fisted tough guy because he's got a big ass gun on his back and one in his hand; Brutus is the hostile, yet kind-hearted primal dude because he has scales and red eyes; but Hawk and Flint are damn near interchangeable. Their outfits, hairstyles and weapon configurations are identical so that only Flint's darker skin and hair color give her away.  The main characters and enemies share far too many animations and this becomes very apparent eight hours into the main campaign mode.  Sound  The music and voice acting is cheesy but very appropriate for the game's vibe. If the jokes written into the dialogue were just a bit funnier it would be easier to see that BF is not trying to take itself too seriously . As it is however, the music and quality of voice acting (delivering corny lines) have you convinced that this is some serious sci-fi even if you know better.   The weapon sound effects are unique enough and the surround sound capabilities of the Xbox make a huge difference. While the AI of the enemies in Brute Force is nowhere near what the Covenant showed us in Halo, they do have some decent lines that you'll even be able to hear in the middle of a ferocious firefight. Few things can be better than listening to a bunch of cannibalistic mutants with Molotov cocktails screaming about what they're going to do to you if they ever find you.   The music sounds like something from a 1980s knock-off sci-fi show but again it fits well with what Brute Force is doing. It doesn't change according to events in the game like the music in Halo, but you will recognize the consistent hokiness throughout your time with BF.  Brute Force works well as a rich action-shooter but it just doesn't have the brains to get by as a tactical squad-based anything. The command system and other strategic elements Digital Anvil tried to implement end up seeming out of place because there's so much mindless fun to be had. What it does, it does well with a nice polished look, solid control and slew of other good habits inherited from Halo so it's definitely a good Xbox game to have in your library. It pushes the envelope of system link functionality and meets the multiplayer requirement with ease. I'm not sure if we'll still be playing this years from now the same way we all still play Halo, but this should get us at least halfway through the summer.", "date": "May 28, 2003"}
