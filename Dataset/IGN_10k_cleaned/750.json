As a sport, Darts ranks right up there with Bowling and Quarters. But as anybody knows, there's something very cathartic about a simple game of skill, and Vatical's new Pro Darts translates that basic amusement well into a plain but addictive game of skill and chance.   Features:   Six different game modes (including Around the World, Cricket, 301, and 501) Three computer skill levels. Six main players to choose from, each with different skills in accuracy, power, speed, and nerves. Two hidden dart players Digitized voice for scoring and special shots. Rendered animation of player's hands. Impressive full motion video intro scene. Challenge the CPU or a friend (without the need of a link cable). Available on Game Boy Color only.    If you can remember the NES game Magic Darts, you know how habit-forming a game of Darts can be. Vatical's game doesn't have all of the magic of that classic -- the characters are bizarre, but aren't as strange and well thought out as those robots and monkeys -- but it does have the same compulsive game play and skill level.  Playing Pro Darts is a lot like playing bowling or golf games. A hand swings on screen twice diagonally, the once up and down, and finally shakes with a power meter, and players tap in time to line up shots. What makes the game interesting every time is that each character is rated in four different skill levels -- accuracy, power, speed, and nerves. A nervous player will flutter his hand trying to aim. A powerful player will be able to arc a dart when his hand is turned up. And an inaccurate dart player will probably land one in his foot.  Graphically, Pro Darts needed some work. Sure, the intro cut scene (a full motion video of a dart slicing across a room and cracking up a board) is first-rate, and the rendered hand animation is crisp and clean. On the other hand, however, the board doesn't zoom in after a dart is thrown, so while the X that lingers after a dart lands marks your place, it's difficult to see exactly where the dart struck. And while effort has gone into creating interesting characters, they do not appear in gameplay -- the parrot character even has a human hand while playing. And don't think that just because this game is simple that it should play on the Game Boy Pocket -- the graphic effects and voice samples make this a Game Boy Color game only.  But Pro Darts is a budget title -- under $20 -- and you certainly get your money's worth with the game. Even if you get bored with it, it has that Tetris quality that makes it good for keeping in your Game Boy travel case. With a half dozen variations on the sport and a very challenging computer opponent that constantly challenges, this little game is what Game Boy was made for.", "date": "Mar 2, 2000"}
