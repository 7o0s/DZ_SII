His Mah Jong bag is full of special tiles imbued with secret powers. He must use these special tiles to clear 30 puzzle screens and seek revenge against the foul trio of serpents. It's a fun little hook that helps out what could have been a basic mobile mah jong game.   Each stage drops a different pattern of tiles for you to clear. Each puzzle has a solution (or two), but you can indeed find yourself in dead-end situations if you aren't thoughtful about tile-clearing choices. A helpful on-screen hint lets you know how many possible matches you have on-screen. When that number drops to one, you really need to scan the screen to see if the next move will open up a new possibility or if you need to use the ~undo~ feature to backtrack to a better junction.   The ultimate goal is to uncover two ying-yang tiles at the bottom of the stack. If you match these two tiles, you win the board. You do not need to remove all of the other tiles in order to solve the puzzle, but you'll certainly bank extra points for making as many matches as possible before pairing the ying and yang tiles.   As you progress deeper in the game, you earn the aforementioned special tiles, such as bombs that let you eliminate a tile elsewhere on the screen or a magnet that pulls a new to a new location. These power-ups offer some new mechanics, but they aren't obtrusive to the actual enjoyment of mah jong.   The game looks good. I played it on a RAZR V9 and had no trouble identifying tiles and making matches. The backdrops are detailed, but not distracting.  Mah Jong Quest is an addictive little game, but keep in mind that I am a fan of mah jong titles. If you have zero interest in tile-matching, you'll be better served elsewhere. However, if you share my enthusiasm for the genre, you definitely need to give this one a download.", "date": "Nov 7, 2007"}
