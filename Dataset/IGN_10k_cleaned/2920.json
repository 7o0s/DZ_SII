That was a bit of a high-concept piece -- see, the secret to expressing strong opinions in a generally reticent business is to just make sure you deliver them two at a time, so there's something for everyone to agree with.  And Gungrave does tend to inspire strong opinions, in either direction, on a number of different points.  Despite its modern visual presentation, third-person 3D, this is a shooter of the kind that went well out of style in the last generation of games, a straightforward blaster with some interesting kinks in the form of its defense and combo systems.  It is meant to be played with one thumb firmly planted on the fire button at all times, with other concerns remaining secondary or indeed nonexistent, and it's not an especially lengthy game, although its level design and reward structure do inspire repeat play.  The question debated by the Good and Evil Doktors in our earlier review remains.  Do such top-notch aesthetic qualities -- for this is inarguably a gorgeous game with a swinger of a soundtrack -- make up for the fact that it isn't all that complicated and doesn't actually last all that long?  There are bound to be plenty of different answers to that one, but for my part, I'm ready to bite the bullet and give this a thumbs-up.  Yes, it's maybe two hours long at the outside, but I loved that two hours, and I recognize the skill that went into making those two hours as much fun as they were.  If you want more than that, well, go read somebody else's review.  Gameplay Okay, see those guys over there?  Hit the fire button until they stop moving.  There is, of course, more to it than that, although it is worth noting that the main wrinkle in Gungrave is a system that offers a bonus to players who refuse to let up on the fire button.  Every shot that hits the mark counts up on the ~Beat~ combo meter, gradually climbing into the dozens and even hundreds of shots, provided there's no break in the continuous chain of destruction.  The game charitably provides an awful lot to shoot, with continuous waves of enemies and all sorts of background objects to wreck, but developing the best combos actually requires some thought regarding mastery of the controls and understanding of the level patterns to make sure there's never a break in the chain.  Long combos, in addition to looking good on the end-of-level performance tally, rack up stocks on the Demolition Shot meter.  Those can be spent on refilling our hero Grave's limited life meter, or expended to fire one of several immensely destructive smart-bomb attacks.  Those are of course handy for blowing hell out of the bad guys, but on the other hand, they automatically break the current combo, making them a last resort for boss battles or tight situations.  Combos and Demolition Shots are further tied together, however, by those performance tallies -- racking up top-notch combos is part of the scheme for acquiring badder and better Demolition Shots between levels.  Meanwhile, there's a reasonably clever scheme for reckoning Grave's resistance to damage.  He's a pretty tough guy, capable of shrugging off an awful lot of punishment, but once enough attacks in a short period of time break down his blue defense meter, his red life meter can start dropping awfully rapidly.  Thus, after a heavy firefight, he has to take some time off to let the defense meter refill (it does so automatically, given a break in the action), but this again ties back in to the combo system -- pulling out of the action usually breaks a combo.  And taking damage (or using a Demolition Shot stock to refill Grave's life) of course stands as a mark against you when it comes to adding up performance at the end of a level and picking up new special attacks.  Finishing Gungrave isn't an exceptionally difficult task, as has been made abundantly clear in earlier coverage of the game.  Its levels have a moderate difficulty curve, and it has some clever boss designs to challenge players until they master the patterns of attack required to win, but finishing the game still won't take very long.  However, completing Gungrave in the clean and stylish fashion of an expert player is another matter entirely.  I'm perplexed as to why I feel a desire to develop skill at this game, while SOCOM's similar challenge to ~make the grade~ held no attraction at all.  Perhaps that's because the concepts involved are less complex, perhaps a bit less ephemeral.  As I say, while this may look like a modern 3D shooter, it's far closer in spirit to a 16- or 32-bit 2D game (think back, for example, to Radiant Silvergun's combo system), with more straightforward concepts to understand and master.  Another comparison to wonder about would be the rift between this and my reaction to Z.O.E, whose repetitive action drove me to distraction.  That game offered very little framework to define a skilled player's abilities and give them room to grow, though, like Gungrave's combo system.  The few occasions when it did do something like that, such as its brief defensive missions, were when it was closest to capturing my sustained interest.  If, of course, you see no reason to genuinely master a shooter over repeated times through, than Gungrave probably won't prove worth your investment, unless its aesthetic qualities make the nut (more on that in a moment).  Its occasionally glitchy camera movement and collision detection may also prove problematic -- it would have been quite preferable to see completely free camera control on the right analog stick, rather than simply supplementing the automatic movements with an automatic center feature.  Gamers who've been waiting to see this style of gameplay come back, however, should find it quite engaging.    Graphics Yasuhiro Nightow, of Trigun fame, and Kosuke Fujishima, noted artist of a great many popular Japanese comics, contributed substantially to the design of Gungrave's characters and world.  This should mean either a great deal or nothing at all to the observer, depending on whether they're familiar with these gentlemen's work.  Whether or not you're a fan of the specific names involved, though, this is a pretty sweet piece of visual design all around, from the flat 2D art to the pre-rendered movies to the game world itself.  It's a little Dark Knight, a little Wild West, maybe a little Blade Runner...there are plenty of comparisons to be made.  Long and the short of it, though, is it's cool.  There are moments in Gungrave with as pure an ~awwwwww, yeaaaaaah~ quality as the best bits in Devil May Cry or Metal Gear Solid 2.  The game engine proper holds up in almost perfect order, although the resolution and framerate do take a hit at particularly frenetic moments.  Often, though, slowdown happens when it actually works to dramatic effect, as when Grave pops off a Demolition Shot at a good-sized crowd of bad guys.  And most of the time, it's just smooth, continuous shooting, with sharp lighting from the muzzle flashes, smoke and particles from the explosions and ricochets, big chunks of the environment coming to pieces, texture decals for bulletholes and shrapnel, all that good destructive stuff.  Grave is the one notably detailed character model on screen at any given time, since most of the cannon fodder are given comparatively short shrift in the modeling department.  They look good enough for their purpose, however, given that they're only there to be wasted in a split second or two, and die with suitably amusing contortions.  The boss characters, meanwhile, are almost all wonderfully twisted designs, in the best classic shooter tradition.  The one significant opponent who doesn't look like much at first sight makes up for that with some ridiculously nifty cutscene attacks.  It would be nice, however, if Grave had a few more moves in his repertoire.  He has one nifty twisting maneuver where he sets himself to fire an extra barrage of rapid blasts, but while it's a nice piece of animation, it plays so many times throughout the game that one wonders why the artists didn't bother to compose a few more variations on the theme.  Between that and his extra Demolition Shot maneuvers, he actually doesn't have many animations beyond his simple walking, running, and Max Payne diving rolls.  A character design that looks this good standing still ought to have a few more equally stylish moves.  Sound The one entirely inarguable point as far as Gungrave is concerned: this is an excellent score.  Tsuneo Imahori, composer of the funky western/rock/folk/samba hybrid sound in the anime Trigun, here goes for more of a big-band sound at times, with lots of blaring horns over weighty bass.  There are also more conventional electronic tracks, which are nevertheless composed with respectable skill, and a touch of the folk style he occasionally pulls out for something like NieA Under Seven.  The result is an eclectic, original soundtrack where one would normally expect relatively uniform, semi-inspiring techno or hard rock (not to be confused with the truly inspiring electronica of SSX or the mighty rock of Guilty Gear, mind you).  The tempo of the music, of course, is frequently drowned under the rhythmic chung-chung-chung of Grave's twin guns.  Those responsible for the sound effects in this game knew the importance of a distinctive gunshot in a situation of this kind, where it's likely to be the most common sound by a fair margin.  This one has a nice texture to it, relatively low in comparison to some, so it doesn't grate on the ears like a higher sound would.  Punctuating the continuous gunfire are similarly meaty explosions, with the odd bit of clashing metal to accompany the basic ka-boom.  Another nice detail is the retention of Japanese voices -- thanks to Sega of America for a nod in the direction of the die-hard geeks that will likely make up most of this game's following. Here is what it boils down to: shooting things is fun.  Shooting things, when properly presented, is one hell of a lot of fun, and Gungrave presents more shooting packed more densely with more impressive style than just about any other game in the last several years.  Not even Devil May Cry comes quite this far in the style department, and in comparison, it certainly doesn't measure up in the continuous-shooting department, containing as it did far too many unforgivable lapses in the tempo of gunfire.Going into Gungrave, then, recognize that this is a straightforward old-school shooter with a bit of depth to master and a few forgivable flaws, and things should go just fine.  If you demand more length and depth from your games nowadays, and there's nothing wrong with that, go forth and sin no more.  There are certainly plenty of other games to receive your attention.  For now, however, I have a fever, and I believe the only prescription is shooting things.", "date": "Sep 13, 2002"}
