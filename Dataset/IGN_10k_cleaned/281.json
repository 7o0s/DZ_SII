The sweetness comes from the fact that DD on the PSX was a fun crash 'em up game and pretty unique when it came out three years ago. The bitter taste comes up because it's now 1999 and the genre isn't fresh anymore and the N64 version is a shadow of the outdated PSX game. DD64 has had a tough time just making it to the N64 over the last 18 months or so with development duties being passed from Psygnosis to Looking Glass Studios and publishing being picked up by THQ. In the end, the game shows its age and seems as weathered and battered as some of the losing vehicles in the game.  Features  More than 12 initial stock cars to race and crash with; Even more production-style vehicles open up as players progress through the game for a total of 24. Real-time damage to vehicles. Realistic physics engine. A wide selection of tracks and arenas -- more than 12 in all. Multiple gameplay modes including ~Hot Potato~ and Capture the Flag.  Two-, three- and four-player carnage.   Gameplay Find the A and B buttons and the trigger and you'll have all of the weapons you'll need to get through this Destruction Derby 64 since all you'll need to do is accelerate, brake and look behind you.  The premise is that you're a hybrid demolition driver and racer that can race with the best of them but you can also get mean and nasty if you have to. In the single player Championship mode, you'll run a gauntlet of ~races~ that will earn you points towards medals which will allow you to unlock the cool tracks and cars.  The circuits themselves are made up of several races on road courses and a handful of competitions in demolition arenas. The road races end up being the bulk of your experiences in this game and they just aren't fun enough. The first problem with the road races is that there are only a handful of tracks. Some of them are reversed and/or raced at night so each one is considered a ~new~ track. The arenas are more fun because they facilitate more crashing which is what we thought this game was supposed to be about. The first arena track available, The Junkyard, proves to be more fun than the ones you'll unlock later on.  The road races are setup so that groups of cars start at different points on the track loop with each group racing in a different direction. The chaos that's there at the beginning of the race is pretty catastrophic. The first time your group of four cars meets up with a group of four cars racing headlong in the opposite direction is usually pretty messy with some fine head-on collisions and explosions. The thing as the race wears on, maybe your third or fourth time around the track, there are fewer cars that you'll encounter because they've blown up somewhere along the way and so there will be fewer and fewer opportunities for accidents. This boils down to a lot of lonely racing around unimpressive tracks with only an occasional burning wreck to look at. .  The arena competitions on the other hand give you the destruction that you'd expect from this game. The arenas are more or less circular and wide open with some structures strategically placed to spice up the action a little bit. The Junkyard has an elevated second tier that's good for pushing people off of or you can use it to jump onto other racers. This is where destruction is the most important because it's the only way to score points and that should be plenty of incentive.   The point scoring system for the road races is actually very interesting and could perhaps be applied to other games. It's a race only in that you're competing with other guys on a track, but there's really no number of laps to complete or goals to reach. You get points for passing checkpoints in a timely manner and for bashing into other cars. The winner of the race is determined by who has the most points by the time they stop racing. How do you stop racing? You either get blown up from too much damage or you fail to reach a checkpoint before time runs out. The emphasis is placed on simply staying alive and healthy enough to compete and rack up points. You have to balance survival with attacking since your opponents will stop racking up points if you incapacitate them. It's possible to be knocked out of the race less than one or two laps into it and still win since you can rack up tons of destruction points and just hope that none of your competitors catches up to you.  This brings us up the points about strategy.  With the selection of default cars available in the beginning, you will have to learn to race backwards. The early cars have very vulnerable front ends so lots of head on collisions will cause a huge amount of damage and knock you out early. Bashing into your competitors with the back end though is a nice way to take minimal damage while handing out some pain. This is true for both the road races and arena battles. The thing is that you go a bit slower in reverse than when you're driving forward so you may barely miss making a few checkpoints in the road races due to the lack of speed. The recommended philosophy is to drive normally and try to rack up as many head-on collision points as you can before your damage meter gets too low. Once it does get low, turn that sucker around and drive the remainder of the race backwards. As you advance in the game, you'll unlock cars with different skills like the almighty taxi cab. It can literally drive through other cars and smash them while taking a minimal damage hit.  The physics are a little more bouncy and arcadey as compared to the PSX versions of the game. You can get hit at the right angle and go spinning up into the air and still land on all fours like a cat and keep going. We happen to like things like this in any vehicle game but it's not what cars really do. The physics seemed geared to the destruction elements of the game with back ends popping up and some two wheel action on small crashes. You can mash the gas on the early cars and just steer hard on the sharp turns with no problems so there's no incentive to adjust speed to go through turns cleanly. The physics are all about crashing and smashing not racing.  The four player matches are fun, but only if you and your buddies have mastered the skills of the game. First off, stick to the arena battles because if you thought racing against the computer was lonely, you may only see your buddies once or twice on the road course races. In the multiplayer arena battles it usually works out where you'll all bash and crash without  regard to who you're hitting until you realize that all of the drones are gone and you and your friends are all that's left. That's when the fun starts, but sometimes you'll find that the arenas are too big and you spend a lot of time turning around after missing a collision on the initial pass. The bomb tag and capture the flag games are arena only and really rely on advanced arena battle skills. The bomb tag isn't quite hectic enough for us but it can be fun for beginning players. For our money the capture the flag game is the best part of Destruction Derby 64. When you get multiple players and drones working together (or at least trying to) to grab the flag, protect the flag bearer and deliver back to the base while still stopping the other team from doing the same, you're getting the best this game has to offer. There's soccer and football strategy all rolled into one and some fine drone A.I. They'll try to block you from achieving your goals and often do so at the last minute. Also there's nothing like racing towards the goal with the flag on top of your car and watching one of your drone player's clear out an oncoming defender like a pulling guard on a football field. Great.  Graphics There's some slowdown when you get the multiplayer games going with a lot of drones and destruction on the screen. Smoke effects from damaged and burning cars also cause a lot of frames to be lost. Beyond this choppiness there's also a rough grainy look to the game that makes the cars look loose and jaggy. It may be an intentional effect to capture the rough gritty world of demolition racing, but we doubt it. It ends up looking a lot like the Playstation version which isn't a good thing in this case.  On the bright side, DD64 is one of the few N64 games to feature vehicle damage and that's a bit refreshing. The downside is that there are may be a total of ten damage models for all of the cars. You can have a slightly damaged front end, severely damaged front end and missing hood but not much beyond that if you consistently crash the front end. At times the hood would seem to be missing even when we hadn't crashed into anything. Other than that, most of the cars look a lot a like with the paint job and number being the only distinguishing characteristic.  The bland backgrounds and flat textures even on the glitzy urban tracks leave a lot to be desired. The backgrounds and car interactions are such that when you're chasing a car ahead of you you'll see a shimmering blurb of color on the horizon while you race into the environment. As you gain on the little rascal you'll see the blurb of color getting bigger and bigger until you can finally make out that it's a vehicle of some sort.    One thing that you can't help but notice is that when you crash into other vehicles, appropriately colored sheets of confetti-like damage come flying off in every direction. We know they're supposed to be flimsy demolition cars, but who knew that they were made of confetti paper? Also you'll be able to tell that the roads, ramps and other structures are crudely repeated textures only minimal efforts have been made to conceal this.   Sound Videogames have had some strange music before but we can't quite figure out the origin for some of the tunes in DD64. It may be a bit redundant to say hollowed-out techno music, but that's exactly what most of the songs in this game sound like. Maybe it's something about demolition derbies that we don't know, but we have a hard time believing that fans of such events like music with pulsating beats and synthesized whale song. If you're going to do some high energy frantic type futuristic music for your racing game, the music from Wipeout 64 is a good place to get your inspiration.  You get help from a little disembodied announcer fellow throughout races and he sounds like your favorite TV game show host. He'll be the one to tell you how many cars are left in a race and how much time you don't have to make it to the next checkpoint. He also throws in the occasional smart remark like, ~you didn't need that fender anyway,~ when you bump into a wall for no reason and scratch up your ride.  The crashing, wrecking, engine, and explosion sounds are all well done. You get the full sound of each and you can even hear the whine of other vehicles when they roll by.   Destruction Derby arrived late to the N64 but it's not better. It would have been a nice first effort if it had come out a few years ago, but after vehicle combat games like Vigilante 8 did so much for the genre, DD64 seems to come up short in many areas. The vehicle damage, while a welcome sight, isn't enough to forgive the lack of graphics sophistication. The single player games aren't fun enough to sustain my attention in any mode on any setting. As we said the best part is the multiplayer Capture the Flag game but even that may not make it worth a rental.", "date": "Oct 2, 1999"}
