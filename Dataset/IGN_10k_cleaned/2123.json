But in terms of gameplay, it's hard to make any new innovations; anyone that still makes this venerable type of game either adds a new weapon for your ship or blankets the screen with crazy amounts of enemy fire.  There's nothing wrong with that, though I wish those companies that decide to make a 2D shooter look beyond giving the standard gameplay additions of weapon fire and enemy numbers.  Psikyo, probably the leading 2D shooter company in terms of sheer number of 2D shooters they've put out, have decided to venture from their usual format of 2D shooter by giving gamers a little more control in the import Dreamcast title Zero Gunner 2.  Like any good shooter, the world is being terrorized by some very well-armed evildoers.  Choose from three different attack choppers and blast the baddies into smithereens.  Each ship has its own strengths in speed, though they're all about the same in firepower; the only different in the weapons is essentially what suits your style.  Some may prefer the weak but homing secondary missiles of the Hokum while others might prefer the piercing lasers of the Comanche.  The powering up of your primary weapons hasn't changed, as Psikyo uses the basic Sesame Street lesson in shooting ~one of these planes that's not like the others~ to get your power-up;  and yes, you have to play ~catch the power-up~ in this game.  As for your bomb weapon (or as Anoop likes to call it, the ~panic button~), every time you shoot down enemies, they release these green crystals marked with an ~E~.  Keep grabbing these crystals, especially the big ones as they fill up your bomb meter.  As you fill your bomb meter, a icon will indicate how many times you can use your special bomb attack.  Those that have played other Psikyo classics like Strikers 1945 will obviously be used to all the play mechanics (hail to the Flying Pancake!)  What makes ZG2 so unique is the very cool ~turn marker system~.  It would be silly for a helicopter not to have the ability to turn around while still flying backwards.  ZG2 implements this ability when you press the B (or X) button.  When you press the B button, a green targeting cursor appears on the screen and as long as you hold the B button, it'll stay on the screen.  By holding this button, you'll be able to turn you ship 360 degrees while still flying forward.  It's kind of hard to explain but think of the green targeting cursor as a  ~virtual anchor~ with an invisible line linked to your ship.  While holding the B button you can rotate the ship by pressing left or right.  This enables you to keep a lock on the enemy your shooting at while circling the target to avoid incoming fire.  This play mechanic becomes a necessity in later levels; while the game is presented mostly in vertical scrolling fashion, the game will periodically shift to a horizontal scrolling format.  It doesn't take too long to get used to and once you do, it's one of the cooler play mechanics I've seen in this genre.  And as many shooter fans may know, Psikyo's 2D shooter titles aren't very easy either so the turn marker system becomes a key tool to use against the onslaught of enemies.  Although Zero Gunner 2 is a 2D shooter by nature, the visuals are mostly 3D.  There are some really nice special effects that give you the feeling of depth and speed, but it isn't the best looking 2D shooter I've seen; I think that accolade is reserved for games like Soukyugurentai and Radiant Silvergun.  Like all Psikyo shooters, the end bosses are very large robots that transform from their secretive vehicular disguise.  Although the textures aren't that great, the enemy bosses animate very well.  Backgrounds are all 3D and there are some pretty crazy looking backgrounds in the later levels of the game. I also like how they incorporate the 3D nature of the backgrounds so you can hide behind structures to avoid enemy fire.  Like any 2D shooter, the biggest obstacle to overcome is longterm playability.  Zero Gunner 2 is pretty lackluster in this department; with only a ranking mode as the only extra, ZG2 isn't recommended for those looking for a longterm investment in terms of gameplay hours filled with unlocking new secrets and levels.  Zero Gunner 2 is for that hardy import Dreamcast gamer that still enjoys 2D shooters but needs a little ~twist~.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Sep 24, 2001"}
