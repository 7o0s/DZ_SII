Of course, if any brand could pull off such a feat, it would be Nintendo's Pokemon -- enter Pokemon Channel.The Facts Watch Pokemon themed programming Interact with Pikachu Buy Pokemon paraphernalia from the shopping network Answer trivia for PokeCash Talk with wild PokemonGameplayA spiritual successor of Hey You, Pikachu!, Channel drops the microphone and lousy voice recognition software for a somewhat less clunky cursor interface, which is used to interact with Pikachu and your new world. Taking a cue from the popularity of plunking kids in front of the TV, Channel gives you the opportunity to watch ~TV~ on your very own television. Excitement for everyone. However, this unglamorous past time turned videogame does actually have a goal. You've been recruited by Professor Oak as a test audience for the new Pokemon Channel Television Network, which specializes in TV for Pokemon. Your job is to watch the available programming and report to Oak whether Pikachu enjoyed a given show -- which will help Oak decide what kind of programming to air.After reading this long spiel from Oak, you're forced to watch a segment from the Pokemon Channel exclusive anime, PichuBros.. After this mandatory viewing, you'll be able to explore the TV and room at your leisure. Your primary focus is your TV set. Here you can access programs like the Pokemon News Flash (anchored by Psyduck and reported by Meowth), Shop 'N Squirtle (shopping network), Quiz Obbuffet (compete in trivia for cash), Smoochum Shape-Up (aerobic exercise), Weather Channel, and Smeargle's Art Show. Most programs are just fluff. They inform you of facts you may or may not know about Pokemon, but it isn't all that informative or entertaining. Most programming isn't worth watching more than once, and you rarely find enjoyment from watching it once. The trivia questions are easy enough that you can usually guess the correct answer -- even if you know nothing of Pokemon. The only worthwhile programming is the PichuBros. because it's actually has some level of merit.The Pokemon centered anime is decent and the presentation resembles the cartoon that currently airs on Fox -- although PichuBros. doesn't have a powerful plot. The redeeming quality is that you can capture any screen from the show and then paint it using your Smeargle paint kit. While the colors and tools are rather limited, it's a neat prospect that's sure to keep kids entertained. You can choose to auction off the paintings you've created for cash (which you can then use to buy stuff from the shopping network) and the artwork you've created will be critiqued by Smeargle on his art show. Also, you'll be able to upload images to paint and patterns for the paint tool with the e-reader.Unfortunately, even if you're sick of watching TV and you want to explore your surroundings, Pikachu will demand that you turn the TV back on. Even though Pikachu will follow the aerobics on screen, learn to sing, or hop about in excitement while viewing -- you'll often wish you had a more active role in the proceedings.If you're lucky enough to escape the warm glow of the tube, then you can command Pikachu to check out various nooks, crates, and items lying around your room. Sometimes he'll climb onto your bed, other times he'll sniff flowers, or he'll even find useful items. One such treasure is a Pokemon Mini cartridge. You can play these Mini Games in your Pokemon Mini -- they're usually not very complex and are based on timing button presses, but they make a nice diversion. Even when you're not gaming on your Pokemon Mini, you can find other things to occupy your time. Wander outside and you can talk to various Pokemon hanging around your backyard. If you answer the question they ask you correctly, they'll hand over a Nice Card (electronic trading card) for your collection.While outside, Pikachu can also be coerced into eating fruit he finds in boxes. If he eats a banana, he'll toss the peel on the ground. You can then force him to walk over it and get a chuckle when he falls on his face. Otherwise, your time outside is spent searching for objects that Pikachu can interact with. Even other towns (you can hop on a bus if you own the appropriate pass) offer little in terms of entertainment besides for tracking down all the wild Pokemon.Even the Chao nature of Channel only uses the simplistic elements. Make sure Pikachu is happy (which means don't force him to leave his precious TV and make sure he's fed). It's not a very difficult or amusing task -- and borders on annoying.Although this game is incredibly simple, and you'll be hard pressed to find adults that will be entertained by the title, this is meant for children. In that respect, Pokemon Channel does work well because the interface is fairly intuitive (if still a tad clunky), there are plenty of instructions, and it will probably take budding PokeFans a while to tire of the mindless entertainment.GraphicsNintendo has continued its tradition of simple presentation for its franchises. Textures are incredibly simple and bland -- granted that it follows the Pokemon art style. The bright colors do add to the kid friendly, care free atmosphere, but it certainly doesn't showcase what the GameCube is capable of. Animation is rather limited. Pokemon all have their standard waddle across the screen and perhaps a static animation, but as you wander abroad you'll soon grow tired of the non-existent variety. The only real visual spice is Pikachu, who is equipped with the full range of happy, angry, sad facial animations (like Hey You, Pikachu!). Pikachu also takes part in head butting the TV, aerobics, and other actions that will occasionally make you smile.SoundAgain, Nintendo has kept up with its conscious effort to keep voice acting out of its games. A lot of text will be read during the course of this game. The only reprieve is the accurate portrayal of Pokemon as they spout off their catch phrases like, ~pika, pika~ or ~squirtle, squirtle~. The repetition gets annoying, but at least it's accurate to the franchise. When you're not watching the anime, you're treated to a melody of Pokemon inspired tunes that compliment both the wandering and the TV watching. Not the most entertaining of audio tracks, but it gets the job done.Pokemon Channel makes watching TV boring. I can hardly find enough compelling gameplay to call this a game. It's far too passive an experience to keep my interest for more than a few minutes -- especially since I'm forced to watch an episode of the PichuBros. and sit through other boring commentary to access other parts of the game. It's not a very fun experience, at least for people over 12. It's truly mindless. Even the more meaty segments of the game, like the quiz show, is way too easy -- I was able to answer nine of ten questions correctly with a very rudimentary knowledge of Pokemon.However, I do realize that this is a kids' title. From that perspective I think Pokemon Channel gets the job done, especially if the child is an avid fan or too young to grasp more complex games. There are some interesting aspects, like the paint program, but even the taking care of Pikachu bit is pretty simple. If parents are looking for a kid friendly title, this is it. However, teenager and adults (whether or not a Pokemon fan) will find far too mind numbing to tolerate. Please rent it first, if you're still curious.", "date": "Dec 5, 2003"}
