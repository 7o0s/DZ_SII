PC gamers have been waiting for a good boxing game since 4D Boxing was released in 1991.  OK, I admit that the game didn't look all that good and the characters were blocky, but jeez, that was a fun game.  Now, eight years later, I was expecting a simulation that incorporates the flash of Vegas with the intense heavy-hitting action of professional boxing.  Unfortunately, Data Becker's KO doesn't live up to this challenge and falls flat on it's face long before the final bell rings.  As much as the game stresses ~Ultra-Realistic Boxing~ (it's printed 7 times on the box), KO is just a watered-down simulation that offers little of the feel of real-life boxing.  For starters, if you're like me, you're never really excited about the pre-made pugilists and you'll want to create your own unique boxer to send through the ranks. You want to customize nearly every aspect of your boxer, from reach to weight, hair color to punching power.  KO is a big let-down in this department.  Sure, you can whip up a new fighter, but you can only adjust your champion's handedness, power, speed, and stamina.  There's no definable height, no definable weight -- not even a way to adjust your boxers reach.  Where's the simulation depth?  Where's the customizability?  Where's the so-called ultra-realism?  After you create your disappointing bruiser, you can test out your moves in the training arena.  This part of the game is actually pretty fun, and I got over my initial frustration with the boxer creation options once I heard my old, raspy-voiced coach scream out, ~Sock 'em in the head!~  He also wasn't afraid to point out that I was slower than his grandmother.  Awwww, bless her heart.  She must be doing pretty good for her age.    After learning the basic jabs, hooks, and body blows, it was off to the sparring ring to learn some more advanced moves against a computer opponent.  There's still nothing challenging here.  The computer AI is extremely watered down and you have little to worry about.  The sparring ring is where you really get ready for a fight, and you can set up a few custom combos to add a bit of flair to your arsenal.  Now your time as a scrub is over -- it's time for the main event.  Unfortunately, the main event blows harder than Tyson did after he bit off Holyfield's lower ear. Like most boxing games, you have a health bar and a stamina bar.  Get your opponent's health bar down to zero and he plants his bloody mug on the canvas.  The only problem is actually getting to that point. While everything seemed to move fairly well in the practice rounds, movement in the main event is sluggish and the controls are very unresponsive.  You'll have to hit the same key several times to get a punch off in some situations.  To make matters worse, if you run out of stamina, your boxer can't even throw a punch. Sure, I can understand that maybe your punches wouldn't do as much damage, but you should at least be able to take a quick, weak jab at your challenger to keep him on his toes.  It takes a long time for you to regain stamina, and your bars doesn't rise much even between rounds so, if you throw a lot of punches early in the fight, you're pretty much a sitting duck for the rest of the bout.  You might be thinking to yourself, ~Well, that's one of the strategies of boxing.  Wear your opponent out so he can't hit you anymore.~  Well, sure, but a professional boxer never becomes so tired he can't throw any punches after the first 30 seconds of a bout.  Expect that a lot in KO.  There are a lot of little quirks that are annoying about KO as well.  Again, I stress the ~Ultra-Realistic Boxing~ tag that's smeared all over the box.  So, if this simulation is supposed to be so realistic, why does the referee get beamed down into the ring  la Star Trek at the start of the match?  And why does he get beamed back up right after the match starts?  Where are the bright lights?  Where's the pomp?  Where's the smack-talking at the beginning?  Where's the crowd excitement?  This feels much more like a couple of drunk guys wailing on each other with sandbags tied to their hands than an ultra-realistic boxing sim.     Even multiplay is uninteresting and frustrating.  We couldn't even get the game to work over the LAN, so Steve and I just duked it out on the same computer with me at the keyboard and him on a gamepad.  He lasted about 3 rounds before he burst out laughing and headed back to his desk.  So, as you can tell, I'm not very impressed with Data Becker's foray into the boxing arena. KO is just plain boring, and that's the last thing a boxing game should be.  I'm just hoping that Prince Naseem Boxing turns out better.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Sep 21, 1999"}
