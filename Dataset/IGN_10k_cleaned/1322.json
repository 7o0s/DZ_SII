{"name": "Battlesport", "name_review": "Battlesport", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/07/02/battlesport", "text": "BattleSport has long been considered one of the most enjoyable titles available for the 3DO, so it is natural to assume the title might make it on other 32-bits systems.  The PlayStation version of the title is definitely more polished than its predecessor, with a higher frame rate and sharper graphics, but compared to newer titles it is graphically unimpressive.  While better than the 3DO version, the graphics in BattleSport are simply not up to par with current PlayStation titles. The sprite-based ball, for instance, is difficult to locate as it moves in and out of the distance, and the environments are sparse and rather bland.  The concept behind the game is much like a futuristic game of soccer.  Players can pick from several vehicles to control, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.  These vehicles can fire weapons at opponents, or simply speed around the arena in search of the ball.  Once collected, the ball must be shot into a goal that moves throughout the course.  The control of the vehicles takes a while to get used to as power sliding and jumping must be learned over time.  Learning to shoot both accurately and quickly takes a while as well, but is rewarding when learned.  One problem with the game is the odd physics that the ball follows.  Trying to anticipate how the ball will bounce off a wall or obstacle is extremely frustrating.  The motion of the ball, however, can be learned and eventually anticipated.   Once the game's quirks are learned, the fun of the title comes out.  Players can develop strategies and maneuvers much like any sports title.  The split-screen two player mode is particularly enjoyable thanks to the relatively simple environment which lets players focus on what's important, putting the ball in the goal.     However, when compared with other future-sport titles like LucasArts' BallBlazer Champions, BattleSport falls a little flat.", "date": "Jul 2, 1997"}
