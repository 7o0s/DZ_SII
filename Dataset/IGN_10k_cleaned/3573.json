Based on the idea that the player was a gung-ho American chopper pilot sent into the Middle East to stop a crazy dictator, the beautifully thought-out Genesis title was eventually spawned into a heap of follow-ups and sequels.   Unfortunately, its been a couple of ticks since the last installment came to a home console, and it looks as though the retirement bug may have gotten to EA's old war dog. Just as we began to notice however, the team at Kuju and Midway have put their heads together and recaptured the spirit of that stellar series, with Fireblade.   Story  Created by a coalition of Western nations, Fireblade is an elite anti-terrorist military force that's been sired to put an end to rogue militia groups around the planet. The most dangerous of all these groups, known as the ~United Eastern States~ has been discovered to house a myriad of hidden training camps and production facilities in a plot to assemble weapons of mass destruction. The outlook is grim.   But that is where you come in. Rallied by the Western alliance and as prepared as you'll ever be, Fireblade has been mobilized, and the time for battle has begun.   Okay so maybe the plotline doesn't win any points by way of originality but this a helicopter war game after all, so the bar isn't that monolithic. Unfortunately, for those of you out there waiting to see the plot unfold into something bigger, badder, and more epic than what's been hinted at, you won't. The campaign-like mission structure does very little in terms of story advancement, but because of Fireblade's nature as a military action game, it doesn't take away from the experience one bit.   Gameplay  Complicated perhaps for budding pilots, the control-heavy shooting layout may be overwhelming at first. Using both analog sticks for forward and side to side movement, the configurable steering model reminded us of an airborne version of Red Faction. Once you've got driving your twirly-gig down pat however, it's on to the face buttons which do everything from engage your turbo engines to activating your thermal imaging device. In fact, there isn't a key on the controller that isn't utilized in some way or another.   Learning curve aside, Fireblade is thoroughly playable and does a great job of mixing up its types of missions. Whether you're looking at a straightforward destruction objective or a ~defend the base~ challenge, you'll get plenty of chances to test your mettle. The most entertaining of which, have to be those that require you to hop into stealth mode and infiltrate enemy bases.   Using a noise meter (much like the PC FPS, Solider of Fortune II: Retro Helix does), the semi-invisible chopper has to slowly hover from point to point, while switching into sniper mode to take out guards on alert towers. Additionally, your shadow pilot is required to send an EMP blast to nearby vehicles to render them useless so as not to notify their buddies of your presence. Genuinely fun, and packed full of tension, these were the situations we found ourselves replaying over and over again.   Which is a particularly cool aspect of Fireblade's mission structure. As once you've defeated a particular challenge within the game's four campaigns, you can go back and play it again in an attempt to better your previous performance. A nice and easy way of increasing the title's return value, it was a decision that we greatly appreciated.   What's appreciated most however, is that there is refreshingly little to complain about in regards to Fireblade's gameplay. While it could have used more missions in addition to the ones provided and perhaps an easier to use radar screen, the complaint list is next to invisible. And let us not forget to mention the above-average difficulty level found in the latter stages. A bonus in the days of watered-down casual-friendly entries, Kuju's move to the land of experts should be applauded.     Graphics  A big improvement over the earlier preview versions we had been collecting in the months leading up to its release, Fireblade's visuals are pretty good. With the special effects especially taking center stage. Explosions, tracers, and realistic weather effects are but a few of the neat touches that accentuate the busy onscreen action. And on a more personal level, it was most assuredly a pleasure to discover that the slowdown we experienced in our alpha copies had been almost completely eradicated.   The chopper models, tanks, and other vehicles too are large and cleverly built, with a smattering of moving parts to perpetuate the illusion. Including a couple of entries we swear were taken directly out of Rambo III.   If anything, the only gripe we had is the obvious choice to go with low-res textures. Probably needed to keep the framerate from dipping into the core of mother earth, the sparsely detail skins in the environments and models have a fuzzy, unclean look about them. On that merit, Fireblade appears to be just a slight step above the older Electronic Arts Strike games that we mentioned earlier.   Sound  Fireblade could have been much stronger in this department, with a wide array of missile sounds, gun blasts, and other such audio. But what we get instead is the basic sound bank of ~Boom~, ~Blam~, and ~Ratta-Tatta-Tat~. It's by no means a poor collection of ear stimulation; it's just that we've heard most of these blips before. In a strange kind of way, it's as though the audio is repetitive before you even hear it.   There is however a decent amount of voice thrown in to brief you before and during your missions, although some of it is pretty goofy. Taking itself too seriously perhaps, the grizzled, war colonel overtones are simultaneously helpful and corny. Definitely worth a laugh or two.  Though Fireblade isn't going to win any awards with its so-so visuals and paper-thin plotline, the effort that Kuju and Midway have shown with the finished product is a nice one. A little too short for wartime veterans, and possibly too complicated for Joe Average, this arcade war-simulation probably won't attract a huge audience.But for those of us out there that appreciate what goes into making a game good, and don't mind reading an instruction booklet to figure out how to play, you could do a lot worse.
