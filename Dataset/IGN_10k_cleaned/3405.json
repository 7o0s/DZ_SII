The console and handheld versions of the game are as different as night and day, but they both have their issues that keep them from being quality movie conversions. On the GBA, Minority Report: Everybody Runs has poor implementation of control as well as sluggish animation that hurt an otherwise great design idea. Features 10 levels Six different weapons Cartridge save Only for Game Boy Advance  The game opens up with John Anderton on the job, out to stop a crime before it even happens...hence the term ~pre-crime.~ In the first few levels, players, as Anderton, blast their way through the areas before the bad guys can whittle away the officer's health, searching out the man that's convicted of the pre-crime. As the story unfolds, and much like the movie, John Anderton himself is the next man who's convicted of a pre-crime...and the rest of the game is designed around him making a break for it so he can clear his name. All of the action revolves around the game's side-scrolling engine, running around and blasting enemies with ~harmless~ weapons like the gel pistol, gel burst gun, concussion gun, grenade launcher, and ionic blaster.  And that's really the big issue with Minority Report: its implementation of the lock-on gameplay isn't quite seamless, and in many places it's just way too clunky. Much of the game's challenge is to cycle the crosshair between the innocents and the enemies, making sure that the trigger isn't pulled when the target's sitting on a bystander. It's frustrating when it happens, simply because the target sometimes (and what seems to be randomly) cycles to an innocent when an actual enemy is right in front of him. It's a little unfair to do that, and it makes the game less twitch-oriented since players have to force themselves to pause for a split-second, making sure that the targeting system zeroes in on a proper enemy.  The other problem is that Anderton's sprite turns around a little too sluggishly, which makes it somewhat difficult to target enemies behind them; the animation has to cycle through its few frames when a player wants to face in the opposite direction. So an enemy can get an unfair advantage by blasting John from behind, and by the time it takes the character sprite to turn around to face the threat, the enemy's already got off three or four damaging hits.  But even with these annoying elements, the game isn't bad at all. In fact, it's challenging and fun once players learn how to adopt these clumsy control elements into their gameplay. Some ideas, like the ability to hide behind trashcans and target on-screen enemies from the safety of cover really adds a cool, strategic element to an otherwise action-heavy game design. The graphic engine is worth noting, with its huge, rendered sprites and well-produced backgrounds; strangely, though, the game has some really odd loading pauses moving from one part of the level to the next, which is extremely unusual for the Game Boy Advance system. It's most likely pulling the ~enemy killed~ data from storage as it moves from one area to the next, but it's still very awkward to see load times on a cartridge-based videogame. I can definitely see how people could hate this game; it's emphasis on its unique ~lock on~ gameplay design causes some serious problems when the action gets intense, since it's easy to hit an innocent bystander when trying to quickly cycle through the on-screen targets. The pacing of the Anderton sprite could have been handled a bit better, giving him faster animations especially during the transition of facing the opposite direction. The game would have been a much better design had these issues been addressed, but even with them in there it's still not a terrible action title. Minority Report: Everybody Runs just needed another month or so in its development cycle to balance out the quirks.", "date": "Jan 29, 2003"}
