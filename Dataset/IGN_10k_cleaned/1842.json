Mattel's latest gem is an action/puzzle title based around its miniature R/C cars on the market -- Racin' Ratz..  This game may be for the kids, but there's a lot for the older crowd to like here. Features Ten levels Two characters to choose Password save  Only for Game Boy Color  The game's story goes a little something like this  you're a kid (either a boy or girl, very P.C.) who's just been sent to his/her room for smashing a precious flower vase with a Racin' Ratz car. Now you're all trapped in your room with nothing to do  but hey, thanks to the miracle of Radio Control, you can still cause a bit of mayhem in the house. And that's the nature of the game  to see what you can do with your Racin' Ratz car in the house's ten rooms.  The game's structure is laid out similarly to a title such as Chip's Challenge -- you're given a specific task to accomplish, such as grab a wallet from dad's room or grandma's dentures off of her night stand, and you'll need to scope out the room's layout to figure out just how to go about and pull it off.  Now, while you've got full control over your vehicle in an overhead perspective, you have to use power-ups and the room's elements to get the jobs done. For example, in one level, the item in question is high up on a table, and the only way to get it is to climb the wall with a Wall Climb power-up. Problem is, the only Wall Climb power-up is up on another table, which can only be accessed by driving up a tiny ruler...which can only be done by shrinking your vehicle. And that Shrink power-up is up on another ledge that has to be leapt up on by a springboard. Got it? The game has several puzzles in the house's ten locations, and your progress is saved through the use of a tiny password system.  The game is a real challenge and a lot of fun to play, but the design would have been a lot more intense and energetic if the developers added one more feature: a time clock. Without anything to move you along in the levels, you have all the time in the world to get the task done. If the designers put in a set time to finish the tasks, there'd be a huge sense of urgency, as well as another element to fight against. As it is, the game does a nice job of taxing the brain, but it'd be nice to get a small rush when beating the clock.  The graphics are the game's only downside, as the in-game graphics are really ugly  it's tough to tell height with the perspective the artists drew objects, and some items just don't look like anything at all. But the nasty background graphics are off-set with good character design and a nifty front-end interface. It's a shame that guys beyond their mid-teens will pass this game by simply because of the license used  Racin' Ratz is a well-designed puzzle game with a lot of challenge and fun. It could have been a lot more intense with a couple of elements in place, but as it is the team did a nice job with the product they had to work with.", "date": "Mar 15, 2001"}
