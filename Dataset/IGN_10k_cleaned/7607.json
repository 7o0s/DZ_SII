The Genesis featured knockout graphics for its time and, more importantly, exciting and innovative games. From engrossing RPGs to fast-paced action titles to addictive puzzle games, the Genesis had it all. With the glut of cookie-cutter titles on current-gen systems, it's nice to be able to go back to a time when games were fresh and exciting and the potential for virtual adventure seemed limitless. Sega Genesis Collection is exactly what a nostalgic gamer needs for a worthwhile trip down memory lane.  Featuring 27 Sega-published Genesis games and five unlockable Sega arcade games, the SGC is one of the most robust collections I've seen. Considering it retails for just $19.99, this is the best deal you'll find in any store this year. Where most collections have 30% great games and 70% crap you'd never play, the Sega Genesis Collection is more of an 80/20 split between good and bad.

This is an incredible gathering of Genesis greats that will please those who loved these games as a kid, but also introduces newer gamers to some of gaming's true classics.  Some games do show their age. Altered Beast is a terrible game and it's hard to imagine this was once a coveted Sega title. But there are other gems which had gone long forgotten. Comix Zone, which has a slick living-in-a-comic-book style to it, seems just as inventive as when it was first released.  Without doubt, the prize of the collection are the three Phantasy Star RPGs. Phantasy Star IV is one of the best RPGs of all time, hands down, no arguments. As with all of the Genesis Collection titles, Phantasy Star IV is perfectly recreated with retouched graphics to make the transition to large-screen TVs not the least bit jarring. This is the best Genesis games have ever looked. Even on an LCD or Plasma screen the titles look sharp. Sure, they are still 16-bit graphics, but without proper care, they could be a pixelated mess.  It's not all perfection. A few of the choices and omissions are curious. I'd gladly trade Ecco Jr., Decap Attack or Virtua Fighter 2 (Genesis, not arcade version) for the Streets of Rage trilogy or Eternal Champions. That said, Sega Genesis Collection gathers some games that haven't been available since the 16-bit system. Even more exciting is the addition of five Sega arcade games, each easily unlocked. Zaxxon is available for the first time in North America. That in itself may be reason enough to drop $20 on SGC.  Step into the Comix Zone Backbone Entertainment has even fixed some problems of the past. In previous collections with Sonic 2, playing split-screen with another player would create some minor screen tearing. These and similar issues have been fixed. Gamers also have the ability to save any time in any of the games. There are also ~museum~ features on most games, detailing the history and even cheats and tips. It's not all roses and sunshine for the Sega Genesis Collection. The presentation is lacking. This is a budget title and it has received a very sparse packaging for its menus. Instead of an inventive interface that is reminiscent of the Genesis, gamers get a bland and uninspired entry system into the 16-bit world. The ten interviews included seem hastily put together and there are some oddly long load times between some menus. Sega Genesis Collection is easily the best assemblage of Sega games you can find on PS2. Though the presentation isn't quite as strong as I'd like, the sheer number of quality games makes any missteps forgivable. The graphics, while 16-bit, are as crisp and attractive as possible. If you are a fan of the Genesis, this is one collection that can't be missed. There's no doubt that at least 10 of the 32 games included will suck away a few dozen hours of your time. At $20, this a bargain almost impossible to pass up.", "date": "Nov 16, 2006"}
