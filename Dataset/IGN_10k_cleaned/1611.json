Those moldy old arcade games from the early '80s have been popping up on budget compilations from Namco and Williams. Most are good, but some, like Namco's Volume 2, suffer from too many no-name games. Williams' Atari Years 1 compilation is, however, just the opposite.  Atari is widely held as the company that made the early arcade days (read: late '70s) great, what with such stellar games as Missile Command, Battlezone, and Tempest commanding attention. After its acquisition of Atari Games this year, Williams has wisely decided to re-release these, as well as Asteroids, Centipede, and Super Breakout, on one disc. For those of us old enough to remember those games, this is one great package.  Gamers weaned on polygons and 8-button controllers may balk at the primitive vector graphics and limited one-screen gameplay, and for them we say spend your money elsewhere. But for anyone interested in the history of games, you need look no further. There's even a narrated history section, complete with photos and interviews with the people who programmed the original games  It'd make a great Christmas present for dad, too.", "date": "Sep 4, 1997"}
