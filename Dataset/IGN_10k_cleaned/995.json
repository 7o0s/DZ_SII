Taking the form of a computer-generated avatar, players are presented with the opportunity to surf the ~hallways~ of different systems in the hopes of accomplishing one of three separate goals.  Not a bad idea to start, but dated graphics and downright stone-aged sounds leave the indelible mark of mediocrity in the place of what could have been a fantastic game.  Cranking things up, the very first thing that any new owner of AI Wars needs to do is go to the game's website and download the newest patch (1.05 at the time of this writing).  This patch fixes some known bugs and also includes a tutorial that can be run from inside the game interface.  The tutorial is invaluable since the paltry instructions do little to assist young hackers on the road to success.  Gamers then need to choose what type of game they'd like to play.  This is done by selecting one of three end goals that include achieving sentience, controlling the Net, and gaining immortality.  Any and all of these options can be selected, allowing for either a relatively simple goal, or a more complex one.  To be honest, mastering just one of these seemed hard enough, but the truly gifted may want to shoot for all three.  Moving into the interface, gamers will learn that they are playing as someone who is doing precisely what they are doing at the time...sitting in a chair.  You are a hacker who controls an avatar of yourself inside the vast world of the Internet.  Depending on your choice of the goals mentioned above, the avatar will have different tasks to complete.  If you'd like to control the Net, you'll have to plant a backdoor virus in each of the core systems of the game.  Achieving sentience for your avatar, or immortality for yourself, will involve a slightly different tactic though.  Instead of just gaining control of everything in sight, specific technologies will have to be sought out, researched, and ultimately combined.  Using the three dimensional, 1st or 3rd person perspective (your choice), your hero will need to collect blocks of data lying around different systems, and then use that information to further your individual cause.  To assist you in this task, a handy set of software tools is at your disposal.  Weaponry software such as the virus and IRC launchers can be used against sentinel programs that try to impede your progress.  Crack software can be used to find the password of locked systems and Masquerade programs can assist you in not being detected when performing such a crack.  All of these software packages, though they come equipped at the beginning, must be upgraded over time in order to remain useful.  Otherwise, an overly powerful Warden or sentinel program may just shrug off your offenses, and plant your avatar in the recycle bin.  If this sounds at all confusing, that's because it is.  Even with the informative tutorial, it's still incredibly difficult to get the hang of things in this title.  The game begins with your character in a central hub of sorts, with eight numbered doors from which to choose.  Entering each door loads a different system for you to explore, though the individual goal for each area remains a mystery.  The lack of a mapping utility of any kind also tends to slow things down, since many of the rooms and corridors tend to look very similar.  It's distressing to be trying to explore every nook and cranny of a level, only to realize that you've already explored the particular cranny you're been hanging out in for the past half hour.  Once committing to an area, and learning the way around a little, things can still become more than frustrating when faced with an enemy program (which look just like little robots...go figure).    The enemy utilities are armed with the same type of software as you are packing.  They are fond of opening up with a blast from the IRC, which temporarily freezes your character.  This is then followed by a barrage of virus bursts, which not only damage you on impact, but also continue to weaken you until you eventually die.  The only way to counteract this effect is to upgrade your anti-virus package, but good luck finding one of those when you need it.  This is no first-person shooter boys and girls, it's more of a strategy game.  So the bottom line is, if you get tagged, you are going to start to slowly die, and that's pretty much the size of it.  Accept it, and move on.  While the gameplay certainly serves up enough confusion, even more is distributed when it comes to visuals and sounds.  Okay, I understand that this company is small and of a limited budget, but it still feels like a lot more could have been done with both of these categories.  The graphics, despite the use of a 3D accelerator, are reminiscent of something that could have been released a decade ago.  The corridors and creatures are very sparsely detailed, and few frames of animation seem to accompany anything that attempts to move.  For the ears there are some fairly nice music tracks presented in MP3 format, but the sound effects are just atrocious.  These seem like they could have been recorded from a keychain noisemaker, and do not belong in the retail release of a computer game in the 21st century.  Essentially, as you've probably determined on your own by now, this is yet another example of a game employing a decent plotline with poor execution.  For those gamers out there who have a lot of patience to learn how to play the game in the first place, you may be able to tolerate it.  However, even those individuals may be turned off by the less than impressive visuals and sound effects.  So unless you believe you can deal with these flaws, even those who are attracted by the type of game this is should consider looking down other avenues.  -- Rich Rouse", "date": "Jun 8, 2000"}
