Psygnosis has gone the long way round   with City Of Lost Children, and actually   made the game resemble the movie.    Loosely based on the decidedly surreal   French film of the same name, City Of Lost   Children is an eerie adventure in the same   vein as Alone In The Dark. However, while the film had a certain wackiness to it that complemented its visual style, the game gets bogged down with vague missions and a slow pace.  You control Miette, a young girl living in an evil orphanage. You are ordered to complete two introductory missions for them, namely stealing, and then you are thrust into the main focus of the game: find the lost children. The gap between the first two missions and the main one is huge, and seems illogical.  In fact, much of the game seems illogical. It is never quite clear what you're supposed to do next, and you'll find yourself stuck with no clue more often than not. Even if you have seen the movie (which helps a lot) you may find yourself bewildered and confused.  The movie was superb, but unfortunately the game suffers from being too vague. The graphics and environments are quite good, but they don't help when you're totally lost.", "date": "May 23, 1997"}
