{"name": "Tekken 2", "name_review": "Tekken 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/27/tekken-2", "text": "The original Tekken, one of the first games to be released for the PlayStation, set a new standard for 3D fighters. Many games have since surpassed it, but there's no denying the original impact Tekken had on the gaming world.  Now here comes Tekken 2, ready to set the gaming world alight again. Numerous improvements have been made over the original, most noticeably in graphics, but the gameplay remains as sturdy as ever. The backgrounds are definitely more involved this time around, replacing the barren Virtua Fighter I-style backdrops with detailed, and occasionally moving, fighting arenas. And the light sourcing! It has to be seen to be believed.  The animation of the characters has been smoothed out considerably, although the fighters are still a little blocky when compared to some other games. This is hardly a sin though, when you consider the amount of extras Namco has thrown in. Not only are theremore than 20 playable characters (sub-bosses become playable one at a time, over time, or when beat), the game adds Tournament modes, Survival modes, and an essential Practice mode. A practice mode seems so obvious, it's surprising it's not a regular feature in fighters.  No one's saying Tekken 2 is perfect, although it sure comes close. As it stands, it's one of the best fighters available for the PlayStation.", "date": "Nov 27, 1996"}
