Take a regular and potentially boring racing model and spice it up with ramps, corkscrews, loops, gaps, volcanoes, you name it. Who needs to race 500 laps in a circle, eh? Boring! As PC gaming has gradually expanded to the point where it can support all kinds of niche games, we've seen a lot of these stunt track games in the last few years, the most recent of which is TrackMania. In addition to just racing on crazy tracks, though, you also get to build your own. While this sounds cool on paper, though, there are a few caveats.  While the tracks themselves have an endearingly miniaturized Hot Wheels feel to them, with narrow roads, super-responsive vehicle handling, and overlapping routes, you figure out pretty quickly that the actual racing part of the game is not the main focus. First of all, there's no vehicular collision detection. Your car will bump into walls and flip and such, but you'll go right through the other cars. And since the AI isn't very difficult, it's just a basic time challenge against multiple underwhelming opponents.  Second, there's no emergency brake, virtually eliminating the very handy power slides found in other games. Instead, the vehicle grips the turn with almost cartoonish aggressiveness. Last, it's pretty easy in the later stages to hit a difficult spot that totally kills the race for you. Miss a ramp by a little bit or fall through a hole in the road, and you're basically toast. Either that, or you get lucky and sail through to third, second, or first place, based on a generous, predetermined best time for each track. There isn't much middle ground.  And there's also no damage modeling, either of the simulation or cosmetic kind. Sometimes a door or hood would look a little loose, but that's about it. Although it becomes apparent that designing a track is the heart of this game, the race model has been overshadowed even by current middle-of-the-road titles.  The puzzle mode offers a fresh idea where, before the race starts, you get a few pieces to work with in a track editor mode and have to figure out where they go to complete the track. Sometimes it's a bunch of pieces, and you have to basically build the track from scratch. Other times, it's just a couple key ramps. However, there were also some ~puzzle~ races that didn't give me any extra pieces, and I couldn't move or erase track pieces that were already there, making it just another basic time challenge.  There's also the survival mode, also known as knockout, where the last person to finish doesn't advance to the next stage. If you decide to give up at any time, you forfeit the series. The tracks are randomly selected from three different types and become progressively more difficult, with challenging turns, obstacles, and jumps that are mostly of that make-or-break kind I mentioned above. There's also three types of race within this, where you'll be racing either an SUV, a muscle car, or a rally hatchback, and environments include winter, desert, and countryside. So there's plenty of variety, and you also get to choose from a bunch of different designs for each type of car. However, the variety helps only so much when you run into the fundamental issues of the racing model.    So eventually, you'll decide to try out the editor. You'll get to choose from the three different climates, each with a different budget. Then you'll build everything from scratch, choosing parts and linking them together, testing them, and whatnot. While you can build and test some potentially very cool tracks, the interface really needs some work. First of all, you can't navigate the map with the mouse. Instead, you have to use the arrow keys, going only in four directions. Elevation of the cursor is controlled by the Page Up and Page Down keys.  It really would have been great to be able to elevate and descend with the scroll wheel, and rotate the camera around with the mouse. Instead, you rotate 90 degrees at a time, and it's often awkward trying to figure out exactly how things are going to line up. And since you can't pull the camera back very far, it's pretty difficult to get an overall perspective of the creation.  Unfortunately, the awkwardness doesn't end there. If you want to test the track, you have to leave editor mode, start the race, sit through the intro (which consists of the same guitar lick and cinematic camera zoom every time), find where the track doesn't work, leave race mode, then you're back. Since the camera can't pull back very far, you'll be going through this process a lot, depending on how complicated the track is. That same guitar lick and rushing camera zoom before each test gets a little annoying when all you want to do is jump in and go. If you test the track from within editor mode, you'll get dropped down wherever the active building area is, in the orientation the camera is facing. This is great if you want to check out just one part of the track, but I would have preferred simply clicking on a part of the track and starting there, facing in the correct direction.To its credit, the game looks pretty good, with appreciable view distance, reasonably complex objects, good texturing, and widely varied, colorful track types. The problem with TrackMania is that it's not fun to play so much as being fun to play around with--a temporary diversion in until the next installment of Project Gotham Racing, Need for Speed Underground, or whatever your particular racing jones really is. With a dated racing model and keyboard-driven track editor, it just cant compete with the big boys, although young gamers might get a kick out of it. If you want to check it out for free, FilePlanet has a multiplayer demo, which also comes with the editor.", "date": "Jul 2, 2004"}
