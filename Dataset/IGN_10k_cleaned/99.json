With a starting line-up of Sonic, Tails, Doctor Eggman, the spunky Ulala, NiGHTS, Beat from Jet Set Radio, Amigo from Samba de Amigo, and the cheeky Aiai from Super Monkey Ball, Sega Superstars Tennis should be leaping the net with the sweaty sheen of victory.   However, whilst Mario Tennis supports its star-studded line-up with good physics, precise controls and inventive mini-game distractions, Sega Superstars Tennis can only manage a simplistic two-button control scheme and a half-baked buffet of mini-game challenges that offer none of the depth that you can already find in Sega's own Virtua Tennis. Hmmm.   Unlike the solid single-player distractions of Virtua Tennis' World Tour career mode, or even the RPG mechanics in Mario Tennis on GBA, Sega Superstars Tennis is a much more basic ball-whacking offering. There's straight up Match play for singles or doubles, and a no-frills Tournament mode that strings together five opponents with a perfunctory trophy animation at the end of it all - and little in the way of story cut-scenes or any kind of dramatic build-up to make it all feel worthwhile. When you trot through your first tournament in a fleeting 20 minutes and the credits start to roll, you'll wonder if you missed something.     That's because it's the Planet Superstars mode that will most likely chew up the most of your game time. Here you can select from themed challenges, each based on a popular Sega game. There's Jet Set Radio, After Burner, Golden Axe, NiGHTS, Out Run, Space Channel 5, Super Monkey Ball and so on, with many of the ~missions~ based on content from those games. Successfully completing these varied missions drip-feeds you with new stages and new characters, so there's some encouragement to keep playing.   While many of the mini-games do require some dexterity, there's none of the originality, humour or testing gameplay that you might expect from the developers of Virtua Tennis. Superstars Tennis may be aimed at a younger audience, but even so, what's on offer is underwhelming.    The Curien Mansion (an oddly re-named House of the Dead) stage, for instance, revolves around knocking down approaching zombies with well-aimed shots. Hit a ball hard enough and it can pass through several zombies at once, earning you a combo bonus. To up the difficulty, some zombies will throw tennis rackets at you as if they were machetes, killing your character instantly if you're struck. Occasionally, cute power-ups pop out, giving you triple-shot tennis balls or a big ball that will knock zombies down like bowling pins.    It's tennis, Jim, but not as we know it.  Whilst all this sounds like tremendous amounts of fun, it's not as exciting as you may think. Each challenge tends to be a minor variation of the last, from having to knock down a certain number of zombies, to having to reach a certain number of points which involves, yes, knocking down zombies. And so on. The appeal rinses clean before you've even got your hands wet.   Most of the stages, at least, look exactly like the games they're based on. The Jet Set Radio stage is set in a perfectly realised Shibuya bus station, plucked straight from the Dreamcast original. The Super Monkey Ball stage too, is an imaginative twirl of platforms that could easily be a level from the brilliant puzzler, albeit with a tennis court plonked in the middle.    Some of the mini-game missions even show some creativity, such as the Puyo Pop Fever theme that requires you to clear falling puyos at the other end of the court before they stack up too high; and in Jet Set Radio, you must tag graffiti by picking up the correct colour spray cans before trying to plant the ball inside the outline sketched on the court.     Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good. The mini-games are, overall, too easy, too dull or too short. And it's unforgiveable that the Golden Axe stage you unlock isn't even based on Golden Axe - it simply throws you back to the zombie-laden Curien Mansion court. Is this a mistake or just pure laziness? Either way, it's sloppy.   Of course, whilst mini-games are a fine enough distraction, most of us buy a tennis game hoping for intense rallies and spirited multiplayer face-offs. Sadly, Sega Superstars Tennis falls short even when it comes to basic tennis mechanics.   Instead of building upon the polish and finesse already achieved by Virtua Tennis, Sumo Digital has opted for a baffling two-button control scheme. The X button is a ~fast shot~ (top spin, basically) and the Square button is a weaker ~slow shot~. To perform a lob, you need to quickly tap X and then Square; and to send over a drop shot, you quickly tap Square and then X. For some reason, known only to the boffins at Sumo Digital, the Triangle and Circle buttons have been totally left out of the equation. Why the lob couldn't have been on Triangle and the drop shot couldn't have been on Circle, we have no idea. This needlessly fiddly control scheme was obviously a necessity in Mario Tennis on the two-button GBA, but it's ridiculously out of place here on the PS3. With the timing of your button presses all-important, needing to tap two buttons is maddening. To make matters worse, there's no way to manually slice the ball.   Uh... Hmm.   More frustration lies in each character's special attack. After winning a few points in a row, a star symbol under your player's feet will start to sparkle, indicating that you can perform a special shot. These moves vary from character to character, but the common effect is for the tennis ball (complete with glowing trail) to zigzag or spiral all over the court before landing in front of your opponent. But not only is it confusing for your opponent, it's also confusing for the player performing the move, because it can be very difficult to tell where the return shot will come from. What's worse is that triggering the special move cuts the camera away from the court to a pre-jigged animation of your character conjuring up their power for the shot. When the camera switches back to the match, you have a fraction of a second to remember where the ball was headed. Choose to trigger your power-up as the ball is coming towards you and you can be guaranteed to lose the point, such is the distraction of the cut-away animation.   One saving grace with special moves is that they also place obstacles in your opponent's path, from Aiai's slippery bananas, to Dr. Eggman's floating orbs of electricity. If you're lucky, this will be enough to screw up their shot.   Sadly, this is probably the best use of the Sonic license in last few years.  Rallying with a friend has limited appeal, as do online multiplayer matches, because there just isn't enough depth to the controls, nor the precise player movement, to turn out exciting bouts of tennis. Sega Superstars Tennis may have enough in it to satisfy younger gamers who aren't yet familiar with Virtua Tennis, Top Spin or Mario Tennis, but the rest of us will find it hollow and short-lived.  Sega Superstars Tennis just screams missed opportunity. With a strong selection of classic Sega games to draw inspiration from and such a charming cast of characters on hand, it's depressing to find the core mechanics so shallow and the overall game design so slap-dash.", "date": "Mar 28, 2008"}
