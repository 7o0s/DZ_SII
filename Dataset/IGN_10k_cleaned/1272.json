We actually kind of liked Professional Bull Rider.  It was simple and devoid of depth, but it was good for a few laughs and it was a refreshing addition to a PC market full of monotonous clone after clone.  Unfortunately, it looks like PBR2 turned out to be just a bunch of bull.  Like the original, there's just not much here.  The game is actually built on the exact same engine, only with one new gameplay mode.  In addition to bull riding, the team has added bullfighting into the fray.  In the bull riding event, you'll have to lean, twist, account for changes in direction, grip hard onto a smelly hide, dig in spurs and pray to any deity who'll listen that you won't be thrown to the ground or gouged by the closest cousin redneck America's got to a charging rhino.  Bullfighters have it even better, as they stand on open ground in an arena waiting for the beast to charge right for 'em.  While the name of the game is bullfighting, your objective is to jump over the bull while he comes right at you, horns aimed for your...well, right for you.   The safest, most entertaining bet is to play the bull, crippling Dwight Yoakam look-alikes as punishment for their crimes of fashion.  However, what was mildly entertaining last year just seems dated and boring this year.  Repeated taps on the keyboard or joypad will appear to be of no avail to the untrained eye.  Experienced riders know that in reality a precisely timed lunge, re-grip or jab in the ass (to the bull's buttocks that is, there's no donkey riding events in PBR2) with a sharp object increases your chances of surviving the encounter in one piece, coincidentally allowing one to remain perched on the bull's back as well.  Again, similar combinations of taps give an animal an array of moves with which to buck its rider.  Additionally, bullfighters have been provided with some nifty button based acrobatic tricks, though they've still got a snowball's chance in hell of waltzing out of the arena without a gaping puncture wound in their rear end.  But it's nigh impossible to get the timing down right, as the controls are sticky and unresponsive and the lone performance indicators are sporadic blurbs of advice from the announcer and the fact that you're not lying flat on the ground as a bloody, trampled heap.  Or, in the bull's case, that the cowboy just went flying off into the wild blue younder to land somewhere in Section G, about twenty rows back.  Bundled with the insipid play comes a bunch of uninspired play modes (single session, career, two players on one computer multiplayer, etc.) that could just as easily have come from a generic arcade racer.  Although the presentation's too country western to sit well with the average Joe, Pro Bull Rider 2's visuals are outstanding.  Stunning, delicately painted texture maps cover pseudo realistic polygonal cowboys and bulls that know how to strut their stuff.  Menus also sport the same polished look, incorporating icons and indicators into the design.  Generic yet resoundingly painful yelps and grunts echo from the speakers, though you can tone them out when watching the included movie trailer for Ring of Fire by listening to Lynyrd Skynyrd's ~Dance with the Devil.~  Frankly speaking, it's infinitely more entertaining to view the backwater town follies as a spectator than it is to participate in them.  Regardless, there's no sense in ponying up Sierra's asking price for this kind of televised spectacle when it can be had for the cost of a movie rental... anyone for When Animals Attack?  Assuming that publishers' intentions are to bludgeon the freaky, off-kilter sports market into submission, they've succeeded admirably.  Professional Bull Rider 2 misses the essential elements that made the original at least palatable.  In lieu of reveling in its own mediocrity, this title combines superb visual/programming resources with a sluggish gameplay system that's only entertaining for a few minutes.  Country boys may love it, but everyone else'll be found proclaiming their opinions in the outhouse.  -- Scott Steinberg", "date": "Sep 22, 2000"}
