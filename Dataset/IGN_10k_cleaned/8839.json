The people  those who remain  fear for their lives and look for a hero, someone to step forward and lead. Someone to command the Shining Force. A strategy RPG first seen on the Genesis, Shining Force casts you as that savior, tasking you to master a turn-based, grid-battle combat system to save the kingdom of Guardiana. It's a quest you should accept. Shining Force is one of the earliest, but one of the best, strategy RPG designs to ever come to the United States  and its slick presentation, addicting tactical gameplay and lengthy adventure make it an excellent value on the Virtual Console.   It's all about the squares. Shining Force's battle system checkerboards each environment into a set of squares, and each engagement plays out across these grids  Nintendo-loyal gamers would find it most similar to the setup of Fire Emblem or Advance Wars. And, strengthening that comparison, units that attack each other on the grid trigger a cut-away animation sequence that renders the fighters in more detail. That gives you a chance to get a better look at both your foes and allies, of which there are many.   Thirty in all, by the end of the quest. Though initially your Force is comprised of only six  an archer, a mage, a healer, a shrimpy warrior who looks like a hobbit and a centaur knight. More characters enlist further along in the adventure, as you, as the Force's leader, explore Guardiana and its neighboring lands.   A unique but familiar menu system frames both the combat sequences and the in-town exploration  talking, examining your surroundings, using items and more are handled with a diamond-shaped set of animated boxes that appear when you press the A Button. The familiarity will be most pronounced in Nintendo players who've experienced Golden Sun, or the Mario Sports Game Boy games, because Shining Force was also developed by Camelot Software Planning. The little touches like a head-nodding yes and head-nodding no to select your response when non-player characters ask you a question are fun to see here, in their first ever use.   Unfortunately, Camelot didn't have every aspect of in-game presentation perfected back in 1993, and there are also a few notable annoyances in how some things are handled. Acquiring items, for example, is tedious  opened treasure chests will relinquish their contents only to the party leader, and the party leader only has four inventory spots to fill. That means a lot of menu navigation and item juggling as your pass herbs, potions and extra weapons from character to character every time you happen to come across a hidden cache of collectibles.   The time it takes to progress through Shining Force is probably its proudest asset, as experiences lasting multiple hours are still rare to find on sale in the Wii Shop. The clock ticks itself away partly because of the storyline contained in the game, and the conversations it takes to advance it  but mostly because the battles here are actually engaging and strategic to play. You could maybe find success with a kick-in-the-door, guns-blazing strategy of running headfirst into the enemy and hacking away, but that's not too likely. The foes of Shining Force are not that forgiving, and almost always outnumber your men  so it's much more prudent and rewarding to take your time, evaluate the surrounding terrain, and try to set up your warriors in formations that take advantage of, say, your archer's longer range, or your centaur's stoic defense.  Master the tactics of commanding the Force, and you'll surely be able to avenge the king's death  and have fun doing it. Shining Force is a great, classic Genesis title that fits perfectly into the lineup of available Virtual Console selections, especially since there are, so far, no other strategy RPGs to compete against it. It's well worth its 800 Wii Point asking price, and should most readily appeal to old-school Genesis owners, fans of Camelot's subsequent work on Nintendo systems, and strategy gamers in general.", "date": "Jul 31, 2007"}
