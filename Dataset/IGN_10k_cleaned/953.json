The game puts a single allied plane during World War II up against a near endless wave of  Japanese forces -- and it was designed by a Japanese game company. Well, at least I found that tidbit somewhat humorous.  Anyway, 1942 hit the arcade scene back in 1984. The Game Boy Color game is a port of the Nintendo Entertainment System game released a few years later. It was released when shooters were the big deal -- the ultimate twitch game where you maneuver your sprite through swarms of hazardous sprites, shooting them down with your guns. It's a formula, sure, but at the time, 1942 was one of the better shooters on the market. Today, though, the game may still have the appeal of a classic and provide a couple hours of enjoyment, but the design is so sterile and lacking compared to other members of the genre.  Features 32 levels Two player alternating Password save with printer support For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  You obviously don't need a novel to explain the gameplay elements of 1942 -- simply stay alive by shooting swarms of enemy planes looping around the playing field. The game takes place in an overhead perspective where you fly over the Pacific and Japanese islands (but don't interact with them). The screen continuously scrolls vertically, and the level ends when you reach your aircraft carrier. Within the levels you can acquire power-ups that will give you more bullets per shot, two escort planes that link up on either side of your plane (also providing additional firepower), or completely wipe out the on-screen aircraft in a single blast. You also have at your disposal a limited amount of barrel rolls -- this is a last-ditch maneuver. Find yourself being surrounded, hit the roll button and you'll be invincible for a second as your plane loops out of the way -- you can't shoot or move up or down during a roll, only sidestep to find a safer place on-screen.  The Game Boy Color game is as much a direct port of the NES version as possible on the portable. This means the sprites and backgrounds aren't quite as nice as they were in the arcade, nor does the game offer as much screen space as the vertical monitor configuration of the original. But as a dual-version game (meaning black-and-white compatibility), 1942 does look decent on the color screen -- there are a few places where the bullets get lost on the beach backgrounds, and when one too many planes get on screen the sprites begin to flicker. But even so the game looks really nice.  The problem here is just how short the enjoyment lasts.  1942 on the Game Boy Color still has 32 levels of action. Don't think this is a big number -- I completed the game on hard in two hours from start to finish. Thanks to the password scheme and unlimited continues, 1942 is a quick action fix. And the game just isn't that difficult, even when you switch the game to HARD. The game does play dirty pool by sending big ships behind you -- if they show up while you're at the bottom of the screen, you die. And the worst part is, there's really no variety in the gameplay -- every level, with the exception of the giant plane boss that shows up four times, looks, sounds, and feels the same. There's just not that much of an increasing difficulty slope in this version of 1942.  For a Game Boy Color effort, Digital Eclipse provided a decent conversion of the NES game to the portable  but it would have been nice to have more payoff for going through the entire game in two short hours. The replay factor completely flies out the window because of the unlimited continues, passwords every four levels, and the overall easy difficulty level.  Only pick this game up if you're a 1942 fan  but even if you are you'll probably toss this game deep in your Game Boy Color collection in a few minutes of play.", "date": "May 25, 2000"}
