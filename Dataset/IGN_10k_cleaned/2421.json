I can play them, I can like them; heck, I can even give them good scores (I have that magical editorial ability to switch my state of mind in such a way that I am able to accept that products that don't begin with Qu and end with ake still can be good in their own rights). But problems are problems, and Backyard Basketball, Infogrames and Humongous Entertainments' latest outing in the child catering series of lighthearted sports games, has its fair share.  If you're not familiar with this product and are over the age of thirteen, chances are you'll not be interested in this review unless the universe has blessed you with children of your own. Nevertheless, I continue. Backyard Basketball is a very simplistic cartoon themed three-on-three basketball game for kids. You pick from a cross-section of varied, extremely P.C., ethnically diverse kids and clumsily run about a court, never simultaneously utilizing more than two keys at any one time to perform rudimentary tasks like jump and shoot. It's a title that will appeal to children regardless of whether they're boys, girls, or interested in the sport (though not the ones avidly following basketball).  The interface and menu system are comprised of large, colorful, distinguishable, and memorable icons that kids should have no trouble navigating and coming to grips with (I make no promises to how well grandparents still physically picking up the mouse and touching the monitor with it will fare).  You can pick from 16 cleverly named teams such as the Fabulous Scrubs, Bombastic Hammers, Unscrupulous IGN Editors, etc., that come broken down into two conferences and four divisions. With a team, it's a simple matter of partaking in either single or season play where the object is to...savor the moment...win!  Like all sports children partake in, beginning a match usually begins with picking players whether that be straight from the benches, sorted alphabetically, or even by their skills. If for some reason none of the munchkins from the large cast of eclectic and often stereotypical prospective athletes (all kids, by the by) interests you, the game allows for the custom creation of a player. Nothing so advanced as premiere sports games, Backyard Basketball's character customization consists of inputting a name, selecting a suitable adjective to more personally identify yourself, choosing from seven hairstyles, three body structures and a multitude of color variations, and finally, balancing out a few confusing attributes by augmenting each of them with a preset amount of points.  Inside Shooting Ability: I'm guessing it has something to do with how well they make baskets from inside the three-point line, but whatever. Outside Shooting Ability: Who knows? Maybe accuracy from three points and beyond? Ball Handling: I don't think IGNCodes' Chris Carle is in the game, so I know it doesn't have anything to do with cupping. Defense: Play that Tenacious D. Quickness: It either has to do with running at a more brisk pace or something with heating and refrigeration repair.  Okay, so maybe the attributes aren't so confusing. Once your team of five is assembled for play, the match begins. While you did pick five players, only three actually participate at any given time, the other two, vigilantly awaiting substitution on the sidelines, could have been called benchwarmers had they not been made to stand.   Typical of a children's game, Backyard Basketball is cartoonishly bright with colors that contrast one another, but is generally lacking in technical quality across the boards. It's a 2D game, so play is done from a fixed horizontal view of the field that scrolls left and right to the baskets as the ball dictates. Animations are stiff and floaty, no outstanding effects exist, and the whole thing is very VGA computer game-ish (gamers of old will instantly recognize the pixilated, seemingly lacking color palette). You won't see it stealing any aesthetic crowns from anyone, but who really cares? It's made to be pleasant to kids, and while I'll always contest that being acceptable for children doesn't necessitate being subpar, the game artistically works even if it is no Aquanox.  The same can be said about the title in an aural capacity. You have sounds that kids will hear and be able to associate with people and actions, but none of them will be winning any awards but nor is there any warrant for harsh criticism. The cast of characters and announcers are all cute. Sure, the poor Italian girl sounds like she was picked up and hassled at Ellis Island, and some of the Conrad esque super nerds are realized with frightening accuracy, but it's all good.  Gameplay is very simplistic. You run, shoot, switch characters, jump, make substitutes, and earn little powerups. Whether your shot sinks or not seems entirely dependant on the attributes of your character rather than their current situation (whether someone is standing in your face or not seems to make little difference). Players also run quicker horizontally than they do vertically or diagonally, which is an odd little thing.  You really don't have to do much to play. Unless you directly pass the ball to the other team or try and shoot from full court, you'll never give up the rock. You can literally leave your character alone and let him sit there on the court forever and ever until the sky falls and no one will bother you. There's no real AI, no in-depth control, no strategy, nothing. But that's not so bad, even though the whole thing can probably be acceptably packaged in a Java applet.   So we've talked about all these little problems and the general ho-hum nature of the game, that, while being decidedly poor as far as the hardcore gamer is concerned, can still pass as enjoyable for the little ones. Unfortunately, there is one problem that I can't let slip. The game is buggy...really buggy. It crashes in the menus, it crashes in the game, it crashes all the time, randomly, frustratingly, in house, in a train, in box, with a fox. Some lock up the system and require a reboot to remedy while others are content with just throwing you back out to the desktop. No, I am not running on some exotic machine. I have your typical Pentium, GeForce, SoundBlaster, Win 98 combination with all of the latest drivers. In fact, I'm somewhat of a freak in that I keep my computer remarkably well maintained, organized, and lubed. I run no extraneous programs in the background, nor do I try anything out of the ordinary (potentially harmful ~tweaks~ and the lot), yet practically every time I played I didn't need to exit the game myself, it took care of that for me. What consideration! Though I'm not entirely sure how a temperamental eight year old is supposed to deal with this.  I love kids, and someday I'd like to have ones of my own (not in the literal sense where I'd be the one carrying them to term -- I'm still a sissy). Like any decent God fearing man, I'm also very protective of them and partial to their needs. Now, because I love games as I do, and obviously want the kids to be happy, I'm naturally more often than not inclined to smile upon or otherwise approve of anything built for the enjoyment of children and not the exploitation of (i.e. a dubiously crappy product whose sole design is to trick them into wasting their parents' money). Backyard Basketball is a noble, warmhearted attempt at pleasing the young, so it deserves props for that. I think it's cool when our industry puts money and legitimate effort into these categories, I think it's even cooler that little bro and sis will have something to play that doesn't involve splitting an ogre's head with an axe or battling cyber demons atop broken corpses. However, I can't arbitrarily stamp an Ivan seal of approval on anything that passes before my scrutinizing eye simply because it's a title for the age impaired.  Backyard Basketball does a lot of things right. It's cute, simple, easily configured, readily accessible, and probably something that'll invoke smiles in the lights of our lives. But, because its single most prominent flaw is so glaring, every other aspect of the game, however acceptable for the game's demo, gets critically demoted. It's similar to when an annoying trait of a person or thing bothers you so much so that you begin to find and magnify miniscule faults in other areas that would have otherwise been acceptable. Before you know it, all you see is red. ~Lennox Lewis fights too conservatively. He's the most boring boxer in the business... And look at the way he drives! Stupid, boring boxer driver! Mr. No Drive. What a damn idiot!~ One complaint has nothing to do with the other, but the first is so prevalent that it inflates the others (so I couldn't think of a better metaphor -- sue me).  If you can get the game to consistently work, then I'll concede that its craftsmanship is quality enough to please children, but obviously not enough to satisfy ~gamers.~ None of its features are particularly merit worthy or substantially awesome, but it is clean, wholesome fun for the masses. The game is not designed for you or I, so don't take and judge it as such. Sadly, because I could not get the bleeding thing to run for more than five minutes without crashing in some horrific way, and I am the one writing this review (responsibly charged with upholding some degree of journalistic integrity), I cannot in good conscious recommend Backyard Basketball as being anything above mediocre regardless of who its for.  -- Ivan Sulic      Want to share your opinions with the world? Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  or send some mail to IGNPC about this story.  A game that is developed for a younger audience should still adhere to the conventions of what makes a good video game. However, when the target age of a game dips below the range of teenager, those standards have to be adjusted accordingly. Not many eight year-olds are going to be disappointed at the lack of a solid franchise mode or the graphical details of Paul Pierce as a child. Backyard Basketball is a dose of sugarcoated simplicity but overall it is a decent sports title for young children.", "date": "Jan 11, 2002"}
