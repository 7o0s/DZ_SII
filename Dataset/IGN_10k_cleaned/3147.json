Soccer popularity is on a rise thanks to the World Cup happening in Los Angeles. And Soccer Kid leaps right in there to ride the wave of the competitions. This game, originally produced for the Amiga, 3DO, and eventually the Atari Jaguar system, was an interesting and mildly successful mixing of soccer elements into a very traditional side-scrolling platform design. Rather than let the concept die, Telegames has made the choice to revive the game onto the 2D-comfortable Game Boy Advance system. And despite its strange little quirks in its gameplay (and the lack of a more marketable, platform-friendly ~fuzzy~ critter in the lead role), this platformer really shouldn't be a game to dismiss all that quickly. Soccer Kid is a real sleeper of an action game on the handheld.  Features Five different worlds Bonus levels Password save Only for Game Boy Advance  The Universal Soccer Trophy has been lifted by an invading alien pirate. Why? Who the heck knows...but he's shattered the sucker into five parts and scattered the pieces in different parts of the world. Who's going to save the day? Soccer Kid, of course, a young athlete with the unique super-human abilities of...a soccer player. Well, hey, everyone's got ambitions. So, it's off to globetrotting to acquire all five pieces of the Universal Soccer Trophy. Starting in England, it's up to you to get Soccer Kid through the hazards of the soccer-hating real world.  Soccer Kid is basically powerless without his soccer ball. This thing gives the guy most of his abilities necessary to get through the different platform challenges. It will take a few times around the block in the first level to learn that Soccer Kid can boot balls at his opponents both outwards and upwards, as well as hop on the ball and use it as a springboard to reach the high ledges. And with all the different things that Soccer Kid can do, it's obvious that the game needed a ~training~ level to get players accustomed to the somewhat complex controls.   Each level in Soccer Kid challenge players to get from one end of the area to the other, picking up the several icons scattered all over the different platforms. There are also a set number of hidden ~cards~ that will unlock a bonus round if every single one in an area is collected. The level designs in the game are very traditional, standard creations, but they do take advantage of the title's soccer ball focus. In fact, that's definitely the game's charm: the ball, when kicked, will bounce realistically up slopes and off angles, dribbling to a stop when it falls to the ground. And even though you can kick the ball way off-screen or deflate it against a floor of spikes, you can always call back the ball by standing in place and holding the kick button. Soccer Kid never has to be without his best mate.  This Game Boy Advance title has a very European flavor, with that familiar dominant use of gradient colors and parallax scrolling. This game is a direct port of the console games, which seemed to allow for a much larger viewing area. The game has to scroll a bit more wildly on the GBA simply due to the more limited screen display, so players will definitely have to grow accustomed to the dizzying motion of Soccer Kid's ~camera~.  The real drag in Soccer Kid is, of course, the password save. With all the items that you can and are encouraged to acquire, and since the game focuses on acquiring items for a high score, and with all of the levels and sub-levels in the adventure, the lack of a cartridge save really hurts the enjoyment of Soccer Kid.        As quirky as the game idea is, Soccer Kid is a good, solid action game on the Game Boy Advance. Other than the focus of the ball as a projectile and springboard, there's nothing incredibly special about the title's design. It just fits the GBA's market nicely. Just make sure you carry a pen and Post-Its to record your progress, and don't expect the password to save your accumulative score.", "date": "Nov 5, 2002"}
