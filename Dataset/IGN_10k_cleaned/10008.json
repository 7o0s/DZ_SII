Junior: Robojam Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/02/12/buzz-junior-robojam-review", "text": "With its glory days behind it, the PlayStation 2 is getting closer and closer to the videogame console retirement home and transitioning from crazy, action-packed games to casual titles for the masses. There's SingStar, more mini-games than you can shake a stick at and the ever-expanding Buzz! series.   This March, Buzz! Junior: Robojam enters the fray.   While Buzz! The Mega Quiz and Buzz! The Hollywood Quiz have put PS2 owners on the spot for visual and verbal trivia, Robojam follows the path blazed by Buzz! Junior: Jungle Party -- namely, this game is a collection of 24 non-trivia mini-games that make use of the special Buzz! controller. Not familiar with the Buzz! doo-dad? Imagine a device you can hold in one hand and that has a big red buzzer on top with four colored buttons below.      So, anyway, you take this device -- as well as its bright colors -- into Robojam and test your brain's ability to tell your digits to punch the buttons. Astro Blaster has you using the big red button to blow up asteroids, Odd Bot Out has you press the colored button that corresponds to the robot that's different from the pack, and Barrel Bashing has you press the color that matches your bottom barrel so that a robot can smack it out of the way while the big red button removes radioactive barrels.   Did I mention that this game's based around robots? The title screen -- complete with a twangy announcer to walk your through your decisions and intro the games -- hovers around a robot launch pad, and once you jump into a game, you'll choose the blue, green, yellow or orange robot to represent you.   Now that you know some of the basics of Robojam's gameplay, you'll take those talents into three modes -- Play Game, Custom Game and practice. Play Game tosses you into head-to-head competition between you and up to three friends or computer opponents to see who can rake in the most points by completing a variety of races and come out on top in a short, medium, long or marathon game. In the regular game, the rounds are randomly selected, but a Custom Game lets you pick the competitions you'd face off in and practice has you participate in whatever single game you want.   Keep running! Yay! You now know everything to know about Buzz! Junior: Robojam. Want some opinions on it? Awesome.   The first thing you'll notice is that the graphics are a bit weak. They're not terrible, but they're nothing to write home about. Simple, colorful and a bit sharp on the edges about sums it up. Of course, it's a game designed for little kids so I guess they should get some slack.    Yes, the age demographic they're shooting for is a bit on the younger side so you shouldn't expect Robojam to wow you death, but you also shouldn't dismiss it as a bad title. Trying to figure out the best release point for the giant robot to hurl your character in Robot Throwing is fun, watching a friend get zapped while stealing metal pieces in Go Nuts! is good for a laugh, and I actually found it a bit challenging to steal glowing loot in Plummeting Platforms without getting burnt to a crisp in the lava below.   If you have kids, they're going to have fun with the relatively simple controls -- my only concern is how long that excitement will last.   Don't get me wrong, I watched Babes In Toyland enough times to burn out two VHS tapes in my younger years -- evidence that kids are dumb and will stare at the same thing hour after hour -- but it isn't going to help that a lot of Robojam's games are essentially the same thing. In fact, I've already introduced you to the three types of control schemes -- big red button only, colored-buttons only and all of the buttons.     Sure, there are a few different ways to implement those sets -- sometimes you're in ships, sometimes you have tools, etc. -- but some of these games are pretty much the exact same thing. Robo-Rollers has you pressing the red button to hop over a rolling laser while Crazy Conveyor has you hitting buttons to jump over color-coded lasers. In Bug Blast, an alien pops out of a colored hole and you press that button to zap him while Mad Mallets is the same whack-a-mole style concept.    A few games stand out as genuine fun -- shooting eyeballs into droid heads as if it's a game of basketball is unquestionably awesome -- but the day will come when little Timmy feels like he's seen it all in Robojam and chances are that'll be sooner rather than later.It'd be easy to roll your eyes at this decidedly kiddie game, but it's important to give Sony a pat on the back. Yeah, this title and its simplistic tasks are only going to entertain the young ones for a limited time, but even though I'd never play these games without the promise of a paycheck, it's nice to see Sony supporting a niche controller.Robojam isn't beautiful or deep, but it is a solid game for families to occasionally gather around, enjoy with the ankle biters and bicker over who gets to be the blue robot.", "date": "Feb 12, 2008"}
