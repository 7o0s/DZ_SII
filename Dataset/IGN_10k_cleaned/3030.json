Electronics Art must have realized this and decided to bring owners of Nintendo's fledgling console Knockout Kings 2003, an exclusive offering, but also a game that is largely rooted in the work done with Knockout Kings 2002. Despite that it's not a totally new product, the new Slugfest mode, new arenas and fighters, and other various additions make this anything but a sloppy port. As the first boxing title available for GCN, Knockout Kings 2003 is most definitely worth your attention.   Features  Lengthy Career Mode lets you build a boxer from scratch, manage him, and turn him into a wrecking machine Earn attribute points based on complex data tracking system that awards you points for exactly how well you fared in the ring Takes advantage of controller rumble to alert you at key moments, such as when your health dwindles Decisions made by well known officials Mills Lane and Richard Steele Ring announcements called by Jimmy Lennon Jr. All-new venues plus redesigns of the old ones for a total of 10 rings to bout in Bert Sugar, expert boxing instructor, provided massive feedback to ensure the styles of the real-life boxers such as Ali, Lewis, and Frazier come to life Supports two-player bouts in addition to eight-player tournaments Detailed visuals with motion captured animations and face scans from the real-life boxers First boxer available for GameCube   Gameplay Knockout Kings 2003 is a blend of simulation boxing and over-the-top arcade punchfests. As a seasoned franchise, it's no slouch when it comes to available modes and overall polish. For quick one or two player matches you can choose from Slugfest, Exhibition, or Tournament, which allows up to eight boxers to enter a bracket-style circuit on the quest for the top spot. Slugfest is totally new to the series, and offers up a healthy dose of exaggerated boxing. You can take all of your favorite boxers into the ring and slug it out with no timer, no judges, and no referee. The gameplay mechanics differ in that you can build up points for Punch-Out style super punches as well as stronger hits in general. By working specific areas of your opponent's anatomy, you spell ~H-E-A-D~ and ~B-O-D-Y~ to earn a one-time, guaranteed knockout punch, which stays in effect for about 10 seconds after your receive it. It goes without saying then that the addition of Slugfest is a very good one. When you get frustrated in Career mode, you're definitely going to want to relentlessly pound a few opponents without worrying about rounds and judges.   Naturally, the Career mode is what gives Knockout Kings 2003 most of its single-player appeal. It's been redesigned since the 2002 version enough that it's noticeable. By using the simple Create-A-Boxer function, you can begin your career with ease. You'll be able to craft your warrior from a number of different options including nicknames, face styles, tattoos, stance (right or left-handed), glove style, trunks design, shoes, a taunt, and even a special punch. You're not going to be able to mold any image you get in your head, but there's enough here to satisfy your base needs. We've got our fingers crossed that the next version will include a much more robust creation mode. Beyond the look of your boxer, you'll have to choose your weight class -- Heavy, Middle, or Light -- which then leaves you a little leeway to customize your height and precise poundage. That's not all, though. You also begin with 200 attribute points to divvy up over your power, speed, stamina, chin, heart, and cuts. You've got to be wise in your decisions, too, because the differences are very noticeable in the ring.   Once you begin, you must climb the ladder to the top. A cool new addition is that a scrolling updater bar on the bottom of the screen will tell you how other boxers are doing, noting who defeated who, in what round, and how. It's a good step forward towards an impressive career mode, but lacks training sequences and randomness, as the ladder is the same for every weight class. Most of the depth owes itself to the fact that you have to perform well in the ring to earn points. There's a detailed stat tracking system that monitors your number of blocks, knockdowns, quickest KOs, etc. The better you do, the more attribute points you'll earn; and, you'll definitely need them as you climb the ladder, because fights get very tough. Fortunately, you can participate in rematches if you need to nab some more attribute points. All that said, Career is easily the strongest element in the game if you're looking at single-player value. It could use improvement, but it's definitely started off on the right foot.     Importantly, it's all backed by impressive control mechanics. The feeling that the player must get when he/she is in the ring is vastly important, and EA has been aware of this for some time. Continuing on that same tradition, Knockout Kings 2003's controls are intuitive and flexible. Basically, your boxer is locked on to your opponent. By pushing forward and backward on the left analog stick, you can position your fighter's distance. Then, by pressing left or right you can circle strafe a full 360 degrees at any time. To further the concept of ~bobbing and weaving~ and ~dancing~ in the ring, you can also lean very simply once your in place. By lightly pressing on the control stick, you can lean forward, side-to-side, and slightly back. This is important when you're face-to-face with your opponent, too, because the punching mechanics are tied to this. Fully pressing the control stick toward the other slugger with result in headshots, but by lightly pressing forward you can open up the body.      It's an awesome boxing engine, even if not perfect. You cannot lean side-to-side when you're in motion. It would have been nice to see some involvement with the C-stick (which does nothing) in this regard, but that would definitely have to be reserved for advanced players. The engine also lacks the ability to change your stance. In the real sport, the pros will change stances frequently to confuse opponents. Maybe in the next version we'll see these more advanced options, which could certainly be mapped to the D-pad or C-stick. Throwing the punches themselves is also very intuitive. All of the face buttons are reserved for throwing the punches: A (jab), Y (straight right), X (right hook), B (left hook). L blocks and R modifies for uppercuts, and, finally, the Z-trigger is the special trademark punch for your boxer.   As a whole, Knockout Kings 2003 is a neatly wrapped package. The artificial intelligence is varied and impressive, Career offers up a compelling single-player experience, and the multiplayer is excellent. If you love boxing and don't own this game yet, go out and get it. It's nothing owners of the 2002 version will want to flip over, but it's a stellar answer for GameCube fans' boxing needs.   Graphics The visuals in Knockout Kings 2003 come screaming out of the corner at a smooth 60 frames per second. The arenas are all wonderfully modeled with noticeably different lighting. The biggest drawback is the lifeless crowd animation. It's clear that the two fighters in the ring took priority over everything else, and rightly so, as they look great. EA has used face-scanning technology to accurately bring their looks to the game. From Ali to Oscar De La Hoya the modeling is superb, accented by specular lighting effects that makes them look sweaty (and a bit plasticy). More importantly, the animation is brilliant. Fighters will bob and weave on their own, which keeps them from looking like static, unreal things. Then, to top it all off, there is real-time bruising that not only looks cool, but also shows off your opponent's weak spot.   All in all, it's a pretty boxing game. It doesn't support progressive scan or widescreen, but from the varied character texturing to cloth and rope effects, it's a looker.   Sound As with any sports title, the color commentary that backs that action is extremely important. EA called upon the talents of Larry Michael and Max Kellerman, who offer up a wealth of different audible notes about the ongoing fights. They'll hint at what's going wrong, what's going right, and even offer up suggestions to each other that can improve you fight. However, there are problems with repetition. You hear a lot of the same comments over and over. The crowd can also be very monotonous. Surround support such as Dolby Pro Logic II is lacking, which would have improved the arena immersion.   The hip-hop and rap-rock music is mostly used for menus and to set the tone of the fight before the boxers enter for title matches. It's a pretty fitting selection, but nothing that will make your head turn. Knockout Kings 2003 is chock full of the latest and greatest pros in addition to 20 fictional boxers. The Create-A-Boxer mode rounds all this out quite nicely. That's a mighty good foundation of personas to build a boxing game on. But, the title is not just about the thrill of using your favorite all-time boxer. The control mechanics are the core of the experience, and they're second-to-none in Knockout Kings 2003. Fighting is intuitive and flexible. Occasionally it can be difficult to hit your opponent where you want, but the system is pretty tight all around.I would definitely recommend Knockout Kings 2003 to any boxing fan that hasn't played the 2002 version on other systems. There are still improvements to be made, but it's a really solid entry into the boxing realm on GameCube. I can't wait for the next version.", "date": "Oct 9, 2002"}
