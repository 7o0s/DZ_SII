The core game play is augmented with smart extras that don't ruin the casual appeal of the original while the enhanced presentation definitely underscores that this is indeed not just some rush job.   Triple Scoop Twist casts you as the budding impresario of an ice cream empire. At the start of your career, you only have enough money to fund a single location, but you can actually choose almost anywhere in the world. I opened a stand in Glasgow, but if you so desire, you can try locations as disparate as Tokyo or the Pinkberry paradise of Los Angeles. You only have a few flavors and toppings during the first few days on the job, giving you a fair amount of time to learn the ropes of running an ice cream shop.   The flow of the game is very simple. You have a series of objectives to be met day in and day out, such as stocking new cones and installing new equipment. You want to do this is a timely manner, but you have to balance the books, too. If you spend too much capital early on to buy up available upgrades, you may run low on money to restock the essentials, such as sugar cones and vanilla ice cream. When you build up a location to a certain degree, you can expand your operation in another city that offers different customer patterns, due to population and weather.   While manning the shop, you serve up cones to a variety of customers, all expertly drawn by a very talented artist. Kids, hat hard macks, swells, zombies, and snowmen will show up at your counter, demanding a sweet treat. When you scroll over a customer, you see their order. You must quickly memorize it and then press up to start assembling their treat from three tiers of ingredients. The first tier of items is cones, the second is ice cream, and the third is toppings. When you spot the desired ingredient, you press down. This plops a scoop of chocolate or a handful of sprinkles on the cone. Press OK to serve it up and collect your cash. The more cones you correctly provide in a row, the higher your tips.   The game can get pretty hairy after eight or nine days when orders string almost allt he way across the screen, as people want goofball combinations like coffee ice cream and rainbow sherbet, smothered in hot fudge, bananas, and cookie pieces. All in a dipped cone. At the end of really bust days, you'll have to fend off a rush by playing a ~match the arrows~ minigame minigame. And then there's the robber that sticks a gun in your face and must be talked out of taking $100. (Hint: Install a security camera to keep the buzzards away.)   Once you find the rhythm of the game, it's very addicting. The controls are intuitive that once you have it down, you'll only have your faulty short term memory to blame for screwing up an order. I also really like the pacing, how the game doesn't overwhelm you with too much new stuff at once, but doles it out so there is always something new to play with.   Now, aside for the general appeal of the ice cream theme and the excellent game play, the longevity of Triple Scoop Twist depends on your desire to expand the empire. You will encounter fewer and fewer ~new sights~ the longer you play, but the game's clever newspaper reports that detail the crests and troughs of your empire give you reason to keep going. Can you really build out a worldwide ice cream chain?Two Scoop Twist was an awesome surprise, but this sequel really delivers the goods. Any fans of the original will be blown away by the upgraded look and extra goodies. Newcomers should instantly fall for the game's great pacing and presentation. I normally want excellent games to remain exclusive to mobile -- I'm sometimes selfish like that -- but like some of the best mobile has to offer, Triple Scoop Twist deserves a shot on the casual PC scene as well as services like Live Arcade.
