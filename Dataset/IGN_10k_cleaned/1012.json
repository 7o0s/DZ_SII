So when Core ended up putting the Lara Croft series on the Game Boy hardware, guess what we end up with? You got it  a 2D Prince of Persia. Features 14 levels Five areas Battery back-up Only for Game Boy Color  That's not to say that Tomb Raider is formulaic  among the standard fare of licensed platformers and me-too racing games, it's actually one of the most ambitious Game Boy Color projects out there. Because of the immense popularity of the series (spanning four games on the Saturn, PlayStation, Dreamcast, and PC), it just makes sense to move the franchise to the Game Boy Color. But without any 3D capabilities, the portable rendition would have to be flattened  and that's where its roots really push through. It's literally Prince of Persia with guns, and seeing it on the Game Boy Color screen really nails the point home.  Lara Croft has a massive amount of capabilities, but it's completely up to you to wrestle with the controls to get her to do what you want. The manual documents 25 different moves that Lara can pull off, from the standard walk, run, and leap, to the more complex ledge-grabbing, backflips, and cliff-diving. Because the Game Boy Color is more limited in buttons than the console controllers, the developers really had to work a miracle in getting all those moves mapped  some are intuitive, others are a little more complex. You'll find yourself dying less from the difficulty of the traps and puzzles and more from accidentally hitting the wrong button/controller combination in a panic.  While controls are less than intuitive, they do their job  especially with what the Game Boy Color offers. Even though I could say ~they could be better,~ I honestly couldn't offer any suggestions on how. Luckily some of the moves have been simplified to make things a lot easier to deal with. When you pull out your guns (double-fisted, of course), Lara will automatically aim at the nearest threat in front of her. The artists rendered her bending at every possible angle in a 180 degree arc to make things more natural  but it sometimes looks stupid to watch Lara target a scorpion at her feet without her bending at the knees.  Level designs are also of the Prince of Persia-style, though the constant scroll eliminates the tension of Prince's not knowing what threat or puzzle lies on the next screen. Lara's level structures offer a few new items  utilizing vine ~bridges~ like a playground monkey bars, or finding dynamite to blow up special walls to gain access further down the line. Most of the puzzles are of the ~find a switch that'll open a trap door, go through it, find a key to unlock another door~ variety. Since medical packs are plentiful in the caverns, you really don't need to worry about the bats, snakes, scorpions and skeletons taking away your health. You do, however, need to watch out for those pesky pitfalls and spikes. Make sure when you progress further into a level you look for the Save Game Crystals  these are the only points where you can save your adventure to cartridge. This is quite possibly THQ's first battery-backed Game Boy Color cartridge, and we openly thank them for going this route than offering a nasty 76 letter password every time you want to save your position. I do wish you had the option to just continue from your last savepoint after a death, instead of being kicked to the title screen every time.  Tomb Raider on the Game Boy Color is a solid product, especially in the graphics department. It's obvious a lot of time and effort went into the conversion, and that effort pays off with a great, though definitely not perfect, portable adventure. It's not a balls-out action title  in fact, if you're expecting a maniacal shooter you better leave the game back on the shelf. Tomb Raider is a slow-paced adventure game with loads of puzzles and a bit of shooting thrown in for good measure.  I was admittedly a little worried about the progress on Tomb Raider for the Game Boy Color, especially when Eidos handed the publishing rights over to THQ. But the final product is here, and Core shows off that it actually cared about the conversion  the portable version is very ambitious, with high-color cutscenes as well as a sheer amount of animation frames for Lara.  This Tomb Raider is for the Prince of Persia crowd, not the Contra crowd  slow and steady wins the race here. The worst part about the game is the weird, somewhat fatal controls, but the developers worked with what they had, and within a few levels you'll be controlling the video vixen with ease. The adventure is definitely worth the bucks.", "date": "Jun 14, 2000"}
