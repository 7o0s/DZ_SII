Interest in Activision's Pro Skater series never wanes, despite the fact we're almost upon the fifth installment. But while T.H.U.G. is finalized for console cowboys, cellphone gamers are just getting a portable version of the fourth game.  Is this one of those times when patience is a virtue, or one of those times when we need to round up the folks who make up phrases like that and poke them with sticks.  Sharp sticks.  Features:  Fourteen skaters Six locations Codes for the next-gen console versions  Tony Hawk is actually kind of a complicated game.  All the thumb-busting combos and whatnot you need to pull of to achieve a respectable score can be a real pain.  As expected, the handset version is simplified -- almost delightfully simplified.  Sure, there are plenty of tricks to bust out -- grinds, nosepicks, tailslides -- but on that itty-bitty key pad, it's easy to remember button combos.  There are three tours of duty in Tony Hawk: West Coast, Euro Tour, and Road trip.  Each tour is comprised of two ssub-levels, such as a zoo, Alcatraz, a ship, and a college campus.  In each level, there are plenty of things to interact with, ramps and coping and whatnot. Each tour also has a special set of available skaters.  For example, Elissa Steamer is only available on the Road Trip tour.  Tony, on the other hand, is selectable for all three tours.  After all, it's his name on the marquee.  There are several ways to play the game, too.  After you finish with the tutorial -- highly recommended -- you can engage in some fun free skating, hit a single session, try the trick challenge, or do the career mode and work up your skater's stats.  The venerable S-K-A-T-E game is present, as you zip back and forth across the themed levels, searching out the hard-to-reach letters.  The half-pipe is a good way to beat a plane delay, coasting back and forth across the wood, getting air and finally pulling off an impressive trick.  Tony Hawk actually looks pretty decent for a handset game.  The colors were bright and vivid on the Motorola T720 we tested it on.  The sprites may be tiny, but they move fluidly across the painted landscapes, and in a game like this, sacrificing looks for speed is an acceptable trade-off. Activision's really gotten it's money out of the Tony Hawk series, and with the quality of the games never flagging, they will continue to for the forseeable future.  JAMDAT's handset, go-go version of the fourth installment may not be as complex as its console counterpart, but for some -- like me -- that's a blessing in disguise.  Finally, I can pull off an Indy 900 without breaking my thumb.", "date": "Aug 27, 2003"}
