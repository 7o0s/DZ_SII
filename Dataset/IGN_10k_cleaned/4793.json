Most are caught between a rock and a hard place: in order to succeed these games have to cultivate a following by giving gamers something they can't get anywhere else but in order to get lots of players to buy into the idea, the developers have to adhere to proven models. Lineage 2 is in the same predicament, hoping to distinguish itself by PVP elements but presenting them in world that follows most of the conventions of the genre.  There's nothing particularly surprising about the world of Lineage 2. Rather than departing from the established fantasy milieu, Lineage offers up the all-too-predictable dwarves, elves and orcs that we've seen in countless other games. Class options are similarly unsurprising, with characters divided between the fighter and magic-user disciplines. There is a chance to specialize in your class at later levels but, for the most part, you can either throw spells or swing a sword.  The story as told through the quests reveals a world in decline. There's a real strong ~those were the days~ theme running through most of the conversations and the slightly nostalgic approach definitely helps the game stand out from the ~world in crisis~ motif that most MMOs rely on. To be fair, the world of Lineage 2 is currently in a crisis but the focus on how things aren't as great as they used to be is a nice touch.   As you run through the game world (and there is a lot of running in this game), you'll find the requisite goblins, lizardmen, wolves, etc. that you've come to expect in traditional high fantasy games. Though a few stand, cow-like in the middle of fields, there are monsters who will attack you if you get too close and there are even a few that will call their friends over for a little help when you attack them.  Combat with these enemies makes up almost all of the content in the game. In the in between time, you'll either be sitting on your butt gazing dreamily up at the sky while your health regenerates or simply running back and forth between the enemies and your quest givers. The Diablo-like point and click movement system is a really nice touch (and one I wish was present in other MMOs), but the pathfinding isn't so great. It's nice to click on a point on the horizon and trust your character to get there, but the fences, trees and rocks in the way will cause them no end of frustration.  The quest system could use a lot of work. To begin with, you're not ever sure which NPCs have quests for you and which don't until you actually select the ~quest~ topic during conversation. Half the time, they'll simply tell you that ~conditions aren't right~ for them to give you a quest. Half of the rest of the time, the quest they can offer is beyond your level. This results in a lot of useless running around and pointless conversations. While some may feel that the question mark markers in World of Warcraft are a bit gamey, they definitely direct players to content quicker than Lineage 2's system does.  This can create the impression that Lineage 2 doesn't actually have much content. And while there are plenty of quests to be found in the game, new players will have a hard time finding enough to do. The fact that you'll often have to kill dozens and dozens of the same type of monster for some of these quests does tend to extend their practical usefulness but it also adds to the monotony. You'll have a high time investment for these missions but a disproportionately small reward.   You may find yourself cringing when you decide to repeat the ~collect 100 items~ quest simply because there are no other apparent quests. The ~I'll give you a dollar for every orc you kill~ quests are more approachable but hardly provide a compelling reason to keep playing. When you do get a complicated or multipart quest, you'd better write down what you need to at each stage as you'll find that the quest journal fails to provide you with enough guidance and direction. This can be a real pain in the ass in the sequential errand running quests. At least give us some waypoints.  There should be more quests early on that lead the player to new quest givers or at least different areas of the world. As it is, there's almost no scripted incentive to strike out in new directions or see new sites until you get to higher levels. I certainly don't want the game holding my hand every time I step out of town, but having three or four early quests that led to new areas where more quests could be found would definitely help add a little more flexibility to the experience.      On that subject, I'd also like see more character differentiation at lower levels. Knowing that my Dwarven fighter is just like every other Dwarven fighter the first ten or twelve levels isn't terribly exciting. It's bad enough that the characters are so generic at the start but by level ten I'd like to have a chance to distinguish my character from others of the same race and class. You might be able to stand out based on your equipment but, honestly, until you get to the higher levels, you simply won't have enough money to buy anything terribly unique.  The graphics are a bit of a mixed bag. I quite like the overall look of the game and the various environmental effects are generally well done. It seems as if the whole game has a  gauzy sort of filter over it and this really helps to contribute to a dreamy, fantastic atmosphere. A few small issues like bizarre shadow outlines and strange colors can be a bit distracting but, as I said, these are small issues when compared to the overall impression the game's visuals makes.  In terms of character models, I've already complained that there's just enough variety but the choices you do have are beautiful. I think the women in Lineage 2 are some of the sexiest every put in a game. I'll even admit to being hypnotized by the jiggling that female characters exhibit when running. For some strange reason the artists have opted not to include a swimming animation so all Lineage 2 characters can do is run along the bottom of whatever river, lake or ocean happens to be in their way.  The combat animations and effects are generally well done. Seeing the swings and casts and such while your character is engaged with some fearsome enemy really helps increase the level of excitement. The fact that you and your enemies will have arrows sticking out of their bodies when you shoot at them is a huge plus. Large flashes of colorful light accompany the hits and, while this may not be to everyone's taste, it does heighten my interest in what's transpiring. (Sometimes it's cool enough that I forget to keep an eye on the health bars at the top of the screen. D'oh!) Spell effects are also great and I'm really impressed with the way particles are used in the game.  This is equally true of the environments; the elf city, for instance, drips with sparkles and blue light. The design of each area reflects the character of the inhabitants as well. The elf city is very pastoral with subdued colors and natural, wooden textures on the buildings. It's too bad that all the buildings are the same dull brown color and that most of them are completely empty, but the vine-like scrollwork is a real treat. The Dark Elf city, by contrast, it carved from obsidian and resembles a Geiger-esque temple.   Lineage 2 has a neat PVP system based on Karma. Players who kill other players are flagged in red. The only way to remove this stain is to die a lot or hunt monsters above your level (which will cause you to die a lot; talk about two birds with one stone!). This is an important goal as red players can be killed with impunity by any other player in the game. There's an in between stage where your character is flagged as purple; this is used for players who hit but don't kill other players or player who defend themselves against a purple player's attacks. There's no PVP conning system in though so you'll need to make sure that you have the upper hand before taking on other players.  The promised clan war and castle sieges that would really start to make the game stand out a bit more have yet to make their way to the live servers. We anticipate that this will bring a new level of sophistication and challenge to the game but it's something that will be more appealing and useful for hardcore players with higher level characters than for more casual players.While I can understand that old school MMOers enjoy the game's familiar feel, other recent MMOs have gone beyond the simple ~kill monsters, get neat weapon, kill tougher monsters~ mechanic that seems to drive Lineage 2. In the absence of a compelling and original game world, this type of gameplay just doesn't hold much interest for us anymore.A lot of the game's fans are holding out for the upcoming siege elements. Unfortunately, this is the same sort of weakness we saw in Shadowbane; both games have compelling and original content for high-level characters but there's precious little to keep us playing until we reach high enough levels to participate. I can't simply go through the motions, grinding out level after level in anticipation of greater fun to come. I want something fun now, not twenty levels from now.", "date": "Jun 19, 2004"}
