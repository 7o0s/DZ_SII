However, a game based on Reboot, a computer-generated television cartoon about a computer that plays games, is a no-brainer.  You'll take the role of Bob, guardian of Mainframe City. The evil Megabyte is out to destroy Mainframe by sending tears into the city. Once above Mainframe, the tear will allow viruses to enter from the Net and wreak havoc. Your job is to collect the tears before they open. But it won't be easy, Megabyte will be throwing robots, flying tanks, and other nasty bad guys to hassle you. Sound fun? Suprisingly, it is.  The game's environments are completely polygonal and look almost identical to its cartoon counterpart. In fact, this game has over 20 levels to race around in on your zipboard. And what's really cool is that Electronic Arts has added in some skateboard elements to use and abuse while your trying to save Mainframe City from the evil Megabyte.  Not to nit-pick, but it should be noted that the digital control is garbage. On the other hand, if you have an analog controller, you'll like the way the game plays -- it's so much more fluid and really makes you feel like you're on a zipboard.  Although this game doesn't really break any technological or graphical boundaries, Reboot is a fun game. If you're a big fan of the Reboot series, and you want to be the Bob of Mainframe, pick up Reboot -- it's better than watching reruns.", "date": "Mar 19, 1998"}
