You may not put much effort into Konami's NBA In The Zone 2000 but it's not because of how well the game is performing, that's for sure. The problems with the game begin with the look and animation and end with the lackluster polish and rugged feel of ITZ2000. We did manage to find one fairly redeeming quality but it's not going to be enough to get Konami's hoop title over the hump.  Features  Realistic motion-capture animations and real-arena ambient sounds. Advanced play-calling techniques, and play-by-play from NBA announcer Ray Clay. Pinpoint passing enabling you to play like a pro. A return of your favorite contests: slam dunk and three-point shootout. Four-player support. Choose from from all 29 NBA teams. Controller Pak support.   Gameplay It's really tough right from the start. You don't want to spend too much time looking at ITZ because of the awkward player animations and awkward player models. If you do catch yourself overlooking the shoddy visuals and engaged in a game you'll notice something else besides the constant bobbing and hopping as players meander up and down the court. The turbo trigger is not really your friend.   We know a little boost of speed is intended to give you an advantage in any game, but in ITZ the acceleration when you hit the turbo is so fast that you'll think you're watching some bullet-time effects from an old Kung-Fu movie. Everybody else on the court will be moving at normal speed but you'll be racing by at 1000mph like a hardcourt Sonic the Hedgehog. This is just an example of the things that went wrong in ITZ2000.  But the majority of the gameplay problems are directly linked to the dangerously bad visual elements. You can't enjoy the beauty of a pick and roll or calling plays on the fly if you can't even recognize the moves the players are pulling off. Basketball is a tough enough to translate into an entertaining sim without handicapping it with poorly done mechanics.   We did however get some enjoyment out of the dunk contest. It takes quick reactions and precise movements but that's just the way we like our Konami sports games to be. After attempting and failing all kinds of simple dunks for pitiful points, we just threw caution to the wind and started attempting the most daring dunks we could. We finally pulled an 360 of-the-back-board dunk for a perfect score of 50 and after all that button mashing it certainly felt worth it.   The quarter, half and whole circle analog stick combinations done in conjunction with some perfectly timed A-button (running) and B-button (jumping) reminded us of some classic finger blister Konami games of the past. Of course the athletes in the dunk contest only look and move slightly better than their 5-on-5 counterparts even though they're on the court by themselves.  Sound  The music is not bad and tolerable for the most part, but those sound effects are brutal. We like the announcing of Ray Clay, we just wish he had more cool stuff to talk about.   As we said the sound elements are really handicapped by the specific sound effects that are intended to bring basketball leaping out of your television for a complete experience. The bouncing ball doesn't sync up with the sound of the ball hitting the floor. The sound of the ball bouncing itself sounds like a random gunshot. When the ball goes out of bounds we think it's supposed to be a buzzer that goes off, but it sounds more like a microwave oven going off when your food is done.   The crowd reactions are appropriate and rise and fall with the action on the court and the music is appropriately for the NBA. Lots of hip-hop, techno-flavored tunes.  Graphics Oh boy. If last year's game looked like an SNES game, then ITZ2000 is a second or third generation SNES hoop game as far as looks are concerned. We can understand why ITZ99 came out in February of last year with the lockout and all, but ITZ2000's mid-season arrival didn't appear to be enough time for the team at Konami to sharpen up the graphics.  The players are tiny and still fuzzy --though not totally blurry like other ITZ games-- but they still have extremely choppy animations. Not looking good and not moving well are two very bad characteristics in a hoop game where there's really nothing else going on except the player movements. The running animation is very basic along with the animations for jumping, shooting and everything else. Guys seem to go from both feet on the ground, for example, to having one foot up and one foot down almost instantly. There aren't enough transitional frames of animation.  This goes for the Dunk Contest as well. The player models are bigger but they still have choppy looking movement. This is a problem if you want gamers to appreciate and recognize the subtle beauty of a behind-the-back windmill jam.    The menus may secretly tell the story of  ITZ's graphics problems because the glowing stylized letters look as charming in 2000 as they did back in the late '80s and early '90s.  I can't really say I was disappointed in ITZ2000, because I made sure not to expect too much from the game. However, just because I've protected my fragile feelings from the title's shortcomings doesn't mean everyone can do the same. ITZ doesn't offer anything over the other N64 hoop games except for the slightly entertaining dunk contest. Kobe Bryant 2 looks better, NBA Live 2000 has more NBA flavor and NBA Jam 2000 offers at least one genuinely fun multiplayer mode. If you don't think the dunk contest justifies your 50 bucks then you're probably better off getting your basketball fix elsewhere.", "date": "Mar 1, 2000"}
