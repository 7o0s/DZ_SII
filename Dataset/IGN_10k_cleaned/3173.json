In fact, Infogrames' first person shooter was carrying the hearts of doe-eyed Xbox owners well before MechAssault, Ghost Recon and NBA 2K3 were ever announced because this was the game, we were told, that would make Xbox Live worth having. Several years and countless delays (of Xbox Live, not UC) later, Unreal Championship has arrived as all of that. It doesn't do much beyond its Unreal relatives on PC, but then again matching those efforts on console is quite an accomplishment itself. The built-in fun of online multiplayer gaming through Xbox Live plus a solid, fast-twitch, first person shooter engine are the game's undeniable strengths and make up for some of the game's technical shortcomings. Single PlayerFor the solo gamer, Unreal Championship offers a full, but not quite hearty menu of games for you. But let's be realistic here. The single player game is really nothing more than a sparring session for the real meat and potatoes of Unreal Championship: multiplayer on Xbox Live. With decent bot A.I. and a well tuned ladder system for the various types of team games, the one player game is as good as you can get without including a mission-based storyline.The developers wanted to get you used to playing and working well with teammates so in the single player game you draft a squad of free agents who will run with you throughout the game. Each of the 45+ characters in the game has unique skills, dispositions and default weaponry and their skills will develop over time. Developing your five teammates has more to do with their inherent skills and the natural positions you have them play (offense, defense or freelance) than anything you'll actually be doing to them during the game. You set up your team in the beginning of your single player campaign and after that you're stuck with those guys. You can change their positions and issue commands in real time during the run of the game, but most of your important decision come in the beginning. For example it's probably better to get a nice mix of guys with different weapon tendencies and different dispositions than to have a whole lot of warriors who play the same. A guy with high accuracy, low agility and high tactics, who just happens to like the lightning gun might be a good warrior to have on defense for those CTF games you'll be playing. Or maybe he'll make a good freelancer where he'll find a good spot to cover his teammates during a match. There are different races in Unreal Championship and each has unique attributes that will factor into their (and your) gameplay style. This combines with the dispositions, skills and weapon tendencies above to make for some unique encounters between and amongst competitors. The Juggernauts are predictably slow but extremely tough, while the Automatons jump and dodge like super badass robotic acrobats. You get the idea. But sometimes you'll notice how some races will have more or less default health points than another or how Nightmares can be super tough to beat once they get on a hot streak of kills since they get stronger as they dish out more and more death. The adrenaline boost system adds a nice extra level of strategy to Unreal Championship beyond all of the quick twitch jumping and blasting. Collecting adrenaline pills scattered throughout arenas, and in some cases scoring kills, will boost your adrenaline counter until it gets to 100. Once it's full, you'll have access to Regeneration, Invisibility, Berserk and Agility powers. Regeneration uses your adrenaline points to replenish your health and shield to their maximum capacities. Agility accelerates your dodges and jumps to speeds that'll make you an extremely slippery target. Invisibility is pretty much self explanatory, while Berserk increases your attacking power.   With adjustable control sensitivity, inversion options, auto aiming and other options, you will be able to find a control scheme in Unreal Championship you're comfortable, but the default settings are well tuned for the most part. One tiny gripe is the difficulty with dodges since not all double leans on the analog stick will register as reliably as double presses on the D-pad. Switching to the D-pad for controlling your character in the middle of a firefight however, just doesn?t feel natural. The weapons of Unreal Championship are every bit as satisfying as the tools of destruction found in its big brother games on the PC. We've already done a full feature on the guns you'll be using so please check that out for more information on the guns. For the purpose of the review, however, we'll just use the blanket statement that they all rock if you know how to use them and you'll rarely get a gun that makes you whine ~Aw man, now I'm gonna get smoked because all I have is a lame gun.~ The shield gun and teleportation gun could make you say that but they don't really count because they're not intended to hurt enemies, just protect you and teleport you.MultiplayerThis is why and where Unreal Championship takes the cake as the best Xbox Live launch game. With a variety of multiplayer game modes, all of the match customization features every online game (Xbox Live or otherwise) is supposed to have and sweet, sweet downloadable content already waiting for you, it's doing more for Microsoft's online gaming service than any other single launch title. It's simple but effective approach of taking everything in the main single player game and replicating it online where every character is controlled by a human --and therefore should not suck-- will give Xbox owners an extremely reasonable facsimile of what PC owners are getting in Unreal Tournament 2003.The game modes include Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Survival, Capture the Flag, Bombing Run and Double Domination. Of these, Double Domination and Bombing Run deserve the most attention because they're relatively original and do the most to foster a sense of teamwork. In fact, Epic Games' new initiative to have gamers approach online Unreal games as sports competition comes through loud and clear with Bombing Run, a sort of futuristic, Kill the Carrier with guns.Bombing Run pits two teams against each other with the purpose of advancing a ~ball~ through the other team's goal. You get seven points (a touchdown) for carrying it into the round  portal-like goal and three points for shooting it through. The catch is the ~ball~ is actually a gun that doesn't shoot but constantly regenerates the carriers health to its maximum level. So teammates have to protect their guy when he has the ball because every one on the other team will be looking to blast him to cause a fumble. It can be a little disorienting at first, but after three or four games of Bombing Run, gamers can see this is one of the more enjoyable, seat-of-your pants kind of team games to come around in a while. The carrier and the ball are constantly surrounded by swirling streams of color coded energy so you should always be able to see where it is and who has it if it's anywhere on screen. Since the ball is a gun, shooting it merely launches the ball itself in whatever direction you're facing. Nine times out of ten, when you first start playing, you'll think you've picked up some kind of badass new weapon when you get the ball despite a big text message on your screen that says ~You have the ball, deliver to the other team's goal.~ Of course in your excitement you'll immediately pull the trigger hoping to see some badass energy beam or missile and instead you've just passed the ball to a member of the opposing team. It is in fact better to pass to teammates and coordinating soccer-like offenses across open areas can be a thing of beauty. Double Domination improves on the previous edition of Domination found in Unreal Tournament. Teams have to capture and hold two separate control points at the same time for ten full seconds. This means teams will have to sustain their efforts to protect control points instead of simply relying on speed to ~tag~ as many control areas as quickly as possible to score points like in the original Domination. Considering this is the first major PC FPS franchise to arrive on Xbox Live, it's a relief to know Xbox owners aren't missing out on any huge innovations in gameplay.  As we said you can set up games to your liking on Xbox Live but there is some when it comes to maps and number of players. Once you pick a game type you can add whatever maps you like to the rotation but you'd better pay close attention to the number of players that can fit in that game. If you pick a CTF map that accommodates 5 vs 5 and then check the options screen to adjust victory conditions, time etc you'll see that the maximum number of players for that map will still be capped out at eight. Either the maps need to conform to the player capacity or vice versa but the system now can quickly lead to a lot of confusion. Furthermore even though we can preserve player slots for our buddies, adjust bot skill and tweak many other gameplay options you still can't simply set up teams to your liking and have at it. Instead, the first online game of your session will be spent trying to get players on the proper teams as they jump into your game, boot out the bots and switch teams from red to blue or blue to red. Again we love all of the game customization options but we just wish there was a way to quickly and easily set up the teams as well. There's nothing cooler than downloadable content through Xbox Live. Unlike patches or expansion packs in PC games, downloading keys to unlock new stuff in your game is the essence of user friendly instant gratification. There are already a handful of new maps ready for downloading but there is one piece of content we haven't seen yet that's troubling us. VehiclesAs in ~Where are the vehicles we were promised?~There are no vehicles in Unreal Championship that we've seen and even though we hear they're going to be available for download in the future, we just haven't seen any of this. If the developers hadn't mentioned it, we wouldn't worry about it, but they did so we are. Points off for telling fibs. GraphicsUnreal Championship's greatest strength is its level of detail, all the more impressive when you consider just how fast paced this game is. Even though UC shares the same roots as the current generation Unreal games on PC, animation on the characters in the Xbox game is nothing impressive. The same thing can be said about framerate, but for different reasons. Unreal Championship hovers right around 30 fps but dips below that regularly. The noticeable lag pops up occasionally when you get into multiplayer games, Xbox Live or otherwise, and can often be mistaken for choppiness. But the framerate is in fact consistent throughout.  The weapons of Unreal Championship give the game its personality as much as the nutty characters and strange battle worlds. The level of detail in the weapon models, their animations and special effects are all well done and exactly what you'd expect from the Unreal franchise. With the teleportation gun, for example, it's easy for you to recognize what's going on when you engage the teleport function or the remote camera function. The instant re-orientation of the first person camera when you teleport is seamless. The green streams of the link gun's secondary fire function look especially cool when they bend and snake across to reach their target. It looks like something from Ghostbuster, the original, not the crappy sequel that continued to ignore the contributions of Ernie Hudson's character. The special effects of the lightning gun make it much more appealing than a typical sniper's weapon with lightning bolts instantly zapping the target. All of the environments are as impressive as the arenas found in Unreal Tournament 2003 even through they have been re-configured for the Xbox. The desert and jungle themed arenas have all of the architecture and features you'd expect from those locales and just about every arena comes with some fine particle effects somewhere in there. Swirling sands in the desert, radioactive vapor in the more industrial levels all add to the already impressive environments.The developers created quite a mixture of unique and easy to recognize characters for Unreal Championship. The Egyptian themed Anubans  come with elaborate headdresses and ancient garments that can be hard to make out when you're zipping by trying to mow them down with minigun fire, but they're there. Catching a glimpse of Mr. Crow's skull-face and top hat during the heat of battle, right before you feed him a couple of rockets in each eye socket, will remind you that you're playing an all-out, fast twitch shooter on your Xbox where the emphasis is on fragging and not being fragged. Even though you may not always appreciate it, you will be glad they're not faceless enemies.SoundGamers are treated to some fine voice samples and taunts in addition to unique sound effects for the various weapons. The only audio portion that's quick to annoy is the woman's voice featured during Capture the Flag and Double Domination games. This nice lady is always counting down how much time you have left until scoring a domination point for your team, how much time is left in the game you're playing, the status of each team's flag as it's picked up, dropped and captured. Her voice can't help but work your nerves because the speech samples are always the same and can be repeated far too often during a hectic game. It wouldn't matter if it were Roseanne Barr, Rosie Perez or James Earl Jones doing the game announcing, nobody like hearing the same thing over and over again.The characters on the other hand keep it fresh as they taunt and heckle their way through the different game types. In Capture the Flag games, your teammates will sometimes notify you when they've picked up the flag or an enemy striker is in your base. Furthermore your team commands will always get a response from your team members when you tell them to attack, defend or freelance. Your character's voice, which sounds remarkably similar to other voices in the game, will call out the insult when you hit the taunt button and they always try to keep it fresh. Plus, there's good old fashioned swearing throughout and there's never anything wrong with that. Unlike our snooty IGN PC editors, we appreciate the color and expressiveness of low brow profanity because sometimes you just have to say ~What the F---?~ to get your point across.The surround sound is decent but much of it goes to waste with all of the ruckus that's usually going on in Unreal Championship. You get character voices coming out of the center speakers and explosions and stray bullets coming from the surround speakers as well. I think Unreal Championship is going to help a lot of first person shooter fans get through the months ahead of us until Halo 2 arrives. Like that copy of Purple Rain in your music collection, Unreal Championship feels like an old favorite that's been there all along and we're just getting re-acquainted with it now that Xbox Live is here. But UC is new and I welcome the Unreal universe to the Xbox with open arms because Digital Extremes, Epic Games and Infogrames have shown us that Xbox Live games don't have to be dumbed-down to the point of sterility just because it's a launch title. The game is flat out fun like a good online shooter should be, it's as simple as that. Putting together your own well crafted taunts over the Communicator --with the voice-masking off please-- is a joy I didn't expect to taste so sweet. I can't recommend Unreal Championship to gamers who aren't going to get on Xbox Live even though the bot-play and system link games are still enjoyable because that's just not the strength of this game. For any of you looking for that final reason to get Xbox Live, this should definitely be one of them. And for those of you who already believe in Xbox Live and just haven't picked up your Starter Kit, you're just reading this review to find something to nitpick about! You know you're going to get Unreal Championship and when you do we'll all be online waiting for you.", "date": "Nov 11, 2002"}
