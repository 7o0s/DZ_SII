Wild Arms is a role-playing game with classic anime style graphics, good music, and a gripping story. This game will surely calm your craving for Final Fantasy VII.  Wild Arms takes place on a mystical world known as Fargaia. The story begins in Adlehyde Castle, where three strangers meet for the first time and team up in order to accomplish the same goal: to save the world. With the help of the legendary alien race the ELW and the Guardians, the three will set out to conquer the Metal Demons.  As the story unfolds, you are introduced to different towns and mazes of Fargaia, conquering the terrain by foot, by boat, and even by the shoulders of giant Golems. Styled like a classic sprite-based RPG, Wild Arms also has full 3D polygonal fighting sequences filled with multiple weapons and spells, uniquely designed monsters and bosses, and some nice looking backgrounds. The music fits perfectly with each scene as well.  Wild Arms also plays well. The mazes are fairly big and the puzzles provide some above average problem solving. Players' attributes increase not by gaining levels, but by solving riddles, stumbling upon statues and treasure chests, and just by talking to people in general. As opposed to just gaining levels and earning spells and skills through experience points, you are going to have to actually search and find your hidden skills.  The true strength of this game is the character development throughout the game. You play as Rudy Roughnight, a Dream Chaser who strives to solve the mystery behind his special Arms abilities,  Jack Van Burace, a treasure hunter out to discover the true meaning of power, and Cecilia Lynn Adelhyde, a princess who has yet to develop her magical strength.  Wild Arms may not be another Final Fantasy VII, but it is definitely a strong RPG filled with spells and monsters intertwined with a compelling story. For the most part, Wild Arms should please most RPG fans and will surely keep you busy until Final fantasy VII comes out.  Jeff Chen and Jay Boor", "date": "May 21, 1997"}
