And then sometimes, your ass gets spanked. Appropriately fitting perhaps, when comparing EA Sports' latest hardball entry Triple Play 2002 to its better, stronger competitors in the video baseball arena. Unreasonable that it is, even if you didn't parallel Triple Play to anything else on the market it would still be a poor example of how to translate the National Pastime.   So disappointed were we when delving into the mess that is Triple Play that our office gathered around in Druidical-like circles, picking apart features like a hungry pack of vultures. Where to begin in this madness is a challenge worthy of the mighty Roman Coliseum, but somebody has to do it my friends, and that somebody is I.   Presentation Probably the game's shining jewel, Triple Play does manage to capture the spirit of baseball quite well. With a lively crowd chanting and cheering along with every fielding play, home run, and victory just like the real thing. The level of fan-based participation is spot on. Each stadium looks and feels as though you've stepped directly into the actual locations, complete with catcalls, stadium PA announcements, and billboard Coca-Cola ads.   Menus and display screens are unobtrusive and give you just about all the information you need, with the only minor problem coming in terms of size. A little too small to contain all the necessary info, you have scroll through multiple pages to get the data you're looking for. All in all though it's no big deal, and instantaneous satisfaction is yours to command.   Seemingly there could have been a little bit more added to the mix in terms of ~details~. With other games like All-Star Baseball and High Heat throwing in personal touches like knee braces, hundreds of different stances, and similar tidbits, Triple Play's remedial amount of extras isn't quite up to par with the rest of the bunch. Sufficient perhaps for the casual baseball fan, but it's not nearly enough of an effort for the hardcore bat-nuts out there.   Graphics Visually Triple Play is moderately acceptable and resembles at best an early-generation Dreamcast sports title, but it's in this department that you slowly begin to see how development was greatly underappreciated. Admittedly beautiful skylines, and superior stadium recreations can't even begin to hide the problems with the rest of the ocular bogtrotter.   Cartoony to a flaw, the character models are hysterical. With gigantic and bulbous body-snatcher heads stacked on top of deformed wicker-inspired bodies, watching the players float back and forth over the plate is an exercise in self-induced pain. Even worse are the texture mapped faces; horribly out of focus, gruff, and expressionless, the terribly disproportioned mugs would fare better on a milk carton.   Another question mark surrounding the textures is the unoptimized grass and uniform slabs. Nowhere near as convincing as the equally disturbing Xbox version, or the aforementioned High Heat and All-Star Baseball discs, the bright shimmering sea of color doesn't lend much credibility to the fact that this is supposed to be 128 bits. At least the animation fares better than the chop shop Xbox rev, with much smoother movement and less sudden pauses.   Until you hit a home run, that is. Suddenly missing every other frame once a long ball's been hit, the supposedly dramatic moment is highlighted by the pitcher's disapproving nod and a sudden shot of the home run king walking back to the dugout. Where's the glorious trip around the base paths? Where's the ecstatic celebration that we've come to expect when the greatest moment in sports goes sailing over the fence? Nowhere to be found! Even last year's Triple Play touched on the subject more effectively than this year. How disappointing.      Sound Here is one category that Triple Play should excel in, and instead turns out to be one of its weakest foundations. Gone is last year's squad of Buck Martinez and Sean McDonough, as the legendary Bob Costas and Harold Reynolds fill the play-by-play and color commentary slot. A huge fan of Costas' work for years, none of us could believe the limited machine-gun repeater role that he's been reduced to. ~I'm down with that~, and ~I agree with you on that~, is just about all that good old Bob has to say. Sure he spouts off stats about each player as they come to the plate, but once the action begins he goes soft, and agrees with whatever Harold Reynolds has to say.   Speaking of Harold Reynolds, when did he become mister adrenaline? Usually an insightful and entertaining commentator, the vocals he recorded this time around make him sound like an overenthusiastic sports freak. Ever see 'The Fan' with Robert DeNiro? Watch your children people.   The final cinder block that crushes the commentary to bits has to be its inaccuracy. Plagued with miscalled vocals, it's almost comical how badly our fearless duo messes up. For instance, we were playing a game with the Dodgers and Athletics when Jeremy Giambi launched a missile into the upper deck. According to the game, it traveled 437 feet but Bob chimed in with something about it going 425. Later in the same game Giambi hit another one 488 feet, and Bob proclaimed it a 450-footer. What the hell is that all about? Even more perplexing is the fact that, in the 8th inning, Giambi went deep a third time (great game for him, no?) with Costas screaming at the top of his lungs that ~HE JUST HIT HIS SECOND HOMER OF THE GAME!~. Wait-a-minute...I thought this was his third home run?   Gameplay And now we get to the final nail in the coffin: how it plays. Similar to last year's pressure sensitive batting and pitching interface, not much has changed in terms of how you hit and throw the ball, except the number of buttons you need to press in order to do so. Instead of just hitting the ~x~ key at differing strengths, each button now represents a different pitch. A smart move and a great addition to break the monotony of doing the same thing over and over again, the welcome switch is hindered by a terribly unbalanced hitting and pitching model.   Basically you can approach the batter vs. hitter scenario one of two ways: with a hidden baseball display or without. If you opt to keep the ball cursor visible, you can expect some incredibly unrealistic and offense-heavy games. The first time we fired up the two-player game and went at it, the final score was 28 to 25, and lasted an exhausting 95 minutes of hell. Too forgiving when it comes to making contact with the ball, knowing exactly where the thing is heading is a recipe for football scores. We knew going in that this is more of an arcade game than a simulator but with scores this high the players might as well catch on fire and shoot bullets instead of baseballs. Triple Blitz 2002 anyone?   On the flipside, when you turn the ball locator off it's nigh impossible to hit a single thing (and if you do, chances are it'll be a pop-up or a foul). With strikeout totals in the high double digits, you move from a terribly over inflated game of softball to scrub-pitching 101. Constantly guessing where the ball is going to end up with an already hard to see strike zone could drive an otherwise sane man bananas.   To add even more wood to the chipper, you have the clumsy fielding control. Moving towards the ball at about half the speed you push on the stick, the projectile takes forever and day to retrieve nearly half the time (especially grounders). And is it me, or do the balls actually seem to seek out and find every hole in the defense? It's almost as though the thing is possessed as it goes sailing by every defender on the field. Is it trying to tell us something? Does it want to communicate? What does this renegade spirit ball want from us?   Thankfully, there is one redeeming quality to be found: the Homerun Derby. Better than last years and easy to get into, hitting homers with regularity when you're supposed to is much more gratifying than watching them sail out of the stratosphere like juiced golf balls. Where we spent most of our time when our interest in the single season was over (no franchise modes mind you and the simulation of non-player games is way off. Two-time world champion Texas Rangers? You've got to be kidding me.), the HR Derby is what kept Triple Play in the PS2 longer than need be. Overall Triple Play 2002 is a wasteland of should have been, could have been, and never was. With a myriad of problems in just about every category you could think of, any fan interest beyond a two-day rental is quite a stretch. While a change in developers may have been a large determining factor in the lower quality the game presents, the lack of entertainment in this, a final build, is inexcusable. Play this one at your own risk.", "date": "Mar 12, 2002"}
