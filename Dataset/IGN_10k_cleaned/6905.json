The category has a healthy number of contenders, many with admirable features that make them worth downloading. The late arrival of Superscape's Scuba Solitaire, however, should not discount its viability. Instead, carriers should be encouraged to cycle out some of the older hanger-ons in favor of Scuba -- and other solitaire newcomers -- that are definitely benefiting from witnessing what came before and improving on it.   Scuba Solitaire jumps to the front of the download queue with a solid selection of solitaire variations and a winning theme that is implemented with confidence. The underwater setting is omnipresent in all modes, with pleasing-to-the-eye backdrops floating behind very readable cards. Players can choose from a small variety of watery locations, each with their own aquatic wildlife. For example, if you opt for the arctic sea, you'll see a polar bear. Coral reefs bring colorful tropical fish to the fore.   Even better, Superscape has implemented a mobile zoo where you can read about all the fish and animals when not hovering over your cards. As you scroll through the pocket aquarium, you can browse factoids and see the nicely animated models of the animals in a window. Technically, it adds nothing to the solitaire game -- but it adds tremendous value to the overall package. This is one of the features that really helps it standout from the pack.   As for the solitaire? It's handled exceptionally well, as you might expect from a late-in-the-game solitaire entry. Several modes include classic and thirteens. Moving the cards around the screen is easy with the pad, and, as mentioned, it's very easy to read each card. If you're looking for a competent solitaire game, Scuba has you covered.  Most mobile gamers undoubtedly have one or two card games on their handsets, and usually solitaire is one of them -- it's just an irresistible time killer with unlimited replay value. If you dont have a solitaire game just yet, I heartily recommend Scuba Solitaire. And if you have a creaky old one, definitely consider the upgrade. The inclusion of a handful of modes plus the wonderfully implemented theme is worth the new download price. And parents? The aquarium feature is a great thing to hand off to younger players in the fam. A great download -- very recommended.", "date": "May 23, 2006"}
