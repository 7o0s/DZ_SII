You can take command of the ships of the Royal Navy, the German Kriegsmarine, the United States Navy or the Imperial Japanese Navy. Command the various battleships, cruisers and destroyers at the level of an individual Ship Captain or the overall Task Force Leader. Do a good enough job and you can retire early and let someone else fight the last three years of the war.  When they made this game, they decided there would be no subs or aircraft carriers. But the battles of the North Atlantic conjure up images of prowling U-boats just as surely as the battles in the South Pacific are centralized around the idea of air power. The designers decided to focus on surface ships only. In their defense, subs and carriers didn't play a huge role in the battleship engagements of WWII. There's also no land in the game. The designers decided not to include it because of all the extra work that would have to go into the AI-making sure it doesn't run aground and stuff.  Still, even without subs or planes, and without any land and without surface ship engagements beyond 1942, this game is very realistic. The combat and movement systems are incredibly detailed and accurate. The interface itself is a little clunky but it offers a ton of hinkfo and gobs of flexibility. In terms of performance, the ships are recreated beautifully. In terms of looks...well, you can't have everything. At least that's what they tell me.  The game models over 90 ship classes from the four navies. Germany only gets a handful, but that's realistic. The German Kriegsmarine plan for WWII didn't call for war to even begin until 1946. And of the four battleships she had in 1939, all were unusable by 1943. The USN dominates in the field of battleships, while the RN holds the edge in light cruisers. Plus the USN has cool ship names like North Carolina, whereas the RN chooses sissy names like Caledon or Leander...pfhhh. Particularly nasty are the Japanese destroyers. Because the Japanese enjoy such a huge torpedo advantage, their destroyers should be the first things you take out. Each nation also has unarmed transport ships.  Ships are organized in divisions of up to 10 ships. Ships in a division can be ordered to move and fire as one unit. Each side can have up to four divisions in any given battle. It is possible to control only one division and let the others be picked up by computer or human opponents. That way, you don't quite know where your allies are or what they might do next. The best game is a two-on-two night fight with reduced visibility. Lotsa fun there. New divisions cannot be made during battle, but you may detach ships from a given division at any time. Do this to keep a damaged ship from slowing down the rest of the division.  The ship navigation interface is simple and versatile. Graphic representations of speed and heading allow you easy control. Most impressive is the system for formation control. Ships can travel in either line or column. Column maximizes the fire on either side of the battleline. Line is best used for destroyers with forward facing torpedo mounts. Although it isn't easy, you can switch from line to column in the middle of combat.  Once you've entered a turning order, you're forbidden (verboten if you're Nazi...Frau Jackson if you're nasty) from entering another until the first is complete. This reflects an attempt to keep the division together-although it still doesn't work even if you're the only ship in the division. Even so, occasionally captains make mistakes. You may find that the other captains have trouble following your orders, especially at night, especially at high speeds, especially when the other captain is a drunk. A mistaken maneuver can ruin your whole plan. Although ship collision-and consequent damage-is possible, it's one of the big holes in the game. The physics aren't up to the task of dealing with the reality of it all.  The gunnery model is handled very realistically. You can order each division into one of three fire modes. In battleline mode, ships will fire at whichever ship happens to be opposite them in the enemy line. Range mode targets the closest enemy ship while threat mode focuses fire on the ship that poses the more immediate threat. If you prefer the hands on approach, you can set the targets for all of your ships individually. One rule here is to avoid having too many ships firing on the same target. The splashes from the extra shells make it difficult to adjust the aim.  The game even takes into account the angle of the shells. Targets that lie at extreme ranges will be hit by plunging shot. This type of shell has such a strong downward force that it smashes right through the deck. This is a good way to take out some turrets. Plunging fire can also damage the 12 other systems on board. System damage carries with it severe penalties to movement, gunnery and ship sighting. In addition, shells can start all sorts of evil fires. Fire on a boat, deadly and ironic, hmmm?  Shells always attack either the structure or flotation points of a ship. The structure points are based on a ship's displacement tonnage. For example, the Yamato displaces 69,990 tons and so has 69,990 structure points. That's a whole hell of a lot. But take heart-the Japanese 18.1~ C45 does about 3200 points of damage. The Yamato has 9 of them. Theoretically, they could sink themselves in just two and a half minutes. But damaged ships suffer gunnery penalties so we'd have to factor that in too. Anyway, once all the structure points are gone, the ship is dead in the water. Any damage against the ship's flotation points reduces speed and maneuverability. Once all the flotation points are gone, the ship starts to sink. The three different types of ammunition have differing effects on their targets.  You'll also be firing torpedoes at the enemy. The computer automatically selects the speed and range of your torpedoes based on the current speed and heading of the targeted enemy. You can choose the spread width. Opt for a narrow spread if the enemy is coming at you head on. Use a wide spread for enemies in a large group. There's more chance you'll take more of them out that way. A ship only gets one shot per torpedo mount, so make 'em count.  The crews that operate these dreadnoughts have their own characteristics. There are four levels of crew quality, fatigue and night-fighting. Quality increases through combat but so does fatigue. Often, the more experienced sailors are the more tired as well. Night fighting will only increase if the ship takes part in a night action. In addition to these attributes, there are national characteristics that further adjust crew and ship performance. Each nation has bonuses and penalties to various performance areas-gunnery, repairs, dud rate, etc.  There are 5 types of missions in Fighting Steel. Meeting engagements involve two opposing fleets trying to kill each other. Pretty basic. Bombardment missions require you to reach a target objective with most of your ammo still available. Tactical transport missions are similar, but each ship must slow to 10 knots within a specified target circle. Intercept and convoy missions center around one side trying to escape from the battle. Each of the mission types has unique victory modifiers-bonuses for escorting ships, handicaps for bombarding forces and such.  Fighting Steel comes with 12 scenarios. These are divided between the North Atlantic and the South Pacific. You can take control of the British ships as they chase down the Bismark in the Denmark Straits. Or you can fight it out with the Americans at Second Guadalcanal. The decision to limit the game to 1939-1942 means that you won't find the battles of North Cape or Surigao Strait, which in many ways were the closing chapters for battleship engagements. That's why there's a scenario editor, I guess.  The editor isn't so hot, though. For me, there were far too many steps involved in creating a battle and far too many lock-ups. More useful is the Random Battle Generator. You don't have any control over which ships are included or how they are laid out, but you get to control practically every other aspect of the mission from weather to size. Unfortunately the game will not allow more than 14 ships on a given side and no more than 20 ships altogether.  The Campaign mode is fun, but it doesn't offer any substantial level of involvement. The only, and I mean only, thing you do in the campaign mode is determine whether the ships in your fleet are in port or not. That's it. You control nothing else. You can't form divisions, you can't prioritize repairs, you can't control production and you can't assign sea zones to specific ships. In fact, there's no map here at all. All you have is a list of the ships available. Each turn you must maintain a certain number of ships at sea. If you don't, you suffer a victory point penalty.  At the end of each turn, the game checks for battles and then sets them up like individual scenarios. Damaged ships are sent back to the docks for repairs. Sunken ships can not be repaired. They are replaced with fresh reinforcements. Crews at sea automatically check to increase their quality and increase their fatigue. Crews stationed in ports do just the opposite. They gain rest, but they get soft.  You can set a lot of variables to control the shape of the campaigns. You can select to have a historical or fantasy (USN vs. RN) set-up. You can then set the randomness level for the individual scenarios. At it's lowest setting, the game will weight scenario types to the individual nations (RN does convoy work, IJN spends time on bombardment, etc). You can select the location (Atlantic or Pacific) for the campaign, as well as the length and size of the game itself.  In terms of graphics, I wasn't impressed. The environment was the big disappointment. It really is almost non-existent. The sea states are reflected visually, but not much. There're no big waves and no little swirls where the ships sink. Get with it. I mean I know I always say that I'd rather have a game that played well than one that looked well, but I didn't really mean it. I mean, the clouds look bad...the clouds, for crying out loud!  The ships don't look so hot either but I'm cutting them some slack because the stuff on the ships actually moves. The little turrets spin around and elevate and stuff. The ships are detailed but still look way too chunky. I understand that there are lots of different shapes on a boat, but they could've been smoother. Weapon effects and explosions are nice but don't really seem to connect to the objects they should be touching.  Much better are the little movies that precede the campaigns and scenarios. Everything about them is great. They capture the spirit of the old newsreels with the big red arrows spreading out over the world. You know the ones I mean. But these are more dramatic and actually zoom down to see the actual ships making their way across the oceans. Brilliantly done, and excellent for providing a context to the scenarios.  They're also the only place in the game, apart from the title screen, where there is any sort of music at all. After a while, I usually turn the music of anyway, but what's the deal? Since SSI doesn't care to give you any music, I'd like to suggest a few recordings of my own. Pop in some Erich Korngold or Max Steiner movie scores, especially the one from The Caine Mutiny. The sound effects within the game are just okay. There's a sort of a rumble kind of thing that's missing here. Maybe I'll just hit Trent up for some subwoofers for my birthday.  This game gets by on its depth and flexibility. It is, by far, the most enjoyable and natural feeling naval war game I've played in a while. The interface is dense but refreshingly simple once you've played a few times. Accessibility and visibility are the two big points here. You can find what you want pretty quickly. That's the life or death of a RTS game. The combat engine handles all sorts of real world variables-things I hadn't even thought about until now. The only things that keep it from being better are the sub par graphics and the horribly flat campaign game.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Jul 14, 1999"}
