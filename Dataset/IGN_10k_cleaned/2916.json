Football fans have NFL Blitz, hockey lovers have NHL Hitz, and now America's favorte pastime has been brought to the edge with MLB SlugFest 20-03, the first in the series.    The sport of baseball has always lent itself easily to videogames, so there have been a lot of games that have tried to be perfect simulations, forgivingly arcadey, or a mix of both. However, no company has dared to tread where Midway has with SlugFest, a riotous take on the sport that offers up instant playability, hours of sarcastic commentary, and that turbo-injected gameplay that we've all grown to love. It even does all this with the grace of the MLB, bringing along each of your favorite teams and stadiums.    Looking at the whole package, it's clear that Midway put a lot of work into MLB SlugFest 20-03 to make sure it's first impression is a good one. If you like baseball games and are fond of the adrenaline-style that Midway is known for, then MLB SlugFest 20-03 should be a perfect match for you.    FeaturesAdrenaline-style gameplay -- over-the-top action featuring fast-action batter/pitcher interface, leaping, diving and wall-climbing catches, screaming liners, mammoth deep drives and the fastest game of baseball youve ever seen  MLB authenticity brings real teams, real players, real stadiums, real stats and real player attributes to the field  Fantasy players and stadiums for more exotic experiences  Detailed player faces  Multiple player models, not every character has the same build  Fast, intuitive controls  Dynamic cameras highlight all the action wonderfully  Huge animation library of more than 1,500  Soundtrack brings licensed music ranging from the heavy metal of Dry Kill Logic to electronica bands like Curve  Two-player supportGameplay  SlugFest 20-03 has a fairly robust set of options, that will be very familiar to those that have played Hitz of Blitz before it. Quickplay exhibitions, team-by-team challenges, Tournaments, and even a 52-game season are available from the get-go. The only thing it lacks is a real, multi-year franchise mode, which would have added a lot of longevity to it. Beyond this there are of course all those great Midway touches like personal ID pin numbers for record keeping and stat tracking. Of course, no exaggerated Midway sports title would be complete without fantasy elements; in this case, far-out stadiums based on ancient Rome and players that resemble dolphins, pirates, horses and others can be accessed once you unlock them. To top all these features off, Midway's three-icon arcade passcode system has also been implemented, which offers up a handful of cheats and codes. So, SlugFest 20-03 has a pretty rich feature set.   Getting down to the gameplay itself, the first things gamers will notice is that the intuitive controls make it extremely easy to get into. Above all, this is one of SlugFest's strong points. The batting and pitching interface is clean and obvious, practically complimented by an on-screen instruction manual. Batters can see the button commands such as ~Contact,~ ~Power,~ and ~Bunt,~ while the pitcher has his choice of options like ~Fastball,~ ~Slider,~ and ~Changeup.~ It can all be mastered in minutes, which is very much due to the fact that it is an arcade game. You won't have the accuracy and precision to pitch the ball exactly where you want, but it's not meant to be that type of game at all. Instead, pitching is handled very simply, where you can predestine your pitch type to head in one of eight different directions, up down, left, right, down-right, etc. Batting is equally simple to get a hold of, and you can keep a good eye on the ball thanks to the glowing trail that follows it.    Adding more depth to these functions, the Turbo Meter plays a huge role in affecting your performance. You can add more power to your swings, speed to your pitches, and jump, run, or dive faster with outfields by holding down the turbo button. In contrast to Midway's other sports titles, it doesn't replenish immediately, but rather every half-inning. Carelessly using it to run down home runs or take heavy swings at sure strikes will leave you running on empty. There are ways to earn some turbo back before the midpoint of innings, though. Striking out players or performing a double-play, for instance, will give you a refill on the juice. Complimenting this, the philosophy of becoming ~on-fire~ is still very much in place. Your players will become ignited and gain enhanced abilities with consistent performance. If you stop the opposing team at the play several innings in a row or consistently score, your team will begin to smoke and, eventually, catch on-fire. This results in harder hits and more resilience.      SlugFest is a very rough game. You can intentionally and cruelly bean batters for your own sick pleasure or beat down one of the players on your base in hopes to tag them out once they step off-base. Players who are on-fire will fight back and often knock the ball out of baseman's hand, giving them the chance to steal. This creates a give and take balance, forcing you to choose your battles wisely. In the case of beaning a batter, you can actually affect their performance depending on where you hit them (e.g. speed loss for a leg shot, power for midsection, and hitting for a head bean). But the hilarity of seeing your opponent cringe comes at the risk of pissing them off to the point of becoming on-fire and supercharging his stats. They'll even charge the mound (demonstrated only by the reactions of baseman and a shaking screen, as the MLB doesn't condone that type of behavior) if they get real angry, and beat your pitcher to a pulp. Again, the balance is kept squarely in place by such an element. While beaning Barry Bonds when your bases are empty might seem smart to avoid him nailing one into the crowds, you run the risk of turning him into an unstoppable machine.      When you piece all these elements together, you end up with a very entertaining baseball game that is great cause for laughter and jeering friends. In fact, its multiplayer element is certainly its strongest. SlugFest is far more valuable if you have friends or family to play it with. Not only because it lacks franchise play, but also simply because it's that type of game. It's a high-scoring arcade twist on baseball. That said, games can tend to be lengthy, but thankfully there's an option to choose the amount of innings per game.    The biggest drawback is that SlugFest falls victim to the same thing that the rest of Midway's sports line does: lack of endurance. It's very inherent to its arcade style, and while it's very easy to be ecstatic about it at first, laughing at the sidesplitting animations and over-the-top action, it wears off eventually. To consider SlugFest purchase worthy, multiplayer should be at the top of your list. That's the one element that will keep you going and going.     Graphics  SlugFest is a very nice looking baseball title. Player models feature varying skeletal builds and awesome face textures. Imagine beaning the very recognizable McGuire or Sosa in the head and seeing them in pain. As a whole, the game runs smoothly with decent lighting, shadows, and moderate texture work. There's no real eye sores, and work is above average.   The most impressive visual component is the animation. Everything is exaggerated and comical. As you beat down players you will see them grab their crotches and rear-ends in pain, and the beaning animations are easily some of the most enjoyable to view. There's a ton of detail in this regard and it's all over-the-top. When batters hit a homer you'll see outfielders and basemen begin to throw temper tantrums as they round the bases. It's totally varied and surprisingly plentiful given this is the first run of SlugFest.   Overall, Midway did a really nice job and has created a fantastic looking baseball title for GameCube. No progressive scan support, however, for HDTV users.    Sound  Baseball's biggest audio component requires commentary more than anything, and the bantering between Tim Kitzrow and the make-believe, Louie Anderson-sounding Jimmy Shorts. It's a compilation of completely off-the-wall story-telling to fill silent times in addition to accurate game-calling to compliment the action. You eventually run into repeated phrases, like all sports games, but the quantity is much weightier than we would have expected.    There's also enough environmental ambience from the cheering crowds to the ~whoosh~ of heavier swings to keep your ears interested. No major problems here. Nice execution. Hopefully next year's version will work more on the surround element to further immerse players in the game.   The first time we got SlugFest all the editors gathered around it and filled the office with laughter. You couldn't help but watch and crack up over the hilarious illegal stuff you could do. Midway did more than just turn it into a gimmick, though. SlugFest is robust with options, intuitive to play, and all around well-packaged. It comes highly recommended if this kind of wild take on baseball is okay by you. The only warning I would offer is that after you play it a few dozen times, the high you get from it wears off. Eventually, beaning the batter or performing any of the illegal stuff becomes old hat. It's just part of the game. Thankfully, it does a solid foundation of great play mechanics in place to fall back on. If you don't decide to buy, do not pass up a rental. You're pretty much guaranteed a successful round of multiplayer match-ups.", "date": "Sep 12, 2002"}
