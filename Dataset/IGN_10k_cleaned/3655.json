Over the years the fighting franchise has gotten bloodier and seen more inventive, sometimes comical fatalities, but it has remained in 2D. Mortal Kombat 4, the latest title to bear the Mortal Kombat brand, drags the series into 3D with a tight new polygonal engine that never hitches, but the game does little to improve upon what has become an increasingly stale fighting system. That said, Eurocom's port of Mortal Kombat 4 to Nintendo 64 is superb, and, in fact, near perfect. Despite a few minor flaws, this is, without a doubt, the best fighting game for Nintendo 64.StoryOnce again, the immortals (and mortals) of the series are fighting to save the Earth from total destruction. This time around though, it's from the hands of the previously defeated and banished elder God, Shinnok, who has escaped from the prisons of the Netherealms and is looking to exact some sort of revenge. Raiden, being the well-meaning God of thunder that he is, assembles a cast of the planet's greatest warriors in a fight to the death. Let's face it, Mortal Kombat never has and probably never will win any points for its deep, immersive storyline. On the other hand, as long as Midway keeps figuring out ways to pit groups of blood-thirsty fighters together, well, does it really matter? The game's story is told via real-time 3D cut-scenes, exactly like those seen in Star Fox and Goldeneye.GameplayMany of MK's classic fighters like Raiden, Scorpion and Sub-Zero have returned to fight it out again in Mortal Kombat 4, but the series' 3D upgrade also turns out a few newbies; characters Meat, Goro and Noob Sailbot, none of which were playable in the arcade version, are all featured in the Nintendo 64 port of the game, for example. Additionally, some of Mortal Kombat's newer fighters, such as Shinnok and Quan Chi, have also made the jump to polygons. Developer Eurocom, working closely with Midway, has whipped a truckload of game-enhancing codes as well, ranging from big-head modes to the ability to equip certain players with different outfits.The game plays fast and furious -- and we mean exactly that. The development team behind the Nintendo 64 version, Eurocom, has managed to maintain a blazing framerate that never slows down. In fact, the only thing faster than the game's impressive framerate is the actual pace of the title. Those familiar with the series will know that its fighting system is largely based around projectile weapons, simple, easy to perform combos and speed. Mortal Kombat 4, like previous versions of the game, emphasizes all of the above. The good or bad part, depending on how you look at it, is that while the game has finally made the cross-over to full 3D, it employs the same old fighting style. If you're a huge fan of that style then you will no doubt love MK4. However, if you never liked it, well, you probably still won't. Each character can perform a handful of unique moves, generally the same selection from previous incarnations, plus four new fatalities. Of course, fatalities are exceedingly gruesome, a Mortal Kombat trademark, and equally creative. Players can spin opponents into the fan, which is now in polygonal 3D, and watch as body parts fly in every direction; decapitations are common, amputations, bodies torn in half, enemies dying in a ball of flames -- all the MK goodness has returned. We don't think you'll be disappointed. What is a bit disappointing, though, is the game's semi-3D feel. While MK4 is fully polygonal, one never feels as if they are really doing battle in a 3D arena. There is a standard 3D button for strafing in and out of the screen, but the it's not very intuitive and is hardly ever used. Not a big deal, but worth noting.Eurocom has also included a few new, exclusive levels for the Nintendo 64 version and a host of new options. The game features a very useful practice mode which explains how to perform each move and fatality, there are team modes, group challenges and of course, a two-player game.GraphicsThe biggest difference between MK4 and previous versions of the game is the fact that it's in polygonal 3D. The funny thing is that the game never looked so good or moved so fast. Fighter models are well-designed with fairly detailed textures, animating backgrounds, dynamic lighting that wasn't in the arcade version and beautiful particle effects. All of this and a blistering framerate? You bet.SoundEurocom, utilizing the space of a 16MB cart, has sampled music and sound effects straight from the arcade version. It's all in mono, but still sounds great. Lots of digitized speech tells the story of the game, players can feel punches and there's actually an overwhelming amount of bass in the game. Very well done, but c'mon Midway, get with the times and start making games in surround.Highly recommended purchase, especially considering the title's low price-tag of only $49. With beautiful graphics, tight control and excellent sound, the only thing keeping Mortal Kombat 4 from a perfect score is its aged fighting system. The closest thing to a perfect arcade port we've seen in a long, long while. Hats off to Eurocom for the job. Best Nintendo 64 fighter so far.", "date": "Jun 25, 1998"}
