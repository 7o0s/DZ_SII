While it is admittedly not a Street Fighter game, it is a vibrant, challenging game all its own.  Star Gladiators main strengths lay in its unique character design and the special moves derived from those designs. Since the game is set in the 24th century, Capcom has taken some interesting liberties with the characters that you  wouldn't find in a normal, human-based fighter. For starters, only a few of the competitors are actually human. The rest are humanoid, for the most part, and have a variety of weapons and moves. Gore, a strange, big-brained alien, can grow to three times his normal size, and Saturn, a moon-walking conehead, has huge, menacing yo-yos. Aside from the individual special moves, Star Gladiator has implemented a chain combo system, somewhat like Street Fighter Alphas. When you successfully link enough combos together, devastating special moves are produced. Theres also a reversal attack, which can turn your defensive stance into a lethal counter. While the graphics are solid enough, and the animated backgrounds spectacular, the gameplay isnt as complex or as deep as Tekken 2s. Sometimes just mashing buttons is enough to kick your opponents butt. But when compared to the rest of the game, this seems trivial. There are enough wacky characters and cool special moves to keep even the most finicky gamer happy. This bodes well for things to come.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
