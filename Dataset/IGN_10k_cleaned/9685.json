Picking up the license and handing it off to Left Field Productions, Crave brings the biker's name racing back at us with Dave Mirra BMX Challenge. Unfortunately, it should have scrapped the bike for parts and bought some donuts instead.   Much of the game's design seems somewhat similar to Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, a different and rather fun take on its veteran skating franchise, in that you race while performing tricks to build up your boost meter. This setup works fine, but everything else about the game is downright terrible. For one, the track design is abhorrent. Not only will you fly around corners and hop off of jumps only to wind up smashing your face into needlessly-placed objects, you'll often find yourself wondering which direction leads to the finish line. Halfway through each race, the lap layout will change and you'll take an alternate route that can sometimes cross back over the main lap in a T section or something similar. There sometimes aren't arrows here telling you which way to turn, and you'll have to guess the first time through and hope you remember the second.   This looks like it could be fun. It isn't. Though the back of the box says that there are 22 tracks, this really isn't the case at all. You first play through the stages on the default difficulty, and then you play through the same set again on Pro. Playing through the same course twice with different AI difficulties doesn't magically turn it into two different tracks.   Though this mathematical issue really doesn't have much to do with how bad the game is, the extreme ease with which you'll breeze through the game is. On both the Novice and Pro difficulty levels of the Race Contests, we won by what was probably an average of about 40 seconds on every race. The closest race in the Novice circuit was when we won by only about 18 seconds, though the closest Pro race was a little tighter when we only won by 10 seconds. Keep in mind that these were our first attempts (or second while on Pro) at each course, so shortcut knowledge and such wasn't to our advantage.   If you were riding that rail, the pole would end you. Good times. The trick setup in the game is a bit different than what we saw on the original PSP release. Instead of being able to play each track as a trick attack, you'll find a couple preset areas for this, but you'll also be able to earn stars during a race to help you progress by way of your trick output. This does give you a bit of extra incentive to show off your bike skills, but there are still fundamental issues here as the controls are rather unforgiving. You don't latch onto grinds as easily as you might expect, and sometimes you'll just bail when you should have laid a peg onto the wall. Yanking the Wii Remote upward to jump isn't as precise as pressing a button, and the double-tap to engage a manual is extremely hit or miss. It's also a bit awkward in that your turning controls are assigned to tilting the Wii Remote but your tricks are on the D-Pad, which made us try and use the directional pad to turn after performing a trick more than once.Dave Mirra BMX Challenge a terrible racing game, and it's an even worse trick game. You might as well save yourself some cash and just stab yourself in the eye.", "date": "Dec 5, 2007"}
