But with the introduction of Sony's PlayStation 2, EA truly has been able to capitalize in full on the things it's worked so hard on doing each year -- improving AI, creating more realistic looking players and improving their animations, and creating a sense of depth, play balance, and realism.   Believe it or not, the PS2, or EA's early understanding of the PS2, has helped its soccer development team to realize the game's potential more than ever before. With this game, more polygons onscreen doesn't necessarily only mean ~more of everything.~ With FIFA 2001, the game not only looks better because of more polygons, but it animates better, it's more realistic, and it flows very closely along the lines of reality to persuade and entrance our eyes, and therefore, our minds, into believing its fluid lifelike existence. Like a well-orchestrated concerto, EA's FIFA has come together better than ever before, and just like Madden NFL 2001 was to the sport of football, FIFA 2001 has become to the sport of soccer -- the best soccer of its kind on any system.    Gameplay FIFA has made the big graphic jump into the next generation, but as I've said before, it's also breached the gameplay gap between system as well. Sporting one to four player options, a first for the series, and 50 national teams from more than 15 different leagues as well as the MLS, the simple act of choosing is a little overwhelming. Picture it this way, there are 17 leagues, and FIFA features all the teams and every single player from all of them. Woah (dude). The typical EA menu enables you to choose from a good variety of modes, and any team from any division, including a bevy of teams from Holland, Africa, England, and well, you name it, are there fo the picking. Each team has a characteristic gauge next to it indicating its strengths and weaknesses as well. (Oh and um, Manchester United and Brazil? They're uh, pretty good. Yep.)   Players can get in a quick game with Exhibition mode, which provides players  with their favorite team pitted against any other in the world. World Cup mode provides players with the chance to play in the World Cup final as, let's say, Japan, or one of 46 other international teams. League mode gives players the chance to play through a full season with their favorite club team from England, Spain, Germany, Italy, or to play through Major League Soccer. The U-23 World Championship Mode enables players a taste of the future as they play as one of the 16 top Under 23 National teams in the world. Last, the fifth mode, Training, enables players to perfect his or her skills in specific areas, such as penalty kicks, corner kicks, free kicks, passes, or throw-ins, and provides players with a full scrimmage match.   Good standard features inside the game include the In Game Management and In Game Tactics features, which enable players to manage the team and to call plays on the fly. Another nice feature is the ability to enable players to set the matches in the day, evening or night times. The lack of modes has never been EA's problem.   Righteously enough, where FIFA has improved over the good Japanese version is at least three fold. The most notable aspect of the Japanese version was its irritating slowdown, and after dozens of matches and a few seasons I can report that I have yet to experience any slowdown at all in the North American version. I also went back and played the Japanese version of ISS for the PS2, and it too suffers from dramatic slowdown shifts that spoil the game as well. FIFA has none of it. The number of player head models has increased as well, so along with a good variety of body models, the game now looks a lot more representative of an international sport. Lastly, players can invite three friends to join in and play in the four-player mode; three on one, two on two, you get to choose.   EA never rewrites the books on its games. Rather, it's into slow methodical enhancements. FIFA now has a shot power meter that functions much like Konami's shot meter works in its titles, and it's a good addition. Also while the goalie and corner kick meters have been adjusted, players can choose the particular player they want to send the ball to by selecting a button and sending it that way. The balls can be kicked straightaway or with curves, angles, top spins and under spins.   The third biggest point is that the overall sense of ball handling is exceptional. The ball physics, which up until the last World Cup game were rather shoddy, have continued to improve over the years, and in this version they're excellent. I still wish the ball rolled with a little more realism, but hey. But what's very noticeable in looks and feel is the way the players handle the ball. When the ball hits a player's chest, it thuds, bounces off with a controlled impact, lands at the players' feet, ready for dribbling. Players have far more precise contact points in player-ball collision than in any other EA game ever. Furthermore, bicycle kicks, headers, and a handful of tricky dribbling moves are handled deftly and are more believable and fun to pull off as well.   The through pass, which was a little iffy in the Japanese version, has been worked on, and is closer to Konami's game than ever before, though it's handled differently. With a default camera angle, if you're not careful you'll lose the ball, or it'll be intercepted. In fact, EA's upping of the defensive AI in this particular area -- picking off passes -- is quite good. With an open field and a sloppy pass made, you lose the ball, just like in real ball. EA has programmed the players to follow through in their zones more efficiently and to support the ball carrier more effectively on offense, or by sticking with a player more tightly on defense.   Weirdly enough, the sprinting button provides two different reactions. When I play, I can see my player, while on offense, losing the defender, but he never looks like he's actually running faster. It seems like his legs don't move any faster, even though he is. When I have seen other people play, he looks like he really is running faster. I only mention it because while the function works, it's perplexing to see a player move faster without moving his legs any more than normal.   Graphics If you don't follow soccer internationally, pro athletes who've endorsed soccer games for the last few years have been a little weird...looking. Don't get me wrong, but some soccer players are freaky looking, with really messed up hair. I'm not naming names, but it's nice to see that EA has taken care of any future bad hair days by selecting Ben Olsen, the starting mid-fielder for DC United, as the game's ~spokesperson.~   Now that the hair thing is out of the way, FIFA is a graphic knockout. There is very little to complain about. FIFA is absolutely gorgeous. Player models are composed of nearly 20 times the number of polygons per player than any previous game in the series, and their articulate movements, whether it's dribbling animations, conservative or hard slides, twisting their bodies, or kicking bicycle kicks, they're all fantastic. What's more, players are varied, realistic looking, and come in different heights and shapes. You'll recognize lots of players, many of whom are surely your favorites.    As for the game's overall atmosphere, FIFA scores very highly in my books. Honestly, I like the Japanese Konami game's introduction better, but it's hard not to like FIFA's dozens of after-goal cut-scenes, intros and other in-game sequences. The crowd waves flags, animates at various moments, and is quite functional, as crowds go. Along with the crowds are some great shadow effects, with some complex stadium lighting to highlight their effects.   There is more human realism, too, although my associates and I differ on how effective it is. On the one hand, player's faces animate in anger or jubilation, and it's effective in bringing out the drama of the game; and it's all great. On the other hand, while the cut-scenes show the lows and highs of soccer, the facial animations, in my view, aren't realistic enough to heighten my emotions or pull me in any deeper. Call me stoic.   Other effects such as motion blur, depth of field, a full bench of moving players, groups of TV cameramen and security guards, and solid camera positioning add to the overall thorough feeling that this game's goodness isn't a mistake.   The worst part of EA's game has to be its replay scenes. For whatever reason, the replays seem to always provide the absolute worst angles for reviewing a goal. It's remarkable that with such a good looking game and one that was clearly deliberated over in every single aspect, that it crumbles in the replay department. But they are here, and they're consistently awkward and frustrating. Oh well...  Sound In the audio department, FIFA is again graced with some talented and popular musicians and DJs. The game is punched up mostly with the likes of one Moby, and perhaps you will hear too much of ~Bodyrock,~ but that's the big one for this iteration. However, for you sound-savvy Brits and Americans, DJ Paul Oakenfold has contributed songs to the game as well. It's quite compelling to hear not only popular music but also music one likes, or rather, that I personally like, and Mr. Oakenfield is certainly a fine DJ get on the game.   The sound team went to town with FIFA this year. The crowd is particularly good. Grunts, yelling, yellow and red card chatter, and crowd chants all make for excellent audio support. Along with a wide array of good sounds, the announcing is kind of a mixed bag. The two great announcers, while sounding authentic and generally piping in with sound advice or commentary, do get a little repetitive. After only the first three games I noticed that in a parallel to Madden, I started hearing a lot of the same old things repeated. That certainly could have been worked on.Depending on your bent, you either like FIFA or ISS, and frankly I like them both, and for obvious different reasons. However, this version of FIFA, despite its slight slant toward arcade-style ~futbol~ is really the very best of the FIFAs, period, and in fact, it's the best soccer game out for any system. Until Konami knocks out a Western version of ISS, Live World Soccer -- and if it truly defeats EA's very significant FIFA for the PS2 -- EA securely holds the axe. The level of challenge, complex plays, articulate animations, and overall smoothness of gameplay is simply superb. FIFA 2001 Major League Soccer comes with as a highly recommended soccer game and is a must-have game for the system.", "date": "Nov 29, 2000"}
