It didn't make it in time for the system's debut, but it was obvious that the game was released much sooner than it should have been, lacking even the most basic of baseball elements...like, for example, stealing bases. High Heat Baseball 2003 could have been penance for the poor work done on last year's version...but all this sequel is, is a tweaked version of the 2002 engine. It's slightly nicer than before, but its flaws are still showing...sort of like painting over a cracked ceiling. Features All  MLB teams and players Exhibition, Season, Playoff, Home Run Derby, and Batting practice modes Battery save (one season) Link cable support for two players (multiple cartridge) Only for Game Boy Advance High Heat Baseball features all 30 teams and players...the game's season mode tracks a single team throughout a 16, 32, or 162 game series, showing both last year's game stats as well as the accumulated numbers earned during each of your games. And there's a batting practice and Home Run Derby to whack the ball around.  Sounds pretty familiar, right? There's a reason...  Honestly, there couldn't have been much time given to High Heat Baseball 2003 because the game features the exact same backgrounds and player sprites, identical season tracking and menu options, and a duplication of pitching, batting and fielding engines from High Heat 2002 Gameplay timing has been slightly tweaked so there's less pauses between plays, but other than that, nothing huge was added or altered to last year's design. You still cannot dive for the ball to snag it before it gets away, batting is still a simple matter of a single button press, and you're still playing on a single generic field regardless if the game says ~Wrigley Field~ or ~Fenway Park.~ And the hushed crowd from last year is still pretty darn quiet during the 2003 games.  But the big question on everyone's mind: can you steal? Well, yes...but it's not as welcomed as you might think. The development team added this feature to this year's version...but it wasn't tested. Not by a longshot. As long as you start your player running at the start of the pitch, he will always beat the catcher's throw. Always. Now, instead of not having the ability to steal, you can now steal second or third base every time. Is it a good trade-off? Kind of, but not really. Man, that's pretty wishy-washy...but it's true.  The biggest visual difference in High Heat Baseball 2003: the prerendered batter sprite from last year has been changed to a polygonal figure for reason's I can't figure out. He animates exactly the same as the sprite did last year, but he looks much less detailed as a polygonal figure since he's not lightsourced or shaded like he was last year. Polygons offer freedom of animation, sure...but High Heat 2003 doesn't take advantage of this. The batter only has one stance, one swing, one hit-by-pitch animation...and he doesn't change skin color to match the proper baseball player's skin color. Maybe Mobius wanted to test out a polygonal engine for its next project or something...I dunno. It just doesn't make a whole lot of sense in the big picture.  High Heat 2003 does, however, support Link cable play for two players...a definite welcome addition. And it makes you wonder if this mode was meant to be put into High Heat 2002 but pulled at the last minute for development reasons...since it's in there pretty seamlessly.   With the fixes made to High Heat 2003, the game's slightly above average. But just barely. As a whole, the game doesn't play all that bad...it's just very stale, it still doesn't have a huge list of features, and just can't match the excellence that Sega created in its Baseball Advance title released around the same time as High Heat 2003. The only thing this game has over Baseball Advance is its two player mode...but I honestly don't believe this game's worth the double purchase just for that option.", "date": "Mar 21, 2002"}
