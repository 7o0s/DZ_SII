Games like Warcraft and Starcraft are incredibly addictive, and also much lighter on the need for fantastic graphics than say a fighting game. UK developer Macrospace has taken a cue from the popularity of the Advance Wars series on the Gameboy Advance and whipped up their own, tiny medieval RTS experiment in Ancient Empires.  Features:  Choose from 10 different kinds of troops Conquer castles and occupy villages Story campaign or 2-player skirmish mode Instant, mid-campaign saving  The kingdom of Thorin is divided, and your twin brother is being a Grade-A jerk. So it's up to you, the true king to get a band of loyal supporters together and remove your usurping brother from the throne. Of course, this is all just minor in relation to what this game is really about - all-out strategy warfare.  You begin the story mode as the lone king, and must use your current castle to build up troops to aide in the reclamation of your authority. The variety of troops is an interesting mesh of warriors, archers, and mystical creatures such as lizard men, gollums and dragons, each with their own look and attack. You essentially spend the game building up your troops through occupying small villages and castles, spawning new troops along the way. The goal of each level varies, but is usually seeking out a character, or destroying everyone, or reaching a certain area.  What makes the game work well is that the presentation value is excellent. Rather than remain in the standard topdown map view for the entire game, battles cut to close-up splitscreens (similar to those in Advance Wars) where you can watch your players duke it out, and float away as little ghosts when they die. The animations are very limited here, but the movement is cute and it plays upon the conventions set in Advance Wars, by allowing sprites to actually cross that little black line, rather than just firing from afar. Archers let their little arrows fly and gollums roll up into balls and bounce on their foes. It's all eye candy, but it makes the fights a little more interesting.    Cut scenes are brought up in little text boxes at the bottom, but even these sport tiny portraits of the speaker, and really do well to flesh out what could have otherwise felt like an automated, impersonal game. The tutorial is also woven fairly well into the story. The interface, like most Macrospace games is clear and full of options, and the movement of your characters is well distinguished with dotted lines and borders showcasing how far any one unit can go. Different units can attack from farther distances, or move more spaces depending on the character, and there's a nice balance here between what each soldier can do. Defense is heightened depending on where your character is when attacked or attacking, and sometimes even relates to the specific character (for example, the normally weak lizardmen gain a little more defense when in the water).  Macrospace has also included some nice little additions to the standard portable RTS formula. Instead of the doddering old, weak king figure many games force you to protect, the kings of Ancient Empires are some of the most powerful and impressive soldiers, and bear a bit of a resemblance to battle-armor Sauron from the first ~Lord of the Rings~ film. However, the king is the core of your army and if you let him die, campaign's over, no matter how many soldiers you have left.  Another interesting addition is that when a soldier dies, they leave a cute little gravestone in their place for about two more turns. If you have a wizard standing around, they can sweep down on that grave and turn the deceased warriors into a troop of skeleton warriors. This isn't an infinite recycling process (dead skeletons stay dead), but what's cool is that either magician can convert the tombstone, not just the army the soldiers came from. So a player could put the beatdown on their opponent, then use their enemies' own corpses to fight right along side them. Keen.  Ancient Empires is a thoughtful, but not flawless game. It works perfectly within it's limitations, but also tends to play very slowly; Even simple campaigns can take a while to speed through. It also oddly brings up the 'End Turn' option after almost every move you make, which you have to click out of to keep from ending your turn prematurely. Sound is almost non-existent (a bleep or bloop might accompany each attack) and as well-illustrated as the sprites are, sometimes they seem a little too still, and the backgrounds during the fight sequences are somewhat dull. However, the maps and overhead sprites are crafted especially clear, and the menu system is effective and not intrusive. It isn't quite Advance Wars, but then again chances are your series 40 phone isn't quite a GBA. Most RTS fans looking for something fun to play on the go shouldn't be disappointed, though. It's not a fast-paced game, but with the option to save at any point and pick up your campaign right where you left off, it doesn't have to be. Ancient Empires is a prime example of crafting the best possible game within the limits of a platform. The developers have really pumped up the presentation value on this one to create a clear, enjoyable game that you can really get into. You can pick up the series 40 edition of the title now for any Nokia phone, or look for the updated series 60 edition with enhanced graphics in a few weeks.", "date": "Jan 9, 2004"}
