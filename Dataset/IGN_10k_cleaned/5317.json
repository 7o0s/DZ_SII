As one of the top third-party publishers on the 'box, Ubisoft's line of Tom Clancy games have become synonymous with Microsoft's console. It makes perfect sense, then, to release a budgeted three-pack of the first three uber Ubi titles, Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six 3, and Splinter Cell. All three are now platinum hits ($19.99 each), but you can get the whole lot for just $39.99 in Tom Clancy's Classic Trilogy.  A simple, no frills pack, the Classic Trilogy comes in a single snap case with all three games stacked on top of one another. Yeah, it's about as cheap as it gets with no special packaging, bonuses, or separate leafs for each disc. There is a very prominent ~3~ on the button to let you know how many discs to dig through to get to the bottom, which is very thoughtful on the part of Ubisoft. That's the only real drawback for this excellent deal.  It should be noted that each of these games has already spawned a sequel, so you aren't getting the freshest content in Classic Trilogy. However, each of these games is excellent in its own right. Along with the original games, you can download bonus content through Xbox Live. That means more Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six 3 maps and new missions for Splinter Cell.  For those who are completely in the dark as to what a Tom Clancy-licensed game is all about, it's pretty simple. Each of these games takes its cue from different Clancy novels, some more directly than others. With Tom Clancy as an overseer to help with accuracy and to provide some guidance for each series, the Trilogy offers three gritty takes on different aspects of military ops.   Ghost Recon follows an elite group of special operatives who use the latest gear to take down threats to America and the world. Rainbow Six 3 puts you in control of Team Rainbow, an international counter-terrorism group that get down and dirty with the enemy. The most unique is Splinter Cell, where you take on the role of lone Black Ops agent Sam Fisher, who uses stealth and various high-tech gadgets to keep the world safe.  For more details on each of these games, you can check out our full reviews.  Ghost Recon - 8.8The original Ghost Recon is a port of the popular PC first-person shooter. A squad-based game, Ghost Recon is a bit unique in that you can hop from character to character with ease, taking command of anyone you want so that you can manage the battles to your liking. Not a very attractive game, Ghost Recon earned numerous fans for it's slow-paced gameplay and online play. The Xbox Live portion is a bit defunct at this point, especially with the recent release of Ghost Recon 2, but it's still a decent single-player experience.  Read the full review.  Rainbow Six 3 - 9.3 The single-player isn't particularly strong, but the Xbox Live gameplay remains popular, even with the release of Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow. Playing as Ding Chavez (no, I did not make up that name), you command three other members of Team Rainbow. Order your men to bash in a door and gas a room, all the while conscious of hostages and potential threats. It's intense and the missions are much stronger if player co-operatively (with up to three of your buddies). An IGN favorite, this one is definitely worth owning.  Read the full review.  Splinter Cell - 9.6Forget Metal Gear Solid, this is the stealth-action game. As Sam Fisher, you go it alone, sneaking behind enemy lines and doing the dirty deeds with no thank you or Congressional medals. With high-tech gun and Batman-like utility belt, gamers must use caution and common sense to master the trial-and-error missions. The graphics are incredible, even two years later, with lighting taking a central role, acting almost like a character itself. Though there's no multiplayer here, it's easily the best of the three and one worth playing, even if you have Pandora Tomorrow, the sequel.  Read the full review. Separately, each of these titles was a great game. Granted, I'm not a huge fan of Ghost Recon, but many others are. That's the nice thing about this set. Even if you don't like one of these games, you are bound to like the other two. However, you can purchase these titles individually for $20, meaning that you are getting one game for free when buying the Classic Trilogy. If you already have one of these games or aren't interested in a particular one, you should instead buy the other two individually. The lack of any bonuses or at least separate leafs for each game, is a big drawback. Though great, these games are not new. If you have always been curious about the Tom Clancy series of games, the Classic Trilogy is an excellent introduction, but it's not an essential for your collection, when you could have the superior sequels for each of these games.", "date": "Nov 19, 2004"}
