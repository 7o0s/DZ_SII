Since then, the first of the set has already been released (P.N.03), one has been cancelled (Dead Phoenix), and very little has been heard on the other two biggies (RE4, Killer 7).  But what is considered by some to be the most anticipated of the bunch is finally about to hit store shelves here in the States just one swift year after its unveiling: Viewtiful Joe.  When we first heard the word Viewtiful ourselves, we didn't know whether to look it up in the dictionary or question Capcom's sanity.  From the limited screens and wacky title alone, we were convinced that the Japanese development team was hard at work creating a fancy acrobatic superhero dancing simulation of some sort.  But when we finally got our hands on a playable version just a few short months later, we were in love.  Since that time, our love has boiled into a raging, incurable infatuation for Viewtiful Joe.  Yes, we realize that Joe is a spandex-clad superhero with a pink cape, but if you haven't already fallen in love with this game for yourselves after consuming our extensive, viewtiful preview coverage, then please, read on and allow us to share our passion.  The Facts   Play as Joe and fight the forces of evil with your hot-pink cape  2D, side-scrolling fighting action set in 3D panoramas  Unique, cinematic combat system uses VFX Powers such as Slow, Mach Speed, and Zoom to obliterate enemy forces  Use your VFX Powers to solve puzzles and take down big, bad bosses  Wacky, cel-shaded, comic-based characters and environments like you've never seen before  Earn ~Viewtifuls~ to purchase additional killer moves and items between episodes  Seven episodes spanning at least 10 hours of gameplay  Multiple difficulty levels  Progressive scan support  For one player only   The Concept We didn't know what to think of our boy Joe when we first met him.  His ripped muscles, stylish attire, and glowing yellow eyes seemed to indicate superhero status, but the slightly squatty frame and pink cape threw us for a loop.  Could we ever take Capcom's new Joe character seriously as an action hero?  The answer is yes, and it only takes a few minutes behind the controller to begin to truly appreciate the brilliance of Capcom's daring design.  Though the story is straightforward, all we need to know is that Joe's girlfriend Silvia has been mysteriously sucked into a movie by an evil force to provide us with more than enough motivation to hop into the red tights and commence with the beatdown.  Strategy Available! Stay Viewtiful, baby!  The best Cube game around is as cool and as tough as they come. Stuck with your V up your A? No longer thanks to our comprehensive guide. Available now!  Get The Guide | Video Review  At its heart, Viewtiful Joe is about as old school as a game could possibly get in today's world of free-roaming, 3D titles.  Aside from sticking to a beautifully flat, cel-shaded rendering style, VJ's gameplay is also a throwback to the days of side-scrolling, beat-'em-up, action platformers.  Comic-styled backgrounds scroll in 3D as your path turns and bends around corners, but gamers will never get sidetracked with excessive exploration -- just keep pressing to the left or right and fighting your way through hordes of zany foes (such as tutu-wearing robots with gasmasks), and you'll advance through city streets, lavish palaces, sludgy sewers, underwater submarines, and other awesome environments that we'd rather not spoil.  Capcom's new Joe superhero smacks with personality and high-energy kung fu. It's this tight focus on side-scrolling action mixed with Capcom's wacky-yet-curiously-cool 2D art style that will keep both old-school action gamers and newcomers alike glued to Viewtiful Joe.  Fans of classic brawlers such as Double Dragon and Battletoads will instantly fall in love with Joe's amazing, lethal, lightning-quick martial-arts combat animations, and then bullet-time junkies who crave the adrenaline rush behind super-stylish, slow-motion finesse will be equally hooked.  If you consider yourself a fan of both, then run to the store now, because this game is an absolute no-brainer for your library.    The Good It may be difficult for some to get a feel for exactly how ~good~ Viewtiful Joe is by just skimming screens and surfing gameplay movies.  It's not an easy game to decipher when your hands aren't on the controller.  The camera zooms in and out; time slows to a crawl and then suddenly blazes ahead so fast that casual observers are often left scratching their heads.  If you were lucky enough to have tracked down a copy of Nintendo's elusive Preview Disc earlier this year, then you've already played a slightly outdated version of VJ's opening level, and you've begun to understand exactly how much ass Joe is capable of kicking in a single bound.  But for the rest of you, here's the scoop: Joe is capable of kicking a ridiculous amount of ass throughout his entire videogame debut.  For starters, the action is unbelievably satisfying.  Players enter the game as a regular, street-clothed kid named Joe who is beginning to awaken the superhero power within him.  Shortly into the opening level, you'll be able to transform into the red superstar known as Viewtiful Joe, and that's when the real fun kicks in.  You'll meet up with old-time superhero Captain Blue who will pass on critical and extremely pleasing techniques such as Slow, Mach Speed, and Zoom.  Using the L, R, and B buttons respectively will allow VJ to bust out cinematically sweet punch-kick combos, dodges, and counter attacks unlike anything you've ever seen in a videogame -- or movie for that matter. Truthfully, if you can hit the punch and kick buttons fast enough (Y and X), then you'll spit out a blurred furry of attacks that'll make Neo's latest stunts seem tame and sluggish in comparison.  There's no point in detailing exactly how VJ's combat system works throughout the game, but we'll just say this: it works extremely well and brings us great joy.  Punches and kicks are very responsive, gorgeously animated, and can be mixed up at will as you repeatedly tap-tap-tap-tap the controller and beat-knock-smack-crush anyone foolish enough to stand in Joe's path.  As you do, you're rewarded with ~Viewtifuls~ -- points that are used like money at the end of every episode to purchase even more awesome moves (such as Joe's ~Red Hot Kick~) and items (such as bombs, boomerangs, or health power-ups).  This system works wonders to help encourage less-skilled players to replay levels, save up their Viewtifuls, and then come back kicking with a more lethal arsenal of attacks, while VJ masters can earn the same power-ups just as quickly by performing higher-paying combos on the first run.  It's a simple, time-tested power-up system that accents VJ's amazing martial arts antics perfectly.  Boss fights such as this are some of the most challenging we've fought. Aside from the awesome action that is the cornerstone of your Viewtiful Joe experience, you may also be surprised and pleased to learn that the game isn't strictly a matter of busting skulls.  The viewtifully cinematic visual effects (Slow, Mach Speed, and Zoom) also have interesting side effects that allow Joe to interact with his environment, solve puzzles, and unlock secrets.  There's no reason to spoil any such challenges here, but let's just say that you'll be using your thinking caps on everything from opening doors to finding a boss' weak point.  And don't forget -- there is no shame in hitting up our friend, the IGN Guide, for some emergency tips.  And believe us, some gamers will definitely need them.  One of the best things about Viewtiful Joe is its extremely challenging gameplay.  We're talking about that NES-style of repeatedly continuing and replaying levels until your reflexes have become perfectly in synch with Joe himself.  Enemies will swarm you and grow in both size and difficulty as the game progresses, boss fights are never anything less than intense, and players who continue to pour their playtime into Viewtiful Joe will either pass out from the stress or feel more like a kung fu badass than ever before.  The game is definitely one of the most challenging action titles on the GameCube, and possibly for any other system in recent times.  Inexperienced players will still get a kick out of transforming into Viewtiful Joe during the opening level and beating the junk out of the first wave of baddies, but they'll need to buck-up if they hope to progress.  Viewtiful Joe will definitely put hair on any gamer's chest, and it might just make a man out of some kids yet.    The Bad If one were to find gripes to nitpick in Viewtiful Joe (as most can and will do with any game), then there are a few we could list here for the sake of completeness and objectivity.  Boss characters are wicked-cool, but the game could use a few more of them, as you'll sometimes fight the same boss at several points in the storyline instead of being treated to all new ones.  Also, VJ's story is not nearly as coherent as one might hope, as you'll often jump locations between episodes without any real explanation in the plot.  Such story gripes are a minor fuss, though, since it really exists only to justify the action any way it can.  After having played through a good part of the game, some IGN editors feel that, despite what the game packs in style and action, it lacks in providing an equal breakthrough in the technological or gameplay design arena.  Those of us VJ-addicts would also agree that the merits of this game are strongly rooted in its classic and extremely well-executed action, so if you're hoping for a brilliant leap forward in technology or design, then it's time to get your expectations in check.  Other gripes could be that the game is too difficult, or that the action becomes too repetitive throughout the lengthy adventure.  All of these points can be argued with some merit, but none are worth getting hung up on or spoiling the viewty that is Joe.  The Viewtiful Now that you've heard the Good and Bad that Viewtiful Joe has to offer, we'd like to take just a quick moment to drool all over ourselves and spew forth whatever remaining VJ fandom remains within. First, we must give crazy props to the mad scientists at Capcom for A) dreaming up this game, B) having the courage to greenlight it, and C) having the talent to pull it off so amazingly well.  In a time when action games are becoming more cookie-cutter and less challenging to give a wider, mass-market appeal, Viewtiful Joe slaps the industry in the face and dares to make games hard again while simultaneously returning the color pink to its throne of '80s coolness.  Both feats are something we'll gladly applaud.  You'll find pink in the least likely places, and you will love it. Another part of Viewtiful Joe that we fell in love with: its surprising length.  Just when you think it's over, it's not.  There are a total of seven episodes, so a hardcore gamer could possibly play through from start to finish in roughly seven hours, but most could spend twice that (if not longer) due to the time needed to die, continue, and replay some of the tougher spots.  And just when you thought a final boss fight couldn't possibly get any cooler, Viewtiful Joe's does.  Gamers will want to put in the extra effort to see Joe all the way through to the end, not only for the final gameplay experience, but also for the bonus treats you'll get in return -- they make the game worth playing all over again from scratch.   Graphics You can trust that Capcom isn't going to slap the name ~viewtiful~ on a box unless it's sporting impressive visuals to back it.  In the case of Viewtiful Joe, we're treated to a gorgeously rendered cel-shaded package that borders closer to the true definition of artwork than nearly any other game on the system.  Everything from the diverse and richly detailed backgrounds to the wildly unique character designs, the truly beautiful graphical effects, and the unbelievable character animations are all masterfully crafted, making Viewtiful Joe a showpiece title for Nintendo's console.  Not for a second does the game stutter or slow down.  It runs at a rock-solid framerate that shows off every brilliant frame of Joe flipping, twisting, soaring, posing, punching, and kicking with much style and convincing fluidity.  In fact, the artists and animators have injected so much life into this new Joe character that we could easily see him becoming the next big thing to hit a Saturday morning TV spot near you.  You better believe that we'd wake up early for it.  And, of course, techies will be glad to know that the game does, in fact, support progressive scan output for an even more impressive display -- if such a thing were even possible.  But there's no amount of words here that could justly describe the creative, offbeat style and talented craftsmanship that have blended so wonderfully to comprise Viewtiful Joe.  Instead, we highly recommend a simpler alternative: pick it up right now and appreciate the goodness for yourselves.  Sound Though lacking any real surround support, Viewtiful Joe's stereo mix is adequately crisp and varied.  At any single moment, there's a wide range of sound effects all hitting your speakers at the exact same time -- punches, shattering metal, echoes, chimes, cheers, voices, grunts, explosions, motors -- you name it, and VJ assaults your ear buds with it.  Some effects could use a bit more variety, but given the complete spread of simultaneous sounds the game must produce to keep up with the onscreen action, there's really little room for complaint.  Musically, VJ's beats are reminiscent of a funky trance rave where everyone's wearing pink and having a jammin'-good time.  The style of tunes is consistent throughout the game and gets appropriately dramatic whenever a good boss fight calls for it.  Otherwise, chances are good that you won't even notice the beats one way or the other as you focus instead on keeping Joe on his toes.  When Joe starts busting things up, crank those speakers. It's really exciting to see what happens when a big publisher such as Capcom grants its star game designer, Hideki Kamiya of Resident Evil 2 fame, a blank check.  Though Kamiya fans would never doubt his talents, even the creative mastermind himself once admitted to being nervous of the reception that his latest pet project, Viewtiful Joe, would receive by gamers.  With its eccentric style and old-school gameplay, would gamers be hooked?  Would they see past Joe's pink cape and realize that underneath lies a burger-eating, crime-fighting machine?  Thankfully, we've already seen the successful sales numbers roll in during Joe's mid-summer Japanese launch, and now we finally get to see how the long-awaited American launch will fare. I know I speak for many here at IGN when I say that I hope Viewtiful Joe sells through the roof here in the U.S.  It's one of the most action-packed and genuinely entertaining games I've played in a long time on any system, and it certainly deserves to serve Capcom proud.  If you're a fan of great action and side-scrolling beat-'em-ups, then run and get yourself a copy today while you still can.  If for some reason you still don't own a GameCube, then don't let that be your excuse -- take advantage of the latest $99 price-point and get to know Joe, pronto.It's hard to fault this game in any one particular area other than its slightly flat story, so don't even bother looking for another dull spot, 'cause most everything else has already been polished to perfection.  Graphics, gameplay, lasting appeal -- you name it, and Viewtiful Joe nails everything that truly makes a game fun.  If the intense challenge intimidates you, then good -- you could probably use a good ass kicking, anyway.  I know I certainly did.  Beating this game is a badge of honor to wear with pride, and you can bet that I'll be playing through Viewtiful Joe several more times to see if I'm still man enough to call myself a gamer.", "date": "Oct 3, 2003"}
