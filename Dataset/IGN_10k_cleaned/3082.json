Today, those shows have been replaced by the likes of Rocket Power, Rugrats, and The Wild Thornberrys, just to name a few.  Now that Nickelodeon has all these great franchises to work with, what's the first that they do?  They release a party game, featuring characters from several of its television shows!  Features  Multi-event party game starring Nickelodeon characters Five game types with multiple levels, themes, and bosses Interactive environments, objects, and hazards, all based on Nickelodeon shows  Extras including collectables, mini-games, and power-ups Up to four players simultaneously  Un-Gameplay Nickelodeon Party Blast is the latest party game based on successful franchises.  But rather than Mario, Sonic, Shrek, or Rayman characters, we now have Spongebob Squarepants, Jimmy Neutron, Invader Zim, Otto and Reggie Rocket (Rocket Power), Angelica and Tommy Pickles (Rugrats), and Eliza Thornberry (The Wild Thornberrys), all characters from popular Nickelodeon cartoons.    The types of party games included in the game sound decent, but play out horribly.  For example, one game has you and three other players in a kitchen having a food fight.  The goal is to stay the cleanest by throwing food at the other players and dodging their attacks.  It's too bad you can barely control the action.  Aiming is nonexistent and determining what you can pick up is more than a chore.  You may actually score better by putting in Halo and playing a few levels.  The other games are easily as bad.  Let's talk about the basketball game.  All the players are on rollerblades, skating around an arena that is half basketball court, half skatepark.  The goal is simple enough: get the ball in the hoop. You can also ~grind~ around the level for extra points.  First off, this concept of grinding and doing tricks while trying to throw a ball into a hoop is a little off.  Should I go skate the half-pipe in the back or throw the beach ball through hoop?  Or should I throw the ball into the hockey goal in the arena?  What's that hockey goal doing here anyways?  Wait, I just got 300 points for throwing the beach ball in the hockey goal!  How come I'm stuck to a giant meatball?  I've already lost myself...  Multi-player only makes things worse.  With everyone not knowing what to do, all hope of getting something done is lost forever.  The game might provide a few moments of entertainment as your intelligence steadily corrodes and you forget exactly what game you're playing, but other than that, invite your friends only if you're looking to be alone.  FOR ALL ETERNITY.    Controlling all characters feels plain bad.  Floaty and unresponsive, you may find yourself wondering what exactly it is that you are doing.  A made-up physics model and detestable level design only add to the frustration of trying to accomplish a certain goal.  I think I'll go home and play my TI-85 calculator.    Exactly what this game is. De-Graphics Y'know how a lot of Nickelodeon shows have a unique art style to them?  They all look like nothing on any other channel, but strangely similar to themselves.  Well, you could say this game also has a unique graphical style.  It's called, sucks.  It doesn't look like many other games, and it does look horrible within itself.  It's bright and colorful, but everything just looks generic and simple.  There are level themes from the different Nick shows, but unless someone told me, I would've never known.   Whenever you have four characters on the screen moving around, there is also slowdown.  Why, I'm not sure, since this game is in no way utilizing the Xbox's power.  There's just not that much going on to warrant any hint of slowdown.  The game is also full of bad effects, low-polygon levels, and poor animation.  Yuck. Anti-Sound If there's something that's worse than the graphics, it's got to be the sound.  We're talking pots and pans quality here.  The level music must have been ripped-off a 1970's album titled Game Music.  Fortunately, the music volume is turned low in the mix.  Things could get ugly if someone were to overhear you playing this game.        The in-game sound effects are just dreadful too.  Ripped from the same album the music was, the effects sound weak and plain.  If you were to hear them without seeing what was going on onscreen, you'd have a tough time knowing what the sounds were representing.  Yes, it's that bad.  With so many great franchises, this could've been a decent party game.  Instead, what we're left with is a poor-looking, poor-sounding, and poor-playing game.  I don't think I could even recommend this to the age range that this game is aimed towards.  Those kids may never want to play games again after playing this, and I'd hate to do that to anyone.  Like the name implies, this game is only (barely) worth a spare nickel for price of admission.  I've already said too much...", "date": "Oct 21, 2002"}
