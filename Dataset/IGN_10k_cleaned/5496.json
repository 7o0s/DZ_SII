Grand Theft Auto continues to spawn imitators on the consoles just as Pokemon is the king of copycats in the realm of handhelds. Since Pikachu's introduction there has been a continuous supply of games boasting tournaments, collection quests, and the ~gotta catch'em all~ style of gameplay. Shaman King is the latest Pokemon clone to hit the shelves but in this version you acquire souls instead of monsters. Don't worry, it still features a young male protagonist, creatures that evolve and combine, and of course, it's very own cartoon series. Expect action figures, trading cards, and a breakfast cereal to follow.   Gamers take on the role of Yoh a young Shaman who collects spirits in order to become the Shaman King and save the world. Staying true to the formula, the souls you collect will start out with limited skills and you must summon them in battle to gain experience which in turn increases their level, health, and range of attack abilities. Early in the game Yoh meets a kindred soul named Amidamaru who is not only the most powerful member of the team, but a good friend - think Pikachu. Of course Yoh Asakura isn't the only Shaman on the block. As the fabled tournament draws closer, all sorts of tormented spirits and evil shamans start to appear. Soon, Yoh is joined by a cowardly friend, a brutal trainer, and an assortment of fans that grow along with his skills. Battles have you assemble a team of up to six spirits and summon them against rivals for one-on-one ghostly duels. Each spirit has a list of techniques that inflict damage along with an occasional status effect like sleep, or poison. Each attack is also associated with an elemental property. According to the instruction manual these elements are complexly related and determine the effectiveness of an attack. It sounds like the makings for some deep strategy, however no further explanation is given as to what element will prevail in a face off. This leaves the player to launch a series of trial attacks until one of them has an ~amazing effect.~ A tighter focus on the elemental system would have added another facet to battles that are often decided by which spirit has the more hit points. Besides trading blows, spirits can also use items to restore health, cure status effects, and trap spirits without the hassle of a battle. That's right, Shaman King even has its own version of the Pokeball called a Mortuary Tablet. I never failed to capture a spirit by simply defeating it in battle, so the usefulness of the Mortuary tablet is questionable. If any of the random battles prove too difficult, players can always use the ~flee~ command and be guaranteed a safe escape. Combine this with an easily accessible save point that restores all health and the game is completely devoid of a challenge.    There is an option to change spirits in the middle of a battle which forfeits a turn. If a soul's attack and defense is high enough to outlast the competition, you can simply mash the A button until the enemy is out of health. If you focus on raising Amidamaru's skills early in the game, he easily beats wave after wave of enemy spirits. Even changing team members eventually becomes useless.     There are a few ways to start a spirit duel in Shaman King. The most common encounters are random battles with spirits that populate the various locations on the map screen. Many gamers find random battles to be frustrating or annoying and Shaman King does little to side step this issue. The random occurrence of a battle is so frequent that you may encounter four or five angry spirits in the time it takes you to walk across the GBA screen. The map locations are not very large but the rate of battles more than compensates for the limited space. After suffering a string of incessant attacks as I tried navigate Yoh the ten steps needed to reach the exit of an area I simply shut the game off and decided to start back at my last save. Luckily there are also story driven events that pit Yoh against other shamans who have their own assortment of spirits. These battles involve a series of enemy spirits and may force you to rely on using team members other than the powerful Amidamaru. Yoh's  fianc and teacher also summons spirits that are visible on the map screen for a series of training events. These enemies either appear as characters or small blue flames that can be attacked at will. Depicting all enemies in this fashion would have been a major improvement.  To say that Shaman King is a strange game would be an understatement. Most collection games have a very loose basis in reality, but this one reaches new levels of oddness with its assortment of wacky characters. There are some references to Japanese folklore in its depiction of ghosts and spirits and the instructional manual explains that the origin of the Shaman's power originated with the Aztec civilization in Central America. However, the game never ventures to offer an explanation for why the main town is filled with the angry spirits of sales clerks and small mammals. Fighting the wayward spirit of a disgruntled movie critic makes me long for the more logical battles between mutated monsters summoned from playing cards. Yoh is limited to the number of spirits he can carry with him but he has the option drop or combine them to free up space in his inventory. Unfortunately the system for joining spirits is completely arbitrary. The resulting spirit might have similar battle statistics but there is no explanation for why the soul of a cat mixed with a mole creates the ghost of a chameleon. There are even more outlandish results when mixing the souls of karaoke singers and household pets. Combining members of a collection would be far more interesting if there were some rhyme or reason to the resulting spirits.  On the up side, Spirit King has a pleasing art style that combines comical character art with detailed environments. The battle screens are a bit sparse, with animation limited to a character portrait shaking and flashing in response to an attack. Probably the most enjoyable aspect of the game is the dialogue. Yoh's conversations with his friends and enemies are worth a few chuckles. The lighthearted banter is entertaining enough to make sections of the ridiculous plot enjoyable. When copying a popular style of game play there is the opportunity to improve upon the original idea with modifications and additions. Shaman King is not only a clone of  another game but it fails to come close to the standard set by the Pokemon series. If you have played every monster, capsule, and card game on the market and still crave a Pokemon style RPG, Shaman King might provide some enjoyment. Otherwise, there's no reason to settle for this level of quality in such a crowded genre.
