While the fighting games themselves have been steadily progressing (MK4 is now 3D), Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub Zero, an action/adventure title based on the franchise, is a step backwards.   Mythologies is a prequel to the fighting games, offering a back story for Sub Zero, one of the most popular characters from Mortal Kombat. This in itself is a pretty good idea. Not only does it extend the life of the series, it offers gamers a new look at Sub Zero. However, the game itself is so flawed as to render all good intentions null and void.   While not necessarily a problem in itself, the fact that the game is in 2D causes all sorts of problems for the game, both in graphics and control. The look of the game is decidedly retro - all the characters are digitized and their movement is stiff. Since the player spends the whole game watching Sub Zero walk left or right, it would be nice if he had more life-like movements. As it is, it1s like watching a mannequin being wheeled across a stage.   The biggest problem with the game, and what ultimately makes it so frustrating, is the control. Let's face it, control is the singlemost important part of any game, and when you1ve got fighting and platform jumping to do, it1s doubly so. In this game, the player is required to hold lots of buttons down to do basic things like run and jump, which makes it nigh on impossible to make it across any chasm. Also, to turn left or right, you have to press a shoulder button. The lag time between press and action is very long, and by the time you1ve turned to face your opponent, he1s already jumped back over your head.    Bosses are way too tough and the basic enemies all look the same. Even with the RPG elements and FMV, the game is just no fun. Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub Zero may have been a good idea on paper, but as a game it1s terrible.", "date": "Oct 2, 1997"}
