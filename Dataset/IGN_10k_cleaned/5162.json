I've been playing Shade: Wrath of Angels and I'm completely ready to be done with it. This is just one of the most annoyingly frustrating and banal action/adventure games I've played in quite some time. Why anyone would want to spend a hard earned $40 on a game like this is a mystery I'll be pondering for exactly as long as it takes me to finish writing this review. Simply put, Shade is plagued with a terribly frustrating combat system, a story that, mysterious as it is, never caught my attention, a main character that you could flush down a drain and never miss, and enemies that I've seen in a billion other games used in a billion more interesting ways.   First things first. If you already have Shade, or are planning on purchasing it regardless of my rantings, you should go and download the patch. While it's not a magical ~this file will make this game good~ patch, it does make it better, solving some issues with the physics and some weird graphical glitches. As it was, killing enemies would cause them to fall through the floor into some mysterious underland or even stretch off in ridiculous fashion before disappearing into the ground. Now bodies, including your own (quite often), will fall to the floor with some bit of realism. Those of you that don't have an Internet connection on whatever computer you're playing the game are out of luck. It's a pretty huge damn bug to ship a game with.   Now that's out of the way... Shade: Wrath of Angels is about fantasy. It's a fantasy that probably could have been cool, but is just too unintelligible and horribly written to be anything but awkward and confusing. The beginning scene shows an archeologist writing a letter to his brother (the main character) telling of a discovery he's made that's incredibly important. And, like all professionals would, he invites his hardcore badass brother (the player character) down to help protect the secret, only when said brother arrives, nothing is as it should be. Soon enough, badass brother is confronted by a ghostly angel saying that archeologist brother is trapped and has to be saved, which can only happen should she and her angel friends be freed as well. Badass brother then goes on a quest to save archeologist brother. The funny part about the whole thing is that badass brother never seems to be surprised or upset in the slightest, even at the appearance of the angel and subsequent transportation to a realm where he needs to use a glowing sword to fight skeletons.      Now, by itself, the premise is a little bland, but it could have been serviceable in the right hands. But when you tack on some terrible writing, hokey voice acting, a main character that's about as boring as I've seen in recent years, and a plot that characters don't really seem to react to, it's not fun.    If that were the least of Shade's worries, I might have been in a more forgiving mood, but unfortunately, that's just where they begin. Heck there are some games with trite stories that I enjoyed quite a bit because of the gameplay. Far Cry, while in a different genre and a completely different game, comes to mind. Fairly normal story, great game. Shade's gameplay is not great.   Shade is a game I'd categorize as an action/adventure game. You search around fairly linear levels for stuff to solve fairly basic puzzle elements, jump across chasms in frustrating platforming elements, and kill things using firearms, medieval weapons, and magical powers. None of these areas are particularly done with any kind of style or grace.   Combat is especially disappointing. When playing a game like this, you want to have responsive controls and feel like a hero. All I felt was like a bumbling idiot, which made me feel normal. I don't like feeling normal in video games, I play them to feel like a super agent and do things that I couldn't do in normal life. I'd like to be able to circle around an enemy while locking onto them. I'd like to be able to see some sort of contact be made with the enemy that registers and maybe even stuns them. I'd like to feel like I can string attacks together consistently. But when the using the same combination of keys to attack performs three different maneuvers randomly, I can never know what I'm doing and therefore never really time attacks to where I feel like anything but a klutz.    Winning a fight is pretty easy when there is only one enemy on screen, degrading to a contest of timing blocks and attacks, but when more than one enemy pops up, there's a good chance you're in a world of hurt. Not only are they super aggressive and can seemingly break any combination and attack faster than you, but they'll circle around behind you and chop you down from the back. You're supposed to be able to attack in one direction and then another, like Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time allowed, but good luck getting that to work consistently. The controls are just too unresponsive. It sucks feeling like your character popped one too many valium's before heading off on this grand adventure.   I think part of the problem are the animation sets that are clunky enough to erase any fluidity of motion or grace from the main character's actions. Whether it's attacking an enemy or jumping onto a ledge, the transitions are terrible.    Now, you do have the option to use firearms, but for some dumb reason, you can't move while shooting. It makes shooting a dangerous proposition while increasing aggravation levels and slowing down the combat.   Finally, the character also has the option to transform into a demon. You'd figure this would be an exciting process and would allow for some strategy and fun times in combat. But if you figured that, you'd figure wrong. It's a normal sized, lumbering demon that is more useful for pushing and pulling large blocks of stone around. Whooptie-F'ing-doo. If you're going to have the main character be able to turn into a demon, that thing better be able to rip the crap out of anything that stands in his way. I want gallons of blood. I want skeletons shattered. I want brutality. I don't want weak magic, sad melee, and speed that rivals a napping tortoise.    One of the major problems dealing with this annoying combat and almost as annoying platform elements is the lack of a quicksave function. The save stations and healing cracks (yes, there are little cracks on the ground full of healing light) are too few and far between     Visually, aside from the animations, Shade isn't an ugly game, but it's certainly not going to win any awards. Technically the game is pretty decent, but artistically... well, it's starving for imagination. Everything is just plain dull! I've seen all of this about a thousand times before and done better in many cases. This kind of dark and dank just isn't attractive, interesting, or scary. It's boring.   The only really redeeming quality that I can find in Shade is the music. The score added is actually pretty decent, surprising considering the quality of nearly every other aspect of the game.As I said before, Shade: Wrath of Angels, is not a good game. It's not a game that I would recommend to anyone. I would recommend Blade of Darkness or even the lackluster Rune, both of which are years old, over Shade in an instant. It's like the developers didn't take the time to look at comparable games and really figure out what made them work, what made them interesting, and most importantly what made them fun.", "date": "Oct 25, 2004"}
