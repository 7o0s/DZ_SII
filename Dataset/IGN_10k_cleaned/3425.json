{"name": "Pride FC: Fighting Championships", "name_review": "Pride FC", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/02/07/pride-fc-2", "text": "When somebody uses the phrase ~mixed martial arts~, there's a huge contingent of American's that stare blankly at the speaker who said it. A budding sport in every sense of the word, no-holds barred fighting is still met with slow success here in America while it continues to explode in other countries. Thailand, Brazil, and Japan, however, have seen a huge emergence of mixed-martial arts popularity over the last couple of years, with one elite organization in particular standing far above the rest. Known as the Pride Fighting Championships, this organizations is the end-all, be-all of professional human combat, and for those of us who follow it, is one of the greatest spectacles currently running.   Housed exclusively in Japan via sold out pay-per-view events and siphoned to the Americas through DirecTV and Dream Stage DVDs, Pride FC is still searching for a larger western audience. Originally released in videogame form in the Land of the Rising Sun from the folks at Capcom, the first and only Anchor-developed Pride simulator has done moderately well now looking to get a little piece of that action themselves). With almost 20 DVDs flying off the shelves here in the United States and more on the way, THQ couldn't have planned for a better time than now to finally unveil its oft-delayed port of the Nippon success. And while it's certainly rough around the edges with plenty of improvements to be made in future versions, Pride FC is one hell of a decent fight simulator.   Gameplay  As some of you may remember, Anchor Inc. developed the first Ultimate Fighting Championship for Sega's Dreamcast nearly three years ago. An unheard of accomplishment at the time, the technically sound and beautifully rendered fighter still stands today as one of the top 3D battlers in that console's short existence. After quite a few sequels developed by other programmers and many revolutions later, the originators have returned with a better grasp of the genre and plenty of ideas to go with it.    If you've never played UFC or the Pride demo that's been floating around before, it's best described as a more grounded interpretation of Tekken. Left and right punch is manipulated through the Square and Triangle button while right and left kicks are performed via Circle and X. By default, the shoulder buttons do nothing, but just like Tekken they can be programmed to expound certain maneuvers or button combinations for the mechanically challenged, while pushing two lefts or two rights together is how one grapples. Pushing in the direction that your character's back is faced is how one defends, while pressing both punch buttons or both kicks will counter an opponent's attack at high and low intervals respectively. The whole system is extremely intuitive, and for players who have busted their chops with Namco sluggers of previous UFC games, this shouldn't be a problem to get the hang of all.   What makes the engine so beautiful, however, is how flexible it is regardless of your position. Though each match will begin in the stand-up mold with two fighters facing each other, the battles can go anywhere from there. Opposing fighters can knock each other down and rain strikes upon their backside foe with downward punches and strikes, or jump on top of them for an impromptu wrestling match and battle of submissions. It is from this position that the game is mostly played, and just like the real Pride events held in Japan, can last several rounds and minutes or be over in just a few seconds.    It's that aspect of the mechanics that serve as both the game's strength and what could be perceived as its weakness. To its credit, players who have been pummeled to death for the entire fight always have a chance to come back and gain victory if they can time their counter or reversal well enough to catch their opponent unaware. On the other hand, it seems as though these sudden holds or reversals can be broken or maintained with nothing more than a stroke of luck. Or at least, that's how it appears during your first couple of playthroughs.   The truth is that the game is unbelievably sensitive when it comes to timing. Press the buttons too fast or not quickly enough, and your opponent's grapple will most likely tap you out faster than you can say ~ankle lock.~ The same truth chimes in when starting your defensive move too early or too late as well. Pride FC is a game that's all about patience, even in it's most hectic of moments, and when somebody panics and starts pressing buttons randomly chances are they're going to lose. The action may seem random or contrived at first, but believe me, it isn't.   As good and reactive as this engine is, I can't help but wonder why it hasn't picked up on a feature that wrestling games have had for years and that the upcoming Konami mixed-martial arts game K-1 World Grand Prix boasts as well. That is, specific limb damage. As an avid fan and amateur street fighter/Jiu Jitsu practitioner myself, I know as well as anybody that wearing down a specific limb or joint is to your advantage. Could anyone forget the classic battle between Royce Gracie and Kazushi Sakuraba at the Pride Grand Prix? Over 90 brutal minutes of fighting, Sakuraba pounded on the legs, hips, and shins of Gracie until the popular Brazilian could take no more. He could barely walk before throwing in the towel disgraced, and this is a feature that definitely should have made it into Pride FC.    Another missed opportunity lies in the execution of the grapples. In games like King of Coliseum, WWE Smackdown, and other such games, pressing different directions on the digital pad results in different kinds of moves, in Pride FC only your position determines the maneuver, not the command you input in your controller. And while some will argue that that's how real fighting is, I'm inclined to disagree. Should you have one player drop guard for instance, and another position himself for the mount, he should be given more choices and opportunities than going for the top position. In real life, a side mount is far more effective and weaseling your way through a full guard to a half guard is a great way to tire out your opponent and expose his body parts. All I propose is, let the gamer decide what strategy he wants to use. Rather than automatically set him up for a top mount, why not let him take his chance and go for the side? Should he fail, his opponent should have the opportunity to counter or reverse with a maneuver of his own, and so on.   Alas, this review is ultimately about what is, and not what should be. Luckily Pride has plenty of positive things going for it. Despite the limitations on grappling and positioning, there are enough positions and grapples per spot to give even the most astute learners a hefty dose of memorization. And to make things even more interesting, no two fighters play the same. You'll literally need a different strategy to play as and fight against each one of them. Strikers, grapplers, freestyle fighters, and wrestlers are only a few of the different types of foes you'll encounter, and unless you're extremely good, beating them all consistently will prove to be a real problem (especially on the hard modes). I like it.    Features  Not the biggest option set in the world, Pride FC's feature set hovers on the small side. It's most spectacular section is probably the Grand Prix mode with which you can recreate your own tournament with 16 human or CPU players. Based on the same ladder that crowned Mark Coleman the first Grand Prix Champion in the year 2000, the tournament mode is a quick fun way to see an ending, get some credits, and hone your skills.   Rounding out the selection there's a decent training mode (that I wished had a ~challenge~ switch that you could turn on and off like DOA3), a tough as nails survival competition, an exhibition match, Fighter biographies and history sections, and a super cool create-a-character feature that lets you go all out to make the fighter of your dreams. And though the character builder isn't as detailed as THQ's other grappling game, WWE Smackdown, it's move list editor is pretty damn impressive. As not only can you teach your fighter any hold from any fighting discipline within the entire roster, you can also build your own chain moves and combinations with the comprehensive damage tree that tells you what you can link, what you can't, and what can stun your opponents half-way through. I hope more videogame designers pick up on this idea in the future; it's a good one.   One oversight that I couldn't believe, however, was the developers not including some kind of career mode. With 25 fighters and a comprehensive create-a-character option, it's amazing to me that advancing someone's career or winning and defending a title wasn't possible. In today's day and age of boxing and wrestling game career modes, major sports franchise seasons, and light experience point systems in Pride's competitor UFC Throwdown, this lack of depth really takes away from the single-player gaming experience. Not having any secret or unlockable characters or features isn't very cool either.    Graphics  ~You win some you lose some~ as the old saying goes, and Pride FC is no exception. Boasting some excellent idle and fighting animations in addition to a slew of character-specific mannerisms, Pride is definitely the most personal of all fighting simulators. Worlds above the pretty but lifeless models of Crave's UFC title, each and every contestant looks and reacts like he's supposed to. Vanderlei Silva rolls his fists together before every match, Royce Gracie arrogantly stares at his opponent before raising his hand in recognition, and Kazushi Sakuraba stands in the same relaxed, hands-down stance we've come to respect him for.   Of course, the textures on the fighters themselves leave a lot to be desired. Granted, the heads and faces of each fighter are marvelously done, but their body maps don't fare nearly as well. Take the Big Cat Tom Erikson for instance. A naturally hairy guy, Erikson's growth on his chest looks more like gobs of dark brown spaghetti than the remnants of puberty. Other bodily features like tattoos and zonky hairstyles are a bit out of place when compared to the models as well, and the sometimes-excessive blood that covers the canvas and camera lens looks more like polka dots rather than hemoglobin.   The fighter introductions, on the other hand, look absolutely spectacular. Step for step identical to the real walks made by the athletes of mixed martial arts, each and every march is meticulously recreated to mirror that of their real life counterpart. From the smoke and lighting effects to the pyrotechnic displays, Anchor has nailed the intros big time.    Sound  Pride FC does a great job of capturing the sounds of the big event. Crowds react at the proper moment, the referee prepares the judges before each match, and the ring trembles with plenty of foot thunder. Character introductory songs in particular stand out as marvelous recreations of the real thing, as every last player is treated to their real-life musical theme. My personal favorite is Igor Vovchanchyn's, whose icy cold anthem serves as the total embodiment of his personality.   Unfortunately, there's no voice in the game at all with the exception of noise before each fight. And while I don't usually miss those sorts of things in my boxing or wrestling titles, it hurts the game quite a bit in this instance. The English-version broadcast team for Pride FC (Stephen Quadros and Bas Ruten) do an excellent job of commentating during the real events and their expertise would have come in handy during the action. I know what a Kimura and Triangle Choke is for sure, but how about Joe Average who's trying to understand what's going on? Anchor missed the boat on that one.   Also missing is any type of forward-thinking audio support. Though it's presented in standard stereo and sounds pretty good for the most part, it was a tad disappointing to hook it up to my surround system and hear nothing more than three of my speakers churning out the bone-crunching body noise. And it wasn't my configuration -- I checked. Technical shortcomings aside, the Japanese/American announcer duo that introduce fighters before each bout almost entirely make up for it.Despite my various nitpicks throughout the review, Pride FC is still a very playable and enjoyable game. Particularly entertaining when battling it out against other human players with the health bars turned off (defense becomes a lot more important!), Anchor's fight simulator achieves exactly what it wanted to: the recreation of Pride as a competitive sport. Though I can't imagine anyone really going after this one unless they're die-hard mixed-martial arts enthusiasts or fighting game fans.That said, I do hope the game sells well enough to warrant a sequel. If you throw in a couple of hidden goodies, bolster the lineup to include recent and past Pride legends like Mark Kerr, Hammer Coleman, and Bob Sapp, while fleshing out and creating the much-needed career mode and adding the ability to alter attacks on the fly, you could easily have yourself one of the greatest fighting sports titles ever made. Meanwhile, the Pride videogame we do have is still pretty good, we're just left wanting more. Here's to hoping!", "date": "Feb 7, 2003"}
