Chronicles is billed as a screen entertainment package and not really sure what the term meant, I approached the package as a game. Upon first loading, the player (or user if you prefer) finds himself confronted with Jaruu -- a character that appears to be a cross between Pikachu and an Ewok. ~Hi there!~ he says, ~I haven't seen you around here before. Let me show you around.~ The friendly little chap then walked around the room and jumped up on a bed. ~This is my bedroom. You could probably tell that from the bed.~ He has a sense of humor as well. Jaruu then proceeded to show me around his bedroom and the lounge room then told me ~You can check out the rest of the house by yourself.~  Creator John Passfield has adapted the term Soap Opera to Screen Opera to describe how he sees the appeal of Chronicles. Passfield and co-creator Steve Stamatiadis are the core of small Australian developer GeeWhiz!, who created the original 2D platform classic Halloween Harry and the upcoming 3D release Mike Stewart ProBodyBoarding. They began creating Chronicles as a weekend project 18 months ago with inspiration from Little Computer People. For those not familiar with LCP it was a little program that ran on the Commodore64 and Apple IIe. The user had to make sure the little character was fed and happy -- the original Tamagotchi.  Chronicles is set on the island of Bloofen Jut and, as such, you are restricted to exploring Jaruu's house and his large garden outside. My natural gamer's reaction was to grab the mouse and keyboard and start running around FPS style -- it didn't work quite like that. The keyboard is used to move around, while the mouse moves an arrow around the viewing area in a similar fashion to an adventure game. The arrow flashes the names of objects that can be clicked on and viewed up close. There is also a list of characters at the top of the screen with which you can jump straight to, wherever they are in the little world.  At this stage I walked up to Jaruu at his computer and tried out his basic conversation skills. When you are near a character you can attempt a conversation by typing simple phrases.  We seized on the opportunity and are pleased to bring you an exclusive IGNPC Interview with Jaruu Tenk.  IGNPC:Hi. My name is Arun. Jaruu: Arun. That's a cool name... IGNPC:Well, I am cool. Jaruu: Funny that you say that... IGNPC:How are you ? Jaruu: I'm keeping busy. IGNPC:What are you doing ? Jaruu: I'm writing a report. IGNPC:Why? Jaruu: That's really none of your business Arun. IGNPC: That was rude.  Shut up. Jaruu: Hey, you're the one that started asking the stupid questions... IGNPC: Yeah, OK then @#$% you! Jaruu: You really need some manners.  As it turns out Jaruu has nothing that revealing to say in conversation with so many hmmm's, oh's and uh-huh's you'll wonder if perhaps Jaruu was dropped on his head too many times as a baby, uh, whatever he is. While Chronicles had a few cute little features, after a little more time spent exploring the house and the garden I was ready to categorize the title away as a children's only title.  I had however, installed Chronicles as my screensaver, and I soon learned this is where the product really was able to shine. I had actually forgotten that the title was installed so when it fired up when I was working late I glanced up to see what was happening.  Jaruu was sleeping away on his bed and a few seconds later he stirred and woke up. ~Oh it's you. You're visiting late tonight. Now that I'm up I'll do a bit of work on Trundle.~ He then went over to a desk in his room and started working on his robot pal Trundle, who was sitting in bits.  Over the next few days, more of Jaruu's life was revealed to me. Grampa and cousin Freedy dropped by to have a chat and a wander around. For the most part though, Jaruu would just go about his daily life: writing reports, checking a leak in the water tank, working on Trundle, eating and sleeping. At one point he opened a room I had never seen before, took a seat in a strange bucket seat, turned to me and said ~Do you mind, I'm using the bathroom.~ The door promptly slammed shut. A funny touch I noticed later was when Grampa repeated the scene, then left the bathroom, paused and then decided he hadn't quite finished and returned to the bathroom. A few days later, Chronicles fired up one afternoon and Jaruu promptly greeted me, ~Hi there Arun. I haven't seen you around for a while. Earlier this morning I finished fixing Trundle. He should be around here somewhere.~ It is these little touches and the unfolding story that soon have you quite interested in this little package.  Graphically, Chronicles is not going to compete with the Unreal engine. That said, the characters are all quite interesting to look at, there are some nice lighting effects and it will run happily on a very wide base of systems. The style is reminiscent of console titles such as Mario64, Zelda: Ocarina of Time or Croc and seems very appropriate for a title like this. Similar to Zelda, Chronicles also features a day - night cycle, with different creatures that only appear at night. Unlike Zelda though, days in the world of Chronicles elapse in real time and day and night are dependent on your system clock.  While you can probably tell I have quite enjoyed having Chronicles of Jaruu Tenk on my system, passing a final verdict on Chronicles is rather difficult when looking at it from a gamers perspective. Youngsters will no doubt be attracted to the graphical style, talking with the characters, reading the various journals lying around the house and generally exploring. The more serious gamer may still find it a nice addition to their library, but it certainly doesn't rank up their with Homeworld or Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver. Anyone working in an office may also find it a nice distraction to have your little friend Jaruu pop up a couple of times a day.  Of course, your boss may fire you, but what're ya' gonna do? Either way, Chronicles is the best screensaver I have ever used with the ability to jump into interactive mode now and then to catch up on the details. With the promise of future updates with new characters, I will be keeping the little critter on my system for the long term.  Currently The Chronicle of Jaruu Tenk is only available as a direct download for $19.95 directly from Gee Whiz!.  It's worth checking out, so why not head over there now?  -- Arun ~Rooney~ Devidas", "date": "Nov 18, 1999"}
