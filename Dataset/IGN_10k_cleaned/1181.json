The company jabs its finger towards Nintendo in blame, but we real gamers know the truth.  Acclaim's been slacking off when it comes to making good games in general.  What's the proof?  Take a look at what the PlayStation's got: Armorines, ECW Hardcore Revolution, Shadowman, South Park, Chef's Luv Shack, and other games I wouldn't touch unless you paid me.  Most of Acclaim's games for PlayStation are just poorly done ports from Nintendo 64.  Shadowman, for example, was an excellent game on N64.  What happened here?   It feels like Acclaim doesn't have a whole lot of love for Sony.  Given the worthless crap they've been making (and not just on PlayStation), it surely seems that way.  Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000 is even more of the same stuff that Acclaim's known for on PlayStation.  It's got some okay ideas for a fun game, but it doesn't work out well in the end.  Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000 has been done a hundred times.  This is your basic racer from head to toe.  Acclaim's ingenuity seems to deplete by the day.   Gameplay If you look beyond the bikes and dirt, what do you see?  The same game you've played before, minus the fun.  Here's the stuff you get: 15 tracks full of dirt, eight racers that go on the dirt, a few modes which try to make things interesting, and Jeremy McGrath.  Woo!  You can perform tricks, race in the time trials, go against a buddy, make your own tracks and racer, and even go up and down on the bodacious half-pipe!   Do I sound too enthused?  Forgive me, I'm just deluding myself with false excitement.  I can hardly contain myself.  This is the exact same stuff you get in every other racing game these days.  The point to Jeremy McGrath SuperCross 2000 is to go faster than the other racers and cross the finishing line before they do.  Yeah, it's been done.  I'd get a giggle out of it if someone strapped some chimps in motocross suits and sent em' off instead of smelly humans.  That'd be worth playing.  This, on the other hand, isn't.   The ~race~ mode has a few different ways to play.  You can race a single race against five other computer-controlled players or go against a friend in the normal Race mode.  The Series mode is like a championship.  You race multiple times in ~weeks~ to see who's the best of them all.  Will it be you?  In the time-trials, you go against a ghost and try to beat the best times.  The Custom Rider mode allows you to build a unique player, and the Freestyle mode lets you pull tricks in one of four areas.   If you race against computer-controlled guys, there is some noticeable slow-down that hacks and slashes at the gameplay.  It's a big annoyance that's only present in the Race and Series modes.  Tracks consist of lots and lots of dirt, and the only obstacles that get in your way are the signs at the sides of the courses, jumps, and even rugged bumps.  Some of the tracks are inside stadiums, while others are outside.  Even so, they are all very similar: dirt, jumps, lots of turns.   Turning isn't an easy thing.  The other racers seem to do it perfectly, while you just bash into the sides.  You can hit the breaks, but they don't always save your hide.  Where's the realism?  The AI of the other racers is simplistic, the animation is cheap, and you can slam into walls that don't even seem to be there.  Sometimes, when you crash into a wall at full-speed, it will do absolutely nothing.  Other walls, on the other hand, make you flip off of your bike if you so much as look at them funny.  I really don't understand why some walls are more potent at knocking you over than others.   The race itself isn't much of a blast.  It's easy to take the lead and stay there, unless something stupid happens to keep you back.  If a racer smacks into you, you both fly off your bikes and the others end up taking the lead.  If there's a jump, you can try to perform a trick.  Other than that, it's just a straightforward race to the finish.  No shortcuts, nothing.  The control is loose and feels off.  Is this supposed to mimic the actual thing?   If you take one of the top three positions at the end of a race (and it's damn near impossible not to), you get to see an ugly 'celebration' scene with the first, second, and third-place finishers.  And fireworks!  You'll be dazzled, you'll be wowed.  These are the best special effects I've ever seen.  Imagine me trying to keep a straight face as I say that.   The two-player mode is terrible.  The split-screen isn't horizontal like in most games -- it's vertical.  Why?!  You can barely see anything.  The two-player race is the exact same thing as the Race or Series modes, but instead of going against five others, you go against a friend and no one else.  Luckily, the slow-down's much less existent.  Unfortunately, the mode still sucks.  You can choose from any of the 16 tracks and the two CC classes.  Whoopity-doo.   The Freestyle mode is the best of 'em all.  Does it suck?  You bet.  You get to choose from these four locations: Crater, Ramps, Urbania, and the Half-Pipe.  No sir, you don't race here.  This is where you get to show off your smooth style and perform some nasty tricks.  Nasty is right.  The tricks you can perform are very limited and crude.  The Can Can, Cliffhanger, Recliner, and Scorpion are four of the special moves you can do while in mid-air.  The longer you hold them, the better score you receive.   In the Crater, there's a big (you guessed it) crater in the middle of the stage.  Several inclines are on either side of the hole, so you can jump over it and pull tricks.  The Ramps area has lots of ramps.  In Urbania, you're in a city-scape with even more jumps.  The half-pipe has a few different pipes to do jumps and tricks on.  In each area, you have two minutes to jump your heart out.  Jump high, do 'fancy' maneuvers, earn points.  At the end of the two minutes, your points are tallied.  It gets old fast.   In the Time Trials mode, you have a dance competition against Britney Spears and Sisqo.  Just kidding.  You race against your own times, and it sucks too.   The tracks you can race in are Houston, Tempe, Seattle, Indianapolis, Atlanta, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Dallas, Glen Helen, Motocross 338, Steel City, Washougal, Spring Creek, Red Bud, Budds Creek, and Broome - Tioga.  Jeremy McGrath himself lends his voice to give tips to gamers.  If you select some of the game's later courses, Mr. McGrath gives you information for how to take curves, jumps, and gives other help.   Naturally, Jeremy is a selectable racer in his own game.  The others you can use are Dowd, Albertyn, Button, Windham, Tortelli, Pastrana, and Ramsey.  Each has his own unique statistics.   The track-editor feature is downright bad.  It's simple to use, but it offers next to nothing.  You can build your own courses with over a dozen parts.  Despite that, most of the parts are similar, except for turns.  Once you've designed a track, you can save it (each track uses one block of memory) and load it up for use later.  It's a shame that you can't choose more interesting track parts or special textures.   Graphics Acclaim generally knows how to make a game look good.  The Turok series on Nintendo 64 has some of the system's best visuals.  Even Forsaken had sweet lighting effects.  Shadowman was gorgeous.  Each one of these three games showcased what the company could do, and I was impressed.  Acclaim's games on both Dreamcast and Nintendo 64 are sassy, for the most part.  They really know how to break out the big-time digital cosmetics.   And then there are the PlayStation games.  Acclaim just seems to slop together polygons and textures in a stinking heap of gabbledeguk when it comes to Sony.  With Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000, nothing is different.  The textures are gritty, the course designs are confusing, and the bike animations lack the realism they deserve.  Jeremy McGrath supposedly is the man behind the motion-captured animation in this game.  Is that a fact?  You could have fooled me, McGrath.   Let's not forget the poor framerate.  It's true that Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000 probably wouldn't be much of a better game if it constantly ran at 30 FPS.  It wouldn't be saved if it ran at 60 FPS.  No framerate improvement could pull it out of the ditch it's in.  But still, Acclaim could have made an effort.   Sound This is the game's best feature.  The engine noises sound like crap, the crashes are average, and the announcer has plenty to say. The music, though, is especially good.  Acclaim got smart here.  The guys at Iguana West looked outside of their own company to license music from the Offspring.  Now, I'm no Offspring fan, myself.  ~Give it to me, Baby~ was overplayed to hell and back last year on the radio.  Besides that, people always try to convince me that Offspring is punk when it is so clearly not.  NOFX, Guttermouth, now that stuff's punk music.  Regardless, I'd be lying if I said they don't make good tunes.  They do, and it sounds really good in the game.  Jeremy McGrath endorsed the game, did motion-captured animations, and helped with the design.  What's that mean?  Absolutely nothin'.  This is yet another bad port of a Nintendo 64 game, despite that the Nintendo 64 version shouldn't have been made in the first place.  Why bother bringing a game like this to the PlayStation when there's no vast improvements on its gameplay?  Acclaim, I know you guys can do better than this.  Knock off the crap and get to work on something worth playing, already!", "date": "Aug 22, 2000"}
