He slips, slides and skids anytime he tries to stop, often resulting in untimely death. Mario's boots were made for walking, because his soles have superior grip  but inferior lift. His jumps don't reach the heights of his taller, younger brother's, often resulting in untimely frustration. In the end, you're in for a challenge no matter which plumber twin you choose. You're always stuck dealing with their cramped, crippled shoes.Super Mario Bros. 2, in Japan, was the first game in which the two Mario twins exhibited unique styles of control. You could choose from the title screen to play as either Mario or Luigi, and your choice greatly influenced how you'd have to play each level  whether more traditionally with the man in red, or more expertly with the guy in green. The new distinction between the brothers was just one of the additions made to make this sequel more of a challenge. It's just a shame that it was a sequel we in America never saw.Because Super Mario Bros. 2, for us, was a completely different game  a retrofitted version of a title called Doki Doki Panic, passed off as a Mario platformer because NOA thought the real Mario 2 was just too tough. Too much of a challenge. Americans couldn't handle it. And though modified versions of the game have made the trip across the Pacific in the past through titles like Super Mario All-Stars and Super Mario Bros. DX, the original Super Mario Bros. sequel has never been made available here in its untouched, 8-bit form. Until now. As Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels. It's an appropriate name for the game, because The Lost Levels plays more like an expansion pack to the first Super Mario adventure, and not so much like a complete follow-up. It's still a side-scrolling, platformer action game. You still gather Mushrooms to grow in size, and Fire Flowers to throw projectiles. You still find Invincibility Stars, hidden vines that stretch into the sky, and secret Warp Zones. And you're still trying to save the princess, who's still in another castle.So the option to play as the higher-jumping, looser-landing Luigi is the most major shift you'll see, as the rest of the game really does feel like an extra set of lost, additional levels added on to the end of Mario 1  challenge level included. The layout of platforms, bricks and pipes and the placement of enemies in The Lost Levels all pick up at about the same difficulty setting as the last few worlds in Super Mario Bros., and then get increasingly tougher after that. Skills that were secondary before become required here, as advancing through some of these stages involves precise jumping off of enemies' backs, scouting around open air for hidden coin blocks, and intentionally damaging yourself to return to smaller form.The Lost Levels are hard, and frustratingly so. You may begin to understand just why this game was denied American release on your fifteenth attempt to get Luigi to land properly on that one-block-wide platform while being assailed by the swarm of flying Cheep Cheeps and the one stray floating Blooper. But if you persist, and if you take advantage of the unlimited continues included here, you may be able to push through and reach the end.Which isn't the end. While you do save Princess Toadstool upon finishing a runthrough of World 8-4, Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels has a further 20 more stages to play through beyond that. The hidden World 9 can be accessed by completing the first eight worlds without using a Warp Zone, and the letter world A through D are earned after you conquer the main quest eight times over.A fairly popular trend on the Internet now is hacking old Mario games to make new levels, then challenging friends to try to beat the purposefully too-difficult designs. You can find videos of the subculture scattered on YouTube and similar sites, and watch as players try over and over to get through seemingly impossible side-scrolling challenges. Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels is a lot like that.Compared to the Mario we Americans know and love, The Lost Levels feels a lot like a fan-made hack  with platforming challenges that are just a bit too frustrating and don't flow as well as Mario 1, and graphics that seem like a downgrade as well. But, odd as it is, this is the real, actual follow-up to Super Mario Bros. the way it was intended to be. A set of 52 extra levels, all made harder than any found in the first SMB, and all spiced up with just enough new elements to make it stand alone as its own separate game. It's absolutely worth 600 of your Wii Points to experience it, and Luigi's alternate controls, and the near-maddening new vision of the Mushroom Kingdom for the very first time. Just prepare yourself for repeated trips to the Game Over screen, because it turns out that NOA made the right choice after all, over 20 years ago, in holding this one back.", "date": "Oct 4, 2007"}
