The game mirrors its console counterparts so well it's scary -- this is a remarkably complete game on a system full of half-baked ports.   If you can do it in the console game, there's a good chance you can pull it off in the N-Gage edition of Splinter Cell Chaos Theory. Sam Fisher's latest exploits send him around the world to thwart the effects of a nasty computer virus. Along the way, you'll have to make use of gadgetry like thermal vision, optic cables, and long-range scopes. Sam also has some new moves in play, too, such as a neck break that drops a terrorist like a sack of cold cuts.   In fact, Sam does a lot of killing in this outing. There is still plenty of sneaking in the shadows, avoiding detection by the terrorist organization's unending supply of guards (they obviously just completed a membership drive). However, thanks to the new knife, the easy-to-use targeting system, and the new lethal moves, Sam turns into a one-man army.   Of course, none of these new moves and techniques mean squat if the controls are off. Fortunately, Gameloft succeeds again here. Moving Sam around the levels is easy, thanks to the responsive game pad and the smartly mapped actions on the number keys. Drawing your weapon, lining up sniper shots, using hacking terminals -- everything just feels good.   What makes the game work so well is that Gameloft engineered it specifically for the N-Gage platform. This is not a ported Game Boy Advance game -- this is native. The architecture is smartly designed to take advantage of the vertical screen and the limited draw-in distance. The textures are some of the cleanest you've seen on the N-Gage. The animations are smooth -- watching Sam slip up behind a guard and slice his neck with one slight twist is an impressive sight.   Now, the game is not without a few minor issues. For one thing, the game is a lot more linear than its console cousins. There's really only one way through each level, and you can either do it cowboy-style completely or try to balance your aggressions with sneaking. But there's still just one real path. The camera, despite being under your control, isn't 100-percent friendly. You will get caught up on objects you cannot see because they are just out of the game's limited sight-line.   Splinter Cell Chaos Theory contains a very slick cooperative mode, playable over Bluetooth. Two players divide up the responsibilities of a super spy. One player is the action man, bearing the brunt of the physical tasks while the other is the team nerd -- the hacker. The competitive online mode for four players goes for the spies vs. mercs challenge that tore up Xbox Live before Halo 2 bowed. The mercs are given a first-person mode that you'll sometimes wish you could steal for the single-player campaign.  Splinter Cell Chaos Theory is easily one of the top three games for the N-Gage -- and it's probably the best of those three. Gameloft's attention to details specific to the platform pays off in spades -- games built from the ground up for a specific system just feel better. Better control, better level design, better graphics. And Splinter Cell Chaos Theory has all of these going for it, nevermind that's it's just a very compelling play. If you have an N-Gage and have just been itching to buy some MMC, make Splinter Cell Chaos Theory your top choice.", "date": "Jun 16, 2005"}
