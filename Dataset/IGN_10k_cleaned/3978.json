The now legendary Tomb Raider series which has been made popular by two Hollywood blockbusters, had its start on the PlayStation and PC back in 1996, and now in 2003, it will make its debut on the small screen as one of the premiere launch titles for Nokia's N-Gage game deck. Lara Croft was the first of many gaming heroines that embody the term ~big-guns~ in more ways than one. Although the buxom-badass-heroine is somewhat of a videogame  clich nowadays, Tomb Raider for N-Gage marks the first time any of them have looked so good and fit snugly in your pocket.FeaturesPlaystation classic turned N-Gage portableN-Gage Arena playOnline Shadow RacingSingle player gameImpressive portable 3D graphicsGameplayThose familiar with the original Tomb Raider will be treated to an impressive and faithful recreation with the N-Gage port. The basic design of the game is a mix of action, puzzles, and platforming (can we include T and A as a gameplay factor?), with a healthy dose of exploration. Level progression usually involves finding keys and switches to open new pathways, which is not entirely brilliant even by '96 standards, but still perpetuates an enjoyable exploration experience. The biggest problem most people will likely have with Tomb Raider is the controls. This is an issue that harkens back to the original version of the game, but has been slightly worsened by the N-Gage's button layout. While the Playstation version of the game allowed us the luxury of shoulder buttons, the N-Gage does not. Lara's numerous action commands are delegated solely to the right thumb. The N-Gage's raised five and seven buttons improve the situation slightly, since they are used for the more frequently accessed action commands, as well as serving as a locating point for your thumb. The outcome of your battles with enemies usually depends on the outcome of your battle with the controls. Lara's foes are the types that like getting up close and personal (who wouldn't with Lara), and skillful acrobatics are often the only means for successful evasion. Don't feel bad if your attempts at dodging enemies feel more like desperate and clumsy button-mashing as the learning curve for controlling Lara is steep. Traversing the game's countless ledges and deathtraps has also been made more difficult due to a strange auto-run implementation. Tapping up on the D-pad will make Lara run continuously, or until pressing down to stop her. We guess this was intended to put less stress on your thumb, but it ultimately makes it harder to navigate with precision, and demands more attention to the walk button (in which Lara moves like molasses. An option to toggle off auto-run is sorely missing.Tomb Raider will be one of the first titles to take advantage of the N-Gage Arena (Nokia's online gaming community). Accessing the Arena is a fairly simple process (considering your phone is already optimized for internet connectivity), and is immediately accessible from the game's main menu. Players can obtain tips and strategies, watch or upload movies of Lara in action, and compete in the surprisingly fun Shadow Racing option. This is where Tomb Raider fans from across the globe can race each other's recorded ghost data (a timed race through check points in game levels), to which the winner literally gets bragging rights.GraphicsTomb Raider is the perfect game to showcase the graphical power of the N-Gage. People unfamiliar with Nokia's new game system will be surprised to see that it comes very close to matching the visual output of the PlayStation One. Levels, while sporting primitive textures (as the Playstation version did), serve as the new benchmark for the 3D capabilities of a handheld. Lara looks nice and detailed as well; her animations are realistic, and aptly show off her physical attributes. She moves through her 3D environments at a slightly lower framerate than her PlayStation counterpart, but it's still smooth enough not to hamper Tomb Raider's gameplay too much. SoundTomb Raider's audio design is fairly simple, and consists largely of footsteps, gunshots, and enemy vocalizations. Background music is non-existent for the most part, save for occasional battle music, and short tunes that play when you find a key item. The lack of music accompanying Lara through the ancient ruins makes the experience feel a bit bland by today's standards. Sound samples are simple and do their job, but they fail to impress.Tomb Raider was a momentous game when it was released back in 1996, and seven years later as we revisit it as an N-Gage title Lara's age is beginning to show (mainly in its unintuitive controls and sluggish gameplay). While those accustomed to modern games with more refined controls may want to give Tomb Raider a thorough test before purchasing, fans of the original who want to relive the title in handheld form, and the more patient newcomers to the franchise (all three of you out there) will still enjoy this piece of gaming history gone portable.", "date": "Oct 4, 2003"}
