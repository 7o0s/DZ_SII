It streamlines the essence of the sport for easy, bite-sized consumption -- all of the checks, slapshots, and hits are indeed present, but without a convoluted control scheme that stands between you and them. If I'm starting the review with a little gushing, forgive me. After the dismal lock out last season that put a friend of mine into a severe funk, it's good to see the sport back on the ice -- and so well represented on my phone.   The game play is incredibly smooth. These little players truly glide across the ice at just the right clip. The action always feels furious, but never out-of-control. Via the d-pad, I was able to get the puck really moving up and down the rink, and the pass/shot commands are mapped to face buttons. The camera has been pulled back far enough to give you a nice view of the ice, showing well over a third of the rink. The players are small, but easily identifiable. And did I mention how well they zoom around the rink?   NHL 5-on-5 2006 offers multiple play modes, such as the quick play exhibition game that will get you right into the action before your bus even pulls away from the curb. The season mode is better suited for hockey fanatics, as you can follow your fave team through an entire 82-game season if so desired. NHL 5-on-5 2006 also includes play-offs, the All-Star Game, and the Stanley Cup. Stat tracking has also been implemented, as well as team management. You can change play style so your boys play more aggressively in certain circumstances, for example, like a power play. As required in every good hockey game, NHL 5-on-5 2006 does indeed feature fights.    In the current version I have, the rosters are out-of-date. However, when the new season goes live, THQ Wireless will have updated headcounts ready for download straight to the handset. This is an important feature, as robust hockey fans have real emotional attachments to their favorite players, I've come to notice.   NHL 5-on-5 2006 is a good looking game, with small sprites redeemed by fast-moving animation and good detail. You can see all parts of the player's uniforms, from stick to helmet. There is a ticker at the bottom of the screen that details the action when necessary. The color schemes are appropriate for the sports, with lots of cold blues and icy whites.  NHL 5-on-5 2006 doesn't have much competition right now, but it doesn't require comparison to reveal its superiority in the space. This is a great hockey game, full of official licensed touches that will really play to fans. And the presentation is backed up by strong controls and play mechanics. I confess that I am not the world's biggest hockey fan, but I was able to get in there and mix it up with ease. Recommended.", "date": "Oct 12, 2005"}
