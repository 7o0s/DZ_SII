For instance, quantity is no substitute for quality. Namco-Bandai's New Rally-X is a perfect example of quantity over quality. The company is releasing a lot of retro games on Xbox Live Arcade, a good thing because it bulks up XBLA's library. This game, however, wasn't worth bringing back, and it's not worth $5. This is a quantity game; it's nice to see it among the other more desireable games, but all on its own? Nah.   Originally released in 1981, Rally-X was a simple, neat idea. Twenty-five year ago, games like Rally-X were the norm. They were single ideas that drew gamers in and kept them plugging quarters in the arcades. At least, that was the design mentality. Some games, such as Pac-Man and Galaga, while still single-concept games, have aged beautifully. The original concept is still so imaginative and good that despite their lack of depth, they're still great fun to play.   Grab the flags, avoid the terrorists. New Rally-X, which Namco describes as a ~sequel,~ features new courses, improved game balance, and adjustments to enemy cars and new graphics and sound. Calling this a sequel is an exaggeration, perhaps even a falsehood, because New Rally-X isn't new so much as it is a re-tooling of the original. It's really the original game with new courses, which is to say new mazes, and considering there are dozens of similar looking mazes, none of which change the gameplay, none of these additions warrant the word ~New~ or ~sequel.~   That said, if you pretend that games haven't dramatically progressed in the last 26 years, New Rally-X is a fun game for, say, one half hour -- tops. Under Microsoft's original idea, XBLA games would support Xbox Live, present upgraded sound and graphics, and give gamers the ability to see high scores on leaderboards. New Rally-X does the very minimum of support, but like Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man before it, Namco has eschewed any kind of real Xbox Live support, i.e. versus or co-op games. So really, what you're getting with Rally-X are new ~mazes~ and barely noticeable upgraded sound and graphics. Sigh.   Dust your opponents. The game itself hasn't changed. It's still an arcade-style race to grab flags in a maze before the enemy crashes into you. You start with three lives, earn one at 10,000 points and another at 20,000 points, and you try to out-smart the enemy cars using the already existing dirt clods and your own smoke screens. Another little wrinkle features the ability to re-fuel. By re-fueling you prevent enemy cars from starting in the Challenge modes and you'll also have fuel to finish a level. The car ~physics~ and controls are loose as a goose. The controls enable instant 180s, 90-degree turns and the car's speed is always at top level. The maps help a little bit, giving away the location of the next flag.   In all, New Rally-X is probably fun for the pure nostalgia of it. For new gamers who like old retro games it's also a nice way to get acquainted with one really old game that doesn't quite translate to the 21st century.", "date": "Jan 17, 2007"}
