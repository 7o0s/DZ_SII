At first, I was just into the cool little Roman soldiers used in the set but, eventually, I came to have an appreciation of the actual game itself. I kept playing and even joined the chess club once I got into junior high. By the time I got to high school, I had discovered that chess club groupies were pretty frigid so I decided to start a rock band instead. Chess became something I used to do.  But in college, I managed to trick a girl into marrying me and was free to continue my association with chess without fear that it would seriously compromise my chance to be with a woman. You know, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health and whether or not you invite your pretentious friends over to review and play through some old Bobby Fischer or Mikhail Botvinnik games. She also had to put up with me spending hundreds of dollars on Magic cards, but I'm saving that anecdote for a different article.  Features 31 computer opponents Chess tutorial mode Auto Cartridge Save (three save slots) Link cable support for two player (single cartridge) Only for Game Boy Advance  Enter Titus with their newest game, Virtual Kasparov. It's the first chess game for the GBA (beating out the Chessmaster game by a few months) and it's backed by Russian chess player Garry Kasparov. But if Kasparov had much to do with the game, it certainly doesn't show, despite the accompanying indicia. In fact, there's very little evidence of the world champion in the game. Apart from his face in the tutorial and his name in the game, he's not really anywhere else.  The campaign mode in Virtual Kasparov is spread across the entire world. You'll begin by competing with players in Africa and the Americas and, if you're successful, progress to other areas of the world. Each continent has its own set of players (the Americas count as one, Russia and South Asia count as two). Four competitors are available initially on each continent with two secret opponents emerging once you best the first four.  There are stories and backgrounds for each of the fictional competitors that help orient you to the challenge. The info on how these people grew up is kind out pointless but the comments on their skill levels and approaches are useful, if brief. You'll know whether or not they play aggressively or are more liable to make mistakes under pressure. There's no FIDE (or even generic mathematical) skill rating, so you'll have to judge your opponents on the strength of the matches.  In all there's a fair amount of personality in the players. There are definitely some stock moves and some universal tactics. For instance, if you advance your queen pawn against the game's king pawn, the AI will almost always trade pawns with you. In all, the AI is quite good at controlling the center; it gets its knights out early and keeps the bishops back until the center is fairly tight. But the AI isn't infallible. One of the things I despise most about some chess AI is its lack of errors. Errors are an extremely important part of the game and it's cool that the AI in Virtual Kasparov will occasionally make poor moves.  If the story mode doesn't satisfy, you can always play a slightly more casual game in Quick Start mode with any of the opponents who are available in the story mode. There's also a opponent customization feature where you can set up their aggressiveness, attentiveness and overall skill level. In all, the differences seem to show through during play. Maybe this is a form of practice, but it seems kind of strange since there aren't any penalties for losing games in campaign mode.  But as nice as it is in terms of raw chess, Virtual Kasparov is dreadful in terms of presentation. First off, there's no movement notation at all. Given the large useless space to the right of the board (which is normally filled with a picture of your opponent's face), I can't see why there's not at least an option to replace this image with notation of your moves. While I didn't expect any game analysis, I definitely thought the game would include an option to save a list of moves from a given game for later review.  A button to undo a move would be nice in the more casual modes. A cancel button to replace your active piece in its original location would've saved me the rare mistake of putting a piece back in the wrong place and losing a move. The game also fails to advise you when you've been checked. Any or all of these features should definitely have been included.  Graphically there's not a great deal to talk about. The graphics for the game are somewhat simple but still quite effective. The only real variety is in the chessboards, a dozen or so flat 2D boards and two 3D boards. For the most part, the basic black and white linotype set is the best and it's almost immune from the GBA's occasional lighting problems. The other boards and piece sets are a nice change of pace but the color difference between the two sides is sometimes too hard to discern.  For those of you who aren't so sharp on your game, there are a number of tutorial exercises and explanations. Different sections outline the various rules and pieces. Some interesting mating problems and approaches are presented as well. Most of the information is pretty basic but it's useful nonetheless. The textual explanation scrolls across the bottom of the screen and, I have to ask again, What's all that useless space on the right of the board for? Put the text here so I can review it while still looking at the board. In the few recorded grandmaster games included for reference, the scrolling text at the bottom will indicate a potential path of play five moves ahead and it's damn hard to keep up with it all as it scrolls. So far, Virtual Kasparov's the only game in town for chess-loving, GBA owners. On that score, it's ridiculously easy to recommend. But that doesn't mean that the game doesn't suffer from some considerable shortcomings, most notably in the area of presentation. The AI is still good enough to make the game enjoyable and challenging but the lack of some key features leaves you feeling somewhat unsatisfied.I'm going to keep playing this game just for kicks and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who has to get their chess fix soon. Otherwise, I'd suggest waiting to see what kind of shape the Chessmaster game is in when it's released this summer.", "date": "Apr 19, 2002"}
