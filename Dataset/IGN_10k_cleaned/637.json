The game's blend of fast paced action with a real-time strategy game focus was incredible, but what really grabbed me was the game's Cold War in space feel. The retro-tech look of the armament, the anti-Soviet propaganda spouted by your superiors and the creepy idealism of the entire game reminded me of some of my more twisted dreams growing up under the Reagan administration. Sadly, Pandemic has thrown all of that out in favor of a much more familiar storyline. As the game opens, a simple monologue brings you up to date with how things turned out after the last game. Eventually, we made peace with the Soviets and agreed to split the available bio-metal (that's what all this space fighting has been about for those of you who weren't around for the first title) between the two super-powers. Everything settled down into a simple peace with a few small arguments over who gets rights to which piece of land. Or at least that's what they're telling the kids back home. In reality, there's a Secret Ops division who's responsible for exploring and protecting the deep reaches of our mining facilities from threats both external and internal. A few minutes into the game, they get a threat like nothing they've ever seen before. A strange group of unknown craft have started blowing up Secret Ops bases on Pluto. It's your job as a Lieutenant in this hush-hush group to start helping your country get rid of 'em.  After a few missions on Pluto, you'll manage to run off the alien invasion which you'll trace to a previously unknown planet on the outskirts of our solar system. On this Dark Planet, you'll have your hands full with another set of missions trying to reclaim the property that you didn't even know existed. During your final battle on the Dark Planet, the retreating forces of your enemy, who you're currently referring to as the Scions, open up a huge dimensional portal and send their entire army through it to escape. For some mysterious reason, your general insists that your group follow them through the portal to stop them. Once you land on the other side, you're cut off from your home, with a dwindling assault force on a strange swamp-like world that's crawling with enemy units. While I don't want to give too much of the game away (actually I've already given a fair bit away), I will tell you that I found the shift from a truly unique storyline featuring two Earthbound superpowers battling it out for the rights to materials in space a real let down. Do we really need another game in which we face an unknown alien from another dimension?  The game's mission design has much the same problem. In the original game, your job was to set up bases, mine bio-metal and then assist your superiors whenever possible. Pandemic decided that this wasn't enough and has gone out of their way to try and use the same old set up to create new situations for the player to explore. While this isn't a bad idea in and of itself, the way they went about doing it often seems very contrived and counter-intuitive. On one particular rescue mission, your commander has hidden herself inside a cavern to nurse her injuries. You have to jump out of your tank to go and find her and when you do, she tells you that you need to travel to a friendly base to get help  on foot. Never mind the fact that you have a huge tank sitting right outside the door. Many of the other mission situations you find yourself in are the same. On one early mission, your commander leaves you all alone to defend a base from swarms of attackers in order to rescue a soldier who has come on the com-link with a plea for help. Later the general contacts you and tells you that the base contains equipment that is absolutely vital to the cause. He doesn't order anyone back to the base to help you, your commander doesn't decide that saving one life isn't worth losing the entire battle. In both of these situations, if you fail in any way  the enemy detects you in the first mission, or the enemy grabs one of the cargo units in the second, you lose the game. What this means in practice is that in most missions you must first play through five or six times to figure out where all the enemy attacks are going to come from and then make sure that you're in the right place at the right time. Completely lost is the fluidity of the first game, where you could succeed right away, or suffer serious set backs and have to retreat for a while in order to get the power and units you needed to win the mission. Now you're on a very narrow and very scripted path and you must succeed exactly the way the designers wanted you to or not at all. In a game that's this open and command oriented, a really essential feeling of freedom and power is completely lost.  The flaws in mission design and storyline are a real shame, because they obscure what is, on just about every other level, a game that far outperforms its two year old ancestor. The engine works brilliantly, offering up not only silky smooth gameplay, but graphics and physics that are far beyond those presented the first time around. The game's environments are truly remarkable. They're filled with real world objects like trees, rocks and lakes, all of which act like you'd imagine they would in a combat situation. If you shoot a tree, it will either catch on fire or fall to the ground smashing anything underneath it. If you jump into a lake, you won't show up on the enemy's scanners. If you put too much weight on an unstable rock formation, it will crumble underneath with possibly devastating results. While this was also a move away from the feel of the original game (even lifeless planets like Pluto don't convey the same atmosphere of barrenness that the original title did), I'm pretty pleased with this one. Still, even in the open jungle worlds, you'll find that the maps have been created in a way so as to offer only one or two choices as to which way you should go in a given situation. You're never really able to wander over the face of these beautiful worlds, you pretty much always seem to be confined to a tight canyon or a walled base.  The weapons and enemies in the game are nice and well detailed, but don't really add anything new to the game. In addition to loads of old standards like chain guns and lasers, you'll also get access to a few new mine weapons and several cool mortars. The sniper rifle is a nice touch from the first person view, but since most of the enemies in the game move with frustrating randomness, it's often completely useless. I liked the design of the new enemies, but they seemed somewhat lifeless to me. Basically they were just big machines that boasted different levels of toughness or firepower and I sized them up accordingly. I never seemed to run into anything that really moved me in any emotional sort of way. Base structures and designs could also be filed under this heading of More of the Same. They were all beautiful, but for the most they all serve the same purpose as they did the last time around. Let's move on...  There are a few problems with Battlezone II that don't fall under the mission design or storyline heading. First off, while the game has some really nice voice acting and pretty good sound effects, the sound of the power plant is so loud and annoying that just about any mission that it shows up in all you want to do is to fly away from it as fast as possible. Since listening to various aspects of the game is important, you can't turn it off either. It got so I could hear that low thrumming sound in my sleep. Second, and perhaps more importantly, Battlezone II has some pretty serious crash bugs flitting around. On several occasions, my game would just lock up and I'd have to exit out, reboot and start the mission back over. Both of these little glitches could have been fixed with some solid play-testing, but as they are, they're both really annoying.  While there's no doubt that I do have some real problems with Battlezone II, the game is still pretty darn good. Most of my real issues with the title can be boiled down to disappointment. The original Battlezone was one of the greatest games I've ever played, and knowing what I know about the talents of the designers and programmers at Pandemic, I thought that the sequel would be even better. Sadly, it's not. Even though this title will most likely keep action fans more than happy for months to come, its vision and its feel just aren't as compelling as those of the original title.  -- Trent C.
