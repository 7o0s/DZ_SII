The series -- now in its third installment for PC -- has long been a favorite of die-hard 3D shooter fans. Unofurtnately though, Quake has never translated well to home console, often showing up slower, uglier and without the addictive multiplayer mayhem that made the franchise such a hit amongst PC users to being with.Now, Quake II has arrived for Nintendo 64 -- a long, long time after the PC original. Unlike Midway's ~port~ of Quake to the console, however, Quake II N64 is largely a fresh, new game; though it's based in the Quake universe, Nintendo 64 owners get a whole slew of exclusive levels specifically designed with the platform in mind, Expansion Pak support for boosted framerates and added visual effects, a very strong sense of speed comparable to the PC original and, probably most important of all, a top-notch multiplayer mode.The Facts All-new completely original levels. Classic Quake II arsenal includes 11 weapons. 4MB Expansion Pak support for enhanced visuals. Four-player multiplayer modes. Emphasis on speed. Customizable player profiles. Customizable control setups. Eerie sound effects and music. Memory Pak saves between levels. Rumble Pak support. 12MB cart.The GameQuake II N64 is developed by Raster Productions, the same software house that brought Doom and Quake home to Nintendo 64. According to the game's producer Marty Stratton, a clear set of goals were established quickly into the creation process of the title: first, Quake II N64 had to be original. Raster ported Quake to Nintendo 64 and the game fizzled out quickly for obvious reasons, namely the fact that PC owners had already seen the product two years before it ever hit home-consoles and late ports just don't cut the mustard. Second, it had to be fast. The Quake franchise is all about blazing speeds and addictive multiplayer action -- to sacrifice either could prove to be disastrous. And third, the game had to feature a strong multiplayer mode. Quake II N64 delivers all of the above and then some.The storyline behind the game is typical of the series. ~You're a space marine.~ Imagine that! An enemy alien race known as the Strogg have invaded Earth and are determined to wipe the human race off the planet forever. Luckily Earth has you on its side, an elite special forces type bad-ass marine Strogg-killing machine. In order for you to save the planet you love from a psychotic race of robotic-flesh hybrids, you're going to have to do some killing. Actually, you're going to have to do plenty of killing -- and that's just the way you like it.Though the game utilizes a standard control-setup similar to that found in Turok 2 (meaning players aim with the analog stick and move around with the C buttons), gamers have the option to choose between six additional setups or customize their own. Likewise, control sensitivity can be customized, as can player profiles (including skins, names and colors). All of this can be saved to Memory Pak for use at any time.Quake II N64 controls tight and with a surprising amount of speed. Players expecting to find the annoying jerky framerates associated with Turok 2 are in for a real treat here as the game usually runs very smooth -- especially with the 4MB Expansion Pak. In addition to the standard shoot-and-kill stuff, players can jump, crawl and activate switches positioned in various locations across the game's many levels. Each stage has specific goals that need doing -- some more easy than others. For example, gamers might be asked to deactivate a force-field, which requires them to first find explosives and then place them atop a computer located in one part of a level. This is a very simple task, but because players will also have to deal with a host of angry Strogg, the situation is made much more difficult. It's all very traditional Quake II stuff, but with brand new levels to explore and a decidedly Nintendo 64-look. Amazingly though, everything moves along at a super-speed pace. Imagine Turok 2 and multiple the game's sensation of speed by at least two. Very impressive.MultiplayerLet's face the facts here, Quake N64's multiplayer mode left a lot to be desired. First of all, it only featured a two-player split-screen deathmatch mode and second of all, even that ran with a horrible framerate. So when we first heard that Raster Productions was planning a four-player mode for Quake II, we were admittedly skeptical. Luckily, the developer has eased any doubts we might have had with a very strong multiplayer offering that -- much like the single-player game -- runs with a beautiful sensation of speed and still looks pretty darn good.Deathmatch modes and options includes: 10 unique arenas. Deathmatch: One to four-players fight it out in an every man for himself fashion. Frag-Teams: Two-on-two standard. Supposing one player is particularly skilled, it's also possible to play three-on-one. Interestingly, if the solo deathmatcher kills any of his three opponents it will count as three frags. Meanwhile, if the three-man team scores a kill, it will only count as one frag. This keeps the game balanced. Flag Wars: The name says it all -- it's capture the flag. Death Tag: This mode is timed. Located somewhere in the arena is one flag. Players must search for it and retrieve it. The person who amounts the most time in possession of the flag at the end of the match wins.LoadingPlayAdditionally, players can set frag and time limits for each match and, even better, switch arenas in mid-deathmatch.Two-player deathmatch runs just as smooth if not smoother than the single-player game. The mode is very unlike GoldenEye as it's all about speed and not so much hunting strategy. Players who can think fast are likely to walk away the winner. Those who can't are likely to eat a lot of rockets. All of the weapons of the single-player match are present here and there are 10 unique levels to play through. While three-players can easily continue to deathmatch with no problems, bringing a fourth gamer onto the screen results in some significant slowdown now and again. Turok 2's four-player mode, by comparison, is the faster of the two... oddly enough. Everything said and done, though, Quake II N64 still dishes out one of the very best multiplayer modes to be had on Nintendo 64 -- hands down.GraphicsQuake II N64 can be played two ways -- with or without the Expansion Pak. The difference between the two isn't exactly night and day, but it's noticeable all the same. Without the extra RAM, the game runs a bit slower, control is more jerky and colors don't seem as rich. With it, framerates are smoothed out, control feels slightly more precise and colors more vibrant. We honestly think the benefits of the Pak are worth the purchase.Comparing Quake II N64 to the PC version isn't really fair, as the two versions are very different in all around design. Whereas the PlayStation version of Quake II looks very much like a low-resolution version of the PC game, the Nintendo 64 incarnation comes off more like Doom and Quake for the console before it, only faster and more detailed. Like Raster Productions' port of Quake, Quake II N64 is very colorful, featuring loads of pre-colored textures that serve to create ambient 3D environments. But a number of additions have been implemented for the sequel. For example, Quake II N64 features real-time dynamic lighting effects for missiles that light up hallways as they go, and nailguns that illuminate the immediate area as they fire, or even explosions that give off a burst of light as they boom. Texture quality has been significantly improved over Quake, though it's still a long way from perfect. Guns in particular lack detail and animation, giving off a very generic, boring look. Similarly poor is the game's assortment of particle effects; missile streams appear blocky, as do sprite explosions, blood and gunfire marks. On the bright side (please excuse the pun), overhead lights feature Unreal-like Lens-flares, though they are significantly dumbed down to fit Nintendo 64's hardware. Raster Productions has also done a nice job rotating between polygon and sprite explosions depending on the situation. If a player shoots a missle directly at an enemy a sprite explosion is used to keep framerates in check. However, if no enemy comes in contact with the missile, a polygonal ground explosion is animated. One of the most important aspects of any first-person shooter is its framerate and Quake II N64 features an impressive one. The game runs smooth at nearly all times, only slowing down when a player turns a corner into a big room or in four-player mode. We are very impressed by the game's fluidity and hope that more developers follow in Raster's footsteps.SoundIf you've ever played Doom 64 then you've probably got a good idea how Quake II N64 sounds. Imagine ambient effects and eerie background noise. We were hoping for a bit more in this department. Raster Productions only had a 12MB cart to work with, we realize, but how many times can we hear the Doom soundtrack before it becomes repetitive? Enemy grunts and howls are of the typical Quake choice, but there is nothing here that's going to blow you away one way or the other.I'm very impressed with Quake II N64 overall. Raster Productions has delivered a 3D first-person shooter that is nearly just as fast and furious as the PC original, and one that features a strong multiplayer mode that is truly hard to come by on Nintendo 64. The game's smooth sense of speed and consistent framerate goes a long way and, when mixed with a plethora of options that include 4MB Expansion Pak support, customizable controls and player setups, newly added real-time lighting effects, lens-flares and other various visual goodies, I honestly don't see how gamers can go wrong.A few words of warning though: controls do feel a bit jerky without the use of the Expansion Pak, especially when entering large rooms with lots of polys. And, the four-player mode still suffers from slowdown -- even with the use of the Pak.Otherwise, an excellent effort by Raster Productions. If you've never played Quake II, this game is for you. And if you have, give it a rent anyway. You might just like it.", "date": "Jul 2, 1999"}
