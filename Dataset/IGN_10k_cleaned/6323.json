For  example, a puzzle game based on the new ~Zorro~ movie. The concept of trying to link up sword pieces from a screen full of hilts and blades to help Zorro fight off scoundrels doesn't sound that great when it's written out, but in practice, The Legend of Zorro: Swordfight is quite engaging. Definitely more engaging than the cookie-cutter action game Sony recently released, based on the new flick.   The top of the screen in The Legend of Zorro: Swordfight depicts a furious swordfight between Zorro and some rapscallion. In order to help Zorro defeat him, you have to link a hilt on the left side of the screen to a sword tip on the right. Simply move the cursor around the screen and rotate sword pieces to make a complete blade. When you do, the action associated with the icon to the right of the blade tip is activated.   Activate enough punches and lunges, and Zorro will lay the bandito to waste. Then it's off to the next round. You can really finish fights quickly if you manage to create more than one sword at a time -- the doubled-up actions (or tripled) do great damage.   The Legend of Zorro: Swordfight has a nice, crisp game screen. The little fight offers up a few cool animations. The game plays the ~Zorro~ theme and has a few in-game sound effects.  I was expecting The Legend of Zorro: Swordfight to be more of a throwaway game, but it caught me off-guard. There is some real meat to this themed puzzler, as you try to line up sword moves as fast as possible. Get too greedy with arranging double and triple strikes and Zorro will fall. If you're looking for a slightly different puzzler than the current batch of ~line up colors~ or whatnot, give The Legend of Zorro: Swordfight a look.", "date": "Nov 10, 2005"}
