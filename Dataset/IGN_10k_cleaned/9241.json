These games fill your mobile screen with a collection of little people, set them up in social chess games, and then let you make moves by courting, cavorting, and clashing with the cast on the way to an ultimate goal. At first blush, American Popstar Road to Celebrity looked like it could have been a ho-hum extension of the series set in the ~American idol~ universe. But within minutes of experiencing the game's fantastic pacing and whip-smart writing, the game is transformed into Gameloft's best take yet on its social sim series.   Before getting into the heart of the review, I have to call special attention to the writing in American Popstar. This is easily the best scripted mobile game out of Gameloft yet, and that includes the studio's recently released CSI: Miami title, which nailed the show's tone. The dialogue is fun and ribald with lots of tongue-in-cheek moments. Any game that features a spectral rock star telling me I need to ~merge~ with my old girlfriend gets an extra point. (Not really, but you get the idea.) From the clever quips of the ghost to the fun comments by the hero's mother, the storyline absolutely sings in American Popstar.   The game follows the career of a young popstar wannabe, determined to achieve global superstardom. The first chapter of the game pokes the idea of internet and Idol-esque fame right in the eye. You use the internet to post videos of yourself to gain attention, for example, and mess around with a MySpace-ish social networking site where popularity is measured not by the quality of posting, but by the number of friends you can sign up. Then, you go on to a reality show that combines ~American Idol~ and ~The Real World,~ complete with taped confessions and staged crises. By the end of the first hour or so of play, you're on stage at the finale of the reality show, wondering if this is all there really was to the game.   And then you lose.   Losing the reality show is just the jumping off point for your career, though. With instant fame snatched from your fingertips, you must now claw your way up through actually recording songs, booking gigs at clubs, and pressing the flesh. There are some story twists as you push through the game, such as dealing with the ghost, a special badge you have in your pocket, and other funny things that I don't care to ruin here.   To achieve your goals, you must chat up everybody you meet, from record producers to the other cast mates on the show. When you enter into a conversation, you can try compliments or bringing up subjects that would be interesting to the other person. Each person has their own dialogue trees, so you can pick topics you think might be relevant in an effort to score points and boost things like charisma. You can give gifts, get in fights, and josh around in the quest to increase your popularity. You can also kiss people, and the situations where love is involved are often the best in the game -- especially because that's when the writers really get to let loose.   There are mini-games for singing and dancing that you must play along with when certain events come up, such as a dance off or belting on stage. These are minor little piffles and not terribly difficult to keep up with, but that's okay because the main reason to keep playing is to inhale more of the excellent story.   The interface is smart. You have an iPhone-ish little cell that help you keep track of fast facts. You only need one thumb to browse dialogue options or choose actions, like picking fights or giving gifts. Red arrows tell you what you need to do next, but you can turn those off to make the game more of a challenge. Most of the environments are interactive, too, from toilets to fridges, so be sure to explore and see everything the game has to offer.   American Popstar looks great. The game is definitely a member of Gameloft's social sim family, featuring little characters that look awfully familiar to players of past entries like Miami Nights. However, there is a touch more expression here, and it goes a long way to giving the game much more personality than previous social sim games. The color use is fantastic. The audio is also pretty good, but I definitely think more people need to listen to the soundtracks of Digital Chocolate games and understand the need for catchy hooks.American Popstar was a fantastic surprise to play this weekend -- I had a great time pushing through the conversations, always curious to see what would happen next. The game also gives you enough leeway to experiment with different things and see what happens if you push boundaries. (Go ahead and kiss your mom on the mouth, pervert.) There is a lot of game in here, too, for just the one-time download fee. An average player will get several hours out of American Popstar if they really explore the world and see what it has to offer. And again, the writing in this game is really top-notch. I love that this is on mobile, but as I've said about many other great mobile games in the past, Gameloft should consider taking this to other platforms, such as Live Arcade. More people deserve to play this.", "date": "Oct 15, 2007"}
