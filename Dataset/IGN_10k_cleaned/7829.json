Is it the pact between Anakin and Senator Palpatine that would go on to vapourise entire planets and create an enduring evil icon? Or could it be the heroic team formed some twenty years later, when Obi-Wan and Luke Skywalker set in motion the events that would bring down an empire? Or is it option C, where a sassy girl accidentally rescues a robot from a pile of scrap metal, and now it thinks she's its mum? It is, of course, option C. But we're not being completely fair. The ~sassy girl~ is the ex-slave, acrobat and mercenary Twi'Lek Rianna Saren, and we just plain lied about the mum thing.   The events of Lethal Alliance take place just after the third film, when you're asked by Kyle Katarn (the guy from the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight games, extended universe fans) to meet this Princess Leia woman about maybe doing some missions. The money seems right, the robot seems keen and so you're in. Even for non-fanatics, this is the kind of just pre-Death Star era in which you want to be toting your blaster.    Game-wise, levels are a combination of standard third-person shooting, embellished with wall-dancing - from the Prince of Persia stable - and team combos with your sidekick, Zeeo. Sadly, Twi'Lek doesn't have the same sense of natural control as Ubisoft's Prince, but you still feel pretty pleased with yourself when you pull off a decent flip from a wall and land with your Thorn of Ryloth in some guy's brain. Lethal Alliance also finds time to throw in a couple of flying levels too, where you dangle from your tin mate's rusty flaps as he soars through the local terrain. Of course, if he could do that all along, it makes a mockery of all your cool platforming moves, but let's just re-suspend that disbelief - the acrobatics are one of the most satisfying aspects of the game.   In fact, Lethal Alliance is at its strongest when it finds the balance between its platforming and combat elements. When you're cartwheeling around with a robot between your legs, having skated along the ceiling only to pop off and perform a bullet-time instant kill, it comes pretty close to feeling like you're using the Force. But the game falls off the tightrope far too often: the biggest culprit being the clumsy controls, courtesy of the distinctly non-mustard cutting PSP nubbin. When Lethal Alliance gets overly platform-y, frequent instant death plunges are almost unavoidable. Equally problematic is the repetitive fighting system, which is particularly evident when the game locks you in a room full of endlessly respawning enemies while you figure out what to tell Zeeo to do. What's more, although the enemy AI is clever enough to get your opponents ducking behind boxes, it's a shame for them that they're those type of boxes that explode magically on contact with blaster fire.   Your hovering robot sidekick, however, brings the game some way out of potentially dire lock-shoot-dodge mediocrity. When you take control of Zeeo in his first-person sequences, it's a refreshing change - until you realise you're just going down corridors and avoiding predictably-patterned lasers. The weapon upgrades are much of a shooter-y muchness too (blaster, bigger blaster with less ammo, grenades, sniper rifle), but Zeeo's a boomerang, a shield generator, a partner in your acrobatic displays. It's incredible people got anything done in galactic espionage without him, and his skills unlock slowly so you're never overwhelmed.     Even with these more innovative powers giving the game an edge, you're still stuck wading through bland mission design - all the Star Wars bells and whistles in the galaxy couldn't mask the fact that the game feels like a repetitive slog. To be fair, it's a diverting enough slog, but when you've just cleared another room full of droids and up comes the message ~Mission Accomplished: Intel Acquired~, you've generally sunken into such a repetition-induced glaze, it comes as something of a surprise to be reminded that there were missions at all, let alone the fact you were after some intel. Sadly, by turning proceedings into a gymnastic killing spree, the Star Wars lore at the time of the Rebel Alliance's conception feels completely wasted. Don't get us wrong: we enjoy killing robots for no good reason, but the overall effect is that the whole Star Wars mythology ends up sitting awkwardly on top of the game's utterly generic missions, like a thimble on a beach ball.   As for the multiplayer, there's not too much to report. It takes the form of a two-player deathmatch. It's definitely not a reason to buy the game; the combat of the single-player doesn't translate well at all into fighting a human foe.Ultimately, Lethal Alliance does exceedingly well at being a completely adequate game. Progress is constant, obvious (like flashing arrows obvious) and easy. When we say easy, we mean it - don't play the game on easy mode - that's double super easy, and you might as well play no-brick Tetris. The trouble is, Lethal Alliance never breaks out of being simply...okay. Despite the transparent efforts to give the game variety, you all too often feel like you're playing through the same-old over and over again. Even some unique attempts at fleshing-out combat - with  flesh/mech tag-team special manoeuvres and bullet-time - quickly lose their lustre, becoming something to do to get to more plot and the fanfare-free end of level. Admittedly, fans of Star Wars will likely get off on meeting Darth Vader and seeing Wookies at work in a mine, but a few cool bits don't make an average game good.", "date": "Dec 14, 2006"}
