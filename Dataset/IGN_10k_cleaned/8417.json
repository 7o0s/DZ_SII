And it's a word you'd definitely associate with Goemon. ~Ganbare Goemon~ is the name of a series of games in Japan, produced by Konami and starring a lovable misfit ninja with spiky blue hair. It's a franchise that's been steadily popular overseas for over two decades. Domestically, though, Ganbare Goemon has never gone for it, or done its best. It's been held back, cut apart and given some odd localizations that, over the years, have kept the series from finding any real audience outside Japan. Probably the best game that did manage to make the leap to the States is this SNES adventure, translated, watered down and re-presented as The Legend of the Mystical Ninja.        Luckily, the gameplay isn't harmed at all. Konami made some odd choices in renaming characters and altering storylines in bringing Goemon and his world to the US, but the core of the game escaped undamaged. The Legend of the Mystical Ninja is an action/adventure title that's built on a blend of two different styles of gameplay. The first is most similar to games in the beat-'em-up brawler genre, as Goemon explores towns, fights enemies and visits shops in a manner that players of games like River City Ransom would find familiar. The second is more platforming-focused, when you venture into strictly 2D side-scrolling stages that play in a way reminiscent of other Konami franchises like Contra and Castlevania.   Each stage in Mystical Ninja has a piece of both styles of play, and Goemon grows in strength and ability over the course of the quest. His standard weapon is a blunt, wooden smoking pipe, but collecting power-ups dropped from defeated foes will upgrade it with longer reach, then upgrade it again into a spiked yo-yo. Distance attacks are always at the ready, too, as long as you can afford it  Mystical Ninja lets you throw your money at enemies as a long-range weapon. Defensive items, health-replenishing food and more can be found and purchased in shops and stores.    The reason for Goemon's big adventure is, of course, a girl. The quest is to save the kidnapped Princess Yuki, and though the plot seems pretty simple and standard, the game presents it so well that you can't help but love Goemon's world. Cutscenes are illustrated vibrantly, with large, comical characters and tons of personality. The translation isn't the best  Goemon is referred to as ~Kid Ying~  but all of the other elements are there. The soundtrack, in particular, is superb. You'd be hard-pressed to find many superior scores in the rest of the SNES library.   The game's greatest selling point, though, is its co-operative play. This ninja quest is great when undertaken alone, but it adds a whole other level of fun when you get a friend in on the action with you. Player 2 takes control of Goemon's chunky, smiling, goofy friend Ebisumaru, who attacks his foes with the power of a vicious paper fan. It's a blast to run around each level in tandem, and there are even some tag-team moves you can pull off  one player can take a piggy-back ride on another, for example, leaving the rider to control attacking and the rided to handle jumping and movement. Fans of other co-op experiences previously seen on the VC should certainly take notice here.Anime is more popular than ever before, and manga can be found now in even the most mainstream of American bookstores. The culture of the United States, then, might be more ready now for the world of Goemon. Konami's watered down localization of this title as The Legend of the Mystical Ninja damaged its potential appeal in its first release, now 16 years ago. And, today, that's still the main negative to associate with the game. But that's just one negative, and there is a wealth of great, counterbalancing positive elements contained here that outweigh any faults. Two-player co-operative play, great graphics and sound, tons of depth and even lots of little mini-games to be found and played throughout all combine to make this one game you don't want to overlook again. Goemon's a great character, and his series deserves much more credit and respect than it's received over the years. Strong support for this title on the Virtual Console could mean more from the blue-haired pipe-fighter in the future, even a chance at seeing some of his unreleased Japan-only sequels come to our shores for the first time. So get on the Wii Shop, put down 800 Points and support this underappreciated adventure  help a ninja do his best. Ganbare, Goemon.", "date": "Apr 30, 2007"}
