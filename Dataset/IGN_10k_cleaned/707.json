For all the rest of us, the cry of ~What the-? A TRAIN SIMULATOR?~ can be heard plenty loud. Now unless there's some sort of underground train collecting cabal, or some Locomotive Illuminati, people besides train collectors are picking up this title. Maybe that's no big surprise, seeing how great games like Sim City and The Sims have broadened the minds of gamers to the joys of micro-management. But while the PC Railroad Tycoon 2 had its moments (and sold like the dickens), these type of games always fall apart on the PlayStation as soon as all those multitudes of statistics and figures hit the low resolution of your dusty old Zenith. So it goes, so it goes.  Gameplay  The point of Railroad Tycoon 2 is simple: guide your startup company to wealth and prosperity from the railroading roots in the early 1800's to the early 20th Century. As you progress through history, labor shortages and corporate takeovers will throw wrenches into your operation. However, technology presses on, and innovations in steam and coal will lead to better, faster, more reliable trains. The key to fixing these economic roadblocks (or is that trackblocks?) is resource management.  Almost a year ago, I reviewed the PC version of RRTII. What amazed me was that, although targeted at hardcore train collectors and hobbyists, I still managed to walk away with a pleasant experience. The key to RRTII's fun lies in the depth of play, more specifically in the face that there are really 3 different ways to play.   You can beat each level by simply going for the required objectives for the particular scenario (whether it be to simply connect from one city to the next, or earn a certain amount of money by the end of a given year), or you can pay attention to the individual needs of each town you've laid track through. For instance, Seattle may need more passengers in 1957 because tourism is down. Well, it just so happens that Portland has a pack of people itching to see the sights of the rain-drizzled city, but they have no way of getting there. Likewise, Portland needs lumber. Now, the objectives for completing the scenario may not include a Seattle-Portland link, but you'll make more money by meeting supply and demand in the cities if you take the time to deliver good and services to needy cities. More money means the ability to lay down more track or more profits at the end of the year. Of course, all of this micromanagement can be brushed to the side in favor of simply completing the required tasks at hand at pretty much any time.  On top of all this management is the third and possibly most money-worthy ability: that of playing the stock market. By selling shares and seeking investments, you can multiply your earnings a hundred fold. The problem is, if you offer too much in the way of bonds or stocks, you'll spend more of your time paying back investors and raising stock value than making money. It's the ability to pick up or drop these micromanagement details virtually on the fly that gives Railroad Tycoon II its depth.   Everything in RRTII is cursor-driven, and so a clean, easy to use interface is key. Luckily, with a little studying of your game manual, you'll find that the interface offers access to everything you'll need, although it's no where near as informative or eye-pleasing as the PC version (more on that later). From the menu, you can access every aspect of railroad management. Lay track, build train stations and upgrade various components of said stations, buy trains, sell stock, sell bonds -- all within 2 or 3 clicks. The problem with the interface, and pretty much the whole game in general, isn't the available options; it's in the graphic execution...  Graphics  The PC version required a resolution of 1024X768, a resolution that no console can offer right now (or ever, until HDTV arrives). After seeing the game through the 320x240-resolution eyes of the PlayStation, your retinas will never forgive you. Smaller details, like plumes of smoke rising from steel mills and houses, or being able to tell what cars are on a train, or even what train is in use at a glance are all but gone. Text, including the names of cities on-screen, are near-illegible and the aforementioned details are nonexistent. It's not that the PlayStation version necessarily lacks any of the features that the PC version had, it's that there's no real way of bringing them all to you, while still making the game a pleasure to look at. In lieu of large, splashy stills in some of the menus, screen-fulls of text are thrown onto the screen. This approach to delivering info often causes a bit of a sensory overload -- add to that the fact that it's usually in garbled low-red text and you've got a info nightmare.   Due to limits in the PlayStation's memory and the smaller amounts of screen real estate at it's low resolution, the incredibly useful option of a ~picture-in-a-picture~ window that the PC offered is gone. The PIP would let you click on a train, and then do your work, while the smaller window followed the train's path. This way, when a break down or other problem occurred, you could quickly hop to the problem area on the big map. Without it on the PS, the game is a chore to play.  Sound  The beauty of Railroad Tycoon II's sound is that there hardly is any. Button presses are met with a satisfying ~chunk~, and all the normal sounds that befit trains are here. When a train does come into a station, three quick dings alert you to check the bottom of the screen for info regarding station, payload, and cash made from the particular stop. When a train is centered on screen, the familiar ~chug-chug-chug~ comes through loud and clear, but as it moves off screen, it slowly fades, a nice touch.   Unfortunately, the sparse effects were complemented with a perfect bluegrass-styled harmonica fest of melody on the PC. The music of RRTII, while not award-worthy by any means, was good. What made it great was the fact that it didn't permeated the game, while still lightly gliding across the aural palette. It never interfered, but I didn't notice how much of a part of the game it was until I noticed: The PlayStation version doesn't have it! No, you're left to chug and chunk your way across the US without aid of ANY soundtrack. Bad move.  I know I've drawn comparisons to the PC version in every category, from sound to graphics, and that's mainly because RRT2 PC set a great benchmark for what a genre-specific sim could offer for both fans of the genre, and casual gamers alike. That's why I was so disappointed in the PlayStation port. It's not that the game itself is horrible, or that it has lost the depth or charm of the PC version, it's that all this great gameplay is buried under a horrible graphic and aural  presentation. Face it, there's no reason to get this game if you've got a PC -- and if you're reading this right now, you've got a PC (and yes, it's on the Mac too). The gameplay is there, but only if you squint.", "date": "Feb 12, 2000"}
