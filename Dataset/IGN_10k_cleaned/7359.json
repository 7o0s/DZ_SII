However, the series has since veered into ~fantasy~ operations, putting Delta Forces in situations where the elite soldiers can clean house against a cabal of terrorists. Team Sabre continues the trend on mobile, following the fictional (as far as we know) exploits of Team Sabre as they sweep into South America and the Middle East.   The game id vidided into ten stages, but each stage has both an on-foot sequence and a helo mission where an auto-pilot flies a Black Hawk over enemy territory and you control the target cursor of the chopper's guns. Two different game play concepts usually equals two different levels of success, and the case of Team Sabre does not buck the formula. The Black Hawk missions devolve into shooting galleries, as your helo encircles enemy camps or city blocks, as you pump hot lead into terrorist thugs (that stand next to -- wait for it -- exploding barrels) and vehicles like tanks. These are pretty breezy compared to the more tactical on-foot missions, an arcade-y relief from a fairly gritty action strategy game.   On foot, you control three commandoes, each with a specialty important to success: sniper, engineer, and gunner. The engineer, for example, can hack security systems and call in air strikes. The gunner is the brawn of the operation, a highly training killing machine with big guns and big armor, able to take out entire groups of enemies with a spray of fire. The sniper is a surgical shooter, able to pinpoint single targets from a great distance, as well as give them team a satellite view of the area. You need to keep all three alive, because losing the skill set of any of the commandoes makes getting through tough combat situations much harder. Lose the sniper and you're flying blind, able to only see what's in the immediate vicinity. As any soldier will tell you, intel is as important as guts, and the loss is heavily felt, especially in the jungle missions.   These foot missions will remind gamers of previous mobile tactical shooters, such as Ghost Recon, Rainbow 6, and the awesome SOCOM. The controls are fairly similar, with you controlling a cursor that moves characters and initiates actions. If you like this style of game -- a thinking man's shooter -- then these sequences will entertain. The addition of a third operative gives the game even more strategy than SOCOM in some respects, but I liked the levels design in SOCOM better than Black Hawk Down.   I tested Black Hawk Down on a Blade -- the game looks great on a crisp screen. The color palette, while limited, is certainly appropriate for desert and jungle combat. The animations are solid and the level of detail in the vehicles, enemies, and backdrops is quite good.  Black Hawk Down came as a bit of a surprise, as I was initially put off by the first helo level. Fortunately, as soon as you finish the shooting gallery, you can get right into the thick of the game, advancing through enemy territory step by step, using the teams' skills in tandem to meet objectives. If this kind of action is your bag, Black Hawk Down will not disappoint. Well, over half of it won't.", "date": "Oct 12, 2006"}
