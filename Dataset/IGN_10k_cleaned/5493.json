The GBA installment mixes racing with a basic trick system, rewarding racers with added boost power for completing tricks. Though certain tricks can be linked in mid-air to score bonus points, the system is a bit shallow, giving players no more than a dozen combinations to work with. Along with the trick system, racers collect items during the race much like Mario Kart or Wipeout. These power-ups add an extra element of strategy, though they are basic in function giving players an added bost of speed or invulnerability for a short time. While it can be exciting launching your favorite Hot Wheels cars off jumps and through loops, the trick library is just too small, and players are left with virtually no replay value after a few hours of play.While Stunt Track Challenge offers four modes of play, the bulk of the game lies in Game Show mode, where players enter the ~Stunt Track Challenge~ in an attempt to defeat the opposition in six ~exciting episodes~ to become the Stunt Track Challenge Champion. The host Ryan Storm (who looks mysteriously like the love child of American Idol's host Ryan Seacrest and Carrot Top.) gives introductions between every race event, which can range from one-on-one races, to stunt-based challenges. The other three modes of the game are single events, all of which are featured in ~Game Show~ mode. ~Arcade~ and ~Check Point Challenge~ are the two main Arcade modes, featuring any of the unlocked cars and tracks in a quick race mode. The 3rd arcade mode ~Test Track~ is simply a one player time trial, allowing players to test out any track or car unlocked. Unlockable cars and tracks are a great idea, if it wasn't for the lack of battery save. Since STC lacks a save function, players are forced to record an 8 digit password to keep track of their unlocked cars and tracks. Not only does password save hurt the four main modes of play, it makes the game less ~Portable,~ which is the entire appeal to GBA titles. Multiplayer is available, but is held captive by the same restraints as the arcade modes, allowing players to use only the cars and tracks unlocked in Game Show mode. There is no link ability, so players are left with a ~Hot Potato~ style of multiplayer, trading off to see who can score the most points or complete tracks the fastest.Stunt Track Challenge offers decent presentation elements, but comes up short in a few key areas. The most recent series of Hot Wheels cars are available, each offering multiple color schemes. The frame rate holds relatively strong, but there is a lack of detail in the environments. Since Stunt Track Challenge pushes its engine, using polygons to create a pseudo-3D landscape, there is less cart space for strong textures and power-up effects. The music is simply average as well, delivering decent sound quality, but not much variety between tracks. Audio effects sound like a 1st generation GBA title, using short sound clips and recycled sounds for different actions. The sound and graphical presentation is there and functional, but the short sound clips and flat backgrounds fail to create the illusion of racing in a real world.Hot Wheels Stunt Track Challenge changes the direction of the license a bit, going back to the GBC roots, but ishurt by weak presentation and a lack of battery save. Sound and graphics are average at best, but sufferswhen compared to Need for Speed Underground 2. It is obvious this was meant to be a budget title, using a small cart size and no battery.  The game might appeal to younger fans of the Hot Wheels license, but it won't satisfy the average pocket gamer.  If a top tier racing game featuring the Hot Wheels cars is what you are looking for, you can find it in the used section at your local GameStop under the name Hot Wheels: Burnin' Rubber.", "date": "Feb 15, 2005"}
