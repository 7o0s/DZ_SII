Be it from a lack of sleep, leaning into a big turn in your favorite racer and falling out of your chair, getting in a fist fight over the last free controller, or refusing to stop in the middle of a 4/4 tie in a best of 5 match of Soul Calibur for the violent thunderstorm outside your bedroom window, there's more than one way to put the hurt on yourself via video gaming.  I've experienced all of the above at least once, but my personal favorite and perhaps the most common video gaming injury, would have to be a malady induced by severe button-bashing, the blister.  Ah yes, chronic gamer's thumb.  Before Crazy Taxi, I can't remember the last time I played a game 'till my thumbs hurt.  After Crazy Taxi, however, I was hard-pressed to ever recall a time where my entire hand hurt.  Moreover, I am quite certain I can't recall a time where I was in that much pain and decided that just ~one more game~ couldn't make things any worse...  And the thing is, severe Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and a touch of Gamer's Arthritis aside, I couldn't have called this one any clearer from a gameplay standpoint if I had a crystal ball.  Crazy Taxi was born for your Dreamcast, gang, and if you have one ounce of gaming appreciation in your bodies, you'll skip the rest of this rant and go directly to your nearest retailer and pick it up.  On the other hand, if you're a skeptic who's had the misfortune of being influenced by various reports that would be so naive as to label the game ~simple~ and ~repetitive,~ allow me a few quick moments to open up your mind to the gaming brilliance that is Crazy Taxi.  Choose you driver, hop in your convertible cab and hit the road.  Engine roaring; tear through the hills of fictitious cities while dodging traffic, cable cars, people and time. Power slide through turns, jump off cliffs and out of parking garages, and test the limits of your reflexes to become the ultimate Crazy Cabbie.  Oh yes, this game will try the limits of both you nerve and gaming ability.  Put simply, CT is quite possibly the most deceptively complex title I have ever played from a gameplay standpoint.  As you progress through the game's ratings scale by picking up and delivering passengers as quickly as possible, you will slowly but surely realize that there is much, much more to the game than getting from point a to b.  In the control scheme, Crazy Taxi has managed to create an innovative system not unlike the best console fighters in that it is both demanding and dynamic enough to make every single gaming experience one that will both challenge and reward you in ways that will quickly remind you why video games are so much fun.  In fact, we'd go so far as to say that the game's control is a bit better in the home version than in the arcade.  ~Crazy~ combos are much easier to pull off with a controller from a physical standpoint, and moving your taxi in and out of traffic is much more user friendly than using the analog stick than the arcade version, much less the steering wheels we tried out.  Mash a button to slam on the gas for a ~Crazy Dash,~ lay down on the breaks and pop it in to reverse with the accelerator floored to execute that all important ~Crazy Stop,~ or bust a few ~Crazy Throughs~ in-between oncoming traffic in route to a crucial ~Crazy Drift~ that gives you the perfect angle to drop on passenger off curbside while simultaneously picking up the next fare.  It may not seem like much, but if you expect to get anywhere in this game, you'll have to get as good at precise execution of the game's vast control options as you are in any combo-heavy beat-em up.  We spent a good 8 hours just getting comfortable with the game, and a good 10 plus making sure we could have the rest of the office saying ~good god, that was awesome,~ and trust me when I tell ya, it was worth every minute.  The best part is, even after all that playtime, we're still learning.  How many games can you say that about?  A big part of our progression behind the wheel is due to the fantastic Dreamcast-exclusive mini-games which, though a bit on the trivial side, are absolutely perfect for showing you the ropes in your new ride.  Each game is designed to help you perfect a new ~Crazy~ technique, and after countless hours opening up all the hidden games in the ~Crazy Box,~ we were finally able to take to the streets in earnest.  Not only that, but they tended to be pretty damn funny.  Wait 'till you see the old ladies.  It will have you rolling.  Actually, the visual side of Crazy Taxi will solicit much more than laughter.  The game moves at an amazing clip, and though the beta we received had occasional slowdown, the final is almost unbelievably smooth.  At 60 FPS, Taxi flies by at an alarming rate, and it is in this speed that its frantic pace comes to life.  No game of this nature has ever been this fast, and no title before it has ever been this environmentally random.  Sure, we've seen traffic in the likes of Driver and NFS, but the city environments in Crazy Taxi are boiling over with life in the form of thick traffic and countless potential customers.   Sparks fly, phone booths crumble under-tire, pedestrians dive out of the way, cars flip..you'll see it all in Taxi and thanks to the game's amazing visuals, all will want to see it, as well.  I can't recall the last time a game has drawn in this many on-lookers, much less the last time this many non-gamers simply had to put down their work and give it a go.  Everyone from Accounting to the fun-deprived Power Students had a sit-down with this game, and the mass of addicts often exceeded 10 or more eager gamers.  Remember that this in an office where the majority of the people play games for a living! If you're looking for a show-pony for your new console, this is an unquestionably good choice.  More importantly, if you're looking for a game that packs an almost infinite supply of replayability, Crazy Taxi knows how to deliver.  Though many were concerned that an arcade title such as this would have trouble when making the transition to the Dreamcast, Taxi comes through in a major way.  As I said earlier, the mini-games are awesome, and the DC exclusive track?  Possibly better than the arcade track. The fact that you have to be one hell of a driver to get to the top of the ~money list~ on either course will easily keep you busy for a good 30-40 hours.  Not to mention that beating your records in CT is the most competitive single-player experience since the original Wipeout.  It's just the type of game you can set down for a few days and instantly come back and be as into it as you were the first time you got that S-license.  Let me put it to you this way:  Updating this site the last week has been absolute hell for no other reason than the fact that I had to stop playing Crazy Taxi to give you guys the goods.  I could not put it down.  I dreamed about the best routes to the Pizza Hut, for crying out loud!  This game will consume you, and you'll love every minute of it.   Aside from the spotless control and awesome visuals, the presentation in Crazy Taxi is quite cool.  The level design is absolutely spectacular, and both maps will floor you with their level of detail and ingenuity.  The soundtrack has managed to make its way home from the arcades intact, and nothing seems more fitting than the tunes of The Offspring and Bad Religion while you're practicing a little road rage.  The sound is also top notch, with a host of voice samples.  Though with this type of game, you'll hear a lot of the same stuff, the samples don't get old easily and we're still hearing new ones.  Our favorites right now are the priest who tells you ~you're one hell of a driver~ and the valley girl who says you're ~hella fast.~  Cracks me up.  Passengers will comment on your skills, and if you're too out of control, will whine and complain.  It is pretty funny, and certainly helps to keep you focused.  Overall, the audio package is one of the best for an arcade driving game we've ever seen.  In all fairness, however, all this praise comes with a few quirks.  The engine contains a bit too much pop-up for its own good, as you can sometimes go so fast that you slam into a car that wasn't onscreen an instant before when going down a steep hill.  By the same token, the Dreamcast-original track, which although it is a lot more open than the arcade track, seems much less polished.  Though it doesn't really effect gameplay on this course, pop-up is a much more consistent problem here. But my real issue with this level is the directional arrow.  Taxi uses a green arrow to tell you where to go with each fare, and the original mode has a bad habit of pointing in the location of the destination, rather than the next turn you should make, as in the arcade mode.  I had a major problem with this fundamental shift in gameplay dynamics for quite some time, and until you learn the layout of the original track, you will find yourself getting screwed a few times too many by the evil arrow.  The fact is, even without this, the new track is much more challenging, and it is almost as if this was more of an advanced mode for expert drivers.  I think the game would have been bettered served to hide this new track for those who beat the Arcade track, and then the added demand would seem a bit more appropriate.  As it stands now, it can be really frustrating for beginners, and until you know your way around, you may find yourself hating the original track.  Stick with it though, as it is easily as good, if not better than the arcade, and is well worth the time.   And that's the thing about Crazy Taxi.  It may seem a bit shallow or short-lived at first, but the more I played it, the more I wanted to play it. It is the closest thing to a digital drug we have ever seen.  Think of it as gaming crack.  At first, you'll try it at a friend's house cause he lets you give it a free spin.  Then you go buy your own pipe.  The next thing you know, you're skipping work to take ~just one more hit.~  All of the sudden, you get fired for too many absences, you sell everything you own to sustain your habit, and you're living in filth because all thoughts of daily hygiene and personal wellness come in a distant second to your new fix.  Ah yes, there is nothing quite like picking up a game and realizing after a what seems like a few minutes that you just spent the last 7 hours trying to get just $1,000 more so you can get the coveted ~Crazy License.~  Playing Crazy Taxi not only reminded me of why I love games but why I believe Sega has some of the most talented designers and developers in the history of gaming.  As a game whose greatness is matched only by the gaming ecstasy known as Soul Calibur, this is a must-have title for any Dreamcast owner.  For that matter, it is the type of game that would easily justify a system purchase for the stragglers.  So do yourself a favor, hang the fuzzy dice in the mirror, and get behind the wheel with amazing arcade translation.  You won't regret it.  -- Brandon Justice, IGNDC Crazy Taxi is an awesome game if you didn't play it on previous systems. Don't let its original 1998 release sway you from picking it up for GameCube if you haven't played it before. Chances are you've heard good things about it and now you can enjoy it on a Nintendo system. Even better, the controller is especially comfortable for the game, which requires a lot of button mashing. If you have played Crazy Taxi before or already own it there's very little reason to pick it up on GameCube unless you're looking to waste money. It's the same experience for the price of a new GameCube title.", "date": "Jan 29, 2000"}
