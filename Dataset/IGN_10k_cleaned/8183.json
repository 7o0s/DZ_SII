Whether you're trudging across ancient Egyptian landscapes, through twisted circus zones or along the candle-lit corridors of Dracula's castle itself, you can't help but feel totally absorbed in Portrait of Ruin's whip-flinging, monster-mashing gameplay. And, as the body count increases, it's apparent this latest entry in the Castlevania series is one of the DS's most action-packed and brutally satisfying title yet.   However, like fellow zombie-slasher Dead Rising, there's a moment a few hours into the game where you'll start to wonder if there's anything more to Portrait of Ruin than mindlessly slaying endless waves of the undead. Thankfully the answer is yes - with a hint of no. You see, when Portrait of Ruin gets things right, which it frequently does, it's an absolute rollercoaster (or should that be ghost train?) of a ride. Battling screen-filling bosses is always intense and exciting, as is discovering new, outrageously powerful special moves. But on the flipside there are moments where you'll wish ol' Big Teeth would get it over and done with pronto, so you don't have to waste time slogging through tedious sub-quests and fighting what seems like millions of respawning bad guys, just to level up.     Despite these dips in gameplay, Portrait of Ruin is a killer title and one that stands proud as a shining addition to the Castlevania collection. Admittedly it's not as good as the previous DS Castlevania incarnation Dawn of Sorrow, but it does some things better, like dispensing with the pointless touchscreen sections at the end of boss battles. However, the 'Metroid-vania' sense of exploration that made DoS so enjoyable is sadly missing from this considerably more linear sequel. Shame.    As for the game itself, Castlevania's trademark bat-slapping, skeleton-bashing gameplay is still very much intact, but now there are two characters dishing out the death. Joanthan Morris is a close-combat specialist who excels at getting stuck in while spell caster Charlotte Aulin is better at hanging back and dispatching with enemies from afar using magic. Players can control the two either individually, fighting as one while the other provides AI back-up, or they can combine forces to really lay the boot in. While the dual character system works well, mainly because you can wade through enemies in half the time, it's never an essential part of the gameplay and occassionally feels far too superfluous for its own good. True, some puzzles require players to use Jonathan and Charlotte together - like standing on a switch to enable the other to walk through a gate - but they're often clumsily implemented and feel forced, like shoving a melon through a letterbox.   However, a new feature that does work well is the inclusion of portraits. Although you do spend a fair amount of time exploring Dracula's castle, it's really just a hub that contains four portraits leading off to different realms. Each has its own distinctive style: the gothic town is plagued by ghouls while the pyramid is infested with mummies that ensnare our intrepid duo with bandages; the haunted forest is packed with possessed animals and finally there's the freak show, which is enough to give anyone with a fear of clowns nightmares for a week. Players access these areas by jumping through the portraits and, once the boss for each area has been defeated, warp back to the castle before progressing to the next painting.     While the portraits have enabled Konami to flex its creative muscle and break out of the traditional Castlevania settings, the downside is that they hamper a lot of the freedom to explore which made Dawn of Sorrow so great. Indeed, the feeling of accomplishment that came from gaining a new ability, enabling you to reach previously inaccessible areas of the castle, is pretty much gone. Instead the focus is much more on combat, with exploration taking a back seat.   That said, the combat is superb and there are some truly fantastic set-pieces to get stuck into. What's more, every time you venture into a new area you're never quite sure what to expect: there could just be a handful of bats lurking in the shadows, or you might be greeted by a bloody great knight who's trying to lop your head off. Not knowing what's coming next means the game always feels fresh and, more importantly, there's always a challenge to tackle. Learning how to fight effectively - getting in a sly strike before dodging the counter - takes genuine skill, and while leveling up involves a certain amount of 'grinding' it's never really a chore, thanks to PoR's wonderfully over-the-top weapons, such as the homing whip and six-foot Claymore sword.    There's more to Portrait of Ruin than swords and slaying too. Take the slightly (and we mean slightly) more cerebral sub-quests. Early in the adventure a restless spirit named Wind offers you the chance to earn new items and abilities, by completing challenges he sets. Some are simple, like killing a certain number of enemies or performing a particular move, while others involve searching through the levels for a specific item or bad guy. Often you're forced to return to areas you've already explored, which helps to break up the linearity of the main quest. However, some of the tasks are unreasonably difficult, requiring players to revisit a random location they visited much earlier in the game. It wouldn't be so bad if the rewards for completing these side quests weren't so great but many of the items you receive are essential for killing the bigger bad guys later in the game.    Thankfully there's a co-op mode where you and a mate can team up and practice your giant-killing skills against the game's various boss monsters. Although having the option to play through the entire game in co-op would've been great, with one player controlling Jonathan and the other Charlotte, it's still a neat addition. There's also a bonus mode waiting for anyone who beats the game and gets the 'good' ending. Although we won't spoil the surprise, it's a fantastic extra that Castlevania fans will lap up.Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin isnt the mind-blowing revelation that Dawn of Sorrow was but its still an extremely solid and enjoyable experience. Playing with two characters is a nice addition to the series, as is the online play and some of the sub-quests. What's more, while PoR lacks a lot of the freedom of Dawn of Sorrow, the epic boss fights and refined combat system really makes up for it. A host of great extras and unlockables, as well as multiple endings, finishes off the package perfectly and makes Portrait of Ruin a title than can sit proudly alongside the best of the Belmonts.", "date": "Mar 7, 2007"}
