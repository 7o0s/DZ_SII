(Plus, Monster Rancher is no rip-off.) With its cute, nearly unlimited characters, involving gameplay, and an easy-to-use combat system, Monster Rancher 2 will please both owners of the original and newcomers.   You don't necessarily have to pick a Swayzo, since there are almost 400 characters from which to pick. And unlike other virtual pet games Monster Rancher gives your creatures attitudes and feelings, instead of just ~beeping~ at you. Monsters will cry, play with you, try new foods, and even try and cheat at training sessions. What really differentiates Monster Rancher from the any other game of its ilk, is the variety and depth of each monster, and the unique battle system that helps to raise it to adulthood.  Gameplay First of all, Tecmo has brought each monster to life in its own unique way. The monsters show a lot more emotion and demonstrate far more animations than in the previous game. For example, when you feed your Swayzo food, instead of just smiling, he will actually stick out his tongue and catch the food in mid-air. Your monsters oftentimes give you gifts (if you treat it nicely) or get angry (if dealt with in too strict a manner). Even though this game is deeper with emotion and interaction, the first Monster Rancher was more simplistic, and provided an easier learning curve. And the new attitudes often make monsters too lazy to lift a tendril, often requiring a harsher approach. But the trade off is worth it because while you give up simplicity, you gain complexity in the interactions with your creature, creating stronger bonds, a wider range of interactions, and a deeper game overall.   Still, Monsters will wander around the ranch and periodically make random noises while you're sitting and watching, and often fall asleep in the middle of work, that is, unless you train them well. Sometimes they're just fun to sit around and watch.   When you first get your monster (I suggest buying them from the market at the beginning of the game), it's a good idea to get accustomed to it, an integral part of training. With the addition of quest-like training sessions, called Errantries, training is much more involved, requires more time, and provides results that are far more spectacular than in Monster Rancher. In the original, there were more ways to train your monster, but few ways to teach it new attacks. Monster Rancher 2 is the opposite. By sending monsters on Errantries and into battles, it gains experience in fights and by exploring new lands, enabling it to learn a massive amount of attacks.   Errantries initially seem like your monster is being send to boarding school and is soon to be under the control of a strict schoolmaster with a 10-foot ruler behind his desk. The face of the Errantry master that appears on screen and the tone of his voice may make one think twice about ever sending a monster on a single Errantry. But, of course, the steep fee ($2,000 gold) is worth it. Monsters gain massive amounts of experience and almost always learn new attacks. For example, I sent my Swayzo (Bob!) to the jungle land where he was chased by a monkey, maneuvered through a maze, and was forced to find his way out of a cave filled with boulders. In total, he gained 28 intelligence points, 24 speed points, and a new attack called Toxic Gas. Oh, and Bob earned all this for only $1,000 because I went during a discount month. Not a bad deal at all. So, monsters don' have to lose in battles new to gain more experience. Needless to say, Errantries are a nice addition.   Battles are the same as in the first game. You enter in to a tournament and are matched with several others, who are all roughly equal in experience. To battle, you can either help it, or simply watch it battle on its own. Its intelligence determines how well it fights on its own. With your help and by maneuvering the monster in for different ways (close, very close, medium, and far), you'll have control over the choice and frequency of attacks. Stats determine the other factors in the game. Battles were good the first time, and there are still good now. Graphics The first Monster Rancher was filled with 2D creatures, backgrounds and sprites, and often the sprites were very ugly ones indeed. But almost everything in Monster Rancher 2 is in 3D, making it look more polished and contemporary.   The monsters have changed rather significantly from the first Monster Rancher, too. There are the memorable cute ones from the first endeavor, but in MR2 the variety is now much greater because of the extraordinary quantity of evil, dark, and strange looking monsters that simply didn't exist in the first one. It's just filled with bizarre monsters, such as the FuzNubb, the Cockeye (a peacock Swayzo), and Aqua Moochi, which add to it graphic distinctiveness.   But despite a significant upgrade in the overall graphics in MR2, the game still isn't as shiny and new as the current crop of games. In comparison, it's simply OK looking. The palette is filled with primary colors. It's bright and kiddy, like Super Mario 64 in most places, which can get annoying, if you're paying attention. In addition, the backgrounds are uninspired. They're stiff looking and static. Thankfully the loading times are improved over the first game.  Sound The music in Monster Rancher 2 is not phenomenally distinctive. The music is rather repetitive, but it's average fare for this kind of game. Think of the music in terms of waves lapping against your feet, occasionally going way too far and drenching your shorts, but other times, just redundantly coaxing them to relax.   The monsters do sound very cute, and the little grunting and squealing noises are endearing. Moochi is adorably cute. In fact, he actually is one of the few characters who says his own name. If you have seen the cartoon, you know what I mean. Monster Rancher 2 is a great game and anyone who enjoyed the first one should snap this one up as soon as possible. It's important to know that for those who do own the first game, your monsters are compatible and can be converted into this game too, a great technical gift from the folks at Temco. We highly recommend it.", "date": "Oct 8, 1999"}
