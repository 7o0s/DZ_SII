Most of them were first party titles  games like Ice Climber, Excitebike and Super Mario Bros. Games that had been developed in-house by Nintendo's own teams in Japan. But two of the 18 were outsiders  10-Yard Fight and Kung Fu. They were brought to market and published by the Big N, but they'd been developed by a much smaller company. A company called Irem.   It was a rarity in those days to see Nintendo taking an interest in and promoting titles that hadn't been created by Nintendo itself  Irem enjoyed a special position of privilege at a significant turning point in industry history. They capitalized on their station a few years later, taking advantage of Nintendo's brand and racetrack logo to draw attention to their first major arcade effort  R-Type. Nintendo published the coin-op R-Type cabinet in America in 1987, and Irem had arrived. R-Type was a hit. With spectacular graphics, inventive gameplay and the right balance of challenge, the game quickly found a dedicated audience of fans.   R-Type is a side-scrolling shooter. Similar in ways to other games in the genre, like Konami's Gradius, but also totally unique in many aspects. R-Type's pace is more casual than other shooters. The stages forcibly scroll to the right, nothing new there, but the scroll is slower. It's less frantic. More methodical.   R-Type isn't a game where you're meant to blast away every baddie on the screen. You can play that way, sure. But you'll have more success in playing it like a game of survival  memorizing enemies' flight paths, finding the patterns in their attacks. There's more strategy involved here than you'd first expect, and strategizing becomes especially important in balancing your ship's power-ups.   The Force is R-Type's signature weapon. It's a floating, fighting pod that can be attached to the front or rear of your ship, and can also be launched across the screen with a button press. A second button press recalls the orb, making effective Force management an exercise in juggling the pod between your craft's fore and aft, and sending it out alone like a boomeranging satellite. The pod can be powered up with a variety of different beams, including forward-firing energy waves and angled lasers that bounce and ricochet off walls. Your arsenal is rounded out by some Gradius-esque other power-ups, like speed boosters and auto-firing missiles.   Level design is varied and unique, some stages a significant departure from established shoot-'em-up conventions. Stage 3, for example, is one huge boss fight against a battle cruiser that fills up 10 full screens. And that's just one of the many mammoth challenges to overcome in R-Type  this game is truly difficult, even to the point of being frustrating. Gamers new to the shooter genre would be better advised to start off with some other companies' series first, graduating to Irem's efforts only when they're prepared for a more demanding design.   This version of R-Type is an emulation of the TurboGrafx-16 edition of the game. The TG16 version was itself a near-perfect port of the Nintendo-published arcade original, so there's little compromise made in graphics, sound or any other area. The only real let-down about R-Type is that it never came to a Nintendo home system, years ago. After using Nintendo as their publisher for the coin-op version, Irem snubbed the Big N by producing this edition for Hudson's TurboGrafx. They even made a port for Sega's 8-bit Master System, but never the NES or SNES. That makes this Virtual Console release the first time the original R-Type has arrived on a Mario-approved machine. It took a while. But we're happy to have it.    R-Type's the first game to break the established VC pricing structure  it costs 800 Wii Points, 200 more than other TurboGrafx-16 titles. That's because we in the States are getting the full R-Type, including all eight levels. Japanese Wii owners have to make two separate purchases to get the full game  R-Type Part 1 and R-Type Part 2, each containing only four stages of play, and each priced at 600 Wii Points. It's a weird arrangement, but it reflects how R-Type was originally released in Japan years ago, spread across two separate game cards. Feel free to pick your perspective on the price. Either we Americans are getting a deal because the game effectively costs 400 Points less for us than in Japan, or we're getting screwed because it's the only Turbo title that's priced above the 600 level. Confused? That's Irem for ya.", "date": "Jan 13, 2007"}
