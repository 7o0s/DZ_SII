When I saw this box sitting on Tal's desk with the words ~Avalon Hill~ and ~Squad Leader~ plastered across the front, I was on it quicker than Bill Clinton on an intern. Many years ago I spent countless hours pushing little cardboard squares around in the classic Avalon Hill boardgame of the same name, and so with the warm glow of nostalgia hitting me like George W. Bush's whiskey-drenched breath at a sobriety checkpoint, I volunteered to do the review.  After all, as my stupid malfunctioning brain reasoned at the time, they've made decent computer translations of Risk and Axis & Allies, so why not bring back another classic? Sure, the Close Combat series is in many ways Squad Leader for the PC, but after five iterations that one's at least as old as Bob Dole, and it would be nice to see another take on the original design, maybe even a turn-based one.  What the hell was I thinking? If I had even bothered to follow the development of this game as closely as Al Gore did his pet project, the Internet (okay, okay no more Election Day jokes), I would have been adequately warned away.  Warned of what? Simple answer: Random Games and their horrible, horrible Soldiers at War engine.   The Little Engine that Wouldn't Die...  Long ago, way before the IGN network was conceived at some sinister Stonecutter's meeting, I did a magazine review of this game called Soldiers at War. Darn it, I wanted to like that game -- it was a lot like X-Com and Jagged Alliance, in that it was a turn-based, squad-level tactical thing in which you guided a bunch of guys through combat around some isometric maps. Plus it had the added bonus of being about World War II (remember, this was well before Saving Private Ryan, and games about WWII that were not obscure little hexagon, flat-counter wargames were few and far between).  Well I don't remember what score I gave Soldiers at War, but I'm still haunted by its vast black patches of terrain where missing elevations were supposed to be and its pixilated enemies that popped in and out of the map like some kind of weird ghostly gun-toting groundhogs. Playing that game was like fighting in some bizarre, Doctor Strange-type landscape where the normal laws of physics didn't apply: in this magical place, there were four distinct spatial dimensions, allowing enemies to be seen through vast chunks of terrain but not shot at, while time itself had been stretched out into immense, turn-based chunks. It could take hours for six guys to navigate across a single city block.  Skip ahead to about two years ago, when I reviewed Warhammer: Chaos Gate for IGN. It used an improved engine and was dressed up in fancy Warhammer outfits with lots of cool sound effects and psionic super-powers, but it still had that same wacky MC Escher version of reality. It was fun, but in retrospect I probably rated Chaos Gate a little too highly, as I've never had the least bit of interest in playing the game since.  I certainly never thought I would be tricked into playing it again.   War is a turn-based hell  Which brings us to today and this mislabeled, outdated, sad little affair. It's unconscionable that six years after the first X-COM, subsequent outings can't even master such fundamental basics as depicting a multi-level isometric landscape without driving users hopelessly insane and giving them mouse-related repetitive stress injuries to boot. Squad Leader doesn't even match its two year old predecessor, Chaos Gate. It has degenerated to Soldiers at War.  In X-COM, when you sent a soldier up a staircase, after two steps the engine painlessly presents you with the upstairs view. In Squad Leader, the same action becomes impossibly convoluted since there are ten, ten different levels of elevation, and inevitably some wall or tree is in the way.  X-COM featured eminently destroyable terrain; here, not even a bazooka can take a chunk out of a wall. But most baffling of all, Squad Leader is singularly unable to depict just what the hell is going on during the AI's turn. You'll see soldiers fire at you, then the camera pans so fast you can't tell where it's coming from, they'll appear then disappear in seconds, it's all so herky-jerky you'll cry. Yet when it's your turn again, your guys move so slowly you'll gather moss just sitting there waiting for them to finish. Nor do the terrain graphics give you any indication of what terrain level you're on or what you can walk through and what is impassible. The mouse cursor won't even line up on the proper grid square half the time.  In fairness, there are some good touches, but they're few and far between. The grenades work; they're fun to use, which is good. Most important was the fact that soldiers can actually get on their bellies and crawl, or fire from a prone position, and the inclusion of the somewhat drivable if improbably ponderous vehicles is an improvement over earlier outings. Hasbro makes a big deal about the ~letters from home~ thing on its website and some of the interviews I read (so I did a little research), which is supposed to personalize them as good news or bad news can affect a soldier's morale in a coming battle. Okay that's cute if obviously ripped from Private Ryan but hardly merits even a bullet point, let alone the focus of an entire interview.  But there's no multiplayer (which Chaos Gate had, the graphics are ugly and confusing, the soldiers are indistinct bundles of statistics (despite the silly biographies and custom faces each has), and the only time you're ever going to be surprised is when the game suddenly locks up and crashes, seemingly at random.  Random Games indeed.  The End  Enough about this dated game and Random Games' flirtations with adequacy. Let's talk about what is really wrong with this picture, and what really cheesed me off so much in the first place: the deceptive marketing -- wait, let's be honest here -- the goddamn lying packaging.  This is in no shape, way or form Squad Leader as created by Avalon Hill. At least the old Avalon Hill. The ~new,~ employee-less Avalon Hill (basically just a game catalog) is now owned by Hasbro, and if the unthinking giant mega-corporation wants to forever trash the good name of Avalon's most valuable, flagship property, one of the most important wargames in the history of the hobby, by pushing out some sub-standard, unrelated, relabeled sequel -- all for the sake of cashing in on the Saving Private Ryan nostalgia ~craze~ (notice how the stock photograph used on the box happens to have a guy that kind of looks like Matt Damon) in some, last desperate bid to make a buck for what has been a lackluster, underperforming division -- so lackluster they're trying to sell the whole unit -- then there's a not damn thing you, or I, or the entire gaming community can do about it.  Except loudly, pointedly, and conspicuously refuse to buy this game or have anything to do with it.  Well, here's another scary thought. Hasbro also owns MicroProse, who owns X-COM. Thankfully they've been so woefully mismanaged that it doesn't look like they'll ever get the opportunity to crank out a mediocre turn-based X-COM sequel using the Soldiers at War engine.  --Jason Bates", "date": "Nov 8, 2000"}
