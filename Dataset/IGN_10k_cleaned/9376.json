{"name": "VR Soccer '96", "name_review": "VR Soccer", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/27/vr-soccer", "text": "VR Soccer features 44 International Teams that you can compete in friendly, tournament, league, or cup matches. There's also realistic-sounding commentary and some great goal celebrations. These days, though, these features are all part and parcel to your average soccer game. VR Soccer, however, makes it work.  Firstly, the graphics are absolutely stunning. The players consist of real polygons and smooth texture-mapped uniforms and faces which add a great deal of realism to the graphic presentation. The entire stadiums, from crowds to chants, are all done very well. The control is also nice. Each player can head, bicycle kick, drop pass, and curve a goal in from the corner. The defense is a little lacking in the one-player mode, so games tend to be a little too easy.  It's not the best soccer game ever, but VR Soccer is definitely worth checking out.
