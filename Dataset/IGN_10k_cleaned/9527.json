Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/15/bulldozer-inc-review", "text": "As a kid you played with Tonka trucks, stacking up piles of Lincoln Logs or toy dolls that you stole from your sister. With a maniacal look in your young eye, you'd send your toy truck through your pile with the finesse of your drunk neighbor trying to mow his lawn at three in the morning while wearing a bee keepers mask. I hate my neighbor.   Bulldozer Inc. brings back the memories of your destructive childhood ways with a colorful and addictive action puzzler.   Two game modes, Standard and Rampage test your bulldozing and time management skills. These skills may come in handy in real world environments when you're walking around a fenced in guarded construction site and the foreman is frantically searching for a tough and rugged individual with experience in plowing thru buildings while avoiding human beings and collecting power ups. And people think video games are a waste of time...   Standard mode offers 30 levels of carnage -- simply destroy buildings in the time allotted. You can safely plow small chunks of the building which leaves less rubble but is a slower process. Or you can gain some speed and charge right into the middle of a building, taking the chance of destroying yourself in the process. Dynamite can be pushed close to a building and has a fast counting timer, allowing you to get away before it goes off. Gas tanks can be crushed and have a larger explosion radius so make sure you're far enough away after you've damaged them. Use these devices to help quickly bring down buildings. Rampage mode is the same game but has only 15 levels and no time limit.    You have three bulldozers to choose from, but you must unlock two of them by scoring enough points in Standard game mode. Razor is your default one, with average abilities. The easier to damage Sprinter bulldozer is faster and can plow through walls easier but is only accessible after scoring 500,000 points. Goliath is the grand-daddy of dozers and is available after scoring 800,000 points. You earn an extra bulldozer every 100,000 points. Points are deducted if you accidentally destroy a building not marked for destruction. I recommend avoiding those. (Just a friendly pro-tip.) A small square appears in the upper corner acting as a mini-map of sorts. Green squares are the buildings you want to destroy. Red squares are ones to avoid damaging.   Bonus levels show up about every five stages or so offering you a chance to collect money in a limited amount of time. Don't get too happy though, because the humans are also running around getting in your way. Crush a gas tanker and watch your bonus level end when it kills half the people on the map. You can earn some good cash in the bonus levels but you have to do it carefully and continually blow your horn like a lonely old man passing the high school cheerleading squad practice.   The biggest challenge to the game isn't destroying the buildings; it's trying not to kill the humans running around on the map. Not only are they everywhere, but they're really, really stupid and will stand at places where they can easily be killed. Knock off five humans after a gas tank explodes and watch your timer get cut in half. It's frustrating, but you do have a horn you can blow to scare them off. Blowing your horn before knocking down a building alerts any workers inside and they'll leave the building quickly before you tear it down. Humans are crucial in keeping alive because in the later stages of the game you'll need all the time you can get. Not only do you have to knock down more and more buildings each map, but they get progressively taller and bigger as well. It takes a lot of time tearing one down unless you go gung-ho and plow right into the middle of it risking one of your lives.    Lucky for you there are a few power ups that will help you along your way. Dollar signs earn you a $2,000 bonus. The Dozer Blade tears down walls quickly. Nitro lets you crush right through a building. Wrenches repair damage. Watches give you bonus time. Spheres turn your bulldozer invincible, which is both a blessing and a curse. With the limited amount of time some power ups provide you, you'll be hell bent on destroying everything in your way but you may accidentally run over a few dumb humans standing around. I would have liked to have been able to scan over the entire map before a level began to plan my strategy a bit better.    Graphics are bright and colorful and the bulldozer looks pretty cool. I would have liked a bit more variety in the type of buildings you destroy but maybe they're saving the shopping malls and 7-11's for a sequel. What's disappointing is the sound effects are too tinny (Not tiny. Tinny. It really is a word, I looked it up!). When I'm in a bulldozer knocking down buildings I want my phone to be so annoyingly loud with exploding sound effects it'll cause small children's noses too bleed.  I was really surprised at how addicting this game was. I really enjoyed the challenge of trying to complete the levels in time while avoiding the idiot humans running around. Even after dying at the 29th level, I picked it right back up and started over again determined to get a higher score. One of my favorite puzzle games of the year? Maybe. Or maybe I just miss my Tonka trucks.", "date": "Nov 15, 2007"}
