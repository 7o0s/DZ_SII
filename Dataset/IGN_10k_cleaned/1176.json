If you were one of the lucky console owners who bought the game, you probably can't forget it. Developed by Japanese Camelot Software Planning, the cartoony mascot-based title took inspiration from the company's previous release Hot Shots Golf (Review: 8.0, IGNPSX) and injected a new level of intuitive controls, tight graphics and polished design. The formula certainly worked, because Mario Golf is still a system favorite and one of the best golf games to grace any home platform.Introducing Mario Tennis -- the latest sporting effort from Camelot Software Planning and easily the company's most ambitious and addictive game to date. Mario and more than a dozen classic Nintendo mascot buddies take to the tennis courts for this one, which like Mario Golf before it features simplistic graphics, and a refreshingly fast arcade-style mixed with some deep control mechanics that you're bound to overlook if you don't pay attention. Mario Tennis delivers a solid single-player experience with lots of hidden secrets to keep you coming back for more, but it's the title's unsurpassed multiplayer experience that immortalizes it as one of the best games you can get for your Nintendo 64.Features Mario and friends challenge players to a friendly match of tennis Created by the same company behind 1999's Mario Golf Four-player can enjoy practice, sets, tournaments, challenge modes and more Simple, yet realistic play control -- mix your game up with long lobs, volleys, backhands blasts, and varying degrees and styles of spin 16 playable characters including Mario, Luigi, Toad, Princess, Bowser, Baby Mario, Waluigi and more -- all with unique attributes of power, speed, control and spin Original courts and power-up weapons Brutally fast gameplayGameplayMario Tennis may be overflowing with fluffy Nintendo mascots, cute color schemes and catch phrases like, ~Here-a-we-go-a!~ but with that said Camelot Planning has done a great job of staying true to the rules of the real sport. Adorable, cuddly characters -- more than 16 familiar faces in all (plus several new newbies acquired through the GB Transfer Pak) -- compete in your standard Tournament and Exhibition modes complete with multiple sets, singles, and doubles play. The regulations are all spot-on with the real thing, right down to the fact that the out-of-bounds lines change depending on whether or not you play the singles or doubles modes and if you fault twice on a serve you give up a point to your opponent.But that doesn't mean there isn't a bit of Fantasy Land sprinkled in for good measure too, because there definitely is. While most of the basic tennis rules remain the same, other gameplay modes include everything from Ring Shot (you must try to hit the tennis ball through rings suspended over the court and win the match against your opponent too; otherwise you get no ring points) to Piranha Challenge (piranha plants hurl a barrage of tennis balls your way and you have to return them back; the problem is that you also have to deal with an opponent who tries to spike your shots right back at you!). You can even travel to Bowser's Castle, a teetering tennis court suspended over boiling lava and filled with transparent power-up boxes -- if you hit the ball through a box, you are given a special bonus attack which can be used against opponents.While all of the non-standard extra modes are welcomed good fun, they aren't nearly as organized or addictive as the Tournament and Exhibition modes (which can be played through again and again with different characters to unlock secrets), and in fact have a hard time competing with the bonus levels in Sega's Virtua Tennis (Review: 9.4, IGNDreamcast). Bowser's Stage in particular just doesn't come together as we hoped it would. The idea of carrying on a match while rocketing turtle shells and exploding lightning bolts at opponents sounds intriguing on paper, but more often than not we found ourselves growing weary of the mode in favor of a good old fashioned game of tennis.Camelot Software has kept the control scheme in Mario Tennis simple on the outside, but deep on the inside. What we mean by that is that it's entirely possible to pick this game up and jump right into the thick of it without really learning all of the subtle extra moves that more skilled players will spend time mastering. And it will feel great regardless. The play is fast, easy, and very intuitive.The analog stick controls our mascot tennis pros around the courts, while the A and B buttons do everything else. Normally the A button slices the ball and the B button gives it a top spin, but there is a whole lot more to it than that. It's possible to put more power behind a slice or top spin by simply pressing and holding the A or B button and then releasing when you come into contact with the ball. It works wonderfully, but there is a definite risk in the process: powering your shots paralyzes your character so that they can't move around the court. So, if you're powering up for a smashing return and your opponent decides to send the ball on the opposite end of the court, you're probably pretty well screwed. The Z-trigger cancels your attempts at powering up, thus giving you control of your character again, but you'll almost never reach the opposite end of your court in time anyway to return the ball anyway. And so as you can tell, there is a strong play balance that must be obeyed if you're to have any hopes of competing; you're going to have to know when to power-up your shots and when to simply return the ball without the extra force. But there is more. Using a combination of A and B buttons, you can also spit out high lobs that soar over the heads' of opponents playing to close to the net. Or you can execute low drop shots that teeter over the net and fall to the ground, which almost always do in opponents playing the far back court. Again, though, you're going to have to intelligently decide when to use each method, as if you fail to send a lob over your opponent's head, for example, they can easily capitalize on it and return the ball with maximum force.And there is more. Each character in the game, from Mario to Donkey Kong Jr., from Birdo to Luigi, has their own unique attributes that really weigh into how they handle the courts. Luigi and Mario are all-around good players, for example, but they don't excel in any particular area. Meanwhile Baby Mario is super fast, Donkey Kong is incredibly powerful and Boo is able to put crazy spins on tennis balls that make their final landing spot almost impossible to predict. There is a different play strategy behind each character, honest, and so the mascots really do play into the overall balance and control of the entire game.All of the above comes together for what is easily one of the tightest, deceitfully deepest play mechanic setups in a long, long while; one that is overwhelmingly polished and addictive. Perhaps nothing can sum it up better than to simply say that Camelot absolutely nailed it.MultiplayerAs much as we enjoy the single-player experience to be had in Mario Tennis, there is no denying it -- this game is all about the multiplayer goodness. Call three of your friends over, pick your favorite characters, select a doubles match and go to town. You won't be able to put the controllers down -- we guarantee it. And the one-on-one action is just as satisfying. Take, for example, Matt Casamassina's recent encounter with editor Fran Mirabella below: Earlier today Fran Mirabella challenged me to several matches of multiplayer Mario Tennis and in doing so set a new record for all-time worst-crap-horribly-awful player. First he chose Mario and I picked Luigi. We hopped into one of the four readily selectable courts and began to play. It was embarrassing to the point where I actually began to pity poor Mirabella's ridiculously poor level of skill. I easily lobbed tennis balls by him in every direction, powered-up my shots and sent them whizzing by his head and even toyed with him for a bit by simply slicing drop shots over the net whenever I got the chance. I scored every single time. Mirabella would shout lies like, ~Damn controller!~ and ~Obviously Mario isn't a very balanced character,~ whenever he got the chance, but neither of us believed them. And unfortunately for Fran, it just kept getting worse. Bearing his name in mind, I repeatedly suggested that he try to use the Princess against me, but he wouldn't have it. And so during the next dozen or so matches, I played as Baby Mario and he as several different characters as he tried desperately to win to no avail. Finally, after much trash-talking and more excuses like, ~I wasn't paying attention!~ and ~I'm partially retarded,~ Mirabella gave up, totally and utterly defeated. Okay, that doesn't really tell you much more about the multiplayer mode other than the fact that Fran Mirabella sucks at it. The point is that because it's so intricately balanced and polished, it's like a videogame drug -- everyone at IGN stops by our area to play it and nobody wants to leave.GraphicsThe visuals that make up Mario Tennis are exactly as you might expect -- cute, cuddly, colorful and simplistic in a way that only Nintendo can pull off. All of the mascot characters are perfectly recreated and come to life with humorous tennis court animations (like diving for a ball or swinging their tennis rackets in disgust after missing a shot). There is a flashy particle system that allows for sparks and blue fire on balls, an instant replay mode that sees panning camera angles that zoom in and out of the action, and the framerate never, ever, ever suffers -- it's constantly smooth and blazing fast. Nothing is overly detailed, and in fact some of the background textures (like the crowd, for example) could do with a little work as they're repetitive and blurry, but as most of the action is focused on the courts themselves it's hardly a bother.SoundCamelot has really done well in bringing the personality of Nintendo's mascot characters to a tennis environment, and that is perhaps most evident in the use of great sound lines. Mario is always spouting off with his traditional, ~It's-a-[insert whatever here]~ and ~Momma-mee-a!~ while bigger characters like Donkey Kong let out the standard apish roar when they win a set. But these sounds and one-liners are commonplace in regular tennis matches. After every return you can hear a ~Yahoo!~ or a ~Yeah!~ or something of that nature, which, coupled with the rest of the effects that include everything from thumping feet to bouncing ball sounds, just sort of click right into the environment. The musical selection, meanwhile, is standard, happy tree-fruit stuff that will keep the matches cheery, but you'll hardly notice it through the ongoing mess of other noises.Developer Camelot proved that it knew how to take classic Nintendo mascots and deliver them into a great sports title when it shipped Mario Golf last year. But the company has really outdone itself with Mario Tennis, one of the most polished games to ever grace Nintendo's 64-bit console. The title, which features more than 16 classic mascot characters and realistic tennis rules and physics, plus more bonus modes than you can shake a stick at and an unsurpassed multiplayer mode, is so difficult to put down that there really is no use in trying. But even if you can find the willpower to take a break from the action, you'll keep coming back for more as you try and unlock all of the secret characters and arenas in the single-player mode, and once  you're done with that it's time to call all of your buddies over and let loose. Just make sure you've got some comfortable chairs because you and your friends are going to be playing for a long, long while.Wholeheartedly recommended.", "date": "Aug 19, 2000"}
