On any given outing, there's a good chance you'll get cooked to a crisp by the blistering sun and return home at the end of the day with nothing to show for your trouble. But the sheer adrenaline rush of hooking and landing a monster tuna, sailfish, blue marlin, or even a shark is so powerful and addictive that it's worth every second of boredom and pain you had to endure.  The same can't be said of Deep Sea Trophy Fishing, though. Created by the same development team that burdened fresh-water anglers with the dreadful Pro Bass Fishing, Deep Sea Trophy Fishing tests your patience from the first cast -- but unlike real deep sea fishing, you'll never feel for a second that your efforts have been rewarded.  Deep Sea Trophy Fishing fails in every department, from its uninspired graphics to its vacuous, mind-numbing, pointless gameplay. Every excursion follows the same boring routine: pick a boat, choose your bait (based on the type of fish you're after, which in turn is largely determined by the boat you selected), toss some chum, cast the line, and catch a fish. And in a cruel twist of fate, hooking a really big one is the greatest torture of all -- it means you'll spend five, six, or seven minutes simply holding the mouse button to reel it in. Sure, you've got to keep an eye on the line tension so your fish doesn't snap the line, but you'll master that little challenge in about 30 seconds.  What's most amazing to me about Deep Sea Trophy Fishing is just how little effort was put into its creation. There are four boats to choose from, but the only visual difference between them is a crappy sign slapped on the stern; in fact, there are only five or six different screens in the whole game. Sound effects are equally sparse: the hum of the engine, the annoying screech of the reel, the clanking ring of a sea buoy, and the occasional squawk of a sea gull are pretty much all you'll hear during your outings. On the front of the box is a picture of a sports fisherman strapped into a chair as he reels in his catch -- but in the game all you see is a fuzzy digitized image of a guy standing at the back of the boat. Yeah, I'd like to see someone standing at the stern as they reel in a half-ton tiger shark....  You know a fishing simulation is dull when you're praying that the boat will founder so you can test your survival skills, or when you long for a sea-sickness option just to see your character do something other than jerk back and forth as he reels in a fish -- especially if your mind begins wandering down these bizarre paths after five or ten minutes of play.  Spend some time with Deep Sea Trophy Fishing, and you'll come to the conclusion that either the game is pathetic or the sport it simulates is utterly wretched -- and you can trust me when I say it's not the latter.  -- Chris Buckman", "date": "Sep 29, 1998"}
