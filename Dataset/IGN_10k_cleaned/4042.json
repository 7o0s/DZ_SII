Eighteen wheels are your weapon to clear your path of pesky police and badass bikers. Steer your rig through icy slopes, desert drives, and neon illuminated cities as you visit hot spots like Smokestack Heights or Skeeter's Creek.    While touring the country side, you and your three siblings are involved in a ~Trial by Truck'n.~ Ma's sick of the ol' hauling business, so she's retiring. She can't pick which of her charming offspring is qualified to take over ~Big Mutha Truckers,~ her trucking company, so whoever can make the most money in sixty days (so that she has a nice wad o' cash to retire with) gets the business. It's up to you to use you business smarts and your sharp reflexes to show Ma who really is her favorite child.   Gameplay  Big Mutha Truckers is 2/3 arcade trucking and 1/3 economic simulation. Anyone who has played Palm Pilot games like Space Trader or Drug Wars knows the supply and demand style gameplay you can expect to find in BMT. The difference is that not only is BMT in 3D, but you actually get to drive to your destination.    When you climb into a big rig of your very own (as one of the four Jacksons), you'll be surprised by the realism of the physics engine. Cars don't automatically fly into the air or blow up in a cloud of flames when you hit them (that takes several hits). Instead, most of them crunch up or are thrown into spins for short distances. Your trailer also behaves as you'd expect. Any sudden movements cause the trailer to swing across lanes. Take a corner too sharply and you'll spin out, which forces you to weave back and forth across the entire road in an attempt to regain control. This might not qualify as a realistic simulation of big rig driving, but it your truck behaves how you'd imagine it would.     You'll also have to watch out for truck jackers, police, and the ever present threat of running out of gas (your truck guzzles gas like a Hummer) or breaking down.  If in your reckless driving (keyboard keys aren't the most precise steering implements) you hit a police cruiser or a biker, you'll be pursued by a corresponding posse. There isn't any challenge in evading them -- simply don't hit anything and you'll escape them. However, watching bikers flail around on the rig's roof or cops dash underneath your truck is mildly amusing.    When not on the road, your time will be spent in Hick State County's fine cities. You will become all too familiar with Capital City, Skeeter's Creek, Greenback, Smokestack Heights, and Salt Sea City. While it's fun to just kick back with a couple beers at the bar, you have business to do. At each city you'll be able to pick up tips on the current hot commodity, and refuel, repair, and upgrade your truck. Once you've done these things, it's off to your next destination.   So goes the game: you pick up cargo, drive to your destination, and sell cargo, then repeat. Occasionally, this model will be broken by other drivers waging a sum of money that they can beat you in a race to a destination of your choice, or someone will hire you for a special job that involves smashing up cars, collecting debts, destroying billboards, or running over news stands. While this, coupled with your desire to upgrade your truck, keeps things interesting for a while (aka 15 - 20 minutes), soon you'll realize that this is the entire game. Special missions are few and far between, so it's a lot of trekking over all too familiar routes.     By the time you make it to day 20, you'll be thoroughly sick of the monotonous gameplay in Trial by Truck'n. Getting to day 60 is more a trial of your patience than a test of your truck'n skills. If you decide that mission mode is what you need as a brief intermission between truck stops, you'll be sad to discover that mission mode is simply a compilation of the special missions from Trial by Truck'n.   It's unfortunate that the novelty of driving an 18 wheeler wears off so quickly because BMT is full of comic style. While some might find the southern stereotyping offensive, everything is over the top and shouldn't be taken seriously. While just watching the behavior of the Jacksons is humorous enough between Big Earl's slow plodding trot and his climb into his cab that looks like he'll pull over the entire rig from his weight to Cletus' drunken gait. You'll even hear amusing radio talk show or see a news ticker scrolling the bottom of your screen with such phrase as ~You'd expect these to be more useful wouldn't you?~ ~Evil trucker spotted / plot advancement soon,~ or ~Cletus abducted by aliens...no one is surprised.~   Graphics  Big Mutha Truckers looks very much like an arcade game. You aren't going to see realistic shadowing or reflections. No licensed trucks grace this game. You aren't going to find animated drivers, particle effects, or glare from the sun.   While the console graphics are tolerable, the PC version is just fugly. Very basic character models with detailed faces. Aliasing is more than apparent.  Fairly barren backgrounds are marked by a short draw distance. Visually, it looks like this game was just slapped together and shipped out the door.    Sound  There is so much to listen to in Big Mutha Truckers. You've got the crunching of fenders, the crush of cars, screeching tires, and a badass horn. On top of all the typical sounds associated with games that have moving motorized vehicles. You have a wide selection of radio stations to choose from.   Music comes in five varieties, rock, techno-ish, new age, country, and talk show. It might not always suit your tastes, but you at least have choices. The best choice is to stick the channel on Yak so that you can hear all sorts of stereotypical southern fun making.Big Mutha Truckers is fun for a while, but the monotonous gameplay will soon catch up with you. There are only so many times you can bring yourself to traverse the highway from Capital City to Greenback. Although the novelty of driving a big rig soon stretches thin, the overall humor (until it gets recycled) of the game eases you through your sixty day excursion. A little more variety in gameplay and the ability to choose different routes to cities would really have helped the longevity of this title. While it's hard to resist the short lived entertainment that the southern stereotyping brings, it's best to let this budget title be.", "date": "Oct 21, 2003"}
