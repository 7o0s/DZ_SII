If NASCAR is the 40-ouncer of ice malt liquor in motorsports, Formula 1 is the exquisitely refined and aged French wine. It is a sport dominated by Europeans, and has become one of the most popular and well-known racing circuits on earth. Racing on courses like Monaco, Monte Carlo and Magny-Cours, France, it is a race to the finish in some of the most elegant corners of world. Translating this fast-paced and graceful sport to gaming is a job usually taken on by companies with a deep history in creating great racing simulations, but the untried Electonic Arts has decided to give it a shot. So, has EA been able to capture the spirit of Formula 1 racing in 2000?   First and foremost, the racing in F1 2000 is fast and furious. The cars give a great sense of the 200+ mph speeds, and it's really a blast. The game can be modified to suit any level of racing expertise, with features such as assisted steering and breaking for novices. For more radical racing fanatics, the cars can be tweaked in the garage for anything from camber adjustment to spring rate balancing. Each of these car modifications are clearly recognizable on the car's handling once on the track, and can give you the needed edge against Schumacher and his bloody Ferrari.   From the main menu, you can choose to jump in a car and race around for kicks on Test Day. If you want some instant action with some opponents, you can always pick a track and head straight into a Quick Race. In the Grand Prix mode, you drive through the practice, qualifying, and warm-up sessions before racing through the actual event. For those looking for a more involved experience, the best option is Championship, which takes you and your racing team through all 17 weeks of the Formula 1 circuit. The Championship mode is great to get to know a team and a car, and as most racing campaign modes go, gives you a good incentive to keep winning races  the grand daddy, the 2000 FIA Formula One World Drivers and Constructors Championship. Expect wicked competition.  The smart, ruthless, and bloodthirsty AI keeps you on your toes. AI drivers really go for the jugular, and at the start of each race it's a common to have a crash of 15+ cars caused from a little bumpin' and grindin' from the opposition. While the aggressiveness does get a little ridiculous after a while, it is a welcome option, as it keeps the F1 racing like it should be  dangerous, fast, and very competitive. After all, the excitement is in the crashes.   To be brutally honest, both the graphics and performance were very disappointing. The bottom line is that on a PII450 with 128MB of RAM (the machine suggested by EA), this game chops like a Ginsu. The framerate drops so off so badly in spots that it's nearly unplayable. This is at 640 x 480, with most of the game's graphical options turned down or completely off.  And when the graphics options are turned off, as you can guess, the game looks ugly and dated. Need for Speed 4: High Stakes, while it admittedly features completely different themed cars, ran significantly smoother and looked strikingly better than F1 2000  and this is a game that's pushing a year old. In graphical modes that most users will be forced to settle with, F1 2000's colors are dull, the terrain is blocky, and the sky is lackluster. Even the car modeling, which is easily the best visual aspect of the game, looks great in the car selection menu but degrades significantly once you hit the course. To put it simply, F1 2000 won't look great unless you have a supreme gaming rig (we're talking at least a 600+ Mhz system with a decent video card), but if you've got the animal machine it takes, it's breathtaking.   Even to those who don't follow Formula 1, the names of behind the races are infamous: Mclaren, Benetton, Williams, the newly started Jaguar, and, of course, Ferrari. Each of these teams, including all of the more obscure teams like Arrows, Minardi, and Prost are all here to choose from. The legendary superstar names behind the wheel are also in F1 2000, such as Mika Hakkinen, Eddie Irvine, and arguably the greatest racer of all time, Michael Schumacher. And yes, they race in the game just as well as their real counterparts  if you aren't practiced, they'll be lapping you before you've even got into your groove. Licensing the real names was a smooth move on EA's part, as F1 2000 wouldn't be half as fun if there weren't real teams and racers. This works out to be a real plus.   User options in F1 2000 are both extensive and useful. The graphical quality can be tweaked nearly infinitely  prepare to spend time tweaking if you don't have a monster computer  and can help in alleviating some of the performance issues. The manual, while visually nothing to get too excited about, extensively explains every aspect of F1 2000. The advantages and disadvantages of each car customization is chronicled in the book, which actually makes tooling around with the gear ratios approachable by schmoes like myself with little or no car or engine experience. The book also gives short tutorials on how to properly execute a number of turns, details each track on the circuit, and even gives a bio and race history for each team and driver. It's a thick manual, and will no doubt be appreciated by those who purchase F1 2000. The game was rock solid stable  I didn't experience a single bug or crash through all the hours I spent on the track.   The music in F1 2000 absolutely rocks. It was so great I even messed around with the disc trying to figure out a way to take the tracks so I could listen without having to boot up the game. It's obvious they spent some extra money getting talented professionals to do the music work, and it clearly paid off. The sound effects, though, were OK. Nothing special. They accurately model the sounds of Formula 1 racing, but they certainly aren't good enough to improve immersion into the racing. This is unfortunate, as engine and breaking sounds, when done right, can be a great contributing factor the enjoyment during racing.   The only way to compete online against other drivers is by exchanging IP addresses and joining directly  there isn't a player matchmaker service of any kind. It gets a little frustrating trying to find others to play with, but a matchmaker service could always be introduced by EA later on. The multiplayer racing, when you can get a partner, is exciting and well done.   So here's what F1 2000 boils down to  it's a surprisingly good racing game if you've got the machine to play it. It's also impressive that EA, a company relatively inexperienced with F1 racing, managed to make such a solid game. There are plenty of great tracks, the race replay feature is fun, and with all the teams there to choose from, you should find plenty of replay value. If you want a first rate F1 racing game with all of the legendary teams, racing names, and car customizing that you should demand, then do yourself a favor a pick up F1 2000.   -- Erik Peterson", "date": "May 10, 2000"}
