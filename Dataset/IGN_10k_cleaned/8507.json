There are two ways of doing it. You can lock yourself away for a fortnight in a damp hole with a tricked up PC, a crate of bread and a bucket to pee in/drink from, and then grind your way non-stop until you hit the higher levels. But you'll miss most of the good stuff if you choose to do it this way, and there's a good chance you'll end up certifiably insane. Instead, we've chosen what we think is a more sensible, less life-destroying method to review Lord of the Rings Online (LOTRO). Think of it as a week one review, where we talk about the experiences we've had in the first week since the game went retail in Australia. If you're looking for a review focusing on high level raid content, or how level 50 compares to the lowly entry levels, feel free to check one of the myriad of other reviews out there.   I'm not what you'd call an absolute MMO fanatic. I've played a flute in Asheron's Call 2, ridden speeder-bikes in Star Wars Galaxies, mined ore in Eve Online and even  levelled up to the mid-30s with my Night Elf Hunter in World of Warcraft. But I'm not the kind of player who pumps six hours every night of the week into a second virtual life - I like a wide variety of games, an hour here, an hour there. My LOTRO Man Hunter character (worst class/race combination name ever!) is a mere level 17, even though I've clocked close to thirty hours in the game. So if you're taking time off from levelling up your third level 70 Paladin to read this review, let me reiterate, this might not be the story for you.    However, if you've ever thought that immersing yourself in Tolkien's universe might be a relaxing distraction from the nine to five grind of real life, then dive right in. The water of Middle Earth is fine not to mention oh-so-shiny.    Check out our US video review of the game.   Please forgive me, but as somebody who read the books after falling in love with the films, I have to say that I was a little bored by them. It seemed like eighty percent of the content waffled on about the geography of the land, and who belonged where with whom. It made for a rather tedious read, especially after the films, but it's a perfect design document for fleshing out a fully realised, highly-believable world.    The team at Turbine has obviously read and re-read all the books until they were a pulpy mess. The books, that is. From the first moment you enter the beginner's instances at the start of the game, you'll feel like you're visiting a very special place in Tolkien's imagination. Walking through Hobbiton for the very first time, spying a hobbit hole nestled in the side of a hill with its cute round door, you can't help but grin. Entering the bustling environment of the Prancing Pony, complete with drinkers and bards, only to find Strider skulking away in a back room, is another moment where you'll be transported away from your dreary existence and into the quest to destroy the One Ring. The game is absolutely chock full of these moments - many of them you'll instantly recognise, while only the most ardent Tolkien fan will appreciate others.     It's something that other MMOs have lacked - an instant sense of familiarity. Most of us have seen, and loved, the LOTR movies, so we've already got a preconception of what to expect. LOTRO totally nails those expectations. It's just one reason that LOTRO is arguably the most accessible MMO I've played.   Looks like somebody's been smoking a little too much pipe-weed.  The fact that the world is absolutely breathtaking doesn't hurt its instant appeal either. Wonderful vistas stretch for miles, with forests, mountains and lakes stretching out as far as the eye can see. Players with high end PCs will obviously get the most out of the game's visuals, but even those with ancient, cobweb-encrusted machines from December, 2006 will be pleasantly surprised at how well the engine scales.    NPCs and other players seem to be visible from a greater range than other MMOs, and the special effects add immensely to the mood of certain areas. Running from the blazing hot sun outside of Bree and into the eerie, foggy interior of the Barrow Downs will have the hairs on the back of your neck standing on end. If you've read the book, you'd know that Middle Earth makes the Amazon look like an open plain, so the stunning tree technology is appreciated. Did I really just say ~stunning tree technology~? Yes I did - but it's true. Have I mentioned yet that this game also takes the dripping crown of ~Best Water Ever~? Roll all of the engines features into one and you have a game that would be remarkable if it was single player; the fact that they can make such a gorgeous MMO is mind-boggling.     What good are happy eyes if your ears can't join the party? Lucky then that LOTRO's  sound effects match the immersive visuals. Whether it's the subtle chirping of cicadas during the night, or the howling of a wounded wolf in battle, the realistic style of the sound effects lends everything an air of believability. You'll be hard pressed to hear them though - once you've heard the rousing background music you'll head straight into the menu to turn it up. There's a great variety of songs that change as you travel through the regions, be it the happy, folksy tunes in the Prancing Pony to the menacing drums in Midgewater Marsh.    With such a beautiful world, we'd be happy to simply run around all day, rolling in the leaves of the forest, but that ring isn't going to destroy itself. To help Frodo and his furry friends on their way, you'll need to quest.    The villages are so cute you can't help but want to raze them.  One of the most likable things about the game's quest system is that player growth, in the early stages at least, is really all about questing, not grinding. For those unfamiliar with the term grinding (hey, I'm pitching this review at the non-WoW players out there too!), it refers to the act of endlessly killing creatures to slowly gain experience points. Try doing this in LOTRO and your progress through the levels will be a slow and painful process. Instead, to reap maximum experience points you're much better off focusing on story-based quests. There's a nice variety of these, from escorting fragile NPCs, to finding far off ruins, to slaying dungeons full of scoundrels. And they all fit nicely with the character races. Choose a hobbit, and you'll find many of your entry-level quests revolve around helping other hobbits find ingredients for food, or tracking down mischievous children. On the other hand, pick a (self-important) Elf and you'll be tasked with more serious events, such as saving friends and retrieving ancient artefacts.    The writing behind the quests is top notch, a nice accomplishment considering the high quality of the books that the game is based upon. WoW players might be disappointed that Turbine has played it quite straight though - we've yet to encounter any pop culture references to STDs or freaky musicians. Either they don't exist, or they were too subtle for us to notice.   At launch the game has over 1500 different quests, and the colour coding system makes it easy to recognise which ones will reap you experience points and those that will see you fleeing from battle like a scared little Gollum. The instructions are for the most part very detailed, although a few times we've gotten lost when we were told to go North from a certain point, when in fact the quest should have said North West. Overall though, we've found that we didn't need to refer to third party websites to get quest guides very often.     Special Epic Quests are designed to further the story, and it's during these that you'll stumble upon the likes of Gandalf and Strider. It's during these quests that you most feel like you're inhabiting the furry feet of a Hobbit or pointy ears of an Elf, but even the side quests have a way of tying back to the overall mythology of LOTR.    Forming Fellowships with other players couldn't be easier due to the Fellowship finding tools.   If you do feel the urge to grind, fear not, as LOTRO has a Deeds system for you to waste away those gaming hours. Deed quests tend to fall into one of two categories - exploration and extinction. Exploration deeds require you to find seven or eight items in a region, but they're all tucked away, requiring thorough investigation. Extinction quests are your regular run of the mill ~Kill 100 rabid boar~ jobbies. You don't need to do these Deed quests if you don't feel like it, but if you do you'll be rewarded with a trait, which is basically a permanent buff, as well as a title that will appear after your name. I'm currently known as Gunomir the Shell-Breaker, thanks to my penchant for slaughtering helpless Neeker-breekers.     A good interface can make or break an MMO - just look at The Matrix Online for an example of how not to do it. Turbine figured out that WoW has an ideal interface, and then wholeheartedly, unashamedly, copied it. And why not? It works perfectly. Hell, they've even improved it where it needed to be improved. For a new player, my biggest relief was seeing that I started the game with not one, but FIVE bags, allowing me to carry plenty of crap around. Forming a fellowship with other players enables voice communications, making coordination in the heat of battle simple. They're small improvements over WoW, but the little polishes here and there make all the difference.     If you're the kind of player who lives only to slaughter players twenty levels below you, and then camp over their corpse, we've got news for you. First off, you're a bit of an a-hole. Secondly, you might not like the PvP system in LOTRO. There isn't one as such. That is, you can't join a PvP server and fight anybody around you - you're all on the same side in LOTRO, so that wouldn't make sense.   However, to itch that player-killing scratch, LOTRO implements a unique feature called Monster Play. Once you hit level 10, a special port opens up, allowing you to take control of one of Sauron's evil minions. A level 50 evil minion, no less, although a level 50 Monster isn't as powerful as a level 50 player. You can then fight other players using their main characters - if they're brave enough to enter the designated PvP area called the Ettenmoors. Unfortunately, right now there aren't a lot of good guys of a high enough level for us to see what the Monster Play is really like. You'll have to wait for our second review in three months for a more detailed analysis.    At times you'll simply head for the highest hill, surveying the vast landscapes around you.  LOTRO wouldn't be an MMO if it didn't launch without a Troll-load of issues. So LOTRO must not be an MMO then. We can't think of a single MMO launch that has been so problem-free. Seriously, the servers are stable, there have only been a handful of broken quests, and the stuttering we experienced at launch appears to have been an issue with X-fire. It's been a remarkably smooth launch experience (Vista crashes notwithstanding but that's Vista for you).    And now on to the problems of the game. Hmmm, funny thing is, at this early stage in the game, it's really hard to find any. The biggest issue some have is that it's not reinventing WoW's wheel. Bugger 'em, I say. LOTRO has taken all that's good about WoW, given it years of polish and lathered it all up in a back-story that I actually give a damn about. The review isn't over yet though - we'll be revisiting the review in three months to see if the quest to destroy the ring has the depth and breadth that MMO players demand.", "date": "May 22, 2007"}
