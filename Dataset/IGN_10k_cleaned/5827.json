Without competition to keep you innovative, you tend to rest on the proverbial laurels. The ceasing of WCW and ECW have definitely had this effect on the WWE -- and it's certainly reflected in the new WWE Aftershock for the N-Gage. The only aftershock felt here will be the sorry realization that after breaking the shrinkwrap, the game cannot be returned.   WWE Aftershock didn't have to be a mediocre wrestling game. For one thing, developer Exient is actually quite talented. There are several cool match options, like ladder matches (King of the Ring) and tag team. The game includes Bluetooth play for online multiplayer against a nearby foe. (The multiplayer is strictly one-on-one, though.) But save for these few facts, the majority of WWE Aftershock is a big disappointment.   It's hard not to immediate rag on the visuals. The N-Gage can produce much better graphics than these awful character models and bland rings. The wrestling look like they are composed of glued-together cardboard boxes, splashed with poor paintjobs. The models are recognizable only by outfits and relative size since the texture work is muddy and haphazard. The superstars lumber about the ring with absolutely no grace nor athletic prowess -- they shamble like the undead, occasionally zapped by an off-stage cattle prod.   The controls are also sluggish. The moves don't happen fast themselves, so perhaps this qualifies as a ~feature.~ It's more of an annoyance. You can dish out a few select kicks and punches, as well as perform Irish whips and grapples. But it feels like the men in tights are swimming through molasses to get to their opponent. As you pound your opponent, he starts losing stamina, making it easier to pin him. You can try more advanced moves, like a leap from the turnbuckle, to really steal some health -- but why bother when you can pretty much just destroy any comer with repeated chops?   Also discouraging is that the different wrestlers pretty much control the same. Speed is different, depending on the size of the wrestler, but for the most part, if you master one superstar, you can play with any of them.   WWE Aftershock includes 12 superstars, such as Big Show, Rey Mysterio, and John Cena. The line-up is small, but it includes fan favorites. Unfortunately, these are the only wrestlers you ever get to play with. The game is missing a create-a-player mode, something that is common place for wrestling games now. In the face of the game's litany of shortcomings, this loss is heavily felt.   The game does possess some decent audio, though. Each wrestler has entrance music that fits their ~character.~ The punches and kicks happen with no on-screen authority, but they sound like solid hits every time. It's actually kinda jarring.  WWE Aftershock is a missed opportunity. These are the kind of games that make people turn their noses up at the N-Gage, and the presence of two powerful new handhelds on the market certainly isn't helping things, either. The absolutely unattractive graphics are really off-putting, because I know (as well as any N-Gage fan) the machine can do much better. If you are a wrestling fan, I still advise you to steer clear. Maybe look into King of Fighters instead. It's not the same kind of fighting, but it's at least fun and decent to look at.", "date": "Jun 16, 2005"}
