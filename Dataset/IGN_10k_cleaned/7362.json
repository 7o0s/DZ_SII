Players hadn't experienced anything quite like it before and the wall of football stats and facts wasn't exactly easy to digest. But over time confusion turned to interest and in turn obsession, with thousands of gamers ditching their social life in an attempt to take their team to the top of the league. It immersed the player in another world, one where they really could be the next Alex Ferguson.   Championship Manager 2 collected the ball in midfield and went on a surging run to firmly establish the game in the mainstream. Everything was bigger and better, plus it crammed a brain-melting wealth of stats and innumerable new features that turned something already dangerously addictive into a life-consuming passion. When you weren't playing it, you were thinking about it, mulling over tactics in bed and weighing up transfer opportunities on the bus.    A few years and one name change later, Football Manager 2007 arrived, bloated with new features over FM2006 - some of which have a more profound effect on the game than others, but all build on the game's believable - and sometimes unpredictable - universe. Take team talks for example: they've been ramped up slightly so you can now dish them out before the game as well as at half time and full time. More useful still is the feedback provided for individual player's reactions, meaning you can determine how to approach pep talks in the future depending on whether they motivated, upset or perhaps not even paying attention at all!   The transfer aspect of the game benefits from a brush up too, with the option to ask new signings to recommend former club or international team mates a particularly nice idea. And just like real life you must exercise caution, because while they might be your greatest signing yet, the recommendation might just be a favour for a mate who's trying to ditch his old team.   Elsewhere, the new feeder club feature enables large clubs to team up with smaller sides and develop players. So, if you're managing a heavyweight club like Chelsea, you get first refusal on players coming through, while the club has the opportunity to take youth and reserve players on loan from their sugar daddy side. The disadvantage is you won't be able to hang onto any really good players you bring through yourself. There's much more involvement now at board level too, with takeovers occurring, embargos being placed on transfer activity and new boards wanting to bring in their own management, putting more pressure on you to deliver results.   There's even the option to give your manager (you, in other words) a player background, determining whether you were a lower league journeyman or an international star in your glory days. This effects how players react to you, particularly early in the game before you've built your rep as a manager. And the bigger a name you are the more respect you get, but with it comes greater expectation.   These new features aside, the game plays out in much the same way as previous Football Manager titles. The options are deep and exhaustive and, due to the sheer quantity of information available, the interface takes some getting used to. A little practice is all that's required though, and practice you will. It's scary how hours can disappear just skipping around screens, searching for players and tinkering with tactics without even advancing the game.   To describe just what Football Manager does better than its competitors is simply to describe Football Manager. From a purely aesthetic point of view it manages to present a phenomenal wealth of information clearly and attractively. Sure, with so much depth it's daunting for new players at first, but you can play it as superficially or comprehensively as you like. You can use preset formations and leave your staff to deal with teamtalks, contract renewals and all the other nitty-gritty, but as you grow more confident you can gradually take control of more elements of the club and you'll soon want to be running things from the bottom up.Football Manager 2007s greatest achievement - and the most compelling reason to buy it - is the incomparably immersive world it creates. You find yourself oohing at big money transfers between other clubs, you feel good when one of your players praises you up and you develop personal rivalries with other managers and clubs, making you actively and emotionally involved in the whole experience. There are very few games that can generate that level of involvement and its for this reason Football Manager 2007 cannot be beat. Just be prepared for a serious lack of social life after its installed on your hard drive.", "date": "Oct 13, 2006"}
