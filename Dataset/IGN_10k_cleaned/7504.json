These ultra-popular gaming rigs are full of casual time-killers designed to go well with beers and friends. Now, the bar staple has a very unlikely partner. Up to this point, Square Enix Mobile has concentrated primarily on bringing out cell versions of their popular brands, such as Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy. But the American mobile scene definitely leans toward the casual market, and that's something Brave Fencer Musashi is most definitely not. So now Cloud and friends share shelf space with bar games.   Megatouch 3-in-1 is a collection of casual mini-games -- two of which you've likely played in some form or another. Bejeweled fans will likely recognize Q-Shot, a match-'em-up puzzler that trades out gems for pool balls. You move through screen after screen of colorful, numbered balls, rotating pairs to match up three or more. Earn enough points and you move on to the next round. 11Up is a card game where you must create hands that equal eleven, no matter what combo. You have a deck to draw from when the on-screen cards do make the math work.   Box Drop, however, was new to me. You have a series of columns, all marked with a specific number. Your goal is to stack numbered boxes in the columns so they equal the designated amount. You can create a recycle column of boxes when you see a number you think will be useful later, but doesn't help out matters at the moment. Box Drop is the toughest of the three games in Megatouch, and it's definitely the one I liked the most.   The problem with Megatouch, though, is that two-thirds of the game has been done elsewhere -- and one-half of that two-thirds (I love fractions) is modeled after the ubiquitous Bejeweled. In Megatouch's favor? Solid presentation and Box Drop. The game screens are clean and colorful, the interface is easy to use, the music is actually pretty good.  Megatouch is by no means a bad game -- it's just that the majority of it is familiar territory. For gamers that already have Bejeweled (or Zoo Keeper, Jewel Quest, or Diamond Quest) and/or a card that that includes a 11Up-ish challenge (most games use 21), Megatouch might not present the best value. However, if you're new to mobile and looking for a decent collection of venerable staples -- and the entertaining Box Drop -- Megatouch might be a good place to start.", "date": "Nov 3, 2006"}
