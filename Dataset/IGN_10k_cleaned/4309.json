The Sacred Cards marks the fourth Yu-Gi-Oh! title released on the Game Boy Advance. We've been quite open to the whole Yu-Gi-Oh! card game thing because its game design is deceptively deep and complex, offering far more strategy than it initially lets on. But while Yu-Gi-Oh! The Sacred Cards tries to involve more RPG elements into a videogame version of the trading card game, it also removes a whole lot of strategic elements and makes this new videogame version far too easy...regardless of your Yu-Gi-Oh playing level. Features More than a thousand cards Win new cards in a battle Includes three limited edition cards Cartridge save (one slot)  When the first two Yu-Gi-Oh games were released on the Game Boy Advance, we admired the style of gameplay, but were somewhat disappointed with how the matches against the computer opponent were portrayed. They both lacked a certain amount of personality because the games were laid out in a bland menu fashion instead of having the player more realistically seek out card battles in a given area. Pokemon: Trading Card Game did this. SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash did this. And finally, Yu-Gi-Oh: The Sacred Cards does this. Sort of.  Players wander around Battle City during a time where the Kaiba Corporation is sponsoring a Yu-Gi-Oh tournament. The game reeks of a Pokemon gym battle as players must challenge other Yu-Gi-Oh duelists, some of which hold Locator Cards. By defeating the specific player with a Locator Card, you win his card and trigger events that open up the ability to challenge the next person with a Locator Card. There's really no penalty for losing these battles; though you're technically playing for Locator Cards, you never actually lose ones you've earned if the computer opponent defeats you...your character simply ends up back at home at the save game spot.  The battles are handled through the familiar Yu-Gi-Oh! card game where players take turn discarding creatures that can attack each other, and eventually the Duelist if he or she doesn't have creatures to defend him or herself. Traps and spells enhance the creatures and players during their turn...the Duelist who runs out of personal hit points is the loser...so it's important to have a plan of attack with a set of cards that will do this job. The game features more than a thousand cards of different abilities, so there is a bit of strategy in creating a strong deck. Though the game tries to be an RPG, it really isn't. It offers the familiar overhead exploration perspective, but most Duelist battles must be initiated by the player with a tap of the R button...occasionally players will have to enter a battle simply by talking with an opponent, but these are rare. The other elements of a Japanese RPG are here in small form; each victory raises the level of the player that will give him or her the ability to wield and utilize more powerful cards.  The problem is, by streamlining the pace of the game, this RPG actually removes a bit of strategy from the overall Yu-Gi-Oh game design by adding a new element that creates much stronger creatures against different types. This was done to speed things up, obviously, but the result is a Yu-Gi-Oh game that's incredibly easy to win. After several dozen battles it's pretty common to blow out the opposition 90 percent of the time. And since there's no real penalty for losing a Duelist battle players can simply learn from the mistakes and fix their decks appropriately. But these are so rare that you can literally win the game without much adjusting to your deck.  And the most disappointing part: no matter how much work you actually put into your deck's strength, you can never pit it up against anyone but computer-controlled opponents in the RPG. This is the first Yu-Gi-Oh title released on the GBA without any sort of link cable function, so much of the busy work is completely lost...there's barely any incentive to put thought into a strong deck since the computer opponents are so easy to defeat. Yu-Gi-Oh: The Sacred Cards is a drastic step backwards from what the past two Yu-Gi-Oh games established on the Game Boy Advance. The card game is much more fast-paced, and makes things move a lot more streamlined, but it's pretty easy to see that the rules have changed a little bit to make this happen. The Yu-Gi-Oh! developers need to find a happy medium between this RPG and the past card games...when that happens, we'll finally get a card game as deep and engrossing as Pokemon: TGC on the Game Boy Color, and SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash released for the NeoGeo Pocket Color...two games that did it better several years before.", "date": "Dec 8, 2003"}
