For many a year have we two been parted, but now we are finally reunited.  Nostalgic gamers need no introduction here, for Shadowgate is notorious among those of us who have been amusing ourselves with video games for well over a decade.  This is what spawned other names like Deja Vu and The Uninvited, but there is no contest here;  Shadowgate wipes the floor with every single one of them.  The graphics are poor and inanimate, commands are limited, and players will often find themselves scratching their heads in confusion.  So why do I enjoy this game?  Innovative gameplay, folks, and that's all that matters.  It's hard to find a game that will keep you coming back over and over again despite how taxing the puzzles may be.  Features: Three battery-backed save slots Dozens of puzzles For Game Boy Color only   The second you pick up Shadowgate Classic, you are going to be hooked, mark my words.  You will spend hours searching every twist, every bend of the enormous castle all for the satisfaction of defeating the warlock who threatens to summon the ~behemoth~.  Oh no, don't even think about putting it down for a second;  this game now owns you.  That's right, turn the game back on and get to work, because you've got a long way to go!  As your game begins, you are left standing all alone in front of the door to the castle Shadowgate with nothing at all.  That quickly changes the second you enter, because you can take and use almost everything you see.  Maps, books, stones, skulls, everything,  no matter how insignificant it seems, may be stored in your large inventory for future use.  Don't overlook even the smallest thing, because it has a guaranteed purpose.  Unless you're brand new to video games, Shadowgate Classic is much different than everything else on the market.  Instead of the common paradigm where mashing buttons beats a game, this one requires thought.  You cannot jump, you cannot run.  Instead, you can do only these:  Move, Look, Take, Open, Leave, Self, Use, Hit, Close, and Speak.  Trying those, especially in combinations, can help you move from puzzle to puzzle.  But trust me, you will be confused early in the game, there is no way around it.  Play around with your commands and more often than not, you'll be surprised to see what happens.  The basic idea of Shadowgate's puzzles is that you have locate the correct items in order to bypass every single situation.  Sometimes the only way to get further is to find a key, while others demand a weapon to defeat a creature.  The first puzzle is simple:  You are outside of the castle and decide to enter.  Straight ahead and to your right are locked doors.  How do you open one of them?  With a key, of course!  Notice the skull above the castle's entrance?  That looks peculiar enough!  This is where your own wits come into play.  In order to find what the skull is hiding, you have to ~open~ it.  Once  you do, you will be rewarded with the first key!  Take it and it will appear in your inventory.  This, fellow readers, is one example of the many puzzles you will confront, and they only get harder from here!  Look carefully at your surroundings and try everything.  Sometimes the least likely possibility is the one that works best!  Luckily, you have plenty of time to decide which choice would work best during each circumstance, but how much you have is limited.  Torches work as ~time~ in this game, and it's important that you have plenty in reserve.  If your torches run out of light, it's game over, and you'll have to continue from where you last saved.  Keep your eyes open for torches on the walls, because they can be found all over the castle, and are absolutely necessary to survive.  Another necessity is saving. Do it often. Traps and deadly situations are everywhere, and saving your game frequently will prevent you from having to redo the little annoyances that are all over.  Shadowgate is designed to piss off its players, and it does a fantastic job with its puzzles quite like nothing else.  This type of game, folks, is a perfect example of what works great on Game Boy Color.  One thing that gamers may find aggravating about Shadowgate Classic is that once it is conquered, it is possible to slide from the beginning to the end of the entire journey in minutes.  Should that matter, really?  The game itself will take hours of playing before it is unraveled, assuming you don't cheat by getting help from an outside source, and is one of the most difficult games I have had of the pleasure of overcoming.  Nevertheless, once you beat it, it's time to move on.  That said, it is also quite bland.  Shadowgate Classic lacks luster in its graphical appearance, and if you are able to see any kind of animation whatsoever, consider it a treat!  Still image after still image would go by better if things on the screen had more action.  Although each room is detailed with creatures and objects galore, there is a dire need of movement.  Naturally, Kemco wanted to keep the classic adventure in its former glory, and that's all good, but bringing back an oldy ~as is~ comes with a price if you look at it in comparison to what the Game Boy Color can do now.   Nonetheless, it's the gameplay itself that makes the game, right?  Durn skippy.   I remember this from over a decade ago, and memories returned to me as I ventured deeper into the stronghold's bowels.  I hate this game because it's so damn hard, but I love it for the very same reason.  It's this very same classic that was great on the NES and old computers, but it's even better now that it can be taken on the go!  Shadowgate Classic is ideal for portable gaming, and couldn't have come to a better place than Game Boy.", "date": "Feb 2, 2000"}
