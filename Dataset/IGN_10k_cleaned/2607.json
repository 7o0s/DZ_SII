Romanticized in novels and television, the pirates life has become a wishful fantasy for many.  In truth, pirates were more often victims of disease (Scurvy bad! Syphilis bad!) than gun shots, plank walkings, or sword guttings.  But who wants reality?  It's all about those swashbuckling fantasies.  There aren't too many pirate games out there, and even fewer good ones.  When Lucas Arts' Monkey Island series, a hilarious pirate spoof, is the best thing out there, that's saying something.  In comes EA, hoping to capitalize on some of the cool themes found in so many pirate flicks.  But, instead of commanding a proud pirate ship, it's pure mutiny above deck.  Yes, Pirates: The Legend of Black Kat walks the plank and dives into a sea of mediocrity.   Features  Pirates aplenty! Arrrrrr!  Travel the globe seeking revenge  Fight on land and at sea  Upgradeable weapons and ships  Eye patch not included     Gameplay  As adventuring pirate Katerina De Leon, brave enemies on both land and sea to avenge your family and restore honor to your name.  Unfortunately, Pirates isn't nearly as fun as all that sounds.  The game has two aspects, one on land and the other at sea.  On land, you run around as the busty Katerina De Leon and at sea you fearlessly command your own pirate ship.  Yarrr.  The game is pretty simple, too simple for its own good.     For those looking for a really cool, serious pirate game, turn away.  This is not for you.  Pirates must be seen for what it is, a standard adventure game dressed in pirate costumes, squawking parrots, and deadly cannonballs.  Instead of puzzles, Pirates sends players on a series of hunting quests.  Find an item, return to a specific area, go to next area, kill guy, open new door, find another item, return to the chest, retrieve magic conch shell, continue with quest.     The world of Pirates is littered with power-ups and collectible items.   This is nothing new to adventure fans and Pirates does a fine job with the same-old thing.  There's a good tutorial to help you get started on your way, teach you how to control Katerina, use the world around her, and captain your ship.  There really isn't too much to learn though, because the game is pretty basic.  When you get into a scuffle (and scuffle you will) Katerina has the option to block, jump, or attack.  The attack is the same thing, over and over and over.  The same combo animation.  Again and again.  For a game with more then ten hours of gameplay and plenty of combat, this is just too bland to suffice.  Like so much of Pirates, the game passes standards but doesn't excel beyond average.      The whole adventure takes place in a slew of coves, seaports, and on dozens of islands. These are broken up into the kinds of locations we all have become familiar with over the years: There are the Pirate Isles, the Haunted Isles, The Voodoo Isles, the Winter Isles, the Volcanic Isles, and lastly, Skull Cove. Each set contains its own group of like enemies and its own bosses. You fight massive crab bosses, Black Beard the Pirate, Voodoo bosses and Skeleton bosses.  One of the cool things in the game is some of the boss battles.  As most of the characters have really cheesy dialogue and won't make much of an impression, the bosses stand out.  Fighting a giant skeleton is always a positive.  Of course, you'll be doing it with the standard A-bashing attack system.   It should be noted that you can also purchase ranged weapons, like throwing knives, which help add a bit more variety to some rather bland combat.   The best aspect of Pirates is the ship combat.  Hopping into your ship, Wind Dancer, you'll set sail on the high seas (which look rather appealing) to do battle with numerous enemies.  Battles are fast and again are more arcade than sim.  But here, that arcade feel is more welcome.  Basically, ship battles are a good ol' shoot-'em-up between Wind Dancer and whoever dares cross her path.  But, you can't board other ships!  What is a pirate game without the ability to board ships and go hand-to-hand with your enemies?  You can buy more powerful weapons for your ship, and there are lumber and sail pick-ups, which allow you to repair Wind Dancer during or after a battle.  Ship upgrades can also be purchased, which you will be thankful for.  Piloting the seas is extremely slow in your initial ship and will feel like a drag getting around.   I guess my problem with the game lies in just how average it efforts to be.  Here you have a pirate game, a chance to either play it spoofy or go for a gritty game filled with what we love most about pirate lore (hint: Parrots are not what we love most about pirate lore). Instead of going either route, Pirates goes the middle of the road, and everything feels uninspired.  It is a long game, though, offering quite a bit of adventure.  So, even though it fails to really capture the spirit of pirate lore, it at least won't end three hours after you've bought it.      Graphics  Pirates looks pretty much the same as it did on the PS2.  And now on the Xbox, it really is lacking any kind of polish or punch.  Games are looking better and better.  Some of the things we've seen out now and in the near future are jaw-dropping.  The graphics in Pirates can't pull up much higher than mediocrity, which is a shame.  There is a very noticeable level of detail perimeter (a point at which an area loses detail and becomes smoother and more generic).  Anything within a ten-foot radius of our heroine looks a lot sharper, with more textures.  But outside that radius looks almost fuzzy.  A lot of games have this, but not so close that it's constantly noticeable.     The water looks great, and the sea is quite inviting.  Best is when you are close to shore.  The water is such a clear, beautiful blue that you can see some of the land mass beneath water level.  It stands out from the rest of the game which is, well, average.   The animations are decent, but the game can get really choppy when surrounded by more than a couple of enemies.  It's not consistently bad, but from time to time the framerate will crash pretty hard.  Katerina, herself, is your standard heroine with gigantic breasts begging to pop free of the constraints of her outfit.  Does this really sell games?  I certainly hope not.  Isn't it about time developers gave up on gratuitous bouncing bobblies and focused more on solid gameplay?   Sound  Featuring 5.1 Surround Sound, Pirates Xbox certainly outdoes the PS2 in the sound department.  But not by much.  The surround isn't used particularly well, though you do get a nice kick from the subwoofer when your cannonballs rock another ship.  Certainly not a bad effort as far as utilizing 5.1 properly, but (again) nothing special.   The score is your standard adventuring fare.  It isn't too bad, but it doesn't really feel unique to the game itself.  If I started humming the tune from The Adventure of Link or one of the fine diddy's from the Final Fantasy series, you'd probably recognize it right away.  I don't think I could recognize the score from Pirates the day after I played it.  As is the theme of this review: Not bad, but nothing special.  Pirates is not a bad game, it's just not that great.  This is the definition of a middle of the road game.  It does offer a lot of gameplay, but that gameplay feels pretty standard.  Is it fun?  At times.  Is it tedious?  Occasionally.  Is it worth $50?  Probably not, though a rental would give you a pretty good idea of its value to you.  I'm still waiting for a pirate game that can equal the addictiveness and sense of adventure as Pirates Gold.  Monkey Island did a much better job at capturing the spirit of pirate lore and it's a spoof title.  Perhaps the next in the Pirates series will go a bit further.  Until then, Pirates Gold still remains king in the console pirate world.", "date": "Apr 9, 2002"}
