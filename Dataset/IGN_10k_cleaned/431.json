We're just asking for too much -- a dozen or so fully-articulated human riders, all jockeying with cunning AI, racing on crisscrossing outdoor tracks that often show the back half of the track (with riders) while you are racing in the foreground, backed by a realistic physics engine that not only  recreate bumps and slides of your bike but also simulates tread wear, hills and banking turns, and engine damage -- this is near impossible. And it all has to be fun!  So the fact that Supercross Circuit is sort of fun does help cover the fact that this game is almost nothing like supercross racing. Instead of going for great physics, 989 and Idol Minds have taken the very basics of their own Rally Cross, thrown away all the gravity, and implemented a trick system. It does have a lot of sim elements, but it's heart is in the arcade racing of the 16-bit Road Riot / Super Off-Road '80s. Gameplay Not many of us in this office liked the gameplay in Supercross Circuit, as the game has a terrible physics engine. No matter whether you are hauling up a hill, sailing off a jump, or diving out of the air head-first without your bike underneath, the game will always move at the same relative speed. You feel like you are playing a FMV game with a bike pasted on top and a velocity engine running the frame rate.  This is the arcade nature of the game. It feels much more like a sprite-based game rather than a fully-3D racer. There are bumps and drops, but you don't have to use the throttle as intelligently as you do in EA's Supercross 2000, and you don't have to wiggle and ride the whoop-dees as much as you do in something like Excitebike (yes, even an NES game had more realistic control over this game). The career mode forces you to upgrade and retrofit your bike, but the general feel never improves much. The tracks look open, but there are invisible walls all over the place, and you can't get off the track even if you wanted to (hitting an invisible wall in the air is really lame. Championship Motocross Featuring Ricky Charmichael had the same flaw; EA's Supercross 2000 doesn't).  The game also has a terrible trick system that makes this racer look basic and extremely rushed. There are a lot of moves you can pull out of your bag of tricks (including nac-nacs, bar spin, and Superman seat grab (though they've renamed this maneuver in the game itself). However, the tricks look as if they are just replacing an in-air rider sprite with a short, choppy set of frames for a given move. The challenge for all of the tricks is to get through the animation and get back to the neutral frame before you land. Moves don't throw off your center of balance at all. Worse still, the tricks have no purpose but to be showy -- they don't effect performance or draw the crowd to you, and they can't really be linked into combos.  However, extended play does reveal some of the game's better points. First off, the game has a lot of depth in the track selection. There are three types of tracks in the game (Supercross, motorcross, and standard 'local' tracks), and each type plays and looks differently. Supercross races are set in stadiums and concentrate on tight corners, banked turns, and lumpy terrain, while 'local' tracks are the more open, winding races that are closer to standard car races. Motorcross is a sort of cross between the two, with an open-air course set in a medium-sized area (something like you might see on the X-Games). With 21 licensed tracks as well as four standard racing courses, there's a lot to get through here, and that doesn't include the freestyle trick arenas or the awesome course designing feature (which doesn't give you a lot of vertical leeway, but still gives you the chance to build a wild track).  The game isn't so hot as a realistic racer, but it does incorporate some motorbike theory to the gameplay. Banked turns aren't high enough to work the way they should, but they do force you to cut a different line than you would in a car racer. The track also takes some damage, so while you'll never get to feel the difference in surfaces like you would in an on-and-off-road rally racer, you will slip if you hit a groove etched in the favorite line. The game isn't too realistic, but it does emphasize the difference between racing a street car versus a  crotch rocket . Graphics Gritty like the sport, but mostly in the right ways. Supercross Circuit has a powerful graphic engine that throws a ton up on the screen at a time without slowing down. It looks like garbage at first, with pixels you can count. However, everything manages to still be clear, as logos and names can be clearly seen on the backs of jerseys. Once you get out of the pack, the graphics really start showing their stuff, as there is no fogging or terrible pop-up to block your view of the back side of the track. Get out all alone, and you will see all the other chumps in the background fighting through the pack or hanging tricks off rad pops.  Animation, however, is ass. With so many riders on the track, this could be expected, but even given that, the game looks sad in motion. Your rider moves in choppy steps, and he doesn't adjust to the road almost at all. Tires don't look like they are moving. There are also very few effects to spice up the average-looking graphics. Mud crusts up on the bike and the rider, but the effect is done by just gluing a few brown pixels to the bike and shirt textures. Cameras flash in the arenas, but they do so in a looping animation -- they don't take more pictures when you are pulling off a trick. The level of detail doesn't get any better once you dust the mob either. No matter whether there are eight other riders on-screen or just yourself, the game is chunky. Sound Rrrrrr, rrrrrrr, rrrrr, rrr, rrrrrr... RRRRRRRR!!! Rrrrr, rrrrr, rrrrr.  Engine sounds. If you want them, come and get them. Nothing else will get out of the noise floor. All you get is a revving engine, and not a very noisy one at that (have you ever been to one of these events? They're f***'ing loud!). There is music, but treble-based rock music just blends in with the droning motor clattering.EA, THQ, Acclaim, and 989 will probably hate me for telling you this secret, but the PlayStation does not, will not, and cannot have a good motorcross game. That said, 989 may be in the best place amongst all of these titles. None of these biking games controls particularly well, nor do they handle real-world physics too honestly. That means that Supercross Circuit, with its breadth of options and courses, is the best choice for the middle-of-the-road gamer who just wants to get that feeling of having 400 horses whirring between their legs.", "date": "Nov 20, 1999"}
