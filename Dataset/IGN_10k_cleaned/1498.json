But Ubi Soft is showing that Rayman was just the beginning, cranking out impressive platformers end on end. Some haven't delivered fully on their potential (unfortunately, that includes the recently released Aladdin ), but more than making up for that game's shortcomings is this wonderful and creative version of The Jungle Book -- with vivid graphics, precise controls, intelligent levels, and an imaginative approach to gameplay, this is easily one of the very best and most enjoyable platformers on the system.    Features:  Based on the Disney animated adaptation of Kipling's classic novel Over twenty levels of adventure, plus fun bonus stages Ride Bagheera through the jungle, and dangle from Shere Kahn's tail  Learn new vine-swinging and acrobatic moves Only for Game Boy Color   Taking a page off of the Rayman engine (as did Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers  -- the teams for all three games share some talent in animators, game designers, and sound techs), The Jungle Book: Mowgli's Wild Adventure feels and looks vaguely similar to the team's other efforts. But before I even bother to point out how there's nothing wrong with this, that the previous efforts from this development team have been sterling platformers, instead the game throws us all for a loop with a very different level structure and game design. Mowgli may move and control similar to the limbless Rayman, but his quest is a very different challenge indeed.  Instead of offering a simple butt-bouncing hop-and-pop action platformer, Ubi Soft and Disney Interactive have gone more the route of the dignified Prince of Persia. Mowgli very rarely takes on an enemy head on. Rather, he finds crafty ways of outsmarting foes or escaping them entirely. When a monkey guard stands in his path, the mancub must find a banana to distract Louie's minions to distract them from their post. And when a platform stands outside of his reach, Mowgli can lure a warthog (who looks suspiciously like Pumbaa from The Lion King, although the character also exists in Walt's classic as well) out to leap on and off of to grasp that limb.  There are general action elements -- the game just wouldn't do the genre justice without an homage to Mario with the butt-bounce -- but those come few and far in between, and for the most part, the adventure pits man against nature rather than against animal. Mowgli will have to find switches for traps and learn techniques for breaking barriers to advance through the quest to manhood. When he does have to fight, the gameplay is steady and sharp -- there's even a Samus Aran-style spin attack to wipe out opposition.  But it's the moments outside of the brawls and butt attacks that set this game apart. Here, the control is near perfect, with lanky little Mowgli springing and flying through the forest, dangling from vines and slip-sliding across branches. It's also super-fast, with intuitive button assignments and precise special move control. All of this is accompanied with exemplary animation that never stands in the way of the gameplay. My only complaint might be that the gymnastic poles are a little wonky, and the very end sequence scrolls funny, but since the game puts little demand on the meticulousness, life-or-death gaming, you can always pick yourself back up and try again if you call. The game design is so bold and well though-out that there are no bottomless or spiked pits until near the very end of the game -- players always have the ability to keep going, so long as their mind can wrap itself around the challenge of that stage.  All of this is coupled with some of the most beautiful graphics yet on the Game Boy Color. Luscious forest backgrounds shine with color and detail. All of the creatures in the game animate beautifully as well (although the racing escape atop Bagheera's back looks sort of cheated), and the clear expressiveness of the characters brings the film alive. There's even a smooth opening FMV, with some classy interstitial drawings in between levels.   There is, however, a good bit of slowdown throughout in certain parts of levels. It won't destroy your chances of making it through, since the game's designers have avoided the cheap ploy of bottomless pits to knock out players, but the game chops up sometimes in very tricky leaps, and since there seems to be no rhyme or reason for the slowdown (it very rarely happens when enemies are on screen -- it's almost entirely random), it's tough to get by these challenges since there's no way of fixing the problem. These issues are few, and they only interrupt gameplay for a few second, but they can put you off your game.  Still, this problem never frustrating, and the game's challenge still stands quite fair. Most players will be able to sing through the game without ever seeing the Game Over screen, since extra lives are plentiful, and if ever you find yourself running low, just return to a previous level and snag up some life gems. (The Password, unfortunately, does not save your stock of lives, but extra chances are easily plentiful and rarely spent.) There are also multiple objectives to each stage, which let Mowgli cruise through simply once then require him to return and finish all of the stage's objectives before the major event stage at the end of each world (and again, these are not just mere boss battles -- instead, Mowgli will be leaping on Kaa's back as he slithers through treetops and following buzzards to escape the briars.) If it all proves too much to finish in one sitting (and it certainly will), there's a simple, four-digit password save. And if Mowgli does make his journey complete, he can always return to his forest home for some bonus adventures.     Ubi Soft really has a winning team behind the Rayman engine, and this latest game to tap its treasures almost advances over the previous effort. The Kaa level alone near the end of the game is one of my favorite twists on the platforming standards ever. It does have a familiar feel, but Rayman was near perfect in the controls, and the way that The Jungle Book uses that same scheme in a Prince Of Persia-style quest and still holds up sharp and fast is amazing.Outside of Nintendo's own in-house games, you'll rarely see a Perfect 10 score in a Game Boy game, and this is another one that comes just an inch short of that marathon run. The game has dozens of stages, but is still brief compared to Rayman. There's not quite as much variety in the environments (which is inherent given the license) or control techniques (again a given -- Mowgli just doesn't have the ability to spin his head into a propeller or throw his hands). In general, I would have wished to see more of Disney's characters -- Baloo makes only a few cameos, and he never gets a chance to belt out a verse of ~Bear Necessities.~  Also, the ending is abrupt and sort of a let-down for such a fine production, and though the extra stages are great new challenges, they don't save Time Attack scores like Rayman. And it really bums me out to see that Ubi Soft has abandoned their innovative Ubi Key system that unlocks stages in other Ubi games. It's doubtful that many gamers even were able to ever tap this feature, but for those who did, it was an awesome addition. I was so hoping this adventure would continue on forever with each new Ubi Soft game like Rayman promises, but it looks like that road has finally come to the end of the line.All of these are minor quibbles. The game's design itself is enough to recommend, since it's such a different type of platformer. Add to that some first-rate graphics and Disney quality animation, honest challenge, tight control, wonderful atmosphere, and simply fun gameplay, and you have one of the surprise greats on the system.", "date": "Nov 18, 2000"}
