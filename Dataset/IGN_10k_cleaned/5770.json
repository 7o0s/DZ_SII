These skill-based contests actually result in real-world prizes, such as gift certificates for popular retailers like Target and Best Buy. Naturally, the promise of winning free stuff would foster an interest in the line-up, but it's Atlas Mobile's gift for applying their prize-winning formula only to skill games where it would make absolute sense.   Boulder Dash Tournaments for Prizes is based on the classic action-puzzle game from First Star Software. The game dates all the way back to the Commodore 64 era, and the game keeps on going strong. Boulder Dash Tournaments for Prizes follows the basic premise and rules of the game, but introduces a scoring element to it that successfully turns it into a competitive game, appropriate for the For Prizes treatment.   Each game is composed of four individual caves -- but since each cave is randomly generated, no two games are ever the same. This randomness keeps the game fresh and fair. The caves are full of diamonds that must be collected to open the exit. Caves are full of obstacles, like falling boulders and fireflies. You can use boulders to crush enemies, resulting in a cascade of diamonds.   The hero also has items that can be used during play. Bombs detonate their surroundings. Hammers allow you to cut through a boulder. A cave rotator, well, rotates the cave. There are a series of practice caves included with the download so you can hone your skills.   Boulder Dash Tournaments for Prizes is not the best Atlas Mobile game for casual players. It's certainly a lot tougher than earlier offerings, making it a great download for more experienced gamers on the service. This isn't to say that newbies are shut out, but Boulder Dash Tournaments for Prizes is certainly a little more complex than, say, Ms. Pac-Man For Prizes.   Boulder Dash Tournaments for Prizes looks exactly like previous editions of Boulder Dash. The game screen is clean and clear, which is of utmost importance. The use of color is nice, too.  Boulder Dash Tournaments for Prizes is a good evolution for the line-up. Some games are too simple for more experienced players and Boulder Dash Tournaments for Prizes offers a good challenge. The random cave generation is a huge boon for the game because it levels the playing field to a degree. Sure, you may go up against another player with a lot more experience in game tactics, but at least they don't have the benefit of memorizing the caves. If you've played the hell out of your current Atlas Mobile studio offerings, Boulder Dash Tournaments for Prizes is a good next step.", "date": "May 26, 2005"}
