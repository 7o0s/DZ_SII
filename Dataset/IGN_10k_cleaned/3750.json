After all, half of this year's races are already behind us, and F1 fans around the world have long been clamoring to jump into the action and take their favorite driver across the finish line ahead of the pack.   While the jury is still out whether EA made the right decision to go with Juan Pablo Montoya as the cover boy for F1 Career Challenge (he is currently tied for fifth place with Rubens Barrichello), we just have to point out the irony that the first PS2 F1 game to actually feature an F1 star on the cover is also the first to de-emphasize the drivers and shift focus to the gamer.  Gameplay Take it as a taste of things to come: game publishers are all hot about making you -- the gamer -- the star of their games. After all, Neversoft is doing it with the next Tony Hawk, so it's bound to be one of the big, new trends this year. So instead of letting you pick Kimi Raikkonen and show frontrunner Michael Schumacher that McLaren's up to task this year, you create yourself a new rookie driver and make him a star. Not a bad idea -- on paper. Unfortunately, the execution of this new career mode, the nucleus of F1 Career Challenge, is far from perfect.   Let's get right to it: F1 Career Challenge's control and gameplay are up to par with last year's game -- as a matter of fact, they're nearly unchanged. Like with its predecessors, developer Visual Sciences has crafted a fun racing sim with a fantastic sense of speed and good controls. The AI remains formulaic, but works for the most part. At its best, it's challenging, with competitive drivers duking it out with you for a position in the points. The developers were smart to add a human touch to the AI drones and program in enough deliberate ~driver errors~ and equipment failures to provide for ever-changing, unpredictable races. For example, it's cool to see Ralf's engine starting to smoke when you've been trailing him for three rounds and then watch him slowly make his way to the pits as you take the lead. But there are also moments where the opposition will do puzzling things because it's simply not reactive enough. Stop your car anywhere on the track and look to the back and you will see many of the AI drivers stop behind you instead of simply swerving and overtaking -- even when there is plenty of room to pass. This type of ~on-rails~ AI flies in the face of the otherwise realistic on-track action. Luckily, the game's fast pace and otherwise competitive opponents quickly let you forget these inconsistencies.  As far as modes and features go, F1 Career Challenge may just be a reflection of the fact that Sony has nabbed the exclusive license of the sport in Europe for the next four years. Instead of a Grand Prix mode that lets you race as one of the 20 stars of the 2003 season, the game diverts you to the Career Mode, a new four-season mode where players ~create themselves and challenge the real-life F1 stars~. Only that you can't really create yourself. Unlike most of EA's sports offerings, F1 lacks a player creation tool, meaning this game's idea of personalization is letting you enter your name, choose your nationality, and pick one of five faces and three helmet designs. After you've ~created~ your rookie driver, you have to first pass a few drivers' tests to get yourself a Super License. Anyone who's played the previous F1 PS2 offerings will be on familiar territory, as these are essentially recycled from the 2001 edition (minus the tests you had to pass to unlock features like shifting, flags, and damage -- these are thankfully unlocked from the start).   The cockpit cam makes the game look almost like a real TV broadcast.  While the concept of a Career mode is excellent and the game really gives you the feel of slowly working your way up in the ranks, the actual presentation of this mode lacks soul. You receive offers from racing teams via the same generic PDA message, and apart from team colors and car handling there isn't much difference between driving for Benetton or for Ferrari (ask Michael Schumacher, there definitely should be a difference). After a race, you are rewarded with applause or jeers from your pit crew according to your race performance, but the presentation is so horrible, it'll make you chuckle more than anything. If you're doing well, your reputation points will go up and you will get new offers. Crash your car or fail to place in the points and you'll be moved to NASCAR. Just kidding.   On the upside, the representation of the race weekend is just as good as always. The qualifying event is still handled in realtime (you can wait in the pits for the right moment to go out and get your time) and changing weather conditions can bring on scenarios like with June 27's rainy practice session in Germany. Pitstops follow last year's ~interactive~ model, meaning your ability to quickly brake, turn, shift into first, and accelerate, affects your overall time in the pits. It's a nice way to put control into the player's hands, even though team-specific pitstop performance would have probably fit better into the whole career mode scheme. Car setup strangely got dumbed down over the last version. You can adjust steering, downforce, and gearbox ratio directly via sliders, which takes away the authenticity of adjusting the front and rear wings to change downforce, for example. We're also not sure why, but the ability to set custom ratios is gone, as are some of the custom control options for beginners, like traction control, ABS, and speed assists. Yes, we understand that it's a driver's career mode, but given the audience that plays this type of game (and the comparatively high difficulty), a little more attention paid to telemetry and car setup would have been nice.       The Career mode's saving grace is of course the ability to progress through four full F1 seasons. You'll get to race against Irvine's Ferrari in 1999, then face him in his Jaguar on 2000's newly added Indianapolis track. You'll see drivers come and go (Mika Salo taking over for Michael Schumacher after Silverstone 1999, for example), car models and decals change (sanitized of the cigarette advertisers, of course), and the only drivers missing from the GPs will be the ones who lost their car to you. It's an awesome feature for fans of the sport -- but it's really one that should appear in addition to a standard Grand Prix mode, not instead of it. Yes, it's sad but true: there is no way to race the 2003 season. The Quick Race mode lets you choose one of the F1 stars from the 1999-2002 seasons and race on a single track of your choice, but there really is no excuse to not have a standard 2003 GP mode (or at least the Custom Championship mode, if Sony's recent contract with the FIA precluded EA 100% from featuring the new roster of drivers).   Perhaps to make up for the missing GP and Challenge Modes, the developers added a slew of unlockables that you can ~buy~ in return for points earned during the races. These range from temporary engine upgrades and special race events to new pit girl costumes. A decent multiplayer split-screen mode (up to four players via multitap) rounds off what's essentially an upgrade and downgrade of last year's title.  Graphics It's tough to tell F1 Career Challenge from last year's F1 2002. Framerates are only mildly improved (still sub-30fps, but less jumpy), car models and tracks still look as good as last year, and if it wasn't for a cool, new glare effect, some new camera shakes and better depth and motion blurring, it'd be all too easy to confuse the two games with each other. If you've never played F1 2002, expect detailed car models, a great, TV-style default view that shows your driver's s helmet, reflections, realistic damage, excellent weather effects with rain hitting the virtual camera lens, a blur effect when driving on rumble strips, and a great looking cockpit view with working mirrors that really gives you a sense of the action (the cockpit displays in this mode are just for show, they don't actually work). Though sparks are once again missing, attention to detail otherwise remains exceptional. You can see your driver remove the tear-off strips from his helmet whenever his view gets clouded, dirt building up on your tires when you veer off-course, and the sun creating a very Splinter-Cell-esque glare on your car's hood.   Pit-crews are well-animated when you stop to change your tires or refuel, but once the helmets are off, it's over. The garage crew looks absolutely ridiculous. We're not sure if it's the vacant expressions or the way the face textures are applied to the models, but the crew creeps us out.   You have to see these strange creatures in motion to appreciate their oddness. We think they may have come to Earth to kidnap some F1 drivers for their home planet.  Other than this and the still spotty framerate, the realistic look and good effects leave a positive impression. HDTV owners will be happy to hear that the game supports a 16x9 widescreen setting.   Sound Not much has changed in the sound department over last year. The engine sounds are good at full speed, while the lower registers still sound fake. The sound effects for shifting, driving on the ~kitty litter~, and the subtle road noise you hear when you're driving alone are all right on the nose. The pit crew commentary doesn't appear to lag behind this time. Music is confined to the menus and very subdued, and that's pretty much it, unfortunately. Perhaps the developers ran out of space (the game ships on a CD), but there are no track intros or non-pit crew narration of any kind. It's sad to think that F1 Career Challenge could be the last Formula racing game we'll see from EA in a long time. With Sony in charge of the license in the territories that matter, EA's love affair with the sport seems to be over for now. The control and great feel in this PS2 racing franchise are the culmination of several years of tweaking. It's too bad that for every new addition to the series other features got cut -- and some other issues, like AI and framerate, weren't more of a priority. As a returning player, I'm disappointed about the absence of 2003 data, or at least a proper Grand Prix mode that lets you drive an entire season as the stars of the sport. Last year's introduction of the Challenge Mode was great, why is it gone from this edition? I'm also somewhat puzzled over the weak presentation in the Career mode, usually the strongest part of any EA Sports game. It's just so... sterile. Add to that the lack of features and you've got a game that drives slightly better than previous versions, but still falls short of expectations. If you don't own any of the previous versions, F1 Career Challenge is a solid racing simulation that may be frustrating to get a handle of at first, but offers up many rewarding hours of gameplay. The ability to race the previous four seasons is awesome and the sense of speed is simply unparalleled. F1 Career Challenge is a typical case of ~one step forward, two steps back~. Here's hoping that EA can leverage the concept of the career mode for its other racing games, like NASCAR, and flesh it out without cutting back on overall features. Until then, give this game a look if you're itching to play a good racing sim. Just don't expect to be able to use it to predict the outcome of the current racing season.", "date": "Jun 28, 2003"}
