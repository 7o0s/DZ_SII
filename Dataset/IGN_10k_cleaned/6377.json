This sugary-sweet, cute-as-a-button action-puzzle title swallowed up so much time here it's a wonder it was never outlawed.  Bust-a-Move 4 (Acclaim will be releasing Bust-a-Move 3 as Bust-a-Move '99 next year) builds on the successful design of the first two games, where you're given a stack of bubbles of different colors. One by one you toss colored bubbles up to the stack, trying to connect three bubbles of the same color. If you do, they disappear, sometimes causing a few to fall. Clear the board, get to the next level. Easy as that. Problem is, the stack of bubbles falls down a notch every few turns, and if a bubble falls passed the bottom of the board, it's game over.  The idea has gotten a few enhancements in each of the sequels, and Bust-A-Move 4 adds a handful as well. New to the series are Chain Reactions, where in VS mode (against the CPU or another player), if you cause a few bubbles to fall from your stack, the falling bubbles will seek out two of its own color and connect with them, making them disappear as well. In a successful chain reaction, you can potentially wipe your board clean of all the bubbles. In the single player rounds, pulleys enter into the design  two sides of a rope have their own set of bubbles. Causing one side's bubbles to disappear will lower the other side, and you'll need to keep a healthy balance before one side drops beyond the line.  Also included is the ability to make your own boards and save them to a memory card. See if your friends can beat your best designs. And with the DexDrive, you can download your buddies' own levels off the Net. Pretty nifty.  Bust-a-Move isn't entirely a puzzle game, since it still requires quick hand-eye coordination of a shooter. Still, it's always been a favorite of mine. Unfortunately, the new chain-reactions of this sequel are a bit too much and take away from the overall simplistic nature of the game.Sure, you can keep your eye out and stack together two bubbles together in hopes that you'll create a chain reaction, but most of the time its entirely random, and you can wipe your board clean without the necessary effort of the past couple of games.On the other hand, the pulley system really adds to the game design of the single player modes. You now have to think before you shoot, because if you overload one side with bubbles, you're screwed.As a two-player game, Bust-a-Move 4 disappoints  so keep a hold onto your copy of Bust-a-Move 2 (or wait until Bust-a-Move 3 comes out). But the single-player puzzle games are the main attraction this time. Taking this into account, Bust-a-Move 4 is just fine. Got that? One player, good. Two player, not so good.", "date": "Dec 18, 1998"}
