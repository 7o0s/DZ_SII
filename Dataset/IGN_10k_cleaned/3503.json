The company prides itself on bringing its Wrestlemania, Raw, and Smackdown franchises to the GameCube, Xbox, and PS2 respectively, and it does so with repeated success. With latest WWE licensed package known as  Crush Hour though, some returning fans might be thrown for a loop. It says WWE on the box, but we'll be damned if there's a lick of grappling, punching, or ear biting anywhere to be found. Instead, the company has tasked a small percentage of its staff for a surprising turn in the car combat arena.   With WWE Crush Hour GameCube and PS2 players can now take control of the Rock and dish out bruises with side-mounted lasers and rocket launchers! Surely, elbow drops and clotheslines are effective and everything, but is there anything so wrong with slapping this license on a more unusual product?  Perhaps, yes, but then again, Crush Hour has actually turned out to be a little on the entertaining side.   Admittedly, it's easy to hate this game if you don't know anything about it. WWE wrestling fans that are hardcore about their THQ titles are instantly going to oppose the idea of mixing their favorite stars with something so different. On the flipside, car combat purists who have been glued to other superior titles such as the Twisted Metal franchise might glimpse the fancy WWE logo and scoff at the ridiculous marriage between sweaty superstars and hulking hotrods. These are the factors that WWE Crush Hour has going against it from the outset, and it is for these very reasons that THQ must be commended in some strange, bizarre way for daring to be so bold.   Gameplay  From the beginning we should state that Crush Hour's explosive vehicular combat doesn't quite match-up with other great genre games. It's noticeably shallow in control, in weapons variety, special moves, destructible terrain, and many other categories in which it should excel. And comparing it side-by-side with the likes of a vastly superior title like Twisted Metal Black would be a sad and ugly devastation. But what Crush Hour does offer, it offers it surprisingly well.    For starters, the WWE license is actually used appropriately, with over 20 controllable players (some of which must be unlocked in the career mode) who sport his or her own personalized intro music and movie clips before each match. And since some of these cars are convertibles, you can even catch a glimpse of certain wrestlers as they move their heads along with the action. Additionally, you're treated to 3D animated headshots of the current contestants who holler and taunt you as they blast your ride into flaming bits and Jim Ross is on the microphone giving WWE fans a taste of ~the twisty rockets!~ Crush Hour really tries to push its presentation aspects, and its efforts are admirable.   Once the match begins, each wrestler's vehicle is rated in one of four categories -- control, strength, defense, and speed -- so you'll notice a difference between a souped-up hot rod and an ultra-beefy semi truck. It's really a nice bonus to be able to browse the collection of fighters and pick out the ride that best suits your strategy and the physics that go along with each are pretty satisfying and realistic. Players will ultimately spend most of their time performing nitro boosts and circle strafing around arenas blasting with their primary canons and secondary power-ups and the action presents itself as fast, furious, and reasonably fun.   Unfortunately, the game's biggest flaw is its lack of depth. Sure, there are different WWE-themed arenas with varying objectives such as ~destroy 10 opponents~ or ~hold the belt for 30 seconds,~ but gameplay doesn't get any more complex or diverse than that. There's a small assortment of weapon upgrades to snag during combat for sure, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to discover that having more for your arsenal would have been a better idea. To its credit, the environments are varied and acceptably large in some areas, but they're also completely non-interactive; unless you want to count stage-based traps that is. But even those are blatantly obvious and easily avoidable.    The difficulty setting is also a bit of a pushover as the ~career mode~ can be completed rather effortlessly. Should you need to find your damage elsewhere though, the game does manage to support a few standard multiplayer modes. Considering that the entire game is nothing more than a simple arena deathmatch shooter, it would have helped immensely to see the inclusion of a four-player option. Sticking with two players isn't bad, but it definitely hinders Crush Hour's potential as a mindless but worthy time killer.   Graphics  Crush Hour's 3D driving engine moves along at a sufficient 30 frames per second thanks to its lack of serious detail and visual effects. Explosions and particles aren't terribly exciting, as you'll see smoke and flares that are puffy, patchy, and blurry drifting through the action. The textures are medium quality, being neither offensive nor terribly attractive, but riding that safe middle ground that affords the game its speedy thrills.   Some environments are plainly decorated, with blank gray walls bending angularly around a hallway interior or a flat, compressed, and poorly animated crowd of WWE spectators twitching in the bleachers. But Crush Hour shines where it must: fairly detailed vehicles, and a fast enough sense of speed to keep you hitting the start button round after round.   Sound  For a car combat game, Crush Hour leaves one wondering if there's truly any combat going on at all -- or if you've fallen asleep with your head in the ocean again.  Sound effects are unsatisfactorily muffled and tend to jumble onto one another in an inaudible grind of noise. To top it all off, none of it is particularly crisp or vibrant, leaving your ears tired and weary from the blaring hiss.   This low audio quality mark is consistent for just about everything your ears must endure, including the robotic in-game commentary by Jim Ross. If you're buying this game because of its extremely cheap price sticker, then don't bother plugging it into your expensive, high-end audio system.Blending genres is always an interesting thing, and so is taking a popular license such as the WWE and translating it to a gaming genre other than wrestling. But THQ has done exactly that with Crush Hour, and frankly, the end result could have been much, much worse. The game is entirely playable, and for the price you pay (only $19.99 brand new), it's well worth the money. If you're like me, you keep a few games handy for those quick action fixes -- those moments when you just want to fire something up and enjoy a quick round of ass kicking. WWE Crush Hour is a worthy title of such an honor. It's extremely simple; so don't expect to keep this one spinning into the summer months. Though it does manage to fill a gamer's need to race around madly and blow things up. If you're a WWE fan, then the licensed wrestlers, voices, and intro music alone is well worth the money. And despite being an inferior car combat product, gamers who have a few bucks to burn and half an hour or so per day could find that Crush Hour may be worth the investment.", "date": "Mar 18, 2003"}
