First there was the Xcrement of 3Xtreme and the equally EXTREME!ly bad Courier Crisis. Then we saw a throng of motorcross titles get jumbled up in the pack. Codemasters hoped to burn the flock with a killer biking game -- real physics, customizable bikes, and sharp play control. In some areas, they've succeeded. But for the most part, No Fear Downhill Mountain Bike Racing is running on flat tires.   Gameplay Eight long and diverse international tracks (based somewhat on real-world locations, including San Francisco's Telegraph Hill and New Zealand's Matukituki Rapids), eight riders (not based on real racers, but still ranked in varying skills), and numerous customizations available for the bikes (including frame, tire, brake, suspension, and gear ratio modifications) -- there's a lot to dig in No Fear Downhill. It's a rough game (especially so in the needlessly tough amateur mode), but the courses are all diverse runs that will require plenty of practice no matter what your skill level is. What's questionable is whether players will be willing to give the game that much time -- some aspects grow on you once you get deep into the game, but most will give up long before they get there.  For instance, the stress in realism has made the control a matter of taste and temper. What No Fear Downhill has going for it is that it doesn't play at all like a car racer, and players will have to adjust to this. While there is no manual pedaling option (which would have added rhythm and physical effort to the game), the game does feature some very logical elements of biking. Riders have a strength meter, and winning is a matter of conserving your energy for when you need it while maintaining speed at all times. They can stand and pedal harder at the expense of strength, or tuck down and cruise down the hills (just watch out for turns while ducking, as your center of gravity is off). Bikes turn sharply at low speeds, while high speed corners must be negotiated with leaning turns or a rear brake slide. Smart racers will have to strike a balance between breakneck speed and cautious terrain traversing.  However, even experts still won't be fully stoked on the control. We'll ignore the limp trick system as a mistaken afterthought, but the features that do affect control still disappoint. No Fear has options coming out of its hot pants, from the rider stats down to the bike mods, but most of that is moot when you're actually racing. Either the options have minimal effect or they're so no-brainer decisions that options aren't really optional (try using slick tires in the snow course). Standing and ducking are controlled by holding either up or down, which is tough to do while steering (and the analog control is too mushy to rely on). Turns are never sharp enough, especially right angles, and the bikes rarely slide like real bikes can. The manual states, ~The best riders take corners in speedway fasion; sideways with one foot down.~ Unfortunately, the shoulder buttons aren't used to control lean (or for any useful purpose at all, for that matter), so this kind of fearless racing is rarely a part of an actual race.  (NOTE: We called the developers on this one to find out what's up with the lack of fishtail turns and knee-grinding leans. It seems this was a developer's decision, as they felt that slippery control wouldn't differentiate the game enough from the glut of other racers out there. They wanted to steer you towards the tactical stop-and-start racing more common in the sport, so players will not be able to rely on just holding the accelerator all the way through the game. EA's Supercross 2000 took the same approach. So, for better or worse, that's the game.)  The tracks are equally hit and miss. While the addition of customized runs for each skill level was brilliant, the courses themselves are the most frustrating and heartless since Jet Moto 2's mine stage. Right angles and 180 degree turns take all the speed out of races. Even worse, tracks are littered with building alleyways, jutting storefronts and fences, and other obstacles to get stuck in -- if riders could get off the bike and run a bit, you would be able to get out of a bad corner, but with only a wheelie option players will have to wait until their speed is gone and their stamina is back up before they can get out of some sticky spots. Some environments have features you can't ride on, so in the volcano level there will be lots of rocks that are shrot enough to clear with a good pop, and yet riders are forced to go around them. And in contrast to the actual sport, tracks are very narrow and limiting -- on ESPN, Downhill events are often shown on open courses with moguls and multiple riders; in this game, it's head-to-head on slim tracks, often with only exactly one line to cut to win.  Graphics Clean but basic, with a few key crises. Nothing's particularly beautiful here (you get what you'd expect, although you don't get what's on the box -- those are processed shots, plain as day), so I'll focus on what affects the gameplay. The graphic engine draws in closely, but that rarely matters on these twisting courses. What does affect the game is the pixilated nature of the arrow signs, which make knowing where to go a matter of guesswork and practice. The game is also dark way too often, sometimes to the point where you can't even see your rider much less the track. All of this is tripled in the choppy two player mode -- only a few courses are worth trying here. There are also few special effects to speak of in the game. On one hand, that makes sense, but seeing gondolas stand still in the snow level just isn't impressive. The bottom line is, the graphics are utilitarian at best, and even then they don't fully do the job.  Sound Like the graphics, the sound is barely adequate. The biggest anchor in the audio is that the sound engine is buggy and underpowered -- sounds cut out abruptly and rarely overlap. Far too few sound channels are used, and if you turn the music on, you lose one of those channels. Environment effects are almost non-existent, with the occasional frog croak or crowd cheer in an otherwise empty soundtrack. Even the digi-pop music tracks are low quality, although some of the tracks do have nice grooves. The only good sounds are the panting breath of tired riders and the whir of the bike while coasting.And still the only good game on two wheels. Mixed message? Sure. But, at least from a practical standpoint, that's true. Racing in the game is exactly like racing a bike on real tracks, where conservation of energy is just as important as bolting out of the gate. That's different from any dirt bike racer or Supercross title, and that makes the game have a wholly original feel that hasn't been done in other games. Control of the bike is very definitely at the front at low speeds, in the rear at max speed. I can't say that makes No Fear Downhill Mountain Bike Racing a great game, but it's certainly a start for a sport that deserves a worthy game.  Once I got deep into the game, things started to make sense to me as far as the design and where the realism factors in. I just can't see others giving this game the same patience. If Codemasters can shuck off the bulky graphic and sound engines next time, they may have something worth a ride. Until then, however, this is a game for only bicycling enthusiasts.", "date": "Jan 8, 2000"}
