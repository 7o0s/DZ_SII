Since the age of three, I've been a huge fan of wrestling and the WWF in particular. I've seen all there is to see in Vince's big promotion, from Hulk Hogan to Stone Cold to The Rock. It may be a coincidence, but I also became a huge videogame fan right around the same time I got into wrestling. Playing River Raid or Asteroids on one TV, while watching Andre the Giant whip the hell out of Big John Studd on our other set was commonplace in the Dunham household -- and whenever these two great hobbies of mine got together, I was there to experience it.   From Pro Wrestling to Tecmo World Wrestling, all the way on up to the more contemporary offerings of Fire Pro and WCW vs. the World -- you name it, I've played it. I've battled though the 8-bit simplicity that was M.U.S.C.L.E. and suplexed and body-slammed my way through session after session of Power Move Pro Wrestling. Over the last couple of years, Acclaim has stepped forward as the leader among Americanized grapplers and has given us some solid choices to pass the time away. Erasing the memory of the lackluster 2D effort WWF In Your House, WWF Warzone and WWF Attitude all but dominated the N64 and PlayStation sales charts when they made their respective debuts. Providing fans with the opportunity to play as their favorite superstar in complete three-dimensional glory, the two games have taken off as 1990's success stories.   Just weeks removed from losing its WWF license to THQ (and amid speculation that the game would never see the light of day), Acclaim's Dreamcast version of WWF Attitude has actually made it to shelves. For those of you that waited, you'll probably be glad that you did.    Right from the start, WWF Atttitude presents itself like an actual WWF program. Not only is the familiar snippet that opens every WWF show tagged as the opening cinema for the game, but also the Raw is War music that will kick your speakers' ass. Showing a multitude of high-impact moves and some aerial ring wizardry, the real-life footage is a nicely-directed homage to wrestling and its more recent hardcore direction. Interestingly enough, the tribute to the tragically deceased Owen Hart found at the end of the PlayStation version is mysteriously absent. Strange.   Following the cinema, you're taken to an options screen -- and man, there are a lot of options. If I describe every possible match and setting here it would take all day (and since you need most of the day to play your Dreamcast, I won't do it). To sum up, you can wrestle in just about every imaginable way including War matches, Gauntlet matches, Triple Threat matches, Cage matches... hell, fireplace matches are probably in there somewhere! You can even create your own pay-per-view event and put together as many specialty fights as you want. Unfortunately, there is no Hell in a Cell or Casket match option, which is actually pretty disappointing since, as we all know, some of the best matches in WWF history took place in the Hell in the Cell (need I remind you of Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels, or when Mankind took on the Taker? Good stuff!). Oh well, at least the First Blood match made it in.   Once you pick the type of bout you want, it's on to choosing a superstar (or a ~young stud~ as good old JR would say), and there are a ton of them to choose from. Almost every major WWF wrestler from the last 3 years is in here, with 4 different costume options for each. Want to choose Triple H is his old ~Greenwich Snob~ outfit? Go right ahead! Think Kane would look better in his mostly-black uniform? The choice is yours.   After selecting your grappler and following a mere four or five seconds of load time (this is considerably shorter than previous versions), you're witness to one of the coolest features of the game (and probably one of its biggest selling points): The ring entrances. Yes, from Al Snow's maniacal prance to the ring holding his severed mannequin head to The Rock's slow jaunt into the squared circle, everyone is a true-to-life representation of themselves. Even the entire 4-5 minute theme track for each character is played in full stereo. It's definitely one of my favorite aspects of WWF Attitude.   You don't have to wrestle individual matches, and can, if you wish, go straight into a full career. Starting off at house shows and working your way up to Shotgun Saturday Nights, Heats, Raws, and finally, the pay-per-views, you can take your personality all the way to three different titles, the European, Intercontinental, and World Championships. And, of course, you'll unlock secrets along the way...   THE feature of attitude, however, has to be the Create-A-Wrestler mode. With this utility, only your imagination is the limit. There are an unbelievable amount of choices at your disposal; you can create a combatant all the way down to the very last detail, from how his or her eyes look, to their fighting style, to their theme music. Want to make a WCW jobber (or perhaps even yourself) and pit the new character against a monster of the WWF? You can! You'll probably find yourself spending hours and hours on this feature alone.   So, what about improvements over previous cross-platform versions of the game? The first and most obvious fix is the graphics. Far and above the clipped mess that was the PlayStation disc, and tighter all around when compared to the Nintendo 64 cartridge, the Dreamcast offering looks much better. Textures are more realistic and the seams between joints in the limbs are harder to spot. While there is occasional draw-in and clipping, it doesn't even come close to the horrendous amount found in the PSX edition of Attitude.   Also improved is the crowd. In prior versions, the audience was nothing more than a jumbled three-frame blob moving in unison to an unknown beat. Now, you can clearly make out each and every fan that moves independently of the others. Some of them even hold signs just like in real life (sadly, there are none of the ~joke~ signs commonly associated with wrestling crowds). The Undertaker's mist effects, everyone's pyrotechnics, and especially fire (found in Gangrel or Kane's entrance) looks as real as ever, instantly reminding you why you'd want to play this on the Dreamcast in the first place.   Of course, every rose has its thorn and that means that WWF Attitude isn't without its issues. For starters, we have the control. Admittedly, it's the most responsive in comparison to previously-released versions, but certain aspects can still be somewhat bothersome. Ready moves (holds pulled off while standing still) are easy to perform as are the ground maneuvers, but in every other situation it seems near-impossible to pull something off. Once in a grapple, the more advanced techniques are all but thrown out the door, and you'll find yourself putting your opponent in countless armbars. For some reason, tapping the better moves while is rarely fruitful.   Also problematic is the match pace against CPU opponents. Because of the aforementioned grapple problems, most bouts end the same way no matter whom you choose: Punch, punch, kick, punch, some kind of slam, kick, another slam, and your finisher -- match over. Not to say that the game is any less fun, but after using the same technique over and over again despite your wrestler pick, AI battles become disappointing.   The most frustrating aspect I found in the Dreamcast Attitude, however, was getting back into the ring. No matter how many countless times I tried, I just could not get myself to climb the cage consistently, or just get back onto the canvas from the show floor. I think out of around 70-80 matches, I only managed to succeed twice. It had me so frustrated, that eventually I didn't leave the ring anymore, and for me, that took a lot away from the fun.   The other gripes I have are on the small side, and primarily deal with the game being out of date. Most WWF marks like me, for example, will probably be angered that Chris Jericho, The Big Show, Hardcore Holly, and the Hardy Boyz aren't in the game. Especially baffling is the Hardy's, who did the motion capture. Why did Acclaim leave them out when they were in the studio so much? And while Hardcore Holly and The Big Show are quite easily made in the Create-A-Wrestler feature, putting together a believable Chris Jericho isn't so easy. Not to mention their lack of theme music blaring in the background. Speaking of Theme music, why does ~Dr. Death~ Steve Williams have Dan ~The Beast~ Severn's entrance tune? He had is own when he was in the WWF, just like everyone else. I find it odd indeed that there is no Severn, but his music is in there, while Steve Williams is present, but his music isn't.   Also worth mentioning is that Triple H comes out to his old D-X entrance instead of the darker ring walk that he has now and it's also strange to see Val Venis talking into his hand as if he has a microphone when he doesn't. With three months time between the release of this and the previous versions, you'd think Acclaim could change a theme song or two. Or show the titles that you have won around your wrestlers waist (or show them at all), or at least add my man Y2J! I'm also peeved that once you play a career with one wrestler, there's nothing new to discover with the other wrestlers. The predecessor to Attitude, WWF Warzone, unlocked certain secrets depending on your wrestler choice, and added extra incentive to using everyone. Not this time.   Which leads me to my last grievance, it's that there's nothing new in the Dreamcast version of WWF Attitude. Besides the improved graphics and slightly better animation, it's the same game, leaving a lot of fans that planned on getting the DC rev as a companion to their current PSX or N64 game wondering whether or not they should. By comparison, even the upcoming WrestleMania 2000 for the N64 has added Titantron videos to every entrance. Why couldn't Acclaim do that here? There are no Dreamcast exclusives, no added wrestlers, options, themes, or any such thing. There is simply nothing new.Gripes aside, if you rented this for another system and liked it or have been patiently waiting for the Dreamcast edition before buying, this is the still the definitive version of WWF Attitude. The  improved look, the fun of pounding on a buddy (two-player mode is where the game really shines), and the endless amount of time you can spend creating your own oversized drop-kicker makes Acclaim's last effort in the world of Vinnie Mac a good one.", "date": "Nov 10, 1999"}
