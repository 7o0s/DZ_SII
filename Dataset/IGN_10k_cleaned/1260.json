Or most of it, anyway. Elite Force makes it cool to like Star Trek again, it's so much fun, and it places Raven in the exalted position of not only crafting two fantastic shooters in one year (the other being Soldier of Fortune), but making people actually purchase a Star Trek title without having to hide it under their knee length black trenchcoats, or long ponytails for those of you living in the world's more hot and humid areas.  To recap the first impressions:   Geeky is good Light beam weapons=great Wild variety of play styles Nice plot-based structure   I was really, really impressed with the game after having played it for a few hours, particularly the beautiful light effects of the weapons, as well as the fantastic graphics and loose-fitting storyline that constantly turned in new directions as you played through a level. How did the title hold up after finishing it? You'll just have to read on.   I got myself in the mood for this review last night by watching some episode of Voyager where Barclay tries to communicate with Voyager from Starfleet Command on Earth, and all I can say is, thank god Raven kicked some life into the storyline. After watching the show fairly regularly for a couple of years now, I was more than a little worried that Elite Force would reflect the sort of lost, sappy, meandering madness that the Star Trek universe has become on recent shows. By putting the characters in close contact with a variety of races, and by creating the ~Hazard Team,~ a special group of security operatives sent in to handle dicey situations, the Star Trek universe gets a much-need kick in the pants from the ~wow, the Doctor can sing opera!~ slant of storytelling that's been killing the series over the past couple of years. By the time you're done you'll see rip-offs of Predator, Starship Troopers, and Aliens come before the sizzling muzzle of your phaser weapons, and while on the series that may come across as heavy-handed, in an action-oriented setting they're just what you need for good, clean fun. Parent alert: Just so you know, the Elite Force characters give long speeches about getting along and loving each other before resorting to blowing stuff up. That makes it OK... I think. Well they're monster aliens anyway, and Xenophobia is still legal in 49 states.color>  After playing through the first few sections of the game, I was more than impressed with how the storyline branched out in new directions, and most of the game follows that formula. Just as with the first few levels, you'll be doing a variety of tasks -- taking out shield protectors, saving teammates, turning on gravity in giant ship bays. Because you'll spend the latter half of the game with a team of people assisting you, you'll be figuring out puzzles together, not just blasting through door X. In fact, that's one of the cool things about Elite Force-- you'll rarely, if ever, have to resort to finding a switch to open a specific door. Instead, you'll have situations such as one on a Borg vessel where one of your team works on breaking a force field open while you and your teammates work hard to protect them from a constant Borg onslaught. Other teammates will open doors for you, give you advice on where to go next, command you, or just plain chide you for bad behavior. Tuvok, I hate you.   The weapons aren't impressive in variety, but they are a blast to use, due to the Phaser-based look and feel of them. Handheld Proton Torpedoes fire gargantuan light blasts at enemies, Arc Welders spray out electricity like a lightning gun over nearby foes, and even the wimpy Phaser does a better job of fraying enemies than other games where you're stuck with a crowbar, a wrench, or a gauntlet to keep you happy. For the most part the weapons stick to the standard Quake formula, but visually they're bright, wild, and eye-popping enough to give you the satisfied you need, especially given that you aren't going to be blowing aliens into bloody bits like you would in your average fragfest.  The graphics and music also impress throughout the adventure. Since most of the cast makes an appearance in the game (sans the voice talent of Jeri Ryan), you'll hear commentary from all your favorites, as well as in-game and between-level chatter from the members of the Hazard Team that you'll grow to hate, love, and depend on throughout the game. Sound effects are lifted right from the series (even the old series... but I won't spoil you with any details), so as you'd expect they're perfect. Music is pretty solid as well, but again, it's the sounds of phasers, turbolifts, and com signals that will have you giddy in the game. Graphics are as incredible as Soldier of Fortune, with dynamic lighting, solid level design, and great character detail (ignoring the fact that none of the actual Voyager cast looks quite right). Plus, since you've got a personal transporter from which you pull all your weapons, there's finally a logical explanation for how someone can hold a laser, a rocket launcher, and an Arc Welder in their back pocket.  So all of this sounds great, right? It is... but there is a downside, and that's the size and scope of the game. While you'll visit a good number of environments, and you'll go through a movie-plot of dialogue and storyline, you'll also blow through the title in a couple of days of solid playing. It's definitely shorter than your average shooter, and if you're not a multiplayer gamer, you may find this game on your shelf in less than a week. If you are into multiplayer gaming, however, we're happy to say that while it's not revolutionary, it's definitely a solid experience. We played a few days worth of deathmatch and capture the flag, and had a blast -- with some minor gripes. The levels aren't as tight as Quake III or Unreal Tournament, and the weapons are sometimes less useful than you'd like them to be in a full-on battle with human opponents, but compared to a lot of multiplayer modes on the market, this one is definitely a crowd pleaser. Especially if you've ever wanted to shoot Neelix with a rocket.  Fans of the Star Trek series will enjoy finally being able to take an active part in the universe they've loved for so long (though they will probably groan at the A-Team style final section of the game), and fans of shooters in general will finally have a reason to break out their well-rehearsed keyboard/mouse stance. Unfortunately, given that the game is fairly short overall, non-rabid Star Trek fans may feel like a little cut off when they finish the game quicker than expected. But is it worth it for the overall experience? Definitely. Beam this one down using the tractor phaser from your local space mart. Or something.   -- Vincent Lopez      Want to share your opinions with the world? Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  or send some mail to IGNPC about this story.", "date": "Sep 20, 2000"}
