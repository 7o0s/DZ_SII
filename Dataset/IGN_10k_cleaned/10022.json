Spin-offs and reuses of the same brand name, sure, but 2's and 3's don't often make the cut in the titles of subsequent installments. Columns III: Revenge of Columns is an exception to the rule.    This third take on the early Genesis puzzler Columns was positioned and marketed as a direct sequel to its predecessor, and sought to recapture the audience that loved the original Columns by mixing up the formula that worked so well the first time around. But it didn't really work this time. Columns III adds too much, subtracts some of the good, screws up the balance of the gameplay, and ends up providing a great example of why successful puzzle games rarely get numbered sequels -- because if you got it right the first time, it's hard to mess with that perfection.   Columns III offers up an array of cartoon opponents, like this slightly sleepy spider. The premise behind the Columns series' puzzle design is that you've got an open, empty pit that fills with pieces that fall from the top of the screen, similar to Tetris. But the pieces here come in groups of three, and are always aligned in three-tall vertical columns. The trick is to rotate and position these columns in such a way that three or more like-colored pieces (or jewels) line up vertically, horizontally or on a diagonal. If you manage to do that, the matching jewels disappear and any pieces left hanging out above them fall down into the open gaps below.   The original appearance of this design was praiseworthy when it arrived in 1990, because the effect of gravity that forced pieces to fall down and fill in gaps emphasized creating combos and chains of multiple clears at once. No other puzzle game had done that before, and it's become an influential factor for the genre since. Getting good at setting up multiple moves was the only way to achieve the highest scores in the first Columns.   In Columns III, though, creating chains and combos is repurposed and fuels a different goal -- it increases your attack potential. Columns III's gameplay is built on the same foundation as before, but the whole jewel-smashing experience has been retooled as a series of one-on-one versus matches instead of a single-player, single-pit approach. Like Kirby's Avalanche or Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, you've always got an opponent taking up space on the right side of the screen and working against you, trying to force you to fail by pushing your stack of jewels up toward the top of the screen.   Creating chains and combos increases a numbered meter, and for every 10 jewels you clear you're allowed to assault your opponent with one shove of their stack up to the top. The attack simultaneously lowers your stack if it's been pushed up previously, making it both offensive and defensive at once.   This is all well and good, and seems a perfectly acceptable evolution of design for the Columns series. The problem is that it makes things far too frantic. The point of the game changes from contemplative and relatively calm combo planning to a manic rush to get the next 10 jewels cleared before your opponent does, lest they be able to attack you before you can hit them with a preemptive strike. It wouldn't be so bad if Columns III offered the original single-player endless mode from the first Columns, where you could play by yourself and have a fine and peaceful time stacking jewels -- but it doesn't. An opponent is always there, no matter which mode you choose.   And there's more added on top of all this, in the form of flashing jewels and magic jewels. These specialized power pieces appear as an occasional reward for creating good combos, and can be used to further devastate your opponent by pushing up their stack some more, turning all of their pieces black and white or some other such nonsense. But all your foe has to do is activate one of their own stored 10-jewel stack attacks and your special power piece is pulverized on the spot. It's rare that they'll appear, but even more exceedingly rare that you'll actually have the chance to use them. They're essentially pointless.   Last of all worth mentioning is Columns III's support for five simultaneous players, which is a feature that isn't unheard of since it has been seen a handful of times before (in games like Bomberman '93). If you can manage to round up five Wii people, you can experience a fairly satisfactory and competitive multiplayer combat mode. But the number of people who'd even attempt to make use of such a feature is so low that it can hardly be much of a positive selling point.Columns III: Revenge of Columns is a capable puzzler in many respects, but falls well short of the appeal of its own predecessor. You'd be better off spending your money on the original Columns. It's a better version of the same idea, as this retooling into a constant one-on-one versus puzzler just isn't as much fun as taking on the stack yourself. But don't feel bad, Columns III.
