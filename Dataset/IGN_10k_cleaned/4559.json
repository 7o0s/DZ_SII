Long ago said to be ~Grand Space Auto~, chiseled ex-Ranger Mace Griffin is far from being a rockstar. Mace Griffin: Bounty Hunter is a mixture of good and bad, a prime example of the Ying and Yang of game design. But is there enough good in here to merit withstanding the bad? Read on and find out!   Gameplay  Mace Griffin: Bounty Hunter is, surprise surprise, set in the future. It's a time where, apparently, everyone likes to live in asteroids instead of on planets. A time when outlaws are hunted by bounty hunters, as opposed to government regulators. Our hero, Mace Griffin, is a grizzled hunter of bounties, a former Ranger (galactic police force recently disbanded), who gets the ol' screw job and must figure out who set him up and why. The mystery and the plot Mace uncovers is poorly told and pretty boring. The cut-scenes, which are almost always showing Mace standing and talking to someone for long, drawn-out exposition, are great fun to skip.    Because Mace Griffin has no multiplayer or game elements beyond the single-player campaign, a deep and involving story is one ingredient that must be present. It's not here. This is a poorly told, uninteresting, and cliched tale of revenge that doesn't even appear to be about revenge for the majority of the game.   Ground and space merge  The hooplah over Mace has been in full-effect for some time. This is a first-person shooter that blends ground and space combat together and weaves the two aspects throughout almost every mission. You may, for example, have to infiltrate a slave mine, rescue a prisoner, and then take control of your ship, fly into space and take down swarms of enemy ships. All of that comes without transition. You walk into your ship, the Pallbearer, to the cockpit, and grab hold of the throttle. At any point in time you can let go of the controls, get up and leave the cockpit. Pretty damn cool idea. Too bad Warthog did nothing interesting with it.   When we were originally shown Mace, it was touted as Grand Theft Auto in space. The end product shares nothing in common with GTA. This is a 100% linear game where your path through a mission is simple to find since there's rarely more than one accessible door or entryway at any time. While you will get to board another ship and kill the crew, this is a scripted event. You can't suddenly decide to leave the New Denver space colony and take off for parts unknown in your ship. You have to play by the rules. You never go far in your spaceship, just enough to dogfight some baddies or dock in a space station. All necessary long distance travel is handled in cut-scenes.   There would have been nothing cooler than to be able to fly throughout the Mace galaxy on my own time, or to hop from ship to ship, jacking people like a true space pirate. But in the final product, you'll rarely fly anything but the Pallbearer and even when you do fly another ship, it's only for a short period of time, while it serves the story.    This is the final frontier?  The space combat itself is decent, if not overly enthralling. Warthog is best known for bringing Starlancer to the Dreamcast. The space combat is similar to this excellent Dreamcast game, but less complex. The simplicity of space combat makes it feel hollow. It's fun, sure, chasing down ships zipping by, but it's just too easy. Even in the later levels, when there are dozens of ships attacking at once, the threat of dying is never prevalent. What should be dramatic dogfights turn into a matter of outrunning pursuers and shooting constantly. Space never felt so two-dimensional. But this is actually the fun part of the game. It simply lacks execution.    Grounded  About 80% of the game takes place on the ground. Like any other first-person shooter, Mace comes equipped with a variety of gadgets, from your standard machinegun/grenade launcher combo to more interesting weapons like... no, wait, all of the guns are pretty typical and the only gun that could have stood out, the sonic blaster, is really just a rip-off from the Unreal series.   The guns look cool, but they are all pretty standard stuff. Heck, even the triple-repeating handgun is nothing new -- it's lifted from Robocop. And as if that weren't enough, Mace uses the Halo form of health. Mace has a shield, which must be drained before he takes real damage. Avoid damage for a few seconds and the shield automatically regenerates. Looks like no one has to wait for Halo 2 after all!   Progressing through levels is relatively simple. You're given an objective, but there's little mystery in how the objective is solved. Just follow the yellow brick road and kill everything along the way. Sure there are switches to hit and levers to pull, but there are no branching pathways. Many hallways spring off in multiple directions, but all but one lead to near-instant dead-ends.   Simple go and kill gameplay isn't the worst thing in the world, as long as the rest of the game remains interesting. And, for much of Mace things are interesting -- at least from a killing standpoint. Almost all levels equate to entering a room, killing everything in the room, and then moving on to the next room to do the same. However, to the game's credit, Warthog merely drops you in the room with baddies in various positions (maybe five baddies on the ground, two snipers hiding in a building to the right, and some guy with a rocket launcher trying to blow you up from a walkway to the left. You need to kill them all, but how you do it is up to you.    There are many places where you can run and gun or snipe, or be sneaky and try to blow everyone up with some well-placed sticky grenades. The mixture of run and gun and sniping elements are pretty impressive. There are so many situations where enemies come from various locations with various weapons requiring instant strategies. Snipers will pin you down while ground troops will attempt to surround you. Smart stuff that makes for a tough, but mostly enjoyable experience.   I'll trade your Ying for my Yang  The enemy AI is about half good and half bad. There are many instances where an enemy makes a smart retreat or attempts to flank Mace. But then there are also lots of times where the AI bugs come out in full force. Some enemies you can walk in front of and they won't see or acknowledge you until you shoot them. More frustrating, however, is how tentative the AI becomes. At least two hours were added to my gameplay time simply because I was stuck waiting for the AI to show its face. There are quite a few moments where you must face down groups of snipers, but the snipers will actually hide from sight for four or five minutes at a time. All the while, I'm stuck waiting and waiting for an opportunity. There isn't a single level in the game where there isn't some enemy who hides from the fight for far too long.    I have an FPS pet peeve. I hate it when enemies can do certain basic physical maneuvers, but my character cannot. Enemies constantly roll out of the way or behind objects. Mace can crouch, but he can't crawl and he can't roll. Nor can he lean against walls or do anything even slightly Metal Gear. This makes no sense considering how the ground combat so often involves stealthy, sniper elements. If you're gonna have so much of that in the game, shouldn't you provide the gamer with the ability to do more than run and shoot?    Dead by design  Mace has moments where it's a lot of fun, but there are quite a number of stupid design issues. In just about every level, you kill lots of things in an asteroid mine, base, or prison, and then, with all enemies dead, you need to leave the asteroid. You have to get back to your ship, grab the controls, take off, then once you're out in the cold black of space, you need to boost to hyperspace to get to the next mission. Why the heck is my time being wasted when nothing's happening?    On the same token, you begin almost every level having to dock your ship with the mine, base, space cruiser, or prison you're entering. No enemies are attacking, you just have to pilot your ship to the hangar. Why? Why not have a cut-scene showing this and start me when I've landed? There's nothing, and I mean nothing, you can do other than land in the hangar. Terrible design. Simply terrible.   Don't throw that in here  Lastly, I have to point out my single biggest gripe. Grenades. An important staple of an FPS, grenades help to take out large groups of baddies and are just plain fun to throw. Mace Griffin: Bounty Hunter ruins all of that. The grenade physics are horrendous. Grenades bounce like superballs, I kid you not. It's almost impossible to toss a grenade towards an enemy and nail them, because the grenade shoots off every surface likes it's overcharged with caffeine. It's far too easy to throw a grenade into a room and have it bounce right back into your lap. As a consequence, grenades are useless for most of the game. A year's delay and no one said, ~Hey, what the f' is up with these grenades, man?~ Whatever those testers (and the developers) were smoking, send me some, I could use it for my glaucoma.   Graphics  Mace is, in general, a very attractive game. The real-time lighting on the weapons and the awesome weapon animations are among the best I've ever seen. Mace makes reloading a gun seem like an art form. But there are problems here too in terms of design. There aren't that many different creatures in the world and nothing distinguishes one from the other. You've seen one Jaldari (big apish creature), you've seen them all. It's hard to tell your allies from the baddies, and even though the environments change, it always feels like you're running through the same maze again and again.   The framerate has some occasional problems, but holds up well considering there are sometimes ten enemies on screens with loads of explosions coming from all directions. Mace himself looks like he came from Central Casting and a lot of the frightening mutations seen later in the game can be seen in numerous other games. It's like H.P. Lovecraft sneezed and Warthog grabbed the tissue and threw it in the game.   Sound  Former Black Flagg singer and current Spoken Word aficionado Henry Rollins provides the voice of Mace Griffin. He does a decent job, but most of the dialogue is a bit flat. Because the story isn't particularly involving, a lot of Rollins' words serve to fill time, rather than plot.    On the other hand, the score, though not as varied as I'd like, is solid. The music ramps up when enemies are around and it definitely adds an extra notch to the tension. The sound effects also score a thumbs-up. Whether it's bullets whizzing by or grenades offering up a thunderous explosion, the audio elements of Mace will drag most gamers in deeper. Like Halo, the enemies have plenty to say and a lot of it's pretty good. I just wish that innocents and NPC's would be more responsive when Mace stops in front of them. Having a cowering civilian with his hands up staring blankly into space isn't as much fun as having him beg for his life. Sometimes they talk, most of the time they're on mute.  Mace Griffin had a lot of promise. But none of those promises, aside from some really nice looking guns and lots of bloodshed, panned out. Going from ground combat to space combat in a seamless transition is a cool idea, but because of some limited creative design and occasionally lackluster execution, Mace's one advantage over other FPS' has gone to waste. Mace is fun at times (especially in the first few hours before the minor annoyances begin stacking up) and does a nice job of mixing up run and gun and sniper action, but the AI is buggy and sometimes the game absolutely drags. A year's delay for a game with no multiplayer, some clear game bugs, and an overall lack of polish? This is a rental for sure, because it isn't all that bad. Purchasing the game, probably isn't the best idea. Your 50 bones would be better served buying a few porn DVDs, finally making that student loan payment, or buying an extra copy of Halo so you can have one still in the wrapper.", "date": "Mar 17, 2004"}
