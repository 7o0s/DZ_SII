We've all played more than our fair share of crap Santa sleigh games or poor haunted house games timed to Halloween. But now Mobliss and Head First have chimed in with their Thanksgiving-themed title, Turkey Shoot. Is it worth gobblin' up? Or is this bird overcooked?  Features:  Turkeys Thanksgiving-themed entertainment Three types of game play   Turkey Shoot is a total cash-in, an attempt to make a quick buck off the holiday timing. Now, if the game had been something more than a hackneyed quilt of three poor mini-games based around assembling the ingredients for a Thanksgiving feast -- hunt the bird, get the veggies, etc. -- we might have been more forgiving. After all, hunting games are more than just a cottage industry on the PC -- and there's a reason. If you're not emotionally and spiritually opposed to hunting, you may find a certain level of engagement in a hunting game.  You will make no such connection with Turkey Shoot, and how could you? In the first mini-game, you just run around a farmyard and try to blast turkeys out of the air. Wait until the shadow of a flying turkey passes over you, and then unload some buckshot in its fanny. No, not to be anal, but aren't turkeys kinda known for being flightless birds?  Next, you have to russle up the veggies to accompany your turkey dinner. This part plays remarkably like Barnyard Bouncin', where you have to juggle pumpkins and other vegetables launched at you by your dog. When running back and forth, barnyard animals like cows and turkeys run past.  Finally, it's time to serve up the holiday feast. In a sequence that plays like Root Beer Tapper, you pick up cooked birds and pie from conveyor belts and deliver them to the open window at your house. Drop too much food, and it's game over.  Actually, it's 'game over' when you download Turkey Shoot because there is very little game here. There is no stand-out sequence in the rough collection of mini-games -- all are equally un-fun. The control is sluggish, and it doesn't help that the visuals are muted and muddy.  However, something can be said for the game's soundtrack. Not only does it feature a nice little theme song, but there are some good animal sound effects in the game.Turkey Shoot is actually kind of sad. I never like when I see developers put out substandard fare, because I honestly believe most programmers are capable of better. I like to imagine they're hamstrung by woeful budgets or evil marketing departments. However, whatever the reasoning for Turkey Shoot's lame game play and visuals, there's no excuse for foisting such crap upon the public, hoping to cash-in on the holiday season. This is as unappetizing as a mouthful of tofurkey.", "date": "Nov 26, 2003"}
