What do you say? ~This game is worth every dollar you didn't spend on it?~ ~Don't get this game and sit in a dark corner instead?~ What could be better than getting something for free? Luckily for us, the whole money angle doesn't really complicate reviewing Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time / Master Quest. The game, originally released for Nintendo 64 (with Master Quest planned but never released as a 64DD add-on disk) has aged so well, we'd recommend it even if you had to pay full price for it.Below, you will find our full review of the updated classic. Insiders can also watch and listen to Matt and Peer (and his daughter Romy) review the game here: 400x300 High-Res Video Review (41MB) 320x240 Low-Res Video Review (38MB)The Facts Two versions of the N64 classic on one disk Faithful port of Ocarina of Time Never before released Master Quest version features remixed dungeons and challenges Visuals upgraded to 640x480 resolution Dolby Pro-Logic sound Minimal load time only before initial start-up and when accessing the menus 480p (progressive scan) support Demo movies of upcoming Nintendo titles, like F-Zero, 1080, and Wario World.The GameThe gameplay in the GameCube version of Ocarina of Time is unchanged from the Nintendo 64 original. We won't go into detail here how great this game is (and we hold fast to the opinion that no N64 or GameCube game released since has been able to unseat it as our favorite adventure game out there), but rest assured that Ocarina of Time has stood the test of time and remains every bit as engaging as it once was. Apart from pioneering a new type of camera system back in 1998, Nintendo's masterpiece served up an exciting quest, an ~if you can see it, you can go there~ overworld, diverse and enjoyable dungeons, horseback riding, an interesting twist on the light world/dark world gameplay dynamic with a young and grown-up Link, an addictive fishing mini-game, and beautiful presentation all around. Yes, visuals and sound are outdated when you compare this emulated N64 game with other titles in the GameCube lineup, but the gameplay remains fresh and top notch to this date.But there's also no denying that more than four years have passed since this game came out, and in these four years, Nintendo and some other development companies have made technical advances and come up with tweaks and fixes to existing game mechanics. Take, for example, the fact that you cannot speed up or bypass certain conversations with NPCs, even if you've already had them numerous times before. After playing Wind Waker, it's also clear that the combination of a lock-on camera with a C-Stick controlled (Mario 64-style) camera is a more ideal solution than the rigid Z/L-trigger-only camera setup in Ocarina of Time. Oh, and the constant ~hey~ reminder from Navi can get annoying when you're taking time to explore the landscape. But these quibbles aside, Ocarina of Time is a fantastic title that will continue to be the yardstick that other adventure games will be compared to for years to come.Master QuestIf you've already finished Ocarina of Time, the main attraction on Nintendo's bonus disk is no doubt the never-released Ocarina of Time Master Quest. Known as Ura Zelda in Japan, Master Quest was originally slated to be released as a ~booster disk~ for the 64DD disk drive system. Even though the 64DD made it to market against all odds in limited numbers, the DD Zelda second quest was never made available to the public -- until now. Before we'll go into what's different in this alternate version of the game, let's clear up some misconceptions first. Master Quest is not the same game as Legend of Zelda DD. Originally, the game that would eventually become Ocarina of Time was planned as a 64DD-only game. The idea was to create a Zelda adventure that featured more persistent environments and more features that used the system's re-writable capabilities. As it became clear that the N64 wouldn't sell as well as expected in Japan, Nintendo redesigned Zelda DD for cartridge release. At the same time, it hatched plans for an add-on disk that would only be playable by owners of the cartridge adventure, Ocarina of Time. The idea for this second quest goes back to the very first Zelda game, Legend of Zelda for NES. After beating the game once, starting a new game with the name ~ZELDA~ would send gamers out on a second quest (for more details on the second quest, check out Snow Dragon's FAQ here.Even the smallest rooms in Master Quest now contain multiple challenges, some timed, some hidden -- but all of them quite tricky. Master Quest is the same way. It's not a different game from Ocarina of Time per se, but it's sufficiently altered to enthrall gamers, even if they've just finished playing through the original quest. The overall adventure is unchanged in Master Quest. You still wake up in Kokiri Forest, you still get Epona the same way, you still face the same bosses, characters, and events. But the moment you step into a dungeon, all bets are off. Each dungeon has been redesigned to offer new challenges -- and in turn, mess with returning players by remixing the puzzles and the room progression completely. While the actual dungeon layout and graphics remain the same, Master Quest often requires you to take completely different routes from the original. It assumes that you've finished the original quest and spends less time on teaching you the basics (you'll be happy to hear that the owl that appeared quite a lot in Ocarina of Time only does so very rarely in Master Quest). Likewise, more emphasis is placed on getting the Scarecrow's Song and finishing other sidequests (like finding the fairy wells) to perfectly complete dungeons. The outcome is a game that's far more difficult than the original Ocarina of Time, despite the unchanged difficulty levels during boss or monster fights.  Take, for example, the Fire Temple. The designers added flaming barriers in key places that prevent the player from accessing rooms that were readily available in the original quest. To get past these barriers, you'll have to use your hookshot and arrows in imaginative ways. There are also amusing new chain reactions that require you to set off a string of bombs that in turn triggers a switch or opens a passage. Other new challenges include invisible monsters that can only be seen when using the Lens of Truth -- even in the earlier dungeons -- and more Bombchu puzzles in the later ones. Every dungeon is changed, including the Ice Cavern, Ganon's Tower, the Bottom of the Well, and even Gerudo's Training Ground (but not the villages, the graveyard, or Gerudo Fortress). Additionally, all Skulltula spider locations are changed inside the dungeons (their locations in the overworld remain the same), presenting hardcore Zelda fans who can't stop playing until they have found everything more to do as well.On the flipside, some of the puzzles aren't as well-constructed as the original's (after all, ~second quest~ most likely meant ~second choice~ during the Nintendo design process). Thus, the Water Temple is a bit easier to complete now than before (although some of the puzzles have the potential to stump you if you don't pay close attention and properly survey the rooms when you enter) and the progression through the dungeons isn't always as smooth as in the original. Thus, the standard Ocarina of Time quest is still the better choice for first-time players. But if you've already finished the game before, Master Quest becomes a very entertaining and much more difficult nut to crack for returning players. It's amazing that Nintendo would be able to create an alternate version of an existing game with so many great, new puzzles while other companies still fill their adventure games with time-consuming fetch quests (ahem, Star Fox Adventures) and enough block puzzles to drive you crazy.The PortNow for the bad... As great as the two Zelda adventures on this disk are, the port to GameCube is rather lackluster when you think about what could have been. The graphics engine has been upgraded to run in 640x480 high resolution (which gets rid of the overly muddy look the N64 original displays when running on modern big-screen TVs) and it even supports 480p progressive scan mode for HD and DTVs, but other than that the visuals are unchanged. The biggest disappointment lies in the framerate department. The game appears to run at a framerate in the mid-20s, just like the original. It's steady -- some of the slowdown that happened in OoT's Water Temple is gone -- but given the low-poly characters and environments, a more able developer would have been able to get the game to run at a smooth 60 frames per second. On the audio side, the game presents itself in the same Pro-Logic (1) surround sound as the original. The music sounds dated by today's standards, but the great environmental sound and sound effects still manage to impress. Just stand still in the fields and listen to how much you can hear -- even when nothing is happening in the game.While the textures and models look dated, the game's wonderful visual presentation stood the test of time. Control-wise, it quickly becomes obvious that the game was designed for the N64 controller. The translation of the N64 analog stick to the GameCube's left stick left the first-person aiming a bit jumpy. You'll have a harder time lining up the sights when using the hookshot or bow and arrow than in the original, but you'll get used to it over time. Similarly, the N64's C-buttons were more intuitive than the GameCube's C-Stick, or the the X, Y, and Z buttons that can also be used. Finally, there is some slight stutter when accessing the ~Start~ menu as well as a strange bug that doesn't let you choose the option to stop playing after saving your game. On the other hand, the GameCube controller's rumble is more pronounced than what the N64's Rumble Pak could deliver, so put your Wave Bird away for some hours to find all the hidden secrets that the Stone of Agony alerts you to.The port is based on the second edition of Ocarina of Time for N64, which featured altered music in the Fire Temple (minus the Muslim chant included in the first batch of carts shipped out) and green blood during the final battle with Ganon.ExtrasThe disk also includes a new rendition of the Zelda theme at the start-up menu, some bonus movies of slick, upcoming Nintendo titles such as Wind Waker, and F-Zero, as well as some rather disappointing footage of 1080 and Wario World. A playable demo of Wind Waker or perhaps some history on the Zelda franchise would have been cooler bonus (or even the clips of the Capcom titles included on the Japanese release), but we're not complaining. It's great that Nintendo is finally stirring the drum and giving GameCube owners advance looks at upcoming projects. Kudos to NOA for offering the game in a proper DVD case, not the paper sleeve that the Japanese version shipped in.The release of Master Quest is a sweet, sweet surprise for any Zelda fan. After writing an article about cancelled Zelda games back in 2001, I didn't think Ura Zelda would ever see the light of day. Bundling it with a Wind Waker is a stroke of genius. Not only did it give gamers an incentive to preorder the game early, it also ensures that everyone who plays Wind Waker will now know the story of the predecessor. While it's most likely that Nintendo conceived the idea of offering the bonus disk because of negative feedback to Wind Waker's changed look, it ended up being one of the greatest bonus offers we've seen in a long time.Ocarina of Time has aged extremely well. The gameplay remains top notch and the added Master Quest is a fantastic reason to play the game again, even for those who have play through the original multiple times (as I have). Sure, an extended ending, bonus clip or altered final battle would have been nice, but the game is still so much fun, it really doesn't need anything extra to amaze you again. Graphically, the game looks dated when compared to the rest of the GameCube lineup -- something that could have been addressed with a more competent port -- but you'll get immersed into Ocarina of Time's rendition of Hyrule so quickly, you won't notice it later on in the game. It really is a testimony to the game's overall design that it can still wow players in the age of graphically-intense games like Star Fox Adventures or Metroid Prime.So, the final verdict then: points off for the lazy port -- but rest assured that Ocarina of Time has lost little of its luster, the Master Quest is a wonderful bonus for returning players, and the fact that the whole package is free makes this an essential addition to any GameCube owner's library. Don't delay any longer. Go find a store that has the bonus disk in stock and preorder the marvelous sequel, Wind Waker, and rest assured that you will own two er, three timeless classics that are textbook examples of pure gaming bliss.", "date": "Feb 27, 2003"}
