This action game isn't exactly the usual fare for the system  and that's a good thing. Just don't expect any cameos from the classic WB crew. Features  Nine levels Overhead perspective Password save For Game Boy or Game Boy Color    This is the devil's first solo outing on the Game Boy Color, and Sunsoft has put together a game that strays from the me-too style platformers. Instead,  Munching Madness offers a very RPG-style perspective in this action game: overhead. The maps are huge   in some cases painfully so. The whole idea is to traverse the land in search of five medallions, one of which only appears when you find and eat every piece of fruit on the island. Ah, but you have to watch out for the level enemies  these guys can be put out of commission by spinning (the classic Taz move) or spitting at them. When all five medallions are located, then it's onto the next level.  Some medallions are just hanging around certain parts of the level  just walk over to it and pick it up. Other medallions have to be earned. For example, you'll have to defeat a giant ape to snag one, and race your brother to the other side of the island to win another. It's these tasks that give the game a little more variety than those simple side-scrolling platformers.  But just to let you know , I was going to slam this game for one reason  finding all pieces of food on these huge levels was one big pain in the butt. Ah, but then I read the manual (silly me, eh?) Once I learned that Taz actually points in the direction of the next closest piece of food, the game clicked a lot better than it initially did. Now that I've got that in mind, the game works a lot better. There's still a lot of exploration that needs to be accomplished, and in this case the game gets a little on the tedious side. But thankfully after each medallion you're awarded a password to write down so you don't have to repeat certain tasks, and you can quit to give your eyes a break. After all, the graphics are really small, even for the dinky Game Boy Color screen. I'm not really a Tazmanian Devil fanatic (I'm a Wile E. Coyote nutcase through and through), but Munching Madness is a decently designed action game despite having that incomprehensible drooling beast in the lead role. Other than the slideshow intermissions , there's really nothing here that really requires the starring role to be Taz. But the game doesn't scream ~generic!~ like many licensed games, and Munching Madness is an enjoyable game that doesn't feel like every other platformer out for the Game Boy Color system.", "date": "Nov 10, 1999"}
