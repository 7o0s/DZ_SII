But in recent weeks, we've seen an explosion of games that attempt to be as in-depth as a console game or, saving that, a Game Boy title. The latest is Digital Bridges' Dungeon Storm, an isometric view adventure game that tries to inspire extended play sessions, not unlike JAMDAT's recent Neverwinter Nights. But can this sword-swinging dungeon crawl keep your attention?   Features:   Avoid traps  Battle multiple enemies  Multiple levels   Dungeon Storm will remind you of some of an early 90's RPG, when 3-D graphics were first introduced to the genre. The game is a paced crawl through multiple, similar-looking dungeon levels with a rough semblance of story to tie together endless strings of fights. If this was your bag in '94, or if you dug those King's Field PSone games, Dungeon Storm is your drug of choice. But for all others, there are some serious caveats before blowing $4.   The game moves at a very slow clip. Movement is just on this side of molasses, as moving your knight through the endless labyrinths sometimes takes absolutely fer-ever. What doesn't help matters is the game's control scheme. Kind of like a Resident Evil game, you push forward and back to walk, and left and right to rotate. There is no running around a corner or circling an enemy. There's coming to a dead stop and shuffling your feet ninety-degrees. Ugh. Not only does that make movement a pain, but it makes combat even worse.   Not that there is any shortage of nasties to slash in Dungeon Storm either. Enemy counts start low, with just a few bats to cut down, but soon you'll find yourself staring down multiple orcs and wizards in the mazes. And when these denizens creep around you, you're a sitting duck while you try to adjust your knight's perspective. There's no steeping right and left to stab at targets, it's only a single swipe attack at whatever is standing in front of you.   Dungeons are also full of traps, like spike-covered poles, spike pads, and bottomless pits. Most can be avoided, but in certain cases, you must use the jump button to leap to safety. Fortunately, this function is, well, functional. Considering that the view is isometric (never conducive to judging jumps) and the regular controls are so sluggish, we expected to fall in many a pit. But jumping is remarkably easy and accurate.   Dungeon Storm is a fairly quiet crawl. When you pick up keys (and there are a lot) and potions, you'll hear a little jingle. But there's no epic music to keep you feeling all swashbuckle-y. However, the game does look pretty decent. It's approximation of 3-D is admirable, and the enemy sprites are colorful enough that they stand out nicely from the gray dungeon.  As much as I appreciate what developer Mobile Gang was going for with Dungeon Storm, it's just hard to recommend. The pacing... is... just... so... slow. So much of the game is based on finding keys to open doors and combat that's difficult to control, and after two or three levels, it really ceases to amuse. However, if you are the kind of RPG fan that likes a good dungeon crawl -- emphasis on the ~crawl~ -- then you may find several hours of enjoyment out of Dungeon Storm. But that's only if Neverwinter Nights isn't available on your carrier to DL first.", "date": "Sep 14, 2004"}
