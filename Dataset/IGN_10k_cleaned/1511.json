Aside from the T-Rex running rampant through San Diego, the movie was pretty forgettable. If games based on movies are supposed to remain true to the original spirit, then DreamWorks has hit the nail on the head. The game is equally as forgettable.  The basic premise is a novel and promising one. Take a variety of dinosaurs and humans, animate them in life-like ways, and run them through cleverly disguised 2D platform levels. The fact that you get to play as dinos as well as humans is enough to get anyone excited, but don't get your panties in a bunch just yet, as it's not all it's cracked up to be.  Start the game as a compy and progress through velociraptors and finally to the big behemoth, the Tyrannosaurus Rex. The dino animations are top-notch, and it's a joy to just watch them run around. And hey, what  would a dinosaur game be without carnage? Thankfully, The Lost World has it in spades, with plenty of bone-crunching and back scraping. And screaming.  However, all this great screaming and blood is lost after you realize you can't control the game for beans. Platform titles require tight control and lightning-fast response, and The Lost World has neither. It's extremely tough to get just about anywhere effectively.  While presentation is excellent and the diversity in gameplay is commendable, DreamWorks can't hide the fact that The Lost World basically offers the same tired action that we have seen in far too many games before.  In the end, the gameplay and control make the action so monotonous that players miss what's good about the game.", "date": "Aug 26, 1997"}
