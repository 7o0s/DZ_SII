And after ~Van Helsing~ and ~Troy,~ let's hope the worst is past. (Did anybody else feel every single one of those 160 minutes in ~Troy?~ Make with the horse already!) But as goes the summer movie cycle, so goes the summer movie game tie-in cycle, and the first contender out of the gate is based on the Hugh Jackman-starrer, ~Van Helsing.~ Can Lavastorm Engineering -- a very talented development house -- spin gold out of, uh, straw?   Features:   Play as Van Helsing  Fight off Hyde, Vampire Brides, Wolf Man, and Dracula  Use knives and crossbows  Multiple stages   Well, Lavastorm certainly gave it the proverbial college try. This mobile game is, without a doubt, better than its source material -- a loud, CGI-filled popcorn movie that's as soulless as Dracula himself.   Van Helsing is a multi-stage, side-scrolling action game that will remind you in many way ways of Streets of Rage mixed with a little Altered Beast. Problem is, you'll wish you were playing those games instead. They were just as shallow, but they controlled a lot better, at least.   Moving is attached to your phone's touchpad while shooting is assigned to the number keys. Multiple number keys, that is. You must press different number keys depending on which direction you want to slash or shoot. For example, to shoot to the upper-left, you need to tap ~1.~ This system just isn't intuitive, at all. Hands aren't shrinking at the same rate phones are, so your bananahands will be all over the place on this one.   Fortunately, Van Helsing's targeting system is very forgiving. On the game's third level, you're riding atop a moving stagecoach as vampire brides divebomb to attack. If you manage to fire the crossbow into their quadrant of the screen at the right time, you'll usually score a hit. That certainly goes a long way to make up with the difficulty in precision shooting.    The game follows the story of the film. You begin fighting Hyde and conclude in a showdown with Dracula. You have five lives to send Drac back to hell, and a reasonably decent gamer should be able to manage this adventure in a couple tries. However, should you falter too much, try the game on ~easy~ mode (there are multiple difficulty settings), as you will discover a greater number of health and weapon power-ups.   Van Helsing looks fairly decent for a handset game. It's not Lavastorm's best effort to date, but we've seen far worse visuals on our phones before. The animation is unfortunately pretty limited. When Van is moving across the stagecoach, we were reminded of those old Nintendo Game & Watch doo-hickeys -- frame... by... frame. The soundtrack fares better. Sure it loops over and over, but it's a good loop.There's no way around it: Van Helsing just isn't that entertaining. The control scheme is going to put off a lot of casual players -- those players that weren't already put off by the awful movie. Kudos to Lavastorm for doing a good job following the film's ~plot,~ but it's just not an engaging thread. If you really enjoyed the movie, give it a try. Otherwise, you may be better off saving your downloading dollars for Lavastorm's next summer movie game, King Arthur.", "date": "May 21, 2004"}
