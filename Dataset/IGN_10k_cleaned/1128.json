{"name": "Pharaoh: Cleopatra", "name_review": "Pharaoh: Cleopatra", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/07/27/pharaoh-cleopatra", "text": "Everyone here at IGNPC loved Pharaoh (be sure to read our review if you haven't yet) so there was a pretty big fight over who was going to get to review Cleopatra, the new expansion pack for the game. Due to the fact that I'm really loud and bratty, I won the honors (watching a grown man cry day after day will wear anyone down). But after my first few days playing the game, I began to wonder whether my tantrum was such a good idea. While Cleopatra boasts all of the graphics and gameplay that made the original such a favorite, the new missions are so hard that I was very worried about meeting my deadline. While I ended up making it in the end, I quickly realized that this was not a title to be taken lightly.  Basically, Cleopatra picks up where Pharaoh left off and lets you take command of Egypt's dynastic line though four new campaigns. The first campaign, Valley of the Kings puts you in charge of building huge new tombs, carved into the faces of the cliffs that surround your city. Once you've got 'em built, you'll also have to work very hard to make sure that the local tomb robbers don't crack into them and steal all of the supplies for the journey into the underworld that you have stocked them with. Once you've made it through these beginning missions (and as the easiest of the lot, they're not all that easy), you'll be ready to move on to Ancient Conquerors, several missions pitting you against the worst of Egypt's enemies (the fight with the Hittites took me forever to beat). As if fighting off all these invaders wasn't bad enough, you'll also have to keep your cities stocked with all the niceties of an advanced civilization. Cleopatra doesn't cut you nearly as much slack as its predecessor did. The third campaign is Ramses in the Valley and comes complete with a set of missions that put you in the shoes of the great pharaoh. In many ways, this Campaign is a combination of the two that came before and will force you to exercise both your building and your fighting skills before you're done. Finally, the last campaign, Cleopatra's capital, will give you a chance to build all of the great monuments you've dreamed of, like the Lighthouse and Library at Alexandria. It also gives you a chance (whether you like it or not) to take on the Roman army. To be completely honest, I didn't fare so well against them, but I had a lovely time building huge cities for them to destroy.  So apart from the new missions, what else can you expect from Cleopatra? Well, in addition to the Romans, the Hittites and the Grave Robbers, you'll also come in contact with the Macedonians (and since the city is called Alexandria, you can guess which way that fight goes) and the Persians. Both of these two new foes offer a much greater challenge than anything the first game offered up and if you plan to win, you'll have to find a way to keep your recruiters working overtime without upsetting your populace. You'll also face new challenges in the form of plagues. I couldn't figure out why things kept going badly for me about the time the slave labor started following this mysterious new leader until I figured out that the leader in question was Moses. In addition to the hailstorm that I included in my screenshots (the hailstorm kills most of the walkers who make the mistake of wandering outside when it starts),I also came across swarms of frogs (which invade homes, leaving a little frog icon above them, and irritate those inside until you destroy their huts), locusts (not good for the crops) and even saw the Nile turn to blood (also not good for the crops). Since the missions are so challenging on their own, these disasters often become more than you can handle. Make sure you keep a lot of extra food and goods locked away in case of trouble. Finally, you can now go back and play any of the missions in the game in any order, so if you got stuck the last time around, you can see what you missed.  While there are quite a few things that set Cleopatra apart from Pharaoh, there's an awful lot that the add-on pack doesn't change. The game ships without any manual at all, quite a disappointment after the lovely textbook included in the original title. The soundtrack is also the same, and while there's no doubt that I loved it the first time around, I've heard it so many times now that I'm humming it in my sleep. Finally, while the new monuments and structures available to you have been drawn with all of the care that the first game exhibited, things look pretty much exactly like they did the first time around.  I did have a few problems with the new industries included in Cleopatra. In order to dig a tomb out of a cliff, you must employ Artists who require both paint to work on the walls with and lamps to light their way inside the darkened halls. I had no trouble creating lamps (out of oil and pottery) and paint (out of henna), but no one ever seemed willing to take these goods to the tombs themselves. I checked every possible problem and, while my city was functioning properly, no one seemed interested in delivering the goods to the tombs. The next few times I played through similar scenarios, I found the same problem popping up sporadically. Sometimes everything would work fine and other times, with all of the building in the same place, the goods wouldn't get delivered. While this problem wasn't exactly earth-shattering, it was pretty annoying.  In the end, I enjoyed my time with Cleopatra, but if I had to describe it in one word, that word would be difficult. While those who waltzed through the first game will certainly appreciate the new additions and challenge, this pack may be a little intimidating to those who are new to the series or who had a little trouble the first time around. Fortunately, the fact that you can skip past missions that are giving you trouble makes all of this a little easier to swallow.  -- Trent C. WardComment on this story", "date": "Jul 27, 2000"}
