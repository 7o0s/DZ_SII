After all, if the kids participating are young, they probably don't know what a good game is. As long as the main character looks like the doll or character it's supposed to be, who cares about everything else right? That seems to be the thinking behind Strawberry Shortcake - the Sweet Dreams Game. Tired platforming action gets taken out again for another round and it's not even done that well.   Odds are that you're a parent looking to find out just what this game has to offer. It has six characters from the Strawberry Shortcake world and a side-scrolling environment for them to explore. There are lots of jumps to make, tons of seeds to collect, and more items to collect. There is some danger in the form of enemy animals and spiky bushes, but the penalty for hitting them is minor and dying isn't easy.    Unfortunately, getting frustrated with this game is easy to do. For a game that has such a strong emphasis on jumping, it's easy to get hung up on edges or knocked off of objects. One of the main tricks here is creating a plant that can be jumped on to reach a higher area. Growing it is easy enough, but jumping on the leaves can easily become a hassle. Similar problems pop up for some similar obstacles in the game. If your kids are used to some abstract challenges, this might be good. Or it could be fuel for a tantrum. Who knows?   What The Sweet Dreams Game does well is it creates a colorful, bright, and pink world that is fitting for the characters. Everything is practically shimmering with color and for the most part the action is smooth. It's decently done from a child's perspective, but to say anything beyond that would be stretching. The levels are relatively straightforward and the challenges are pretty cleanly laid out. A couple of places could use some parental help, but it's not too bad.   Some of Strawberry Shortcake's challenges assume that kids would have some familiarity with other platformers, and it would be better for them if they try out Spyro, LEGO Star Wars, or some like-minded game first. After that, they should be fine on their own (but honestly, either one of the previous choices would be better ones).   Aside from the blandness of the action, another issue with the gameplay is that the levels are uneven in how they're divided. One level may be finished in a couple of minutes while another requires moving around a much larger space and finishing more goals in order to save. It would've been better if save points were more spread out so that kids wouldn't have to tackle too much at once.   To break up the platforming there are a couple of flying sections too. They're a good distraction, but it can be hard to see where the ships are flying. This can make it easy to hit objects in the way. Kids might appreciate how the challenges don't get much harder, but be frustrated by trying to see what's going on.Strawberry Shortcake - The Sweet Dreams Game is a standard and uninspired licensed title with some quickly thrown-together platforming action. If your children have played similar games before and love the characters, then this will be a good pickup for them. That doesn't mean that this is a good game, just good enough for the audience it's targeted for.", "date": "Nov 14, 2006"}
