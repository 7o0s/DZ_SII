There's two very good reasons for this  first, the game is ridiculously long, with all adventures and quests taking up a full five CD-ROMs (according to Black Isle, if you knew exactly where everything is the game will take you about 150 hours to finish. Second, and perhaps more important to this review, the game is amazingly fun. I must confess that I uttered the phrase, ~I just need to play a few more days to finish up,~ to Jason and Tal a bit more than was absolutely necessary. The surprising thing is, while it definitely took quite a bit of my time to fully understand the game, it won't take much time at all to explain how the folks at BioWare crafted a game that's so damn addictive.  The main task that BioWare took on was to recreate, as closely as possible on the computer, the feeling of playing Dungeons and Dragons. As if that wasn't hard enough, they were faced with a predecessor (SSI) who had already done a great job in an earlier series. BioWare added to their own troubles when they decided to make the game real-time and multiplayer. Many of us in side the industry thought we were again seeing the all too familiar face of a young development team biting off more they could chew. Boy, were we wrong.  Baldur's Gate is, simply put, the best computer representation of Dungeons and Dragons ever made. It includes every set of rules that even the most rabid fan could hope for while staying focused enough to appeal to those who have never played the pen-and-paper game before. The entire game is played exactly like a true game of AD&D with savings throws, armor classes and to-hit rolls and combat range and speed all computed with every scrap the party gets into. The thing that makes this all so impressive (and very different from SSI's Gold Box series) is that it all goes on behind the scenes where it belongs. Every class, every race, every spell and every item has been thoroughly thought out and presented in a way that can fill even an RPG veteran with a renewed sense of wonder but is done seamlessly enough that a non-role-player would never suspect that there was an entire world of rules going on behind his character's every move.  Even with the best engine in the world though, Baldur's Gate couldn't have gotten far without a terrific storyline. I mean, how do you go about writing a tale that can be achieved by (while still providing challenge for) 16 different character classes (more if you count multi-classes) who could be of any race or alignment? BioWare handled it by starting your character as the ward of a powerful mage, Gorion, who has been your protector for as long as you can remember. As the game begins, you are told by members of your community (a safe haven named Candlekeep) that Gorion is looking for you. Once you find him (which can involve several sub-adventures in and of itself) he warns you that you are no longer safe in the citadel which has served as your home for so long. Without a warning, he takes you out into the night in order to secret you off to another, safer, location. Unfortunately, whatever the danger is finds you on your way out and the only father you have ever know is struck down before your eyes. Running from the scene (and his assailant) you find yourself alone in a vast land (AD&D's Sword Coast) with no one to aid you or warn you of trouble.  Fortunately, that's a situation that is soon remedied. Baldur's Gate lets you carry five other adventurers along with you on your journeys. You'll find these travelling companions while travelling, in bars, or after completing a quest that makes them accessible to you. While you don't get to create these characters yourself (you don't get to create them in a real roleplaying game either) you will control their actions as you progress through the game. More than just cardboard cutouts, these player characters have their own feelings, psychoses and agendas which may or may not match up with your own. The most important advice I can offer a new player is to pick your companions carefully  it's no fun to be in a tough fight and find that the man who was just guarding your back is now stabbing at it.  A lot of what will determine how well you're able to get along with your comrades is what kind of character you have created. All of the major options from the AD&D rules are included (including mage specialists) and the creation process itself is both easy and entertaining. The one beef I did have here is that it would have been nice for BioWare to provide you a way to print your character sheets for use with the pen-and-paper game. In addition to all of the standard options, you also get to choose from a list of pre-rendered character portraits and voices or create your own and dump it into the game. Just be sure that if you decide to make your own voice recordings you make them entertaining  I managed to annoy the crap out of myself in a few minutes flat with mine.  Although good looks weren't absolutely necessary for Baldur's Gate to be a good RPG, the fact that they're there is a welcome surprise. All of the overhead maps, all of the character screens, and most importantly, the interface itself are amazingly well crafted while at the same time adept at pulling you deeper into the game world. Spell effects are partcularly magnificent, from the glowing blaze of a magic missile spell to the writhing tendrils of an entangle spell and boast different and powerful sound effects to go with them as well. Little artistic details are also evident in every aspect of the title from glowing red frames that show up when a thief detects a trap and the darkening of the sky at sunset to the way an enemy explodes when damaged far beyond his hit-point total or catches on fire when hit by flames. Nothing was spared in making the presentation of this game as entertaining as any other portion of it.  So what about the game itself? In many ways the engine is similar to that of Diablo. You select a party leader and a formation type and just click wherever you want the group to go. The big difference is that you can stop the action in Baldur's Gate at anytime. Whenever you run into trouble all you have to do is mash down the space bar to pause the game. Once paused, you can tell each of your characters what you want them to do in the combat and take all the time in the world to do it. Once you're ready to go, you click the space bar again and the real-time resumes. Once paused, all of the option screens (spellbooks, character profiles, etc.) are available to you with one exception  if you ever access the inventory screen, the world outside reverts back to real-time. This is actually a very good way to make the danger of switching weapons in combat more real.  In fact, all of the sub-screens in the game are equally well though out. The inventory screen uses a standard 'paper doll' system to represent the items that your character is currently using. Each character also has a certain number of quick weapons and or items that they can access quickly (without bringing up the inventory screen) in times of need. Objects resting in a character's backpack are shaded out in red if unusable by that particular player and the weight of each object is totaled in a small icon that shows how much the character can carry without penalty and how much they are currently carrying. Standard AD&D encumbrance rules apply and a slowed character will quickly get separated from your party because of his or her slow movement. The spell book is equally thorough, each spell that a character has learned or is capable of learning having its own icon. To memorize a spell, all a player needs to do is click it over to his active box and then go to sleep long enough to store it in memory. The character information boxes not only show a character's standard stats but also a brief background for them, a detailed listing of all their special abilities and savings throws as well as there current experience and how much experience they need for their next level. There's also a journal screen that will keep notes on every conversation you and every adventure you undertake so that in order to figure out who you were supposed to return that potion to all you have to do is left click and read back a bit. Finally, there's a quick and easy automap that let's you look at any ground you've already uncovered (although there's no guarantees as to what may be standing on that ground if your character's can't see it directly). All of these sub-screens allow you to get all of the information you need quickly and easily without having to consult the instruction manual.  As if all of this wasn't great enough news for the hardcore RPG fan, Baldur's Gate also has a great multi-player option that makes it easy and rewarding to journey with friends. Tal and I found multiplayer to be much like the single player mode with just a few exceptions. First off, since you aren't picking up loads of NPCs (at least when you're playing with six people you're not picking up any NPCs) you tend to miss out on many of the subquests that fill out the story of the game. There's nothing that keeps you from doing them, it's just that you may not know where they actually take place. Second, the multiplayer game, as you might imagine, didn't seem to be as stable as the single player mode. We experienced several crashes and lock-ups, but not so frequently as to be all that irritating (actually they forced us to take a look at our surroundings every now and then). Finally, and this is key, the multiplayer game is only as much fun as the people you play with. As with a real game of AD&D, it only takes a couple of guys more interested in smacking each other around than adventuring to ruin a game. I'm not talking about anyone specifically here, but I hope that Aaron and Desslock will kiss and make up before the next session  Although you shouldn't have too many problems, we did find a few bugs here and there in the single player game as well. Occasionally we would run into scenarios where certain NPCs wouldn't recognize that we were holding certai items they were asking for, or wouldn't remember having spoken with us before. This only happened a couple of times and often wasn't repeating  when we reloaded our game everything worked out fine. We also ran into a couple of full out crash bugs, but in all fairness, I only had this happen twice in over four days of nearly continual play.  In the end, Baldur's Gate is the best thing to happen to computer role-playing games in a very long time. Not only has the game shown that you can build a statistics heavy game without making it boring or confusing, but it has shown that it's possible to build them with style and beauty. I recommend this game for anyone who enjoys fantasy, role-playing or adventure games. BioWare has not only done justice to the AD&D license, they've set the standard for what role-playing games should be.  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Jan 19, 1999"}
