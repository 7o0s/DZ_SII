Lacking a license and without the slick gameplay of EA's FIFA offerings (or ISS games on other platforms), the game was an enigma. Why bring out a soccer title a month before you release another licensed game... especially when it is a very similar product? You got me. But that's what Konami decided to do.   Now, we are faced with ESPN MLS Gamenight, the second part of the Konami tandem. The same problems that plagued ISS Pro Evolution are still there. After all, it is virtually the same game. However, this time the players have names you can recognize, the MLS franchise is real, and the game just feels a little different. Is it the best soccer title on the system? Definitely not. Is it better than its Pro Evolution counterpart? Yes.   Is it that the good folks at Konami had more time to tweak this game? Apparently so. Player models look a little better, the action is more fluid and the AI seems improved. But it's the intangibles that make this one more enjoyable. In Pro Evolution, player names were fudged to approximate their international counterparts. This is what happens when you don't have the rights to such things. In Gamenight, there's something much more fulfilling about turning away a shot with Tony Meola, as opposed to an imaginary player named Tony Miata.   You might remember that I scorched the original release of ISS Pro Evolution to the tune of 5.1. Why? Partially because I expect a lot out of soccer titles. I have been playing the game all of my life: in youth leagues, high school and through college, both outdoor and indoor. I still play today. If you fly to San Francisco, I'll be more than happy to take you on in a game of footy, either outdoors or on the living room couch, twisted-cord style. My love for the sport makes me impassioned about the video games related to it. ISS fell short of my expectations, and I slammed it. It was a moment of passion, and the game deserves another look. I stand by the fact that the lack of license made Pro Evolution weak, and that the commentary and repeat play (in the face of another title on the way) left something to be desired.   Gameplay On the other hand, I was a bit hard on gameplay in the Pro Evolution review. This game sports the same engine and control scheme.  In both titles, the controls have a slow but steady learning curve, but once you master them, they're solid and responsive. My standing complaint in the area of controls is that too much is relegated to the shoulder buttons. While it seems natural to hold down the R1 button to sprint, using L1 to change players took a lot of getting used to. But that's just me.   Changing players is still a point of controversy. Unless you are diligent about switching your players, the computer will do it for you, and often at the worst time. This can be quite unnerving on defense when you're trying to switch from a closer player to the defender who has a better angle on the ball. The computer's player selection is uneven, and may leave you in an awkward situation.   One other gripe that wasn't addressed in this version was the lack of control during set plays. While you are able to choose between several different sets on each given dead ball, there is no way to tell where the ball is going to go. Instead of an arrow (which is standard in all other soccer sims out there) to show where the ball is headed, Gamenight only permits you to point in a specific direction and let the chips fall where they may. Without some kind of meter or arrow, the best you can do is put the ball in a general direction. While this cuts down on an opponent knowing what you're going to do, it hinders you more than it helps.   Luckily, the smoothness of gameplay seems to have improved. Pro Evolution felt a bit plodding at times. It's not that the players move faster here, they just move better. The gameplay isn't halted as much by an overpowering defense or an unrealistic number of goals. In fact, the flow of the game is more fluid and the AI is, at times, very good. While in PE defenders and goaltenders were easy to smoke, the players in Gamenight hold the line much better, no matter what the difficulty is set to. On offense, players make appropriate runs and crash the posts when you expect them to. There are no wonky goals here, unless you maneuver your players way out of position.   There are several game modes available in Gamenight, and the best of these is to play through the actual 2000 MLS season. In addition to MLS play, there is the International Cup, Konami Cup, European Cup, African Cup, American Cup and Asian Cup. If you need some practice (which is a great help in getting used to the controls) there is an extensive training mode here as well.   All of the MLS teams are represented here, as well as several national squads, which have been plucked directly out of PE. While I'm happy the choices are there, the heart and soul of this game is taking a Major League Soccer team to the MLS Cup. After all, who knows how long a soccer league will hold on here? There may not be many exclusively MLS games in the coming years. Get 'em while they're hot!   Graphics The graphics in Pro Evolution were strong and they continue here. The player models are virtually the same, although the animation sequences in Gamenight seem a bit smoother. Overall, this is one of the better looking soccer titles on the market. The reason? The realism in the animations.   The trapping and tackling animations are especially cool. If you charge a player and denude him of the ball, your player will sometimes stumble a bit as he claims the ball. On a breakaway, the player will kick the ball far in front of him as he strides to the goal. If a ball is headed over the end line, a foot trap won't cut it. If your player tries to pull a ball down like this, it will dribble off his foot over the end line. The delicacy in capturing these motions is quite good, and lends a lot to the realism of the game.   Player models are pretty crisp as well. Although there is not a lot of differentiation in face type, you can definitely tell when you're up against Carlos Valderrama (the game's cover boy), Marco Etcheverry or Roy Lassiter from their posture and body type (and of course, hair).   Sound Another area where this game shines over Pro Evolution is in the sound category. While the on-field sounds and crowd noise are rather standard, the play by play commentary has picked up significantly. Undoubtedly this is due to ESPN's stake in the game. Perennial soccer voice Bob Ley lends his voice to the game to good effect.   If you want a Spanish announcer, tune in to the vocal stylings of Luis Tapia. This adds a great dimension to the game. Once I tuned in once to Luis, I never went back. It is just too rewarding to hear him yell ~Goooooooaaaaal!~ when you score. In addition, Tapia is likelier to chat during the whole match, lending even more realism to the game.Overall, Gamenight improves on Konami's Pro Evolution title in most of the problem areas, making it a solid soccer sim for the PSX. The MLS license, coupled with the support of ESPN lend credibility and depth to the game. The added commentary and improved AI but hurt, either. The real question is, do you want to play a more simulation-style game (like this) or do you want to wait for a more arcade-style FIFA at the end of the month. In the end, it boils down to preference.", "date": "Oct 18, 2000"}
