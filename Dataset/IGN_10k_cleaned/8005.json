At the time of its release it was one of the premiere other-worldly racers out there, competing with the likes of Nintendo's Wave Race 64 and Psygnosis' WipEout series, and it stood up extremely well when held next to its competitors.   The game is mix of land and sea racing, with most taking place over water. It has a number of catches that distinguish it from other similar games, namely the large racing field and use of a grappling beam in order to take corners more tightly. While these are certainly neat features, it's the game's tight controls and overall polished design that makes it a worthy experience even more than 10 years after its initial release.    Using the grappling beam, you're able to latch onto metallic objects, most commonly the beams that mark each checkpoint, and pull yourself towards them. When you're taking a turn, this helps you whip around the corner much quicker and tighter, though if you don't release the grapple in time you'll wind up crushing yourself into the bar and using a bit of time.   Along with this mechanic, you also have the ability to lean into turns and lean forward and back as you go over jumps and waves. As well, each lap you complete refits you with four new turbo boost uses. While navigating the tracks properly is important for a clean racing line, using each of these abilities is important for cutting seconds off each lap, providing for a fair bit of mastery over the game's racing controls.   One concept that you'll learn very early on is that the tracks are designed to really test your racing abilities. The first course is pretty wide open and breaks up a number of concepts into smaller sections, like waves or odd geometry to race over, but after that your skills will be tested over and over again. Turns come quick and fast, keeping you very hesitant to hit your boost. Water-filled woods are a common occurrence and remind us of the speeder bike scene from Return of the Jedi. In short, Jet Moto is a tough, tough game, and one that you'll have to work at to finish atop of the leaderboard.    The PSP emulation of Jet Moto works out rather nicely as the game's R2 and L2 controls aren't absolutely necessary. These lean you into a turn a bit farther than the R1 and L1 buttons, but if you find them necessary you can just map them to the L and R buttons and use them exclusively rather than the shorter leans. Additionally, the game's quick race times and ability to save after each race work really well on the portable system. The only loss here is the ability to play a split-screen game against a buddy, which is true of all PSone games on the PSP, but the single-player portion is engaging enough to make you forget about it.Jet Moto is still a pretty fun experience more than 10 years after its original release. It's tough, fast and, most importantly, fun. Pick this one up if you want a fun racer and don't mind decade-old visuals.", "date": "Feb 5, 2007"}
