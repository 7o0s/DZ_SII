The company at least had the forethought that it would be, so it put its Gameloft studio on a Nintendo DS rendition of the franchise. Gameloft is, admittedly, a hit-or-miss development team, but when it squeezes out a hit on the DS system it's a pretty noteworthy one: last year's Brothers in Arms DS turned out an impressive handheld rendition that worked the system's strengths and weaknesses into a fun and intense action game. We may never know for sure if the same internal group handled Assassin's Creed: Altair's Chronicles on the Nintendo DS, but it seems to share a lot of the same similarities as the Brothers in Arms conversion. This game, however, isn't quite as polished as it could (or should) have been.   The Nintendo DS rendition of Assassin's Creed isn't a port or a sequel of the 2007 Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 game. It's a prequel, utilizing the same lead character and his acrobatic, assassin abilities. Strike one against the DS game: while it's a standalone experience, Altair's Chronicles lacks the same character development of the console game. In this version, you're a secretive Crusade badass -- and that's pretty much all you need to know. It's a small knock against the game because Assassin's Creed on the DS puts a lot more emphasis on the action than the storyline compared to last year's bigger production.   So in this portable rendition, you're sent on a task to recover a Chalice that could end the Crusades once and for all. Of course, you're an assassin, and it's no fun just going up and taking it  you'll have to climb over cities via rooftops and try to sneak through guard-heavy areas undetected. Or better yet, just take on those guards head-on using your earned swordsmanship. Each mission unfolds just a little bit more of the storyline on your quest for the coveted cup. Players have the ability to climb up walls and along ledges, slide down sloping rooftops and balance over small pillars and planks of wood. When level designers string all of these elements together the game feels a lot like an extended version of Prince of Persia, another Ubisoft property.    Wonky in places, but Assassin's Creed on the DS is a perfect example of    If you're coming off the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of Assassin's Creed, now is the time to bring down the expectations: the Nintendo DS version is not an ~explore everywhere, do anything~ type of game like last year's release. Instead, the developers created a much more structured experience, forcing players along a much stricter path that requires far more ~go from point A to B~ elements. So less open-world Grand Theft Assassin, more Prince of Persia for the portable gamers.     Honestly, that's not a bad thing at all. What Gameloft has created for Assassin's Creed on the Nintendo DS is a pretty fun extension of Prince of Persia. While the camera rarely pops off its side-scrolling tracks, the environments are all in 3D which allows the designers to build some pretty elaborate levels and puzzles. The framerate is in that sketchy ~just below 30 frames per second~ area that Brothers in Arms DS seemed to sit: playable, but noticeably jumpy especially when playing side-by side with other adventure games like Phantom Hourglass. The tech created for Assassin's Creed DS enables the level designers to build detailed cities with destructible structures  many times you'll have to deal with rooftops collapsing or beams snapping in half while you're making your way across them. The game's chock full of scripted events triggered by wandering over specific hotspots or performing a specific task. Most of this stuff's standard fare for console and PC gaming but on the Nintendo DS the Assassin's Creed team's pulling off some impressive elements.   But then again, there are a lot of sloppy things about this game too. The first knock on the game  aside from the basic cutscenes and simple character development  is the game's somewhat weak combat system. You earn the ability to swing around a sword almost right from the start, and the designers definitely put a bit of effort into giving players a good amount of control here. X and Y are quick and strong attacks respectively, and combining that with the shoulder button to block and you can counter attacks for some one hit kills. Unfortunately, there's a severe lack of focus here: apart from some occasionally resilient guards, you're never really encouraged to kill people using anything but button mashing X for a three hit combo or Y for a two hit combo. Assassin's Creed DS has a reward system in the form of collectible blue orbs that can be exchanged for upgrades, but the game never offers better awards for styled or stealth kills. Button mashing is easier, faster, and gains the same pick-ups after a defeated guard.   The combat system's the biggie. And the touch screen mini-games  little rhythm and drag-and-drop challenges -- aren't much to write home about. The rest of the issues are little nitpicks that all add up to a game that didn't quite get the necessary polish before release. Things like awkward collision where your character will try to climb up the wall next to a ladder instead of just grabbing the ladder. An incredibly wonky save system where you can (and will) lose your progress if you choose the wrong menu option.  Checkpoints that don't actually remember your position after a death. Puzzle challenges that can be exploited and bypassed in areas that the designers never intended you to go.  And there's one area in a town that respawns guards infinitely, which makes it easy to upgrade your character early in the game if you have the patience to fight hundreds of guards in a single shot.     And then there's the game's length. It's not very long and by the time you earn all the cool Assassin abilities, there aren't a whole lot of opportunities to use them. The lack of the ~open world~ design of the console game works against the DS game here since there's very little in the way of replay value.Even with the issues, I had a good time playing through Assassin's Creed multiple times. I say multiple times because, yes, that single save file can wreak havoc on your game's progress if you decide to jump around the stages using the level select feature. Altair's Chronicles definitely needed a couple more weeks of polishing up before Ubisoft's publishing date, but as a finished product it's a fun game for as long as it lasts.", "date": "Feb 6, 2008"}
