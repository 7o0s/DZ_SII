Ballooning in number over the last couple of years, it seems that no matter where you turn a super-deformed version of the South's favorite sport is being paraded around like runway models. Giant yellow birds, fat Italian plumbers, and even the cast of Mega Man have been pimped up into munchkins and stuffed into tiny little scooters. Following the trend ever so dutifully and not so long after a PlayStation release, Disney and Crystal Dynamics have decided to bring their own flavor to the Dreamcast with Magical Racing Tour.  The idea for such a game may have a few of you excited at the possibilities, as you too can race as your favorite Disney personality! Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto, and Goofy are all primed and ready for... eh? What's this? None of those guys are in there? Oh okay then, I guess we're going with the second tier characters as families everywhere can experience the intense race with stars such as The Beast, Aladdin, and Scrooge Mc... wait a minute... they're not in there either? Well then who in Hades is left? Tiara Dmage and Bruno Biggs? What the? Oh well, at least we get Chip n' Dale.  In fact, the story behind Magical Racing Tour centers around the exploits of the bumbling chipmunk duo. Once again not only have they gotten themselves into trouble by breaking Disney World's magic fireworks machine, but they've also been given the task to find the scattered pieces and reassemble them before tonight's pyrotechnics show. What better way is there I ask, than to find the missing elements of a firework machine, than by doing through it racing? Yeah I know, I know.  Odd as the setting is, the story actually provides an admirable backdrop to accomplishing each race's goals. As every single piece of the broken firework machine has been evenly divided amongst the amusement park's biggest rides, you'll have every excuse in the book to fully explore the levels to find the goodies. Not only do you have to finish first in a race to gain access to the missing piece, but you must also hunt down bonus items (like trophies and bright blue energy balls) in order to unlock a couple of well guarded secrets as well. All in all, the method behind the madness is a sound one, and children should enjoy the extra plot and item hunting quite a bit.  They should also dig the pretty graphics. Simple and faithful to it's source material the, every scene is brighter than the sun and filled with more colors than a Skittles commercial. If you ever wondered what those old 1960's Disney toons would have looked like if they were in 3D, this is your answer. My personal favorite visual touch has to be that opening video of Jiminy Cricket. On par with any scene from the Toy Story movies, our little insect pal looks terrific.  The most outstanding aspect of Magical Racing Tour has to be the levels themselves. Absolutely gigantic recreations of the biggest and best rides that Disney World has to offer, the attention to detail and activity is commendable. Whether it be Space Mountain that you're zooming through or the dangerously intense Haunted Mansion that keeps you coming back, the environments look just like their real life inspirations. Liberal exaggeration of each rides features and themes have almost made them more wondrous than the attractions themselves, and it'll be hard for anyone to not want to check them out more than once.  The levels are open-ended, meaning you can go back to any of them any time you so choose. Of course you have to beat the first couple of areas in a semi-linear fashion to do so first, but once all of them have been completed you can go back and search for what you missed. Similar in fashion to quest oriented games like Toy Story 2 and Symphony of the Night a percentage of your progress will be monitored at all times. The higher your percentage, the better rewards you receive for finishing the game.  Music too is worth a mention. Ripped directly from the soundtracks in Disney Studios, the score is clear, authentic, and most definitely happening. Played from beginning to end in their entirety classic tunes such as Happy Haunts, Jingle Bells, and the Pirates of the Caribbean have all been paired with their appropriate stage. By the sounds of things, the Dreamcast music is a big improvement over the PlayStation version's more garbled fare.  Even the control has a habit of growing on you. A hybrid of CTR and Mario Kart, the simple high-speed vehicles move along briskly without too much trouble on your fingers. Pulling off short little jumps and edging your way past the corners is easy as pie, and caters itself to fans of analog or digital movement, as you can use either. And although your vehicle changes depending what stage you're on (boats for the Pirates of the Caribbean, rocket ships for Space Mountain, etc.) the control schemes themselves don't change a lick. Nice touch.  My only question for Crystal Dynamics is that if they did such a good job with covering all their bases, why they chose to add what I deem to be a most curious flaw; the difficulty. Obviously aimed at children and hard-core Disney fans, you'd have to wonder why the challenge level is so danged nasty. From the Tomorrow Land Speedway and beyond, your opponents become ruthless, sadistic bastions of road hell and do everything in their power to knock you off course. Now I've been playing video games of all genres for decades, and while I'm certainly not the best racer in the world I do know how to hold my own. And after quite a few run throughs, figuring out the key to finishing in the top five became clear. But what about little Jimmy Jimmendorf? I can only imagine what kind of an experience that gamers aged 10 and under would have when thrown against the perils of the Haunted Mansion. The real bummer is that there isn't any sort of difficulty setting, so toning it down (or hyping it up for people who like to punish themselves) simply isn't possible.  Assuredly a title for kids with a lot of patience, Magical Tour Racing is a simple yet challenging romp into kart zooming for Dreamcast fans. While there's nothing here that's been done overly bad, there isn't anything particularly compelling about it either. With a hefty number of stages and characters (three of which you've heard of), and a straightforward system of racing-exploration, the game isn't that shabby. Colorful, musical, and true to the Disney spirit, MTR will keep the little ones happy as clams for a weekend or two.  -- Jeremy Dunham, IGNDC", "date": "Aug 3, 2000"}
