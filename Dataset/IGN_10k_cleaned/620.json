{"name": "Godzilla Generations Maximum Impact", "name_review": "Godzilla Generations Maximum Impact (Import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/01/11/godzilla-generations-maximum-impact-import", "text": "When the Dreamcast was originally released back on November 27th, 1998 one of the launch titles was the horrendous Godzilla Generations. Not only did the game pale in comparison to what the Dreamcast could do graphically, but it also was just a flat out boring game to play.  Now, a year later, the big green lizard returns to the Dreamcast. This time, the game is a very generic rail shooter along the same lines as Panzer Dragoon. Although the game never even comes close to the greatness of that classic, it is still a slightly more enjoyable romp through the Goldzilla license than the original.  One of the areas where the original game flopped was in the graphics department. The game was clear, and in high resolution, as you would expect from a Dreamcast title, but the characters and environments were very sparsely detailed.  Thankfully, the graphics have been improved for the most part. While the environments are still sparse, and there is some bad fogging and draw-in, the character models are fantastic. Godzilla himself is very detailed matching the newer monster suit nearly perfectly.  The skin textures are nicely detailed and reproduce the bumpy dinosaur look well.  On top of the great Godzilla and monster graphics, everything movies exactly how you'd expect having watched the movies. Godzilla has a slightly longer stride than the original suit, but everything else brings back fond memories of Godzilla vs. (insert monster name here). The flying monsters, such as Mothra, move as if they were hanging by wires, and the little helicopters, jets, and tanks look like small toys.  Unlike the mixed graphics bag, Godzilla excels in the sound department, with some great sound effects and music which both fit the game perfectly. The monster sounds for Godzilla and the various monsters are dead-on.  When Godzilla roars, you instantly recognize the sound from the classic films.  If that wasn't enough, the music is classic Godzilla fare. This is big music for a big beast stomping Tokyo into rubble. What more could you ask for?  Unfortunately, after you get past the graphics and sound, this Godzilla game falls apart. The game is an ~on rails~ shooter along the lines of Panzer Dragoon or Star Fox. You're basically dragged along a pre-determined path shooting at things as they come at you.  The problem here is that you have very little control when it comes to dodging. You can veer to the left or right, but Godzilla moves so slowly that you'll be taking a lot of hits unless you shoot everything before it gets near you.  That brings up the next problem.  The game has a ~lock on~ feature, but it doesn't work as it should. When you hold down the fire button, and move your cursor over your target, it will be selected as if it was locked on. But, the game is designed so that you still must aim your laser blast in order to hit the target. What's the use of a lock on feature in a rail shooter if it doesn't truly lock on to, and guide your shot to, the target? Godzilla Generations Maximum Impact has two main styles of levels. The first has Godzilla stomping through a major Japanese city causing chaos while shooting down a seemingly endless barrage of helicopters, jets, and tanks. The first time you play one of these levels it may be kind of cool to watch the buildings fall down, or see how many airborne foes you can vaporize but, by the second or third stage, it becomes mind numbingly boring.  The levels become tedious and predictable. The helicopters and jets only fly in one or two different patterns, and after a level or two you'll be able to predict and shoot down nearly 100% of the enemies.  The second level type is a one on one battle between Godzilla and a famous monster from the movie series.  All your favorites are here including Mothra, Space Godzilla, and even Destroyer.  While the destruction levels can be boring, the boss battles manage to be both boring and frustrating at the same time. It's here where the difficult dodging really shines through. Godzilla usually stands in one spot while the monster has its way with him. One would hope that large dramatic battles would be the highlight of a Godzilla game, but sadly that's not the case here. The battles would have been much more enjoyable if Godzilla was able to chase after a monster when it fled, or if he was able to dodge an attack.  Godzilla Generations Maximum Impact isn't the worst Dreamcast game out there (I'd much rather play this than say, Soul Fighter or Chef's Luv Shack), but its not even mediocre. Fans of Godzilla may enjoy the game the first time through, but you'd have to be a super obsessive fan to even want to play past the first couple of levels. Still, it is a better game than the original, although that's not saying much.  Maybe someday a developer will make a good Godzilla game, but until then we'll be stuck with crap like this.  -- Jeremy Conrad, IGN Guides", "date": "Jan 11, 2000"}
