Retaining much of what the original had to offer, NeoGeo Cup 98 Plus is an all-around good title for an on-the-go soccer fan. Features: Story Mode Link cable support Battery Back-up For NeoGeo Pocket Color   If you're a soccer fan, you'd know that the only choice for portable soccer is Tiertex's FIFA 2000 for the Game Boy Color. Noticing the gap, SNK gave us its soccer rendition that in many ways, appears to be a step above FIFA 2000. First off, this isn't your normal soccer simulation game. It contains certain elements that bring a bit of an RPG feeling to it. Namely, you have an item shop where you can purchase little trinkets and accessories to improve your game but you have to be careful since although one item may improve your kick, at the same time it'll hinder your sliding ability.  NeoGeo Cup 98 begins with you, the player, talking to the NeoGeo Cup Chairman who has called on you specifically to lead any of the game's 16 world-renowned soccer teams to the first ever NeoGeo Cup and bring the new league immense popularity. He lets you choose what team you'd take control of including France, Brazil, Italy, USA, and Japan amongst others. Once you choose, you jump right into the short three-game season to decide each team's rank in the playoffs. Each playoff game is do-or-die, so play well.  NeoGeo Cup 98 uses large, detailed character sprites that deteriorates the view of the playing field but gives you a much more crisp environment to play on. However, there's no need to worry where you are as long as you know the painted lines of a soccer field. There are plenty of anime-style cut scenes that reveal a little something about the team's ongoing saga and also just stuff to make it look cool. Sometimes after a game your fans will drop by and congratulate you on the victory, or Dr. Enuffsky will lend his helping hand and upgrade your ~Ostrich Speed~ amulet an extra couple points.  Playing the game is as fun as handling all the aspects around it. It follows all professional soccer rules and regulations as well as all the neat moves and maneuvers seen in the real thing. You have the typical jump, pass, and shoot commands but you also have the fun tricks like the volley or head shots. The shooting scheme is easy; the longer you hold the button, the farther the ball will go. Before each game, you have the option to choose what kind of fielding you'd like to use and do any last-minute substitutions as well as check on your opponent's strengths and weaknesses to counteract them on the playing field.   When you really get into the game, you'll begin to notice the downsides. Primarily, its player management schematics. There's no way for you to switch players on your own, the system does it for you and at times totally ruins a good scoring opportunity. Whenever the computer clears the ball, you may find yourself lost, running the closest playable character in the opposite direction. Your best bet would be to sometimes let the computer run your guys for you until you can either see yourself or get control of the ball. Another downside is its lack of replayability -- the season and playoffs are extremely short and easy (there's no option to change the difficulty), and once you beat it, there is hardly a reason to play it again.     Being a fan of arcade sport sims, I thought this was a fun game to play.  There are plenty of chances to go the length of the field and put it in the goal, which keeps me interested and into the game. If SNK can keep pumping out these fun sporting sims, they'll definitely have an edge over the Game Boy Color.", "date": "Feb 10, 2000"}
