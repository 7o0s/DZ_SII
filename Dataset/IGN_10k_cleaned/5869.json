Microsoft deserves credit for laying the foundation for easy to use multiplayer online gaming, but on this foundation Bungie crafted a masterpiece. For a moment forget the numerous arguments over weapon balancing and the desperate pleas for pistols on Hang'em High. The layout of matchmaking, clans, voice messaging, and the tremendously organized addition of Bungie.net makes Halo 2 the gold standard by which other online console games are judged. On top of the nine new maps, the pack includes an extensive update that addresses cheating and tweaks the gameplay. In short, Bungie has made sure that we spend even more sleepless nights huddled over our TV sets.   So how do the new maps stack up to the original batch? Our first exposure to Halo 2 multiplayer was at E3 2004 where they showcased Zanzibar. This was an interactive, well balanced map that drove our excitement levels through the roof. At the time we assumed that every map would bring the pain in this fashion but the rest of the lineup didn't really meet out elevated standards. Not that the other environments were poorly conceived, but they didn't show the level of detail and polish present on the Zanzibar beach head.   Bungie was under tight deadlines while working on Halo 2 and the majority of their team was focused on finishing the single player experience. The map pack shows what happens when developers are able to give their full attention to a project without having to constantly worry about an impending release date. The maps included in this release have obviously been given the tender loving care that any well-balanced multiplayer environment deserves. There are also a few interactive surprises thrown in that add layers of strategy beyond jockeying for the best weapons and vehicles.   For example, in the asymmetrical level called Terminal a train blasts through the center of the map crushing anything in its way. Cleverly, the plasma sword floats directly in the path of the MagLev forcing players to put their life on the line for the all powerful melee weapon. In Crazy King I've routinely watched players sacrifice their life for a few extra seconds in the zone. Another environment called Gemini is filled with automatic sliding doors, a teleport, and some of the most attractive architecture we've seen in a multiplayer level. The new maps include a well balanced range of small, medium, and large environments. There are also a couple of very straightforward arenas that will nicely compliment the new 2 vs. 2 mode on Live.   One thing that our crack team of Halo players in the office noticed is that some of the maps were very specifically tailored to individual game types. Turf was designed for Territories but doesn't work as well for games of capture the flag. Crazy King or Capture the Flag on Terminal rocks, but there are just too many sniper points to make for very enjoyable slayer matches. Luckily the instruction booklet comes with a detailed description of each map that includes preferred game types and an overhead view of the area with weapon locations.    Halo 2 Multiplayer Map Pack Guide    Our massive guide just got better. Get the guide now! There is actually a lot more included with the map pack than nine new multiplayer environments. Bungie wanted to make sure everything released over Xbox Live was available to the offline community, because as much as Microsoft loves to tout the ever growing number of Live subscribers, the majority of Xbox owners don't play over a broadband connection. Included on the map pack disc is every auto update released for Halo 2. The final update (Halo 2 Version 1.1) includes a set of fixes for cheats and bugs that are described in greater detail here. The update is essentially the kind of patch that PC gamers have expected for years. What we call downloadable content has existed as expansion packs for some time. We have long questioned if online console gaming would eventually take on some of the qualities of PC gaming and it looks like Bungie has taken the first step in this direction.      Also on the disc is an animated short made using the in game engine. It details the events that occurred after one of the Pelicans was shot down by the Scarab when The Chief charges through New Mombassa. This short film (emphasis on short) is entertaining but shouldn't be the basis of anyone's purchase. More interestingly there is a documentary that discusses the creation of the Map Pack and interviews various members of the development team on their involvement with the project. Hardcore Spartans will enjoy the background information provided on each map and the disagreements within the development team concerning level design and gameplay.  It should be noted that the map pack is being scored based on the quality of its content. Discussing the monetary value of nine maps, gameplay updates, and special features opens up a new can of worms. Right now, four of the nine maps in the release are available for free over Xbox Live. If you have a Live account, all of the updates will automatically download upon login. Bungie has also announced that all nine maps will be free downloads by the end of the summer. Depending on each gamer's situation, including how often they play online and whether or not they have a Live account, it may make more sense to buy a subscription and wait for free content instead of purchasing the disc now. The content rocks, but deciding how to obtain it is up to you.   For crazed Halo 2 fans the Multiplayer Map Pack is a must-have item. It may also rekindle interest for people who enjoyed the gameplay but grew tired of the repetition in the play lists. Its unlikely that gamers who never entered the world of Halo will suddenly jump on the wagon just because of some new maps, but Bungie has made clear a number of times that they wanted to create this content to hold the interest of the current community.A couple of weeks after the release of Halo 2 the IGN editors submitted their collective afterthoughts on the game. In my comments I mentioned the lack of a two-player team option and pined for something along the lines of small-team battles. No more than a year later, that feature has been added to the online gameplay options. This is just a small example of Bungie's dedication to cultivating the Halo community. It may not be possible to appease every gamer but with the release of Multiplayer Map Pack Bungie is sure making a valiant effort.", "date": "Jul 6, 2005"}
