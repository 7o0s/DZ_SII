No, because they don't exist. Gauntlet was one of those great, pure arcade games that made a fan out of everybody who dropped their milk money into its hungry, hungry belly.  Features: Action game Multiple mazes Escalating difficulty  Unfortunately, there is no handset adaptation of Gauntlet just yet. But there is Gothic Graveyard from Jumbuck, a me-too little action game that may satiate your ~green elf is about to die~ fix.  You're a chainsaw and flamethrower-weilding maniac, turned loose in a cemetery full of undead nasties. We're pretty sure you can guess what happens next. Using your dual weapons, you must deal death to the ones that apparently cannot die. An intriguing conundrum, for sure. Use your little touch pad to direct your killer around the screen, and press ~*~ or ~#~ to let loose with a fat blast of fire.  While you're scooting around the maze of gravestones, be on the lookout for health power-ups, gas tanks, and other goodies. At the end of each round, the game tallies up how many pick-ups you made.  Be on the lookout for tiny sprites of bats, skeletons, and other Halloween ilk. You have to line yourself up exactly to get a hit in, which can be a little irritating. Same with movement. If one pixel toe is out of a row or column, you're movement is hindered. Some graveyard denizens got in cheap blows because of this. Movement should be a little more forgiving on a system (read: handset) that isn't known for having the best gaming controls.  There is some audio in Gothic Graveyard. It's not particularly spooky, but at least it's there. The graphics are so-so.  Not terribly colorful and the sprites aren't that detailed. But, at least I can tell the skeleton from a bat, which is more than a lot of cellphone games can say. Gothic Graveyard, despite a few shortcomings, isnt a bad little game, and its close proximity to Gauntlet goes a long way. The Splatterhouse setting helps, too. (Oooh, now there's a game Namco needs to update.) It's a fun, cheapie diversion that's certainly not in the same league as, say, Splinter Cell, but isn't a bad second or third choice.", "date": "Sep 18, 2003"}
