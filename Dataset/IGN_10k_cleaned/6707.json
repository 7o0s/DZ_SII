Their prayers haven't been answered yet, at least not fully, since the system lacks a killer-app that just happens to marry a strong story, character development and other RPG staples.   With Generation of Chaos, from developer Idea Factory, fans score the first Japanese-style tactical RPG of the system. It packs the style you'd expect, and even some of the narrative, but it comes up short in the end.  That's not to say Chaos fails at everything it sets out do. That's not the case at all. But for everything it squeezes into such a small package (and it does squeeze a lot) it winds up forgetting key elements that hamper the overall experience. There's a lot do here, especially for those that fancy strategy. But those looking for a user-friendly tactical RPG along the lines of Final Fantasy Tactics won't find it here. Chaos has more going for it than FFT in certain areas, considering the level of control you have over the kingdom, but it's no easy task coming to grips with everything.   Like most of these kinds of games, the story deals with an ancient land with several feuding kingdoms. You're in charge of one of them, and it's up to you to lead an army (several, actually) against opposing forces. Each army has a general leading it, and it's this general you have the most control over. More on that later. You also have a good amount of control over resources, troops and structures from a planning perspective. This aspect of Chaos will probably divide most players more than anything else will.   On the one hand, there's a good amount of freedom and flexibility. You can manage troops, generals, supplies and troop movement. Furthermore, you can shop around for new armor and weapons, maintain the loyalty of your soldiers and even alter the landscape. That's the good part. There's more stuff in here than in most other PSP offerings. Make no mistake about it; anyone craving an in-depth strategy title to stuff in their pockets will love the options in Chaos. But that's not where the story ends, unfortunately. It goes on to include how developers went about implementing said elements - and it's not so good.   For starters, the ~world~ interface lacks a good deal of polish in the visual department. Beyond that, it's simply not designed very well. It's a good bet the average player will find it all a confusing mess, at least for the first few hours of play. As mentioned in the above paragraph, there's a lot of content here, so it's a shame to see it buried under layers of poorly designed menus and inventory screens. You'll invariably struggle to read very small text - a bulk of what's in the menus. On top of that, the text isn't very clear since developers abbreviated most everything to make room for the mounds of information displayed.       And no, it's not a simple matter of consulting in-game help, since it lacks the information necessary to make playing the game any easier. It does help a little, but for a game that cries for an in-depth, easy-to-read instruction booklet this just doesn't cut it. Once you get past the steep learning curve, you'll still need to contend with the dizzying array of commands and subtleties packed into this game. You will, eventually, come to grips with the system, but there's a good chance the average player's patience will run out before then.   In terms of actual combat, Chaos straddles yet another fence. This time, it's between the game's cool-looking, epic battles and the unfortunate fact that playing these battles isn't as cool as it could be. Clashing armies forms the bulk of the appeal here, so if anything needed to work flawlessly it was combat. And while the system does in fact work, and work well, it lacks that special something that would elevate it from ~working~ status to ~awesome~ status.    You control the action through your generals, who take your commands then ~pass~ them off to the army. One of the coolest aspects of these battles allows a general to unleash area-effect spells. These help spice things up a bit, but unfortunately, it's not enough. Ordering your generals and positioning troops lacks the raw appeal found in other tactical strategy games.   Generation of Chaos has a bunch of cool ideas, but a bulk of the appeal lies buried underneath a confusing interface and a poorly designed menu system. There is, however, a good amount of depth for those willing to tough it out. But for those looking for a game along the lines of Final Fantasy Tactics, this really isnt it. Those looking for a deep strategy RPG to take on trips will find something to like in here, provided they understand what theyre getting into.", "date": "Mar 8, 2006"}
