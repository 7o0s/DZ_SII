The classic word-guessing game never loses its general appeal -- Wheel of Fortune is still a juggernaught -- but is it too simple for even the casual mobile scene? Perhaps so, but Vivendi and Centerscore believe they have the answer with people's Choice Hangman, a community-driven game that draws on input from gamers to give the admittedly simplistic game some needed depth.   People's Choice has a web-based tool that lets players jump on and easily create puzzle sets that can later be downloaded on a cellphone. You can either select from the given categories -- famous names, locations, movies -- or create your own topics. I dropped in a collection of arcade classics, for example. Viv will evaluate the submitted puzzle lists and then upload them to the game server so you cab share with friends and strangers.    The actual hangman game itself is pretty straightforward. Every time you select a letter not found in the puzzle, a body part is added to your dangling avatar -- which is really a pretty gruesome for a so-called kids' game, if you step to think about it. If you opt for a hint, you sacrifice two body parts. Selecting letters is easy via the scrolling letter line along the bottom of the screen.   The game screen is pretty spartan but still engaging. The background is a lined sheet of paper and a hand comes on-screen to add body parts to the unfortunate hanged man. Puzzles have different line-art backgrounds, like cityscapes or a sunny desert.  People's Choice Hangman is a clever take on the universally loved game. Without the community input, the game would cease to amuse quickly -- hangman is just too simple to sustain itself for very long. But with users hopping on and uploading lists, the game gets a personal flavor. User-generated content is supposedly the driving force of this Web 2.0 concept, but it's also a very good fit for mobile.", "date": "May 17, 2007"}
