In addition to this, basic Tetris has served as an inspiration and practical bible for all puzzle games. So, today, even after nearly two decades, Tetris is still regarded as one of the most entertaining puzzle concepts around. All this considered, we were fairly interested to see what the next evolution of Tetris would be from current license holder and publisher THQ. We envisioned the company teaming up with Blue Planet, the main force behind current Tetris designs, to create a solid upgrade to past editions, featuring stellar music, inventive visual effects, and modes and extras to spare.    Instead THQ delivered a port of the PlayStation 2 version of Tetris Worlds, regarded as one of the worse Tetris games ever released.  The ~upgrades~ to the GameCube and Xbox versions come in the form of new art, different menus, new music, and a few tweaks on gameplay -- all of which developer Blue Planet sloppily designed in the first place. Certainly Tetris will always be Tetris, but for the retail price of $30 you'll be wasting your money if you were planning on purchasing what is the first Tetris title for GameCube. The combination of poor presentation, lackluster features, and absolutely boring multiplayer mode -- albeit four-player -- makes Tetris Worlds a waste of your time and money.    Features    Six variations of Tetris including normal, Cascade, Sticky, Hot-Line, Fusion, and Square.  First Tetris to feature an actual Story mode, sending you through six different worlds, built and animated in 3D  Four-player support with two-modes of gameplay: Race and Knock-Out  Enter your name to keep track of your best scores     Gameplay  For starters, Tetris Worlds is the first in the series to feature a story mode. It's a novel idea, but one that is feebly executed. There's nothing remotely compelling about the so-called ~story~ and, even worse, the full-motion video sequences that attempt to describe it are quite lame. Even if you're the most accepting Tetris fan, not looking to be dazzled by so much pomp, you won't think twice about the story. You're here to play Tetris, and in that regard Blue Planet actually has included a handful of different modes to play through.   Each of the following modes are played in one of the six different worlds:     Tetris  This is classic Tetris. You manipulate falling game pieces comprised of four different blocks in various shapes (called Tetriminos) to form horizontal rows of blocks that are then cleared from the playfield. You must keep doing this before the blocks reach the top of the screen. Points are scored for clearing lines, and clearing simultaneous lines garners you more points. Clearing four lines at once, which is called a Tetris, rewards you the most bonus points. The idea is to clear the indicated number of lines and rank up. Once you move to the next rank the speed will increase and, of course, you'll have to clear more lines. Go as long as you can stand it.    Square Tetris  This is pretty much the same as classic Tetris. You get the same falling Tetriminos and still get points for clearing horizontal lines. What's different here is that you are also awarded bonuses for creating 4x4 blocks out of the falling Tetriminos and lines cleared that contain these get an even larger bonus. Plus, a T-spin coupled with cleared lines will cause certain blocks to fall, which is called an Avalanche.    Cascade Tetris  Once again, the basic objectives are the same as classic Tetris, but in this mode left over Tetriminos fall into cells below a cleared line as if gravity is acting upon them. If these falling blocks clear lines that they fall into, it is called a Cascade, and you are rewarded with bonus points.    Sticky Tetris  In this play mode you goal is to dig through the blocks on screen and clear the very bottom row of blocks. When a line is cleared, left over pieces will fall through the spaces, and when they fall next to a same color piece, they will stick together. When enough blocks stick together, ~Critical Mass~ is reached and the blocks are cleared. You win by clearing the bottom row of the screen.    Hot-Line Tetris  The objective here is to clear specific pre-marked lines that are called Hot-Lines. There are six Hot-Lines, and your are rewarded for risking it and clearing lines as you move higher up.    Fusion Tetris  With Fusion Tetris, the objective is to connect falling blocks called Atom blocks to the red Fusion Block at the bottom of the screen that's hidden beneath the Garbage blocks. Clearing lines containing an Atom block causes a Cascade, and so on.      We have no real complaints about these basic modes. It's nice to see some variations on basic Tetris. However, the problem is that the gameplay in combination with the lackluster presentation just makes for a very boring Tetris experience. There's nothing that stops you from heading to one of the myriads of sites on the Internet that let you play for free -- even against other opponents from around the world. So, with a boring story mode and equally unimpressive gameplay that's totally old hat, there's very little to enjoy in Tetris Worlds. You'd have to be a really hardcore Tetris fanatic to be willing to plunk down $30 for something you've probably already experienced. The new modes may sound appealing, but in the end they're really just a novelty. Tetris is best played in classic style.    It's important to consider that people buy Tetris on console very often for the multiplayer. Indeed, this is the one area of Tetris Worlds we thought might salvage its worth as it supports up to four players. Sadly, there are only two available variations on multiplayer. You can play the six different modes, but Race and Knock-Out are the only styles you can choose. Race is where you try to clear the indicated number of lines on the screen before your opponent. When you do, the game awkwardly cuts to a ~You Win~ menu screen where you can choose to continue and up the ante with more required lines, or quit. As for Knock-Out, this was our last and final hope. You can cause ~garbage~ blocks to rise up from underneath your opponent(s) if you clear multiple lines at once or form combos. It sounds fair enough, but there is one major flaw -- you are still racing to clear a certain number of required lines. Whenever you do, your screen is totally cleared and you get to start from scratch. It even clears the junk your opponents have sent you. So, for example, let's say you've send a mountain of garbage to your opponent, and they are at their end, about to breach the top of the screen and lose. Suddenly, you notice they only have two lines to clear. You watch in disgust as they calmly clear two lines and all your garbage disappears from the screen. What's the point of even playing Knock-Out if you have such an escape route? Needless to say, we were not very pleased with multiplayer.   Xbox Live  As the game's title might suggest, Tetris Worlds Online lets you challenge Tetris players across the globe via Xbox Live. Online, you can battle up to four players in any of the six game styles and choose between Knock-Out or Race modes. It's exactly like you're playing offline multiplayer, except now you can play against complete strangers. If ranking your Tetris skills globally isn't exactly your cup of tea, Tetris Worlds Online includes an extra game mode called Lounge Play. Lounge Play turns Tetris Worlds Online into a chat program. This mode isn't about the competition - the game simply resets when you clear out your board - instead you casually play Tetris while talking to your friends. Your rankings and statistics are not affected during Lounge Play.   Online matches can sometimes be over in a flash, or they can last several minutes. Once someone wins, you're returned to the game lobby where you can either leave to join a different game or wait for the host to start a new game. Thanks to this system you can have countless, hassle free, rematches.    However, since you're returned to the game lobby between games, anyone searching for a game can jump into your lobby. This has no effect on the game currently in session, but the searcher must wait a matter of minutes for your game to end while staring at the lobby screen. Unless you have an awesome amount of patience, you'll leave that lobby in search of another open game. Basically, you spend more time trying to get into a game than you do actually playing.    With nearly nothing impressive about it Tetris Worlds is dangerous and deceiving territory for would-be buyers. The name implies that it will be great, as it's a core concept that can't be ruined. Much to our disappointment, Tetris Worlds is a step backwards in the progress of evolving it. It's a completely lackluster effort from tip to toe. You can go out and buy any number of more polished, more entertaining puzzle games on systems from the last generation. We highly recommend you do that. And, if you want to play Tetris, just check your favorite search engine and you'll find plenty of free opportunities.    Graphics  In cooperation with Radical Entertainment, THQ has changed the visuals since Tetris Worlds' release on the PlayStation 2 and PC. There's completely new art, but it really doesn't make much of a difference. The touted 3D backgrounds are totally devoid of any life except for the occasional power-up sequence or the growing of foliage as you rank up. Granted you don't want to be distracted from the falling pieces, but there's just nothing going on that's interesting. Even the different lighting and particle effects used to make clearing lines a little more flashy is none too impressive. Everything about the visuals are basic and fairly pointless as to utilizing the next-generation hardware it's on.    Sound  The new collection of songs is new over the previous PS2 and PC soundtrack, but it is still very poorly done. The techno and trance-type tracks are totally mind-numbing and uninventive. Do yourself a favor and go play The New Tetris on the Nintendo 64 and listen to one of the most impressive soundtracks for Tetris ever created. Tetris Worlds' music and sound effects do very little to excite you or compliment the different world themes.  I don't think I've ever been this unimpressed by a Tetris game in my entire life. I've been playing the game since it was conceived in the late 80s. I've seen how profound an influence it has had on modern puzzle game design. But, never, ever have I been so disappointed with Tetris. THQ's Tetris Worlds is below average and even for the discounted price, it's not worth the buy. The intended visual and aural ~improvements~ to the GameCube and Xbox versions were a waste of time. Instead the gameplay should have been totally reworked, especially the multiplayer mode. So, unless you're dying to just play Tetris -- any Tetris -- on your system, don't even bother with Tetris Worlds. The point is that there's nothing new and the peripheral elements such as art and music composition are dull to the point of being abominable.", "date": "Jul 7, 2003"}
