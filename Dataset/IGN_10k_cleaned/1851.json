Deep, complex and beautiful to behold (though exceedingly difficult at times), Earth 2150 succeeded in offering a gaming experience that only a marriage of Alpha Centauri and Total Annihilation could have otherwise achieved. In doing so it also served to quiet all those dissenters of the RTS genre who belittle its gameplay mechanics as little more than ~mass-rush~ hysteria. When a developer gets this much right a follow-up becomes obligatory. The dilemma Topware Interactive faced, creators of both Earth 2150 and The Moon Project, was in not breaking what so obviously did not require fixing. Measured solely by this criterion, they are entirely successful  but the shortcoming of playing it safe in today's competitive marketplace is that everything once heralded as novel and innovative, is now just yesterday's news.     The Moon Project is a sequel, of sorts, to Earth 2150. More accurately stated, it is a work executed in parallel. At the close of Earth 2150 our planet had fallen out of its orbit and crashed into the sun, ending all terrestrial life, as we knew it. Needless to say, that does present a predicament from a storytelling point of view. For decades writers in the comic book industry have solved nasty continuity issues by inventing parallel universes or creating cataclysmic events that wiped out whole storylines, so that they might establish them anew. Sometimes they just pretended that everything which had come before simply never happened  I call that cheating, some might say hack (Justice League anyone?). Topware has pursued a slightly different skew in The Moon Project. All of the events in this game take place within the exact same timeline of the previous game. While that does allow Topware to exploit the tension of the world's imminent demise all over again, it also forces them to deal from the same deck of cards, the result of which a game that feels almost entirely like the one that came before.  Returning to the fray are the same three factions from Earth 2150: the Eurasians (your typical blunt force faction), The UCS (light, quick and agile) and the Lunar Corporation (hi-tech surgical warfare). Each race gets a new campaign, which is told in a largely confusing narrative and just as convoluted as ever. There are a handful of new units and technologies available to each race; like submarines, earthquake generators and artillery  which is the most useful of the three. But the feeling I had was that there should have been more. What might have been interesting, just for instance, is the emergence of a new race to unbalance the other three or the inclusion of generals (with heroic attributes that increase certain traits of the other units in proximity). Ah, but that is the problem of parallel timelines, if you add these now it is in conflict with what took place before.   Visually, things are much improved. A new coat of paint has been applied to the game engine with impressive results, as the 3D terrain engine is now capable of impressive particle effects; making combat an even more viscerally impressive affair than before. Additionally, real-time and colored lighting is in abundance. Day continues to turn into night and weather effects are just as cool as ever. There is also a greater sense of location, as real world settings of San Francisco, Munich and Amsterdam are modeled  so expect snow in Europe and fog in the Bay Area. However, the scale of these geographies are greatly reduced, to the extent that four or five tanks will pretty much cover the entire city of San Francisco  which is really too bad, as the tactical possibilities of blockading the Golden Gate bridge or placing artillery on Alcatraz could have been very intriguing. In the end the limited space is just too cramped to really do anything interesting and this just ends up feeling like a gimmick. Finally, you can also zoom out several more steps from the battlefield, which can really help in the larger battles. However, this will put a strain on even the highest end PC processors.   The hallmark of Earth 2150 was the combination of intense unit-to-unit combat over realistic 3D terrain coupled with the ~mix-n-match~ vehicle construction options. That certainly hasn't changed in The Moon Project. There aren't really any new chassis available, but the new weapons and technological upgrades really help to broaden the tactical possibilities. The AI continues to impress: probing your bases unceasingly, flanking you when you are least prepared and generally backing you into a corner more times than not. Combined arms tactics are therefore a requirement, as the lethality of most weapons (aside from the generally weak machine guns) will easily overwhelm platoons of like vehicles. As you get deeper into the game this situation only worsens, as weapon destructiveness always seems to supersede armor effectiveness. It's great that your units gain experience and become more effective over time, but keeping them alive long enough to realize this is a real challenge. The sluggish pace of new unit production also seriously retards the chances of fielding lesser units to soften up the enemy. Trial and error mark the early game, but willingness to experiment will reward.    One of the detriments of Earth 2150 involved mission objectives. There was simply too much to do in a given scenario and not clear enough direction in how to achieve it. Unfortunately, the situation hasn't been improved in The Moon Project. Consider that most of the missions involve managing a home base (where production occurs), defending a resource camp (where mining and power live) and utilizing an underground series of tunnels for unit movement or recon. Your combat units are spread out across the map and the interface, with all of its layers of detail, makes finding your units and creating new ones a real challenge. The mini map is still way too small and is fixed in one place, the result of which is that you are often guessing as to what direction the threats are coming relative to the on-screen action. During the execution of most missions something invariably happens that derails you from your current objective by introducing a secondary or tertiary goal. I like surprises as much as the next gamer, but most of the time I felt lost. It would have been nice for the descriptions to be clear and straightforward, with only a small set of expectations. In the end, I had to re-read the mission description and review the objectives more than a dozen times per scenario  a classic ~fight the interface rather than the enemy~ problem.   Documentation is only about seventy pages in total, but most of that space is wasted on inane narratives, such as the history of each race or little factoids for each unit  rather than specific details on how to employ them. There are no tables for weapon range, armor effectiveness or rate of fire. Where is the detail on tactical movement, weather restrictions or how to best engage certain types of enemy? Several progressive tutorials are provided, but they are extremely lengthy and must be played straight through. Fortunately, a Prima Strategy guide comes packaged with the game, a major necessity to anyone who might be new to this series. Frankly, I would be happy to pay an additional ten bucks for any strategy game that shipped with a hint guide included  though I realize it is blasphemy to say so.   The Moon Project is both a technically and visually impressive achievement that provides more of what was universally held to be some of the best strategy gaming of last year. While the tweaks applied to the game engine are sweet and certainly helped to immerse me in the game world, they just weren't enough to motivate me to delve deeper into the campaigns. I find it interesting that gameplay occurs in parallel to the events of Earth 2150, but it seems like this may have held Topware back from taking any chances or being innovative, for want of maintaining continuity. I might have felt better recommending The Moon Project had the mission structure been a bit more streamlined, but as it stands this is not a game for the casual player. If you are a strategy devotee who found Earth 2150 the best of its kind, then you will undoubtedly be in heaven, for the rest of us, it's back to Red Alert 2.   -- David Kozlowski Want to share your opinions with the world?Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  or send some mail to IGNPC about this story.", "date": "Mar 20, 2001"}
