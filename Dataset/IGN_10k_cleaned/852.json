There's a certain type of person who can drive around the same track 20 times and still enjoy the game, or someone that can ~race~ around a track never making a right turn and still call it a game at all. There are obviously people who buy and enjoy the games, though, or companies wouldn't make them.   Such is the case with F1 2000. EA Sports' addition to the F1 fold is a novel one, offering all the drivers, tracks, and cars of the official 2000 FIA season while serving them up with an interface that's one of the best in games today. But is it enough to claim the crown from Psygnosis' F1 masterpiece?   Gameplay If there's one thing EA Sports does well, it's utilizing its licenses to the fullest. Every track, driver, car, and car manufacturer from the 2000 season has been brought to the fold here, but the racing that EA actually plopped down into leaves a lot to be desired.   First, there is no arcade option, so ripping around tracks not worrying about tire or body damage and fuel consumption is really out. Yes, there's a single race option, but for some reason, it offers crappier control on an already less-than-stellar control model. You can also opt to race a weekend, which falls somewhere between a full circuit race and that previously mentioned single race. Should you feel the need to race against the clock, you can go with a little time trial action to bang out the best time on your favorite track, or just go for the circuit in the championship mode.   From the championship menu you really get a sense of that kind of tight depth that EA is capable in its games. Not only can you set the race laps, weather, fuel usage, damage, and more, but you're offered the opportunity to actually tune your team strategy. This includes changing your refueling strategy (where you want to fill up in the race -- early, midway through or later on), get a whether forecast, or change your tires. Even though this is a standard in most F1 games, EA does it really well here.  It's a shame that all this depth was thrown into pre-race setup, only to have it all but ruined by some pretty shoddy control. F1 racers are made to turn on a dime, and start and stop with as little distance as possible, but F1 2000's cars are slow to accelerate, slow to stop, and feel like there's glue in the steering mechanisms. It's aggravating to end up in a patch of grass, watching you drop from 5th to 20th just because your car doesn't corner all that well. Fortunately, some car manufacturers offer better control than others, but all of them feel a little too sluggish for an F1 game.   Graphics If there's one thing you can count on with an EA Sports game, it's a kick-@ss intro and a slick interface, and while F1 2000's intro isn't up to par with the usual string of EA Sports games, the interface is a literal work of art.   The usual text selections are framed by a series of rounded-edged squares that play a series of FMV clips in them. The videos may take up one square or a couple, but they're all gorgeous. When choosing your driver, the squares will first display the logo of the respective auto manufacturer, and then show a short CG movie of the car, all within the squares. When you switch menus, the squares slide around changing shapes as needed.   If only the in-game presentation was as good. Sure, the menus are still slick (they're rife with gradients and rounded corners), but the actual race graphics need a little work. As is the case in almost any EA game, the framerate usually hovers at around 20fps, but pack more than a few cars on the screen at once, and it becomes you own little F1 2000 slide show! Neat-o!   Other than the spotty framerate, it's easy to find a lot to love graphically. The tracks are much more colorful and sport many more trackside details that any of the other F1 racing games this year. And while there aren't a lot of special effects, small effects, such as heat waves rising off your engine while you rev it, or reflection mapping on the car, are all extremely sweet eye candy. You'll also get some debris when you hit another car or vice versa, but there's no damage modeling.   You're also able to enjoy the action from one of five different camera angles (behind car far, behind near, in cockpit -- with working mirrors and hands that steer accordingly -- windshield cam, and finally nose cam), and from pretty much any of them, you'll get a great sense of speed.   Sound Aurally, F1 2000 is rather drab. Yes, there are the necessary engine sounds, and they DO change according to what view you're in (a nice though), but once you skid off into the grass of gravel, there's no sound effect to complement it, just your engine sounding like it's going through cardiac arrest. Likewise, the pit crew chatter is suspiciously sparse, offering updates only when you need to pit, and if you're lucky, when someone passes you (which you can usually figure out for yourself anyway). There's also no play-by-play, although the quintessential English announcer, Jim Rosenthal, announces the starting grid splendidly. Rather posh, indeed.  There is NO in-race music, however, and that's a big mistake in my opinion. It doesn't have to be on by default (I haven't run into an F1 game that does have it on my default), but at least enable the option, especially when the game's initial menu music is so great. EA tagged Placebo as the headline musical artist, but unlike Fatboy Slim or Robbie Williams, or The Crystal Method that have graced some of the FIFA titles, their song, ~Every Me and Every You,~ doesn't really fit. Fortunately, the other music is just fantastic. One song in particular stands out: a sick mix of orchestrated crescendos, choir chants, and a steady beat. This creates a bit of a lonely race after such a full musical experience at the menus, especially when you look up and realize that you still have 10 more laps to go, with nothing to hear but your engine. Overall, F1 2000 isn't a bad game by any means. If you're an F1 fan, go give it a rental and see if it floats your boat. But make sure that you've already added Psygnosis' Formula One '99 to your library first or you'll really be missing out.", "date": "Apr 11, 2000"}
