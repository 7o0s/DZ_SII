Instead of creating their own mash-buttons-till-you-pass-out game that attempts to simulate what life is like in the wrestling ring, WayForward went a much different and creative route...building a game around what life is like outside the ring. That's what WWF Betrayal is all about. Though the idea is extremely creative, on the Game Boy Color it just isn't completely followed through to its potential...even with its great concept, don't expect a GBC game that's all that in the gameplay department. Features Four playable wrestlers Six levels Password save Only for Game Boy Color  In WWF Betrayal, you assume the role of one of four different WWF heroes: Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, The Undertaker, and Triple H. After a rough time in the ring, you discover that Vince McMahon's daughter Stephanie has been kidnapped...if you head off and save the girl, Vince will re-instate you as the WWF Heavyweight Champion of the World. So, of course you want the glory...  The game is, essentially, Final Fight with WWF characters, which is impressive in its own right since the brawler genre is all but non-existent on the Game Boy Color system. WayForward's 2D engine handles the design as well as the GBC's 8-bit hardware can handle it. Characters are large and animate with as much detail as you'd expect, and the game scrolls smoothly even with two other large sprite enemies on the screen. Backgrounds have interactive points as well -- cars and vending machines can be smashed open for health powerups. Nummy.  Unfortunately, technical aspects can't help the flat gameplay...each wrestler only has a basic set of moves, with one or two special moves that aren't as special as they should be. The game essentially boils down to players walking to the right, punching or kicking until the enemy disappears into that familiar flicker animation. If they hit enemies in succession without getting hit themselves, they'll build up their power-bar and, when flashing, their next attack is a special move. This power-bar could have been pulled off a bit more dynamically...wrestling fans will want to see the extravagant motions of their favorite wrestlers, but all they'll get is a two or three frame animation that's over quicker than an eye blink.  The balancing also needs a tweak or two, especially in the later levels when enemies wield blasting long-distance machine guns. Once these guys let loose a flurry of bullets, you can easily find yourself stunned in the middle of a fight with no way out. You need to get through each level with the same life, otherwise you'll find yourself right back at the beginning of the round.  WWF Betrayal is an amazingly good idea for a wrestling game, since professional wrestling is more than just the stuff that happens in the ring. It's also great to finally see a brawler on the Game Boy Color, since these games aren't exactly infesting the GBC market. The overall design of Betrayal, though, needs a bit of reworking because of its wonky play balancing and rather plain library of moves. I'd love to see this style of WWF game continue on the Game Boy Advance...but the first try definitely has some serious room for improvement.", "date": "Sep 20, 2001"}
