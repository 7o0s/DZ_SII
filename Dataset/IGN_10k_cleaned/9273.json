It must be true, because that's how they're portrayed in SWAT: Target Liberty, which apparently attempts to replicate the day-to-day actions of some of our most elite public servants -- if said servants were all drooling, inept cretins.    I'm fairly sure that they aren't, in fact, completely incapable of taking out a target standing at point blank range, but both you and your men certainly are in Target Liberty -- to the point of it being absolutely infuriating. Also infuriating: watching your men slowly get gunned down as they stand in place not doing anything; having them be just a few feet away yet completely ignore repeated requests to subdue a perp; sitting behind cover yet still being pegged by incoming fire (but remember, you can't actually hit them if they're in the same position); a completely useless cover system that sticks you to objects and allows you to peek out yet apparently makes all enemy snipers capable of headshots; enemies that appear only after you have walked near them -- even if your squad mates are standing right next to them... and those can all be experienced in but a single mission of Target Liberty.    He looks just about ready to open the door. You know what else you can experience in a single level? The entire 'effing game. With the exception of some expanded abilities, everything you see and do in the first level of the game is carried out through the rest of the game's subsequent missions; you'll check under doors, empty clips in the general direction of enemies, crawl with the blinding speed of a tortoise through the levels while being peppered with enemy fire from gunners off-screen and handcuff the sheeeot out of just about everything that moves in the game, all while listening to the same comments over and over and over again. Should you decide to get a little crazy and interrogate a cuffed suspect, you'll be treated to one of that levels three or four canned responses, all of which will be echoed by all the other enemies in the level with the exception of maybe two or three ~special~ subjects.    The single-player game is literally a copy/paste of the initial moments of the first level, with the environment swapped out. Now granted, some of those environments are actually rather detailed and varied, but the core gameplay never changes save for some very rare moments where you'll take control of a sniper to take out particularly pressing threats. The rest of the time you crawl through each level at a snail's pace until you spot enemies, then you charge them and bop 'em on the head, forcing them into submission.   Gunfire. See, if you can subdue rather than kill the bad guys, you'll be rewarded at the end of the level with experience which slowly unlocks extra abilities for the other members of your squad. You've got guys with nicknames like ~Hollywood,~ ~Python,~ ~Subway~ and ~Gramps~ who excel in things like intimidation (basically screaming at bad guys until they surrender), observation (being able to see enemies outside the incredibly narrow field-of-view afforded by the PSP screen), marksmanship (I'm sure you can figure that one out for yourself) and interrogation (ditto). Generally, finishing missions with as little mess as possible nets you the most experience.     The problem is that many of the skills probably should have been in the game from the start. If you're using a mirror to look under doors, shouldn't you at least be able to see more than a little green circle indicating there's something in the room? Why do you have to level up your marksman so he can hit something within the first three shots? Aren't these guys trained to be crack shots in close-quarters situations? Given that the ranged game is fairly weak and the close-up game really just boils down to bum rushing a guy and then mashing X to beat them into submission with your rifle, most of the combat in the game feels incredibly weak.    Listen up, punk: you suck. Perhaps if there had been a modicum of interest in the storyline (which starts with warring Korean gangs with a penchant for taking hostages and spirals out into a nuclear threat), all of the repetition in the levels would have been tolerable, but to be honest there's absolutely nothing that's gripping about the cutscenes. The dialogue is entirely pedestrian and the characters are as cookie cutter as they come.    Most of this has to do with the game's audio, which regularly reuses the same responses from enemies (there are probably five or six total quips from civilians and gang members and they're recycled like crazy), and the actual voice acting can be laughably bad -- usually because of the horribly forced accents. The soundtrack isn't much better, popping up mainly in the menus and looping incessantly in the background.   I know I mentioned the variety in environments earlier, and I really do have to hand it to developer 3G, as they clearly spent plenty of time in peppering the levels with detail. Nothing beyond the doors is actually interactive in each stage, but stuff like shelves stocked with cans and office spaces with crap strewn everywhere at least keeps the game from looking crappy -- even if the gameplay counters all that effort and then some. The ragdoll animations aren't quite as polished, either. Enemies go lock-limbed instantly, and though I'm not expecting mind-boggling levels of animation, games like Killzone: Liberation showed us that it's certainly possible to do.   Intense action! Yeah! I can't help but feel like there's a good game somewhere in Target Liberty, but there's so much that's working against the overall experience that it may not have been worth saving in the first place. There's certainly room for a tactical isometric shooter, but that game is going to have to be at least half as good as the high water mark set by Killzone: Liberation, and this game doesn't even come close.", "date": "Oct 18, 2007"}
