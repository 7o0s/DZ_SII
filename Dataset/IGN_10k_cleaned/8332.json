The American icon began his life as a unique comic book character in 1938. Penned and written by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the Man of Steel debuted in Action Comics' first issue and has been overwhelmingly popular ever since. Almost 60 years later, Superman is still an American favorite, appearing in everything from comic books to television shows, movies and cartoons. So it should come as no surprise that the figure described as ~faster than a speeding bullet,~ has raced to a Nintendo 64 near you. Unfortunately for Nintendo 64 owners though, the Titus Software-developed game is executed so poorly that it actually serves to butcher the reputation of the prominent action hero.The Facts Play as Superman through 14 alternating indoor/outdoor levels. Use the Man of Steel's special abilities for flight, heat vision, freezing breath, super-strength and X-ray vision. Pick up and use objects as weapons. Battle on land, underwater and in the sky against such villains as Metallo, The Parasite, Darkseid and Lex Luthor's minions. Four-player compatible modes. Game comes with ~collector's edition Superman comic book.~The StoryThe history behind Titus' 3D polygonal Superman is long and filled with setbacks. The game was originally scheduled to debut close to a year ago, but was pushed back due to a less than stellar reaction from Electronics Entertainment Expo '98 showgoers. With concerns ranging from gameplay hindering framerates to unforgivably unresponsive controls, it was certainly a wise decision on Titus' part to hold back the title. The problem is that the recently released finished product still has these flaws, bugs and oversights. In fact, the game is practically drowning in them. Perhaps the biggest problem of all, though, is that the game just isn't very fun.As far as storyline goes, straight from the game's instruction booklet we are informed that, ~Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen have disappeared -- they've been kidnapped by the malevolent powers of Lex Luthor and Braniac, who have brought them into a virtual reality version of Metropolis.~ Not exactly an epic tale, but it sure beats Titus' previous explanation for the game's graphic flaws -- namely that a thick screen of fog present in the title was in fact ~Kryptonite fog~ deployed by Lex Luthor himself to destroy Superman.Right.Imagine if all developers explained their game's visual limitations in storyline. ~No, no -- those are not jumpy framerates you are seeing. Superman is merely drunk, which also blurs his vision considerably.~Or maybe, ~You've got it all wrong, that is not clipping. Superman is simply using his X-Ray vision to look through the walls.~ While it would certainly make for some interesting story additions, it would most likely also rapidly ruin the gaming industry.GameplayGamers take control of Superman through 14 missions that range in size and difficulty. Some levels see the Man of Steel racing through the skies of Metropolis, picking up automobiles (and other objects) and hurling them across the city at enemies, while others take place deep underground or even underwater. Each level begins with an objective that must be accomplished by everyone's favorite superhero. In some cases this can be as simple (in theory) as flying through rings (much more difficult than it sounds thanks to unbearable controls), while later levels put forward more difficult tasks such as retrieving access cards and/or disarming bombs.Superman is manipulated with the analog stick. The Z button works to send the superhero soaring into the air or, if players are already airborne, to land. Because controls are so clumsy, it often takes six or seven taps of the Z button before Superman will do anything other than stutter around retardedly. Once airborne, controlling the Man of Steel is a whole other adventure altogether. Strangely, he seems to be neither faster than a speeding bullet nor more powerful than a locomotive. Actually, the sluggish polygonal mutant Titus has created moves more like a hovering couch. Turning around can take five or six seconds, while landing and taking off sometimes feel as if they're completely up to chance.~Hello! I pressed the damn Z button. Is he going to do anything?~ The answer, more often than not, is no.The method by which objects are picked up (or not) in Superman is reason enough to think twice about the game. Though it says in the instruction booklet that ~flying into an object automatically picks it up,~ we found this to be completely untrue on multiple occasions. Rather, flying into an object resulted in Superman convulsing and flying around it or, even better, picking it up for a split second and then flying on without it. The training mission is a perfect example of this. In it, Superman must pick up a car on the street before Lex Luthor's minions can blow it up. Worse yet, the Man of Steel has only a few seconds to execute the act before a timer runs out and the player loses. Okay, this seems like a fair goal, right? Not always. Sometimes the level starts and Lex Luthor's minions blow up the car right off the bat, long before Superman can ever reach it. How is that fair? Supposing the AI gives players a chance the next time around, it's often so difficult to pick up the vehicle before the computer-controlled characters blow it to smithereens that it's just not worth the effort.And then we come to the various bugs of the game. After 10 minutes of play, we found a neat little feature that let us clip through all of the walls in Superman's universe. At first we thought it was X-Ray vision, but when we reappeared in the regular world only to be knee-deep in floor, well, something seemed a bit out of place. Pathetically, we found ourselves having more fun walking through walls than we did playing the working game. Other fun ~features~ include sometimes nonexistent collision detection and worthless AI that automatically shoots above Superman's shoulder.Multi-Baffling ModeImagine controlling multiple versions of Superman with friends. Imagine soaring to the tops of skyscrapers, circling around, shooting off your X-Ray vision and then freezing an opponent with your breath. While that certainly might have been a good idea, Titus has taken another approach entirely. Rather than using Superman in the game's multiplayer mode, players control one of Lex Luthor's minions and flying through levels is done via spaceships. Makes perfect sense if your absolutely insane.The multiplayer feature, which supports up to four people, can be played in battle or race mode. Battle mode plays very much like a poor man's version of Forsaken. Dumbed down graphics, tunnel-like levels (minus one wide-open city arena) and one gun animation. Though multiple different weapons are obtainable, they are only represented with a change of sound. Instead of bleep, players get bloop. Woo-hoo! The one good thing about this mode is its smooth framerates -- something not even the single-player game can achieve.Race mode, on the other hand, is completely baffling. Not only do players control more spaceships (why?), but rings shoot from the backside of one opponent. We played with this mode for a short while before giving up in utter confusion. Later we cried and decided never to speak of the so-called ~race~ again.GraphicsUnfortunately, Superman is not saved by its eye-popping graphics. The game has this very rushed, careless feel about it that overflows into its visuals. In a smothering field of fog sits Metropolis. Superman can fly up into fog or down into fog. Straight ahead, meanwhile, awaits more fog and behind, good old fog. Amazingly enough, all of this fog does little to tame the title's jittery, sometimes slideshow-like framerates. Honestly, there are occasions where the framerates drop so low that the game becomes nearly unplayable.And it's not as if all of Nintendo 64's power has gone to animation routines. Superman and friends feature an estimated 20 frames of animation between them. Punching is done with two or three frames, while flying eats up four or five. Everything -- and we do mean everything -- looks very robotic and unconvincing. The animated series of which this game is based on will never be known for its top-quality animation, but compared to the game it looks like a multi-million dollar Disney feature film.Clipping also plays a major part in this ~virtual Metropolis.~ Maybe it's because Superman is in a virtual reality world, but everything from trees to buildings and enemies clips, especially when the Man of Steel is up close and personal. Top everything off with the fact that the game runs in constant letterbox mode and we think we have a winner -- er, loser. This is not a visually striking game. The only thing moderately good we can think to note about it is that it's not blurry.SoundThe sound samples in Superman are actually very well done. The problem is that there are only a handful of them. In the beginning of the game we hear Lex Luthor say, ~In short time your fate will be sealed, Superman.~ The level begins and Superman says, ~Then there is no time to waste.~ That sounded pretty good, we say to ourselves. Then the next level kicks in and Superman says, ~Then there is no time to waste.~ It's at this point that we begin to wonder what the hell is going on. The next area kicks in and the Man of Steel says -- you guessed it -- ~Then there is no time to waste.~ This also happens whenever a player dies. Flying up to the limits of the sky, on the other hand, gives us a whole new sound sample of Lex Luthor laughing. This is meant to mean that Superman cannot escape the virtual reality world, no doubt.The music in the game is doable, though it does become more and more repetitive as levels progress. It's obvious that sound effects and music were not one of Titus' main priorities for Superman. Now that we think about it, though, we're not sure if the developer put forth any priorities for this title other than to finish it.Having grown up with the Man of Steel, Superman for Nintendo 64 is a huge, whopping disappointment for me. In fact, the game is so all-around poorly executed that it's downright offending to people like myself who have enjoyed the comic books, movies, television shows and more based upon the America icon. Not only is this sub-par effort one of Nintendo 64's worst games, it serves as even more proof that it takes more than a solid license to make a solid game.With horrible control, unforgivable framerates and more bugs than can be counted, Titus should be absolutely ashamed of this awful game, and the company should be doubly ashamed for pissing all over such a beloved license.Do not buy this piece of garbage.", "date": "Jun 3, 1999"}
