And rightfully so, because it's a horrible game. With some of the weakest graphics, worst gameplay and most annoying sound ever to come from the NES, spending 500 Points to download this trainwreck would be ludicrous. Stay away from this one, no matter what.   Kage is a ninja. A ninja with a mission. He's a dual-wielding, tree-hopping assassin from ancient Japan, pledged to save the kidnapped Princess Kiri from an evil shogun. Kage sounds pretty cool  but he's not. Because Kage wears a dress. The first and most obvious negative aspect of The Legend of Kage is its extremely simplistic graphics, that, because of their use of only a handful of pixels to make each character, make the manly hero look like a girl. Or a stick figure. Or a kindergartener's Crayola doodle.   Six-year-olds have rendered more realistic ninja scenes in MS Paint than what you'll find in The Legend of Kage, as its graphics are some of the worst to be found on Nintendo's 8-bit NES.  It's a shame, too, because the NES was certainly much more capable than this, and it's damaging to the image of that hardware to see games like this chosen for the Virtual Console lineup. But even more damaging than seeing it is playing it.          Kage dies in a single hit. One sword slash, one shuriken, one burning fireball launched from the mouth of a magic monk  that's all it takes. Fall to the ground, dead, start over. That's not so uncommon for an '80s game. After all, Contra was the same way. But Kage's one-hit deaths just feel cheap, because more often than not they're the result of fighting against the game's stilted, stiff, floaty controls.   Kage can leap high into the air, climb trees, swing his kodachi and throw his special star knives. It seems a fair array of abilities, and would be if it were easier to move. When you jump and reach the apex of your ascent, Kage's downward motion is straight down. Uncontrollably straight down, meaning you're at the mercy of any stray shuriken or flying, striking foe until your feet find purchase again, on the ground or on a tree branch. It's offensive to ninjas everywhere that Kage is a representative of their skill.   And even more offensive is the game's length. In the time it's taken you to read this far into this review, you could have started a new game of The Legend of Kage and already saved the princess. Seriously. The amount of time it would take you to turn on your Wii, access the Wii Shop and download this game is longer than the amount of time you'll spend playing it, either because you'll finish its quest in minutes or because you'll be so annoyed at its failings that you'll just turn it off. But please don't test that theory. Don't let even scientific curiosity trick you into paying for this game.  It's a shame that The Legend of Kage on the NES, and now on the Virtual Console, is such a disappointment. The game actually began life as a serviceably playable arcade coin-op cabinet, published by Taito in 1985. But the downgrade in graphics, sound and feel of the gameplay was so severe in its port to Nintendo's home system that any kind of fun the arcade original may have held was washed completely away. The Legend of Kage is a horrible game. Stay away from it, no matter what.", "date": "Feb 21, 2007"}
