Capcom, responsible for such hits as Resident Evil and Megaman, teamed with veteran wireless developer Lavastorm Engineering top bring some of its classics to the smallest of screens, including the shooter Commando.   Commando is as straight forward as an action game can be. As the grunt Joe, you must clear out screen after screen (after screen) of faceless enemy soldiers with your trusty machinegun and a small supply of bone-shattering grenades. The game shows its arcade roots at every turn, with simple but engaging game play as you strive to clear the five levels of baddies.   Control is incredibly simple. Your machinegun is on permanent auto-fire -- apparently you have an endless clip full of the white pixels. It only takes a single shot to drop a bad man to the dirt. However, your bullets don't travel across the entire screen. You must sometimes get in close to ventilate a foul trooper. And if you're not careful, it will be you that ends up wearing holy garb. Some enemies hide behind bunkers, which require grenades to clear out.   But is this any fun? Is it worth the few bucks? If you're into classic arcade games on the go, then Commando has some worth. But the game is just so simple that its hard to keep that engagement going for more than a level or two.   Commando is not pushing your phone to the limit. Visually, the game looks remarkably like its NES roots. If you're a fan of brown, blue, and green -- you will be impressed with Commando. The game plays an endless loop of music, but no sound effects. Them's apparently the trade-offs you have to make with handset games.Many classic arcade games are called ~classics~ just by benefit of their age. Commando is almost one of them. The game never made a big impression on me in arcades, but if you're a fan a simple shooting action, Commando is likely a purchase to consider. However, there are other titles out there that offer simple shooting action that probably should be DL'd before this. Kudos to Lavastorm for the good port, but if you're wanting to download an old Capcom game, look for Megaman.", "date": "Oct 12, 2004"}
