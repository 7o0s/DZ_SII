That's the beauty of a Warlords or a Master of Magic -- they have more replay value packed into one line of code than fifteen hundred dollars worth of all those flash-in-the-pan best sellers.  There's a reason why I mentioned those old games, and will keep mentioning them and other classic strategy games throughout this review. It's because Age of Wonders borrows (or steals, if you prefer) from these old games left and right. But who cares? Since we can count the number of good, turn-based fantasy strategy games on one hand, having a new one that reworks the best elements of each and carefully knits them together is a good thing. But this is not a clone; there's enough innovation in Age of Wonders to make it stand on its own.  Age of Wonders comes with one full campaign, playable as either the Good or Evil side, and for once, the backstory isn't a half-assed pastiche of Tolkien. Instead we're treated to a rather interesting tale of how Humans first came to this land, caused a rift amongst the Elves, and eventually threw the whole continent into chaos. When you finish the campaign, there're plenty of standalone scenarios to whittle away the hours, as well as a fully-featured editor that -- even if you never use it yourself -- guarantees that other fans out there are making plenty of new scenarios for you to fool around with in the months to come. I've already seen user-made maps of Middle Earth and Norrath, and the editor is powerful, easy to use, and a lot of fun to play with.  But whether you're playing a standalone scenario or one of the campaign missions, the game is basically the same, and before you begin, there are some options you can tweak. For one, 'exploration' is turned on by default, meaning most of the map will be grayed out since it hasn't been explored. I don't think I ever played with exploration turned off, since that would be cheating and would take away the fun of exploring. You can also customize your leader before a scenario (and you probably should, and you should pretty much put all your leader's points into spellcasting, since once you get through your early conquests you won't ever want to risk the king again, but leave him in the capital casting global magic). Ninety-five percent of the leader's other abilities are ultimately useless, in my opinion.  Another option is whether or not to have the leaders on the map. If you do, it gives you an extra hero, but if your leader dies, your empire collapses. Alternately you can leave your leader off the map, safe but much more useless. Besides your leader, you can also have other heroes leading your armies (though they're not required, as in HOMM, but helpful). Like Gandalf at Bag End, these heroes just sort of show up randomly at your door one fine morning and offer you their services. And like Master of Magic, you can also summon them through a spell, and sometimes you'll rescue them out of dungeons. But one drawback to playing with the ~leaders on the map~ option is that the AI is not always as adept at protecting its leaders as you are, so sometimes it's really easy to knock out a rival empire with a quick strike on its capital.  Finally, you can choose between turn-based or simultaneous movement. In simultaneous movement, you and the AI players all move your units (to their maximum movement rate) at once. While this makes the movement phase a little more frantic, I didn't care for the way the game slowed down, so I just stuck with classic turns.  You'll usually begin a scenario with at least one city. Cities are of paramount importance in Age of Wonders because they generate a lot of your income and they're where you'll build most of your troops. There are other unit and resource-generating locations on the map -- shipyards, gold mines, farms, and manna nodes -- and these are important, but the cities are crucial, not the least because they're the easiest to defend. Each city is managed through a separate mini-screen, but unlike a city in say Civilization or Master of Magic, you don't have to build a whole slew of buildings to upgrade the city, nor do you have to tweak luxury settings or the like to keep the populace happy or well-fed. Instead, contentment is abstracted through the racial relations portion of the diplomatic screen, and city improvements are handled through three (extremely expensive) abstracted upgrade levels.  Furthermore, city locations are determined by the scenario designer, so the feel of the strategic game is closer to a Warlords or Heroes of Might & Magic than a Master of Magic or Civilization. This means several things. Since Age of Wonders is a map-driven game, and there is no way to randomly generate a map (guh?), replayability isn't infinite like in Civ or MoM. More to the point, it also means you can't send settlers out to found new cities, and the cities you start with or capture along the way aren't going to grow or dwindle. They can be razed or looted, like in Warlords, but you can't build new ones. The game designers probably chose this deliberately, probably to avoid the pitfalls of the Civ-style, end game, micro-management blues, but realism does take a hit, and I was mildly disappointed by this. Why not an auto-manage city feature, like Alpha Centauri?  One thing you can change about your cities is their race. The manual makes a big deal about how important race relations are, but as a player it's only critical in one key area: assimilating newly conquered cities. After you capture an enemy town, the population doesn't immediately become loyal robots obeying your every whim, as they would in say Civilization (assuming you gave them enough luxuries). Instead the game follows the Master of Magic model, where each city you conquer retains its original ethnic identity, be it dwarf, elf or whatever. So if you're a Dark Elf warlord there might be some dissatisfaction in a Dwarven city you've conquered, especially if you're at war with the Dwarven Kingdom. And yes, and if you're not careful and heavily garrison such a place, a city will rebel. This is a touch of realism: it's not enough just to conquer, you must also rule.  But this is easily circumvented -- too easily -- by the ~Migrate~ feature, which means simply that if you occupy a city long enough, by setting it to ~Migrate~ rather than building units or generating cash, then in a couple of turns the local population can be replaced by your own kind. So say you're the Lizard Men, you've just conquered a neighboring Halfling town, and the fat blighters aren't being real cooperative, in fact they're tying down your garrisons. What to do? Move in some Lizard Men settlers in their stead. That's right, even the so-called 'Good' races like Elves and ~High Men~ are encouraged -- nay obligated -- to practice ethnic cleansing in order to survive. The game never actually depicts your Lizard Men massacring Halflings, but you have to assume that's what's going on.  Furthermore, it's not even clear where your new settlers are coming from, as your original cities suffer no population hit.   Even worse, this doesn't even make sense in the game's own time scale, where one turn equals one day. So you're forced to believe that a once-thriving city of Hobbits is going to be wiped out and replaced by an equal number of Lizard Men, who are going to pick up in all that industry and trade and farming, in less than a week. Not only is this morally ambiguous (to put it kindly; shouldn't the 'Good' races suffer some sort of penalty for this?) but it's patently unrealistic as well. Nonetheless, in almost every instance, the rules of the game dictate that you should first migrate your own people into a hostile city, then fortify it.  That leads into our second problem: fortification. It's easy, it's cheap, and the computer AI scarcely knows what to do against a built-up town with walls. Since you can see with your own eyes that a city has walls, and won't attack it without a wall-breaking unit like a cannon or giant in your ranks, the game's overall challenge becomes somewhat marred. It's too easy to fortify all your towns, leave a token defender to hold it, and then take the rest of your force out for more conquest and slaughter. Yet at the same time, unless you put the computer AI on its hardest setting, the AI is reluctant to fortify, meaning it's usually pretty easy to take its cities.  Not that I have a big problem with putting all the non-player empires onto the hardest AI setting -- in fact you have to, if you want a challenge -- except for one thing: at this setting, it also cheats. I'm not 100% sure that they're getting extra money and manna at this setting, but their NPC heroes are certainly going up levels at a ridiculous rate; I don't know how many times I'd find myself in a battle against some warrior hero at level 20 or more, when my highest level hero was only fifth or sixth level. Even after the first patch (version 1.1), the AI kept cheating, although the patch did noticeably improve the AI's otherwise lackluster decision-making. The designers also compensated for the AI by making the campaign missions at times infernally picky and difficult, so I actually had a lot more fun with the standalone scenarios and fiddling with the editor.  All right, so the strategic AI had some problems, but fortunately the tactical AI is much better. When two armies meet in Age of Wonder, the game switches to a mini-game, a tactical inset. Yeah, yeah, just like Master of Magic and Heroes of Might & Magic, but hang on. The Heroes tactical game I never really cared for -- the map is just too darned small! It always looked like two teams lined up to play Blood Bowl. So I always preferred the Master of Magic method where they put the whole city there on the map, and there's plenty of room for you armies to maneuver, and some random seeds gave the tactical game some correspondence to the overland map.  Well Age of Wonders outdoes both those games. These tactical maps are huge and what's more interesting is not only do they represent the hex that the two army stacks are fighting over -- they also include the six surrounding hexes, meaning that all armies from either side who are in those spaces are also drawn into the combat, and their starting positions in the tactical mini-game reflect their overland positions. Wow. This is cool. So even while each hex has a stacking limit of eight units, if you properly flank your attacking armies with additional units you can really use the weight of numbers to crush your foe. This is how it should be done, and makes movement on the overland quite critical, and the result is a lot more satisfying. I also liked how each mini-map has all kinds of random terrain features on it, depending on what the overland terrain map was; ice hexes, for example, are practically bare, while forest and town hexes are dense with obstacles. You don't have to fight every single tactical combat, though, as you can opt for a Warlords-style automatic battle instead.  The tactical game also does a great job taking into account obstacles like walls and haystacks and even intervening units. For example if you're firing a missile unit at a distant foe, little circles will pop up showing you what percentage chance there is that your shot will hit something else in the way first. There are also exits on the tactical mini-maps, so you can selectively choose to have some troops flee the battlefield, too.  So what else is on the map? There are your usual trees, deserts, hills, mountains, rivers and oceans, but what's nice is that terrain isn't always just a brute obstacle. For example, most of the Lizard units can swim, while most of the Dwarf units have mountain-climbing, so they can clamber through mountains that most units will find impassable. Spells like water walking and flight can change the impassability of terrain, naturally enough, and you can even build roads and towers to speed movement and keep watch over critical areas. Other key features include manna wells and special power nodes that let you build up some very powerful spells that can periodically devastate nearby units and drastically alter the landscape.  There are also dungeons and crypts and the like which you can explore with your army, and if you defeat the guardian monsters you'll be rewarded with magic items or prisoners. This is similar to Warlords, except here you can actually go inside the crypt as part of the tactical mini-game. Neat.  But the most interesting features on the overland map are the subterranean regions. Master of Magic had those connections from the daylight world to the night world (well, they pretended it was two different planets, but that never made much sense; I always sort of assumed it was a subterranean world underneath the other one). Anyway, Age of Wonders has not just one but two different subterranean levels. Furthermore, most of the subterranean world is dirt, which can be dug through with the right units (kind of like in Cave Wars), which adds all sorts of interesting strategic problems -- is your city truly safe, if an enemy might come tunneling through the earth right towards it? Not every scenario uses the full extent of the Underdark to its advantage, but it's a neat feature to have, especially when you're editing a scenario.  I could go on and on about many of the other different parts of the game, like the magic system, how units acquire experience, how leaders get levels, but for the most part, it takes the best elements from older games. Your leader picks magic spheres to specialize in, like Master of Magic, and you have to manage manna as a resource as well as gold, with which to power your spells. Research and channeling are greatly simplified though. Likewise, units that excel in a battle gain little silver and gold medallions, demonstrating that they are more experienced, and so more deadly. That's just something you'll encounter again and again in Age of Wonders: you know how something works, because it's just like how it was in this other game. But like I said before, this is a good thing, because the rules that are borrowed make sense to begin with, and a lot of time was spent in balancing the different bits and pieces of all these different rules together so that everything works well together. This is an extremely well-balanced and finely-tuned game.  And that pretty much brings us to the end, though I should say something about the window dressing, like the sound effects and graphics. None of the music inspired me (and when are game designers just going to build in an MP3 player into every game?) and the sound effects are serviceable but bland. And you can tell by these screen shots that most of the map and unit art is gorgeous, but the character portraits of the various leaders aren't exactly top-flight fantasy illustration. That's forgivable, but you can't always tell with a glance what race they're supposed to represent, which is not. This is most problematic on the diplomacy screen, where what race you're talking to is important, and this error is further compounded by a bad design decision: using the leaders' names rather than the race names for interaction. Thus you're forced to click on some bearded guy and guess: well, hmmm... is he the leader of the Dwarves, Humans, or Frostlings? Eventually you'll learn which color goes with which race, but with twelve different races in the game, that won't happen right away.  Anyway if you are at all interested in turn-based strategy games with a fantasy theme, go get this game. Then definitely get the newest patch, remember to change the AI settings to 'Lord', fool around with the scenarios and the editor, and before you know it winter will be over and you'll wonder where all your time went. And that's about all you can ask from a strategy game.  -- Jason Bates", "date": "Dec 7, 1999"}
