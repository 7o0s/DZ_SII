Depending on the title, it can lead me to contentment, gloriously titillating lands overrun with many scantily clad Shiri and Charisma clones where I am equally content, or even fill me with grandiose delusions of storming into the developer's offices strutting my towering intellect and tyrannically commanding them all to make a better game with a booming voice that would force Unicron to shudder in a pathetically frightening Conrad-esque manner. MTV? ADD? Regardless, I'm no longer capable of devoting my full, undivided attention to what I play -- enjoying what's to be enjoyed and dismissing what should be burnt with furious rage.  Celtic Kings elicits none of the above fantasies. Rather, it's an inconspicuous, noble, and solid strategy title with RPG elements that comes built well enough to never give me cause to question my belief in videogaming as a valid hobby. It's also not incredibly boring, forcing my still adolescent self to blankly stare off into the void of an unpowered television set wishing it were on and enhancing my mental prowess with tales of Undressed and elimiDATE. Unfortunately, Celtic Kings is also not perfection, so we'll not find irreproachable bliss here.   The problem is that we PC gamers are doomed to wade through a flood of strategy titles for the rest of eternity. Certainly there are just as many of this genre as there are of some others (by others I mean FPS), but this is the most time consuming of the overdone. No productive or sane member of civilized or Arkansan society could ever hope to play them all, let alone buy them all. Thus the truly great get enjoyed by the masses while all the rest get piled onto the all consuming furnace.   So here we stand. A respectable, commendable effort sits on my desk beckoning for further play, while a few dozen others rest nearby in a grossly overfilled CD case, demanding the same. What to do? What to do?   Cutting to the chase, Celtic Kings is good. But, whether or not quality warrants purchase in this case is a decision you'll have to make on your own. There are many other comparable and better strategy titles about. Another run of the mill RTS this is not, but it's enough like the rest to justify a cautious try before you buy attitude, even though it's ultimately rather peachy.  A long time ago a very powerful guy, Caesar, ruled a big ass nation fuelled by ambition, professionalism, sin, and greed. It was called Rome. At one point in time he sent his Roman legions to conquer the prideful and religious Gauls (some other, yet to be stepped on collection of assorted peoples). When Rome orders a capture or conquer, what it really means is, ~Burn the whole damn place to the ground.~  Then there were the Germanic Teutons, a self-gratifying tribal society comprised of fierce warriors who sought immediate gain at the expense of the bigger picture. They're contrasted by the magically endowed Druids, who alone wield the power to crumble nations or keep Aaron Spelling in a position of power.     This is the universe of Celtic Kings, an intentionally historically inaccurate game that thrusts players headlong into the conflict between the Romans and Gauls (as either side).  Hybrid ideology at its finest, Celtic Kings all at once plays both like an RTS and rudimentary RPG. Both styles are catered to throughout the adventure, skirmish, and multiplayer modes of which the game is comprised. Adventure is the equivalent of campaign, story, singleplayer, what you play when you're alone and without a phone line... The other two should be rather self-explanatory, as if the first wasn't.  What first struck me about Celtic Kings was the sheer amount of gamer consideration that was put into development. This title is filled with a lot of solid ideas and an even better presentation.   It starts with the awesome in-game help system for us who can't be bothered to remember what the difference between a Praetorian and a Principle is. Always accessible, a variety of topics in a neatly organized and illustrated fashion are covered here (basics, units, and so forth). There's also the obligatory interactive tutorial, which acts as a prelude to the main campaign and handles things in a very cool RPG-like manner. Skipping through branching conversations and cutting to points of interest is a snap. Indeed, seeing what's important without weeding through what's not is simple. I like not being forced to listen to inane prattle. I also like being able to learn without falling asleep. It's enough to get started, and since the game is rather accommodating, enough to stave off the dreaded first time fumble until the next batch of newness comes along. More hints on formations and so forth would have been helpful, but it's really not missing much. Kudos.      This level of polish carries over to the bulk of the game, too. Clever play additions make dropping bounding boxes and clicking to order simpler and more intuitive. Check this out: Select a mass of units. Now, hit a hotkey combo and that selection can be separated by health or experience. This is an invaluable tool when used properly because with a simple key depression all of the units within the bounding box can be organized and distinguished by low health, medium health, or experience level. A major gripe with RTS games that have tried to incorporate valuable veteran status into their units was that they'd be lost too easily. This method makes grabbing the strong who also happen to be weak and then getting them the hell out of the fray that much more manageable and thus that much better. These little touches permeate throughout the entire game and pull the package together quite admirably.   RPG aspects encompass everything (unit advancement, conversations, storyline, even inventories), but centrally revolve around required and purchasable heroes that, in keeping with the rest of the game's appreciable considerations, are very usable and very manageable.   Elementarily twisting Conquest's admiral system, it's now possible to order these white horse mounted heroes about, at which point those units assigned to follow them will carry out their orders. It's not nearly as complex as I may have made it sound. In actuality, simply select however many units you'd like to follow a leader and then only control that leader, having him perform tasks at your discretion. The attached men and women will be subject to a percentile increase of their skills based on their hero, and will act as he does, as if they were a single unit. No micromanagement is performed by the heroes as is sort of done by Conquest's admiral system. So running out of food (a necessary supply) means starving to death, as they haven't the good sense to call for a food bearing horse, or arrange to meet one at a waypoint of sorts.   It's with the heroes that the game's few formational choices come into greater play, for the most part, battles quickly degenerate into hectic melees, but coming in with a strong coordinated rush can be just as important as having more or better units. It's all not nearly as precise and epic as Medieval. No, these battles are far more akin to the traditional RTS: large groups of units, lots of action, plenty of paper rock scissors type play that's only outdone by simply overpowering with raw numbers.   Even simple unit grouping has been refined. Units can enter buildings, see. When doing so, it's possible to still command them via the assigned hotkeys you've given to a group (groups can also retain multiple hotkeys, so a fellow can be a member of 1, 9, and 8 if so desired). Heck, just walking about is kind of neat -- the exploration button helps scatter your units about so that they can check out the surroundings, uncover the fog of war, and still stay relatively near where you sent them.  And it goes further, each of the game's immense maps (playable in variable seasons, mind you) house some 5000 units, and are looked after via a surprisingly effective full screen map mode, where orders can be carried out and supplies transferred.    That's a lot of cool to be had, but there are still several points of contention. For one, fleeing from anything seems to be a rather futile effort, but can help lure out an enemy force if done properly. Since it seems people can strike while running, or only need to pause momentarily to do so, pulling out from a fight means sustaining heavy causalities all the way back to base, since the AI is tenacious to say the least. Thankfully, the computer doesn't move as the bird flies and will often erratically run about. Capitalizing on this is as simple as sacrificing a few peons and keeping the swarm of baddies guessing. AI prioritizing is decent, but not the smartest thing around, so squads of cavalry will happily tear apart weak minions, providing ample time for an escape and rally effort. It's like turning several problems into something that works, but that still doesn't make it right.       And a few other inconveniences bug. Range for siege units like the catapult should be seen before deployment. Essentially a group of soldiers amass and combine to form the single more powerful unit. Putting together a stationary offensive weapon in front of likely targets is a risky affair without a clear radius to define its range. By the time their arrows pierce the skulls of half of your team, the realization that you needed to back up a bit will be too little too late. In StarCraft, the Protoss had pylons that were needed to be placed in proximity to structures. It was easy to do because during placement a circular indicator would appear and display the exact range of the pylon. Such is not the case here.  In typical Baldur's Gate fashion, orders can be sent down the line in stopped time. It'd be nice to bind the time function to the mouse wheel so that slowing or increasing the rate at which time passes could be right there (sometimes in the heavier fights later into the game managing many units can get troublesome). But pressing an extra three keys isn't much to gripe about.   The game is also pretty darn tough. If you think you have enough units to engage in battle, you most likely probably do not. The unit dependencies are a little unclear at first, but before too long you'll be mixing and matching and hoping the slower, weaker ones don't rush the line due to path finding issues fueled by a sometimes spotty AI (the kind that plagues literally every single other RTS I've ever played).   What makes it harder are the mission dependencies, specifically the critical hero units. Taking a developed one into battle hoping for an advantage and then losing him will spell instant defeat. Since retreat, as we touched on earlier, saps life out of your men quicker than the plague, extreme caution is advised.   As far as visuals go, it's obviously not Warcraft III, but easily on par with some of the better isometric non-polygonal ones around. I momentarily mistook a couple of arenas for actual photos or even polished renders. It helps that this beast can be displayed in 1600x1200 (don't unless you have some kind of enormous monitor). Trees and water shimmer, animals move around, thing smoke and smolder... Yup, Celtic Kings looks surprisingly lively for one of its type.   Again, detail to unobstructed play is present. Buildings that go transparent when units are around and things of that nature keep aesthetics from ever aggravating.   The 55 different units that populate the game exhibit a wide array of animations, but like many of the sort, are limited to eight-way movement and come with the poor animation transitions we've seen so many times before. When switching from one movement to another there is a discernible stutter, same when the animation routine ends and has to repeat itself.   What did you think of Celtic Kings?  Sound is perhaps the biggest downside to Celtic Kings. The looping score quickly tires and becomes repetitive, though it's a technically solid and familiar piece. Not all units in the game have voice acknowledgements and rightfully so, as some sound fairly atrocious. The standard text does a much nicer job of conveying it all, so not hearing the British or French accented blurbs actually comes in handy. When they are heard, it's generally out of place or kind off.   Of course, LAN and Internet play are in, as is the skirmish mode and randomly generated map feature (all standards that should be familiar to the RTS savvy). Topping off longevity is the full featured scenario/adventure editor. Play theirs then build your own. That's how it works.  Celtic Kings won't sell. I'm already envisioning it being shelved and disregarded by legions of Sims followers and those quick to bite in to the dynasty that Blizzard built. I'm clairvoyant -- a dreadfully accurate prophetic player, as it were.And it's really too bad, for this game is as deserving an RTS as any. Which is actually kind of the problem. It seems that it's becoming harder and harder for developers to make truly awful strategy products (though many still come, mind you). In turn, it's getting easier and easier for them, the development community, to crank out something of worth. How then can a good or great title compete against an excellent one, especially when hundreds are released regularly? It can't. That's why some sell and others move quickly to the bargain bin, perhaps later revived by necromantic magic and a critically acclaimed transmogrification (elaborate game of the year editions for games that no one buys).Celtic Kings doesn't deserve this fate. It's a very solid, polished, and playable title that pinches nearly perfect amounts from two staples of modern PC gaming and combines them into a lovely, warm broth. Its only problem is that the main course to this meal, served by someone else, is likely even better. So, minor faults become glaring and ever so slight hiccups suddenly turn debilitating. Perfect to try. Good to buy. If you have a thousand other RTS titles, this one is still sound, but not the pinnacle of achievement to drive them all into the ground.", "date": "Aug 27, 2002"}
