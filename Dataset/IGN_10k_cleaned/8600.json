Championship Edition isn't one of those forgettable 3D adventures. Nor is it yet another repackaging of the original mazes. It's an all new, bona fide 2D maze race complete with a few new gameplay twists that bring the franchise up to date with justice. Pac-Man really is back.   It's easy to see that Pac-Man: Championship Edition was designed with the Xbox Live Arcade in mind. It's been a long time since the quarter munching design of classic arcade games has felt compelling. Championship Edition is an arcade game for today's gamers. With a time limit of 5 or 10 minutes on each of the six modes, the game is less about survival and more about maximizing your score during that brief time period.    During those 5 or 10 minutes, the action never stops. The new twist on Pac-Man is a single stage that shifts and repopulates pellets as you clear them. Rather than having the entire maze filled with pellets and challenging the player to clear them all, this Pac-Man fills the maze with patterns of pellets. When you clear a half of the maze, a fruit appears on the other side. Eating it refills the side you cleared with a new pattern, sometimes changing the map itself. In this way, you can advance each individual half of the stage to new ~levels~ without ever having a break in the action. This left to right design works and it works well.     As the timer counts down, the action also speeds up. By the end of your run, Pac-Man and the ghosts are zipping around the maze at speeds that make quick reflexes more than just a bonus. They're required. The intense speed also plays into another twist on the classic Pac-Man design. Making it from one end of the maze to another doesn't take very long and you can easily eat a power pellet, gobble up all four ghosts, and then down another power pellet before the timer runs out. The scoring reflects this too, as the bonuses for eating successive ghosts goes up to 3200 points for eating 8 in a row instead of the standard four.    Championship Edition features six modes that each offer various quirks for the player to deal with. One puts Pac-Man in the dark and only reveals pellets, ghosts, and the Pac-Man's immediate surroundings. It's tough. Another speeds the game up to a breakneck pace and covers every wall with tunnels. It's also tough. Others have their own unique pacing, maze design and progression and they're all different enough from one another that a different style of play is necessary to maximize the high score on each.    Along with the new game design comes a new look. This is one of the few classic franchises that has been given a visual overhaul for the XBLA that actually looks good. The psychedelic, neon style stays true to the original feel of Pac-Man while still having a flair and appeal all its own. The same goes for the sound, though to a lesser extent. The sound effects are all nice resamplings of the originals, but the thumping techno music that drones in the background as you play will be hit or miss with most gamers.   Probably the biggest surprise with Championship Edition is how well the Xbox 360 controller works with it. We've leveled complaints at the d-pad and analog stick time after time for arcade style games, but the analog stick feels responsive and slick in Championship Edition. It isn't perfect and we did find ourselves missing turns occasionally, but it certainly feels a lot better than the original Pac-Man does with the Xbox Controller.    There are a few valid complaints that can be leveled at the Championship Edition. The first is the lack of multiplayer modes. While Pac-Man has traditionally been a solo game and the structure of the new gameplay doesn't mesh with the standard turn swapping between lives, the series isn't a stranger to multiplayer. It seems a bit strange to develop a game specifically for the XBLA and not include any online options.     When you finish each game, a nifty bar graph of your score break down by time is displayed so you can see a chart of when you scored the most points. It's cool, but it could have been even better. None of these stats are saved, so you can't ever compare your score breakdown against your all time bests. In fact, only your high score for each of the six modes is saved and used for the online leaderboards. No offline, individual leaderboards exist so you can't compare your score of the most recent game with anything other than your all time best.   The XBLA standard 200 achievement points are available with the download, but you won't find much trouble getting all of them. It took us roughly an hour and a half to have all 12. Even an entry level Pac-Man player should be able to get them all with a bit of practice. The achievements are primarily focused on lasting the full 5 or 10 minutes on each mode with a few tossed in that require a certain score or fruit to be eaten. There's a lot of room for more challenging achievements. Most people are familiar with how to play Pac-Man and don't need entry-level challenges to eat up such a large piece of the achievement pie. To be fair, Pac-Man has always been about getting a high score and the online leaderboards are more than enough of a challenge and will make achievements an afterthought for the hardcore.    The last, and probably most significant, issue is the price. Pac-Man: Championship edition will set you back 800 Microsoft Points ($10 USD) for the download. The six new modes are great for replaying over and over and the new look is attractive, but this is still Pac-Man we're talking about. If the game were 500 Microsoft Points, it would be a no brainer download. With the $10 price tag, Pac-Man fans will have shelled out $20 for the original Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man and now Championship Edition on XBLA.   After feeling the burn of paying a combined $10 for the original Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, you may be wary of a third Live Arcade Pac-Man game. Don't be. Unlike the other two, Championship Edition feels fresh and exciting. The classic feel of Pac-Man is still there, but the new features are well designed and fit in perfectly with the overall purpose of the Live Arcade. It's fast, exhilarating and fun. You can't go back to the original Pac-Man after playing this. $10 dollars seems a little bit pricy for a game that could use a couple more features, but if a few extra bucks won't break the bank then you'll find a nice little surprise in Pac-Man: Championship Edition.", "date": "Jun 6, 2007"}
