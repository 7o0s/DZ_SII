{"name": "Project: Horned Owl", "name_review": "Project: Horned Owl", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/26/project-horned-owl", "text": "Light-gun games are some of the most popular at the arcades, thanks to games like Area 51 and the Virtua Cop series. Unfortunately, the PlayStation's first foray into the light-gun arena has proven somewhat underwhelming.  Despite some great character design by Masamune Shirow, creator of anime hit Ghost In The Shell, Horned Owl comes up somewhat flat. A tracking camera guides you through a 3D environment, as enemies pop up from behind every conceivable hiding place. The gun (available separately from Konami) is accurate and easily calibrated, but the enemies, which are sprite based, don't allow for much variety. Everybody goes down the same, regardless of where they've been shot.  The missions are long, the backgrounds are interactive, and the enemies never stop coming. That's about all that can be said for Horned Owl, though. The anime-style is cool, but isn't enough to carry it.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
