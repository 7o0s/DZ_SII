What constitutes a game?  Is it a tight control system and an inventive, playful world?  Is it a battle system featuring weapon upgrades and experience?  How about a hand to hand combat system featuring reversals and crazy multi-hit combos?  Anyone who's grown into gaming exclusively through titles from Nintendo, Square, and Capcom are going to give Shenmue a try, and throw down their controllers in disgust, claiming it to be nothing more than flashy movie with little bits of interactivity here and there.  I'm a little different though, as are the many import gamers out there, who've been exposed to the likes of Policenauts, Snatcher, and any number of social simulator games, where communication, story, and exploration are the main forms of gameplay.  Yes, in a surprising twist, AM2's huge production falls into this latter category of games.  In fact, the largest complaints I have with the game are centered around the kinds of things you'd find in a movie review.  I have problems with the general stiffness of the main character, for instance.  No, I'm  not talking about his voice acting - all the parts in Shenmue are voiced perfectly - nor am I talking about his animation.  I'm specifically referring to the general actions of the main character as he interacts with many of the other characters.  I also have problems with how Ryo's relationship with Nozomi is very episode specific - there's only a special bond between the two when there's some scripted event going on.  Encounter Nozomoi among the other folks of Yokosuka, and their interaction will be basically the same as with everyone else.  What's this?  Comments about relationships in a video game review?  The thing you need to realize about Shenmue is that, since story and characters are so important to it, these are the kinds of issues that come up at the same level of gameplay issues.  There's no contrived gameplay system to be found anywhere in the game, actually.  It's a role playing game in the most valid sense of the word, with your taking control of Ryo Hazuki as he attempts to understand the meaning of his father's death from three days' prior.  Put yourself in Ryo's shoes for a second.  You've just seen your father die at the hands of a green-clad Chinese man.  The Chinese man, and his two black-clad henchmen, took off in a black car, headed down into the proper residential area of Yokosuka.  So what would you do in such a situation?  You'd go off in search of a black car, of course, asking townsfolk if they'd seen anything.  And in Shenmue, that's just how Ryo's adventures begin.  You lead Ryo, following a paper-trail of sorts throughout Yokosuka's residential and merchant areas, asking people what they saw on the day of your father's death.  One person says that so and so may have seen something, so you go find that person.  That person suggests that you do something else, so you follow up on that.  This is how the gameplay in Shenmue begins, with your exploring and becoming acquainted with your surroundings.  Eventually, your search will take you to the harbor of New Yokosuka and back, and you'll find yourself in a variety of extreme situations, but this exploration and paper-trail form of gaming is the mainstay and holds everything together.  I suppose you could call it a gameplay system, but it's nothing contrived, like a Materia system or a Mana-Egg system.  It's fully realistic, and I could easily imagine myself taking the same actions as Ryo, throughout (except for the fighting stuff - I have fists of oatmeal).  What keeps things interesting is exactly what keeps things interesting when watching a movie: the plot keeps on getting thicker and thicker as you uncover new details, and you anxiously await the next dramatic moment.  Although the game never reaches a climax due to this being the first chapter from a potentially long-running series, I couldn't stop playing; I had to force myself away from my Dreamcast, usually when the sun peeked out at the break of dawn.   This general form of gaming has been seen in various forms, and with just as compelling, if not more compelling stories.  But the twist in Shenmue is the way it's all presented to you.  Unlike the still frame adventures of the past, the world of Shenmue is fully navigatable in 3D.  You're given ample control over Ryo, and can make him move about the world at various speeds and look at any object with the tap of a button.  The control system is unobvious - it's like nothing you've ever seen before, and although it occasionally needs a feature that would allow you to lock your character into facing one direction while moving about, it overall works well.  Combine the solid controls with the best in-game camera work I've ever seen, where the camera tracks Ryo's movements perfectly, and you have what feels like a gameplay system that's been polished through extensive playtesting.  That's a good thing, as the Shenmue world is an interesting one.  It's as close to a virtual reality as I've yet seen, where people follow daily routines throughout the city, time passes throughout the course of the day, and seemingly random weather affects the environment.  Your character awakes every morning, at the game's outset, at 8:30, and you need to return home by 11:00PM (actually, you can stay out until 11:30, but do so and Ine, the Hazuki household caretaker, will scold you upon your return).  As you go out and about on your journeys, you'll witness the day gradually progress from day light, to evening, to night, and the effect is fully realized by the changing lighting on the environment.  The time is accelerated, with a few real world minutes corresponding to an hour of in-game time, and you can keep track of the time via an onscreen clock (if you pay attention, actually, you'll also see that the clocks in the Hazuki household are set properly, and advance with the day).   So does this dynamic world add to the gameplay?  The answer is a resounding yes.  Stores don't open until certain hours, and some close as early as 5:00PM.  If you need access to the interior of a particular store, in order to meet with a character or obtain some item, you'll have to accommodate to the game world, rather than the often used other way around.  If you want to meet certain characters, you'll also have to be at the right place at the right time.  One example comes to mind, involving a husband/wife pair who run a flower shop.  My observation has been that the husband runs the store from early morning until noon, and then the wife takes over for him.  It so happens that the wife holds a vital piece of information that will help you to advance.  You'll have to speak to her, and only her, in order to take a particular path through that section of the game, and if you aren't patient-enough to wait for her, you'll have to find some other path (there are actually three paths through that part of the game).  Of course, not everyone is going to wait for this lady - likewise for the dozens of other instances where you're required to make a decision of some sort.  Shenmue is definitely going to be played just a bit differently by everyone who makes the attempt, but that's only one of the advantages of the dynamic world.  I don't think I've ever played a game where time has come into play so dramatically, where you have to be in the right place in the right time for some event to occur, otherwise you'll find yourself on a different path. While there's certainly much potential for more use (the What's Shenmue demo actually used the time system better than anything I encountered in the game proper), as a pioneer in this area, the game comes off just fine.       In its effort to create this virtual world and achieve the utmost in reality, AM2 has taken things just a bit too far.  There are problems with the general slow pacing of the game, where you're forced to watch the same area of animation over and over again, without the ability to skip it.  When Ryo makes a phone call, you have to physically dial each number, one after the other - something that's certainly realistic, but god awful annoying (and these are 80's-style rotary phones, not the digital kind we all know and love).  Even worse is that, somewhere along the line, someone forgot to include an absolutely essential pass-the-time feature that would allow you to select an option to let your character skip a few hours in the game world.  This didn't once get in the way during my first run-through of the game, as I usually just passed the time in the arcade, but my second attempt has, thus far, been more of a chore than anything, as I constantly find myself letting the controller sit so that time can pass while I go do something else.  I'm certain that's not what AM2 intended.  They actually have a feature that allows you to instantly warp from your house to any section of the game (something that I'd suggest against using, seeing as how you may miss out on a randomly occuring event), so I'm hopeful that a pass-the-time feature will be included in the next chapter.  Then again, I understand AM2's position.  They've equipped the Shenmue world with so much to do and so much to see, that you may not find much use for a pass the time feature in the first place.  Beyond that, this is easily the most gorgeous world yet seen in a game.  If you've seen the classic digital comic Policenauts, you'll know how much detail Konami put into those still frames.  With Shenmue, the idea has advanced properly into the 3rd dimension.  You'll be amazed when you see the variety of objects, ranging from cassette tapes all the way to a giant bulldozer that never actually seems to move, but still adds to the environment.  It's the little things that have impressed me the most, though, like the reflections (go to the Asia Travel store to see the most minute detail imaginable - a girl's compact who's mirror actually reflects the surrounding environment), and the properly cast shadows.  Hmm . . . how about the candles in the Hazuki basement, which not only light up the environment, Code Veronica style, but actually melt with time?  Impressed?  These details, combined with a smooth framerate, high-quality character models (especially the faces on the main characters), and incredible animation for everything from Megumi's kitten to Shenhua's dress, will make you ignore with few deficiencies here and there.  Shenmue is the new graphics king for gaming.  Again, this area, which could have been used merely for presentation purposes, affects the game, greatly.  Navigation in Shenmue is done visually, entirely through landmark recognition.  It's how you remember the whereabouts of things in the real world, and the same holds true for Shenmue.  You identify store fronts and homes by the signs and placards on the outside.  In the harbor, the only way to keep yourself from getting hopelessly lost is to find an utterly confusing map on one of the building walls, or to navigate using the well-placed ground navigation information, which point out which buildings are in which direction.  I suppose one could say that this is a classic case of form following function - but form has never looked this good.       Graphics and environment aren't the only way Shenmue raises the bar in the digital comic/RPG genre through.  The game also features numerous action sequences that are encountered throughout your adventure.  All these sequences are played out not through menu commands, but in the most realistic sense imaginable, with your taking control of Ryo in real time - or some variant thereof.  And unlike other games involving action sequences apart from the main game, these take place (for the most part) in the same game world that you, as Ryo, adventure through.  I've made a little list of some of the things that you can do in the Shenmue world, and how successful I feel the group at AM2 has been at achieving their goals.  Free Battle: Ryo is trained in the Hazuki family martial arts, and you'll occasionally be attacked by thugs and various other villains.  You'll have to defeat them using an amazing fighting engine - dare I say the most impressive fighting engine outside of the big three of 3D fighters?  Ignoring the overly dramatic camera angels, which tend to make movement clumsy, the fighting system in Shenmue seems to be perfect for fighting hoards of incoming assailants.  You can punch, kick, defend, and use a skill, and in addition to a standard array of Virtua Fighter-style moves, you have access to a set of moves you learn throughout the adventure (see the next section for more details).  These moves can actually be leveled up by practicing them in the dojo, or in an abandoned parking lot in the game world.  This fighting system is a high point - and if you play towards the later areas of the game, you may get a glimpse into what Streets of Rage on the Dreamcast could look like.  The magic is that many of the attacks can strike multiple opponents.  You can grab one opponent and, while holding him, take out other opponents with kicks.  It's too bad, then, that the battle system isn't effectively used until later in the game.  In fact, you may have some difficulty in the third disk when the game throws free battle after free battle at you.  Hopefully, the next chapter will be more balanced in this area with a gradual buildup of difficulty. Learn Fighting Moves: Yet another way that Shenmue innovates, and something that we heard nothing about prior to the game's release.  Ryo is in a constant state of learning when it comes to his martial arts, and various characters in the game will teach him moves, explaining how a move is accomplished, but never stating the exact button combinations.  You have to watch their movements closely and try to mimic them.  If you see them move back, then you should move back.  If you see them execute a hand move of some sort, then maybe the punch button is in order.  All the while, the character is coaching you, making such statements as ~You don't have enough strength in your arms~ . . . or something like that.  It can be, often, difficult to mimic the moves, but when you do manage to get it right, it's a rewarding feeling.  And if you can't get it right, the game will allow you to proceed on without asking any questions.  The designers of Shenmue clearly have a love of fighting as an artform, and they way the characters who train Ryo describe their fighting - well, it makes me guilty for having never tained myself in the martial arts. Quick Timer Events: There are many scripted events in Shenmue, where Ryo engages with other characters.  AM2 has made these sequences loosely interactive, with your being required to press a button at a given time, else go down some unwanted path.  The Quick Timer Events start off short and are used sparsely, but when you get to the third disk, you'll be in quick timer heaven with some of the most awesome sequences you've ever seen, either in film, or in a game.  Forget about the complaints people initially had for this system - it's a welcome addition, and adds a lot to the game.  So much so, in fact, that I wish AM2 had used it for more of the events.     Raise a Virtual Pet: You get the opportunity to raise a cute little kitty cat (I named my cat ~Mimi,~ by the way).  If you follow the path that takes this injured kitty to prime physical health, you'll have to purchase food from the local 24-hour Tomato Mart and feed it daily.  I enjoyed it, but others will probably ignore it. Play Electronic Games: You can go into Yokosuka's game center and try your hand at classic Sega games such as Hang On and Space Harrier, as well as a few newbies such as darts and a Quick Timer Event boxing game.  You'll even find a pool game in MJQ Bar, although I couldn't really get into it (well then, Mr. Anoop, you shouldn't be reviewing this game!!!).  All of these games are excellent distractions - especially Hang On, which is quite the addictive title. Ride a motorcycle: For various reasons, you'll at some point need to ride a motorcycle.  You speed through the highways on the outskirts of Yokosuka, controlling the motorcycle as you would in an actual motorcycle game.  It looks amazing, and although short, is a blast to play - and it, strangely, fits more snuggly into the game than the motorcycle sequence in Final Fantasy VII did.  Hmm . . . oddly enough, I enjoy the Hang On arcade game more than this. Drive a Fork Lift: For various reasons, you'll at some point obtain a job as a fork lift driver.  I don't want to reveal too much about this part of the game, as it was quite a surprise to me, but you actually control the fork lift as you work throughout the day, and it's tremendous fun.  These sequences, more than anything, point to how versatile the Shenmue engine is - that it can handle movement at probably three times the speed of Ryo's running is a testament to the genius of AM2's programmers (wait until you see the lengthy list of programming talent in the credits).    I'm certain I've forgotten a few things in there, but you should generally get the idea.  Through these mini games, and the full-on adventure portion, Shenmue's gaming experience puts you in full control of Ryo, to probably the greatest extent possible.  Aside from interactive conversations, I couldn't ask for anything more.      Actually, scratch that.  I could ask for something more . . . a lot more.  This first chapter of Shenmue ends like Empire Strikes Back, with a moderate resolution, but a larger problem still looming.  I want, now more than any other game (yes, even Sakura Wars III and Grandia II) the next chapter in the Shenmue saga.  I want to see what happens next, and I want to experience the same mix of exploration, conversation, and adventure found in this game.  Part 2, which should pick up where part 1 left off and lead us on Ryo's further adventures, is already set to hit Japan in the foreseeable future.  Hopefully I won't have to wait too long.  -- Anoop Gantayat, who wrote the Shenmue review while listening to the Shenmue Orchestral Soundtrack  NOTE TO THOSE WHO'VE IMPORTED THIS GAME: Our preview of Shenmue contains information on the character backgrounds, voice actors, and gameplay systems, along with more movies and images, as well as a beginner's guide.
