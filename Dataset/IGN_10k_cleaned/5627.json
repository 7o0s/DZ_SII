Musashi: Mobile Samurai might not be the deepest game for your new 3D handset, but it's certainly one of the flashiest -- so if you ever wanted a game that make your friends gnash their molars in green envy, make this your next download. Of course, it doesn't hurt that there's an amusing game behind the pretty polygons when you are without an audience to awe.   Musashi: Mobile Samurai stars the hero of the Brave Fencer franchise, an unlikely little hero that has endeared himself to fans since the original Musashi game launched on the PSone. Musashi: Mobile Samurai, however, does not play out like that adventure, nor the recently released PlayStation 2 game that this wireless edition is perfectly timed to coincide with.   Musashi: Mobile Samurai is more of a simplistic fighting game, thrusting the hero in a tower full of monsters. Your goal is to help the brave little fencer reach the top floor by slashing down said monsters. While we are a little disappointed that the select few monster models are reused so many times, it is very cool that they are directly tied into the console release.   At the beginning of each round, Musashi squares off with an enemy. Pressing ~OK~ unleashes a basic sword attack. You can press up to block when you spy your foe getting ready to strike, but often times there is a better strategy than just going for the quick block. Pressing to the side at just the right moment makes the fencer dodge the blow and skirt behind the enemy. Attack now and you can unleash a minor combo on the monster's exposed hindquarters for boffo damage.   The problem is, once you master the system of balancing these special attacks, basic attacks, and simple blocks, the game isn't terribly challenging. The length of the game comes more from the sheer amount of bad guys, including some boss battles, than epic fights. However, Musashi: Mobile Samurai does break the fights down into easy play sessions, making the game an ideal time-killer for between-class swordfights. And it can even be argued that the simplified controls actually make the game more accessible to a wider range of players, not just fighting game fans.   Musashi: Mobile Samurai is an extremely attractive mobile game. The character models are extremely well done. Musashi looks like a true-blue anime hero with oversized hair and the kind of costume that one the art department at Square can design. (That's a compliment, by the way.) The texture work is very well done, not the least bit muddy, unlike a few initial VCAST offerings. The arenas are bright and colorful, and thanks to a smooth, smart camera system (whoever programmed that deserves a raise) you can see all of it without much of a frame hiccup. Very nice stuff.   The game also sounds exceptional with a little jingle that never grates as well as some expertly sample sword clashing noises. On our VX8000, the game was actually kinda loud, so you may wish to adjust the volume when playing in mixed company.  If you're an early VCAST adopter like I was, I feel your pain. Thankfully, Square Enix Mobile did, too, and had released a 3D game actually worth outright purchasing rather than going for the subscription model. While Musashi: Mobile Samurai is not especially deep or challenging, it does prove a few hours of fun which, when spread out over several weeks, is worth your money. And if you're one of those people that love playing the cellphone one-upmanship game, this is the perfect game to download. In an era now where cellphones are an extension of self (which is kind of sad when you think about it), Musashi: Mobile Samurai definitely says your phone has arrived.", "date": "Mar 24, 2005"}
