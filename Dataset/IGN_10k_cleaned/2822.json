And while many players will see that as a negative, all I can say is any game that causes a huge crowd of jaded IGN hacks to gather around a single TV screen and scream and shout at one another like MMV3 does has got to have something special about it. What is it? Competitive gameplay, that's what.   Racing is ever so simple. The player chooses a Micro Machine -- which range from racing cars and offroad trucks to big rigs (or should that be little rigs) and ice cream trucks -- and races it over a series of weird and wonderful, differently-themed courses. A breakfast table mightn't sound like a thrilling place to race, but when you're a piddly-ass Micro Machine, all of a sudden spilled milk becomes a lake, splotches of syrup become deadly sticky pools and spoons, bowls and bottles become building-sized obstacles. Another course is set on a series of school desks. Pencils, erasers and books form impassable obstacles, and the rulers connecting the desks form thin, perilous roads whose lack of guard rails means a deadly fall is only a spaz twitch away.   Unlike most games of this ilk, races can be won long before the finish post is reached. There are eight lights at the side of the screen. At the start of a race, four are lit in the player's colors, and four are lit in the opponent's colors. Every time the player gets a screen length ahead of the opponent (or the opponent falls off or strays too far from the track), the race briefly pauses and one of the opponent's lights goes out and is lit in the player's color. Then both cars are realigned together on the track and the race resumes. If all lights are lit in the player's colors, the race is won. Should the race finish before one of the contestants has lit all the lights, the person with the most lit lights wins (with a sudden death playoff in the event of a tie).   Again, this doesn't sound particularly exciting, but all I can say is play it. Micro Machines V3 is the ultimate party game. It's fast, it's furious and its gameplay is absolutely brilliant. Because it's so simple, anyone can get into it after a couple of minutes and the gameplay is beautifully balanced to be ultra-competitive.   Backing all this up is a wide variety of play modes, including an insane simultaneous eight-player mode with pairs of players sharing joypads (hilarious fun!), all sorts of championship and time trial modes and a fully-comprehensive single-player mode that has lots of really cool prize cars to win. And I love the fact that you and a friend can get together and compete to win prize cars from one another -- I'm sure that's going to cause some major arguments!   MMV3 is truly fabulous. Most players will pass it by because it just doesn't look that great and -- let's face it -- the premise of racing little toy cars around a breakfast table just doesn't sound as exciting as something as WipeOut XL or F1. But those buy this will be rewarded with one of the most fun and addictive multiplayer games yet seen on PSX.  Jaz Rignall", "date": "Jan 10, 1998"}
