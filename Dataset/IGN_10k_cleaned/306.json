First it was the PlayStation a couple years ago...and now, it's the Game Boy Color's turn to get a boring, redundant, formulaic platform game based on the comic book license. Aren't you glad you waited for this? Features Seven levels Nine characters Only for Game Boy Color  When you start the game, you're offered a screen that lets you enter four levels of the game. Three levels are simply a generic platform game where you control Spawn through alleyways and such, hoping over walls, punching bad guys and picking up the occasional weapon. When you get to the end of the level, you'll go into more generic, redundant platform hopping, until you reach the level boss.  And the level bosses are unbelievably boring and easy to defeat. Just jump over them when they attack, kick 'em, jump over them again, kick 'em, and repeat until he's dead.  The other type of game is a sidescrolling driving game where you're on the back of a motorcycle, kicking other motorcyclists and grabbing a weapon to shoot enemy vehicles. This is pretty fun...for about five minutes. Then, you realize that's all the level is, and nothing's going to change. Sure, it looks pretty, with the scenery buzzing by at a speedy rate. But it gets monotonous very quickly, and you'll just want it to end.  In both types of levels, you can hold the attack button down and unleash your chain weapon from your chest, having it whip out at the closest enemy. Other than this little feature, there's nothing here that hasn't been done before, and hasn't been done better.   Between levels, you're treated to colorful cutscenes, complete with digitized speech. This is icing for an otherwise substandard Game Boy Color title. And even though it's nice to see polish like this, it does nothing for the actual game. I thought we left generic platform games to rest back in the NES days  Spawn proves that theory wrong. Apparently there are developers out there who lack any imagination for Game Boy Color game design, and they were thrown upon the Spawn project for Konami. Unless you're a die-hard Spawn fanatic, you should leave this title to rot on store shelves.", "date": "Oct 13, 1999"}
