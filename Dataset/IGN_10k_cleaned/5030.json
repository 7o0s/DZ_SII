He's even copied all of his exploits from party games to kart racing. Crash Nitro Kart, released last fall to little acclaim, was stillborn on consoles. Can Digital Bridges' mobile take of the kart racer swerve around it's absolute unessential big brother?   Features:   Four characters: Crash, Crunch, Coco, Neo-Cortex  Multiple power-ups  Quick play and Tournament Modes   Nokia released a pretty solid version of Crash Nitro Kart for the N-Gage a few months ago. What was a mere trifle on consoles actually played pretty well on the N-Gage, especially without any other kart racers to compete with. Unfortunately, Crash Nitro Kart for cellphones is a very different animal.   A stinky, run-over, dead animal.   Crash Nitro Kart has a myriad of small problems, but what really kills the game is that it's just not much fun. Kart racers are supposed to the fast and furious, and today's handsets just cannot produce that. Control is sluggish and sense of speed is null, so really, why bother?   Crash Nitro Kart stars four characters from the Crash universe: Crash, Coco, Crunch, and Neo Cortex. Each racer has their own set of strengths and weaknesses based on top speed, acceleration, and cornering. Honestly, even though the game does control poorly, we were able to tell that these affected the game. For example, high-rated Crash does corner better than Coco.   There are several tracks to race in the Tournament Mode, across three environments: Beach, City, and Castle. The tracks themselves aren't terribly different, but the background images do change. As you get further into the tourney, tracks start having more sharp turns and the occasional little jump. But other than these slight switcheroos, this is really just an exercise in moving your thumb left and right.   Crash Nitro Kart does employ power-ups that affect the race. When you drive over boxes, you receive power-ups like invincibility and TNT boxes. With invincibility, you can run into another racer to send them spinning out. TNT, on the other hand, is supposed to blow up somebody behind you -- but you'll just have to trust the game on that.   As mentioned, the control is lacking. Pressing up on the pad accelerates, but you never know when you are a max velocity. The only meter on the screen is a line along the top that shows your position relative to the closest racer. Turning is slow and easy, even on sharp turns. Rarely did we run off the track.   Also discouraging is the cheap AI. In more than one race, we pulled away from the pack early on -- and stayed there for all three laps -- only to be hit with a projectile on the final stretch. With zero chance to recover, we went from first the fourth. What kind of reward is that? That's just tacky. And lame. And cheap.   Crash Nitro Kart looks merely decent. The little racer sprites are somewhat detailed -- you always know who's behind the wheel. The backdrop pictures change, not unlike the backdrops of, say, Space Harrier. There is a little music at the beginning of the game, and then some mild sound effects during the race.Boring. Crash Nitro Kart is just boring. We'd go so far as to say it's easy, too, but then there's that matter of being thwarted just meters in front of the finish line by cheap tactics. If you're looking for a racing game for your handset, consider other options, such as FOX Sports Racing and OutRun. This bandicoot crashed, alright.", "date": "Sep 25, 2004"}
