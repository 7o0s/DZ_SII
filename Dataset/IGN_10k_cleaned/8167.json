Developer Capcom did a marvelous job creating a truly charming action-platformer that is still playable a decade and a half later. I played this game quite a bit when I was a kid and even though I found myself often frustrated, I still kept coming back for more.   Players reprise the role of Sir Arthur, who sets out on a daring journey through the dwellings of the undead, in hopes of rescuing the princess before it's too late.  That's pretty much as far as the story develops, but this hardly detracts from the overall experience. I mean, who really needs a deep storyline when you're scorching zombies with torches or impaling Cujo-like canines with giant sabers?   The action is fast and furious, and if you hesitate for even one second, you might just find yourself in your undies, or worse - as a pile of broken bones.  No, seriously -- Sir Arthur begins with a suit of armor, but once an enemy touches him, he is hit by a projectile, or falls in a trap, the armor is shattered, leaving Arthur in his drawers.  It's a pretty comical scene, and is still funny after all these years.   As Sir Arthur treks through eerie graveyards, sinking pirate ships, and dark caverns, a multitude of weaponry is at his disposal in that he may swiftly dispatch every enemy in sight.  There are also two pieces of more powerful armor that not only offer Arthur a bit of protection, but they can upgrade his weapons.  The second suit of armor even has the ability to charge a powerful magical attack.  The arsenal, which can be found in randomly materializing treasure chests throughout the levels, consist of daggers which can be fired rapidly, a bow and arrow that fires two arrows at a time, a flaming torch that ignites the ground, a lance, miniature scythe, throwing axe and more.  Each weapon has an upgrade, such as heat-seeking arrows or flaming swords, which more easily slaughter the enemy.   The game is very fun, albeit somewhat frustrating at times.  Ghouls, ghosts and other baddies will materialize at random as Arthur stomps through the levels, and there can often be up to seven enemies on the screen at one time.  Not only does this create a challenge for the player, but it also unfortunately causes a great deal of slowdown.  This adversely affects the playability of the game as it can be hard to maneuver Arthur when the framerate drops so significantly. It is especially disappointing since this drawback could have been corrected with minimal development time; after all, Wii is much more powerful than S-NES.   Controlling Arthur is a mixed bag.  Unlike Mario, the hero cannot increase or decrease his momentum whilst in the air.  This means that once you commit him to jumping, there's no turning back.  This can be very frustrating, as enemies might materialize the second after you've jumped, and you may land right on them.  However, Arthur does possess the ability to double jump, and if the player chooses, the second jump can be in the opposite direction.   The backgrounds and dynamic levels are quite a treat, as is the soundtrack, with catchy spooky tunes, and appropriate sound effects in accompaniment.  The boss battles are tough but satisfying, and even though games have evolved quite a bit since the game's inception, it's still a great deal of fun.  16 years after its initial debut on the Super Nintendo, Super Ghouls N Ghosts holds up surprisingly well even with more complex platformers emerging thereafter.  Maybe Ive lost my touch, or my fingers are far chubbier than they used to be, but I found the game to be pretty darn tough on my first run through (it took me an hour to pass the first level).  Fans of the series will find that everything is perfectly intact, and is as much fun now as it ever was.  If you enjoy platformers and are looking for a good ol fashioned challenge, drop the 800 Wii points on the shopping channel, and start slaying the undead.", "date": "Mar 6, 2007"}
