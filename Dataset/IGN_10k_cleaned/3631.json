By swiping in data striped imprinted on five trading cards, players can load in near perfect emulations of the same NES games players were plopping into their systems almost 20 years ago. One of the games Nintendo released is Clu Clu Land one of three NES games in the Series 3 set of NES cards. Clu Clu Land is a very strange and quirky action maze game where players assume the role of a fish-like thing, wandering a maze uncovering gold bars hidden between the game grid. Players must maneuver this maze, avoiding enemies that are out to get you...by zapping them with a wave of energy, you can push them off the map and wipe them out of the game for a little while. The game's controls are equally weird, as players have to work with the character's ability of ~latching~ onto posts to turn clockwise or counter-clockwise in order to pass through the gaps. When all the bars have been uncovered on the game grid, they're supposed to form a ~picture~ of sorts...like a heart or an airplane. Then it's onto the next, much harder challenge. It's kind of like Pac-Man in reverse...but even that's not an accurate way to describe the action. It's just ~different.~  I honestly don't remember seeing this game on shelves during the early part of the Nintendo Entertainment System's life. The concept is very old-school arcade, but it just doesn't have the elements to make it a ~classic.~ It's certainly challenging, though, and if you want something that'll tax your brain and your gaming thumbs, this one's just five bucks to try it out.", "date": "May 2, 2003"}
