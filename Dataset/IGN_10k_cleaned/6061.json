{"name": "Myst V: End of Ages", "name_review": "Myst V: End of Ages", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/22/myst-v-end-of-ages", "text": "In the Beginning  Myst can be described as one of the last genuine ~adventure~ series on the market. While far from perfect, every successive title in the franchise has advanced the genre in some way or another. Every title has offered outstanding visuals at the time of release, not to mention continuously evolving puzzle design. But it wasn't so much the puzzles or graphics that made the Myst series unique, but its reliance on story. There are plenty games out there with decent puzzles, but those aren't adventure games; they're puzzle games. For the most part, puzzles have always propelled the story in Myst. At the very least puzzles seemed relevant to the gameworld.    And now, after 12 years of adventuring, game developer Cyan Worlds, creator of the original Myst, has decided the time has come to end the series. And what better way to end one of the most prolific franchises in videogame history than to release a climactic chapter. Myst V: End of Ages sets out to complete the narrative started back in 1993 with the original Myst. It reintroduces characters and plotlines with the intent of ending things with gusto. And that's a very good thing since adventure fans can't live with loose ties. They need a sense of closure.     Rest assured, the last and final chapter of the Myst saga provides closure for those who can't live without it. And for those just looking for a great adventure game, well, it delivers in that regard as well. Gamers familiar with the Myst universe, either through the games or novels, will undoubtedly receive more fulfillment than those new to the series. Still, End of Ages does a better job summarizing characters, narrative and crucial plot points than its predecessors.     For those who may not know, End of Ages takes place in the primary Myst universe and not in a tangent dimension or timeline like Uru: Ages Beyond Myst. Players familiar with any of the previous Myst games will find End of Ages draws heavily on the narrative in every Myst title. It borrows more from certain chapters than others, but those with extensive knowledge of the series will find a lot to like (and remember) playing through End of Ages. It does a fine job reiterating important plot points without getting tedious, so those new to the series won't feel lost, confused or otherwise shafted.       Tell Me a Story  The story in End of Ages feels a bit more personal than in previous chapters, mainly due to a greater sense of player participation. Usually, narrative in Myst is linear and non-interactive, with player action having little effect on the outcome of the story. While End of Ages takes a similar approach, there's a greater sense of involvement due to the nature of the story. End of Ages is all about choices. Players explore the game knowing they'll have a very important decision to make at the end; a decision that seals the fate of the D'ni civilization. This does more than end the series on a personal note; it adds another layer of immersion to an already immersive experience.     The two main characters in the game, an elderly man named Escher and Yeesha, daughter of Atreus, add yet another layer of player interaction to End of Ages. While players can't talk to them directly, these 3D rendered characters wind up feeling more genuine and real than the FMV actors of previous Myst games. And it's not the fact these characters look so good, though they do. They're masterfully animated, in fact. It's actually the way each character speaks with genuine conviction. The voice acting here rocks and really helps make End of Ages one of the most involved, story-heavy titles in the Myst saga.    As players make their way through the game, Escher appears and reappears, offering hints, guidance and informative tidbits that all Myst fans should find intriguing. Players experience the game as a faceless avatar, sure, but this helps make the game feel personal. Almost as though there's a real journey in need of undertaking. A journey with perils and real consequence. There's also great sense of accomplishment with each mystery solved and with every puzzle conquered. And since Escher has gone through the same quest that players will experience, his stories and feedback are not only entertaining, but insightful and helpful as well.      But How Does it Play?  And some folks will definitely need the help. While puzzles aren't nearly as difficult as those in Myst II: Riven, a few can still set the mind ablaze with hell fire. Puzzle selection in End of Ages feels like a cross section of previous Myst games. It includes the sublimely logical puzzles from Uru as well as the simplified mechanical puzzles of Myst III: Exile. And yes, there's even a few brain imploding puzzles like those from Myst II. Fans should have little complaints, though, since it's always better to represent all sections of the gaming populace than just one.     Unlike previous Myst titles, End of Ages revolves around a series of stone tablets. At the beginning of the game, Yeesha talks about four tablets scattered throughout four different ages. When combined, these tablets hold the power to release a fifth tablet. It's this final tablet that players will spend hours trying to get. Of course, doing so requires the use of the other four, less important tablets. Virtually every puzzle in the game exploits these tablets in one way or another, so there's a whole new dynamic to End of Ages that simply wasn't there in previous installments. Players actually carry the tablets with them while exploring the game's different ages. The tablet takes up a chunk of the lower left hand side of the screen when not in use, though players can bring it up when they need to use it.    And boy, does End of Ages use these tablets a lot. Instead of simply manipulating the environment, pulling levers and flipping switches, etc, players need to find ways to alter the gameworld by drawing symbols on the tablets. Going into detail on how this works would spoil a substantial chunk of the fun. Suffice to say this new system works beautifully and adds a good deal of depth to the established Myst formula. More importantly, it's a lot of fun. Players will alter the weather, command beasts and even break through walls by sketching specific symbols. Gaining access to those hard-to-reach places often lies in the power of the tablets, too, so they're practically the main device driving the entire experience.     When it comes to controls, End of Ages lets players modify the control scheme to suit individual preferences. Longtime fans of the series will remember the static click-a-thon that was Myst, Myst II: Riven and Myst III: Exile. Myst V offers three different control schemes, including: Classic Mouse-Click, Classic Plus and Free-Move. Together, these options let you play like it's 1993 or 2003, or somewhere in between. It all depends on what you like. Certain folks will like the first-person shooter feel of Free-Move while others (most likely the Myst hardcore) will opt for Classic Mouse-Click or Classic Plus.    But is It Pretty?  And now a word about graphics. For those who remember, Uru: Ages Beyond Myst offered an almost overwhelming sense of atmosphere. The music, too, was just as good as the marvelous visuals. So it came as a surprise (a letdown, really) when Myst IV reverted to the traditional static environments of earlier Myst installments. The game still looked fantastic, but it marked the first and only time the series actually took a step backward. The decision made the game run better on older machines, but that's no excuse. Not that Revelation was a bad game, far from it. Game engine aside, Revelation offered a slew of clever puzzles and hours of compelling narrative.     End of Ages embraces the 3D engine introduced in Uru. And it's the better game for it. The visuals here look downright incredible. The level of detail in the environments, not to mention the various contraptions and creatures is quiet impressive. And that's not including the various structures found throughout the game's four ages. Each age has its own theme and each has a variety of weather conditions. And each looks great.    Myst V: End of Ages does a fine job of ending the series. It's a good enough game to stand on its own, but longtime fans owe it to themselves to see how things turn out. Every change to the Myst formula, from the tablets to the varied control schemes, make End of Ages one of the best entries in the series. And the visuals and sound rank among the series' best as well. Highly recommended to Myst fans and plain adventure fans alike.", "date": "Sep 22, 2005"}
