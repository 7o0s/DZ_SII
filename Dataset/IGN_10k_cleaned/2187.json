No longer because of my fear of death, but because of my fear that I might become far less intelligent than I am right now. This stems from my recent experience with Real War. Apparently units in a real war are reduced to the intelligence of playful monkeys. But this game was supposed to be based on the official Joint Chiefs of Staff training title for the U.S. military... How could that be wrong? I'd fear for our safety if this sorry bunch of bumbling idiots was actually running the show. Luckily for us, our real military, the one that actually conducts real wars, are incredibly capable and thankfully haven't been studying this game for practice, at all.  Let's just have it out right off the bat, because I don't really want to spend a whole lot of time mucking around, this is one of the worst RTSs I've played in quite a while. No imagination, no strategy, no looks or style, a sometimes bumbling control scheme, and worst of all, AI not worthy of being spat on. It's amazing to me that they let this out the door in the shape that it's in. We actually had some hopes for this one from some of the demos we were given, but after getting a chance to sit down with this awful game, I can only come to one conclusion: my time spent in a lock box full of nut nibbling rabid squirrels was more fun than my experience with this game.  During the course of the game, you'll get to fight as the US or the ILA terrorist group. From what I've seen in the game, this is the best armed terrorist force in the freaking world... Ever. They have what seems to be an inexhaustible supply of tanks and helicopters and subs and carriers and planes.... Anyway, you get to take them out as the U.S. or jump into their slimy shoes to fight over 24 missions and multiplayer action across several different locations.  So here's the short rant, because I canst holds it no longa.' AI. That's where RTSs should be spending their time and money at this point. Good graphics are great and so is good sound, but when it comes down to it, the strategic and tactical challenges that you face in these titles are what make them the most fun. So when the AI is about as intelligent as the Three Stooges on a bad day, there's bound to be some major problems.  Let's concentrate on the ground troops here because they're the most troublesome of the bunch and really give the greatest examples of ineptitude: pathfinding. It's a good thing. Why they decided not to include it is beyond me. Units get stuck on corners of land, can't find their way to their designated move point, and generally have an incredibly hard time navigating around one another. Forget about moving around in any sort of an organized fashion because once the move issue is ordered, chaos always closely follows. Units will bump into one another and turn around to run the other direction for half a minute before turning and coming back only to try the exact same path once again. They start driving in circles for no apparent reason, and generally don't follow orders. They even do this after being selected by dragging a box around a few units while they're still. They just start moving around for no reason! What's that about? I didn't tell them to move, all I did was say ~Hey there guys, listen up.~ And their response was not exactly what I was looking for.  So now that we know the pathfinding AI is bad, how about the combat AI? Somehow they've managed to make this even worse, which is really amazing considering that it's supposed to be what the Joint Chiefs' training game uses. Both the enemy and friendly AI are like watching tennis players on horse tranquilizers. The enemy, on most occasions, has the initiative to go directly for certain areas of the camp, like the power generators. So they disregard my line of twenty tanks (a couple of which are sober enough to fire at the incoming troops, though not usually sober enough to hit them), and roll right into base and begin firing on my buildings. My troops then pick their butts for a minute and play a little game of Pinka Blinka to decide who'll go after the invading troops. At this point a couple of my units will begin to chase down the offending marauder. Naturally one of them will get stuck on a building right off the bat and then the other will eventually make its way to the enemy and open fire, only to be blown to bits by friendly fire from units I've forced to chase after the invaders. Meanwhile, a constant stream of enemies with tunnel vision file into my base causing all kinds of havoc. They don't really destroy anything, but make it so that I have to constantly order troops around and repair buildings that have been damaged (which is an annoying task unto itself by the way). What is this ~tactics~ you speak of?  You can build any number of ~real war~ units to be frustrated with, such as these wondrous machines known only as ~tanks,~ flying machines called ~bombers~ and ~attack helicopters,~ and even the highly classified ~stealth fighter.~ If this is real war, put some names behind it. When you give a game a name like that touting it's a realistic war game, you've got to have the details. What kind of tanks are they, what kind of planes... something, anything. And at least try to distinguish them as unique. Everything looks the same. Even enemy units are almost the exact same color as your own so it's hard to distinguish who you should be firing at.  While the game isn't downright ugly, it's pretty close to it. Units are blandly realized with monotonous color schemes and little to no animation attached to their less than brilliant models. Sure, it's a war game, it doesn't need to be pretty, it just needs to have good gameplay. That's mostly true, but when the gameplay is crappy enough, you have to try to look for other ways of enjoyment. The fact is, the looks of the game just accentuate the manic switching between rampant boredom and frustration. Buildings are barely detailed by today's RTS standards, textures for both vehicles and terrain are about as detailed and exciting as Ishtar, weapons effects are close to non-existent (except for missiles and rockets which have smoke trails), and explosions are forgettable.   Even without the crappy AI and boring looks, the rest of the game is mired in gameplay elements that are old and stale mixed together with new ones that weren't thoroughly thought out. Take the resourcing for instance. You build supply depots and helicopters, then boats and planes come in to drop of supplies which can be used to make new units and buildings. It's different so that's a good thing right? No. It's boring and slow and adds close to nothing to the game. There's no fighting over resource patches (which is part of the fun of the games with resource management). It's also inexhaustible so if some of your units do get destroyed, there's no real challenge in creating new ones, making your units entirely expendable. I'm not sure, but that doesn't really sound like real war to me.   And all of this is without even commenting on the various random crashes that occur throughout. The game dropped to the desktop on several occasions, none of which seemed to be caused by the same thing. Then there's the lame mission design that sometimes ends with having to destroy all units and buildings where that buildings are scattered all over the damn place so that you have to order your troops to the wind to find everything.  This game is bad. In almost every way this game is bad. I'd love to say that it's not true, but it is. I'll say it once again to get my point clearly across. This game is one of the worst RTSs I've played in quite a while. There are so many better options out there, especially for the 45 bucks you'll be shelling out to claim a copy. I was really hoping that this was going to be a good strategy title with real units and realistic situations and tactics, but it's not. I'm wondering whether being forced to fight in a real war wouldn't have been more enjoyable than this.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
