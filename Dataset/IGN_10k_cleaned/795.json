Many games, particularly sports and racing, end up as wastes of plastic when they try to strike a balance between arcade and simulation. Getting good believable physics into a fun and nutty environment is extremely difficult, especially when you're talking about a sport that appeals to the Cadillac and caviar set. Somehow, Saffire has combined good golf and good fun in a seamless package that challenges the mighty Hot Shots-based Mario Golf from Nintendo.  Features  Action-oriented gameplay.

EA motion-captured Tiger Woods' million-dollar swing and signature on-the-course reactions. Rumble Pak and Controller Pak compatible.   Gameplay All of the fun of CyberTiger comes from the cool golf swing control system. Pulling back and then forward on the analog stick with all of the necessary precision of a real golf swing is a great idea. It really made us wonder why it hadn't been done sooner considering Nintendo's innovative analog stick has been with us from the beginning, unlike some other systems. This is better than the multiple button tapping system as you try to get the cursor in the proper power and accuracy zones because you end up recreating the tension and concentration found on an actual golf course. N64 owners are use to sensitive analog stick manipulation so it's a stroke of brilliance that Cyber Tiger relies on this.  All of the game modes can really eat into your dedicated videogaming hours. Golf is a long game and it's accurately depicted here. Stroke Play, the Skins GameMatch Play and Tournament modes require consistent play and focus to get through. There are a couple of exceptions, however.   The two player Battle Mode is another great idea Saffire has thrown in that just seems so obvious when you think about what can be done in a golf videogame. Two players are on opposite sides of a lava river and the task is to destroy the platform that the other guy is standing on with a well placed explosive golf shot. The cool part is that it's in real time so you can just fire at will and there's no aiming involved. All you have to do is put the right amount of power on the shot so that you don't come up short or over shoot your target. Once you get the hang of it and realize there's plenty of skill involved, the explosions and trash talking possibilities are many and varied. This provides such great multiplayer gaming that we wish it was available for four players.     The controls can actually be a little complicated at first, especially for those unfamiliar with the world of golf. Besides the analog stick swing control, however, there's nothing about CyberTiger's control that can't be mastered by those who've played Mario Golf.  The power-ups go along way towards bringing out the arcade fun in CyberTiger. It's  not just what the power-ups do for your game, but it's the clever little golf ball mid-flight transformations that will bring a smile to your face. The Skipper  power-up for example allows your shot to skip across water and continue on to precious dry land and it turns into a nice flat spinning rock as it does so. Enough to make any tomboy proud.  The Distance power-up turns your golf ball into a rocket as soon as you knock into the air and will have your wishing you could take it to a real course with you as you stick 400 yard drives off the tee.  The power-ups can be incorporated into your strategy as well. Why even bother aiming to the left of that lake when you can just use a Skipper, aim right for the middle of that sucker and gain an extra 40 or 50 yards? No need to play it safe, when you can just reach the green in one stroke on a Par 4.  Sound The sound effects work well with the arcade elements of the game and we love the sound clips but the music could've used more work.   It's the little details that bring home the arcade experience and the sound of Cyber Tiger get the job done. Splashing golf balls and rocket engine sounds as your shot takes off into the stratosphere aren't much but you'd darn sure notice if they weren't there. Little bird sounds when you sink one and music stings when you earn a new power-up are fine little audio rewards for a job well done.  Never mind the motion captured Tiger, your favorite golfer even talks a little trash in this game. Sinking shots gets you little comments like ~sweet shot~ and we've got to admit it sounds like Tiger himself. If you take too long setting up your shot, Tiger will look at you and give you a piece of his mind and it all sounds pretty good.   The music however tries to be a subtle as it can, but the short diddy gets very annoying after the 100th time. And you'll still be on the first hole by that time. Simply put, the background music sounds like an intro or breakdown to a pop song that never ends. You're waiting for the artist to come back in with the next verse but it never happens. BGM volume control is under the main options menu.   Graphics The players look good and move well but it's golf so we expect that from this kind of game that has very little action to keep track of. The motion capture is especially well done however and deserves a little attention.  Tiger's swing has been so accurately reproduced here, that you'll be able to join the thousands of other analysts and weekend duffers in evaluating the most valuable golf swing on the planet. But if simply playing the game doesn't give you enough to go on just select Tiger as your player and just put the controller down.  His idle animation is a re-creation of that awesome commercial where he dribbles a golf ball on the end of his club. He keeps it bouncing while moving the ball between his legs and then behind his back before swatting it like Sammy Sosa into oblivion. Very cool and very well done.  The courses themselves can be a little bland at first with uninspired colors and designs, but some of the courses you open later look really neat. Our favorite is the night time course because it reminds of summer camp. Cyber Tiger is very entertaining golf game and is my choice for best golf game on the N64. What can I say, the analog control stick and human looking characters really do it for me. Golf fans can't really go wrong with either Tiger or Mario Golf, because both are really entertaining, but if you want anything close to sim, that's not Waialae Country Club, Cyber Tiger's got you covered. The solid golf mechanics carry the game but the exciting two player Battle Mode is a nice original bonus that squeezes all of the fun you could want out of a golf title. We wish there would have been more PGA golfers for sim fans to use in some of the more traditional game modes. It would've given the game a different feel by evening out the sim:arcade ratio, but if done right it could've been a complete well rounded experience", "date": "Mar 21, 2000"}
