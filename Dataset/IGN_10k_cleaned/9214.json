NBC's ~Heroes~ was one of the few stand-outs in the last batch of serial attempts, a series that followed normal people awakening to their very special powers. Sinister elements, such as Sylar and the man with horn-rimmed glasses, wanted to claim or exploit these gifts for ill-gotten gain. The theme of the first season -- save the cheerleader, save the world -- became a part of the cultural landscape. Now, as NBC launches the second season of the show, Gameloft tunes in with a mobile game following three of the shows heroes: Hiro, Niki, and Peter.   Gameloft does a right solid job capturing the essence of the series. Even though the character sprites are a tad small, fans will immediately pick up on the general vibe and enjoy dialogue and a scenario created with the help of the serial's writers. Players will enjoy moments ripped from the show, such as Hiro seeking his hero's sword from the museum while employing time-bending tricks.   There are eleven stages in Gameloft's Heroes, with each hero starring in a handful of levels. At the onset of the game, Niki must protect her son Micah from agents while escaping a Las Vegas casino. She uses her super strength to kick all kinds of ass, including a super-move that sees her zipping around her prey, delivering fatal blows. Niki can throw pieces of the environment at her enemies, which not only causes damage, but also releases power-ups, such as extra health and superpower recharge. (The game employs a power meter system that forces each hero to seek blue sphere to refill their super abilities.)   Hiro can bend the space-time continuum in order to outflank enemies or sneak around stealth stages, such as the museum. (He's joined by Ando at the beginning of his run, which is also a cool nod to fans.) Hiro's levels are little more puzzle-oriented. I'm not sure how much I want to give away about Hiro's exploits, as I came into the series late myself, but Hiro's time traveling lets him poke into the future as well as the present. He will see future New York and engage with evil-doers after earning the sword.   The third hero is Peter, who assumes other people's powers. Peter can fly, as well as move objects with his mind. While flying, Peter must constantly collect power-ups to stay aloft. Peter must also manipulate objects to build bridges, including a slick little block-puzzle sequence. He also has boss encounters with Sylar that are pretty cool. One is included in the screenshot gallery accompanying this review.   Other heroes also show up, even if they aren't playable, such as Claire and Nathan, to assist as well as fill in the story, which has the heroes trying to stop the evil Sylar from using Ted's nuclear powers and harvesting Claire's regeneration.   While Heroes is primarily an action game, there are all sorts of little moments like the aforementioned block puzzle that really flash out the game. I liked switching between flying, fighting, stealth, and other elements -- it keeps the game fresh across its eleven stages.  I cannot imagine why any Heroes fan would be disappointed in this game. Not only do all of their favorite characters appear in some form, but Gameloft does absolute justice by them with smart game play. The game looks great, with lots of little touches like the way Hiro runs that prove the developer researched the show more than just glancing over some photos. Even though it is a tad short, Heroes fans will definitely enjoy this game.", "date": "Oct 11, 2007"}
