Anyone who's ever busted out turntable-scratching action with Beat Mania or shaken their booty to Samba de Amigo can attest to the raw addictiveness of tune-based gameplay. After living in the shadow of Konami's arcade titles, along with various Playstation works of genius like UmJammer Lammy and PaRappa, Sega has finally kicked out their first musical title - and it kicks ass.   The man responsible for Space Channel 5 is none other than Tetsuya Mizuguchi, the AM team visionary who gave us this little game called Sega Rally. His team is located in the middle of Shibuya - the Japanese center of fashion, culture, and music. Space Channel 5 is a game that reflects the loopy energy and over-the-top design of Tokyo's most bustling neighborhood.   Sure, Space Channel 5 is a musical game, but you're not controlling rapping dogs or guitar-playing lambs. No no no. Instead, you've been thrown into the elevator shoes of Ulala, a 23rd-Century sexpot reporter with pink hair and a plastic mini-skirt. A handful of outer space locations, varying from intergalactic passenger liners to spaceports, have been invaded by the vaguely Teletubbie-like ~Mororians,~ who enslave humans by making them dance. Your mission is to save the humans, zap the Mororians, and look damn good while doing it.   The only way you can beat the Mororians is by dancing against them, and thanks to a simple control scheme, you'll be busting out moves in no time. It all boils down to a simplified version of Simon -- a Mororian will shout ~Up! Up! Left! Left! Right! Down! Shoot!~ in English, and you simply have to copy his movements to the beat. Ulala has two laser beams for shooting - one for blasting Mororians (the A button), and one for saving humans (the B button). And after you rescue humans from the Mororians' dancing spree, they come along and dance with you, making the game look like a number right out of West Side Story.  Fortunately, there's none of the square-circle-triangle-button confusion of UmJammer Lammy,  and the game encourages you to look at what's happening on the screen (as opposed to keeping your eyes glued on a four-bar progression at the top). And this is a game that's fun to watch - the art design is in the Sixties sci-fi vein (think Austin Powers), with bright colors, goofy outfits, and curvy architecture galore. The Mororian bosses are also quite cool, resembling sculptures of Tapioca pudding.   Technically, the game's a treat - Ulala and her fellow dancers are all rendered in real-time, while the backgrounds are streaming MPEG videos. This allows for super-detailed backgrounds with a loopy level of detail - the only downside is that MPEG ~artifacting~ is noticeable if you're running the game on a good TV (or you're using the VGA box). Also, some of the fast camera switches don't always sync up with the characters, and slowdown is rampant in some instances - it actually affects the gameplay in one or two locations. Grr.    Of course, the music is what makes Space Channel 5 special, with its brassy overtones and syncopated drum riffs. The music makes a few shifts through the course of the game, from big band to classical to techno, but it always works, and I strongly recommend playing the game loud.  Though you can play through the four stages of Space Channel 5 in about an hour (once you've mastered it, anyway), there are plenty of extra goodies just waiting to be unlocked, including multiple side-quests to new locations, and character profiles. (One interesting note: Michael Jackson himself is actually in the game - his first Sega appearance since Moonwalker.) The only thing that's really missing is a two-player mode - or a four-player mode for an entire dancing troupe...  All in all, Space Channel 5 is one weird game. The over-the-top dancing fruitiness may be too bizarre for a good portion of the game-playing population, but for those of us who enjoy a good dance number every now and then, it's worth its weight in gold. We can only hope that Sega will follow Sony's lead, and release this little gem for American audiences. Rock on, Ulala.   -- Colin ~Donnie Wahlberg~ Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 22, 1999"}
