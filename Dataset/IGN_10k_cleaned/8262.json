Compared to the super-fast sci-fi thrills of WipEout and the gritty street-racing in Need for Speed, Formula One is like a Sunday drive - albeit in a really expensive car. However, what F1 games lack in balls-out action they make up for with realism and in that respect Formula One Championship Edition is no exception. In fact it's a thoroughly accurate simulation, and one which will appeal to dedicated racing fans as well as more casual players who fancy being Michael Schumacher for a couple of hours.   The reason F1 CE appeals to such a wide audiance is because it's literally packed with options. Players can tailor their racing experience so it's either as realistic or arcade-y as they wish. There's a full-blown season mode for drivers who want to experience every last detail of racing for a proper F1 team. At the other end of the scale there's the quick race option, which assumes your driving gloves are boxfresh and that your knowledge of F1 extends to knowing that the shiny things on four wheels are called cars.   It's almost worth driving around slowly, so you can see the detailed tracks.  In quick race's default easy setting your hand is firmly held while you get to grips with the finer points of driving. A number of driving aids help even the most inexperienced driver around the track and these range from bog-standard options like an automatic gear box to more sophisticated aids such as braking assistance and stability control.   With all these switched on Formula One Championship Edition is essentially a pick-up-and-play arcade game, one where players need only acclerate and point the car in the right direction to get round the circuit, because the AI handles everything else. And while seasoned pros will turn their noses up in digust at these aids, they're great for rookie racers because it enables them to race against - and beat - the best drivers in the F1 world. Also, bearing in mind that Formula One is really quite a niche title aimed only at those with a passion for the sport, we think that make it more accessible to casual players can only be a good thing, because it broadens the game's limited appeal.   That's not to say F1 CE doesn't have depth. After you've got the hang of how the car handles it's worth switching off the driving aids (one by one, unless you want to be dumped in at the deep end) to up the ante and experience the real thrills of F1. You see, letting the AI control the more complex elements of driving is pretty much a necessity when you first start placing, but continue in the same vein and racing soon becomes dull.   By experimenting with different aids turned off, however, you can find a balance that perfectly suits your skill level, enabling you to taste victory but still be presented with a challenge. Thankfully it can be tweaked mid-race too, so you can always fall back on the AI if you're struggling to keep up.   Trying to overtake opponents is like chess on wheels at 120mph.  But, as much we like the driving aids, we would've really liked to have seen a comprehensive tutorial mode in the game, one that took the player through the subtleties of F1 racing step by step. Instead of the good-for-nothing guide currently in the game we would've liked to have seen hands-on lessons, much like those in Gran Turismo, that took players through the different elements of racing such as overtaking and braking.     Whether you're driving solo or with the help of AI, racing is always an intense and exciting experience, and one that relies on genuine skill and tactics. You'll be sorely disappointed if you expect to take the chequered flag by ramming your way through the field because you'll be nudged off the track or, even worse, lose a wheel, causing your race to end. Instead you must drive with your head as much as your hands, waiting for the right time to strike and overtake.   Even on the easiest settings Championship Edition is still a daunting challenge, particularly when you're in first place and there's pack of racers swarming over your rear spoiler. And while some will no doubt hate the game's tactical approach to racing, others will revel in a chance to show off their driving skill.   Visually it's one of the prettiest PS3 launch titles... if you like cars.  As your driving confidence grows you'll notice how tight and responsive the controls are. Although you're often driving at speeds of over 100mph, it always feels like you have complete control over your car. There are a lot of nice touches in the way the SIXAXIS works too, like using the analogue buttons to mimic the throttle so you have precise control over the gas. Sure, it's nothing particularly new but it really works here, squeezing the buttons hard along a straight and then easing off on the approach to a bend. For fans of in-depth, realistic racers like Gran Turismo, Formula One is an absolute treat because it's so thorough in the way it accurately recreates the controls on a joypad.   However, one thing that doesn't particular work, in our opinion at least, is the overly-complicated career mode. Unless you're a die-hard F1 fan you'll find it almost impenetrable, because you have to play through half a dozen set-up, practice and qualifying laps before you even get a sniff of another car. Then, when you do finally make it out on the track, it's all too easy to make a single wrong move and write off your race completely, meaning you have to go through all of the qualifying laps again before the next proper race begins.   Of course, it's possible to skip all the pre-race tinkering and practice laps but as a result you'll always start at the back of the pack, so your chances of F1 glory are pretty much zero. Considering the trouble Sony went to ensuring the driving was immediately accessible, it seems strange the career mode stalls right from the beginning.   In replays it's almost like you're watching an actual Formula One race.  Career mode aside, Formula One Championship Edition is still a decent game. Visually it delivers a real knockout punch and it's certainly one of the best looking launch titles for PS3. The cars in particular look wonderful, especially when the sun glints off the polished bodywork when you're thundering around the course. There's no hint of slowdown either, even with 22 cars on the screen at once, and the lighting effects - especially on the dawn qualifying laps - are truly stunning. Occasionally the car doesn't always look like it's gripping the surface of the track, but it's hardly noticeable when you're busy soaking up the atmosphere coming first at Silverstone.Formula One Championship Edition manages to tread the fine line between realism and fun. With the driving aids on anyone can pick up the pad and have an enjoyable race around all the official F1 track. However, for those that want more depth the options are there to make this an extremely technical racer that requires a lot of skill. Admittedly it would have been better to include a thorough tutorial to help players understand the skills behind driving like a pro rather than let the AI do all the hard work, but it's not a deal breaker. However, the games biggest mistake is having a career mode that is overly complicated, potentially frustrating and actually rather boring. F1 purists may appreciate it but we doubt even they'll want to race around the same track over and over again, just to make sure theyve got the right tyres on their car.", "date": "Mar 22, 2007"}
