The game to date has drawn out for what seems thousands of years the plight of the vampire successor Kain and the preachy, tortured wraith Raziel. When I sat down to play this game, though, I wasn't excited at all. I said to myself that if this one doesn't answer a slew of questions, I would simply turn away in disgust from the whole series. No turning back.   Sounds like betrayal from a fan, doesn't it? Hell yeah it does. But after five games and so little resolution, just more and more questions, all the blood in the world couldn't wipe away the tortured waiting. The endless waiting for something to happen -- The trickle of storyline shrouded in mysteries wrapped in riddles, and then so little resolution.   But Crystal Dynamics came through. Not only does it deliver the story fans of the series have been waiting for since Raziel had his wings ripped from his back, they answered nearly everything I have been dying to know since the first game so long ago. Plus, the game is no longer simply a vehicle for the storyline. It's a well rounded title, complete with a robust combat system and for the first time ever, the ability to play as both Kain and Raziel in the same game. I know what you're thinking too: Does the game end the series? Some things are best left unanswered. At least until you play the game.    Story  Editor's Note: I have been careful to navigate away from spoiling anything significant in the story in this review, but if you simply don't want any surprises, even in the slightest, then I suggest you stop reading now.    The fifth in the Legacy of Kain series, Legacy of Kain: Defiance follows the epic drama of three major races -- vampire, human and Hylden -- all in a passionate fight for control the world, each one pursuing their idea of the ~true~ prophecy. The story is massive, perhaps equal in labyrinthine complexities as the Metal Gear Solid series, and far, far too long to summarize for the purposes of this review. LOK: Defiance, however, finally gets the ball moving by resolving major questions from both Kain and Raziel.     For fans of the series, you're in for a treat. You'll finally learn what the hell is going on! The roles and relationships of Moebius, the Elder God, the Hylden and the Demon Beasts are laid plain for everyone to see; and Kain and Raziel both fulfill their destinies with exhilarating conflicts and resolutions. For newcomers to the series (and even for those of us who have been following the series), LOK: Defiance does a solid job of explaining what has happened thus far with in-game dialog and an economic summarization of the series thus far in the manual. So, while it's better to have followed the series (just as if you had been following, say, The Matrix or the Lord of the Rings), this game is moderately accessible to those who have been intimidated to play in the past.    That's all I have to say about that right now.     Gameplay  An action-adventure game using a hybrid set/roving camera system and a deep new combat system, LOK: Defiance is also the first in the series to enable players to take on the roles of both Kain and Raziel under one title. The story unfolds with players taking on the role of Kain and then switching to Raziel and then back to Kain again, and so forth, as each segment of the game is broken into chapters. Both handle almost identically, each using the Soul Reaver in its various forms, each in a different time period. Kain is more of an action type, so he fights more often, while Raziel solves lots of puzzles using his ability to switch from the material to the spectral realms.    This year's model rewrites the book on combat, however. If Soul Reaver 2 wasn't your idea of fun, you'll probably like this system, which continues to grow on you as the game progresses. Both Kain and Raziel primarily fight using their swords, and utilizing the Z-trigger aiming system introduced back in Soul Reaver 1, Raziel and Kain lock onto the enemy closest to them.    Uppercuts and combinations of horizontal slashes are joined by a slew of new TK or Telekenesis moves. Using the invisible power of mind control, Kain and Raziel can lift, throw, bounce or simply hold their enemies in air using TK. The implementation of this element deepens the combat system tenfold as it works with air combat, juggles, and the pleasurable torture items found in the environment. Kain and Raziel can hurl their enemies off bridges, they can throw them onto hooks strategically placed on walls, or they can chuck them into fires. TK fighting isn't just fun for a short while. It's superbly implemented into the heart of the combat, and it's very, very, very fun. Experimenting with it can easily extend fights long beyond their normal length.   Adding another layer to the already robust fighting system is the collection of new moves. Since the game is structured as a keyhunt/combat game/storytelling vehicle, you'll do a lot of fighting against an increasingly fierce set of enemies. The game does a good job of merging puzzles into the core of the game, as opposed to segmenting them out (as exemplified in Soul Reaver 2). As you confront more Hylden, Demon Beasts, Sarafan and Knights (plus a couple very good bosses, including a surprise boss from Raziel's past), you'll find collectibles to increase your abilities. Artifacts help you access doors and such; Health Talismans increase health, Telekenesis Runes increase your TK meter (the vertical green one); Arcane Tomes open up special bonuses, and your combat experience grows with each enemy you fight. Each is presented with clear menus and in an easy-to-use manner.    Players earn more complex moves as the game gets more intense. Five special moves are earned, each giving Raziel and Kain new combinations to counter bigger enemies. There is also sword magic to wield against enemies as well as the ability to maximize your Reaver for deadly attacks. Then there are the various Reavers (nine for Raziel, six for Kain), which work as means to attack and defend, but also to solve puzzles. Neither character can block, but Raziel's quick side tumble and Kain's speedy mist dodge make up for blocking. Plus the strafing works extremely well.     The combat is really good, but more often then I'd like, the new camera system -- which works superbly in some ways -- hampers the experience greatly. More frequently with Raziel's fights than with Kain's, there is a slew of problems. You fight characters off screen; you actually face into the camera, and as the enemy disappears, you're supposed to attack it; and far too manyh times your character fights enemies hidden behind a banister, railing or pillar. Overall, you just can't see what's going on. Other games, namely Devil May Cry and even Ico use cameras of this nature, but this one is less friendly, i.e. less polished, than either. Simple things like the foreground and background get in the way. Everyday objects just block your view. With cameras like this objects often become transparent. But not here.   Another major problem that detracts from the excellent combat is based on collision detection. Kain or Raziel will be in a fight in a room, and they'll get locked on to an enemy that's outside the room. It's something that can be dealt with, but in a frenzied situation, it's a very bad problem to have. To be honest, the game is rife with collision detection problems especially in the Spectral world. Enemies disappear into the walls, they get stuck in between objects such as doors and chairs, and your own characters blend into objects. In several cases, Raziel loses his footing on totally solid objects, and in a really weird set of levels, he'll run into invisible walls. It's frustrating to see a game that's improved so much, that's so beautiful and that tells such a deep, compelling story whittled away with little things that could -- and should -- have been fixed with a slightly longer testing period.   Still, the dual character scheme works incredibly well. Kain uses his assorted abilities to drink blood (from afar and right on the neck), turn to mist, vault across huge gaps using a superhuman leap and, best of all, he transforms into bats to quickly travel across long distances. Kain can slow down his descent in mid air too. Raziel feels the same as a controllable character so gamers won't have to relearn any major moves, but his powers are slightly different. He devours souls when in the spectral realm, and he too can pass through barriers in this realm. Unlike Kain, who dies when he touches water, Raziel can swim. A neat touch is that when switching to the Earth Reaver, Raziel can walk and attack while underwater. Both Kain and Raziel can glide while in air. The only problem that we found while switching back and forth is water. It's hard to remember after switching back so often that Kain cannot touch water. Sounds silly, because it's so obvious, but after a few hours, watch and see how you will move Kain right into a deadly one-inch puddle of water.    In all, LOK: Defiance feels like a highly enhanced Soul Reaver, modified with a deep new fighting system and killer TK modifications. It's very linear, much like Soul Reaver 2, which is a disappointment. You fight, solve puzzles, fight some more, and listen to the story. The cameras are both a blessing and a curse, and the collision detection, well, that needs to be worked out before the game ships. But all in all, the integration of puzzles and action into less separate, more bundled parts sits well by me. Raziel still deals with the bulk of the puzzles, and somehow using the Spectral world is daunting, making one feel like they're just about to gamble away hours worth of progress. After playing three games with the spectral world, I'll admit, it's still confusing and disorienting in that netherworld of souls.    Graphics  On the PlayStation 2, I think it's fair to say, nobody does textures as well as Crystal Dynamics in the Legacy of Kain series. The team always shows off its incredible knowledge of Middle Eastern designs and gothic architecture, but in LOK: Defiance the visuals are so diverse, so extravagant, so detailed, it's daunting to take it all in. The decadent nature of the vampires is shown in its fullest here, with extravagant rugs, ornate tapestries and highly stylized cathedrals, castles, and city structures.    Depending on your tastes, you'll have an opinion about Raziel's spectral realm, which is now emblazoned with a blur effect, causing everything to look ghostly and spiritual. I liked it for an hour and then felt like it was too much. Example: My stepson felt ill after playing an hour in the spectral realm. I couldn't find an option to turn it off, so I suspect we'll all stuck with it. The framerate and the issue of aliasing, which are things Crystal D is always a stickler about, are weird here. The framerate is usually high, and holds on tight during multi-enemy fights. But in rooms with nobody but Kain or Raziel, it dips down, sometimes even in cutscenes. Also, the game often falls into a weird state of aliasedness. All of a sudden, it falls out of whack.    But there is so much good work done in other areas.  All the cutscenes are created with in-game models and they transition sweetly from the game and back to it. The lighting is drop dead gorgeous, with shadows creating complex shapes on the ground, and excellent shades of light casting characters with subtleties found in very few games. The highly sophisticated lighting just adds to the already tremendous sense of atmosphere deeply imbued in the lush looking series. There is also an enormous amount of special effects at work, whether it's blur effects for the TK moves, simple powdery snowflakes falling from the sky, or the extravagent use of light, reflection and particles.   Sound  Blending simple chant style songs, one of which reminds me of Peter Gabriel's ~Biko~, with atmospheric effects and super voice acting, Crystal D has once again helped form a spooky, intriguing cascade of sounds that work well in LOK: Defiance.     The famous voice acting work done so well in the early Kain days is replicated here with great resound. Michael Bell (Raziel), Simon Templeman (Kain), Tony Jay (The Elder God) and Richard Doyle (Moebius), among others, have returned with their deep, rich character voice-overs. It's amazing too that so little extra work is done to enhance their collective voices. These guys are just damn good are talking like vampires, tortured souls and gods. It's also great to hear these superb and over-the-top death wails. When enemies are thrown over a bridge, their yells seem to last forever. They're also incredibly pained. Given the context of the game, these moans, screams of pain, and last gasps of breath are exquisitely done; they sit right in the border of being deadly serious and deftly comic. Both work for me.    One thing that's always bugged me about the series, and that I could never quite pinpoint before, is the sound of the enemies in combat. For all the heavy hitting these characters do, it's amazing they sound like wet kittens getting whacked. Or better yet, pancakes flopping onto the wet ground, and then being pounced on by wet kittens. It's all too soft and subtle, like hot oatmeal hitting the tile floor (and then being pounced on by wet kittens with pancakes attached to their feet). In other words, there is something not quite right about the mushy wet sounds these characters make.The long-standing Legacy of Kain series finally hits paydirt with one of the best stories in the series and without a doubt, one of the best combat systems in an action-adventure series. But does anyone care anymore? Did Blood Omen 2 and Soul Reaver 2 push everyone away for good? I don't know, but despite its problems and the still difficult-to-relate-to stylized universe, this is a must-have in the series. And I was ready to just give up on old Kain too. But like I said earlier, Crystal Dynamics gets right to the heart of all matters in this episode. When you're not gawking at the superb visuals or learning how Kain and Raziel will settle their scores, you'll be deeply involved in combat or solving some ridiculously elaborate physical puzzle in the spectral world. In many ways, this is the same basic game that Crystal D showed us in Soul Reaver, just highly evolved. And believe it or not, an enormous amount of stuff happens. The story is outrageously good. You won't believe what happens. So, is it the last game in the series? It very well could be. But I'm not telling. Go play it yourself. It's finally worth it. One last note: Looking back on the scoring of Soul Reaver 2 (which at 9.0, was way too high), all I can say is that hindsight proves to be 20-20. That game told a great story, but just didn't deserve that score. With LOK: Defiance I scored it just as I would if no other scores had been given to the series.", "date": "Nov 12, 2003"}
