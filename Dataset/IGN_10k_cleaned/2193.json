Never in my wildest dreams would I think that Electro could fit that bill -- he's not that big of an enemy, and it made me a little worried if he were the biggest threat the in game. Maybe it's just me, but I wasn't that excited about the game culminating with Electro.   Like the first Spider-Man game, Spider-Man 2 Enter: Electro is a third-person, action-based superhero game. You play Spider-Man and try to stop Electro from taking over the world, a typical scenario that we might have been a little more forgiving about had the game not doubled its camera/control problems. But what's happened is just that. Throughout the game you swing from building to building, picking up power-ups, beating up thugs and hired goons, and every so often confronting a boss who then proceeds to whip the living tar out of you.    In the process of playing Spider-Man 2, I realized that it is one of the most frustrating games I have ever played. From the time I read the title with ~Electro~ in it, to the end of the game, I was frustrated and letdown. From the heightened control and camera problems to the unforgiving bosses, Spider-Man 2 Enter: Electro is not the better sequel to its predecessor, but an unfortunate second chapter in a series that needs some serious work, and that's not that much fun.  Gameplay The game starts out timidly, like the first Spider-Man, but don't be fooled.  Enter Electro definitely will have kids crying and adults throwing controllers across the room.  You will realize this as soon as you hit the first boss, the Shocker. Shocker is by far the hardest boss in the game. With you having to pull boxes on him with your webs, the annoying controls, coupled with the Shocker's quick recovery time, create instant madness and frustration. The new web-pulling features are sloppily implemented and don't add any fun to what should be a fun superhero to play. The Shocker boss section is just the tip of the iceberg, but it's the best example of how Spider-Man 2 needs serious help.   The new control features blow. Why? The controls are a lot looser compared to the first game, and a lot less precise. The game demands that you become more skilled with the new moves, which, when coupled with the less precise features, create bigger control issues than the first game presented. The constantly changing camera angles make controlling Spider-Man very confusing. When walking on the sides of buildings with the angles constantly switching, players become entirely disoriented. You constantly have to compensate with your d-pad. This generally isn't so hard if you're not being pummeled by an incredibly aggressive enemy, but in this game, you're almost always being pummeled by incredibly aggressive enemies.   Here's another example of the game's control issues: The basic switch functionality -- when trying to hit buttons or pull levers, or when you get to close to the button/switch -- doesn't recognize that you're trying to hit or pull something. So, instead of being rewarded by getting to the switch during a timed mission, or while fighting a boss, you continue to punch the wall as some thug slowly machine guns you to death. You have to make up for the game's problems by overcompensating for them.   Surprisingly enough, the bosses seem to get easier and easier. Even though stopping the plane in the hanger (Second Boss) seemed close to impossible it seemed easier than Shocker. For each new boss I found myself using less continues and swearing less (OK, I admit, the swearing continued as a constant flow).  But the levels themselves did grow more difficult.  The levels consisted of looking for keys for a bomb, destroying lasers, climbing tall buildings, rescuing hostages, avoiding traps, your usual superhero game. While these were fun, refreshing and even entertaining in Spider-Man, they're not so new and definitely not very refreshing in Spider-Man 2. The game's sterile set-up and plain by-the-book formula doesn't improve over anything that the first game did, but instead does, for the most part, a worse job at handling the formula.    The game has all of the same power-ups as the fist Spiderman, plus a few new ones. Health, webs, armor, and comic books are all there again. Electric webs, ice webs, tasers, and special electricity armor complete your arsenal. You still look for comic books throughout the levels, which opens up pictures in the gallery mode, but either there are simply fewer comic books or they're much harder to find, because I had a difficult time finding even a handful of them.    Replay value?  If you want to give yourself a migraine, go ahead and play this game again. For those of you who like bad controls and crazily switching camera angles, this game does have replay value.  With all of the comics to find (I'm sure they're in the game), and costumes to unlock, you could be playing this game for a long time. You may be playing it for a long time anyway, since you'll have to replay every boss several times to beat them.   Graphics While Spider-man had pretty good graphics the first time around, these graphics look average. The framerate is very low, lower than in the first game, and the choppy look takes away from most of the game's feel. I wish that during the movie sequences the mouths moved, because how can I take Electro seriously, when he's constantly gritting his teeth. (Wait a minute did I just say Electro and Seriously in the same sentence?)  But then again I have to realize this is a PlayStation game, and not a PlayStation 2 game.   Overall, the game is decent looking, but it's certainly no better looking than the first one, and in my mind, it's more of a degradation of the first.  Sound The novelty of the first game's Spider-man theme was nice; it's what you expected, and it was jazzed up and kind of smoking, when you listened carefully to it. But the music in this game did not add or take away from the game. It was just all right, but certainly not memorable. The game would of rocked if it had the original Spider-Man theme song or even the Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends opening. ~Spiderman, Spiderman, Doing the things a spider can.  Spins a web, fast as light, he's made of radioactive dynamite!  Look out!  Here comes the Spiderman!~ With regard to the voices, the enemies seemed to sound slightly more cheesy than before, with Electro being the main cause of annoyance. Final thoughts on Spider-Man 2 Enter: Electro?  Don't buy this game.  If you want to rent this one go ahead but heed my warning traveler, you will be disappointed.  After every level, after every boss, every fiber in my body was begging me to quit, but I trudged on. Swinging, punching, webbing, camera changing, camera changing, camera changing... NO!  No I say!  This game was so unrewarding, even after I beat Electro... Twice!  I am distressed that Spider-Man, one of my favorite Marvel heroes, has his name stuck to this game (but then again, there was that Spider-Man vs. X-men game that came out for Super Nintendo... ugh.).  The game's controls were the reason I hated it so much; I'm sorry I come back to this so much, but the controls are just so bad! Combined with the drunk cameraman, it made this game hard, not in the challenging fun way of ~Wow they took a lot of time to make this game good!~  but in the ~I CAN'T DO ANYTHING!~ kind of hard. As cool as that may sound to playa Spider-Man game again, it's just not that fun.", "date": "Oct 30, 2001"}
