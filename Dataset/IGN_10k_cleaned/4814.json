Unfortunately, good things tend cost a lot of money. Even then, however, sturdy game design can shine through underwhelming production values. The Command & Conquer and Blizzard games aren't particularly known for their cutting-edge visuals, but they excel in addictiveness and replayability. Bad Boys II reminds us of what Hollywood has been doing with gaming for years, with only a few notable exceptions rising out of the murk--Escape from Butcher Bay, Spiderman 2, GoldenEye--and those are all console titles. PC doesn't get much love in this department. The original movie, officially, cost a little under $20 million, not including marketing. The sequel eight years later had a marketing budget twice that of the original production budget. So I know these people aren't strapped for cash.  The first thing you'll notice about BB2 is that Marcus Bennet and Mike Lowry don't look or sound anything like Martin Lawrence or Will Smith. The dialogue has the right feel--quick, smirky, sarcastic--and they deliver the lines pretty well across the board, but Empire could have picked a couple guys that at least tried to sound like their film counterparts, as Fox Interactive did with the Die Hard Trilogy several years backanother console title. Sigh. Anyways, this is a road bump that can be overcome, as long as the road is worth driving on. It's not. Yeah, I'll just get that out of the way.  It isn't that the game is kinda boring, or mediocre visually and gameply-wise. There are Problems. The AI is nearly nonexistent, instead relying on basic location triggers and a few rote tactics. One consists of standing in the middle of the room and shooting at you. The other consists of crouching behind an obstacle for a few seconds, then standing up and shooting at you. Your tactics will almost never require nothing more than walking up to the trigger point, then backing away and picking them off at medium to long range.    Each map is strewn with glowing circles that signify a place where your character (Marcus or Mike, the game swaps each guy arbitrarily as you progress) can stand beside a door and ~lean~ around, which he can't do automatically. The circles can be handy if you want to find cover quickly, as hitting the space bar when you're close enough will tell the guy to do a duck and roll or sprint. But as the AI is so dumb, you'll almost never need this. And since ~leaning~ isn't actually leaning, but swiveling around to stand in the middle of the doorway, the circles aren't very useful at all. But they are almost always the trigger points. So, find circle, get close to it, hit space bar, and back up to a spot where you can actually avoid the bullets. Wash, rinse, repeat.  Unfortunately, you don't always have the option to open a door from the side, using the above method. This is a bad thing because the enemies already spawned in the room are physically tuned to which door you'll be bursting through and will be pumping leg before you've gotten your bearings. This is particularly painful when there's someone right on the other side of the door with a shotgun, because you can't start firing until you've agonizingly completed the ~kicking through the door~ animation. This is also particularly painful because of all the closed doors between you and the end of the game, and because you can only (1) kick them open or (2) open from the side with a circle trigger and dash for a safe spot. Every time you ~lean~ out from the side, you'll have several dudes plugging you. Enemies will also magically trigger from spawn points you knew were completely empty only moments before.      The pain doesn't end there, though. BB2 uses a rather conservative save game method, only bookmarking your progress once, at the beginning of a stage. I can deal with at least progressive auto-saves, or some kind of save game object you have to find. But when the game is already little better than a way to kill time, there's not much joy to be found in repeating the same ten to fifteen minutes you just played through if you die during the boss fight at the tail end. At least save it right before I have to fight the stage boss.  The icing on the cake is that the story is vague, convoluted, and told through excessively grainy cutscenes, using a graphics engine that seems a cut above the in-game stuff, but barely. This is particularly disappointing because the game is based on a movie, which I'm told is a story told with visuals. Granted, the film wasn't exactly a character-driven masterpiece, but there's a story there that just didn't get translated to the computer screen in one piece, just a string of pieces.  As you can probably tell, the graphics and sound don't answer the call to arms, either. As far as sound, I don't expect every weapon to be meticulously modeled with action, heft, and acoustics, but all the guns in BB2 sound anemic. The sidearm--which has infinite ammo--sounds like a popgun. The revolver sounds like a bigger pop gun. The shotguns sound like someone hitting you in the face with a stiff pillow. The menu screen transitions, sadly, are divided with a satisfyingly punchy pistol report that I never heard in the game.  Besides those weapons, there's also the AK-47, silenced pistol, submachine gun, silenced sub, semi-automatic shotgun, grenades, and a few others. You can only carry one weapon at a time besides the infinite .45, which is fair enough. However, this nod to realism becomes odd when you discover that you keep all the ammo you pick up. Shoot around with a pump shotgun for a bit, trade it for the AK, pick it up again a little later in the stage, and you'll have a gun nut-sized pile of shells from all the boxes you've been picking up along the way. You'll also lose everything but the sidearm when you start a new stage, even if that next stage is chronologically contiguous.    As far as visuals, the engine is pretty dated. Textures are generally muddy, animation is stiff, and character models are kinda lumpy. You can't really tell from the postage stamp-sized shots on the back of box, but it's really nothing to write home about. Yeah, maybe we're spoiled these days. I wish I'd had something nice to look at while I trudged my way through. There's a surprising amount of object destructibility, but blowing something up doesn't always kill someone standing right next to it, and some things burst into a ball of flame that shouldn't, like a computer or solar panel. It's a nice addition, but not enough to make things interesting.Although we've had a couple fantastic movie license games recently, we still have a long way to go before the subgenre can compete with the rest. If Bad Boys II does have anything good for it, there is some visceral fun in plugging away at bad guys for a while that the game gets right some of the time, when the enemy isn't busy ducking behind objects that leave his head exposed or magically appearing from an empty corner of a room. In the end, the game is destined to fade from the popular consciousness at least as quickly as the movie, which is probably a good thing for Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, who deserve better than either product.", "date": "Jun 30, 2004"}
