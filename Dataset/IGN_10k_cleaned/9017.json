Sure, the market is obviously there, but it seems like such a cruel fate to thrust upon your brainchild, knowing it will be condemned to labels like ~clone~ or ~rip-off.~ Nevertheless, Polish developer Reality Pump has stepped up with a confident swagger, proud to steal from the best, and confident it can stand on its own.    It's a tall order. Oblivion wrapped a massive amount of content and overwhelming level of freedom in a package that oozed high-class production value, with an accessibility that helped lure in the console audience that had long eluded computer role-playing games. Two Worlds seems to have all the basics down, with miles of terrain and bustling cities full of more to do than you'll care to explore. For those that like to roam rather than barrel through the adventure, there's a near endless flow of side-quests to take on, and some of these have interesting consequences. All of this comes together in a seamless world, with only the briefest loading pauses.    Ye models are decent but thy faces aren't  But it only takes a few minutes to spot the chinks in the armor The visuals are rife with awkward, sometimes glitchy animations and objects that just pop in, seemingly from no where. There doesn't seem to be any physics simulation, and there are plenty of bugs in the collision detection, so expect to occasionally see people walk through each other or pop through walls. Even worse, movement will chug when the action gets too hot and heavy, regardless of whether you're playing on a high-end gaming PC or the 360.    It's not a terribly appealing world, either. You assume the role of a bounty hunter tasked with collecting all the magic doo-dads to stop the resurrection of an evil god. Tired fantasy clichs are flung around like confetti throughout the awkward, Old English dialogue. Like a lot of Eastern European games, it has embarrassingly bad, voice acting, too. Imagine Steven Wright at a Renaissance Fair, and you'll have a pretty good idea of what to expect.    Are you still with us? I know all these problems seem like a tough pill to swallow, but first impressions aren't everything. Despite the copious minor flaws that will chase many away in the first few hours, there is actually a lot to love here. Two Worlds makes some smart decisions that help it stand out just enough to be worth a second look.   Shiny... sort of  One of the biggest flaws with Oblivion was the decision to make enemies automatically scale to your level, so that the challenge level stayed fixed. This gave you the freedom to go where you wanted, but it eliminated the satisfaction of building up your character in preparation of a long and arduous quest. Luckily, Two Worlds avoids this trap. You'll find enemies that kill you in a single hit, and eventually you'll be able to crush those same foes in seconds. It's a satisfying feeling that ought to be a part of any good role-playing game, and it's complimented by a robust system for building skills, giving this game plenty of depth.   The quest itself is very open-ended, at least after the first couple hours or so. Making progress is more than a simple matter of traveling from place to place marked on your map. Instead you'll need to take on many side-quests to build your reputation in order to make the allies you need to achieve your goals. This might not appeal to shotgun players who don't want to roam the countryside or talk to random villagers, but those that prefer a more leisurely pace will enjoy the sense of consequence it lends. Seeing sub-plots unfold and your reputation evolve can be a lot of fun.   The combat is a change of pace. It plays best in third-person, though the option is there for first-person as well. You'll be able to dole out some nifty-looking combos, and a dodge button lets you quickly avoid your enemy's strikes. The fighting is simple, has a nice stick-and-move rhythm to it, and the different weapons lend enough variety to keep things interesting. The AI is straightforward and predictable, so don't expect action on par with Dark Messiah, but it works. I don't like it as much as Oblivion's system, but it isn't really comparable.    Getting around is a snap, thanks to abundant teleports all over the map. You can zip around with ease between any teleports you've passed in your travels, which really helps streamline those endless hikes that have always been my least favorite part of games like this. You'll have access to horses and other mounts as well, but unfortunately these can't go through teleports with you.     Death isn't the cruel fate it once was. Dying in battle will simply find back at the nearest shrine, rarely more than a few hundred yards away, with all of your possessions safe and sound. These shrines will also heal you whenever you walk within range, which can be easily abused for some cheap victories. Of course, if you're looking for more of a challenge, the Hard setting has no re-spawn.    Not all the new additions work well, unfortunately. Much has been made of the horseback combat, a feature sorely lacking in similar games. It's nice to be able to pull out a spear and bust some skulls as your ride by, but the equestrian portion of the game controls so poorly, it's not effective to do so.    In fact, I can say without hyperbole that the horse riding in Two Worlds features the worst controls I've ever experienced in a game. I realize that horses do, indeed, have minds of their own, but perhaps this is not the best aspect of riding to simulate in a game. When your horse doesn't feel he can go a certain way, he goes off on his own, sometimes heading in the opposite direction of the one you're pressing. You learn to work around this and stick to the main roads, but trying to navigate the horse through complex terrain or tight spaces is simply more trouble than it's worth.    Horse combat bad, verily  And then there's the online co-operative play. The idea of playing a game like this with a band of buddies is an enticing one, but it might not be what you're expecting. You won't be able to just hop into the single player game with a couple of friends. The multi-player portion is like a separate game.    You'll need to make a new character solely for your online exploits. In the PC version you can meet up in a city that acts like a lobby, much like the ones in Phantasy Star Online. Here you can explore shops, talk to other players, and form a party to venture out on a quest. Although the multi-player maps represent only a fraction of the size of the single player game, they're still pretty large. More importantly, they offer the same open-ended gameplay of the single player game, allowing you to explore freely and take on whatever missions you choose. You'll still get all the fun of building up your character, but you'll just need to accept that the badass you powered up in the solo game will never see any co-op action.   To really enjoy the multi-player, you'll need to have some friends committed to regular play, since finding a decent game with strangers can be a bit difficult. If you have reliable buddies, the online portion isn't ~broken,~ as some have declared. It's just a different approach, and in many ways it makes more sense than just dumping more players into the solo game. As long as you understand what you're getting and you have willing friends, it's a great feature.    Magic is as magic does  Oblivion is not a giant easily felled, and Two Worlds is not going to be the game to do it. If you can live with that, this could be a good RPG to spend the end of your summer on. The designers had a good handle on what they wanted and they've created a game with a ton of depth. Unfortunately, the execution is flawed. This game is glitchy and unpolished, and these quirks will prevent it from duplicating the real key to Oblivion's success: mainstream appeal.   Don't let the average score fool you into thinking this is a simple matter of mediocrity. This will be a polarizing game. There are people out there  especially the hardcore computer-RPG nuts that have been rocking Elder Scrolls since Arena  who are going to love it. These are people numb to a world of bugs and glitches who can enjoy deep role-playing at the expense of spit and polish. Other people are going to hate it. The game has some very real issues that you might not be willing to overlook. If anything, the modest length of the quest makes it a perfect rental for those on the fence, and the online mode might give it the staying power it needs for the cult of fans that will embrace it.", "date": "Sep 11, 2007"}
