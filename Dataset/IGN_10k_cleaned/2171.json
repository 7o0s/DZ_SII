{"name": "Project Eden", "name_review": "Project Eden", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/10/16/project-eden-2", "text": "As a member of the elite Urban Protection Agency, it's your job to safeguard the lives of the citizens that inhabit massive cities of the future that spiral skyward. Too bad for those that dwell beneath the boundaries of the city, deep in its many intricate sub-levels, that rule doesn't apply. Much as today's modern cities grow outward to accommodate the growing populace, Eden and all other cities of the future will grow upward, to such a degree that the Earth's diameter will expand and the lower levels of these cities, the desolate bowels of an urban sprawl long forgotten, will harbor the ~under life.~   Machinery at the ~Real Meat~ factory has gone haywire and technician teams sent in to address the problem have gone missing. Lead your four person UPA team into the manufacturing plant and as deep into the cavernous city depths as is necessary to rescue whomever you can and solve the mystery at hand.   Project Eden is a first and third person squad-based science fiction adventure/action/puzzle game that relies heavily on setting and mood to facilitate a logical progression of puzzles that require a sensible eye and proper usage of the game's four characters to complete.   Upon first entrance into the world of Project Eden, you'll realize something, when they say the game takes place in a massive vertical city, they mean massive. Contrary to engines of late that, however advanced, are primarily flat in design with maybe several two or three-story structures dotting winding corridors, Eden is capable of drawing immense series' of elaborate architecture at truly dizzying heights. Just looking up nearly anytime in an ~outdoor~ environment (said loosely because the entire thing takes place in a packed city after all) and you'll be dazzled by the lush, incredibly well articulated, vibrantly colorful buildings and structures that comprise the mega city. That's not to say it's without its claustrophobia. No, in fact the levels in Project Eden are both vast in scale as well as proportion. It may take you up to an hour or more just to complete one level that requires players to navigate in and out of dank passageways, burnt out rubble, and long forgotten city streets solving a series of intertwined puzzles.  Though admittedly marred by a somewhat lacking amount of texture detail at close ranges, (or as I like to refer to it, the ~I'm also a PS2 game~ bug) the game's liberal usage of polygons, shadowing, and color bring a game world depended on by its play mechanisms to an entirely new level of believability. As you trudge deeper and deeper into the cavernous, ominous black heart of the shaded wretched underbelly of a pristine city you'll not only be seized by the world's aesthetic luster, but by the immersion it creates.  Subtle details round out Eden's initial blast of design and color, such as the flashlight; a natural, realistic looking circular light that bends and melds with the environment, contorting to meet walls. Even those who pride themselves on technical detail, curvature, and outright texture quality found in various Quake 3 powered games will be hard pressed not to recognize and respect the meticulously crafted and cared for beauty that Eden brings with it.  These aesthetical factors set and maintain an ever-present unmistakable mood of apprehension, wonder and intrigue, and allow for genuine anticipation of what the next area will bring. This principle of graphics to further design and play will make the title's already robust play mechanics, and everything else found herein, that much more enjoyable.   Aurally, Eden does a fantastic job with background noises and sound effects, but some of the voice acting is a little suspect. Carter, your team leader, is the most egregious offender. His dialog is borderline Jake Lloyd. I'm talking the kind of, ~I want to repeatedly punch Anakin in the face and/or testicle~ annoying. A court wouldn't convict you of murder if you told them this drove you to it. The rest of your crew, Andre especially, as well as the various under life that you'll come across in your travels are all played out well and fit their parts to a tee. Thankfully you rarely have to put up with the spurts of dribble that come spewing from Dumb Ass's head (as he will from now on be referred).  Music? It's pretty much all background noise and heavy scary movie tones that touch up the atmosphere. The very fact that if there is more music than that and I can't remember it means it's great! Or at least never obtrusive, never annoying, albeit probably nonexistent.   The artistic mega-city, it's aural compliment, and the evolving, impending doom storyline are frightening attributes to a game that develops itself as not only a brainteaser, but a nerve rattler. It's not quite up to the bar set by System Shock 2's level of profound freakiness, but certainly no squad-based game before it can compete, that includes the eery Space Hulk of so many days past.   You'll spend the bulk of your time trying to figure out one logical compilation of puzzles in order to proceed to the next. Practically all of these puzzles are multi-tiered, and require several if not several dozen steps from the various characters to complete. I feel as if the word ~puzzle~ is a bit misleading in this context though, as games of past have typically thrown useless block pushing and switch throwing amalgamations at us and coined them ~puzzles.~ I think we've now all grown so weary of these that whenever the term is used we immediately revert to a defensive posture. So, for the sake of posterity I'm going to go ahead and refer to Project Eden's primary play mechanics as ~problems~ or ~challenges.~ It makes more sense this way, because the challenges that you'll face aren't merely an assortment of pushable boulders strategically positioned across a room. No, these are logical. A bit of common sense and perception are all that are required. The result is an immensely satisfying experience.   Seemingly simplistic and repetitive by design, the way in which these problems are strewn together in the aforementioned lush environments is a joy, regardless of whether you're muddling or breezing through them. Past the first few sets of challenges you'll quickly start to look at the world as if you were an actual UPA agent in the game. You'll take into account minor cracks, signs, windows, panels, vents and other miniscule things that would otherwise go unnoticed in other titles. Once again, the level design and style come into play. They are what bind these sets of challenges together and provide the logical basis for the problems at hand. It helps that they're all bleeding damn pretty.  There is some trial and error involved and there will assuredly be quite a bit of dying. In this respect, Eden once again shines. Project Eden isn't centered around number of lives, health, and continues like other games. There are actually Regen units dotted along the way, that once crossed, act as checkpoints for your characters. If one of your team meets an untimely end somewhere thereafter, they will respawn at the last Regen unit crossed. Even though you might think this defeats the purpose in progressing, it actually doesn't diminish the quality of the title. In trying to solve a problem, you'll find every fault resulting in death to merely be more assurance that a previously unexplored option may be the right one. The penalty for dying is minimal, and if you aren't content with relying on the checkpoint you can also quick save anywhere. Did I mention the quick loads are virtually instantaneous?   Character interaction is the method by which this problem solving comes about. The squad-based aspect of the game for the most part controls wonderfully. You can either switch between characters by simply pressing a bindable hotkey or by looking at the person whom you wish to control and clicking the left mouse button. This can be somewhat awkward in shootouts, and you will from time to time find yourself inadvertently switching to another character in an in opportune moment, but a little practice remedies this straight away. Getting your characters to follow you is also a snap, just hit the enter key and they'll all follow in an exact line behind you, it's certainly possible to lose them, but they will for the most part remain true to your course, even when you navigate over obstacles that require climbing. Besides, the in-game radar indicates where they are in relation to you by color-coded blips, so even if you do lose one you can just switch over to them instantaneously and move along.   In between the constant solving of problems you'll find a relatively weakly implemented combat system. The enemy AI range from passable to downright annoying. Baddies will rush back and forth, sneak, take cover, etc. but they do all of these things rather poorly: running into walls, trying to sneak away from you while you're in hot pursuit laying them out, etc. The tougher enemies are just that, and as the game progresses you'll have a more difficult time fending them off, too bad your compatriots are as equally inept at defending themselves. You'll often see the rest of your team facing completely opposite directions shooting at walls, running in jagged, indecisive steps as if they hadn't completely decided on their next course of action. Hmmm... Should I turn at shoot at the freaky monster or spin around and run into stuff?   Combat also isn't akin to a standard first-person shooter. For instance, in Red Faction, you more or less pump a few bullets into a guy and they go down. The trick there was that the game threw half a dozen or more of these intelligent guys at you simultaneously. Project Eden takes an opposite approach relying on splurts of small handfuls of opposition who take unnecessarily high amounts of damage. This subverts any intensity the action may have had and leads to a, ~I've been shooting you for ten minutes, why aren't you freaking dead already?~ kind of feeling.   There are a few other issues I took with the game. For one, the first-person view incorporates a viewable body, while nifty in premise, leads to some rather disorienting circumstances. Like, when you crouch and strafe to either side your character will roll, but when you do this in the first-person the effect remains the same, only you see a slight glitching of your body. This kind of thing happens occasionally. Again, in first-person mode, and again due to the viewable body, your arm obnoxiously sticks out when you fire. It would have been preferable if they had went with the standard fixed gun implementation found in the majority of shooters, or even if they opted to have no viewable weapon at all. Still, the very fact that there are both optional third and first-person views available is admirable. You can't really knock a game that lets you immediately do away with the problem, but still, the first-person could have benefited from a bit of improvement.  There're also a few hiccups in the game's collision detection system. Sometimes when walking you'll find yourself inadvertently climbing areas you did not want to, or falling off of areas you wanted to climb. Your character has an almost clumsy, RPG like feel at times and not the responsive agility of a Quaker. It's forgivable, but fixable.   Core has also seen fit to include a very comprehensive multiplayer component that includes, among other things, full cooperative play of the game's single player missions. The very nature of some of the levels require a lot of patience between players (certain characters are only suited for certain tasks and thus must wait for others to complete theirs before they may proceed), so playing with people you know to be committed to the game is an absolute must. The inclusion of this mode is commendable to say the least. In a day an age where single player games are quickly throwing in a mediocre multiplayer component as an afterthought, it's nice to see some effort put into it, especially in the area of cooperative play. Game designers, take a big fat note from Core, this is what people like.  So do Eden's highlights overcome its faults and annoyances? Oh, my yes. The experience of playing is genuinely enjoyable. It's one of those games that will consume your weekends and cause you to pause at work and daydream of the problems you've been having in the construction zone leading up to the Death Head's base.  Don't expect intense, nonstop action. But if you're coming in looking for a storyline rich in atmosphere and style, something bathed in immersion, something fresh, you will not be disappointed. God, I wish I would have sold my stock in the Real Meat company.  -- Ivan Sulic      Want to share your opinions with the world? Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  or send some mail to IGNPC about this story.  Like I say, it essentially boils down to a matter of taste.  Project Eden is not going to appeal to a great deal of gamers. Those are the folks who'll play Devil May Cry for the fast action or Metal Gear Solid 2 for all the cinematic gosh-wow.  If you're going to compare Eden to something on PlayStation 2 as far as style of gameplay, think ICO, but without the atmospherics.  It's similarly puzzle-intensive, and takes the cooperative aspects of ICO's design to an entirely new level.  The story actually makes sense, too -- everybody speaks one language.  Fancy that.Pick this one up, then, if you need an even more dense and complex adventure experience.  There's a lot of meat here, even if may be cooked a little tough for the average palate.", "date": "Oct 16, 2001"}
