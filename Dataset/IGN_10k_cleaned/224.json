While this probably doesn't matter to most of you (or you would have gone out and bought the damn game) there are quite a few PC gamers who have been pretty concerned about the future of the adventure game. After spending a couple of weeks with Infogrames' latest release, I think I can safely say that the time for worry is over. By combining movie quality art design, acting, plot and character development, and sound with a smooth action based engine, the company seems to have found a way to deliver all the impact of the best adventure games while keeping more casual gamers with sporadic bursts of frantic activity. Unfortunately, even though the game and its story development is nearly flawless, Outcast's actual graphics are so bad as to cause eye pain. Let's take a quick look at the good and bad behind this revolutionary release.  Let's go ahead and start with the graphics just to get that out of the way. To put it simply, Outcast is simultaneously one of the best looking games I've ever seen and one of the worst looking games I've ever seen. Let's start with the good. Outcast's artistic design, that is to say, the actual artwork that was created for the game, is some of the finest I've ever seen. Everywhere you turn you are presented with unbelievably beautiful images that make a bizarre alternate dimension seem absolutely real. I hate to drag out a point, but this game really has to be seen to be believed. The alien beings in the game have been depicted with amazingly lifelike physiologies and movement. The landscapes are crisp and well thought out  featuring lush forests, dangerous swamps, and deserts so real that you'll swear you can feel the heat. Even more impressive than the artistic skill with which all of this is portrayed though, is the exemplary creativity behind the creatures, people (well, the people are kind of creatures too) and vistas. Outcast is not just the standard new take on an existing mythology, this is an entirely new world that has been fully thought out with Tolkienesque detail.  ~So just what the hell is the problem,~ you're probably thinking by now. The problem is the technology used to bring all of this beautiful source art to your computer screen. With Outcast, Infogrames made the decision to step away from standard 3D-card technology and has instead created some sort of technical Frankenstein. While trying to get an idea of why my screen looked like someone had just smeared Vaseline all over it, I jumped over to the company's official Outcast web site and found the following statement. ~In order to truly enjoy a game in today's market, the characters must be designed to fit the game. Since Outcast is such a vast expanse of graphical detail and lush design, the models had to blend in as well. To accomplish this, Appeal has designed several cutting edge technologies. Outcast uses top quality rendering for characters using technologies such as real time skin deformation, real-time bump mapping, dual lighting and materials rendering. The end result is a smooth mixture of realistic world design and life-like creatures.~ Whatever. While it's obvious that the original rendering of the characters and objects in the game was done with advanced technology, the technique used to display them (a voxel based system) is utter crap. The end result is a cluttered mass of huge pixels displaying some of the most gorgeous original art I've ever seen. Whenever I watched a closeup of one of the characters in the game, I got the feeling that he was testifying against the Mob in an upcoming trial and his face was being blurred to protect him from assassination. Worse, because the original art was obviously so good, and because the displayed art is so blurry, I kept squinting at the monitor in an effort to make it look right. After about a two hours session I would have an amazing tension headache (okay, maybe the tension was from Tal trying out his new yo-yo right behind my head) and would have to quit. If the game's storyline hadn't been so absolutely engrossing, I would have given up after my first game.  But I didn't give up, true testament to the addictive power of Outcast's tremendous storyline. Night after night I would find myself playing the game to, ~just finish up this one goal~ and would find myself at work at 3:00am with no real knowledge that any time had passed. Here's the basic rundown  you are Cutter Slade (how do they think up these ultra tough names time and again?) the leader of a group of scientists assigned to enter an alternate dimension in order to stop a black hole that threatens the Earth. Along the way something goes wrong (big surprise) and you come to inside a small cabin with a terrible headache. Shortly after waking up you notice that the nice man who's home you're in isn't really a man at all, but some sort of really tall, biped... thing. He gives you a looooong spiel explaining how you came to your current location and what is currently wrong in the land. To make an amazingly long story short, he tells you that your visit has been spoken of in prophecy and that you must defeat an evil dictator that has taken over the land and free his people. You tell him that you'd love to help, but you're more interested in finding the rest of your team and completing your mission. After a little more verbal wrangling you finally agree to help him out and set off on your way to become a hero.  What really makes the game's story so addictive is the realistic way in which it unfolds. Each person you talk to knows a little bit about what's going on and is mostly interested in their own problems. By helping individuals out, you not only get them to help you towards your final goal, but you gain a reputation for being helpful and kind which in turn helps your future relations with others. Similarly, if you run around waving your gun at every Talan (oh yeah, the alien things are called Talan), you'll find it hard to get any info at all. By talking to different people, you'll eventually learn more and more about your situation and gain access to more areas. One thing that is kind of a pain in the ass about the setup though is that everyone in the game is referred to by these ridiculously long alien names. After you meet about three Talans, you'll realize that all of their names are really long and hard to remember which means that when you start questioning someone about someone else, you'll often have no idea who they're talking about. You do have a nice little information unit that keeps track of a lot of this for you, but it takes time to access and if you're as impatient as I am, you'll probably only look at every hour or so.  All of the characters in Outcast are brought alive by the game's terrific, movie-quality soundtrack and voice acting. The game's music was so impressive (and loud, see the second to last paragraph) that nearly everyone in the office came by at some time or another to ask what it was that was playing. Our art director liked the tunes so much that he asked me if a CD of the game's music was available for him to listen to at his desk. The quality of the voice acting is equally impressive with each of the different Talan boasting their very own voice (well, I'm sure there's some overlap, but not so as you'd notice). This, combined with the game's excellent dialogue (a lot of the guys thought that Cutter's dialogue was pretty goofy, but I really thought is was funny) will quickly make you forget that you're playing a video game.  The actual gameplay is a lot like Tomb Raider. You run around, looking at the world from a behind the back, third-person perspective. You start the game with a simple pistol (it's actually called a HK-P12, but let's just call it a pistol), but you have access to a total of six different weapons as the game goes on. Combat is fast and furious and the enemy AI is truly remarkable. Powerful enemies will rush you, counting on their strength to carry them through the situation, where lesser soldiers will take full advantage of cover and are actually quite good at side stepping your bullets when you shoot at them from a distance (I wish someone would tell me why we have really slow bullets in the future). Even animals get in on the act  at points in the game you'll run across groups of weird half-tiger, half-wolf critters called Gamors who will use pack tactics on you, attacking from different sides every time you look away. None of the combat is easy, but it's not really overwhelming either  even hardcore adventure game fans will probably find themselves digging the action after a brief warm-up period. The combination of protecting the innocents while shooting the bad guys adds a completely new element to this sort of game that I found very entertaining. Unfortunately for those who aren't into arcade games, there are also quite a few jumping and climbing puzzles that can get pretty damn annoying. Most of your time will be spent exploring the incredible rich (and vast) worlds of the game, talking to the inhabitants within, and that adventure game must have, carrying items from one place to another place.   Aside from the graphics, Outcast has a few other problems that are definitely worth mentioning. First off, the game seems a little bit buggy at times. You'll find traps resetting, doors locking, etc. At times when you restart from a save or perform some other out of the ordinary activity. This can be a tragic problem when you've used a unique item to open that door and then lost it inside the room that has now relocked itself. This same weirdness can show up during conversations with a Talan as well. Sometimes they'll look for a place to stand and waste a few minutes of your time walking back and forth, or worse yet, you'll pay them for an item and then won't be able to give it to you. The worst problem I had in this area was with a certain Talan not coughing up the appropriate conversation tree that was necessary for me to continue with the game. The second big problem is the camera angle, which often rapidly readjusts itself right in the middle of combat or during a complex jumping puzzle causing you to die unnecessarily. While this problem certainly isn't unique to this game, it can be very frustrating if you haven't saved in a while. Finally, the balance of voice sounds to music sounds is totally screwed up and there's no way to fix it. I kept turning up the volume to hear what someone was saying and then quickly turning it back down to avoid the blare of the powerfully loud soundtrack.  In the end (how many reviews am I going to finish with that line?), Outcast is a terrific new take on the adventure game with a lot of amazing breakthroughs in dialogue, AI and visual design, that I would recommend to just about anyone. While there's no doubt that it has its share of problems, the end play experience is worth the effort.  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Sep 10, 1999"}
