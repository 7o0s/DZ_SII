You hear the comparisons all the time  if it's not a tile-shifting puzzle game like Tetris, it's a task puzzle game like Lemmings. It seems like the original game has been brought to every system ever conceived, and Lemmings is officially brought to the 21st century with Take 2's Game Boy Color rendition. But there's problems  design and technical issues eliminate many of the elements that gave the original design all of its charm and playability. The Game Boy Color version isn't terrible, but it's not nearly as sadistically cute or exciting as it once was. Features Both Lemmings and Oh No, More Lemmings! More than 150 levels Battery save Only for Game Boy Color  Lemmings are these cute, green-hair, Muppet looking critters (think Mokey from Fraggle Rock). Problem is, they've got no brains, capable only of walking left or right without being directed otherwise  if left unassisted, they'll wander off a cliff to their death. It's up to you to work with these Lemmings to get them to the exit of each level  this is done by giving them specific tasks. Make a Lemming a Blocker and he'll stop in his tracks, hold up his arms, and prevent other Lemmings from walking past his spot. Builders are used to create staircases over gaps and up walls to allow other Lemmings access to higher points. Climbers will scale walls, Bashers will plow through blocks, Diggers will scoop a path in the earth, and Fallers will gently fall to the ground with the assistance of an umbrella. The trick is to utilize these tasks in combination so that a certain percentage of Lemmings will make it out of the level alive  some Lemmings will have to bite it. It's inevitable. All you have to worry about is the quota per each round. Lemmings on the Game Boy Color actually a two-pack of all the levels that were introduced in the original Amiga classic, along with the add-on pack released a year later, Oh No! More Lemmings. There are almost 170 levels in this battery-backed up cartridge, so if you're looking for a game that'll last you a long time... this is it.  The Game Boy Color version simulates the design as well as it can, which unfortunately doesn't bode well for the portable rendition. The original game featured several tiny, but well-animated sprites representing the Lemmings creatures. The Game Boy Color can't handle a ton of moving objects, which means the design has to be scaled back  Lemmings are spread apart, and there are fewer of them per level. This eliminates the maniacal pace of the original PC versions on the Nintendo handheld, removing half the fun that the game is supposed to offer. Plus, some of the levels are a real chore because of the technical limitations  since you can't increase the speed of the critters (an option in nearly every other version of Lemmings), you'll have to sit and wait for the slow, straying Lemmings to get back on the path.    Not only that, but there are many instances where the ~character~ of the Lemmings critters have been removed because of technical reasons. There's no ~Let's Go!~ digitized sample at the beginning of the game, nor are there the classic ~Oh, No!~ sound clips when you tell the Lemmings to blow up. And in several levels, there are unique contraptions that'll kill a Lemming if they wander next to them  these things still kill a Lemming in the Game Boy Color version, but the death lacks the awesomely funny animations that were in the original Amiga game. It's just not satisfying to watch a Lemming explode without the particle effects... perhaps that's asking a bit too much out of the 8-bit hardware.  At least the developer worked a decent interface to control the game into this version  the original design required a mouse for its point-and-click gameplay. On the Game Boy Color version, you still maneuver a cursor around the screen, but selecting a task for a Lemming is as simple as tapping the B button to scroll through the selections. And you can do this while the game's paused, which is really handy when the action gets a little too hectic to handle.  I miss the huge mob of Lemmings wandering towards their doom. I miss the particle effects of a Lemmings explosion. I miss the character voices during the game. I miss the clever animations of some of the specific Lemmings deaths. And I miss a cool Lemmings introduction that's been included in nearly every version of the game since it began on the Amiga. Lemmings is still a fun puzzle game, but the Game Boy Color version is completely devoid of life and character, and the technical limitations are enough to stray away from these portable critters. Want a great version to take on the go? The Atari Lynx version is still the tops. Perhaps Take 2 can port the Amiga version to the Game Boy Advance next year... but today, the GBC can't cut it.", "date": "Dec 19, 2000"}
