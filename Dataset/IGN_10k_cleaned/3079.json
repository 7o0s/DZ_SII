TDK's past two portable games featuring the Dreamworks/PDI ogre, Shrek: Fairy Tale Freakdown and Shrek: Swamp Kart Speedway were two of the lamest offerings on the systems they were released on. Three's a magic number, so they say, and the third portable Shrek design, Shrek: Hassle at the Castle for the Game Boy Advance, is actually a suprisingly decent title on the handheld. This game's not going to win any awards for its originality, but it's obvious that this Shrek game wasn't farted out just to capitalize on a license...TDK gave the project to a team that's finally given the ogre his rightful videogame props. Features 24 levels Four playable characters Link cable support for four players (single and multicartridge link) Cartridge save (three slots) Only for Game Boy Advance Shrek: Hassle at the Castle is a simplistic side-scrolling action platform design that follows the movie's plot almost to a T...abridging actual movie scenarios and adding new elements to make the movie fit better in this videogame layout. Players start out as Shrek and move through the movie's story, beginning with exterminating his swamp free of those pesky villagers. Not too far down the road you'll have to save Donkey from evil knights, duke it out with an army of guards in Duloc's yard, and rescue the princess from the Dragon's Tower and escape from the pursuing gigantic lizard. The game's finale is with the evil, short Lord Faarquad as he attempts to wed the princess. There's even a few nods to elements from the movie, from the scorched knight in the castle to the entire level dedicated to blowing up a bird with Fiona's singing. The deeper you go in the game, you're sometimes given the opportunity to switch characters. Shrek's strong but slow, Donkey's quick but weak, and Fiona's got speed and strength.  While the game seems to focus on Final Fight-style brawling early in the game, Hassle at the Castle evolves more toward action-platformer as you progress through the 24 different levels.  This action title's obviously being tailored for the younger crowd, with the graphic style and the basic control layout that only spans the A and B buttons; the L and R buttons aren't even used. This control issue is a little strange, considering that each character has a special, screen-clearing supermove that can be performed by pushing the A and B buttons together. It would have been a lot more intuitive to get that move off the button combination and onto a single button, like the shoulder buttons. But even though the game's aim is the kid demographic, Hassle at the Castle actually picks up in difficulty towards the end of the game; the last few areas of Hassle are almost at the Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts level of challenge, difficulty and frustration. Almost. And even though you may blow through the game on its normal difficulty in about three hours, the game's not truly over until you've switched the option setting to its significantly more challenging ~Advanced~ setting.  Another nifty addition is the fun little mini-game called ~Fight~ that puts up to four players in an enclosed side-scrolling arena. Players need to collect coins as they roll out of the four corners of the area...and knocking coins out of the possession of the opponents. The player with the most coins when the time runs out is the winner. This little multiplayer game is best when you've got a copy of the game for each system involved, but for a quick pick up game, it supports single-cartridge multiplayer. Believe it or not, this game's been developed by the same Japanese team that worked on Nintendo's own quirky little platformer, The Legend of Starfi. Hassle at the Castle was an absolute relief to boot up on the GBA, considering the quality of the past two crappy Shrek games I had to endure on the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance. This side-scroller is not an amazing design by any stretch, but it's extremely solid with enough challenge and variety for the casual gamer to enjoy.", "date": "Oct 18, 2002"}
