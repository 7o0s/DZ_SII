Panty Raider: From Here to Immaturity, brought to us by the marketing gurus at Simon & Schuster Interactive, is the game that everybody loves to hate.  In the wake of its release, feminist groups are fuming, industry leaders are shaking their heads in disgust, and half the IGN staff was court-ordered to undergo sensitivity training.  But political correctness has no damn business loitering around my reviews, capiche?  So loosen your collar, unstarch that shirt, and join me as I go where no man has boldy gone before - into a supermodel's skivvies.  Oh man, is the galactic irony beyond belief.  A lingerie catalogue was accidentally delivered to a trio of hornball aliens, who've taken a shine to the contents.  And faster than the production guys can cue the ~boi-oi-oing~ sound effects, they've decided to pay Earth a little visit.  Our extraterrestrial friends, who look like backup singers from the band that played Jabba's palace, are jonesing for more racy shots.  But instead of just picking up an issue of Hustler (can you really blame 'em?), they've enlisted the help of a geeky dude named Nelson to snap the photos they crave.  If he fails in his quest, Earth goes boom, and so the drama unfolds...  The master plan is magnificent in its Beavis and Butthead-esque scope.  Three locations - the beach, jungle, and ruins - must be combed for three randomly chosen models in three different sets of undergarments (notice a pattern here?).  Nelson's most important job is to zoom about the areas using the arrow keys and lure the babes out into the open.  But supermodels don't frolic about half-naked for anybody, except yours truly.  To draw the elusive ~babe~ out of hiding, Nelson has to use a limited supply of pick up lines and bait. Have fun wasting brain cells as you comb the levels while shrieking ~Everyone under 100lbs into the pool!~ and ~There's a party in my pants and everybody's invited,~ tossing toilet bowls, tic-tacs, mirrors and gold cards about as you go.  OK, there's a girl in your sights, but some idiotic intern painted her clothes on...now what?  Located at the bottom of the screen is a little bag of tricks, which includes x-ray glasses, garment-destroying goop, and a camera.  First, you have to scan girls with the peepers to see if they're wearing the right draws.  If not, they'll run off in a huff, but if so, we move on to phase two of our nefarious scheme.  Using the goop, you'll have to disintegrate the supermodels' clothing piece by piece until they're sufficiently declothed for pictorial purposes.  The girls don't take very kindly to this proposition, forcing you to lob gobs of goo at them in a target shoot as they run back and forth across the screen.  Afterwards comes the picture, which can be taken by holding the camera viewscreen over the damsel in distress while she bolts for her foxhole (so I couldn't resist a pun, sue me).  And voila, there you have it, bucko.  Random goombas like a foul-mouthed old woman and aggravating metalhead show up to jerk you around, but they don't have much of an impact on play.  Nelson's got a health meter to watch out for, though the only way you can deplete it is to goop the wrong models or  declothe the old bat and moshmeister.  The only hazard that bears mention is the clock, which is constantly ticking down.  Grab the three photos you need within the alotted time and you'll be treated to a movie, followed by a chance to restart.  Fail to do so and a depressing movie plays, again followed by a chance to start over.  Yes, the 'game' can be won in less than fifteen minutes.  Humor's supposed to be the draw, as evidenced by the many voice clips.  Nelson blabbers on about how sad his social life is and the trio of aliens (who sound like Cheech, Chong, and a surfer dude) won't shut up.  ~I didn't come here to look at the wrong underwear, man~ says one.  ~If you can't win a model's heart, buy it with a gold card,~ yaps another.  ~#$#% the programmer who forgot to code in a retort button,~ yelps the disgruntled game reviewer.  Even the models have a few choice words to say, though they set the women's lib. movement back a few hundred years.  Twenty minutes in and it's off the sound goes.  Without the jokes or controversial subject matter, Panty Raider would be pure and utter crap.  But why settle for being crap when you can shoot for ~laughing stock of the video game world?~  Several readers have posed querstions about what could possibly have possessed Simon and Schuster to make them poop on their principles and unleash this monstrosity onto the unsuspecting world.  Duh!  They did it all for the nookie.  -- Scott Steinberg", "date": "Jun 3, 2000"}
