This commonly known truth is further engraved in stone with Superbike 2000, the latest 2-wheeled racer from the kings of PC sports titles.  While not entirely flawless, this sim certainly doesn't leave too much to be desired.   Eager gamers will promptly be greeted by an array of scrolling colors or flash white screens as soon as they start up.  After canceling out of the program and downloading the absolute newest video drivers for your system, you can get underway.    For those who just want to slam on the gas and tear down the tarmac with the default game settings, the option to Quick Start is available from the very first menu.  As for those of us who enjoy a little custom designing, just about everything you can think of is adjustable here.  Players can choose from a cadre of world class riders if they're unhappy with the designer's choices.  In the souped up moped department, 6 scream machines are furnished for your driving pleasure including such popular name brands as Kawasaki and Ducati.  Furthermore, if selecting your own bike isn't good enough for you, the interface allows for a generous amount of tweaking, thereby ensuring countless hours of tinkering to find those perfect specs.  Combining these features with 13 circuits to rip through a full-on championship mode, this makes for a pretty nice package.  However, it's the extra options available in this title that make it worthwhile.  Of course, the necessary availability of control type is offered, allowing for the use of the keyboard, joystick, or gamepad peripherals.  Furthermore, nearly every imaginable level of computer assistance can be modified to your heart's content.  Increased breaking power, aided speed control, ideal racing lines, and a multitude of other helpful goodies await those who would care to try them out.  The game's difficulty level incorporates these settings turning some alternatives on and others off, however users can alter the presets to their liking.  So, beginners (or those who just enjoy throwing realism to the wind) can augment their chances, while veterans can further increase the challenge by turning off all of these wonderful little extras.  Once on the track, things really start to look slick.  Make no mistake, the level of graphical detail can most likely take your personal setup to the max, but only if you wish it to do so.  Like everything else in the game, you can tell the engine just how much of your system resources you want it to siphon off.  Resolution, ambient effects, pop-up distance, and other selections help make certain that older machines (but not that much older mind you) will still be able to run this puppy.  However, those with beast machines are free to turn up the juice.  When this is done...well, the screens speak for themselves. Though occasionally a few glitches appear in the track, for the most part what you see here is how solid things look throughout the experience.  There is roughly zero slowdown even in a packed house of CPU opponents, and any shifting in online games is due solely to lag (as is often the case).  One of the few things that does strike an odd chord in the graphics department are the crash sequences.  When the option for realistic skin peelers is turned on, things are pretty much as one would expect.  The fallen rider picks himself and his bike up from the track, wheels the cycle back onto the path, and then gets underway.  However, with this choice set to off, things get really unrealistic.  Almost immediately after hitting the pavement, the screen flips for a moment and our friendly neighborhood motorcycle guy is back atop his hog, on the track and ready to go.  Though this tactic seems to be designed to make the likely event of a crash less of a factor in gaining a winning position, it still feels a bit too jerky when laid next to how smoothly the other ~assistance effects~ translate into a race.   Cranking up the speakers, riders will discover a pretty good album of rock and techno beats to help keep things moving.  The music choices are at least decent and often better than just average.  The effects are equally as convincing as the visuals thus further enhancing the genuine feeling this title bestows upon players.  However, not all is happy-go-lucky in the world of Superbike 2000 sound.  The ear plug award goes to the race commentator whose sharp voice cuts in at varying moments during any contest (usually in a crash situation).  Thankfully, EA of course included yet another option to silence these piercing vocals.  Despite its few flaws, Superbike 2000 belongs in any enthusiasts' collection.  Rock solid graphics and a sweet musical score combined with as many settings as you can shake a stick at make for a fantastic racing experience for anyone interested in the genre.  So, for those with a fetish for blasting down a straightaway at breakneck speed while also cutting down on hospital bills and limb replacements, this is most likely a good one for you.  -- Rich Rouse", "date": "Mar 21, 2000"}
