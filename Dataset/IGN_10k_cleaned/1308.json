{"name": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", "name_review": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/04/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-3", "text": "Back in May, I got an early taste of Buffy the Vampire Slayer when THQ showed off a pre-alpha demo at the Electronic Entertainment Expo -- I was not amused, especially when all there was to the game was punch-punch-kick-stab one vampire after another.  But I did the right thing by reserving judgement until the game was completed -- and now it is. I can think of other torturous tasks I'd much rather be doing than enduring another level of Buffy the Vampire Slayer -- watching the WB Networks new fall line-up in one sitting, for example... Features Eight levels of one-on-one vampire battles Unintentional one-button gameplay Password save just in case you actually want to return to this game for some reason. Only for Game Boy Color   Side-scrolling beat-em-ups such as Final Fight and Streets of Rage are generally mindless and get old quickly, but the developers of this game (GameBrains) managed to make the genre an absolute annoyance and chore to play through. Never have I seen so much lack of imagination go into a game design. Playing this game is like reading shampoo directions -- you walk, you beat up a vampire, you kill a vampire, you do it again. Wash, rinse, repeat.  And that's no exaggeration, either. The whole game design puts you, as Buffy, on the streets of Sunnydale, strolling along until *wham!* a vampire leaps out of the darkness. You can use a backlog of moves like sweeps, punches and kicks, but all you really have to do is hit the A button to whittle the vampire down until he's on his back. Then it's all just a matter of walking over to his chest and pressing down with the A button to drive a stake into his heart to defeat him. Then, you stroll along again until *wham!* another vampire leaps out of the darkness. And the game's as predictable as a one-digit lottery -- where ever there's an open door, window, or gap in a fence, you'll find a vampire popping out of it.  But what's worse is the fact that it's always a one-on-one battle. You'll never, ever, ever fight more than one vampire at a time -- you'd think that the vampires would learn to double-team you or something, but nope. I lost interest by the second level, but I continued all the way to the end in one sitting -- forget it, there's as much variety in this eight-level game as there is in a ten-pound bag of Holiday M&Ms.  While the in-game artwork is above-average, the cutscene ~comic book style~ is downright hideous. People watch Buffy because Sarah Michelle Geller is relatively hot -- but the artist here made her Game Boy Color counterpart butt-ugly in the intermissions. Yeesh! Awful. Awful, awful, awful. And that's all I have to say about Buffy the Vampire Slayer. You've been warned.", "date": "Oct 4, 2000"}
