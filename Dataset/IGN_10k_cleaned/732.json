It's both fast in speed and in how long it takes for you to play the game  it's over before it begins. Roadsters is like the rice cake of the Game Boy Color library  there's a bit of substance, but there's just not much to it. And like a ricecake, you'll find better uses for Roadsters than what it was made for -- Ricecake: coaster, Roadsters: Game Boy system dust protector. Features 12 tracks Password save Game Boy Printer support For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  When you look at what console gamers are going to get with their versions of Roadsters, Game Boy Color owners are going to feel cheated. There's no selection of cars, only three drivers to choose from (none of which offer any advantages over the other), a total of 12 races...and that's it. Once you've blown through the game's 12 tracks, the game's over. I'm not kidding  I went from start to finish with Roadsters in 45 minutes. And there wasn't even any payoff at the end  just a static ~Game Over~ screen at the finish line of the final race. Why on earth does the game need a password for a game that ends so quickly?   The challenge to get there starts out pretty well  like I mentioned above, the game moves FAST. The 3D effect is very similar to the other behind-the-vehicle racers, but then you realize the game offers absolutely no variety in the way of track design. The world is as flat as a pancake  there aren't any hills to drive over, no jumps...only left turns and right turns. Roadsters is simply a game very similar to Activision's Enduro on the Atari 2600 where you do nothing but avoid wave after wave of slow-moving traffic. You're only up against seven other vehicles, but they're intermixed with this traffic. And you never even see the finish line approaching  the race ends when the counter on the top of the screen goes from 100% to 0%. Whatever position you were in when the counter reaches 0% is the place you're given  and you're awarded cash based on your position, which can then be exchanged into upgrades for your vehicle. But since the game ends before it can begin, you'll never really use the cash other than to fix your vehicle from the frequent bumps and grinds you get in every race.   And it has to be said  this game has the worst sound effects for a racing game...ever. The revving engine sounds more like a pursuing cop car  which is totally misleading, since there's a police car in the game trying to pull you over. The squeaks and squeals of the engine and tires were so high-pitch that folks on the other side of the office looked around to see what was making that noise. And this was with the volume turned low.  Ironically, Enduro  the game released almost two decades ago on an extremely weak system  is easily the better game.  I really wanted to like Roadsters. The game impressed with its FMV introduction and super-fast pseudo-3D engine...but then I realized that the tracks never ever changed, nor did they offer anything more than right and left turns  no hills. It's just a game of avoid the traffic.  The game feels totally unfinished  just looking at the available upgrades for your vehicle is indication enough that the game went out the door before its time. Snow tires? Never once saw any snow to use them on. There are plenty of racing games available on the Game Boy better than Roadsters  the series is going to be good on the consoles, but we Game Boy players got completely gypped with a bland, unfinished racer.", "date": "Feb 24, 2000"}
