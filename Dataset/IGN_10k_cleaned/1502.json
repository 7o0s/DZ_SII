The original game on the system had a couple good ideas but the execution made the title barely average, and we hoped the sequel would learn from that game's mistakes. And while the sequel as a few weird quirks that bring the game down a few notches, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is a very enjoyable design that's deserved of the Tony Hawk namesake. Features 12 professional skaters, including Tony Hawk  Seven locations to skate  Password save (Printer Support) Only for Game Boy Color  Last year's version was nothing more than a flawed top-down racing game with a half-pipe minigame attached to it. The original handheld version didn't have anything to bring fans of the PlayStation, N64, and Dreamcast title over to the portable edition. This time around,  Natsume (the developers of the original and this version) actually looked at the console versions and based its design around elements that could actually convert over to the Game Boy Color. Obviously a 3D engine is completely out of the question on the hardware, but there's more to Tony Hawk than clever camera angles. The game's design was always about performing tricks and completing tasks, and the Game Boy Color sequel manages to move the elements that made the console Tony Hawk such a fun game to play.   Each of the levels in this game are based on the skate parks in the console sequel  the airport hangar, New York City, the school yard  if you've already thrashed through the videogame version, the GBC version will feel right at home. There are two different style of skateparks  side-scrolling, and overhead, pseudo-3D layouts. The sidescrolling parks emphasize halfpipes and jumps, whereas the overhead mode encourages object grinding. Each park has a certain quota to meet, and each task in the quota will earn you some money that can be used to unlock other skateparks or purchase a better board.  Some tasks are easier than others  performing a five-combo trick, earning more than 5,000 points, grinding over all taxicabs in the city. Others are a little more obscure and require some serious thinking  collecting the letters S, K, A, T, and E is one of the more rudimentary tasks to complete in the console versions, but here it's one of the toughest things to do. Only when you complete these tasks will you earn enough money to move on to the locked skateparks.  While there are two different modes of play to add variety to the fun game, neither mode is perfect. The side-scrolling mode is very similar to what Wayforward did in Xtreme Sports' skateboarding levels, but you get more control in Tony Hawk Unfortunately, controls are somewhat restrictive  if you jump and land on anything rail-like, your character will automatically grind whether you wanted to or not. Grinding is a big deal in Tony Hawk, and there's no way you can avoid grinding  this is an option that should have been mapped to the B button, since this button is used to decide which grind your character will perform when in the air. In the console version, you had to tell it when you wanted to grind by tapping a button  it would have made the game feel a lot more like the console edition if this control scheme was followed on GBC.  In the overhead mode, the screen will scroll up, down, left and right  the skateparks are huge in this mode. But the issue here is control  you can't conveniently roll up or down, only being able to move at an angle to the upper or lower parts of the park. This mode should have used MTV Sports: Skateboarding as a model, since this game knew how to offer freedom of movement and supply jumps and grinds while doing it.  The biggest problem is the fact that you never really know you've completed a task until the time's up and the checklist pops up. In the console version, as you collect specific items or come close to meeting the item in the quota list, text pops up to let you know when you've performed a necessary task. In the Game Boy Color version, you get no such ~warning.~ So, for example, if you're trying to complete the ~grind all planters~ quota, you're never given proper info as you mark each planter in the park. It may seem like a small complaint, but trust me  when you want to complete multiple tasks in one shot, you'll really want to know that you're actually on your way doing the things that need to be done.  The one element from the original Tony Hawk that could have made a great addition in the sequel is link-cable mode, but the developers didn't include it this time around. Console versions of Tony Hawk 2 offer an extremely cool ~graffiti~ two player game where doing tricks on jumps and objects will claim those areas  this could have been done in the Game Boy Color version...but it wasn't. It's a small complaint  since the developers did a great job capturing the console feel on the handheld,  it's not hard to want the other things that didn't make the translation.  Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 on the Game Boy Color  is a much better skateboarding game than the original version that was released earlier this year. The same development company responsible for the first portable Tony Hawk Pro Skater improved the design in nearly every conceivable way in this decent sequel, creating a very enjoyable and playable shreddin' title for the system. There are still some serious issues in gameplay in the new production, but it was a pleasure and relief to see how much the game had improved since its first incarnation back in March. No one's perfectly captured the essence of the console skateboarding title on the handheld yet, but Tony Hawk 2 is a few steps closer.", "date": "Nov 18, 2000"}
