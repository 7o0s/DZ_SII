Always a master technician when it comes to physics engines and simulation, the English company once known for its Game Genie has created a Colin McRae to be proud of in this generation. Not that Colin McRae Rally 3 or Colin McRae Rally 4 were bad, they weren't, but they were disappointing.    With Colin McRae Rally 2005, Codies has mixed things up a little with a different progression scheme, added beautiful graphic touches, and has engineered the game to work online. The result is a hefty single-player game that enables you to choose a slew of cars, upgrade them along the way, and to race in what seems to be the largest collection of courses in the series. What gamers also et is the best rally simulation in North America (its biggest UK competitor being World Rally Championship 04) with a massive single-player, offline campaign, and an unusual but adrenaline-pumping online mode. It's the best Colin package of them all, that is if you're willing to let go of the greatness that was Colin McRae Rally 2.0. But are you willing?   Gameplay  If you've played Colin McRae Rally before, you won't be surprised with this one. Colin McRae Rally 2005 is a rally simulation, built from the ground up with a superb physics engine, and an attention to detail that's hard to match in almost any racing game. It's not an arcade game like RalliSport Challenge 2.0, meaning it's not as easy to get into, not as easy to play, and while it has a good assortment of options, cars, and courses, it's not as big of a game as Microsoft's title. And it's a far better rally game than you'll get in Gran Turismo 3: A-spec, which to be fair is pretty darn fun in its own right. But if you want the closest rally racing videogame experience in the North American market, this is it.    This year's version, like an old Capcom Street Fighter game, is better in small and subtle increments. But it's been rearranged in a significantly subtle way that makes it far better than previous iterations. The most noticeable additions are seen in the game's progression scheme, which, for the first time has drastically changed. And because of the way this progression chart is designed, you'll be paying far more attention to the maintenance and the setup of you car in each race.     Players are given a slew of modes to choose from, Career, Championship, Challenges, and Xbox Live. Championship enables you to take on the role of Colin McRae himself and engage in a one-off championship (for one to two players). Challenges is set up for stage or rally races, which you can play in single-player mode or with other racers. Xbox Live enables you to jump into a stages or rally races with as many as eight players in total. I'll get more into the online component of Colin in a second. Career has always been the traditional meat and potatoes of the series, and it's no different here. But unlike Colin 3, which short-sightedly restricted you to only playing as Colin McRae in the Ford Focus, here you earn right to drive 30 wildly different cars, each one unlocking in a non-linear format that switches up as many as 23 events throughout its entirety. It's easily a 20-30-plus hour single-player mode.      Normally, you'd jump into Career, pick a car and then progress from country to country. You'd play through five stages of England, four stages of Sweden, or dive into South Africa, Australia or Greece, and then stay there until you'd beaten that section, and then you'd progress to the next country. Here, you enter into Career, start off in a series or event, which comprises anywhere from four to eight countries, each one broken into distinct segments, and once it's done with one, you're off to another country. As a US gamer, I'm not certain that this is how rally racing normally works, but I'm pretty sure it's not (it's be awful expensive if it is). If having played Colin McRae for all these years is any indication, then it's not. So, though not realistic, this setup is not only different, but it's actually more interesting, and more significantly, more fun than Colin 3 or Colin 4.   The re-alignment of the stages in this manner produces a few effects. First, the variety of courses is constant, so you're getting a taste of almost everything in your very first event. Realistic or not, this produces a wonderfully fulfilling sense of wholeness. You're instantly given variety and challenge on a number of fronts. Sure, in the first couple of championship opens you'll be in a rather crappy car (the VW Polo), but after your first win, you earn another new car, and another, etc. After my first two hours, I'd earned  the MG ZR, the Escort Cosworth, the VW Beetle RSi, the Celica GT-Four, and more.    Second, the events (Cups, Shields, Challenges, SuperCups, and Championhips) are classified and presented in a non-linear form, a little like those in Gran Turismo. There are 2WD series, 4WD series, special single-car series (such as the Escort Mk1 Anglo Shield or the Beetle RSi Atlantic series), the 4X4 platinum series, and legends rallies. The events clearly indicate what kind of car you need, and you'll easily catch on as to how to get in them. There are also more than 300 stages in all, which is to say, a whole freakin' lot.     Third, just like in Colin McRae Rally 4, there are a handful of upgrades in each series. Though you can only upgrade these after you've won the series, these little mini-games are fun and rewarding. You can upgrade your exhaust system by heating up your pipe and maintaining it through a single race against time. Or you can improve your gearbox in a test run which challenges you to hit different gear speeds in a timed fashion. There is no limit to how many times you can try, and once you've upgraded that part, it shows up on a menu indicating it's been improved. You can upgrade your gearbox, exhaust, dampers, brakes, engine, suspension and more.    Fourth, each time you win a series, you'll earn driver points. These points accumulate over the course of your career, and as you reach higher levels, you'll open the harder series. These points not only open up new series, they unlock new cars every time you reach a new milestone (15, 30, etc.). In this way, you're being rewarded for your single event achievements, and overall in the big picture.      In the process of this reorganization, drivers will also be required to pay a lot more attention to the courses themselves and the amount of damage they're taking. For each race you can A) Repair your car (with a similar time-based style); B) Thanks to a tweaking of the menu you can more efficiently check the info on the course (whether it's raining, what the turns are like, what the height and surface conditions are, etc.), and C) Adjust your car to that course. You'll be doing this a whole lot more because in each meet you may race in up to nine different countries, from Australia to Sweden, Germany, Greece, the US, Japan, Spain, Finland, and the UK. Again, it's not like you couldn't do this in the previous game, but you'll need to pay more attention to these changes each and every race to succeed. Actually, unlike last year, you won't get a shakedown opportunity before each race, but you will be able to check your car's damage between each one.   The courses themselves are ingeniously designed, with excellent small touches. You'll see large rocks in distinctly mean places, small logs and hitch posts in perfectly evil places, too. The sense of texture, meaning the surface you're driving on is also significantly dealt with. You'll know when you're on smooth snow, grass, wet or light gravel or when you're in deep water. Oh, and the nice addition of the car icon on your screen helps to show which parts of your car are taking damage really helps you as you drive.    So, in short, the shaken up progression scheme is great, a huge payoff for Codemasters, but more significantly, for gamers. You'll earn more cars, drive in more rally races, earn all sorts of chances for upgrades, get the chance to progress in a non-linear way, and visit more countries than in any previous Colin (or at least you'll feel like you did).    Online  Now, what's this online business all about? The Xbox Live mode is new to the series and in many ways it's excellent. The main way that's its excellent is that you can finally play Colin McRae online. That you can actually play it and it functions is a watershed. Last year, you had leaderboards, but this year you can play with as many as seven other people in a slew of online courses. Now, after the exhilaration wears off a bit, there are a few good points about the online experience, and some pretty significantly worrisome ones.     First, you can choose three match types, OmniMatch, Quick Match, or Create Session. Quick Match is the easiest to get in and play. I joined several rallies and raced against a bunch of very good players who made few to no mistakes in each of the races while maintaining significant speed. The Quick Match leads from course to course, giving you the chance to turn on or off the co-pilot, voices, and effects, and the choice to select from a basic set of cars.    OmniMatch enables you to tweak several settings and options, from the amount of players (again, up to eight), slots for friends, damage (normal to heavy), game type (rally or stages), car classification (2WD, 4WD, Rear WD, Front WD, classics, etc.), and world rating (displays your world ranking). Create Session gives you this same set of options as Ominmatch, but you're the leader and the host.      Traditionally, rally racing is not against a car at all, it's against time. So the idea of eight racers on-screen and online, is, in its essence, breaking all the rules. Here, a bit of purity was thrown out the window so you could play the game online. Fair enough. That out of the way, Codemasters set up online play to do several things well, and has mostly succeeded. It's clear the dev team wanted to preserve the core elements of the Colin McRae Rally experience, while willing to give up others, and as a developer making games online, you'll have to give up something. Codemasters tried to keep A) the sense of physics that's so central to the series; B) the game's visuals and framerate; and C) the highly focused single-player sensation of control. All of these things have been retained well. In the several sessions that I played, the framerate was good, the game rarely if ever lagged, and the sense of control was not compromised.    What aspects are compromised, however, consist of the look, sensation, and relationship you'll have with the other cars on the track. First, the other cars appear as ghosts, single-color shades of rally cars, with the name of the driver above them. They aren't solid, so you can drive right through them -- and them through you. The several connections I had revealed the biggest gripe, which is that they'll appear with tremendous lag on your screen. Your car won't lag at all, but they will make almost strobe-light appearances, flashing on and off the TV screen in a way that's actually distracting. It's not terrible, but it is distinctly distracting. Third, the ability to hear other drivers was almost entirely broken. I tried several different connections and several different races, and the sound of other people talking to me was almost inaudible. Hopefully, that's not what other people experience, but it was my consistent experience with a box copy.    Thus, the online races aren't as robust as I would have liked. The other cars are not physically bumping against you in a real sense, though, that might have been terrible on these courses. But you will feel that competitive itch by seeing them and wanting to get first place. The lobbies are pretty straightforward, the load times are better than reasonable (less than 15 seconds), and for the most part, it's pretty amazing to simply play this game online. Plus, the World Ranking System is cool. But the stripped down sense of things (no personally upgraded cars) and no car adjustments before a race could also make one feel a little disappointed.    Graphics  Visually, Colin McRae Rally 2005 is a superb game. Colin McRae Rally 3 and Colin McRae Rally 4 were also superb looking, but Colin 2005 trumps them all with an assortment of small artistic touches that really make this one shine.    There is an emphasis on soft focuses here, where close up objects look in focus and far-off objects are slightly blurred. This effect lends a great sense of depth, and it also smoothes out what was considered CMR3 and CMR4's biggest glitch, shimmering.    The cars themselves are perfectly modeled, and all of the excellent special effects from last year's iteration are back, from the particle sparks when scraping up against walls, to the splash of water on the windshield, to the handful of broken glass textures on your car windshield. Of course, the damage model is still awesome, so you'll see all parts of your car broken off, splintered, shattered, or crushed. You'll also get five superb viewpoints, three from in the car and two from behind. The only weak parts are the weirdly artistic trophy menus. I guess they're better than some clonky looking women handing you a trophy, but they somehow feel a little lackluster.    Sound  The sound is superb. The amount of recording that Codemasters must have done undoubtedly adds up to hundreds of hours. Each car, each gear shift, red line, crash, and all of the surfaces sound different and very, very real.    Nicky Grist is back as the co-pilot, and so that's also a big plus. And is it just me, or does he actually read off more turns in a row than before? I occasionally felt like he was reading off so many turns ahead of time that I couldn't keep up   As with other Colin games, there is no music in the racing portion of the game, but during the other sections, you'll hear smooth original techno that's enjoyable and not in any way irritating.The thing I notice again and again about the Colin McRae Rally series is that it requires a distinct sense of focus. And once you delve into it and get the feel of the game, you'll feel yourself riding along with a particular sense of rhythm and with a distinct sense of flow that is unlike any other game I've played. Colin McRae Rally 2005 is a very good racer in this series, and in many ways, and because of its break from tradition, it's one of my favorites, and in my opinion, one of the best of the series. The reorganization of the career mode produces a superb effect, the range of cars and courses is wonderfully overwhelming, and the overall feel is one of having just bought a treasure chest of rallying racing. Also, heck, for $29.99? What an unbelievable steal. For those who love Rallisport Challenge 2 and who perhaps want a bigger challenge, this game will bring it. It's less arcade-like and harder, to be sure, especially the later stages of the Career mode, than Rallisport Challenge 2, but it's also a different game, one that's an excellent contrast to the Microsoft rally racer. The online factor makes it damn hard to resist also, flaws and all. I would say that for first time buyers, rent it first to see if you like the intense sim-style of racing. But for Colin fans, this is an absolute must-have. And for $29.99? You'd be silly to miss it.", "date": "Sep 30, 2004"}
