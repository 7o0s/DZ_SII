High Heat MLB has been kicking ass all over the baseball field for the last couple of years. From its original incarnation as Sammy Sosa High Heat way back in the day to last year's pinnacle of excellence entitled HH 2003, it's been one of the few critically successful franchises from Trip Hawkins' up and down brainchild known as 3DO. Though it's always been criticized for its last-year graphics and over-complicated menus, true baseball fans know how deep and realistic the gameplay engine really is and have come to love it like few others. Definitely one of the most respected ongoing series in the realm of digital sports, High Heat is a force always to be reckoned with.   This year appeared to be no different; as a few months ago in a special event held within the friendly confines of San Francisco's Pac Bell Park, 3DO unveiled the all-new High Heat for 2004. Boasting more customizable game sliders, brand new motion captures, redone stadiums, and plenty of additional features, the series looked ready to dominate the field once again -- perhaps this time, in a guise as close to perfection as you can get.   Strangely thereafter, High Heat pretty much fell off the radar. After the official unveiling at Pac Bell Park, little has been seen or heard from the game since. At first we thought the reason could be one of two possibilities: Either the designers were putting together something that would blow baseball fans out of the water for the next couple of years, or it was being delayed until later in the season to fine tune all the particulars. And though we still don't have definitive answers to those questions, we have a pretty good idea -- High Heat may finally be ready to concede to its age.   Now don't get us wrong, High Heat Major League Baseball 2004 still weighs in as one of the more solid sports games of early 2003. In possession of the same classic engine that's been powering the franchise for years, HH is still as easy to get into, diverse, and as statistically pleasing as it's always been. But with the collection of titles in this year's cluttered hardball division so incredibly infused with competitive spirit and quality, what used to be accepted as one of the best engines around may not be enough to cut it anymore.    Features  High Heat has always been generous with features in its PC incarnation, and the console version has finally caught up to it. Boasting eleven different modes of play, HH 2004 takes several steps beyond the product offered last year and genuinely tries rather hard to push feature diversity. All the classics are here for sure -- Home Run Derby, Exhibition, All-Star Games, Batting Practice, Player Editing devices, and other such goodies await the gamers who patiently explore its every area. A few departments in particular (Two-on-Two Showdown and the Career Mode) will probably be where most of the action is played.   Perfect for two-player matches Two-on-Two Showdown returns from last year and for the first time is presented as a PC option. A quick contest that allows gamers to choose two of their favorite players to face off against two choices from somebody else's camp (one pitcher and one batter), this is a super-fun extra that adds plenty of replay value and twists to an otherwise standard game of baseball. Can Kevin Brown and Shawn Green beat the combination of Barry Bonds and Jason Schmidt? Pair those two teams up against each other and find out! The most popular play mode in the entire IGN office, we expect siblings and friends all over the country to get into this one.   For deeper, more involved players, Career Mode is where you'll probably spend most of your time. Unrestricted by a set number of seasons to be played like the majority of other baseball games on the market, High Heat allows you to play as many years as you like. Player trades, free agents, rookie drafts, farm club development, and plenty of other aspects associated with running a baseball team have been included to provide as customizable an experience as possible. Though it would have been nice to see a coach option like World Series or MVP, at least the designers have finally thrown player salaries into the mix to make things a little more interesting. Though admittedly, it's a lot easier to run a franchise in High Heat than in Sega or EA's effort.   The best feature of all, however, has to be the twenty-plus slider types at your disposal. Allowing you to customize the game as much as you want, gamers can change everything from pitch speed and baserunning A.I. to error frequency and rate of foul balls. The flexibility here is enormous and when used by patient experimenters can help you create a baseball game designed specifically to your tastes.   As a strange omission, High Heat doesn't support online play as last year's version did. Acceptable to a point in console games, the lack of such a feature in a PC incarnation is damn near unforgivable; especially when it was a feature that's been offered for the last couple of years. Upgrading the features list with plenty of new extras while dumping an important extra like online play is nothing but bad news.    Speaking of bad news, High Heat Baseball is still the victim of poor menu design. More intuitive in last year's version, this new edition is too clunky for its own good. Using a series of complicated button presses and combinations to cycle through various categories and sub-options, finding exactly what you need to in HH2004 resides somewhere on the difficult side. When trading for players or performing rookie drafts in particular, the convoluted menu system can prove quite problematic and tacks on plenty of extra navigation units that should otherwise be non-existent. And what's with the lack of mouse support once the game launches? It appears that 2004 was the first time that the PC disc was ported from consoles, not the other way around.   Gameplay  Considered the World Heavyweight Champion of baseball by several of the videogame world's most rabid sports fans, High Heat has pretty much remained unchanged in the half decade of its existence. Timing based with no real divider between contact hitting and slugging, doing well in Double H is all about figuring out what kind of pitch your opponent is going to throw and then tapping the button at exactly the right moment while pushing in the matching zone. Pitching is setup in a very similar way with 27 different types of throws (including the rarely used fosh and slurve) with a strike and ball button to mix things up. Of course, you can change the direction of the ball by moving the directional pad in different directions, but it's somewhat difficult to tell where you're aiming since there's not an onscreen cursor or rumble-based hint system to tell you when you've left the strike zone. The system works when used with subtle taps and slight pitch adjustments, but for gamers who like to zigzag all over the map with bizarre combinations to mix up the hitter, it's not going to work out too well.   It's in this way that High Heat 2004 shows the age that we referred to earlier. While other baseball games have grown to include more interactive elements such as pitch meters, power swings, and the like, High Heat still relies on the same basic premise that it had when it first appeared all those years ago -- That is, as the apex of 32-bit baseball gaming. And to be honest, there isn't anything wrong with that; the system still works rather well. But after trying our hand at the more user-involved baseball engines of today and recognizing some truly inspired mechanical ideas, the archaic nature of High Heat's ever-aging batter and pitcher interface is becoming readily apparent.   Another bothersome tidbit is the game's definite lack of challenge. An easy victory almost every time out, beating the computer on the default difficulty setting is pretty much a foregone conclusion. Should you want to play a more realistic and sincere game of baseball, you'll need to switch the option menu all the way to the Hall of Fame selection. Once you're there, the game is far more entertaining and true to its roots, and with a few adjustments to the slider bar (baserunning and pitch speed up -- trust me on this), you'll have yourself a grand time on the diamond.   And that's what High Heat has always been about; it's faithfulness to the sport. So while the gameplay itself may seem a little on the simple side, digging into its roots will reveal a whole lot more than meets the eye. Passed balls, bad umpire calls, routine errors, muffed double plays, and idle batters-box skirmishes add a lot of flavor and life to an otherwise dinosaurian type presentation. And once you get the hang of things on the MVP and Hall of Famer levels, your team's stats will reflect their abilities. Jose Cruz will hit for power but remain inconsistent with his batting average. Shane Halter will start the season slowly and pick up steam towards the middle before losing ground again (and grabbing plenty of errors along the way). Barry Bonds will be walked at least once in almost every game he plays. And Brook Fordyce will prove his constant bad luck at hitting a high percentage of ground balls. Despite the two-generations old engine all you like, it's pretty sexy to know that the game can follow player patterns so well.   Luckily, High Heat refrains from falling into too many patterns. Players can surprise you now and then and perform differently than they're supposed to (both good and bad), and this is still the only baseball game in existence that has a realistic representation of strikeouts and walks while playing the game instead of only simming it. And speaking of simming it, the A.I. does a pretty good job of matching statistics with players, accepting and declining trades, and making auto adjustments to your lineup whenever there's an injury or roster change. That type of thing has got to account for something. Bugs that plagued console fans have been fixed as well, so that should make everyone happy too.     Graphics  One of High Heat's biggest selling points for this latest version were the touted motion captures that have been redone to finally move beyond the look the series has been sporting since its inception. Unfortunately those animations aren't as awesome as they were hyped up to be. Though they're terrific in spots (whenever outfielders toss the ball back to the diamond, passed balls, umpire calls, etc), there are still a lot of pops that occur despite the idea they'd be eliminated with this run through (if you're unfamiliar, a ~pop~ animation is when a character skips a series of movements and appears to suddenly change positions on the field without explanation; such as when a player catches the ball and then throws it back without ever changing the position of his feet or stance). It happens most often in High Heat 2004 whenever a character runs beneath a deep pop-fly; move yourself in the general vicinity and you'll miraculously catch it even if the ball is several paces in front of you.   You'll recognize some of the individualized player stances as well; but since the majority of the athletes were only emulated and not captured on a person-by-person basis, some of these guys end up looking like poor imitations of themselves. Barry Bonds and Alex Rodriguez in particular stand out as guys who appear somewhat similar to their real life counterparts but ultimately fail to do a convincing job of it. Player faces too are poorly represented, and when compared to other modern sports games just don't cut it.   To its credit, the stadiums look much better than they have in the past and have a true sense of size that the other games haven't quite mastered. Some of these arenas are huge, and High Heat recreates that fact almost perfectly; Larger fields like those found in New York or Tampa come across as absolutely gigantic, and watching your insignificant little player run across them to catch a ball is pretty impressive. If you dislike whatever angles you're given by default, however, there are plenty of camera choices to switch between until you find the one perfect for you. Batting and pitching perspectives offer the same amount of choices, including a couple of zingers that let you watch the action from skewed 3/4 perspective like EA Sports' MVP Baseball or a behind the pitcher cam very reminiscent of the old NES classic Bases Loaded.   Sound  Another new addition to the lineup this year is the additional vocal tracks recorded by the two-man announce team of Dave O'Brien and Chuck Valenches. Despite the fact that we don't have any particulars concerning how many lines of dialogue they recorded, there are certainly a few quips and comments that we don't remember from last year. The problem is that most of it sounds nearly identical to what we've heard before. From the ~Oh baby~ that O'Brien proclaims when someone goes deep to the pre-game descriptions before every contest. We appreciate the additional audio for sure, but the old seems to outweigh the new.   On a more positive note the crowds have taken a cue from World Series Baseball and begun heckling players on a more consistent basis. Goading the visiting team with vicious attacks and moderate barbs, the jokesters haven't personalized anything quite yet (or if they have, we haven't heard it), but it's a start. Other returning favorites like concession vendors, stadium announcers, and the organ players are just as much a part of the game as they are in real life. And while we can't find any documentation to support it, the stadium announcers we spoke of seem to have several more stylized cues and introductions.   Audiophiles may ultimately end up disappointed with the encoding technology however, as basic stereo surround is all that 3DO offers in terms of receiver support. In-game Dolby Digital, DTS, or similar ear-tantalizers have been left on the cutting room floor.Surprisingly High Heat's entry into the 2003 baseball market can best be described as a hardball analogy itself: As the market is full of new contenders and stars entering the prime of their careers, our old friend High Heat laces them up for just one more season to prove it still has what it takes. One of the last remaining players of a bygone era, it does its job well and does it well. Even if it can't keep up with younger and more flexible newcomers.A sentimental comparison aside, High Heat Baseball 2004 is definitely the type of game that old fans will be happy to return to. Basically unchanged with a few recognizable additions and accuracies to a sport that only the passionate truly enjoys, this title's illustrious career isn't quite over. But with so many new baseball games looking over its shoulder offering up a hell of a lot more in terms of interactivity and features, this could signal the beginning of the end. But don't worry faithful heaters; its last at bat hasn't come just yet.", "date": "Apr 1, 2003"}
