When people buy a racing game, they want to race, not walk the earth to do everything from upgrade the vehicles to change drivers  if it weren't for this design flaw, Mickey's Racing Adventure would have scored a lot higher in the ratings. So chalk this one up to listening to the public -- Mickey's Speedway USA is a revisit to the existing Rare GBC racing engine, but all this game focuses on is racing. And it proves my point perfectly  with a driving-only focus, this is one of the best racing games available on the 8-bit handheld. Features Six playable characters Twenty locations Grand Prix, Time Trial, and Driving Test modes Link cable support for two players Battery back-up Only for Game Boy Color  Anyone who's played the original Mickey's Racing Adventure will see that Mickey's Speedway USA is using a nearly identical version of the first title's game engine. If you're familiar with the classic RC Pro Am (another Rare original), then grasping the concept of this game  isometric view, four racers to a track, try not to bump the sides of the road...and try to come in first as many times as possible. The only thing the original Mickey's Racing Adventure has over Mickey's Speedway USA is that the original actually had boat racing to add a bit of variety. This game only has car racing  not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just that when you go back to the original, you have a tendency to notice the things that are left out the second time around.  Forget the storyline  it's just too darn silly and opens up more questions than it answers. It's basically a race across locations all over the United States  there are 21 total tracks in the game, one of which is completely hidden until you can earn the right to access it. It's the same for the other 20 tracks, but these open up after every circuit, and all you have to do here is come in at least third place or better in the competition. The tracks mirror the locations they're based in, so you'll find more hills in San Francisco, you'll cut across swamps in Louisiana, and zoom behind geysers in Yellowstone. Some tracks are trickier than others, but all of them are extremely challenging and beautiful to look at  the only thing I wish is that the designers offered an on-screen map in order to give a better lay of the land.  You have your choice of five different Disney characters, each with their own handling, top speed, and acceleration. It's going to take more than talented driving to beat the other three computer-controlled AI characters  that's where the power-ups come in. Grab a can hovering just above the track, and you'll be randomly awarded a power-up. A raincloud will cause the closest player to slightly lose control and speed of his car, a stick of dynamite will temporarily give your car a boost, a baseball can be used as a projectile, a remote-controlled car will automatically zoom to the closest opponent and send them spinning...and the shield will protect your vehicle from opponent's own offensive weaponry. The problem is, since this game is based on an older engine, it doesn't seem like the game was really made for these projectiles  if there are three cars on-screen, and you send off a baseball, the game slows down to a painful crawl  it's not something that can be overlooked, since it's so obvious. The Game Boy Color definitely has its hardware limitations, and it looks like this game's pushing the system as hard as it can go.    The standard single player championship is a snap to get through, as it'll take only about two hours from start to finish. The real challenge is in actually finishing first  you can complete the game just by finishing third or better, but it's a struggle to be the winner in every race. What's more, there's a time task for each of the tracks  earn the track's best lap time and you'll win a gold star. Win 20 gold stars, and it'll open up more secrets. In addition to all of this, the game has an easy to complete, but tough to win Driver's License challenge  you're given five tests to complete and you have to do them in a set amount of time. Earn five gold stars here and...well, you get the picture. And yep, the game does support the link cable so you can play one-on-one on all the earned tracks...with all the weapons you can use in the standard championship. Finally, if you've unlocked the Post Office in the original Mickey's Racing Adventure, you can transmit data from that game to this one...which will unlock another secret. For a racing game, there's a ton of variety...extending the experience well into the dozens of hours.  I really enjoyed the original Mickey's Racing Adventure except for those tedious walkabout portions that filled up most of the gameplay time. Mickey's Speedway USA gets rid of these lame portions all the while adding more to the great, existing racing engine. There are some technical issues that hinder the playability (the slowdown issue is just too obvious to overlook), but even with those sprinkled in the game, Mickey's Speedway USA is an excellent challenge and definitely one of the top racers on the Game Boy Color.", "date": "Apr 10, 2001"}
