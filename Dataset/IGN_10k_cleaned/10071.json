The iPod version of the game, however, expands on the core of the mobile game -- a Battleship clone of sorts -- in every way imaginable. This improved Naval Battle is an easy recommend for iPod gamers (an army that is apparently growing) as it's easy to pick up and very challenging to put down.   As mentioned, Naval Battle is a Battleship-style strategy game. Players start each battle by placing their fleet on a grid and then take turns launching attacks back and forth, trying to systematically sink each other's ships. Naval Battle tweaks that game mechanic with the addition of special weapons, bonus goals, and a story mode. None of these extras detract from the core at all -- in fact, the game healthily benefits.   After taking a certain number of turns or making a set number of attacks, you earn a special weapon volley. Depending on the make-up of your fleet, you have access to attacks such as torpedoes that cut a line down the screen, a battleship volley that covers a wide spread, and a magnetic mine that attaches to any nearby ships. These attacks offer plenty of extra strategy to the already compelling concepts of Battleship. Players will also appreciate bonus objectives, such as hitting special squares that reveal enemy intelligence or tagging an environmental feature, like a lighthouse or base.   Naval Battle also comes equipped with a number of medals, which act like achievements. At the end of each battle, you are awarded these medals for meeting objectives, like surviving a round without losing a single ship. Sure, these medals aren't attached to something as engaging as a Gamerscore, but instant rewards are always a good way to keep a gamer interested in playing just... one... more stage.   Gameloft's production team did a phenomenal job with Naval Battle. The video clips that you see at the beginning and end of battles or when you launch a special attack look fantastic. (And they are short, too.) The in-game graphics, from the ships to the character portraits that advance the story, are excellent. Wonderful color choices, too. And I cannot gloss over the music. Naval Battles has a great soundtrack.  If you like Battleship, there is no reason you will not enjoy Naval Battles. The game is incredibly playable thanks to easy controls, great production values, and a constant stream of rewards. The game costs only $4.99 and will last you hours, making it a good value, too. Highly recommended.", "date": "Feb 26, 2008"}
