Unfortunately, apart from....  Whoops. That was the review for NASCAR '99. Here's the new review for NASCAR 2000.    They say you shouldn't try to improve on perfection but there's almost an unwritten rule that you have to try to improve on mediocrity. Last year's NASCAR '99 was a decent racing game that seemed limited by the very fact that it was a NASCAR game. For NASCAR 2000 EA Sports and Stormfront Studios have rolled out a second stock car racing game that looks and plays remarkably similar to the first game. For die hard NASCAR fans, the simple tracks and tenacious driving against real life superstars might be a thrill, but even they might be disappointed by the lack of improvements made to N2000. Playstation owners seem to be getting as many new features as possible in their NASCAR 2000. Because of this, N64 owners may want to just hang onto their copies of NASCAR '99 for their stock car racing excitement because they certainly won't be missing much with this latest edition.  Features   33 active cars and drivers updated for 1999 including Dale Jarret, Jeff Gordon, Dale Earnhardt and Dale Earnhardt Jr. 18 official NASCAR tracks including Sears Point, Talledega and Martinsville. TV-Style commentary from Benny Parsons and Bob Jenkins. Adjustable gameplay for more of an arcade experience or more of a simulation racing game. Past racing legends like ~The King~ Richard Petty, Cale Yarborough, Davey Allison and Bobby Allison. Night racing at Richmond International Raceway and Charlotte and Bristol Motor Speedways. Dynamic lighting effects for both daytime and night races. New engine sounds. Multiple view choices with corresponding engine sounds. Split screen 2-player racing.   Gameplay Not much here other than holding down 'A' to accelerate and using the analog stick to steer. A good strategy to use is what we at IGN64 like to call the Yoda philosophy. ~Do or do not. There is no try.~ In this game, that translates to mash the gas or mash the brake. There is no coasting or cruising. Barreling into the sidewalls will cause big chunks of your car to come flying off along with occasional tire or two. So flooring it on the straightaways and braking just enough to avoid the walls as you come into a turn and then accelerating through the rest of the turn is the way to go.  The points of view are important to your driving style. Like most racing games you can drive much more aggressively using the first person perspective where all you see is the pavement in front of you. Toggling through the different view options is a little different this time around with a couple of extra third person views to choose from.  Like N99 you can choose arcade, simulation or customized A.I. for other drivers in the Championship and single race modes. In Championship mode he simulation setting is potentially the toughest because it makes the other drivers behave and react exactly as they would in real life, driving just as fast and aggressively as you would see on TV. Arcade style can get a little cheesy since all of the things that will help you catch up and pass the other cars are exaggerated like drafting effect or they're downplayed like speed sensitive steering.  The drafting effect can be so pronounced that you almost literally slingshot around cars ahead of you if you steer just the right way. In sim mode, you will have quite a challenge ahead of you since the only thing that will get you ahead of the competition is some steady driving and nerves of steel. This is the ultimate challenge, but it's about as fun as last year's.  The best new feature in N2000 is the drafting effect meter that shows up on the on screen display under your speed and tachometer. It fills up with more little blue dots the more you stay right in the draft of the guy in front of you. The only other notable new features in this game are the inclusion of rookie drivers Tony Stewart, Dale Earnhardt Junior and Adam Petty and the immediate availability of legends like ~The King~ Richard Petty. The new team sponsorships and different car designs are all accurate for the 1999 Winston Cup season, too. There's a handful of new commentary from announcer Benny Parsons and Bob Jenkins to go along with a few new quips from the pit crew.   Graphics Last year's game was criticized for a lack of detail for the various cars. The assortment of stickers and sponsors on your typical NASCAR vehicle almost makes it impossible to show every splash of color on every car. The fact is there's just not much to show off in a stock car racing game unless you want to see the actual drivers muttering curse words as they drive. There is a lot of draw-in that's more irritating on some tracks than on others.   One of the highly touted new features is the dusk-to-night transition that you'll see when you race the Charlotte Motor Speedway. As you race along, turning left every so often, your screen will pick up an orangish-yellow haze to it. After  you pause the game and tinker with your television's display controls, you'll figure out that it's part of the game. The haze will become more orange and yellow and darker every couple of laps or so. By this time you will have slapped your forehead and realized ~Oh, it's getting dark out on the old racing track.~ As you look forward to the next level transition you'll be jolted out of your seat as the scene on your TV screen goes from a dark, smoggy looking almost brown haze to an instant black sky with the track's lights suddenly turned on. It's about as subtle as a 12 car pileup.   One cool little thing that is back from last year's game is that you can see the different sleeves of the actual drivers when you use the cockpit view. The sleeves will usually have the same color scheme and writing as the stuff that's on the outside of the car.   Sound The engines all sound the same and you can barely hear the car shifting gears. One of the coolest things about World Driver Championship was how you could hear the different car engines depending on the car and what point of view you used for racing. The announcing is supposed to be redone over last year's version but it might as well be the same. Is there really a difference between hearing Parsons or Jenkins say ~Whoa! He lost a tire!~ or ~Hey, there goes a tire!~ The difference in commentary are pretty much along those lines. What would have been cool to have is some ranting and hollering from the drivers when they bump into each other or do something cool rather than having the announcers use the same old cliches.  The background music is much more edgy this time around. The good ol' boy twangy music from N99 has been replaced by some harder, more grinding guitar music that may be indicative of NASCAR's more mature attitude.  Since NASCAR 2000 would theoretically be at its best reflecting all of the little details of NASCAR racing, then as a videogame it could only be as fun and engaging as the sport it represents. The problem is, NASCAR '99 already did this and there's not enough new or improved about N2000 to warrant paying new money for the game. Considering that PSX version of N2000 is boasting new driver A.I., a create-a-driver feature and a Parappa style interactive pit stop system, it makes us wonder why at least some of those couldn't be thrown into the N64 version. A NASCAR game doesn't have much to work with anyway as far as gameplay, so adding a few standard arcade features like a more dynamic replay feature certainly wouldn't have hurt. It's not like N2000 for the N64 is a port of N99 for the PSX, since each console had its own version last year.Even if you dismiss the idea that N2000 may only N99 but with new stickers and box art, the game still has a lot going against it.  EA Sports knows how to do sports simulations but NASCAR as a sport may have trouble making the translation to videogames. Many N64 owners will see it as just another racing game with none of the cool or fun elements of a game like World Driver or Beetle Adventure Racing.We've been  here and done this game, and it's not good enough to do again.", "date": "Sep 18, 1999"}
