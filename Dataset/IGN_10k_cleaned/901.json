Tachyon, Allegiance, Freespace 2, X: Beyond the Frontier and the upcoming Freelancer have gone a long way to convincing us that the genre can still surprise and entertain us. Starlancer does both these things to an extent that I honestly hadn't expected it to. Sure I was excited about the game when we first heard about it -- very excited. Normally I try not to get so excited about a game before it comes out because it usually means I'll be disappointed with the final result. But Starlancer exceeded every expectation I had for it. While it's not a perfect game, it does so many things so well that it's foolish to concentrate on its faults.  The creation of a game involves the coordination of so many separate elements -- the graphics and sound have to be convincing, the story has to be engaging and the interface has to be smooth. There's nothing worse than being reminded by the interface that you're playing a game. But by far the one factor that's hardest to quantify is the flight model. Some sims lack any feeling of mass. Others are far too sluggish. Starlancer, like its Wing Commander ancestors, hits it just right. There's a definite arcade feeling to the game but it's a realistic kind of arcadishness. The ships feel and respond so convincingly and smoothly that you never feel like you're fighting against the controls.  And the interface and ship controls are really simple without being one-dimensional. You can fly the ship with a minimum of key commands, but if you really want to fine-tune your ship, there are ways to do it. Most of the time, you won't need to worry about energy or squad management -- after all, you just want to shoot stuff. But if you do want to micromanage things, Starlancer gives yTAou the chance. Many space sims make the mistake of putting too much responsibility on the shoulders of the player. While this approach can be very engaging, there are times when you'd just rather focus on the basics. And the way that the Starlancer controls function is very intuitive and obliging.  The game looks really good too. Everything from the explosions to the weapon effects to the ship models. The ship models are a little rougher than I like, but that's a totally personal thing and can't really be held against the designers. I just prefer the sleek, gleamy style of space ship design to the blocky, cobbled together look. The game also makes really good use of backgrounds. Although they're a trifle flat, the background textures go a long way to making you feel like you're battling in space. Especially cool are the planet backgrounds. Fighting above the surface of Saturn is a tremendous rush. I guess my only complaint against the overall graphic scheme of the game is that it's universally too dark. Sure space is supposed to be dark but this is a game and it would've gone a long way towards making things more enjoyable if I could've seen a little better. But since there's a handy gamma correction feature in the game, I can't really complain.  The 3D-walkabout shipboard interface is fantastic. The various stations on board the ship are actually worth visiting not only because they give you detailed hinkfo on all sorts of subjects, but also because they really enhance the sense of place for you. When you walk into the briefing room, you turn and see the individual pilots sitting around and talking among themselves. When you get to the higher ranks, people in the hall will actually stop and salute you. Since all the sequences are pre-rendered, you can't really move around wherever you want, but the effect is still wonderful.  But if you want to be well informed, you'll need to visit the ITAC (Intelligence and TActical Computer) station. Here you can reread all of your mission debriefings (why isn't there a similar feature for the briefings?) and see where you did well and where you really screwed up. There's also a kill board so you can track your progress. And as well as I did overall in the game, I was happy to see that there were still a few names above mine by the time I had finished the game. The ITAC files on Coalition and Alliance ships are actually really worth studying as it will give you an edge when deciding where, how and whom to engage in combat. Of less use are the squadron biographies but it's included as a story element.  The mission briefing room is where your squadron leader will give you the all the information on your upcoming mission. For the most part, these are very well done and help keep you oriented during flight. But most of your direction comes from in-flight cues given to you by other members of the Alliance. It's pretty hard to get lost in terms of your next objective. Still, the mission briefings are supported by some nice animation and are worth watching if only to see all the pilots running to their ships at the end.  The missions themselves are fantastic. You've almost always got some sort of objective other than 'kill everything.~ This forces you to play a little more intelligently as you can't simply go around wasting missiles on every opponent you see. And since many of the missions have timed events (such as resupply ships arriving, enemy ships warping in or out, etc) you'll have to keep your eye on the clock as well. I was really impressed not only with the missions themselves, but how well they're tied together. There's a really great story that ties it all together and your actions will have an effect on the way the story unfolds. There are crushing sacrifices, malicious betrayals and daring escapes and most of these events occur within the missions themselves. In all, the missions in this game are remarkably well designed.  I found the actual ships to be very well designed as well. There is a real practical difference between the ships in terms of performance and construction. The trade off seems to be between speed and durability but there are some finer points that distinguish one ship from another. It may seem strange that my favorite ship for all but the last four missions, was a ship that I had started the game with, the Naginata. But this is probably just a factor of the way that I fly as several other members of the staff have expressed a preference for other ships. Not only that, they actually laughed at my choice of the Naginata. We'll see who's laughing tonight when I kick their asses.  One of the only holes in the game would have to be the near complete lack of collision modeling. Unless you're really trying hard, it's almost impossible to have a fatal crash in this game. It's ridiculous to smash head-on into an enemy fighter only to bounce back a bit and keep going. I don't know if this is some sort of advanced force field technology, but I'd be willing to pay to get it installed on my car. You can manage to kill yourself by crashing but only if you keep at it for a while -- or if you have no shields or hull left in the quarter that absorbs the impact. But really this is only a minor (although galling) flaw that I can live with.  If there's anything else wrong with the game its lack of multiplayer slots. Only being able to play with four separate players really limits the multiplayer options here. I know the team was worried that dogfights in space might degenerate into big turning battles but that seems to be exactly the result here. Since you can have only four players in the game at a time, you've got nothing better to do than keep trying to get behind the few enemies you've got.  But the multiplayer side of Starlancer deserves a large amount of praise as well. After playing games all day and sitting so close to one another, the last thing the PC boys want to do is sit around together late into the night playing more games. That sort of behavior is saved for the really special games -- games like Rogue Spear or Re-Volt or Tribes. But StarLancer has kept us going for quite some time now, either in quick deathmatches in the multiplayer cool multiplayer spaces or co-op mission play.  In the end, StarLancer is a remarkable game with only a few minor problems. It may be a little too much like an arcade game for some tastes, but the game is quite well balanced. It offers amazing visuals, intense gameplay and a compelling story. Most games only make it with one or two of these advantages but with StarLancer you get all three.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Apr 29, 2000"}
