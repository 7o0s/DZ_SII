Looks like wireless gaming to now legit, because THQ has released a to-go version of the famous Russian puzzler. Tetris helped sell millions of the original, clunky Game Boy worldwide--will it have the same effect on game-enabled cellphones?  Features: Classic puzzle game  The answer: probably not.  Tetris has reached a certain saturation point.  It's been released for every single console and computer.  Hell, it's probably even available on those superfridges that order milk for you when you run out.  But Tetris still is an incredibly entertaining, addictive puzzler, and THQ's wireless version is certainly a decent port of the venerable game.  You likely know the drill.  Blocks of varying shapes fall from the sky, and you must assemble them in a well.  Fill a line, clear a line.  Of course, mega-points for clearing four lines at a time--a tetris--which is usually only achieved by sliding in that long, skinny piece at the last moment.  This is straight-forward Tetris, which is both nice and disappointing at the same time.  Pleasant, because often, variations on the Tetris theme have resulted in some awful games, such as some of the modes in THQ's own Tetris Worlds for the next-gen consoles.  However, there are the occasional fun takes on Tetris, such as Nintendo's Tetris Attack or Capcom's Magical Tetris, are the option to play something like one of these would have certainly been appreciated.  But at least this Tetris gets the vanilla game right.  Tetris is actually a perfect game for a cellphone, since control requires only a few, simple commands.  Touchpads and tiny joysticks handle these functions with ease.  And the visuals are inherently limited--these are just blocks, after all--so cellphones can successfully handle these, too.  THQ's wireless Tetris is colorful, every block is a different hue--and they're the same hues you've been accustomed to for all these years, so no goofy confusion there.I still smile when I imagine Howard Lincoln running through an airport in his pj's, rushing to nail the exclusive rights for Tetris. And, at the time, such an effort was worth it--as Tetris was a system-seller for Nintendo's Game Boy. But Tetris is everywhere now, chances are you've played, and you're either done with it--or you have enough versions of it already. THQ's wireless Tetris is a competent rendition, though, so if you're in need of a Tetris fix, this is worth the download.", "date": "Mar 31, 2003"}
