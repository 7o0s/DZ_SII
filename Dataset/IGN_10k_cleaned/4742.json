Although these are all shooters, the feeding frenzy bled over into other genres, particularly reinvigorating WWII-themed RTS development in Europe. Burning Horizon, the stand-alone expansion pack to Blitzkrieg, is a solid and generally satisfying result, although it is not without some issues.  Burning Horizon features the early European Theater from the German perspective, with 18 single-player missions starring Rommel's Armored 7th taking you through such highlights as the Maginot Line, D-Day, El Alamein, and Ardennes. Each mission starts with a detailed briefing offering both historical background and strategic advice, and here you can also dig through the game's towering database of units. You'll not only get to look at and compare stats like front armor, rear armor, and penetration, but many if not most of the units come with authoritative descriptions describing what role it played, how and why it improved on an older model or was replaced by a later one, and how it compared to the opposition's version. The Germans generally had artillery with high accuracy but relatively low damage, and the Americans had some beefier tanks, for example. However, there are some oddities like map objects being included in the list. For example, you see ~Destroyed Tank~ in the list, with no description or stats. Still, it's a very impressive piece of work, overall.  Although you can't cherry-pick a list of vehicles, infantry, and artillery for a mission (probably to maintain some historical continuity) you can earn upgrades if you perform well--e.g., keeping your men alive, making efficient and effective use of air support, and getting the objectives done in a timely manner. After one mission, an advanced Panzer became available and I was able to replace all combat vehicles with it (as most units carry over from mission to mission). You aren't able to build structures and pump out units Command & Conquer-style, so it's important to take care of your men. You can reinforcements, typically in the form of paratroopers, but they have to drop in a safe location and sometimes aren't available for that mission.    I should also add that, for those new to the Blitzkrieg games, there is an exhaustive and well-crafted multi-stage tutorial. Actually, it covers not only how to play Blitzkrieg, but how to coordinate and mobilize in a military encounter. The subtleties of effective infantry tactics are laid out--fortify in a building or go prone to limit casualties, stay away from open ground, use snipers to eliminate gun emplacements, and make sure someone has heavy equipment when a tank comes rolling in. With Burning Horizon's huge amount and type of units--armored trucks, tanks, AA guns, Howitzers, supply trucks, engineers, dogfighters, recon and bomber planes--there's a lot of strategy to cover, but thankfully you're helped out by not only the tutorials but by a boatload of keyboard shortcuts. In theory, the sheer number of them would be intimidating, but every time you hover your mouse over a command on the unintrusive interface, you get a quick description and reminder of what the shortcut is, so it sinks in gradually. Press S to face a gun in a certain direction, X to choose suppressive fire, right-click to choose the location--not so tough.  In general, unit control is quite fluid. Double-click on any unit to select all units of that type shift-click to select individual units, hit CTRL+1, CTRL+2, et cetera, to form groups which will be hot-keyed thereafter to the number key. Unfortunately, the hot-key tags are microscopic, even at 1024x768, and the infantry aren't easy to distinguish, either, so you really have to squint to see who belongs where, once you've manually assigned them. With a large force, it can take some time to organize everything the way you like it, but BH is forgiving enough to allow you to queue commands while the game is paused. You can also create waypoints and a chain of commands for a single group using the Shift key. If any of that sounds confusing, the tutorial should sort it out, and there's the hefty 80+ page manual that should fill any remaining holes, with some 20 pages alone dedicated to ~Managing Troops and Tactics.~      With pauseable combat and real-time game speed adjustment using the + and - keys on the number pad, BH single-player is wonderfully flexible towards a wide range of play styles, whether you come from the turn-based or C&C school, and allows a punishment-free introduction for newbies. You can also save the game at any time, as many times as you want, although the default name of the file will be the same as the last file, prompting you manually type in a new name to prevent over-writing the old one. A small thing, perhaps, but noticeable if you're slotting a lot of saves. A periodic or objective-based autosave would also have been a nice addition, because it's easy to forget in the heat of battle.  Unfortunately, you will need to pause and re-organize a little too often, particularly in the urban environments, because there isn't a clear indication of sufficient space for entrenchment and positioning, nor do units move out of the way quickly enough for smooth mobilization. If you place your AA gun too close to a building or another unit, you won't be able to entrench it or point it in the right direction. Then you need to bring the hauler back and nudge around a few feet this way or that until you get it just right. If infantry did a better job of anticipating an oncoming vehicle and paving the way for it, that would go a long way towards greasing the strategic wheels. Thankfully, infantry is otherwise quite responsive and will automatically go prone as a group when attacked and group into marching formation smoothly for faster movement. However, heavy gunner infantry can't be transported in a truck, which can drag combat down when you're ordered to move them to a distant objective.  Speaking of objectives, you'll encounter a few that feel a little arbitrary, although they do help you strategically in the long run. In one early mission, I had to take six heavy gunners across a small bridge on the north side of the map, which turned out to be a good distance from the eventual action. But the mission would not advance until I trudged them over there, even though I would eventually advance the rest of my units across a more immediate bridge for the final offensive.    In the long run, Blitkrieg offers tactical and strategic depth that should satisfy the wargamer crowd, while using gameplay mechanics like pauseable combat to entice the rest. However. the opposing forces didn't always take as much offensive initiative as I would have liked, making the game too easy at times. There were sections where I could take pot shots at the units on the fringe, draw out core units to hit with longe-range artillery, then hit them hard with aerial bombardment, then rush in with a line of armor, but BH did an otherwise good job of preventing a formulaic approach, thanks to objective variety like assassination, evacuation, and covert ops. However, the sheer number of units you'll have under control at certain times will make for awkward coordination, especially if one of them gets too close to an enemy unit and fires upon him before you're ready to move forward. What typically happens at that point is that the enemy AI sends some units on a quick scouting loop then drops some aerial bombardment on you, which can be devastating if you're not properly positioned with AA guns and fortification.  Speaking of AA guns, heavy artillery deployment can take a considerably long time, with the gun taking seemingly forever to detach from the hauler and plant itself. Then you need to entrench it and point it in the right direction, a theoretically simple matter that becomes frustrating when dealing with an incoming force and/or discovering that your artillery doesn't have sufficient room to face and dig in.Despite these problems, Burning Horizon offers some extensive and diverting entertainment--as far as the horrors of war can be truly entertaining--which should keep you in thrall until Blitzkrieg 2, which we're told will be in full 3D this time. What keeps it from a more confident recommendation is the large number of units you'll be dealing with and the possibly intimidating strategic and tactical considerations that fall outside of what the mainstream run-n'-gun RTS gamer is generally used to.", "date": "Jun 3, 2004"}
