You never saw a pudgy Superman in the comics, or an overweight Batman on TV. But the introduction to the world of video gaming's odd, warped sense of reality made it possible for anyone, of any body type, to save the day  like a slightly rotund plumber in a red cap, or a big, spherical yellow man with a compulsion to consume glowing dots. So it wasn't all that odd when Adventure Island, for the NES, starred a fairly fat fellow with an insatiable appetite for fruit. He's a hungry, hungry Higgins.   Master Higgins, to be proper. A video game hero who comes complete with trademark white hat, grass skirt, and no shirt. He proudly presents his ever-burgeoning belly to his many island foes, as he hops and bops his way through side-scrolling levels to save his kidnapped girlfriend. Adventure Island is one of Hudson's classic games, a basic run-and-jump platforming quest with a tropical setting, and plenty of Vitamin C.   Displayed at the top of the screen in Adventure Island is the fruit gauge, a meter that both serves as an indicator of Higgin's health and a countdown clock spurring you on to finish each level.  The bars it contains disappear at a rate of one every few seconds, and if the gauge completely drains then Higgins will lose a life. To avoid this fate, you'll need to feed  grabbing floating bunches of bananas, or apples, or other rich-in-citrus produce will replenish the meter bit by bit.     But, unfortunately, that gauge is one of the few unique and innovative things that Adventure Island introduced. It's all very basic other than that, with Higgins hustling constantly to the right side of the screen, jumping over obstacles. You can equip him with a handful of different items, like skateboards, flying stone axes and flaming bolas, which gives you a little something more to do besides hopping platforms  but there's never much more depth to the game than what you'll find in the very first level.   The end-area boss battles are even repetitive, as each world's big, main foe is simply the same as the last, with a different head sprite pasted on top of the same old body. That's a graphical shortcoming that speaks for the rest of the game, overall, as there isn't much impressive visual flare anywhere on this Island.   Adventure Island isn't without its own old-school charm, of course, and prior players of the title from the '80s 8-bit era will be encouraged to know that the game's inherent goofiness and wacky appeal is still in place  and that's an important factor, as it was an appeal that launched this one game into an entire franchise series for Hudson back in those days. Adventure Islands II through IV also came to the NES, and expanded greatly upon the foundation laid down here  and the series continued further even beyond that, to a couple of titles on the SNES and TurboGrafx as well.The Turbo installment, New Adventure Island, is also currently available on the Virtual Console for just 100 Points more than this download would run you. And its upgrades in visuals and sound probably justify the extra buck for curious players, because gameplay-wise the two titles are essentially the same. We'd recommend going that route rather than investing in this game, but don't let that turn you off from the later NES and SNES Island Adventures  they mixed up the fruit-munching formula quite a bit, and will each be worth a look when they eventually arrive in the Wii Shop.", "date": "Sep 18, 2007"}
