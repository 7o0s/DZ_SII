But it looks like 1999 is the year the Beavis and Butt-head train starts to slow down a little bit, at least as far as computer games are concerned. First we get Beavis and Butt-head in Bunghole in One, a miniature golf game that's got all your favorite characters but not enough gameplay to keep things interesting for very long. I was holding out more hope for Beavis and Butt-head Do U., but as a long-time gamer and Beavis and Butt-head fan I've got to admit that it falls short of my expectations in both the humor and gameplay departments.  Part of the letdown might be because the setup seems so promising. The game starts as hippie teacher Mr. Van Driessen takes the class on a field trip to the local college, and to make sure the two metalheads don't run completely rampant he's promised them they can attend a party at the end of the day  provided they collect eight signatures from various people working at the school. Well, just the word ~party~ is enough to get the two delinquents' heads spinning with visions of booze and broads  and that's enough to make them eager to do what they've been told for one of the few times in their lives.  To get all those John Hancocks, though, the boys are going to have to perform a few tasks: play a cello in the music department, perform a high jump the track, milk a cow and collect eggs in the agriculture building, sketch a vase in the art department, deliver a package to a dorm room, spin tunes and take phone calls at the radio station, and so on. Those jobs all sound easy enough  but you're forgetting who's trying to do them. Invariably the two screw things up the first time around, and it's up to you to figure out how to make things right.  One area where Beavis and Butt-head definitely does not suck is the interface. Sick of adventure games where you spend more time walking around and waiting for screens to load than you do solving puzzles or talking to characters? Then you'll love Beavis and Butt-head's handy map of the college: just haul up the map and click on where you want to go, and you're there faster than you can say ~Breaking the law! Breaking the law!~ The full-screen inventory is a nice blast from the past, too: instead of scrolling an inventory bar and seeing only a handful of the items you've collected, a single click on a brown paper bag reveals every object Beavis and Butt-head have found or stolen. It's the perfect system for use with puzzles that require you to combine two items to create a new one  so it's a bummer that there are only one or two puzzles like that in the game.  To its credit, Beavis and Butt-head Do U. never leaves you wondering what the hell you're supposed to do next; the problem is that the solution to nearly every puzzle is so obvious even these two dimwits stand a good chance of figuring them out. Don't take that to mean you're a dummy if you get stuck trying to figure out how Beavis can fool the music teacher into thinking he's playing the cello or how to make it look like Van Driessen's a blind guitarist; all it means is that you probably haven't played very many adventure games. But even beginners will figure out solutions to these and the other problems once they get used to the conventions of the game  and when that happens you can expect things to draw to a close pretty damn fast, because there just aren't many things to do or places to go.  The real disappointment, though, isn't how short the game is or how simplistic the puzzles are: it's the uninspired dialogue. You'd have to be as dumb as Beavis and Butt-head to get a laugh out of their usual lines like ~Shut up, dillhole!~ or ~Come to Butt-head,~ and the exchanges that go beyond that just aren't up to the standards I'm used to from the show and the movie. I'll put it this way: I've laughed out loud a lot more during a single good episode than I grinned playing this game.  For beginning gamers who love the series, Beavis and Butt-head is probably a decent buy at $29.99, provided they're not expecting the game to rival the show in the humor department. Intermediate and advanced players, though, are probably better off using the time they'd have spent with this game taping episodes they've missed over the years, and using the money they would have spent go to the new Beavis and Butt-head movie when it comes out this August.  -- Chris Buckman", "date": "Mar 16, 1999"}
