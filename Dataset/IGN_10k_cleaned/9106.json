After all, it doesn't feature the much-touted Be A Pro Mode and there's no skill moves to pull off with the right analogue stick - because, obviously, the console doesn't actually have one. Instead, FIFA 08 kicks off on Wii complete with arm-waggling manoeuvres, quirky mini-games and a Mii-like Ronaldinho with amusingly large teeth. But, you know what? Rather than a cynical attempt to appeal to the Wii-mote waving masses, it's actually a fresh, fun experience that's a decent new take on the long-running series.   While it features the same official teams and tournaments as FIFA 08's other editions, it's much closer to the PS2 game than the slower-moving 360 version. Here, the action moves thick and fast, the ball speeding quickly from end-to-end as teams break forward on the attack. What's more, passing seems far more fluid than the next-gen game; you're nearly always able to locate a player who's found a bit of space and it's easy to perform a succession of perfect passes before slamming the ball into the back of the net. In fact, although FIFA 08 isn't as hectic as Mario Strikers it's definitely got a similar sense of speed thanks to the quick arcade-style gameplay.   Although Wii-mote waggling is tiring, it's bizarrely entertaining.  Indeed, even controls share common ground with Nintendo's footie game, the Nunchuk used to move players around and the A or B buttons pass the ball around or defend. However, things get a little weirder when it comes to shooting, clearing the ball, corners, goal kicks and throw-ins. That's because you use the motion-sensing capabilities of Wii-mote to pull these off. For example, a throw-in involves quickly pushing both the Nunchuk and remote forward, while shooting for the goal needs a sharp shove downward or upward.   While there's no shaking the sense it's all a little gimmicky, it's still bizarrely enjoyable and, when you've got two players whipping their arms around, it's undoubtedly involving. That said, extended Wii remote waving results in an aching arm, particularly after a long session. Furthermore there are times when it feels imprecise because the same movement is used to pull off so many moves. For example, during a corner kick you could be moving the controller hoping to boot the ball, but when the kick comes in you jump to head it instead - because the different actions use identical movements. At the very worst the opposition will intercept the ball and your player will slide tackle all over the place, which gives the other team valuable seconds to go on the offensive. But thankfully moments like this happen rarely and such niggles, while frustrating at times, don't really affect the fun that can be had with the game.   Table Football is one of the Wii's greatest (and tiring) mini-games yet.  Deeper tactical and more complicated play is sometimes tricky, but this is largely due to the lack of buttons on the Wii-mote, which means the developers have had to get creative when cramming in multiple manoeuvres. Advanced passing techniques, tricks and defending involve quite complicated button combinations - for example, pulling off a one-two pass lob requires you to hold down C while pressing A, then pressing A+B. While that might not sound too hard in theory, when you're hammering down the field in the final minutes of a match, desperate to score the winning goal, such combos can be confusing.     In an attempt to compensate, EA has introduced its new Family Play control method - meant for casual Wii players not used to, well, buttons. This method of control only requires the Wii Remote and you need only worry about passing, shooting and tackling while the AI handles the movement of all your players. For some reason, the AI also takes it upon itself to pass the ball of its own accord on occassion which defeats the whole object of the control method, really. However, aside from the odd stray pass here and there, it's a great introduction to the FIFA series for someone who's never played before or likes to keep things super simple.   An on-screen guide explains how to perform set pieces, like free kicks.  To accompany this kid-friendly Family Play, EA has also introduced the Footii Party mode. This is a collection of three football-themed mini-games: Juggling, Boot It and Table Football. Juggling is a rhythm action keepy-uppy game which sees you moving the Wii Remote in time to the beat. It's actually surprisingly enjoyable - thanks in part your newly-bodied Mii who pulls off classier moves than Ronaldinho. Boot It, meanwhile, is the weakest of the three games and simply involves swinging the remote about, trying to kick balls at targets. It's imprecise and rather random. Finally, Table Football is an excellent Wii-ised version of the popular pub game that involves twisting the controller round to move the tiny plastic footballers. It's great fun and with four players all shooting for goal at once, it becomes a real hoot. Overall, Footii Party is a nice addition to the FIFA 08 package and is a perfect fit for Wii - we hope EA Sports expands this feature in future editions.   EA should have released this rhythm action game instead of Boogie.  Also commendable is the inclusion of online mode in FIFA 08, although it does require you to register for EA Sports' own servers. Once online, you can participate in the EA Sports Interactive League, which sees you choosing your favourite club and then playing through real-life fixtures. Your results are then combined with those of supporters of the same team to produce an overall league of teams based on players' match results. It's another bit of added value and offers an extra thrill when you're playing through tense matches. There's also an option to play against other players online and, for once, this doesn't involve Friend Codes because you're playing on EA's servers, which is great for those that hate the system.FIFA 08 on Wii is great fun then. It's not the super-realistic football experience the next-gen versions provides but that's not the point of FIFA on Wii. Instead it's much more about quick-paced action and controls that are easy to pick up, and in that respect it succeeds admirably. Yes, there may be some issues with the waggle and the more complex ball techniques but it won't really affect the fun you can have with the game. What's more, the inclusion of the Footii Party mini-games are a nice way to make the title more Wii-friendly and were sure youll be cracking out the Table Football party game when youve got pals round, even if they dont like football.", "date": "Sep 26, 2007"}
