Determined not to let that happen again, 989 Sports has put together what might be its finest game in the series, NBA ShootOut 2000, to wage war with EA Sports' latest, NBA Live 2000.   Gameplay Much like the competing NBA basketball videogames, NBA ShootOut 2000 features the full NBA team and player licenses and is jam-packed with all of the features that will make any die-hard fan ecstatic. ShootOut 2000 features Simulation and Arcade modes, both with Rookie, Veteran, All-Star, and Hall of Fame difficulty settings.   The game also can be tweaked by changing the length of the periods, and turning on or off features like Fatigue, Touch Shooting, and Close Scores. The roster management in the game is easily on par with any other basketball game on the PlayStation. Season stats are kept for players, teams, and league leaders. And, the stats that are tracked include every single major statistical category in basketball, plus a few other less-significant categories.   The roster management is also top-notch. Players can edit starters, trade players, sign free agents and draft players from the current crop of NBA talent. Using and saving the edited rosters are easily done and all of the game's menus are well laid out and very easy to navigate.   Seasons can be played with either the original 98-99 NBA rosters, or the edited ones. And the number of the games in the season can be 28, 56, or the full 82 games. The length of the playoff games can also be adjusted from either a 5-7-7-7 or single elimination format. Additionally, it can be setup so that the CPU takes part in player trades and the trade deadline can be turned on or off.   The in-game options are tremendously deep, as well. Players can alter the default defensive matchups in various ways. Not only can the player choose which team member will cover each opposing player, but the tightness of the coverage can be set to three different settings (normal, tight, loose). Additionally, if the other team has a star player that must be stopped, it can be setup so that that player is automatically double-teamed whenever he gets control of the ball.   The offensive and defensive game plans can also be changed during the game. On both offense and defense, the player can setup four different plays that can be called during the game. The player can choose to run plays from seven different sets (high post, low post, one guard, two guard, one four, box, and triangle).    There are seven different plays that can be run from those sets: Pick n Roll, Clear Middle, Isolation, Handoff, Backdoor, Lob, and 3pt Play. Defensively, the player can choose among four strategies: Full Court Press, Half Court Press, 3/4 Court Press and Half Court Trap. From those four options, a default strategy can also be set. The one major complaint about the playcalling is that plays are called by pressing the SELECT button plus one of the four face buttons. This can't be done fluidly, so it slows down the pace of the game much more than it should.   Of course, all the options and features in the world aren't enough to make a great basketball videogame. In the end, the thing that means the most is the tangible gameplay. In this department, ShootOut 2000 is a very mixed bag.   One of the things that the game does right (and does better than any other basketball videogame) is the shooting mechanics. Introduced in previous versions of its various basketball videogame titles, 989's exclusive Touch Shooting Meter is one of the coolest ways to handle shot accuracy in a basketball game.   For those not familiar with how it works, when a player presses the SQUARE button to shoot the ball, a shot meter will come up next to the player. This meter has four colored areas: Green, Yellow, Red, and Clear. If the button is released when the marker is in the green area, the accuracy of the shot is 100%. If it's released in the Yellow area, the accuracy of the shot is based on the NBA player's shooting attribute in the corresponding shooting location (inside/outside/3pt). And releasing the button when the marker is in the red area will decrease the accuracy of the shot to 50% of whatever the rating is in the Yellow area. Having the marker end up in the clear area will almost guarantee a missed shot.   The Touch Shooting Meter is by far this game's best feature because it gives the player more control over the accuracy of the shot than simply releasing the button at the height of the character's jump, which is how it works in most other games. What's more, it's not easy to hit the green area, especially on the higher difficulty settings. As a result, the ~100%~ spot won't easily become something that can be easily accomplished, which would make the game somewhat cheap.   The free-throw system is your typical T-type setup, with the only difference from other games being that there's a top view of the hoop in the meter. While this isn't anything revolutionary, the T-system is the best way to accurately perform free throws in a basketball game. And, as the saying goes, if it's not broke, don't fix it.   One of the problems with most other basketball videogames is that there's not a realistic variety of missed and made shots. In many games, most made shots are just swishes or cleans banks off the backboard, and most missed shots simply just bounce off the rim. In ShootOut 2000, the ball physics seem to be handled in a realistic manner.   There are a wide variety of made shots, as the ball can bounce off the rim in various fashions and still end up going in, and the ball doesn't always go through the net in the exact same way and direction. There's also a good variety in the way the ball bounces off the rim and backboards on missed shots. The only negative is that the rim seems ultra bouncy and soft. There are a very small number of long rebounds in the game -- this is an important aspect of basketball that seems to be ignored in all basketball videogames.   Now that the game's positive features have been discussed, let's move on to what 989 did wrong. One of the most significant control issues with the game is that the player isn't given control over the backing-down on opposing players. If the speed burst button isn't being used, the controlled player will automatically lean backward into the defender. The animations for this are nice, and the size of the player does seem to affect the effectiveness of the post-up, but this shouldn't be something that is automatically done. Backing down a player should be completely under the control of the game player.   While you can negate the problem with automatically backing up by using the speed burst to try and get by the defender, there's also a big problem with this. If the controlled player isn't cleanly around the defender, he'll bump into and awkwardly bounce backwards. There's no real collision detection and momentum represented here.   Another huge negative is that there's way too many steals, blocked shots, outrageous slam dunks, and reach in fouls. The end game numbers for the steal and blocked shot categories are about four to six times what one would see in a real NBA game (even with the shorter periods).    Furthermore, while the increase in difficulty of the Touch Shooting Meter is done well, but the computer AI isn't. On the highest difficulty setting the computer will rarely miss a shot. The only way to stop them from scoring is to block shots or steal the ball before they shoot it. This provides for a very difficult challenge and a competitive game, but this isn't the best way to make the game more difficult. The end result is an unrealistic basketball experience.   Another annoyance is that the ball appears to be flat. When it is knocked loose on steals or hits the court after a blocked or missed shot, it sort of just lands on the court and rolls. The game ends up being full of players racing for loose balls just sitting or rolling on the ground. Real basketballs have a little bounce in them.    Graphics The previous version of ShootOut, NBA ShootOut '98, was considered the most graphically impressive basketball of its time. In fact, some players still consider it to be the best as many of the current crop of basketball games don't really contain graphics that are that much superior to it.   ShootOut 2000 basically follows that same trend. On the whole, it is an improvement of ShootOut '98, but it's not a huge improvement over it. There are a lot of nice player animations and the animations of the rim and backboards are superior to any other basketball videogame on the market. This is one of the few games that seems to have accurate ball physics and it shines through with the movement of the basketball rim and backboard on shots and dunks.   The problem with the animation is that they generally don't flow well together. The dunks, behind the back passes, and signature moves all animate well, but the transition from different moves is almost non-existent. For example, the transition from dribbling towards the left with your left hand to dribbling towards the right with your right hand just isn't there. There are basically no frames of animation that represent the crossover dribble that takes place. This lack of animations is also apparent with many other transitions in the game.     Sound The sound effects do an excellent job of emulating the real sounds of a NBA basketball game. Everything from the occasional squeaks of the shoes, to the faint swish sound of the ball going through the net, to the assorted crowd cheers are all well-represented in the game.   A single announcer handles the game's play-by-play. There's nothing really special about it, but it by no means detracts from the game at all. There's also voice in the form of a stadium announcer that occasionally chimes in for player introductions and other minor stuff. Again, nothing out of the ordinary, but it does help create a true-to-life atmosphere to the game.   Sporadically, some rock and pop tunes will kick in during the games. The tunes range in quality and include some classic and other less than classic songs. The one song that stood out the most was the ageless classic from Dino with the chorus of ~That's the way, uh huh, uh huh, I like it.~ You just can't go wrong with that.  So, the question on everyone's minds is undoubtedly, ~Which is better, Live 2000 or ShootOut 2000?~ There isn't a really easy answer to this. Both games have numerous things about them that are improvements over the other. ShootOut's frame rate and overall speed are better than Live. Whereas, Live has much smoother player animations. The all-important gameplay is also fairly even on the hole. The touch-shooting meter is one of the best features in any basketball videogame, but, much like Live, ShootOut 2000 has numerous issues with realism. Much like Presidential elections are for most people, choosing which was the better game ended up being a choice of the lesser of two evils. Ultimately, I came away feeling that there were just a few more significant problems in ShootOut 2000 than Live 2000. Although, both games are pretty much in the same ~slightly above average~ quality and both are among the best basketball videogames on the PlayStation. Live is just a little better.", "date": "Dec 23, 1999"}
