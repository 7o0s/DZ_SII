{"name": "Blast Factor", "name_review": "Blast Factor UK Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/20/blast-factor-uk-review", "text": "When Sony announced the PS3's Folding@Home project last week, aiming to fight incurable diseases by linking together machines to form an all-powerful super computer, we were pretty impressed. However, while it's a noble idea, truth be told we prefer stuff that's a bit more hands-on. So, you can imagine our delight at the prospect of playing Blast Factor, an old-skool shooter available direct from the PlayStation Store that sees you ridding cells of deadly viruses. Who needs Folding@Home when you've got a three-way laser?   There's nothing big or clever about the way Blast Factor plays and it follows the most traditional of game concepts - a well-armed but lone spaceship going up against hordes of enemies, as well as confronting all-powerful boss guys. You can almost smell the smoking bullet shells from classic shooters like Robotron or even Asteroids when playing. However, any comparison cries are likely to be bellowed loudest by Xbox 360 and PC owners, who've been playing Mutant Storm Reloaded for almost two years. It's no surprise either, because Blast Factor and Mutant Storm are virtually identical.   You must tilt the SIXAXIS to expose the weak spots of some enemies.  Take the control method for example. In both, you move around with the left analogue while directing your shots with the right stick. Both games play out in cramped, restrictive playing arenas too, which keeps the action fast and tight. However, Blast Factor's battlezone is a Petri dish with your ship zapping microscopic bad guys which explode in a shower of particles when hit. Not a million mile away from Mutant Storm's alien invasion but a slight difference nonetheless.   As for the enemies, they're actually quite varied, from the usual laser fodder grunts to bosses that have weak spots to discover and attack patterns to learn. Naturally, with this running on PS3 there's plenty of processing power to call upon so some of the later levels are absolutely infested with the little buggers. If you want a challenge, you've come to the right place.   Another element that adds to the difficulty, and aids Blast Factors's attempts to stand out from the likes of Mutant Storm, is the inclusion of branching routes through the zones - known here as 'specimens'. Each specimen is made up of twelve levels, a bonus area and a boss. However, depending on your performance, you'll take a different route through each specimen. By destroying all the enemies within a time limit and without getting killed yourself, you're taken along the hard path. If you fail to beat the time you're taken to the medium area, whereas those weaklings that die must hang their head in shame on the easy level. This adds plenty of replay value to Blast Factor because you won't see all the levels in one play and getting to the harder stages in all seven specimens is a tough task.   Earlier levels like this aren't too difficult to beat.  However, although the branching routes are one of Blast Factor's strongest points, the level design itself is certainly one of its weakest. Each stage is confined to a hexagonal Petri dish, with enemies filtering in from all sides. That's what happens on stage one and that's what happens on the final stage too. There's no variation in levels apart from the amount and types of enemies. This is made glaringly obvious by the fact you're forced to start at stage one every time you want to play. Although you might have reached specimen six previously, you can't warp straight there next time you start playing.    To liven things up a bit, there are three different speed settings to choose from before heading off on your mission to squish the viruses. This adds a nice extra level of longevity to Blast Factor, particularly for those determined to get high scores, because you're awarded multiplier bonuses for completing specimens on the fastest paces.   Furthermore, Blast Factor continues its attempts to stand out from the shooting pack by dabbling with some SIXAXIS motion-sensing shenanigans. By tilting the pad left or right, a powerful wave sweeps across the screen and pushes enemies in the direction it's travelling. Tactically, this adds an interesting element to gameplay because, when surrounded by foes, you can quickly tilt the pad and propel them to the other side of the screen, ready to be shot down. Plus, some enemies can only be killed by titling the SIXAXIS because it flips them over, exposing their weak points.   To best these filthy viruses you must slow down time and shoot.  Although it's good to see developer Bluepoint Games trying to implement something different in the shoot-'em-up genre, the SIXAXIS functionality does feel like it was tacked on at the last minute. Tilting is imprecise and regularly sends a wave rushing across the screen in the opposite direction to that which you intended. It's also triggered accidentally by moving the pad too vigorously while playing. This is incredibly frustrating because the wave can send enemies crushing straight into your ship and there's nothing you can do to prevent it - which is the last thing you want when trying to complete the hard stages.   An element that works a lot better is the inclusion of a special pulse move that slows down time for a few seconds. This can be used to dodge out of situations when multiple enemies are on your tail and is much safer than the tilting tactic. Although hardcore shooter fans might feel the time pulse feature detracts from the intensity of the balls-to-the-wall blasting, it's certainly a useful addition for inexperienced players who need easing into a world of bullets and high scores.   In the future this is how doctors will cure diseases.  While we're on the subject of Blast Factor's more positive additions, it's worth noting that the European version comes complete with two multiplayer options - a co-op mode and versus match, both for up to four players. Those poor saps in America had to pay an additional $2.99 to get their mitts on the multiplayer expansion weeks after the game was available for download. With these extra modes, the European Blast Factor feels like a more complete package and adds a great deal of value to the already reasonable 3.49 price tag.   However even with its low cost, Blast Factor never quite reaches the dizzy heights of fellow downloadable shooters Mutant Storm Reloaded and Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved. Until the final couple of stages, it lacks the intensity of either of those titles. Experienced players can easily breeze through earlier levels while racking up extra ships in preparation for the more challenging later stages. As a result, Blast Factor isn't a game for the hardcore shoot-'em-up crowd. Instead, it's a diverting action game that's enjoyable for short bursts of laser blasting. Unfortunately though, without a similar incentive to Geometry Wars and Mutant Storm's Xbox 360 Achievements, there's simply no compulsive reason to keep bettering your skills.Ultimately, Blast Factor is a fun but fairly shallow game that definitely doesn't have the same impact as the all-conquering Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved did when it launched alongside the Xbox 360. What's more, some of its attempts to spice up the shooter formula work better than others  like the branching stages rather than the wobbly SIXAXIS stuff. For 3.49 though, theres no arguing that Blast Factor offers decent value for money, especially as Europe gets the multiplayer modes included. However, with a much too forgiving difficulty level and little incentive for self-improvement, it's shot down by the likes of Geo Wars or Mutant Storm.", "date": "Mar 20, 2007"}
