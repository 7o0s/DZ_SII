An RPG game? That takes place in the future, on the Internet? What the heck? Surely a 2D beast like the Game Boy Advance deserves something more expected, like the next original action platformer, perhaps? But now that Mega Man Battle Network is available in the US (after waiting nearly eight months after the Japanese release), I'm welcoming this game with great, big, open arms. The story may be a bit goofy and will end up dated in the next couple of years, but Capcom has put together a solid role-playing game with a very unique combat system that makes the game a heck of a lot of fun, even for folks who don't really dig these types of games. FeaturesMore than 175 battle chips to collectLink cable support to trade chips to friendsBattery saveOnly for Game Boy AdvanceThrow away what you know about the Mega Man series. It makes no difference in Mega Man Battle Network, as the game's main focus is the lead character: a kid named Lan. Lan's just a school boy in the future, with a virtual computer pal named Mega Man. It's a bit like Tron, but the Programs (of which Mega Man is one of them) actually chum around with their Users. Society as a whole is now completely integrated into the Internet, and these computer pals (known as PETs) are the owner's access to the Net. So when Lan needs to ~jack in~, Mega Man takes over in the virtual world, wandering around in a similar interface...it just looks more futuristic and stuff.But there's an organization out there in this world set out to control the world through the network by installing devastating viruses into every unit that has a port to the net. As Lan, it's up to you to figure out what this group is trying to do and attempt to stop their evil ways...and you'll do this with Mega Man at your side. Mega Man is the only guy who can really stop the threat of all the mean, vicious viruses on the Net, but you'll need to jump in and out of the virtual world so that you can feed your Mega Man from one system to the next. There are ~bridge~ areas that you can access from your own computer systems, so if you found, say, an access point from a friend's computer system to the net, you can ~bookmark~ this area so that you can wander into that system from your own bedroom computer.The game is of the typical Japanese RPG fare -- wander around hostile area until you stumble into a random battle sequence, but at least Capcom went a bit more ambitious by offering an angled, isometric perspective over the standard overhead, big-headed character style that most RPGs use. But what really makes Mega Man Battle Network is the game's excellent battle interface. This game throws out the whole rock-paper-scissors style fight engine that most Japanese RPGs have relied on for years. Capcom created a new real-time fight interface that fits the Mega Man character and series extremely well. At the beginning of a battle, players will choose battle chips that can be activated during battle. Normally, only one chip can be sent to the brawl, but using a little strategy (i.e. two of the same chips, or two of the same type chips) players can piggyback other chips into the list to give Mega Man extra firepower. In the battle sequence, players can move Mega Man over the red squares on the grid, utilizing his standard blaster to peck at the enemies in the fight. But it's the battle chips that really do the most damage, and the strategy is to pick the right chip for the right enemy and situation. Some enemies can remove grid squares from play, making it impossible for Mega Man to move to these sectors during the fight. Others can leap out of their area and into Mega Man's temporarily, so players must learn to keep their blue guy moving so he doesn't take too much damage in the battle. As players wander around the game's world, both ~real~ and ~virtual~, they'll stumble upon battle chips that can be collected and placed into the battle folder -- only a specific amount of chips can be accessed during fights, so it's another strategic element to know which chip does what, which are needed and which are not...sort of like how Pokmon freaks pick which Pokmon to use throughout their Pokmon adventure. And like Pokemon, the link cable comes into play for gamers to trade with buddies, swapping their common battle chips for ones that they couldn't find in their own copy of the game. It's this fight interface that gives Mega Man Battle Network its overall charm and makes the game a lot of fun to play through.If there is a complaint, it's in the game's overall ~kiddy~ feel with a storyline that could end up dated in a couple of years (just like Tron is, almost two decades later). The developers injected so much ~net speak~ into the game...like the use of a computer term for each of the character's name in the game. And Capcom's kind of pulling a bit of a bait and switch move with its Mega Man brand -- folks will pick this title up for the Mega Man character expecting a specific style of gameplay, and they'll be faced with a slower-paced (but admittedly excellent) game design.I was definitely surprised how much I enjoyed playing through Mega Man Battle Network, as I was openly annoyed at what GBA owners would get as the first Mega Man game. Though its not the classic Mega Man we all know and love, it is a very good design with very little to dislike...other than the fact that this isn't a ~true~ Mega Man game.", "date": "Nov 10, 2001"}
