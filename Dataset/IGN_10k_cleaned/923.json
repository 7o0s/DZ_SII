The fact that Americans have the opportunity to play this obscure but absorbing game series is a testament to the power of niche gamers. Harvest Moon is a farming game, and it requires the same patience and wearisome toil that actual farm work demands -- bliss for adventurous gamer. Features:  New gameplay based on the SNES and N64 games New tools and seeds to help cultivate your farm Choose a female or male farmer, and pick a cat or dog as your pet Talk to villagers, neighborhood ladies, and ranch gnomes For Game Boy and Game Boy Color    Telling the story of a farmer/farmer-ette who inherits the family ranch from their ancestor, Harvest Moon really is about farming (I just thought I'd reiterate that for those who've never heard of this game and thought the intro was joking). Players begin the game with nothing but a shed full of rusty tools, a few loose coins, and a pet. It's your job to till the land, clear out all the obstacles, pick up and plant seeds, and harvest the crops. If all goes well and the farm sprouts (after constant care on your part), you can bring on cattle and chickens to raise and reap the rewards of your labor.  The charm in Harvest Moon is in its silly Japanese roots. The graphics are colorful and cartoonish, with anime-styled characters (including a few adorable women). The visuals go well to complement the bizarre and whimsical gameplay, which eventually includes tool shed gnomes, a blessed cow, an earthquake that reveals a harvest goddess, and the ghost of your ancestor who judges your accomplishments. It's such a pleasant game that you could play it forever, and in a nice touch by the game's designers, Harvest Moon no longer ends once players have reached the end of their evaluated season (you can even trade farms with other Harvest Masters via the Game Link Cable!)  Sadly, the Game Boy version of Harvest Moon is a stripped-down version from the N64 and SNES versions, which were already lean enough as it was. The biggest omission is the dating sim aspect. Farmers can complicate their ranch and run themselves completely out, but they never have a personal life like in the original. Gamers do meet ladies and help them out, but never win their affection.  That dating aspect tremendously complicated Harvest Moon, and the Game Boy Color version (which also works fine on the standard Game Boy, a sign of why it may be lacking) gets even more exasperating quickly than the other versions. There are a scant few mini-quests, and the repetitive gameplay is only broken up by visitors on a few occasions. The town has only shopkeepers, and they always say the same thing. Unless you take frequent breaks, you may get so lonely that you start talking to your livestock... I did, and I'm still not sure whether it was my imagination or not that they spoke back.A strange but wonderful Japanese import that absolutely clashes with the American aesthetic of gaming (violence and graphic pizzazz), the Harvest Moon series is a brilliant and engrossing alternative. If you've been through the desert on a horse with no name, and think it'd feel good to be out of the rain , a couple of seasons in Harvest Moon may do you good.However, the Game Boy Color version is a very simple version of the series, and a slightly buggy one at that (none of these bugs ruin the game, but it is a little jolting when your cat suddenly turns into a dog in mid-game). Without the dating aspects and with only a few mini-quests to play through, Harvest Moon GBC is a lightweight version of a feathery game. The sequel will hopefully fill in the gaps. Until then, unfortunately, what's missing is the game's dating sim, and I doubt new Harvesters will be able to fall in love with this version of the game if they can't fall in love while playing. However, if you're already become smitten by Harvest Moon, then the Game Boy version is a great way to keep that love in a pocket close to your heart.", "date": "May 5, 2000"}
