Cash Guns Chaos DLX is most certainly one of the latter. A blatant swindle of Midway's classic arcade hits Smash TV and Total Carnage, this reengineered version of an eventual PSP game doesn't give the fledgling PlayStation Network a very positive image. It's boring, predictable, unnecessarily frustrating, and above all else, repetitive.   But let's back up a step. Assuming that you've never played Smash TV or Total Carnage before, let's recap what Cash Guns Chaos is all about: An alien race has kidnapped your disco king main character and teleported him into the middle of a brutal 1970s-style game show. The only way to survive this cheesy over the top version of ~The Running Man,~ is to blast your way through hordes of various enemy types with your trusty gun until there's nothing left to kill. Plus, like Smash TV before it, you'll earn plenty of money, prizes, and weapon power-ups along the way.   Like 1/3 of all downloadable titles in history, Cash Guns Chaos relies on a dual analog stick configuration to drive its action. The L-stick handles movement and the R-stick fires your weapon (whatever it might be), and luckily, most of the upgrades you'll gain access too are actually fun to fire. Machine guns, rocket launchers, rapid-fire blasters, and a couple of other popular cannon types all make their way in to the game sooner or later. Unfortunately, none of these weapons last very long once fire and, most of the time, you're stuck with the default pea shooter which is nowhere near as fun to use.    But the weapons are just a small problem, as Cash Guns Chaos runs into much bigger issues with its level design and enemy selection. That is, it has none and you can't really tell what you're fighting. These two problems work in a symbiotic relationship and actually feed off of each other by getting worse and worse as time goes on. More specifically, as one plays through the game's three seasons (15 levels in all), the arenas never evolve beyond that of a modified box or rectangle. What's worse is that each stage has a money requirement that players have to meet before they can move on to the next section -- but the prerequisites take forever to reach (most boxes take roughly 7-10 minutes to beat) and if you die once, you have to start that leg all over again even if you met requirement and were just waiting for the clock to tick down.   As you can imagine, that sort of scenario gets monotonous and fast. But the aforementioned enemy selection amplifies the tedium because your foes will typically materialize on top of you while blending into the environment (the shades of red and green are similar between the levels themselves and the units, resulting in constantly-camouflaged opponents amidst a sea of blood and grass). Now imagine repeating scenarios like those described above and extend them for an hour or two... if that doesn't sound fun to you it's because it isn't. To the game's merit, the occasional boss battle does help break the perpetual sameness that Cash Guns presents, but after fighting hundreds of beach ball things, multiplying mushrooms, and automatons that look like clowns, it's a small victory.   The icing on the cake, though, is the fact that the developers have had no qualms in pillaging Smash TV idea in every presentational way possible. Shooting a billion things at once while a smarmy announcer spouts one-liners wouldn't be complete unless you had while you had cheesy prizes and piles of cash to roll over in the process, now would it? Sure it's fun for a couple of minutes, but not much longer.Smash TV worked because it constantly switched up enemy and power-up types in quick 30-second rooms that would branch out into all-new areas immediately afterward. But Cash Guns Chaos doesn't do that. Instead, we're stuck in flat, uninteresting squares with limited visibility and enemies that match their environments so closely that they become impossible to see. Boss battles and gun upgrades are fun, yes, but they happen so infrequently that they're not worth fighting for. Perhaps this one will get better in 2007 when it will benefit from expanded options and stages via cross-platform compatibility with the PSP version -- but for now, it isn't worth the time it takes to download.", "date": "Nov 22, 2006"}
