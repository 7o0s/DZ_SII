If it were up to me, that would be my whole review but Trent says it needs a little more meat. I tend to think it makes the point quite well.  Here's the boring part. Recoil is a tank game. It's you, alone, piloting one lone tank against, and I quote, ~sinister forces that have taken over a network of computers that control all systems.~ That's about it as far as background. You are contacted from the future by three dissidents who want you to take control of the Battle Force Tank, or BTF (or bacon, tomato and feta), through your computer. And you thought it was tough trying to connect to those Australian porn sites. Try dialing up a futuristic wonder tank. Then you can complain.  Now for the great part. Recoil is really a hybrid. First off, it's pretty thoughtful game. You need to thing things through before you go charging off into the jaws of death. But it's also a game of intense, frantic action. Here's how it works: You formulate what you consider to be a reasonable and thorough plan and put it into action. Suddenly it all goes terribly and completely wrong. Once the smoke clears you start all over again. Make a new plan...etc. Who was it who said ~No plan ever survives contact with the enemy?~ Give that guy a raise. He's on to something.  Your job is to drive into six successive battle zones. The ~sinister forces~ (snicker) have seized several installations and it's up to you to liberate them. They own missile silos, power plants, mining operations, etcetera. There are several different parts to each mission-blow up the force field to get to the power plant to shut off the power to disarm the missiles that were aimed at the house that Jack built. You get the idea. At the end of each zone, you are airlifted to the next and the whole process starts over again.  The controls are pretty basic. You have one set for the base of the tank and another for the turret. I found that using the arrow keys to steer the tank and the mouse to point the turret worked extremely well. There are a few other options here but none of them seemed to work as well.  Driving the tank is great fun. It goes at a pretty good speed and you can get some truly awesome slides and skids out of it. Sliding's an excellent maneuver to use right after you've sped past someone. Just turn hard and swing the turret around until they're dead in your sights. It's also a great move to escape the guided missiles some of your opponents carry. The BFT can also ramp up onto higher structures. You'd be surprised how much air a tank can get off of a small hill. I was jumping onto the tops of buildings with ease once I got the hang of it. Soon after I was jumping from building to building a la Streets of San Francisco.  The BFT also drives well in its other modes. What's that, you say... other modes? You got it. You will find upgrades that will convert your tank into an amphibious vehicle, a hover vehicle and, yes, even a submersible vehicle. Each modification is necessary to complete one or more of your mission objectives. The best is the amphibious mode. The powerslides out on the water are a sight to behold. Now I understand why people go four wheeling.  You'll also need to pick up weapons. After all, this ain't strictly a drivin' game. You're here to make war, soldier! Get on board! Join in for the big win! You can get missiles and mines, napalm and freon cannons, a multiple targeting electronic blast, and over a dozen others.  The basic weapon is the enhanced rapid fire pulse gun (ERFPG) It replaces the plain ol' RFPG. The RFPG is weak but it is the only weapon you have that has unlimited ammo. You must find ammunition for the other weapons. Usually this isn't so hard. Most enemies leave a little something behind when you send them to that great tank sim in the sky.  Before you worry about ammo, you need to actually find the launchers to all of these weapons. They're scattered around the mission maps, and you won't necessarily find them just because you completed all the mission objectives. They're hidden all over the mission maps. You'll also need to pick up shield power. You're going to get tagged...a lot. These guys don't let up and if you don't watch after your shields, you'll be sorry you didn't cash in your life insurance and take that big vacation last month.  The enemies are all dangerous but some are more so than others. The most common is a light and agile halftrack armed with an ERFPG. This guy is tough because he strikes so quickly and he's likely to divert your attention away from other threats. Even so, they weren't more than a nuisance to me.  To be honest, I was too busy looking out for missile tanks. These boys are small and low to the ground. Rarely do you see them until you're right up on them. By then...well, good luck. They're pretty thinly armored, but are proof positive of the maxim ~A good offense is the best defense.~ They are armed with guided missiles so running probably won't help. The best you can do is close your eyes and start swinging.  In addition to all these mobile enemies, you've also got to keep you eyes open for stationary turrets and missile launchers. These are put in the greatest places. They're all either up on hills or just around the corner. Often they're put so that they are right behind you once you drive into a new area. If you spot them first and have the leisure to do so, you may snipe them from very far away.  If you do any sniping, watch out for the helicopters. Luckily there are only a few of these guys per level. If you park long enough, they'll fly up and stick it to you like that's their only reason for living. By the time you realize you've been sitting still for too long, it's too late. These guys are normally impossible to hit but once you get guided missiles, it's payback time!  The mission worlds are fairly large and full of several distinct areas. This makes each mission seem like its own mini-campaign. It took me several sessions just to get through a couple of missions. The first few missions all take place mostly outside in the country. Later missions take you into the city. You drive your BFT down city streets, stomping everything in your path. Luckily the only things in your path are enemies.  The worlds all have lots of detail-not only in terms of graphics, but also in terms of design. There were all sorts of alcove and ridges scattered across the landscape. Each one could be used for an ambush. There are several different vertical levels to each mission. You had better use the hills and rooftops to your advantage. If you'd prefer to hide, you can park under a bridge or drive into a dried out riverbed.  The detail in the backgrounds is rivaled by the great looking vehicles and snappy weapon effects. Each weapon is unique in sound and look. The BFT changes to reflect damage status. You can see little pockmarks on the shell where you have been hit.  So I really liked this game. Are there any problems with it? Sure. I'm still shocked that the story is so lame but in all fairness, I wasn't thinking about the story when I was playing. Unfortunately, the game's bugs did make me pause for thought. It's got plenty of 'em.  Most of the game's bugs have to do with the steering of the tank. You can get stuck in areas where you can't escape. I'm not talking about poor driving on your part. I've been stuck against the edges of buildings, cliff edges and in one particularly aggravating instance I was stuck to the side of a door jamb. Fortunately, jumping back and forth between menus usually pushed the tank out of these situations.  Okay, I've said all I needed to say and it looks like Trent's going to let me get back to playing the game. The bottom line is that, apart from the bugs (and that God-awful storyline), Recoil looks and plays great. Now if you'll excuse me, I hear there's a tether-guided tactical nuke launcher out there for me...  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Apr 3, 1999"}
