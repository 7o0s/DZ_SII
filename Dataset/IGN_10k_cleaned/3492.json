But for a real pocket-sized dose of monkey madness, peel yourself a download of SEGA Mobile's cellphone-only Super Monkey Ball.  Features Fifteen different levels New obstacles like wind, ice, and un-yummy black bananas Auto-save Designed specifically for Sprint PCS Vision phones and AT&T Wireless mMode phones  The major difference between all previous versions of Super Monkey Ball and the cellphone rendition is the perspective. No longer are your eyes behind the ball--this is a strictly top-down affair. The board is only the size of the screen, and you can see it in its entirely at all times. While this certainly eliminates the requisite need for complaining about the camera you'll find in most game reviews, it also really throws some distance between you and the game. I dunno how emotionally involved you became with Ai Ai's plight, but there was certainly some guilt felt in my office when his little monkey mug went sailing into the day-glo yonder.  Thanks to the smaller display, you can barely make out Ai Ai's face on the small boards.  The boards range from ridiculously simple to aggravatingly hard. The first few rounds are completed by simply rolling across a few bananas before reaching the goal. Then, insidious little environmental effects and hazards start impeding your progress, such as blocks that must be pushed out of the way (in proper order, of course) and ice slicks that make stopping perilous. Wind also tries to blow your little monkey, and sand traps make it slow-going for your simian. You'll often find that many of these hazards are designed to force you to roll over black bananas, an unsavory cuisine that renders your monkey temporarily unstable, and gives you a little jolt by making the phone vibrate. (Why can't my little monkey munch black 'naners while my phone is in my front pocket?)  Control becomes an issue in the mobile SMB. The GameCube's analog control stick was perfect for rolling your imprisoned pal around obstacle courses. Only one cellphone that supports SMB, Samsung's N400 (Sprint PCS Vision-enabled), even has a tiny joystick for maneuvering the monkey. And that stick ain't analog, so it's impossible to just nudge Ai Ai along as needed. You're either moving or your not, and you leave a lot up to inertia. The rest of the AT&T and Sprint phones that play SMB use itty-bitty touch pads for control, and it takes serious practice to master the fine art of monkey moving before you can breeze through all fifteen rounds.  Visually, SMB looks pretty solid for one of SEGA Mobile's first efforts. The visuals are very well done. Bananas look like bananas, ice looks like ice, snozzberries look like, ahem. Depending on your screen, the colors are bright and clear. Both Samsung phones, the N400 and the A500 look incredibly sharp, but I wouldn't throw rocks at the Motorla T750, either. The sound is pretty limited, as with most wireless games (save for Nokia's new N-Gage).  There's plenty of beeping associated with nabbing a 'nana or crossing the goal line.  Super Monkey Ball costs $3.99 a month on Sprint PCS Vision-enabled phones. AT&T charges $5.99 for the game, but if you delete from your phone after sixty days, you must re-purchase the game should you want to download it again.Let's be honest, the wireless version of SMB isn't going to replace the GameCube version, or even the GBA version, as your Super Monkey Ball of choice. But should you find yourself stuck on the bus or in an airport terminal without a GBA, it's a pleasant distraction. Although, you should probably sit away from other people, as you might find yourself muttering a blue streak the first time you try to negotiate an ice patch with that little touch pad.", "date": "Mar 13, 2003"}
