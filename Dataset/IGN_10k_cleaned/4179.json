Just like the beautiful cycles of life in nature, older hits relive their previous lives with better graphics. Crash Nitro Kart takes this process to its PS one predecessor, Crash Team Racing, giving the older racer a spit shine and a couple new tricks. Other than that, there is nothing groundbreaking here and if you're a fan of the genre you know just what to expect since it's almost exactly the same as most of the rest.It could be argued, if it even needs to be, that the original CTR itself was a remake of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64.  All of the same elements are in these games: power-sliding, power-ups, and big-headed cartoon characters sitting behind the wheels of itty bitty sports karts that make Shriners drool with envy. Where the Mario Kart series has aimed for the multiplayer experience by providing tracks that can be played smoothly with four people, the Crash series has gone the single-player route, cooking up an Adventure mode that rewards extensive replays of the tracks to find tons of hidden secrets and getting faster times on the tracks.GameplayThe essential elements of CNK are just like the original. Adventure Mode takes a tour of 17 different tracks in five different worlds. Races are either against a field of seven others or up against a boss character. Once these races have been completed, the real work begins.The rest of the single-player game requires learning the different tracks inside and out. Relic races can be won by shaving race times down to the bare minimums with fast racing and hitting boxes that temporarily stop the clock. Progress is only granted by focusing intently on each track to find all the secrets and create a three-lap long line that will hit most, if not all, of the time boxes.Of course, it wouldn't be a kart game without the power-ups and they're all here. Missiles, traps, invincibility, tornadoes, and time stoppers are included. There's been a slight change from the original line-up, but nothing too major. The main difference here is the team power-up meter. Stick close to teammates and you'll get the ability to launch unlimited power-ups. I thought this would be pretty cool, but noticed a quick flaw in the system. Before too long, a nitro boost would come up and it would zip me away from my teammates, ending the team boost. It was a neat idea, but nothing that changes the game in any major way.  One thing that hasn't been changed at all is the pacing of the game. Racing is a bit of a loose term because the karts don't go all that fast. By timing your powerslides just right you earn boosts, and by linking these boosts together you create combos to maintain maximum speed. In this way, the game can be sped up a bit and it's key to getting the faster times. It just doesn't feel all that fast, though. The game is more of a tactical game than a racing game, using strategy to get the boosts to line-up.As for the computer AI, it's limited. It's set up to match a certain speed no matter what you do. One infuriating thing is that the computer characters never use the slide boosts. They just drive along, faster than you. Fortunately, there is no rubber-banding effect keeping the computer enemies close by as it is possible to leave the others in the dust. In a sense, the computer and I were playing a different game entirely. It would have been better if the computer had the same speed and used the same techniques, then I could understand why I was behind. Getting to the lead is entirely a process of self-discovery. If I saw a computer character breaking off and using a shortcut I could see how he could go from last to first in a quick loop. They could also learn from the new paths that the human player discovers. Find a shortcut and if any other player saw you, they would start to mimic you.    The single-player game boils down to a constant quest to get faster and faster, honing your skills to a fine point. It would have been great if the computer players ramped up their skills as well and gave a good fight, but once I surpassed their abilities it was a battle against myself.What was left to explore was the multiplayer and especially the race mode to duke it out with friends. While the racing tracks looked great and were smooth in single-player, the detail choked the graphics engine with four players on screen at once. To have a smooth game, the maximum number of players is three. The best race is by far the one-on-one mode, where the graphics are not significantly shrunk down.Five different battle modes have been included, but only two of them really catch fire. These were slight variations on the theme of attacking each other. So instead of racing, we got to blow each other up and set up traps all over a small board. Even this got to grow old a little fast because the main attack is to get a homing missile and fire it at someone who's close by. This combination of racing in circles and simple shooting doesn't provide a lot of depth and quickly becomes a side diversion if you get tired of the racing.GraphicsThe graphics create a vivid cartoony world. This is the biggest addition or change to the series, if you can call it that, and it's done well. Each track takes a tour of a different environment and the different tracks have a huge difference in design. While the different locations are about as  clich as can be (island, castle, futuristic track, etc.) at least they look good.The crucial flaw is the multiplayer graphics. With four people racing, the graphics started to chug along and make us look for something, anything, else to do. Bumping the action down to two-player for the races was the best solution, but it's the four-person free-for-all that we really wanted.It would have been nicer if there was more eye candy for the attacks and special weapons. Speed boosts could warp the screen, explosions could be more dramatic, and the tornado could be changed to something besides a gray spiral moving along the track. As it stands, most of the effects are pretty basic and don't create a sense of chaos that this cartoon environment demands.  SoundThe audio is filled with a pile of Looney Tunes-style repartee and sound effects. Geared toward a younger audience, all of the characters have very cute phrases as they zoom by or launch an attack. The saving grace is that it was done professionally and while it's pretty silly if you listen to it, it doesn't grate and get under the skin as other games can. Fugitive Hunter, for example.The music is bouncy and peppy and, once again, cartoony. Warping together Saturday morning with some '70s lounge effects, it's almost perfect for a comic book cocktail party. As for racing karts, it works along with the action nicely.CNK is a solid adaptation of a PSOne game. The problem is that the same exact game has been made dozens of times and CNK does very little to further the cause. It's a kart racing game like any other.If you truly love kart titles, and I do mean love them, this provides some alternative types of gameplay and rewards pulling the maximum potential out of the little kart. Overall, CNK is a worthy transition stage to a, hopefully, much better game.", "date": "Nov 12, 2003"}
