In an ideal world, someone somewhere would offer some kind of dial-an-escapologist service, meaning we'd never have to climb through toilet windows, feign a family emergency or endure Kate Winslet for more than a nano-second ever again.   Sadly, it's not an ideal world - and that's why we play videogames! Thankfully, what with there being a game out there to satisfy almost every conceivable fantasy we might have (apart from that one with the snowboard and kazoo), there's Exit 2 - following the exploits of one-man rescue team for hire, Mr. ESC. Of course, it's the sequel to Taito's surprisingly entertaining PSP puzzler - a game which managed to divide opinion quite sharply, thanks to its fiendishly imaginative level design and some overly finicky controls.   Companions like to say the same sample every second or so. Let them die.  We'll save you some time here - don't expect too many revelations if you already know which side of the fence you were on first time around. To recap though, as with the original, Exit 2's one hundred levels (plus additional downloadable content) task you with rescuing a set number of 'companions' from disaster before the time limit runs out. The series' puzzle component is present in the form of intricately designed levels, requiring careful navigation and the exploitation of your companions' varying abilities. At its simplest, the idea is to traverse a level, nudging your companions into action, then guiding the pre-specified quota to the Emergency Exit at the end of an area within the time limit.   Behold: a new level theme. Elsewhere, find items to overcome obstacles.  Once again, levels are packed with all manner of obstacles - ranging from movable blocks, seemingly impassable gaps, scale-like platforms affected by weight to ladders and ropes. While Mr. ESC can tackle most of this himself, some situations demand careful people management and multi-tasking for success. You see, each type of companion you encounter - be they rotund adults, youths, children and the incapacitated, or the new ~macho~ and canine comrades - has his or her own unique abilities. Children, for instance, can squeeze through small gaps and move across weight-restricted walkways, while dogs can swim or bound over large chasms. Meanwhile, machos are able to perform maneuvers normally requiring two people - such as pushing large blocks.   While many tasks can be accomplished by controlling Mr. ESC directly, later levels demand the full use of your companions' abilities in order to reach your goal. For instance, although you can reach a comrade yourself, it might require the strength of a macho to push a block into place and create a step to get them down from a high ledge. To this end, Exit 2 features a point and click-style command interface for interacting with your companions. Using the PSP's nubbin, you can highlight a comrade and click in a new spot to direct their movement, pick up an object or trigger a switch. Needless to say, careful assessment, pre-planning and execution are the order of the day in Exit 2.     So far, so familiar if you've played the original Exit - and that, unfortunately, is Exit's 2 greatest strength and biggest weakness. While the game's presentation and puzzles are of undoubtedly high quality - with the latter much trickier than in the original - many of the first game's frustrating design quirks still remain. For instance, companion AI is still a little wonky, requiring you to split actions up into sections before they respond appropriately. So, rather than directing them down a ladder to push a block, it's necessary to get them down first before demanding some shunting action - attempt it all at once and they're easily confused.   What's more, Mr. ESC's responsiveness still plays second fiddle to his admittedly impressive animations. While it's now possible to switch direction halfway up a staircase or a ladder (instead of having to wait it out every time you accidentally send him off the wrong way), you still have to endure some overly elaborate maneuvers while your protagonist shimmies up boxes or swings over ledges.   Platforming elements have been toned down, but jumping is still unwieldy.  It mightn't seem like too much of an issue, but proceedings can feel a bit stop-start, lacking the control fluidity and precision needed when you're up against tight time limits - one accidental move and you'll invariably waste precious seconds as Mr. ESC faffs his way over scenery. Whether it's turning on the spot or grappling an overhead object, animation always takes precedent - sure, it looks pretty, but when the lack of responsiveness causes you to plummet to your doom for the dozenth time right near the end of a particularly tricky level, you'll be painting the air blue with profanities. Thankfully though, Taito has toned down many of the more demanding platform elements of the original, placing the focus on puzzle-solving - in other words, Mr. ESC's protracted acrobatics aren't so much of a headache anymore.   If you got bored of block-shoving in the 90s, you might want to steer clear of Exit 2.  Still potentially problematic, depending on your patience, is the inherent trial and error nature of gameplay, often leading to furious bouts of restarting as you make another wrong move at a critical point in a level. Again, if you managed to overlook this first time around, you'll be fine here - it just would have been nice to get some kind of feedback from the game when an incorrect action renders a level impossible to complete. As before, success relies on careful pre-planning - and better tools should really be available by now. While there's a readily accessible map showing the bare bones of a level, it doesn't indicate obstacles in your path. As before, you can use the nubbin-mounted mouse pointer to scroll around, but it's locked to a limited distance from Mr. ESC.Ultimately though, these are relatively minor, far-from-insurmountable issues. Sure, when taken together, they're problems which make Exit 2 more frustrating than it needs to be - particularly disappointing given the opportunity to fix these flaws for this sequel. However, patience and smart forward thinking - both of which you'll need in abundance for a game of this nature anyway - make most niggles easy to avoid. If you're the sort of person who thrives on the intense satisfaction invariably present when you complete the game's trickier levels, it's hard not to recommend Exit 2 for it's impressively constructed puzzle action. As before, Taito has excelled on the presentation front, creating a charming, uniquely-styled package. Yes, we have reservations about certain returning gameplay mechanics, but the underlying puzzle component is so strong, we still think genre fans should get a kick out of Exit 2. Third time around though Taito, and we might not be so lenient.", "date": "Apr 10, 2007"}
