Times have changed since those ~teenagers with attitudes~ from Angel Grove donned the checkered colored spandex to thwart the evil Rita Repulsa and her Putty Patrol, and it's hard to keep track of just who are the folks under the ever-changing helmets now. Apparently in Power Rangers: Wild Force, these colorful Kung Fu experts are now some sort of eco-activists, out to wipe out the bad guys who threaten to destroy nature. Unfortunately, thwarting these bad guys takes only a couple of hours on the Game Boy Advance, and honestly, it's not that exciting a task. Features Six playable characters Ten stages Link cable support for four players Password save Only for Game Boy Advance Power Rangers: Wild Force was developed by Natsume, the Japanese development studio that's handled the portable Power Rangers adventures on the Game Boy Color. For the company's first Game Boy Advance Rangers title (the first Power Rangers GBA title was handled by Vicarious Visions), the team designed a beat-em-up in that familiar 3D-but-not-really isometric perspective. It's a bit like Final Fight but shot at an overhead angle. Players choose their Ranger and build their team of three other Rangers that they can call upon for some teamwork special attacks; call upon the yellow ranger, for example, and you both can run like freaks at enemies and close-line 'em. The blue ranger can fire a charged energy ball at enemies, taking out a bunch at a time if it's aimed properly. When each level's boss is defeated, the game goes into ~Canned Animation Sequence Mode~ (repetitive but very appropriate if you're looking to recreate the feel of the Rangers shows in videogame form), and then the challenge is to defeat the super-sized version of this boss with your equally supersized MegaZord in a one-on-one battle.  Now, when playing a Power Rangers game, one has to note that the game is obviously aimed at the younger crowd. Maybe the kids love repetitive one-button action, I guess, because the main level design in Wild Force is incredibly tedious, monotonous...the only variety comes from the background graphics. No matter where you're fighting you're doing exactly the same thing: walking up to the same drawn gray enemy and pressing the A button until he's kissing the canvas...when he's out cold, he melts out of play, making way for additional enemy sprites. Repeat. By hitting the R button, you can thwak these bad guys in one shot with a super move...the limitation here is that your power bar for special moves diminishes. But it only diminishes when the attack connects, so you can simply wail on the shoulder button without worry. And because the game drops power-meter replenishing power-ups as frequently as Alpha says ~Ai-yay-yay,~ there's no need to conserve this power that ultimately reduces the game's lastability down to almost zero.  The MegaZord battles are a little better, but even these have their own little quirks that make the strategy a snap to pin down. By getting enough hits in, the player can get in a super move by following a sequence of button presses in proper timing. Think Dance Dance Revolution with giant robots. The first level's really just a training to show players just how easy it is to win the game; basically, players just block until there's an opening, then punch at the opponent. And then finish him with those super moves when they pop up.  But it's not all bad: Natsume really put a lot of work into the link cable play, so much that it actually feels like a four-player console game when all systems are connected. Each player takes control of their own ranger in this brawler and competes in defeating the most bad guys...by coming in first with the most ~kills~, the winner will be the one that controls the MegaZord in the boss battles. A nifty incentive to steal a few kills from your ~teammates.~ Unfortunately, to take advantage of this feature everyone needs their own copy of the cartridge...and finding a group of people that would actually want to keep this game after playing through the game the first time is going to be rare indeed.  Even though it takes only a couple hours to beat the game, the adventure branches off into different parts of the city. And to complete the game a hundred percent, you'll have to play through the game twice, completing levels that you didn't storm through the first time around. A devious way to increase the lasting play, but if you're a Power Rangers fan, it is worth it, since each level awards the Rangers animal crystals which will unlock the MegaZords. There are a couple MegaZords that remain locked until you uncover the proper animal crystals...  The game's production value isn't quite up there with the current ~average,~ with lame animation of the Power Rangers (the run cycle looks like they're crawling around like chimpanzees) and NES-style music composition. The password save is a drag, but since it's only five characters long we can forgive it. Thumbs up, though, on the seamless support for that link cable...they at least got one thing right. If only it offered single cartridge multiplayer, ten times more players would be able to take advantage of this support. I admit that I haven't followed the Power Rangers since Saban ruined the whole franchise with that terrible second theatrical film. But the videogame renditions of the series haven't really made me want to get back into the whole Rangers' thing. The latest edition could have been something pretty fun had the developers added some technique to the game design...all this game requires is a quick finger on the L button and the ability to run away from bosses until your power's charged back up. Had there been stuff like punch kick combos, throw attacks, and other required moves, this game could have been a lot of fun to play through. The Megazord battles are a bit of a nice diversion, and the multiplayer support is definitely welcome, but they're not nearly enough to save this game from being a dull one-button brawler.", "date": "Sep 4, 2002"}
