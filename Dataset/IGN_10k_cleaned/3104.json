{"name": "Monopoly", "name_review": "Monopoly", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/10/24/monopoly-2", "text": "As one of the most popular and well-known board games in the world, Monopoly has seen its share of play time. There have been countless versions of the damn thing made with properties and areas from many different cities in place of the originals. And of course, there have been computer games made for those that don't have the room to actually take that huge board out of the box and spread it out on a table or floor. At least one of these games has actually been at least slightly worthwhile. That was Monopoly Tycoon. This isn't Monopoly Tycoon. This is Monopoly. Stick with the board game.   The good thing about doing a review like this is that everybody in the world knows the premise behind Monopoly. Explaining the game isn't exactly necessary. Especially since this version is the same as every board version that has ever been released.   The difference? This one is on the computer and in 3D. Apparently that's exciting. But as far as I can remember, the actual board game is in real three dimensions, having weight and height and all of that in the real world. Where this one is virtually 3D with no weight and no real height and no real class or style. It seems that if you were going to bother putting this classic game on the PC, you would sup it a little bit with some nice houses and hotels and a more interesting board of some sort. No. This looks exactly like it does in real life.   Oh wait, that's right. The tokens have cute little animations. They bounce around and roll around and distort all funny like a cartoon. Oh, that's right. Nobody gives a crap. I can imagine the tokens doing more interesting things than they did in this game and I have no imagination.   But there's the added charm of having personalities attached to the various tokens by giving them voices and cute things to say when they land on property and have to pay up. Not if they play the same damn things over and over and over again. Not if the voices you chose were lame and make me want to dive out of a two-story window that would undoubtedly hurt me in a serious way but not kill me. You know, just for the pain to clear my head.   So now that we've shown the lack of redeeming value on the visual and auditory sides of things, we'll look at the extra stuff, such as the options and whatnot. One thing the game does have is plenty of options for changing the rules and using different boards. The rules sets are completely customizable so your luxury taxes can be higher or you can play with more houses and so on and so forth. I suppose it's a convenient way of doing things so that nobody has to remember the rule changes that you decided to make. You can also play on either the classic Monopoly board or on one of the many real city boards that have been released over the years. I suppose it's kind of fun to play in your own city instead of the basic board, and having more cities in one package is kind of cool if you plan on playing Monopoly a whole lot. And I don't think anybody really plays the game all the time. I can't remember hearing of anybody having a weekly Monopoly game.   Of course, the other plus of having the game on the computer is that you can play when none of your friends are around. Although playing this game with anybody other than your friends seems a little boring to me since it's really just a way to get everybody together for some drinks and a conversation. But for those lonely lads and lasses out there, you can play either online against other lonely folks or against the lame AI of the computer.   The AI really isn't good. They divide it into three difficulty levels of ~first-time buyer~, ~entrepreneur~ or ~tycoon~ depending on what kind of competition you want. In the games I played, the first-time buyers~ seemed to last the longest however and put up the hardest bargains in trade. Although none of the damn AI would give me a fair trade. I would propose a trade that any normal sane human being would notice as being pretty good deal for them, but no. The AI never would take it unless it was way, way in their favor. Just check out the picture below of the counter offer I received after offering a reluctant computer 2000 bucks for what would have been Continental on a regular board:   Worst. Trade. Ever.  Yeah, now normally I would laugh because it would be one of my friends trying to be an asshole to me. And I would be in close enough proximity that I would be able to reach out and throttle him for his callous insult. But I can't. Because this character is just a stupid virtual wheelbarrow. You'll also get plenty of pacing problems when all of the options for the ~visual splendor~ are turned on. It takes the computer forever to sell back houses and make their damn turns... blech.  Unless you're one of the lonely people that love board games but have no one to play them with, stick to the actual boardgame. This isn't worth it unless you play the game all the damn time. Little to no imagination or creativity was pumped into this. It's like they said, ~eh... good enough~. That's a crappy way to make games. Even converted board games.", "date": "Oct 24, 2002"}
