Xbox Live Arcade needs more laid-back games for the younger set, so I welcomed the opportunity to check this one out. Five minutes later, I was shaking my head in dismay.   Rocky & Bullwinkle is a collection of ~micro games~ in the vein of Nintendo's WarioWare series, but that's where the similarity ends. The games are boring and repetitive, the animation is terrible, and the overall presentation makes poor use of the famous cartoon's license.   Speaking of which, I'm not sure why Rocky & Bullwinkle, popular in the 1960s, is the greatest choice for a 2008 videogame. The classic cartoon is endearing and iconic, but Zen Studios' presentation of the series' characters comes across as irrelevant and cheap.     The mechanics of each micro game in Rocky & Bullwinkle are extremely simplistic, from spinning the left thumbstick in a circle to mashing the left and right triggers repeatedly. Most games last a few seconds, and many are so easy that they don't qualify as games at all.    Here's a philosophical question. If a piece of software tells you to complete a task and you complete that task, is it automatically a game? What if, while I was writing this review, that awful animated paper clip guy in Microsoft Word told me to save my document? If I appease him by hitting a button, is that a game?   Sure, some tasks in Rocky & Bullwinkle qualify as games (there are mazes, shooting ranges, races, etc.) but even those are unsatisfying and, most importantly, not really any fun. That's not a very good starting position for a videogame, and with Rocky & Bullwinkle, it's all downhill from there.    This will cost you $10.   As simple as some of these micro games are, some are confusing and imprecise, even when you're not using the Xbox Live Vision camera to control the game (it seldom works). Games often repeat multiple times in a level. Those levels are arranged by ~shows~ which are themed (Aesop and Son, The Peabody Show, etc.) but there's no story arc, and the characters are wooden and unexciting.   If you want to subject 11 of your closest friends to Rocky & Bullwinkle, the option is there. The game supports a hot-seat multiplayer mode, which means passing the controller back and forth from game to game. Although there are online leaderboards, there's no Xbox Live play option, which is probably just as well.   By the time I was done with Rocky & Bullwinkle, I was not only dissatisfied but also thoroughly confused. Who is the audience for this product? The games are so simplistic that they must be aimed at children, most of whom will have no idea who these characters are. Adults who are familiar with the series will be insulted by the presentation and the childlike controls. And none of the above will have much fun with Rocky & Bullwinkle.  Zen Studios didnt spend much time or money on Rocky & Bullwinkle, so why should you?", "date": "Apr 15, 2008"}
