In fact, it's the worst of the arcade baseball games on the PC this year, and I've played them all (except for Hardball 6, which is basically just a roster update).  The game uses Shiny's Messiah engine, which for the last couple of years has been highly touted for its ability to create realistic characters. And while Messiah still isn't out yet, this is the second year that Interplay has used the Messiah engine to animate its players. This doesn't bode well for Messiah, since the players in Interplay Baseball 2000 look awful.  The seams between the different body parts--arms, legs, and hips--are glaringly noticeable. The animations, though varied and at times right on target, with players doing things that resemble real players, like the infielder holding up fingers to remind each other how many outs there--too often fall flat. The transitions between the idling animations and action animations are abrupt and not at all seamless, and when you take control of an infielder, his sudden shift from standing to a crouched, hunchback trot, is jarring, to say the least. I am reminded of nothing so much as the stooping goblins of EverQuest.  This roughness carries over to the heart of any baseball game, the battle between pitcher and batter. The batter stands way the heck off the plate yet somehow still managing to hit the ball even though it looks like his bat doesn't even connect. But if he doesn't make contact, it looks like he's check swinging, even if you took a big cut.  This confusion over where your bat is going exacerbates what is a pretty rudimentary pitcher/batter interface. Without any kind of pitch landing target (showing you where the ball might be going) or even a box to mark the strike zone, you're forced to rely solely on your eye to guess where the ball's going--not easy when the ball is a jerky white sprite. Furthermore, the breakdown of balls to strikes is oriented towards arcade-style gameplay, and I defy you to regularly work out a walk in this game, or get the AI batters to consistently swing at balls out of the strike zone. In order to strike someone out you have to throw in the strike zone and roll the dice as to whether or not the player is going to hit it. This defeats the whole purpose of pitching.  Management options are equally mediocre, since there's no career mode, no fantasy draft, and no trading AI at all. This leaves you with pretty much only two ways to play--exhibition games and a single season mode. Yawn.  The game does have some good touches, including automated defensive shifts, which is a good thing, since accessing the defensive controls requires using the mouse and the keyboard--a major distraction when you're trying to play the game with a gamepad, which is how I like to play. Why oh why can't the PC game makers take a cue from the console designers in this--keep all the in-game options accessible via the one controller you're going to use to play the game with? Mouses are better than gamepads for the menus in between the games, but once you're on the field, keep all the info a button press away.  But all in all, I can't think of a single reason why you should get this game. If you want a purely arcade game of baseball that doesn't take itself too seriously, Triple Play is a good choice. If you want more a more realistic, deep baseball game, both on and off the field, you're better off with High Heat 2000. And if for some reason you want a pretty good game of baseball that's deeper than Triple Play but you simply can't stand High Heat, then get Microsoft Baseball.   --Jason Bates", "date": "May 8, 1999"}
