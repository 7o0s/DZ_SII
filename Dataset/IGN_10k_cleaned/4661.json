Good to know this skewed version of America is out there, our image distorted through the show's large breasted prism. However, that global visibility means developing a game based on the show is a safe bet, so Blue Beck steps up with an appropriate beach volleyball game.   Features:   Based on the TV show  Beach volleyball   What's not appropriate, though, is how awful the game is. For a mobile gamer, Baywatch Beach Volleyball is absolute kryptonite -- a licensed game on par with Fury of the Hulk and Looney Tunes Zany Race. Why Verizon ever let this on its deck is beyond us -- it's games like this that can ruin the incredible momentum of wireless gaming. If this was our first download, we'd be tempted to never buy another game on our cellphone either.   Why so bad? Everything screams budget. Actually, screaming would involve effort on the game's part, so we'll settle for whimper. The opening screen is just bland -- the title on blue with options below. We thought maybe we'd at least look at the controls before playing, but instead, all we got was a scrolling mesh of words, blurring as they scrolled by. Look, if you cannot get a decent scrolling refresh rate, go for static screens.   Once in Baywatch Beach Volleyball, we were treated to some of the worst volleyball this side of the Atari 2600. The screen is too small to encompass the entire court, so it must scroll back and forth, following the ball. That wouldn't be a problem if the ball actually moved quickly, and our out-of-sight players responded to the controls in a timely manner. Returning a serve has nothing to do with skill -- it's all patience and luck, both of which ran out fast.   Baywatch Beach Volleyball promises that you can play with the famous ladies of the show. Lies. Well, technically it's a bunch of lies. We saw a quick grab of some chick before the game started, and then all you get are washed-out blurs of what appears to be a girl in a red swimsuit. She's blonde, so maybe that's Pamela Anderson. Or Lee. Or whatever.Normally, I hate to put bad reviews in the top spot because I figure that crap games hardly deserve the space. But when Verizon put Baywatch Beach Volleyball at the top of its deck this week, I felt compelled it offer up a warning for anybody tempted to download it. A beach volleyball game on your cell is not a bad idea. Maybe somebody like Sorrent or Mforma can do it right, because Blue Beck's attempt is a shameful cash-in.", "date": "Apr 21, 2004"}
