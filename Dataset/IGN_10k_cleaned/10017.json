Dragon Quest Swords: The Masked Queen and the Tower of Mirrors was originally set to be a launch game for Wii back in November of 2006, but that obviously didn't happen.  With a huge amount of releases on the system, and a pretty large amount of audio/visual localization for the English version of DQ Swords, the game was held until now.  So after nearly two years of waiting, how does the game stack up to the rest of Wii's library?  Pretty well, actually, as long as you take it for what it is: an entry-level RPG.   DQ Swords is -- in nearly every way -- a role playing game for the un-gamer.  Keeping the soul of the Dragon Quest series in tact, Square's design has been simplified to an almost ridiculous degree, making use of linear levels and Wii-mote only control.  Based on the original plug-n-play game from Japan, DQ Swords keeps the simple design, but uses the Wii's power for a more impressive audio/visual package.  Players take on the role of Blade, a young hero on a pretty generic quest to rid the world of evil, and from there upgrade their hero with some basic equipment and items, level up through battle, and gain a posse of friends and family to help thwart an evil uprising.    But if you've bee waiting for the game as long as we have, you already know this.  The real questions are, does it work, and is it fun?  To answer honestly, both of those questions deserve an overwhelming, ~sort of.~  The combat is focused on IR pointing and motion slashing, and while the concept is extremely simple, the design ends up being a sort of button masher with Wii motion swapped in.  Players can attack with vertical, horizontal, diagonal, and stabbing actions, and for the most part they translate well.  Every once in a while you'll get a bad swing, but with only the loss of a combo to fear, there's really no punishment for poor swinging.  Just select a new point on the screen, and try again.   It's absolutely essential to look at DQ Swords as a role playing game for first timers, so in that sense the simplicity is warranted.  You'll want to buy every item, use every piece of material found for upgrading, and kill everything you come in contact with. The game houses only one main city, with one weapon shop, one item shop, one armor shop, one save point, one gigantic castle, and one station for mini-games.  It's pretty funny to imagine an epic struggle between good and evil with only the lives of a dozen or so NPCs at stake, but considering the audience, Swords feels less like the ~easy way out~ as far as design goes, and more like a unique action/RPG that takes inspiration from the likes of Dragon Quest Monsters.  It's simple by design, and still fun within its own right.   Use IR to block attacks.  Just remember to repair your shield.  Although that simplicity also brings a generally passive overall feel to the game.  Aside from making a few dumb moves along the way, we never found ourselves in a pinch.  Enemies are generally easy enough to kill in a few swipes, levels are simple enough to beat in a sitting (this is, after all, a more arcade-like experience, and not a game meant to be played for hours and hours on end), and you've always got enough cash and items at your disposal.  The game is also relatively short as well for a Wii title (grossly brief for a DQ game) at a total of eight hours front to back, and while there's definite added appeal through the mini-games, mission rating system, and hard mode, we found our experience was over by the time we were ready for it to ramp up in difficulty.      Take, for example, our weapon upgrades.  During the game you'll only make use of swords, so the weapon shop does little good outside of tempering blades you've already got.  Don't expect a giant list of options here, as they don't exist.  Instead, you can take your short sword and upgrade it, do so again to add elemental power to the blade, and then continue your track of either fire, ice, or electricity to further power-up your weapon.  We were huge on the idea of picking an elemental allegiance, but in the interest of being versatile on the battlefield decided to buy and upgrade though a couple different routes.  By the time we started on our second blade tough, we were at the door of the final stage of the game.  The intention here is to of course make something accessible and easy to manage, but it's worth noting that DQ Swords is one of the thinner offerings we've seen from Square in years, and that includes pocket efforts.  Some of the bosses in the game are massive, resulting in a chance for huge combo attacks.  One thing we don't want the paint a picture of, however, is that DQ Swords is some quick-fix cop-out experience; it isn't.  Square did a great job of delivering some pretty polished (though basic) graphical work, with beautiful enemy animations and some pretty appealing level environments.  Some bosses in the game take up almost the entire screen, the battlefield is constantly filled with effects animation through the use of magic, items, and blade slashes, and the small amount of CG work in the game does a decent job of filling in the gaps in the storytelling.  About half the overall text in the game is supported with well delivered VO as well, so while you'll still get occasional sections that rely only on reading scrolling text, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the mass of voice work that is in the game.  There's also a decent nod to the classic DQ series as well, with some sound effects dating back to the very beginning of the franchise's life.   In fact, aside from the game's general simplicity, there's only one major change we would have liked to see in the design, and that's the requirement of using only the Wii-mote for all navigation and battle.  Moving around in a 3D environment with a D-pad is a chore, plain and simple, and there's a reason why Nintendo included the nunchuk adapter for Wii.  Since the entire game is done in first person, that means you're constantly navigating through worlds with control similar to the original Doom series (minus the strafe buttons), and Blade feels less like a nimble hero, and more like a gigantic tank as he rotates and slides around town.  The Wii-mote only decision was based on simplicity, but comfort is also lost along the way, as running requires you to move the d-pad while holding down the B trigger, and it's far from relaxing.  Even a simple option to enable analog control would have been nice, but it's nowhere to be found.Dragon Quest Swords isnt your average RPG experience, and as such certain gamers might be thrown off by what Square Enix has done with Wiis first outing.  If youre looking for a hardcore, 50+ hour experience, this isnt it.  What DQ Swords brings to the table, however, is an extremely accessible role playing experience that works to capture new gamers in the world of Dragon Quest.  The combat is fast and action-packed, the actual RPG elements are much lighter than anything weve seen from Square in years (maybe ever), and the storyline is simple and accessible for any age.  Even the level-building and party management is totally streamlined, as all AI is handled on the fly.  Theres a definite wish list of changes we would have liked to see though, as the Wii-mote only controls arent extremely comfortable, and the adventure is over before you know it. As a product that ends up being Dragon Quest Lite though, Swords is still pretty entertaining while it lasts.", "date": "Feb 13, 2008"}
