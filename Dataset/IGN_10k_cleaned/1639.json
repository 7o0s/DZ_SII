The game pits players as Terry McGinnis, a 17 year-old rebel who teams up with a now-aged Bruce Wayne in the 21st Century to become the next Batman. Donning his new, mechanically enhanced Bat suit, McGinnis takes to the streets of Gotham City to do battle with a wide variety of enemies from robotic menaces to the Joker himself. All of the action is of course based on the television show of the same name, and more closely still to a recent Warner Bros. video release.   Good license. Bad execution. Unfortunately for console owners, Batman Beyond for Nintendo 64 looks more like an average Super-NES title than anything else, and in fact is even more dated in terms of what it brings to the gameplay table.    The Facts  Based on the Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker home video Features Batman and other foes Batman can punch, kick, and use weapons Cartoon-style cut-scenes Final Fight-like brawl action Single-player One guitar riff   Gameplay In the cartoon series of the same name, Terry McGinnis -- Batman -- is an acrobatic superhero of the future, fully able to leap, dive and summersault his way up and across building tops, all the while using an endless supply of gadgetry on foes. In the game, this character can move left or right through a series of boring, 2D-ish environments in a style similar to Final Fight -- an aged, dead style, we might add. The game's version of Batman can also jump, punch, and kick (though he cannot execute these moves at the same time) and throw projectiles. Finally, the Dark Knight can pick up keys that unlock doors, where all of the above is repeated again and again until the player either goes insane or falls asleep.  It's actually much more interesting to detail what Batman Beyond does not feature than what it does. There is no real fight system. Rather, Batman can execute a series of punches and kicks that ~developer~ Kemco calls combos. There is no point in using the gadgetry. Batman's stupid punches and kicks are more powerful than any weapons he may have, and therefore the most important aspect of the game if a player wants to bother his or herself with advancing. There is no variation. Room after bland room awaits our superhero, with poorly realized foes and no artificial intelligence to be found. There is, simply, no real reason to own this sorry product. Still not convinced to stay away? Let's move onto graphics then, shall we?  Graphics What Batman Beyond spits up in gameplay mechanics it really makes a sloppy, diarrhea mess out of in visuals. It's as if ~developer~ Kemco took a good, hard look at Superman 64 and said, ~You know. I think we've got a good chance of competing.~ In the title, which incidentally makes Crave Entertainment's Fighting Force 64 look spectacular by comparison, Batman is barely animated, the backgrounds have zero detail, the environments are fairly naked, the enemies look laughable, and the layout only faintly resembles something 3D. This is not Batman Beyond -- it's Batman Behind.  Sound The presentation of Kemco's Batman Beyond is as poor as everything else about the game, and that includes the sound. There is no speech to be found -- none. Any story developments come via text, and in our playing there seems to be only one guitar riff. The same music repeating over and over, over and over, over and over, and over and over and over, and over and over some more! No! No! Please -- make it stop. Standard sound effects for punches and the occasional ~boom~ as something explodes are the only interruption from the never-ending, looping riff. Batman Be Gone would have been a more fitting title for this insultingly poor ~3D~ brawler. Everything about the product is shoddily executed, from its formulaic and outdated gameplay mechanics to its horribly dusty graphic look. There are no options, enemies are downright stupid, the backgrounds are repetitive and uninteresting, and the sound offerings are unacceptable at best. Do not buy this game.
