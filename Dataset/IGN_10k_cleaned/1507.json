Retail shelves, already set to overflowing with titles held back over the long summer, are crammed anew with products shoved out to meet year-end sales goals. For game publishers it is of paramount importance to put only the best and the brightest products into the holiday channel if they harbor any hopes of grabbing the attention of consumers besieged by shotgun marketing approaches. A game must truly stand out and provide an unparalleled experience in the face of such competition. Simon & Schuster Interactive, late of Panty Raider, is hardly renowned for delivering work of such caliber. To wit, Amazons & Aliens, a real-time strategy import from JoWood productions of Germany. Who? Exactly.   Amazons & Aliens is set in a far-off world that is best described as a tragic blend of classic Warcraft and Saturday morning Smurfs. Three disparate races -- the Pimmons (Aliens), the Sajiki (Bugs) and the Amazons (Humans) -- vie for world domination on the planet Lukkat. Gameplay is standard 4X: eXplore, eXploit, eXpand and eXterminate.  Technology tree? Absolutely. Trade and diplomacy? Roger. Upgradeable units? Why not. It is as though the developers went down a menu of features culled from every strategy title spanning the last five years and checked off whatever sounded good. Unfortunately, ham-handed implementation and lackluster production values obscure what few clever devices are buried within.  First impressions suggest the developers had intentions of creating a game that, while by no means profound, was at least competent. Interesting concepts such as incorporating the mouse wheel to smoothly zoom in and out of the map or re-training existing units with new occupations raised hopes that a thoughtful game might lie beneath. However, such hopes were dashed early and often.   Amazons & Aliens offers three modes of play: campaign, open-ended, and multiplayer. Each of the three races offers a distinct campaign consisting of 20 objective-oriented scenarios, which must be played in order. The open-ended ~Never Ending Game~ mode is as the name suggests. Multiplayer is either IPX or TCP/IP, though no affiliation is made to any of the current online matching services. An option menu allows for multiple resolutions, auto-save feature, EAX audio and support for 3D accelerators. Also present, a handful of generally concise tutorials that introduce the basic mechanics of construction, research, trade and combat in a classic mouse-driven interface. During gameplay a toolbar located along the right of the screen provides all necessary information and control in fairly succinct fashion, though the icons are very tiny even at the default resolution.   Enter the Pimmons. A race of... well, its not entirely clear what the Pimmons are, besides blue. Their basic unit is named, imaginatively enough, a Transporter. Transporters are versatile creatures, initially useful for gathering food and moving raw materials to and from farms, construction sites and the town hall. Upon construction of a school a transporter may be retrained with a different occupation. Consequently, units are never wasted and may be recycled into miners, soldiers, diplomats or whatever the conditions might dictate. Constructing a laboratory allows new technologies to be researched, further facilitating new buildings and unit types. As new technologies are discovered their corresponding building type is enabled and its requisite unit opens up at the school, where up to five may be queued at a time. All units and buildings are presented as rendered sprites using a rich color palette. Amazons & Aliens is nothing if not bright and cheery.   Not too bad so far, right? Watch as cracks begin to form in the foundation. Transporters will intelligently come to the aid or a master builder bearing rock or wood as needed, but will stand right next to a berry-laden plant while everyone in the village starves. Queue a lumberjack at the school and the nearest idle transporter will make a beeline for the door. Upon completion of study the lumberjack just stands dimly outside, regardless if a thatch of trees are dumping apples by the bushel right on his head. Every unit in the game exhibits this same tendency, resulting in a mad dash to constantly evaluate every single unit in the game at every possible instant. To make matters worse, there is no hotkey or toolbar option for locating idle units. Neither is there a ~Next Unit~ key. Therefore units standing behind a building or in the midst of a forest might just as well be dead.  Selecting individual units can be touch and go, as rapid mouse clicking can clog the game engine, resulting in no action being registered at all. Units seem to move at half-speed, which is something of an oxymoron since there is only one non-adjustable speed in the game. A matter exacerbated by the excruciating design of many of the campaign scenarios. Case in point, Amazon scenario #2. Provided two scouts, two miners, four transporters, a lumberjack, and a master builder find the magic tree and bring back three wood to the town hall. Since there are no trees in the scenario and there are no preexisting stores, the builder is useless. After a good 20 minutes the scouts happen upon the tree, which is ringed by giant rocks. Sending the miners in to remove the rocks takes more than an hour, since each miner can carry but a single chunk at a time and each rock has about 15 chunks to it. As the town hall is on the other side of the map and everyone moves as though treading pond water the obvious choice would be to relocate the town hall, but as the story goes, no such option exists.   The developers of Amazons & Aliens have gone to extraordinary lengths to deliver a gaming experience that is remarkably generic and utterly devoid of personality. The manual, if a 23-page CD insert may be called that, fails to impart anything of substance or color about the races, never mind their respective strengths and weaknesses. Technology, Unit and building types are virtually identical across the races, though some of the names are distinct. There are no clever sound bytes associated with selecting a unit or building, as might be expected. Sound effects are slim to none overall. The background music is but a single, grating New Age track. Graphically each race bears some personality, but the animation is so short on key frames that the world comes across stilted and halting.   It is clear that JoWood wished to create a gaming experience exhibiting the spirit and humor of Bullfrog's quirky titles, though most of their attempts fall flat. Perhaps something was lost during localization, but what exactly is funny about Mushroom juice and Maggot lollipops?   To be fair, games such as Alpha Centauri, StarCraft and Roller Coaster Tycoon have raised consumer expectations far too high for small development houses to compete on equal footing. Harsh, but the bottom line is simply that there is zero room for mediocrity. With a good dozen or more RTS titles debuting over the next twelve months the genre is crammed tight. The result is that almost by default an RTS should provide intelligent and autonomous units, a rich storyline and strong characterizations. Amazons & Aliens attempts to make soup out of ideas such as these, but somehow tosses out any shred of originality in the process, ending up with something that is altogether unpalatable.  -- David Kozlowski      Want to share your opinions with the world?
