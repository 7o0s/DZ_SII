Reaxion is banking on sweet nostalgia with their new moto-stunt game Evel Knievel Evel-ution, which recreates five of Evel's biggest jumps.   Evel Knievel Evel-ution takes place in three locales: Las Vegas, Ontario, and King's Island. The game maps out Evel's career, starting with his failed attempt to jump a fountain in Vegas, circa-1968. Before each jump, players get a little history on each event, not unlike the pre-event text found in Pax Athletica. Once you've been properly educated, it's off to the races -- so to speak.   The game uses incredibly easy controls. You accelerate with ~6~ and brake with ~4.~ Before you launch your bike over the main jump, you must pop wheelies for the crowd and lurch across smaller jumps. In the air -- or durring a wheelie sequence, you use ~4~ and ~6~ to maintain balance. Simple controls -- but getting the hang of this digital balancing act is anything but.   You will crash. Often. You must be very particular when throwing yourself across jumps. Hit it too fast and maintaining balance is near-impossible. And then there's the mater of landing. You cannot stab your front wheel into the dirt or you'll end up with your teeth in the handlebars. Land too far on your rear tire and you're on yer keister. You have to hit with both wheels -- or as close as possible -- and the simple controls are almost too clumsy to do so with any great frequency.   Evel Knievel Evel-ution isn't a terribly deep game -- and they all don't have to me, you know -- but it at least needs to be fun. And repeatedly biffing it into the dirt just isn't. Making it to the main jump in your given time limit (the clock is always ticking, and crashes shave off precious seconds) is pretty rare not only because of the challenge, but because you'll likely lose interest.   The game doesn't look too shabby. We played it on an LG VX7000 and enjoyed the bright visuals and eye-popping color. Each track has a unique look with little clever touches, such as crowd members holding up signs. The game opens with a small jungle, but then settle in for slight in-game effects.Evel Knievel Evel-ution just isn't a very compelling play. It's too shallow with too frustrating control. Even hardcore Evel fans -- and I know they are still legion -- might be turned-off by how touchy the jump mechanics are and how often they wind up in the dirt. Sure, Evel had his share of crashes, but at least he got paid when he ate it.", "date": "Dec 7, 2004"}
