{"name": "Street Fighter III: Double Impact", "name_review": "Street Fighter III: Double Impact", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/24/street-fighter-iii-double-impact", "text": "Back in the good ol' days of gaming (I'm referring to those glorious years involving Genesis in its prime and SNES in its infancy), Street Fighter was the Resident Evil of games.  Here was a series that could give birth to thousands of clones, turn arcades into hangout stops for countless highschool punks, sell a million $200 consoles, and, when it wielded its great rage, push a company to the near brink of extinction.  Such was the power of Street Fighter, and specifically Street Fighter II - this is a series which will be forever recorded into written history as ~one of the greatest things ever.~ Street Fighter III doesn't have that same power.  Don't get me wrong - it's a wonderful game.  But the Resident Evil of games?  We'll leave that distinction to Resident Evil itself.  SF3's three separate arcade debuts (for its three different incarnations) were quiet at best, with more gamers (if that's what they are) preferring Namco's Tekken 3.  This game is not going to push a million Dreamcast systems on the public - not by a long shot.   Sure, it's strange, as the mere mention of a third entry in the Street Fighter series would have caused an uproar in those simple times, but now the actual home release of a Street Fighter III is something less than an event.  That's unfortunate, though, as Street Fighter III: Double Impact is one of the best fighters around, and a refreshing alternative to the sheer madness of Marvel vs Capcom 2. Street Fighter III takes the series back to its original form, where skill ruled over flash.  Forget about aerial raves, custom combos, and massive screen splitting effects.  This is a game that gives you a few standard moves along with a super move or two and forces you to work with these elements to build your skill level.  And it feels like a fighting system that has been refined over years of tweaking - that's what it is, afterall.  Want super move after super move after super move non stop?  Look elsewhere!  The game even lacks some of the features found in the wonderfully simple Alpha III - it's sorta like Alpha III in X-ism mode entirely, actually.  Among the things you won't find is air blocking, which has been replaced with a parry system that, while difficult to master, can be worked on through an included bonus game involving a basketball.  You'll also find a simpler special move system.  Referred to as Super Arts, each character has three such moves, and you can access one, and only one, when selecting your character.  No custom combos, no nothing - just pure, plain fighting.  And if you don't like it, in the immortal words of Seaman, ~you suck.~  There is only one major thing from Alpha III that you'll find included here: a special move system with varying damage based on the number of button presses.   With the game going back to its roots, it's surprising to see a whole new cast of characters this time around.  Perhaps this is why the game never took off except for amongst the hardcore, but other than Ryu, Ken and Akuma, everyone is new.  Sean, Yun, Yang, Alex, Ibuki, Elena, Dudley, Oro, Necro, Hugo, Urien and Gill... these twelve newbies may not be as memorable as the original characters, but they're all nicely designed and feature their own stories.  Actually, by putting your thinking caps on, you'll find some definite parallels to the original crew.  And on top of that, all the moves are pulled off in basically the same fashion - you could read a move list consisting primarily of commands listed as : ~Fireball,~ or ~Sonic Boom.~  So, Street Fighter III: Double Impact is really just a toned down Street Fighter Alpha.  Has Capcom broken the unwritten rule that a sequel must be bigger and louder than before?  In terms of gameplay, perhaps, but certainly not in the graphics sense.  Street Fighter III in the arcades made use of Capcom's rarely seen CPS-III arcade board, which allowed for an incredible level of animation, with character clothing flowing all over the place - it blows away any other 2D animation out there, by far.  The Dreamcast version seems to replicate all the animation perfectly, and does so with zero load time, a feature that served to impress me as much as when I first set hands on the Saturn version of X-Men versus Street Fighter.  This isn't the be-all and end-all of 2D graphics, though.  The characters are still less than 640x480, and the backgrounds show no improvement over other 2D fighters, certainly not at the level of Marvel vs Capcom 2.  Full 2D glory will have to wait for Guilty Gear X.  But people aren't going to be playing this game for graphics, that's for sure.  Some of us have gotten tired of all the craziness of other Capcom fighters, and need an occasional title like this or Alpha III to take us back to what it's all about.  So the question arises - which should you get, Street Fighter III, or Alpha III?  Alpha III has a larger cast of fighters, including all your old favorites, more modes of play, including the awesome World Tour Mode in which you build up characters, and some cool 3-player options.  Street Fighter III features a limited training mode, a versus CPU mode (you need to fiddle around with the options screen to get this to work), and a blocking mini game mode.  That's it, though.  The game does include both the first and second versions of Street Fighter III, but the first version's inclusion is pure novelty, as there's not much need for it.  Alpha III wins hands down in all senses.  If you've tried out Alpha III, though, or you want to take a stab at some little known Capcom newbie fighters, or you'd like to pretend for a moment that the games industry were as baggage-free as it was back in 1992, then this is your game.  -- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDC", "date": "Jun 24, 2000"}
