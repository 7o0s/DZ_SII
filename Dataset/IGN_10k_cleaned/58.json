The past few months have seen the release of such huge and time consuming games as Hidden & Dangerous, Starfleet Command, and Jagged Alliance 2.  Well now we have Darkstone ... great!  What an addictive little time-stealer this is.  The Diablo-esque action/RPG has kept me busy since its release, and I'm still playing it constantly. I just can't put it down and I'm already going into withdrawal having to take time out of my busy playing schedule to write this review, so forgive me if there are some mispled wirds in hear ... I hav the shakes real bad.  As I'm sure you already know from reading previews about this game, Darkstone plays very similarly to Diablo ... ok, it's just like Diablo.  Darkstone doesn't pretend to be anything else.  You explore dungeons from an isometric view, hacking, zapping, or shooting everything that dares to cross your path.  There are some levers to pull and a few traps to avoid, but overall this is very watered down dungeon delving that's all about hackin' 'n' slashin'.  Not that this is a bad thing (as a matter of fact, it's a helluva lot of fun), but it's certainly not on the level of some of the more advanced RPGs like the Wizardry and Might & Magic series.   You seek your fortune in a variety of different locations that you would expect in any fantasy setting: castles, dungeons, plague-ridden cities, and the like.  While the focus of the game is combat, there are a plethora of chests, sarcophagi, and other containers scattered around each dungeon to bust open that will satisfy your treasure-tooth while you're not busting heads.  Again, just like Diablo, but is that so wrong?    There are a few areas where Darkstone outshines Diablo.  For starters, the view angle is much more manageable than Diablo's, and it helps that you can switch from an isometric perspective to a directly overhead view, giving you a better overall picture of the area you're exploring.  The game also has a fully adjustable camera that's actually really easy to control on the fly, even in the heat of battle.  This allows you to examine every location from a variety of angles and target the incoming hordes of enemies.   Unlike Diablo, you can control two characters at once instead of just a single adventurer, although you can opt to play the entire game with only one for more of a challenge.  You create your two-person party from one of four basic classes: Warrior, Monk, Assassin, and Wizard, with female equivalents of each (Amazon, Priestess, Sorceress, and Thief).  This dual-character setup is great because it really gives you variety of ways to play the game.  As you would expect, warriors are buff and tough, assassins are silent but deadly (like Vincent after his bean lunches), monks are good for healing, and wizards are the most adept at slinging offensive spells.  Although each class has its specialty, nearly everyone can learn the basic skills or each class given practice and money.  Sure, a thief won't be as good at casting spells or have the variety of incantations that a wizard has to choose from, but they can learn a few of the more rudimentary conjurations.  Darkstone also has a lot more options than Diablo.  There are 32 different spells, 22 skills, 22 types of weapons, and 37 levels to explore, so Darkstone really offers a lot of variety to gamers.  As if this weren't enough, the game creates an entirely random map and adventure for each new game, complete with new missions, new items, and new dungeon placement. While your ultimate goal in each game is to recover the seven shards of the Time Orb to defeat the evil monk Draak, there are dozens of new quests that you can complete in each game that keeps the action fun and lively.  This makes Darkstone one of the most repayable titles ever.  I really liked the look and feel of the game, too. The slick, simple interface makes Darkstone one of the easiest and most intuitive games I've gotten my hands on in months.  There's no need to learn any a long list of commands, and if you've ever played Diablo you can just burn the manual when you get home because you already know how to play this game.  Graphically, the game is very sharp and colorful.  It's almost as if you're playing a fantasy-based cartoon. Although level design is somewhat sparse, everything is well defined and pleasant to look at.  All of the characters in the game are rendered using 3D polygons, allowing each character a full range of movements and animations.  And your character's appearance will even change based on the items you have equipped.  You will need a 3D accelerator to play the game but, if you don't have one yet, this may be the game that warrants an upgrade.   Like the graphics, the sound in Darkstone is extremely well produced. Voice-overs are clean and crisp, and surprisingly well acted.  While some of the voices are a bit goofy, this just fits in with the cartoony feel of the game, and never detracts from the game's plot.  The soundtrack fits in with the mood of the game perfectly, with the exception of the Darkstone theme song that the bards play if you give them some spare change.  This light pop ditty would be right at home on the local light rock station, sandwiched between Kenny G and John Tesh.  And where in the hell did those bards get an electric bass and a full drum set ... and how did they get all of those sounds out of one mandolin.  Amazing!  The multiplay option in Darkstone is extremely entertaining as well.  There's only one basic game type to play, but it's fun and can be played in a variety of different ways.  You only control one character in the multiplayer game, but everyone's goal is the same: re-create the Time Orb and overthrow the evil Draak, just like in the single player game.  Although it's easy to set up a game and the multiplay was very stable, it's not real easy to find a game as there is no in-game utility, so you have to know the IP address of the person who's hosting the server.  When you do find one, though, all of the time you spent searching is well worth it.  Gameplay mechanics are exactly the same as in the single player game, except you can choose to go solo or ally with others in the game.  As a solo adventurer, you can hurt or be hurt by everyone in the game and, as an ally, you can neither harm or be harmed by your other allies.  There are even some multiplayer specific skills, like the language skill that can be used to decipher decoded messages.  In the end, Darkstone is an incredibly fun and addictive game that's easy enough for almost anyone to pick up.  While the concept behind Darkstone isn't very original, we can honestly say that it's the best Diablo-esque game we've played since, well, Diablo.  Darkstone comes highly recommended, and is destined to be a classic.  -- Tal Blevins Darkstone is ten bucks, and there's an awful lot of game here -- it's a far better deal than something like the shallow Ball Breakers or the unplayable Spec Ops.  Anybody who liked Diablo or anything else in the realm of dungeon-hack RPGs should be able to get their pocket-change's worth out of it.  Fans of traditional console RPGs are warned that they'll probably detest the presentation and near-lack of story, though.But even if ten bucks is cheap, free is even better, and Nethack is free for darn near every operating system ever devised by man -- as are Hack, Rogue, Adom, Omega, Moria, Angband, and God knows how many other ASCII roguelike games.  Give one of those a shot too, why don't you?  They may look simple, but you never have to worry about accidentally setting off the bard.", "date": "Aug 14, 1999"}
