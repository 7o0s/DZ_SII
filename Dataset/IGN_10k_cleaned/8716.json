Improbable stunts. One-liners. The formula for the ~Die Hard~ movies is pretty much chiseled in stone, like a ten commandments for action filmmaking. Gameloft collects all of these necessary ingredients for their mobile game based on the fourth ~Die Hard~ flick, ~Live Free or Die Hard,~ unsurprisingly placing them in the successful-but-familiar framework of past hits, like Splinter Cell and Mission: Impossible III. The resulting game will feel like a mildly enjoyable bit of deja vu for mobile gamers that have jammed on Gameloft's side-scrolling actioners for the last two years, but newcomers that are wading into mobile for the first time should be pleasantly surprised at Detective John McClane's itty-bitty antics.   Live Free or Die Hard stars John McClane (without actor likeness rights, the hero is only Bruce Willis-esque) as a detective out to stop a genius hacker and save his daughter. He has enlisted the help of another computer geek, a wimpy brainiac that has the mental toolset for stopping the villainous hacker from bringing down America's digital infrastructure. McClane is more of a hands-on kinda guy, so he uses his fists, guns, and wisecracks to get his half of the job done.   The majority of the game is a side-scrolling action game not entirely unlike the movie-games of the 16-bit era -- but with better focus. You must fight your way through stage after stage of hired guns determined to stop McClane from reaching the boss. Clane has a series of hot moves, like dropping over railing to stomp enemies from above or rolling through tunnels to surprise bad guys before below. Using only the 5 button, you can either unload a clip into enemies from a distance or run up for some close-quarters combat that features nice animation work.   After killing a certain number of bad guys, McClane loses his cool. This ~rage mode,~ set off by pressing 0 when his anger meter is full, turns McClane into a one-man army. He slo-mo jumps back with gun a-blazin', only to finish off all on-screen enemies with a bazooka he pulls out of nowhere. (I shudder to think of where he hides it.) The rage attack is a nice flourish, but McClane's regular attacks are usually good enough that I would occasionally finish a stage without ever needing it.   The driving sequences are pretty cool, as you steer a cop car and truck around Washington DC, avoiding traffic and shooting obstacles before you accidentally collide with them. These frantic chases through the city and into tunnels are straight out of the movie. For example, as seen in the trailer, you must run the car through a tunnel -- avoiding damage so you can launch it into the air and ~kill a helicopter,~ as seen in the trailer. The driving controls can prove a little confusing at first, as you steer with all of the number keys, save for 5. But the orientation of the control change as your vehicle changes direction -- in one early sequence, you box several blocks and must constantly re-think the directionality of the controls.   Finally, there are some puzzle mini-games that have more to do with the hacking part of the story. You must diffuse bombs by clipping numbered wires or redirect lasers through a system of mirrors.   Gameloft has ~cool~ action down very well. The way McClane can kick pressurized gas canisters into enemies and fill the screen with flames or reach up and throw a bad guy off a ledge just looks very slick. There's no doubt that Gameloft is the best developer in mobile for making cinematic animations and scenes that invoke a smile from the player. They know how to set a scene, too, such as the walk through the darkened facility where you can only see as far as the tip of your nose while hunting enemies. Live Free or Die Hard looks exceptional from one end to the other.   My big complaint about Live Free or Die Hard is that it reminded me so much of last summer's very cool Mission: Impossible III that I wondered just how much of the development cycle was spent replacing assets. You know, swapping out tiny Ethan Hunt for tiny John McClane. I mentioned earlier that a newcomer won't notice any of this, but if you've been relying on Gameloft for side-scrolling action for some time (and you should have been), you'll really start seeing the same cogs and levers that make up the machinery that powers this formula. At least I never saw McClane wall-run...  Live Free or Die Hard is a solid action game with some pretty cool moments, such as the first time you see McClane uppercut a punk or hurl a Molotov over a ruined old baby grand. But I've played this game before -- many times -- and it's losing its luster for me. While I will always be impressed by Gameloft's attention to detail and ability to fashion some exciting scenes, I'm suffering from fatigue, especially coming so soon after Pirates of the Seven Seas. These action games are starting to blur together -- and after yesterday's review of Sony's excellent God of War, it's hard to get too enthusiastic about a re-heated formula.", "date": "Jun 28, 2007"}
