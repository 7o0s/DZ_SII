Well, it seems that there's still an insane dictator running the show now. He and his FMEN (the Federation of Militant Equal Nationalists, if you can believe that) are causing all sorts of trouble now and it's up to you to stop it. You've been commissioned into the new UN Peacekeeping mission to eliminate this evil, crazy group. They chose you because of your superior tank piloting and gunnery skills. Now you're in the driver's seat of the new M12 tank as you run about the desert blowing up enemy tanks in glorious 3D.  So this M12 thing, nicknamed the Hammer, is supposedly the most advanced weapons platform in the ~free world.~ I assume that that also makes the most advanced weapons platform in all the world. You know the oppressed peoples of the world don't have too much of an edge in technology or manufacture...well, maybe the Taiwanese. Anyway, this thing is fast, tough and packs a huge punch. In fact, it's so far above the competition that you'll run into, that the game winds up being very little challenge at all.  The main weapon of the Hammer is the Chaingun. It has unlimited ammo, but doesn't do much damage. To supplement the Chaingun, you'll start each mission with four types of missiles. The HEAT is the mainstay of your missile offense. It has a great range and does a fair amount of damage. Best of all you get a ton of them to start. SABOT missiles are also good against enemy tanks. They're a little stronger but you start with fewer of them. The big problem of these missiles is that they are totally unguided. If you're at all inaccurate, you'd do better to trust the ATGMs (Anti-Tank Guided Missiles). These home in on...well, you know what guided means, right? For aerial dangers (read: Helicopters), you'll need to use the AAGM (Anti-Air Ground Missile). Although the manual says these are ~worthless~ against ground targets, I found them quite effective. See if the Iraqi tank commanders think they're ~worthless.~ Honestly, the missiles all seem pretty much the same to me.  But that's not all! Invade before midnight and you'll also get strike support in the form of artillery or air power. You get five of these at the start of each mission. Against enemy units, you will call in fighter-bombers and choppers. Just select a target, call in the strike and, if you can stand to wait around for a few seconds, you can watch the air cav roll in with some heavy-duty firepower. The problem with these is that they only attack small areas. For more wide-spread carnage use your FAM or MLRS strikes. These are only good against non-moving targets but they take out anything else in the surrounding area. The FAM and MLRS strikes are also the only strikes available in the multiplayer game. What's the deal? In the multiplayer game, moving targets are all you'll ever want to hit. Why you can't use bombers or choppers I'll never understand.  But it's not all about offense is it? Well, mostly. But there's also armor on this baby. When your armor reaches zero, you're dead. All you can do is start over. But fret not, little prince. There's a way to build up this armor again once it's depleted. An Operational Armor Stabilization and Integration System, or OASIS to those of you who don't feel like wasting your breath, is located on each map. The best strategy is to find this first. You can worry about the mission objectives later. Once you've secured the area, you can use the OASIS as a mobile base from which to destroy all the other bad guys on the map. The OASIS gradually rebuilds your armor when you're positioned over it. Since the OASIS has such a high heat signature, it's always located in a lake.  There are also three power ups that you can find in the game. These are almost always hidden in buildings. The health power up completely regenerates your M12's armor. There's also a power up that restocks your entire missile supply and one that gives you an extra strike. Sadly, the power ups are plentiful enough that ammo management and conservation isn't an issue. Just keep blasting and you'll eventually run across some more missiles.  The tank is steered with the arrow keys while the mouse is used to aim the turret. That's the way I play it at least. The default mode doesn't allow for independent turret movement, but this was far too limiting for me. You select which of your four missiles are active and ready for firing with a simple keystroke, but this option in my game was a little unstable. The missiles just kept constantly cycling back and forth. This wasn't a big deal as there really doesn't seem to be much to choose from between missile types, despite what the manual says.  The HUD in the game is pretty basic. It shows ammunition and armor levels. That's important. There's also a small radar screen in the upper corner of the HUD. This'll show you all sorts of important hinkfo. First and most importantly, you'll be able to see nearby enemies. These are divided into two categories--those that can shoot and those that can't. The distinction is actually quite useful as you won't be wasting your time blowing up buildings while enemy tanks are shooting at you. The radar also shows mission objectives and the location of the OASIS on each map. There's also a big, whole map version of the radar that allows you to view the whole battlefield. As an added bonus, there's no fog of war here. If an enemy's not on your map, he don't exist.  The game campaign is composed of 18 missions, each of which is very short. Worse still, they're all the same--just kill everything in sight. There's one escort mission and one defend structures from the enemy, but it's still basically a kill fest from start to finish. On two of the levels you'll have to face a ~boss~ that will present a serious challenge for you, but with a little forethought, you'll make short work of both of these guys. I finished the campaign in a little less than two hours. All that's left after that is to try it again on a harder difficulty level or, for those of you with friends, try out the multiplayer option.  The multiplayer game is a simple deathmatch. You and up to 7 other players can compete over a LAN or internet connection, but only two people can play over a modem or serial connection. In each multiplay game, you select the map and a time and kill limit. Once the time or kill limit is reached, the game is over. We occasionally found that the game would end for no particular reason whatsoever. Also the other tank turrets are a little unstable. The turrets of the other players just seem to spin around when they're firing. Worst of all, the multiplayer game is more than a little dull.  So, as if you haven't guessed already, this game is definitely in the running for coaster of the month here at IGNPC. Fundamentals of play are bad enough, but the lack of anything original (or even interesting in a derivative sort of way) make this game almost no fun at all. Within a few minutes of playing it, you will have exhausted all its options. I was tempted to give up after the first few missions, but I saw it all the way through. Even though it should only take you an hour or two to get through the whole thing, you still won't feel like you've accomplished anything.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Aug 25, 1999"}
