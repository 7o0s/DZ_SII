This, despite the fact that games like SOCOM for PlayStation 2 continue to tear through the sales charts. Gotham Games, though, has at least filled part of the gap with the release of Conflict: Desert Storm, a squad-based action shooter, for Nintendo's console. Yes, it's a port of an already-released PS2 title and sure, Xbox owners got it last year too. But Cubists can at least take pride in knowing that the title arrives with a host of improvements over its predecessor and that it delivers a good amount of fun and satisfaction, even if portions of its play mechanics and visual presentation are substandard.   The Facts  Squad-based action and stealth featuring four easy-to-control soldiers Expansive, realistic environments with smoke, heat haze, and shadows Seamless movement between indoor and outdoor environments Interact with humvees, tanks and other vehicles Experience system allows soldiers to improve from mission to mission Artificial Intelligence governs enemy actions and fellow team members Realistic tactical action designed by former SAS officer Dynamic, interactive music and battle sound effects   Gameplay The Pivotal Games-developed Conflict: Desert Storm for GameCube travels players to the Middle East in 1990 just as the unofficial war between the US and Iraq is about to break out. The entire game takes place in sandy deserts and broken down, war-ridden cities of the region. Gamers control both individual soldiers and four-person squads of Special Forces operatives -- usually the latter, and sweep through the locales while completing different objectives, from rescuing prisoners and safely exporting political figures to demolishing bridges and killing enemies. It's war. It's hell. But as far as videogames go, this is pretty fun stuff.  Desert Storm seems to have it all, from a training mode where military instructors choke out commands in hoarse, growling voices like something ripped right out of Full Metal Jacket to a variety of squad-centric missions filled with destructible objects, menacing enemies and a full arsenal of explosive weapons. There's even a cooperative mode of player for up to four gamers, which is phenomenal, but we'll get to that later.  Control mechanics are solid. The primary soldier can be strafed around with the analog stick while the camera stick is used to turn and aim. It's kind of like a setup for a first-person shooter and it's very precise, a plus. Meanwhile, L button switches between third- and first-person mode, R shoots, X selects weapons and items A reloads guns and picks up items and B crouches. It's not the most inventive configuration ever created, but it makes good use of the GCN controller and for the most part feels intuitive. Arming different weapons and items with the X button can be cumbersome, especially in the middle of a big battle, but once one gets used to the process it's manageable. Different weapons, finally, are equally satisfying. Shooting the sniper rifle, for instance, is doubly tough because the wind blows the gun around and it's difficult to aim -- a level of realism that's indicative of other parts of the title.  The game itself isn't as straightforward as some might think. One can't simply run into an environment with guns blasting, no worry of ammunition running out or dying, and blow up or bloody everything in sight. The game has several layers of strategy to consider. The focal point of play is the four-person squad setup. Gamers control their own character at all times, but they must simultaneously set commands for their three supporting computer team members. Commands can be a simple as calling team members to follow behind or as precise as instructing a single operative to perform a necessary task. It's all executed via the Z-button and a combination of buttons and what it lacks in intuitiveness it makes up for in ability. Directing a small squad of soldiers is just plain fun and players will likely feel a greater sense of accomplishment having successfully navigated all four members through a battlefield.  Conflict: Desert Storm on GameCube Desert Storm's missions are top notch, though. The title starts gamers off by themselves -- a single soldier with a formidable challenge: to rescue his kidnapped comrade, to find some C-4, to explode a bridge, and then to make off for the rendezvous site for extraction. All this while fending off groups of enemy Iraqi soldiers armed with everything from sniper rifles to small tanks. It's not easy, even on easy mode. One mustn't lose their head. A careful surveillance of each new desert cavity is helpful and so is conserving valuable commodities like medkits, which boost health, and various weapons like a rocket launcher, a gem that easily disposes of more troublesome opposition. It's fun. Additionally, there's a very lonesome, eerie feeling to running alone through the enemy-controlled locales of the Middle East, and the developer has certainly captured that in near tangible form. Meanwhile, as later missions unfold, the objectives increase in difficulty, the combat becomes more intense, and there is the added pressure of controlling one's entire group. One minor complaint is that the level of enemy AI doesn't appear to be overly difficult. Most of the Iraqi soldiers, in fact, seem fairly stupid, running carelessly straightforward into our sniper shots and rarely using objects as protection. SOCOM does it better, sure, but for GameCube owners this is so far just about as good as it gets, and frankly, it's not too shabby.    Pivotal Games has made a number of play-related enhancements to the GCN version of the title, which we've listed below:   The GCN version also has new ~Dynamic Aiming~ sights. This new crosshair system shows accuracy levels depending on the character's stance and movement, but without obstructing gameplay. There's also an upgraded auto-aim, which with a tap on the fire button raises the gun and tracks the nearest target. There's a new smooth-scrolling inventory for more efficient management of equipment, and a new shortcut system that allows the player to jump directly to key items -- like medkits -- packing in all the functionality into the GameCube's controller Feedback from the other format releases asked for a 'Restart Level' feature, which allows the player to restart from the in-game menu Enemy AI has also stepped up a gear; soldiers will hunt around for players using sound to track them, they back away from suppressing fire, and they'll remember where they last saw you The icing on the cake for the GameCube is the split screen multiplayer for 2-4 players, which lets you tackle each mission with your mates in co-op mode   The cooperative mode really is the icing on the cake. Here two-, three-, or even four-players can jump into missions and work as a team to take out the Iraqi forces. More interesting still, sometimes the missions are slightly different depending upon how many people are playing. For instance, in the first level with two players, one must traverse the desert to rescue the imprisoned other. With three players, though, all are immediately together in the wide-open desert and meant to destroy anything in their path. It's very entertaining. The downside to the mode is that the framerate, which runs decent enough with two players, takes a major hit with three or more and the action becomes noticeably more sluggish.  Graphics The visual side of Conflict: Desert Storm is filled with ups and downs. On the one hand, the locales are very ambient. Running through seemingly lifeless deserts while blasting away at snipers is well done. Neither the worlds or the characters are particularly high in polygons, but both come off solid enough regardless. There is wide variety of different level themes, all colored with beautiful sunsets and fiery cities and so much more. There are even some bump-mapped textures and some transparent smoke effects, both lovely in their own way. And to top everything off, the framerate runs better than ever in single- and two-player mode -- a facet that has been significantly improved over the PS2 version, and for that we're thankful. On the other hand, the texture work isn't of the crispest nature we've seen to date -- it's fairly low-resolution and decidedly blurry at times and because the characters are so polygon in nature there is no roundness to them, a detail that separates to the good from the great in today's games. Explosions are bigger and the screen even shakes now when players are near a blast, but the particle effects system is sub par. Gunfire, in particular, a stream of primitive yellow lines, looks poor. Lighting and proper shadow effects are also sorely missed. And the framerate chugs in major battles and in three- and four-player modes. This game does not run in progressive scan mode, either, a let down.  This isn't a bad looking game. In fact, some levels are rather impressive. But don't expect a competitor to Rogue Squadron III or Metroid Prime as far as graphics are concerned.  Sound The audio in Desert Storm is very atmospheric. From the harsh calls of the drill sergeants to the boom of the explosions, the voice work and sound effects are in top form. But it's the little extras that go a long way. The ~baa-a-a-hh-h~ of the goats that frequent the deserts; the jingle of town bells; the static of Iraqi radio; the Iraqi shouts from soldiers and Middle Eastern songs that saturate certain points -- it all comes together. Everything even runs in Dolby Pro Logic II. The only drawback here is the rather ho-hum selection of inspirational music.  Four-player cooeprative mode in action I like Conflict: Desert Storm. This is a surprisingly fun, intelligent little squad-based shooter that's made all the better on GameCube. The control mechanics feel a bit first-person shooterish, which for some reason works, and while manipulating squad members is unintuitive at first I eventually figured it out and now it's second nature. Fun level design, intriguing objectives, and a whole slew of weapons that'd make any Army nut cry in joy all come together. Some of the AI could use work, yes, and while portions of the game look good, other areas seem like something out of a Dreamcast game. But it's still enjoyable, and the cooperative mode is not to be missed.Definitely pick it up if you haven't already played it for PS2 or Xbox.", "date": "Apr 22, 2003"}
