It's latest shot at the casual crowd is Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?, which is based on the popular televised game show hosted by comedian Jeff Foxworthy. While Foxworthy is nowhere to be found in the mobile game, everything else about the show -- from selecting precocious students to category choices -- makes the transition. The result is a very playable quiz game that does something incredibly smart -- something that few other mobile quiz games do.   It doesn't tell you the correct answer when you screw up.   With just this simple design decision, 5th Grader adds at least an extra two hours of replay value. Even if a question does get recycled, you cannot cakewalk through it.   Should you shy away from the televised game show scene, 5th grade takes the basic component of other quiz shows before it -- such as Millionaire -- but add the wrinkle of using a classroom of grade school students to both help and humiliate you. Each kid has their specialties, which you actually know before going into question selection. There are like lifelines. If you bungle a question, the kid can save you once.   The trivia ranges from geography to math, from literature to music. The low value questions are easy, but as you try for the tougher questions, you'll find a few stumpers. For example, I was tripped up by a top-tier geography question asking which of four islands is the farthest south of the United States.   The production values aren't necessarily stellar; they're more on the serviceable side. The theme of the show shines, through though, such as the classic chalkboard lettering.  I am not necessarily a fan of the television show; I have only watched it once out of curios bemusement. However, check the game against online footage and the recently released PC game, I can see that the essence of the show -- sans Foxworthy -- has been captured. The questions are very good and I love that the game doesn't spoil its trivia catalog by giving up the answer after you make a mistake. If you are a fan of the show are looking for a good quiz game, you have two very good choices right now -- Gameloft's 1 vs. 100 and Capcom's Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? In fact, you may even want both.", "date": "Oct 3, 2007"}
