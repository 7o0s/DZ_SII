Those who are creepily obsessed with anthropomorphic cartoon characters and the rest of us.  If you happen to fall into the former category, Bloody Roar Extreme is likely to be your favorite game of all time.  If you fall into the latter category, it won't.   For those of you who are unfamiliar with the series, the Bloody Roar games have been around since the early days of the Playstation, where its better than average for the time fighting system and ~Beast Change~ gimmick helped the series rise above the pack of mediocre console fighters of the day.     Time passes, though, and each subsequent sequel has had a tougher time establishing itself as a top-tier fighter.  While the series does get better with each passing iteration, the improvements are in fairly small increments.  Instead of making any major improvements the basic gameplay, Hudson and Eighting seem content to just add a few new moves and characters to the mix, improve the graphics and call it a day.  As a result, every Bloody Roar game still plays an awful lot like the original.     Bloody Roar Extreme is either the third or the fifth in the series, depending on your reckoning.  You see, Extreme is a slightly enhanced port of the GameCube's Bloody Roar: Primal Fury, which is in turn a slightly enhanced port of the PS2 version of the game, Bloody Roar 3.     With an extra character over the GameCube version (3 more than the PS2 one), improved graphics and the addition of CG endings for each of the characters, Extreme is easily the best version of the game yet.  Does this mean that you should buy it?  That depends on how attracted you are to women who can turn into bats or bunny rabbits at will.   Gameplay   Anybody looking for a deep, complicated fighter along the lines of Virtua Fighter or Soul Caliber is likely to be a little bit disappointed with Bloody Roar's gameplay mechanics.   As 3D fighters go, Bloody Roar Extreme is definitely on the simple side of things.  Nowhere is this more evident than in the game's control scheme, with its whopping two attack buttons.  Here's how it works:  X punches and A kicks.  Y handles both blocking and throwing while B activates your Beast Change.  Other than using the L and R triggers to walk towards and away from the camera, that's all you get.   As you might imagine, this dearth of attack buttons means that there just aren't that many attacks per character.  Basically you've got a different kick and punch for each direction you're pressing on the d-pad, and a handful of special moves per character.  Compared to the extensive move lists found in most other modern fighters, that 's just not enough.   The only real strategy to be found in the game lies in the proper use of your Beast Change.  In order to transform into your more powerful animal self, you've got to fill up the energy bar at the bottom of the screen.  In traditional fighting game style, this is done by either doing attacks or being attacked.  Once you're able to transform, you've got to think wisely about how and when to switch.  For example, if you're almost dead, you've got to decide whether to go ahead and change or save the transformation to use in the next round.      As your beast self, you're significantly more powerful than you were, and you have access to a devastating special move.  Of course, if you use this special move, you revert back to your human self.  Is it worth the risk?  These are the kind of dilemmas that keep Bloody Roar from completely collapsing under the weight of its absolutely awful control scheme.    Another interesting aspect of Bloody Roar is the ring out system.  A wall surrounds each of the game's levels, so in order to knock somebody out you've got to first knock down parts of the wall by hitting your opponent into them.     This tends to create situations where there is one or two holes in a wall, and you and your opponent are each trying to position one another such that you'll be able to punt them out of the ring with a single swift kick.  This system goes a long way towards eliminating the ~accidental~ ring outs that can be so frustrating in other games.      Speaking of frustration, you'll be experiencing a lot of that in the game's arcade mode.  While you'll likely be able to breeze through most of the game with minimal effort, the game's final boss is one of the cheapest sacks of cheapass in the history of final bosses.  He blocks just about everything that you can throw at him, and deals a ton of damage to boot.  Grrr.     It's a good thing that there are plenty of other modes to tinker around with if you get tired of being whupped by Xion.  From the start of the game you have access to Team Battle, Vs Team Battle, Survival, Training, Arcade and Vs. modes.  If that's not enough, there are a whole slew of additional modes to be unlocked by playing through the arcade mode.  Of course, that means you'll have to fight Captain CheapBoss a awful lot.  Oh well, at least you're rewarded with a character specific movie each time you beat the game.   Graphics   Bloody Roar Extreme's graphics are, from a technical standpoint, pretty darned good.  Characters are big and fairly detailed, flashy lighting effects abound, and everything runs at a silky smooth 60 frames per second.     The character design is a bit of a mixed bag.  While all of the fighters look suitably impressive in their beast form, most of the human designs are downright lame. From the long-haired pretty boy Xion to the Strider Hiryu knockoff Bakuryu, most of these guys look like they could have been taken straight out of ~My Big Book of Anime Stereotypes.~  Yawn.    Perhaps the best word to describe the game's environments is ~adequate.~  Each level does a pretty decent job of adding atmosphere to the fighting, but you won't find much to write home about.  From the underwater aquarium to the abandoned airfield, a lot of these places will feel familiar to fans of the fighting genre.     While there's plenty of ambient effects in most of the levels, the world of Bloody Roar is strangely empty.  There's something odd about fighting in city streets in broad daylight and not seeing another human being besides the one you're fighting.  Even the subway trains that zip past you are completely empty.   Sound   If all fighting games sounded as good as Bloody Roar Extreme does, the world would be a much better place.  Well, it would sound better at least.  It's not that the game does anything particularly revolutionary; it's just that it sounds exactly like a fighting game ought to sound.     The game's sound effects all do a great job of giving the game a sense of immediacy.  From the muted thud of a furry foot impacting someone's face to the high pitched slash of a set of claws going through an opponent's chest, the attack noises are just plain satisfying.  Add in level specific noises like the splash of a body as it lands in shallow water and the assorted bells and whistles that accompany special moves, and there's pretty much always something interesting to hear.      While it likely won't appeal to everybody, I personally think that Bloody Roar's score is the cat's meow.  Composed mostly of high-energy guitar tracks with a track or two of jazz, the soundtrack is reminiscent of those great old Saturn fighting games of yore.  Ah, Fighting Vipers.  Good stuff.  Bloody Roar Extreme is a tough game to assign a score to.  On one hand, it's a moderately entertaining fighter with an interesting gimmick and enough modes to give it a good amount of replay value.  On the other hand, the game's fighting system and control scheme are in desperate need of a revamp, this is pretty much the same game I've been playing on the PS2 since 2001, and furries make me uncomfortable.What tips the scales in favor of Bloody Roar is its price.  At under $30, it's not a bad deal at all, even if you only break it out occasionally when too tired, inebriated or otherwise unable to play a more complicated game. Another factor in Bloody Roar's favor is the lack of quality fighting games for the Xbox.  While it's certainly not as good as, say, Dead or Alive 3, it's sure as heck a whole lot better than Kakuto Chojin.  If you're in the market for a new 3D fighting game and you've already played DOA3, Mortal Kombat: Dark Alliance and Tao Feng, Bloody Roar Extreme may be just the thing for you.  Just don't develop a fursuit fetish, huh?", "date": "May 27, 2003"}
