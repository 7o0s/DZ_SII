But that doesn't mean we can't expect some well done, Star Wars branded fun from LucasArts, even if the games does feature characters and storylines from the 1999 blockbuster film. With Star Wars: Obi-Wan we get a very well conceived idea for a videogame that's nearly crushed under the burden of poor execution. Many games don't even get that far, especially the ones based on popular movie franchises, so we'll give Obi Wan credit where it's due. However, you're going to have to be an absolute Phantom Menace/ Obi Wan Kenobi disciple to love and appreciate this game.   It's because every cool Jedi ability that you can pull in this game is handicapped by a sketchy camera/control scheme and graphics that are way below what the Xbox is capable of doing. Too many times you'll find yourself saying ~That's awesome~ when you force push a bunch of battle droids to their death or something like that and in the next breath cursing the game as you walk off yet another ledge.   Gameplay The appeal of Obi Wan revolves around its innovative lightsaber mechanism. Using different combinations on the right thumbstick you can swing the weapon from side to side and use overhead chops and uppercuts to slice enemies. The game forces you to read the enemy's defenses and attack their openings. So if there's a Tusken Raider holding his crowbar,er, gaffi stick over his head to block an overhead attack, you should probably just slice him in his wide open gut and move on.  And we can't forget about using The Force. To hell with what old Obi Wan and Qui Gon told us in the movies, the Jedi who uses the Force as his ally is a freaking badass. All of that penetrating and binding the galaxy together is just political rhetoric. Holding the left trigger activates your force powers and you can then slow things down in the Star Wars version of Bullet Time, yank long range weapons from enemies, jump higher force push enemies and hurl inanimate objects at enemies. Using The Force also adds new more powerful lightsaber attack moves. All of these elements, the lightsaber mechanic and The Force abilities, combine to form a very engaging and elaborate combat system, no doubt. You'll just be wishing it was featured in a game with decent control and prettier graphics.   The problems begin with the extremely loose camera system. It swings around and follows Obi Wan so that we're always seeing what he's seeing but it constantly gets hung up on objects, squashed against walls and hung up around corners. If the game had a slower pace, this might not be a problem (as we saw in Halo's vehicle missions), but Obi Wan's saber animations and movements are suited for a faster paced hack and slash type of game. The only camera controls the user has is using the white button to center the camera behind Obi Wan's head and look around and the right trigger which will target the nearest enemy and position Obi Wan and the camera accordingly. The black button flips everything 180 degrees so you can quickly engage enemies behind you. None of this helps very much however. Once you learn to keep the camera from screwing you up, you run into the next problem in Obi Wan: the level design.  We're supposed to be experiencing all of Obi Wan's adventures that George Lucas didn't show us in Episode I. After running down a few hundred empty hallways in this game you'll understand why. Even in levels that are familiar, like scene onboard the Trade Federation ship in the very beginning of Episode I, Obi-Wan manages to re-create the most boring parts of it. Apparently after Obi Wan and Qui Gon come running out of that gas filled meeting room and chop up all of those battle droids, there's 20 minutes of aimless wandering around the ship looking for the viceroy and the bridge. With only random scatterings of bad guys to deal with  And if it's not an empty hallway aboard a ship, it's an empty hallway in a mining facility or an empty alley in the bowels of the Coruscant underworld. I thought the entire planet of Coruscant was a city. Why are there only 12 people at the public transportation depot? Six of them are thugs, the other six are victims being mugged.  When LucasArts wants to overwhelm you with numbers they'll throw eight maybe nine bad guys at you at once, but their ineptitude usually evens the odds in a hurry. Other than this, you get the usual assortment of third person adventure game puzzles and tasks that we've seen in every forgettable Tomb Raider clone since 1996 in Obi Wan.   The two player head to head mode is basically the single player game split onto two screens. You control your character exactly as you would in the main game and so does your buddy. The effect is that you're fighting an enemy, just like in the main game, except this enemy is being controlled by the guy or gal sitting next to you. The two player mode sounds better than it plays.  Graphics Maybe they should've just followed Obi Wan Kenobi's adventures when he was the old hermit living on Tatooine because it might have been easier to pull of in a videogame. The young, active Obi Wan like we saw in Episode I is flat and bland and he lives in a flat and bland galaxy far far away.   Nowhere is this more apparent than in the cut scenes. Powered by the game's engine even the shortest, most basic scenes look extremely flat with low polygon counts. Yoda, sitting in the Jedi Temple, looks more like an evil Gremlin than a wise old Jedi master because of his long angular face and wing-like ears. If Qui Gon's nose and beard didn't protrude so sharply from his face, you wouldn't know it was him. Of course, it makes him look more like the Green Goblin, but we're already mixing franchises as it is,  so don't worry about it. There are some outdoor areas that are so angular and lacking in detail that you'll swear you're playing a PlayStation One game.   Obi Wan himself is animated well enough with a wide variety of flips, rolls and jumps to go along with his arsenal of attack moves. He has a little problem with keeping his feet on the ground when he runs, but other than that and his frequent clipping, he's okay. The world he lives and fights in however is not so well animated. The waves of bad guys are hardly distinguishable from each other except by color because they all move like robots on a death march. For the battle droids this is okay. But introducing a new race to the Star Wars universe like the Jinn Ha by way of stale animation like this is a sure way to make them suck. Nobody is going to want to dress up as a Jinn Ha for Halloween because they're about as articulate as the original 1977 Star Wars action figures.   The Xbox would certainly have no problem lighting, drawing and animating Obi Wan's third person adventure if only LucasArts had held this game to a higher standard of beauty. As it stands now, you can see the team at LucasArts tried to get a few graphical tidbits out of this game (like elaborate shadowing on Obi Wan), but it all seems like an afterthought when you consider the basics that were missed.   Sound The music from the movie Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is featured throughout the game. If you never get tired of ~Duel of the Fates~ then you won't be disappointed. Likewise, the LucasArts library of sound effects served them well, as it always does, because the lightsabers, laser blasts and other effects are top notch and expertly reproduced.  It's the voices that are scary in Obi Wan. The voice actor for Obi Wan had quite a challenge in reproducing Ewan McGregor's take on Alec Guinness' original intonations and mannerisms. What you end up with is this new guy doing an impression of McGregor doing an impression of Guinness. Like audio cassettes and cookie recipes, the further away you get from the original, the worse things get. The stand-ins for Liam Neeson and Samuel L. Jackson don't get to suffer as much scrutiny because the name of the game is Obi Wan not, Qui Gon or Mace Windu.   For what it's worth, the battle droids with their cold metallic speech patterns ended up being the best voices in the game. By putting this game on the Xbox, LucasArts got a lot more spotlight on Obi Wan than if it had come out for PC, which was the original plan. With all of these gameplay warts, Obi Wan could've faded quietly into the sea of forgettable PC games and lived in anonymity in the bargain bin for years. But this is a game that could've been a reason to own an Xbox if LucasArts had tightened up all of the fundamental parts of the game that were lacking. And the sad part is, it would've been worth it. That's how much potential is here. Maybe Jedi Knight II, if and when it makes it over from PC, can deliver on the promise of lightsaber based excitement. Help us, Raven Software, you're our only hope.The cool parts of Obi Wan are very cool. There are moments where you can handle entire rooms full of enemies with a force push here, yanking a weapon there and a few well choreographed lightsaber swings. It can end up looking like your own custom created movie scene. The problem is Obi Wan doesn't facilitate this often enough for the gamer. You end up interacting with the game in an entirely different way. Put it this way, there were powerups I wouldn't go after simply because they were at the end of narrow walkways and I knew I couldn't align the camera properly to make it there and back. The Xbox is not the place for defensive gaming.That said with the Xbox library where it is, Obi Wan is worth a rent or borrow if only to experience a few of the cool Jedi powers.", "date": "Jan 3, 2002"}
