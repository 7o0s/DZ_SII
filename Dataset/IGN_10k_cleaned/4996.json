And I hope it's a really comfy place with some egg chairs and a kick-ass sound system with some killer bass. That way I will know for sure that the folks behind Technic Beat can have some happy thoughts because it's doubtful that such crazy games like this can ever sell enough to secure an early retirement.   The action in Technic Beat follows different characters as they run around a square arena and try to keep up with the music. Different elements of the music are represented by circles that appear on the ground. The timing for these is shown by another circle that grows from the middle and the perfect timing is when the two circles collide. In the simple form of the game, playing the songs is all a matter of being in the right place at the right time. Move around and activate the circles with good timing and everything's kosher. But the developers couldn't leave well enough alone with that. No way. They had to make a game that starts out by tossing pebbles around and ends up by going completely thermonuclear.   There are eight different levels of the game and if one hopes to even begin to comprehend the last few levels of difficulty, then some other techniques need to be used. In addition to activating the circles, characters can also move them around. If one circle is overlapping another circle when it's activated, then the other one is automatically triggered as well. This creates some combos that get even more fun because circles can be placed at the end of a currently triggered series of circles to keep the music going.     There are a couple of other tricks to play around with as well. By learning the different songs and the placement of the circles, it's possible to anticipate the next circles and place combos that will activate the as soon as they appear. It's also an option to use a super move that will set off all of the circles within a radius with perfect timing. This is mostly used as a last-minute device or a way to get through some particularly hairy sequences. Trust me, when you get up to level seven or, if you're really lucky, level eight, then you're going to be praying that you have super moves to last the entire song.   As far as the gameplay, that's really all there is to it. Different characters move around the screen with different moves and tactics, but for the most part this is a game that rewards a good memory and some lightning-fast reflexes. The huge song selection is fun to play around with and a few dozen classic videogame themes get a danceclub extended remix in order to make them even more bumping and fun to try and keep them going within the game.   What makes the game so endearing and fun is the insanity of it all and trying to control some sort of chaos and truly make your roommates think you've become insane. The songs run the risk of getting old and there is a worry about getting too inundated by it all, but if other rhythm games like Amplitude push your buttons, then this is another one worth your hard earned cash. And did we mention that you can find this one on shelves for a meager $15 new? Damn, it's almost a no brainer if you want something different to flush out your head from all those action games we know you've been playing. Definitely worth a look for some goofy rhythm madness to scare everyone else away.", "date": "Sep 20, 2004"}
