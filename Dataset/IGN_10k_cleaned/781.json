No PlayStation skating game is better than Pro Skater, and it's doubtful any will be until Tony Hawk 2. Get over it.   That being now said, we can talk about Street Sk8er 2, EA's sequel to the PlayStation's first skateboarding game. The developer Microcabin has taken that game completely apart, thrown away all the fat and puss, buttered up the graphics a ton, and reinvented the experience while retaining some of the few qualities worked well against Neversoft's far-superior Tony Hawk game. The result: a more arcade-like and crazy-absurd game that still bears more than a passing resemblance to Pro Skater (and still doesn't quite measure up) but drives in a few different directions.   Gameplay  Face to face against the other skateboarding games on the PlayStation (Tony Hawk, Thrasher, Street Sk8er, the upcoming Tony 2, MTV Skater, and Grind Session), Street Sk8er 2 initially falls into the trap these all have gone for -- it feels and plays just like another Pro Skater clone. With the possible exception of Thrasher, these games are interchangeable -- wail on the buttons for as many spins, flips, and board tricks you can get in, then correct your yaw before crashing brutally in the landing. Everything is grindable, and there's no focus on street skating -- it's all about getting air.  Street Sk8er 2 doesn't exactly diversify itself  here, but it does refine and simplify that arcade style of controls. This is a really simple game to get into. To make things even easier than the competition, landings are all handled by the computer, so long as you're not doing a trick at the time. That puts all the emphasis on your vertical stunts, where all the fun is. Thankfully, control has been improved tremendously over the first Street Sk8er. The challenge level on tricks is almost better than Tony Hawk in that you need to know what moves can transition to combos well and which just deliver big points. There are dozens of tricks per character, and knowing how high a ramp will launch you is key to deciding which trick to pull out of your gag bag.    While the trick system is standard, Street Sk8er 2 breaks from the pack in the approach to gameplay. Whereas Tony Hawk and its tag-alongs play like a free-roaming scavenger hunt, Street Sk8er 2 is a race from start to finish. There are all kinds of nooks and crannies to explore, but dawdle too long in any one part of the course and you'll suddenly find yourself out of time and up Crap Creek without a paddle. However, don't rush to the finish line without pulling out some gnarly stunts, because you also have to qualify for the next track while racing the clock. This game is urgent, and that feel is absolutely different from the other me-too skateboarding games.  Courses Where Street Sk8er 2 rocks is in the course design. These are possibly the best tracks in any skater this year. From piling heights in the San Francisco hills to eternal grinds on the streets of Miami, the tracks are rad. Unlike the first Street Sk8er, everything is grindable in this game -- even the tanks in Moscow! There are also a few tricks this game pulls off that were only hinted at in Tony Hawk. As your skater gets better and racks up skill points, he'll be able to launch up higher and jump farther, eventually reaching parts of the course that were off-limits at the beginning of the game. Escalators work and actually carry your rider against or with the motion. And there are all kinds of hidden spots that trigger background effects -- hit the button in the space museum and a mock shuttle takes off.   Graphics Cartoony but colorful, Street Sk8er looks nice in motion on the main tracks. Surfaces are clear and don't suffer the texture warping seen in Tony Hawk. Also, since this game has an international flavor, there are all kinds of details and nice effects that are unique to each course. The Russian track has huge tanks to throw down on (you can even grind the turret), London has moving cars and a beautiful night setting, and Washington D.C. is flocked with pigeons to stir up.  While the graphics are good, the framerate isn't so hot. Electronic Arts isn't exactly known for making smooth-running games, and this one follows suit. It's playable for the most part, but when in one of the game's special bonus ramp courses (which are very small and shouldn't tax the engine too much), the engine can jump from a startling 60 fps to a choppy 15 and below, and there is no way to tell what you're going to get next. Additionally, the camera is slow to shift, and that causes problems when rounding tough corners.   Multiplayer and Create-A-Park It will be interesting to see how Tony Hawk 2's course designer works, but it might have a hard time matching the features here in Street Sk8er 2. Building a park is easy and fun, and there are plenty of variables and track portions to play with. It's impossible to make the kind of amazing outdoor tracks seen in the actual game, but the mini-park restrictions still give plenty of creative freedom, and the resulting track looks perfectly natural.  The create-a-park feature of this game builds up its cred, but the multiplayer game tears it down. Choppy and slow, this feature chugs where it should soar. At times it runs at a playable rate, but the framerate can fluctuate anywhere from EA's subpar standard framerate to a slide show, and the constant slowdown and shift throws off the game quite a bit. There are also far fewer styles of multiplayer games than any other skating game -- the only deviation from the main game is a lame pool duel, where skaters try to take each other's boxes.  Sound Some big name bands, but there's not a lot to say about the audio otherwise. The announcer is a high-energy hip-hopper, but he never has anything interesting to say. Street sounds are authentic, and there are a few good extra effects (such as the bell that rings when you ride it), but there aren't many effects exclusive to the levels (no mad Russian music, no Big Ben ringing in the background). On the other hand, the music selection is very good, with tunes from Ministry, Del the Funky Homosapien, and even an EA contest winner (The Chick Magnets), and even though there aren't as many tracks as I'd hoped, the mix is good.  It's the style of gameplay that makes this game worth a look. With the clock ticking off every trick you do, this game is continuously pushing you out of a comfortable part of the course and further on to the different technical sections. Bad multiplayer, choppy graphics, and lagging cameras hurt this game some, but its still quite fun where it works well.  The game may be a bit less compared to... that other skateboarding game which has been mentioned far too many times already, but the focus of the gameplay, track design, and the smooth learning curve makes this a different game, and at times a more fun skateboarding experience.", "date": "Mar 16, 2000"}
