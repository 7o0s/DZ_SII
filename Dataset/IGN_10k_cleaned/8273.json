Sequels appear to take precedence over innovation, and sometimes developers simply capitalize on the successes of their predecessors or mentors, merely churning out the same drivel everyone else already has.      Alien Shooter Vengeance falls somewhere between the two.  Employing a 3/4 camera perspective (Diablo-style), players are thrust into the role of a mercenary, selling skills, guile, and brute force to the M.A.G.M.A. Corporation - which for some reason has experienced ~drastic personnel changes of late~.  This is an alien shooter, after all, so one could imagine that just like in the movies, the aliens tend to slightly outnumber the good guys.  The developers at Sigma did a fairly good job at creating an action-RPG where players blast away mercilessly upon a virtual never-ending sea of alien critters.  While suffering from numerous minor flaws, the game still has an inherent classic, throw-back charm that insidiously beckons for the player to keep playing again and again.  Is it point and click action 99% of the time?  Sure.  But it is wickedly addictive and fun - for a while.    The game is comprised of three main game modes: Campaign, Survival, and Stand Firm.  The latter two are essentially ~the player versus the world~ type scenarios, where enemies are constantly swarming and never give in - but these will be addressed later.  The real meat of the game is in the Campaign, and the game offers quite a bit of variety, configurability, and customization to suit the average action-RPG lover.     The opening lines of the game manual are priceless, stating ~we consider your employment to be 'at will', and you may terminate it at any time~.  Then M.A.G.M.A. offers this friendly warning: conversely, ~your work with us reserves our right to terminate you.~  They don't, however, mean simply not sending the bi-weekly pay-checks anymore.  If they're not happy with your performance, you'll pay for it - in blood.   There are no unique character classes per se; rather, the player selects a Special Ability upon creating a character.  I personally love some of the abilities like Self-Treatment (which constantly regenerates hit points), Vampire (draining baddies' health), and Hypnotist (garnering the ability to briefly control the fairly basic minds of the aliens).  There are also the options for Economist, Night Vision, Observer, and even the Boxer (yes, that's right - excelling in hand-to-hand combat with some of the nastiest creatures you've ever seen).  After choosing a special ability, one chooses a particular character with a unique personality, who excels in certain areas, while suffering in others.    This is where the level-building element comes into play, as experience is gained as aliens are disposed of.  One can improve on health capacity, strength, speed, aim, intelligence, and also on one's ability to wield weapons with special expertise.  For example, upon slaughtering a predetermined number of alien scum, the player may be awarded with five experience points to use.  Three could be assigned to make the player faster, and two could be used to improve the efficiency of the character's use of the game's different weapons: pistols, shotguns, miniguns & rifles, rocket launchers & grenade launchers, and flamethrowers & energy weapons.  I made a personal effort to make my shotgun proficiency particularly high, even though I probably should have spread it out more across the different weapon categories - there are a TON of weapons from each category.  As money is awarded for completing missions, or found scattered about the levels in open (or secret) areas, new weapons, armor, ammunition, and intelligence implants can be purchased, usually after each mission has come to some sort of ambiguous conclusion, further advancing the storyline.   The game's story is fairly weak. All the player really knows is that he needs to stay alive, keep someone else alive, or switch on some generator (or some other mundane task) to keep the game progressing.  Trapped in the M.A.G.M.A. facility - which is inherently inundated with extra-terrestrial evil - despite the varying mission imperatives, the main objective remains the same: conserve your ammo, be agile, and stay alive.      So how does the game play?  It is fast and furious, as well as frustrating and unforgiving.  Because of the fixed camera view, projectiles are fired on a two-dimensional plane.  This essentially means that you don't actually need to ~aim~ directly at an enemy - just the path that you know it will take.  For example, when leading the brainless aliens to a bottleneck at a doorway, the player simply needs to fire 10 feet towards the swarm of enemies, and anything passing into the stream of fire will be hit.  Simply employ the tactic of saturation fire and success is easily attainable.  This wouldn't be such a complaint if it wasn't for the game's difficulty level.     Unless the player wishes to be subjected to the (aptly named) Impossible difficulty level, the game is far too easy, even on hard.  Whenever an objective needs to be completed, green arrows are placed on the ground, showing the player exactly where to be going next. Sure, you'll run out of ammo sometimes, but if you're smart about weapon upgrades and ammo conservation, the game almost plays itself.  One simply needs to hold down the left mouse button to spray bullets, flames, rockets, or energy beams.  Further, until the player is able to afford the more powerful weapons, the cheaper ones have virtually instantaneous reload rates.  For example, an MP5 (which the player holds one handed, gangsta style - a nice touch) with 2000 rounds of reserve ammunition essentially translates into a 2000-bullet clip.  Conversely, you won't be complaining about the rapid rate of fire of the weapons on the highest difficultly level    The Survival and Stand Firm modes can be fun as a distraction from the game's main ~story~, as the player is overwhelmed with alien opposition from all angles on a fixed map.  Survival has the levels and weapons progress as the player proves his worthiness, gaining experience and new skills, while Stand Firm simply pits the player against the enemies with a basic arsenal, and has no chance of improving stats along the way.   Among the game's frustrations is the extremely poor path-finding.  By right clicking the player can send the character to the pointed destination - but he will travel on a straight path.  If there's a wall, road barrier, or barrel in the way, it matters not, for the character will still run in a straight line. Regardless, it's never difficult to execute some aliens, so perhaps it evens out in the end.   Graphically the game, as aforementioned in the first paragraph in this review, is a bit of a throw-back.  By no means revolutionary, nor very archaic, the graphics are more of a means to an end.  They're nice, but not beautiful.  The lighting, shadow, rain, particle, and explosion effects are fairly decent, and rarely force the game to stutter, let alone slow down, even at times when there may be 50 or more aliens on the screen at a time.  There is a ton of blood and gore, but the animations are weak and uninspired.  The characters are jerky and move without spirit, and each alien has but one death animation, usually simply being gibbed to bits or splattering its red goo abound.    The game really shows its charm through its atmospheric dynamic music.  From slow, creepy, ominous, chilling tunes, to intense techno-metal riffs, the designers did an excellent job in truly making the player fear what lay around the next corner.  Although, once you've played the game for more than 10 minutes, you know what's around the next corner: about 37 bloodthirsty aliens.  But I digress.     Despite the great music, the game really suffers from poor-mediocre voice acting.  Not only is it not all that believable, but it detracts from the level of immersion - even as a mindless point and click shooter, it's pretty lame when one character is pretty much about to die, but calmly (and in a whiny, untrained voice) asks you if you wouldn't mind maybe doing something about it.  The sound effects are great, from rapid-firing shotguns to rocket propelled grenades.  Alien Shooter Vengeance is a bit of a niche title, as its gameplay and interface are more reminiscent of older action-RPGs.  This by no means is fault in of itself.  The game is what it is  and its a lot of fun.  However, marred by various minor nuisances, and ultimately simple and repetitive gameplay, some gamers may tire quickly.  This title is recommended if youre simply looking for some quick, mindless fun.  Further, at a budget titles price of $19.99, there is some greater incentive for the more casual gamer to give it a try, especially with the relatively modest system requirements.", "date": "Mar 23, 2007"}
