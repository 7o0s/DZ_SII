Well, for its time, anyway. Sure, it's been out-done by the excellent Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling, but ASC still has a good game engine in its hands, and the company's not going to let it go to waste.  Enter the Animaniacs. What ASC and developer Saffire have done is wackified (is that a word?) Ten Pin Alley by throwing Yakko, Wakko, Dot, Pinky, Hello Nurse, and other characters from the Warner Bros. cartoon show. But that's not all  weird things will happen if you time them properly: balls will bounce like rubber, shatter into rubble against the pins, even swerve all crazy-like as it cruises down the lane at top-speed.  The problem here is, even though it looks like a kids game, it sure doesn't feel like one. The interface, the same exact one that was used in the original Ten Pin Alley, isn't very inviting for kids who don't know what each of the meters mean or how to relate them to realworld measurements. Heck, the first time I played Ten Pin Alley I couldn't figure it out right off the bat, so how does ASC expect a ten-year-old to do the same with this version? To top it off, the style will also alienate true bowling fans with its exaggerated, uncontrollable physics. You may have timed the throw accurately, but that ball sometimes has a mind of its own.  On the positive side, each of the Animaniacs characters are rendered and animated extremely well, given that they had to have been shoe-horned into an existing game engine. Each of the characters has their own little animations when you score and foul, accompanied by a sound-bite from the real actors who provide the voices.  Animaniacs Ten Pin Bowling is an odd game  it's difficult to give this game a final rating. If you like the Animaniacs and like bowling, give it a shot. Unfortunately, I doubt you're going to find a lot of people who fit that criteria. Kids will probably be frustrated with the controls, and it's a good chance older gamers won't care for the randomness.  -- Craig Harris", "date": "Jan 12, 1999"}
