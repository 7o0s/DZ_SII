And that for some reason volleyball left them a bit confused. With Ace Combat 6, you get to be Maverick. Or Goose or Iceman if you prefer, but the point is that you won't be able to play the game without at least once saying, ~I'm gonna put on the brakes and he'll fly right by.~ And now that the Ace Combat series has made its way to Xbox 360, you can say that to a friend on the other side of the world in the midst of an adrenaline-pumping online match.   That's really the success of this game. It looks real enough and you're inside a real jet cockpit, but you can still be that imaginary ace that you've built up in your head all these years. Nose diving towards an ocean, only to pull up at the last minute in a gravity-defying move that sends you underneath a bridge while barrel rolling, of course, can be a reality. And you never run out of ammo, because the war is on your shoulders and you absolutely need to blow up every last thing on your radar, even if it is a radio tower on your home turf. The story doesn't really make sense. The giant flying manta ray looking enemy base you fight certainly doesn't either. But it doesn't matter, because you're in an F-22A that has over 200 explosives hidden somewhere on it and it controls just like you always dreamt it wouldeven if that isn't totally realistic.     Click here to watch the co-op video   The campaign mode spans 15 missions and can be tackled in roughly five or six hours, if you're good. Add in some deaths and mission failures and you'll probably come close to double that time. That in itself is a pretty good chunk of gameplay, but the real meat of the game comes in replaying missions to unlock everything and taking the battle online. The amount of replay value you can get out of Ace Combat 6 really is quite high.    The mission structure does a great job of simultaneously making you feel like you're part of a large war in the midst of chaos and giving you the impression that you're ultimate hero. Too much inaction and the war will seem staged. Too much destruction and you'll just feel like a bystander. With Ace Combat 6, you're part of a much larger operation, lending your support to ground and air engagements that already pit dozens of units to a side.    It's your choice as to how you'll support the rest of your army, too, which is where the aforementioned replay value begins to come into play. Most missions offer multiple objectives, sometimes up to six. To succeed, you'll only have to complete a few of them and then finish off whatever extra surprise is tossed your way at the end. In fact, it's impossible to complete them all in one sortie. To fill out your medal chest, you'll need to go back in and tackle the mission from a different angle. When you do, you'll find the levels play significantly different depending upon which order you move through the objectives as the tide of the battle shifts in new ways. The aircraft handling and their load-outs are all greatly different from one another, adding yet another wrinkle to a second or third run through the same mission. And when things start to get boring, you can always try the extreme mode that gets unlocked when you beat the game.     The only real frustrating part to the mission structure, and this has been happening for years in games like Ace Combat 6, is the surprise objectives. Before each mission you can see which type of units you'll need to attack and can select your craft and special weapon accordingly, but you'll never know what new twist is going to be thrown at you. Nothing is more annoying than playing a mission for 15 or 20 minutes only to find out that your bomber is utterly useless against the fast fighters tossed your way at the end.   It never gets to the point where you have to reset your game, thanks in large part to the easy to use wingman controls. Through much of the game, you'll just set your second Garuda team member to either attack or cover your tail. He doesn't do that great of a job of either. However, by building up a meter through the course of battle, you can activate a full allied attack or cover, both of which wreak havoc on enemy forces. Smart weapon selection combined with this tactic used at the right time can simply devastate the enemy. And nothing could be more satisfying than watching the kill list in the upper left-hand corner get spammed with enemy names.    And, of course, we can't say enough about how pretty the environments look. The battlefields are sprawling beasts, littered with active and inactive targets for you to feast on. The water, skies, and cloud features are near photorealistic and while the ground cover could perhaps look better up close, we're not complaining at all. Yeah, it's a bit disappointing that the licensed aircraft make it impossible for Namco Bandai to use real world locations, but that is all but made up for when you face off against one of the sci-fi monstrosities that serve as a couple of ~boss~ stages.    The only other visual thing that we would ask for is a more feature-laden ground to give the game a better sense of speed. Down in a river valley or when cruising just above the ocean, the adrenaline rush you get from the scenery rushing by is fantastic. Move just a bit off of the ground, though, and the game just doesn't feel fast. A few stages that make use of weather effects manage to give the sensation of tearing through the sky back to the player, but not every stage is designed to be exhilarating all of the time. And with the arcade design, we're not looking for a realistic velocity on our jets.    In between each mission, players are treated (submitted?) to a few cutscenes that tell the stories of the people on the ground caught up in the war. It's a good idea, in theory, and it does add an extra dimension to the faces on enemies and allies on the battlefield. But man, if the dialogue in Ace Combat 6 could ever use some work. We're just guessing here, but out of roughly 500 lines of dialogue, about 495 of them have to do with dancing with angels. We get it. Planes are angels and they dance in the sky. Clever. Stop.    So you'll skip the cutscenes after you've suffered through them once. You'll probably skip replaying the campaign at first, too, once you discover the joys of online dog fighting. An attack and defend siege mode, free for all, team battle, and co-op play are all in with a good number of maps and the promise of more to come with downloadable content. All told, there are 13 distinct ways to play online on the disc alone.     The co-op missions are loose translations of what you find in the campaign mode, but they're a great deal more fun with a few friends. Unlike the offline game, you can die and respawn to join the battle. However, you'll be penalized time. Die too much, and your squad will find the ticker running out before they can complete the mission. These are so fun that it makes us wish the entire game could be played this way. As it is, there are just two co-op missions on the disc.   The rest of the missions are all fairly self-explanatory. It's the great controls and wide range of planes and weapons to pick from that seal the deal. None of the missiles that we've toyed with are sure kills if you know how to dodge properly, listen to the warning signals, and watch your radar. This makes the game exponentially more fun when more people are added and things get really crazy, but it also makes the game less ~cheap~ as it requires some skill to knock a talented pilot out of the sky. Or at least a few people to distract him or her while you catch them off guard.     The online lobby system works well, though the presentation could use some work. A few blocky screens and no explanation as to what the difference between Team Battle 1 and Team Battle 2 are don't do much to inspire. There aren't any clans, either, which is disappointing because making your own squadron and owning the sky would be fantastic fun. Also, why can I call for support to the other players with the d-pad in a free for all game and why are they all on the Alpha squadron? You can't have everything, it appears.  Ace Combat 6 isn't a perfect game. A lot about the presentation feels dated, the dialogue is drab, and though the sound effects are done well, the constant beeping that warns of incoming missiles is a bit much. But what Ace Combat 6 does well, it nails. The realistic visual design married with the arcade controls make for a game that anyone can have fun with. This is the closest to the imaginary dream of being in Top Gun that most of us are ever going to get.", "date": "Oct 20, 2007"}
