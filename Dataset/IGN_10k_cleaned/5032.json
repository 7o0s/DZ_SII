Oh, sure, we've got our fair share of titles, but nothing really world rocking. The Wayne Gretzky series plays a good game of NHL Jam but doesn't really appeal to realism fans, and NHL Breakaway '98, while a halfway decent start from Acclaim, needed a lot of gameplay refinement to equal the efforts of EA Sports on the PC and PlayStation.  So, it's with great relief to hockey fanatics that the company who made hockey a yearly event on game systems has finally made the move. EA Sports has finally graced the N64 with a version of its NHL series. And that gap has been filled, this game is a doozie.  The Facts:   Official NHL and NHLPA licence: All teams and players are represented, including the Nashville Predators expansion team. Medium-High Resolution at 30 FPS Commentary by ESPN's Bill Clement Season statistics tracking, including trades Rumble-pack support Four player   The Gameplay  Let's start by simply saying this: if you've ever played NHL 98 on the PC or PlayStation, the N64 version is based on that design. As EA Canada worked on NHL 99 for the PlayStation and PC, EA Sports farmed out the N64 development to an outside source, MBL Research. Because of time restraints, the N64 team based most of the design on the existing NHL 98 source, only adding a few features that made it into the NHL 99 development.  So what we have is an excellent conversion of NHL 98. Unfortunately, the new features that the PC and PlayStation versions received aren't here. Features like new, more dynamic player animations and training drills, even the newly-modified crease size and wider space behind the goals are nowhere to be found in the N64 cartridge. But you'll get the new shot meter (that displays how hard your slap-shots will be) as well as calculations on how fast a shot was (in MPH).  Players set up shots as realistically as possible, but there are a handful of instances, like surprise breakaways, you're wondering what logic they're using -- but in its favor no hockey AI has ever been perfect.  The one irritation is in the player collision detection. If a defensemen even so much as gives your player a tap when he has the puck, your player will almost come to a complete stop. Very irritating when you're on offense and have a direct line to the goal. Other than that, NHL 99 is a fine playing hockey game with good controls, a load of features and an addictive four-player mode.  Graphics  Flat-out, this game is a stunner. While not quite the system's high-resolution, NHL 99 features an extremely crisp, fantastically smooth 3D engine that blows the crap out of Wayne Gretzky and NHL Breakaway - and there's never a drop in the animation. Having such a good graphic engine is key for a fast-action sporting event like hockey, and MBL Research shocked us with what it had done with its first N64 development.  What's more, the game is very vibrant in its colors - the ice is a drab white (this isn't a complaint), but the player, crowd and rink textures jump out with an impressive color scheme and crisp resolution. If you're just looking at graphics, NHL 99 on the N64 is second only to the PC 3Dfx version, and really puts the dull PlayStation NHL engine (even NHL 99's) to shame.  And while the animation isn't as detailed as what showed up in other versions, the motion-capturing in the N64 version is ample and very realistic. Players spin and check with realism, and the goalies have a huge library of their own moves when they go up to block shots. Sound  Okay, we're obviously not expecting broadcast quality commentary from the press booth since this is a cartridge, but come on -- EA just hasn't offered the goods in the play-by-play on the N64 yet, and NHL 99 is probably the worst example because it sticks out like a sore thumb. Bill Clement, commentator for ESPN, offers some of the lamest, most generic comments during the game, and some are just painful to hear. The nominee for the worst play call goes to NHL 99: nail an offensive man hard, and hear Clement exclaim, ~A freight train! Choo-choo!~ Let's get EA in touch with Factor 5 for some compression routines, then we may actually hear some competent play-by-play next season.  But aside from the so-called color commentary, NHL 99 offers some excellent audio, from the ripping soundtrack in the title sequence and menus, to the organ music between plays, to the auditorium chants during plays. And if you've got a receiver, the audio is in vibrant Dolby Surround.  Control  EA Sports' NHL series is nearly a decade old, so the company knows how the game should be played -- and the N64 version is no exception. The one thing that is really commendable is the fact that the developers somehow knew that many players will prefer playing the game with the digital pad. You can obviously play the game with analog control, but most NHL 99 players will be coming from older versions, and that means 8-way direction for the masses.  And because it's an EA Sports game, the general control carries over from the other games, so if you're used to passing in NBA Live and Madden, the same button is used in NHL. The extra buttons have been given on-the-fly play selection commands. The only problem here is they're a little TOO accessible, so if you've got a big thumb you may accidentally hit the play-call button when you're trying to check an offensiveman.  But if you've ever played NHL in any incarnation, there's little-to-no learning curve here.  Head-to-head This year's N64 version looks and plays better than last year's PSX -- and even PC version. But unfortunately, it lacks some of the cool additions, regulation changes and cinematics of NHL 99 on the PlayStation and PC this year. On the bright side, the N64 NHL 99 runs a whole lot smoother than the rather choppy PSX NHL 99. Which version should you get? If you're a PC junkie and you've got the right equipment, there should be no doubt that the PC NHL 99 delivers the best gameplay. In the console department, casual hockey fans will be more than satisfied with the N64 version. If you own both consoles and you already have last year's NHL 98 for PSX, then go for NHL 99 on PlayStation. If you only have an N64, don't despair. NHL 99 on N64 is a fantastic debut for the hockey series and will have four-players go at it for days on end.I'm approaching the N64 version a little unfairly, since I've played thePlayStation version to death (hey, it's my job!). But hey, if it's going tohave the same label on the box, you'd expect the same game design, right?Well, what N64 owners got was a great port of NHL 98, not NHL 99.I was stunned when I saw how beautiful the game looked. I was a littleconcerned after seeing the muddy graphics used in NHL Breakaway and WayneGretzky Hockey, but the developer really pulled off a hell of an engine.The game looks gorgeous.But the downsides just can't be overlooked. First, it's missing the newcrease ruling that's part of the 1998-1999 season. How hard would it havebeen to adjust the rink graphics to represent the smaller crease? And thecommentary -- ugh. Okay, I can understand the limitations of the cartridge,but what's here is just pathetic.If you're looking for the hockey game for the N64, this is it. Whileit's not quite as thorough as the PlayStation and PC versions, it plays adamn fine game of hockey. This is a great foundation for next year...I can'twait to see what next year brings us.", "date": "Oct 15, 1998"}
