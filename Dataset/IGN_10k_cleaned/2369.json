{"name": "Soccer America: International Cup", "name_review": "Soccer America International Cup", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/12/11/soccer-america-international-cup", "text": "Released under the title of Greatest Striker in Japan (just a notch below Perfect, which had already been taken), this Taito-developed Soccer game has been brought over to the States by Bay Area publisher Hot B. But instead of just releasing the game as is, the company has decided to spice things up a bit by making use of several popular licenses including Diadora, the world-renowned Italian manufacturer of soccer apparel, and the title's new namesake, Soccer America, which is the #1 soccer publication in the United States.   Now called Soccer America International Cup, this soccer game was released in June with almost no marketing and a complete lack of fanfare. It's too bad, though, because Soccer America is a better than average game of soccer. It just doesn't have the looks to match-up against EA Sports' FIFA or Konami's Pro Evolution games, it's feature set is abysmal in comparison to what's offered in FIFA 2002 and Konami's latest Pro Evolution is a much more convincing of a simulation.   Gameplay One of Soccer America's more unique qualities is that it offers a beginner one-button control scheme where everything is handled by the X button for those not smart enough to press anything else. If this sounds like something for you, then by all means give it a shot. But, it's definitely not the best way to play the game.   With the game's normal, more advanced, control setup this can be a fairly accurate and fun to play simulation of the world's most popular sport. You can pretty much do all of the things you would want to do in a soccer videogame, including stuff like dash, changing players, shoot, slide, short pass, lob pass, tackle and through pass.   Plus, you can do some more advanced things like change your team's play on the fly by simply hitting the L1 button and have your player perform more advanced moves like crossovers and crossovers that are tied to a shot, short pass, long pass, or through pass.   The players are very responsive to your controller movements, but some might not like the way that shots and passes are handled. The game's developers have opted to choose realism over instant responsiveness, so when you press the button to pass or shoot, the player won't instantly perform these moves unless he's in position to do it. Those that want instant reaction won't like this, but this does provide for a more realistic simulation of the sport and it makes you think out your moves more than you would had this stuff been carried out otherwise.   The AI provides a pretty good challenge and if you play the game on the hardest difficulty setting you can expect to have a hard time scoring if you don't play yourself a really smart game. The scores tend to be much more down to Earth than most other soccer videogames and 1-0 and tie games are much more common than big 10-8 shootouts, which is definitely a good thing.  My biggest complaint about the gameplay is that there aren't really any great camera angles. The TV and Standard camera angles are much too close to the field and don't let you get a good view of the play field. And while you do get a good look of the field with the Wide camera angle, it's a little too far away, especially when you have control of the ball on the far end of the field.   Features As touched upon earlier, this game is pretty weak in way of features. It just has your basic exhibition, Cup, League and Shootout modes with a few sub modes in each and the roster of teams in the game tops out at around 36 different teams from around the world. You get the most important ones, such as USA, Japan, Brazil, Germany, France, Italy, England and Argentina, but you miss out on all the league teams like the ones in the MLS or English Premiership.   The only thing worth mentioning is that there's a fairly unique World Ranking Mode in the Cup play that lets you take a Under 23 team and make it stronger for earning different points for passing, shooting and dribbling. You get awarded points for doing certain things on the field of play and your team's skill will go up accordingly. Even with this, Soccer America's feature set is pretty bare bones.  Graphics Visually, Soccer America International Cup offers an odd mix of really good and really bad. On the really good side, the stadiums are very detailed and have a lot going on in the backgrounds. When you play in a different stadium you can really tell the difference and the details just don't end with the waving flags in the stands and the moving people in the stands. There are actually viewable objects outside of the stadiums including large skyscraper buildings, horses in a pasture and animated windmills.   Furthermore, there are a lot of great things being done with the lighting, shadowing and environmental effects in the game. The time of day actually changes as you play through a game and the lighting on the field and players and the shadows that each cast changes accordingly. What's more, the stadium shadows will in fact cast shadows on the players and not just the field, meaning that when players run into the shadows they'll get appear darker. Weather will also change dynamically as you're playing through some games. It might start off with a light rain or snow flurry and progress to a hard downpour or heavy snowfall.   On the bad side, while there are some realistic animations for things like stopping balls, stumbling, and picking up the ball for a throw-in and the variety in player animation is high, general movement lacks fluidity and is a bit on the stiff side. Likewise, the player models are a bit on the blocky side as the players have sharp elbows, very defined corners and aren't shaped smoothly and in a lifelike manner.   The game's worst graphical flaw, though, is the fact that it suffers from an overabundance of the ever so popular jaggies and flickering. The background flicker in this game is pretty intense and it really hurts the overall look of the game.   Sound The audio is one of the areas where most sports games seem to suffer, as some developers seem to be stuck back in the Stone Age where we didn't have all of this extra storage space to plunk down a nice variety of voice samples and commentary tracks. And while on the subject of poor commentary and weak sound in a sports game, we should mention that the audio in Soccer America International Cup is pretty weak, even when compared to other games that fail to excel in this area.  The play-by-play and color work are both extremely dry and very repetitive. What's even worse is that neither guy does a good job of even faking that they're in the same booth as the comments made by the announcer and color man never sound like they're talking to each other.   The non-commentary sound is also pretty poor, as even though there are some different crowd noises based on the stadium you're playing in, all you get throughout the game in that stadium is the same cheer or chant over and over again. The crowd noise doesn't seem to change at all based on what's happening in the game and usually becomes a bit on the annoying side when you play long games.  Soccer America International Cup feels like a low budget soccer game even though it's probably not one. The AI seems pretty advanced and finely tuned and those looking for a serious soccer simulation might be pleased with some of the things that this game has to offer. However, casual fans of the sport will get much more out of a game like FIFA 2002 and those more serious about the sport probably already have developed some sort of a liking for either EA's game or Konami's Pro Evolution series.", "date": "Dec 11, 2001"}
