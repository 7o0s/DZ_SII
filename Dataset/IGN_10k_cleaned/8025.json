In fact, EA's had two years' experience bringing the Nintendo DS FIFA titles, with various levels of success, but at the very least FIFA 07 was a good, solid dual-screen rendition.  So, Konami had something to shoot for when it revealed that the Winning Eleven move was finally leaping onto the Nintendo portable. But the final product is surprisingly minimalist and doesn't really speak for just how great the series is on other platforms. It's not bad, and there's the whole aspect of finally getting a sports game that plays over the internet, but when it comes to soccer competition on the DS, Konami still has a bit of catching up to do.   Let me at least get this out in the open right away: the Nintendo DS isn't really the best platform to get the ultimate sports experience. Of the systems currently on the market the DS comes in an easy last place in terms of system power and media sizes, so to expect the same amount of presentation in the same sports titles that's pushed on current generation console systems is a little out there. Companies do make at least a valiant attempt even with the shorter development cycles, weaker hardware and smaller cartridge sizes, and at least when it comes to FIFA, EA's managed to keep the DS version at a level that, while still not nearly as intense an experience as one you'd get on PS2 or Xbox, is comparable if you understand the restrictions.   So, with three versions of FIFA already in the handheld's library, it's time for Konami to show the DS world that it's got the handheld soccer game to own.    Winning Eleven plays adequately but a little on the rigid side. Manual control makes the game feel a little stiff switching characters using the shoulder button. Semi-automatic player switching alleviates this problem somewhat, but then you run into the problem of occasionally gaining control over the player you didn't want. The computer AI shows its weakness in predictable patterns and routines, and it's easy to break through and find the openings at least in the single player mode...even in its most difficult settings.   The limited and sprite-like robotic animations of the 3D player models definitely attribute to the overall starchy feel of the gameplay. And that little nasty bout of slowdown when players start clustering around the goal for an intense shot attempt is a little sobering and shows that the engine might've needed a little more work. It's not as if the programmers didn't shave a few corners here and there in favor of getting the game moving at a decent clip; dig the low-resolution textures and the flat-top haircuts on all the players.   The limitations don't kill the game, though, and Winning Eleven on the Nintendo DS isn't a bust. It is, after all, the first real-world sports game to hop online via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. The support is nicely implemented when it works, though half the time we connected in some of the worst lag imaginable. The other half we could definitely feel a slight drag in the action that told us we're dealing with long-distance match-ups, but it was certainly playable and a welcome addition...even if the actual soccer game isn't as top-notch as it is on other platforms. Local battles are definitely better since the lag is non-existent, and you can also hop into single cartridge matchups against a system that lacks a copy of the game. Take that, FIFA.      Where FIFA's strength is in its gameplay, Konami at least went the route of external features. If you're a ~customization~ nut then you'll probably have a field day with what you can do within Winning Eleven DS outside of the match. Teams and players can be renamed and saved on the cartridge, and you can earn and form a custom team. But in terms of presentation, this game fails big time. No commentary and no victory cutscenes are evident anywhere in the product. It's just a cut-and-dried game of soccer with no frills to jazz up its energy.  You want the ultimate, fantastic soccer experience, you're not going to get it on the Nintendo DS. It's just that simple. Hardware limitations keep portable sports from reaching the heights of console productions. But, that said, they certainly can be good and fun as proven by handheld developers. Even with the compromises Winning Eleven for the Nintendo DS is a let down simply due to the DS team not keeping the same tight competition the console teams have with it and the FIFA franchise. Online play is definitely a welcome addition, but it's not enough to make it the must-have game of soccer on the DS. Go with the latest FIFA for the time being...but don't count out a fierce DS soccer battle between the two franchises for 2008.", "date": "Feb 9, 2007"}
