In-Fusio's Shado Fighter really upped the ante last year, but no bruiser has come close to matching its playability -- until now. This beefy brawler, set in a mystical past full of bloody battles between humans and monsters, is the most accessible -- and ultimately fun -- mobile fighter I have ever had the pleasure of reviewing.   Medieval Combat: Age of Combat does not rival Street Fighter for depth, but it is not without a heavy dose of personality and playability. The cast is full of fantasy staples, such as brave Arthurian warrior, scantily-clad rogues, and brutish devils. Each fighter has their own look and move set, with some of the bigger combatants dealing out powerful (but slow) deathblows, while slighter fighters use speed to their advantage. In this respect, Medieval Combat regains some of the depth lost by streamlining the control options.   This not to the detriment of the game at all. Medieval Combat's fighting mechanics are sound; the controls are refreshingly uncomplicated. The ~5~ key unleashes a basic attack, while ~8~ is a heavy attack. Pressing these two keys either in a specific order or repeatedly will dish out some pretty hefty combos. If you are close to your opponent, double-tapping the thumbpad in their direction will instigate a grab attack, which you can then augment by slamming on the attack button to create a combo.   In addition to melee attacks, each character can unleash magic attacks of varying degrees of ferocity. A simple tap on the ~0~ key will toss out your basic fireball-esque volley, but if the button is held when the magic meter (located at the bottom of the screen) is red, the game slows to a crawl. In these few seconds, you must feverishly tap a combination of directions on the thumbpad. Nail the combo and your fighter lets loose with some potent magic. Always thinking one step ahead, Gameloft has also included a taunt system that drains your opponent's magic. Pressing ~2~ will cause you to tease the competition. While this may steal some sorcery, you leave yourself open to attack.   Every fighter is covered in armor that can be broken away during the course of battle. Certain heavy blows will peel away helmets and chest plates, revealing weak flesh for the piercing. This dynamic gives Medieval Combat additional depth, as you will find yourself risking your safety by unloading slower heavy attacks in hopes of stripping your enemy.   Medieval Combat has a variety of game play options. The Arcade mode is not unlike what you would expect. After choosing your fighter, you start thrashing enemy fighters until reaching the final boss. Defeating the boss unlocks a hidden character, and then it's time to do it again, but on a higher difficulty. The instant play mode lets you choose a new fighter between each round. Survival is a last-man-standing contest where you see how many opponents you can gore before finally falling. There are also training and tutorial modes for beginners to learn the ropes.   A word about the difficulty settings: Easy is too easy. I started playing the game on its lowest difficulty setting just to get the hang of the controls and see the sights, and never died once. Not even against the boss. The medium difficulty offers a much more reasonable challenge, as I'm not exactly a fan of cakewalks.   I played Medieval Combat on an LG VX8000m which features a sizeable, bright screen. The game looks fantastic. the fighter models are colorful and detailed, with rippling muscles and ornate armor. The backgrounds, while somewhat static, are exquisitely hand-drawn and do not distract from the action. The audio is also quite good. The fighting is accented by the clanks of steel on steel, and victory or defeat is marked with the appropriate audio flourish.  This summer's offerings from Gameloft have been plentiful and full of quality. Medieval Combat equals Midnight Bowling as my favorites, with War of the Worlds firmly in second place. This fighter is full of replay value, as hardcore fighting fans will want to try out each bruiser to see who has the moves and the magic best suited for their playing style. I appreciated the simplified controls, even if using them in tandem with each other made the game feel more complex than it actually is. And the 2D visuals really aim for the heart of this old-school gamer. If you have any interest in getting a mobile brawler, make Medieval Combat your top choice.", "date": "Aug 15, 2005"}
