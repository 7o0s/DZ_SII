{"name": "Primal Rage", "name_review": "Primal Rage", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/26/primal-rage", "text": "It was inevitable. ~Jurassic Park~ was such a hit at the theaters, there just had to be a dinosaur fighter. Primal Rage was popular at the arcades, sporting some of the smoothest motion-captured fighting this side of Mortal Kombat. The PlayStation version does live up to its coin-op predecessor.  All seven dinosaurs and big apes are all here, from Diablo to Vortex, and their  special moves are all here as well. That's every arcade move and fatality, plus a Tug-of-War mode and an endurance mode. In short, it's pretty much arcade perfect. However, Time warner could've added some new characters or moves, but as it stands, it's a faithful reproduction.  For all its motion-captured goodness, Primal Rage is still just a 2D fighter, and pales in comparison to most of the 3D fighters now available. I mean, even Mortal Kombat has gone 3D in the arcades with War Gods. But if you liked the coin-op Primal Rage, chances are you'll like the PSX version too.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
