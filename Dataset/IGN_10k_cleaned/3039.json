The game is fun, addictive, and could possibly be the simplest game every made, even more so than Pong.  Heck, you don't even use any buttons in the game.  And how could you not like the little fellow himself?  He's cute, yellow, and always has a smile on his face too.   Almost a quarter of a century since his introduction, the Pac himself is back in a new 3D platforming game that borrows from all the staples of the said genre.  A little Mario here, a dash of Sonic there, and a pinch of Crash thrown in to spice up the mix a little.  For the final touch, there's a whole lotta Pac-man to tie it all together.  GameplayThe story behind Pac-man World 2 can only be described as thrilling and provocative.  You would never guess the plot twists and betrayals found in this game's first level.  Sounds unreal, right?  To tell you the truth, the story is more basic than playing the original Pac-man.  Some ghosts steal the golden fruit off a tree in Pac-land, unleashing the great ghost Spooky, who has been imprisoned by the golden fruit for hundreds of years.  Your job is to retrieve the golden fruit and put Spooky back in his place, plain and simple. It seems Pac-man has been keeping himself busy over the years and learned a few new tricks.  Not only can he jump, he can flip-kick, shimmy, swim, and even do a charging role, not unlike a certain blue hedgehog.  Pulling of t he'se moves is just as easy as it was to move him around those old colored mazes.  The A button jumps, and X will make Pac-man run in place, charging up his spin attack.  Pressing A while airborne will perform a butt-bounce (useful for hitting switc he's and killing goomb...enemies), and the Y button is used as a context-sensitive action button.  Left stick moves Pac-man while the right stick will adjust the camera.  Who ever said you can't teach an old Pac new tricks?  Pac-man World 2 follows the platforming textbook so closely, you'd think the game were on your junior-high honor roll.  Collectable tokens, carefully timed jumps, and water, snow, and lava worlds are the name of this game.  The actual world structure is very reminiscent of Super Mario World.  You travel from level to level on a scaled down map of the world, being able to go back and reply any levels you complete.  The reason you?d want to go back is to collect all the fruit, pellets, and tokens.  The tokens are what will really make you want to go back since they can be used to unlock games in the arcade, and even if you're just a minor Pac-man fan, the games are worth the trouble.  Included in all their original arcade glory are Pac-man, Ms. Pac-man, Pac-mania, and Pac-attack.  One more game is also included, Pac-man World 2 Maze which are the same type of levels you play when finding special Maze icons hidden throughout the levels.  T he'se are more or less the same old Pac-man game we all know and with a little bit of level design differences.  Actually, all the arcade games are at their core, Pac-man with the exception of Pac-attack which is more along the lines of Tetris.        The types of levels you'll find in the game are similar to Crash Bandicoot.  While the worlds are entirely 3D, you are still stuck on rails and forced to go the only way there is to go.  Another example of the game's Crash influence, are the levels where Pac-man is running towards the player, i.e. running into the screen to outrun an avalanche.  There are also ice skating levels (think the snowboard levels in Sonic), and even submarine levels.  A game with Mario's platforming, Sonic's charge move, and Crash's level design may seem like it would play awkward, but this hodge-podge of gaming styles actually works quite well.  You'll soon find yourself controlling Pac-man with ease due to the intuitive and tight controls.        One of the main problems with Pac-man World 2 is the camera.  While you can move it using the right analog stick, there is some limitation.  For example, when you move the camera somewhere an object lies, most games zoom the camera in on the back of the character, or make the object transparent.  Pac-man World 2 just makes the camera stop, as if it were hitting the object.  This can make for some truly odd camera angles that are less than ideal for the given situation.  Also, some areas have a fixed camera angle.  While many games give you the best angle when fixing the camera, many blind jumps are what you'll encounter in this game.  There are even some instances where you won't know where to go because the ledge you need to jump to is located towards the player.  This makes for some interesting situations.  Also, when fighting boss battles, the camera centers itself with the boss, not with you.  This constantly changes the orientation of your controls, which is the last thing you want when trying to battle a boss while jumping from platform to platform.    The other problem with Pac-man World 2 is the length.  This game can be completed by anyone who's played this type of game before in roughly five to seven hours, tops.  The ease of the game is the main contributing factor.  There are so many health power-ups and free lives located in the most convenient of spots.   If you are in an area that may take a couple of tries, there is almost always a free life waiting at the beginning so you can try as many times as you like without losing any men.  Sometimes you can find two free lives, and give yourself a huge amount of live by getting both lives, dying, and repeating.  The boss battles are also a cinch to complete.  The game will even tell you how to beat some of the bosses through the use of dialog between Pac-man and the boss.  Some of this dialog is quite informative, as I never knew Pinky had such a crush on Pac-man.  Do I sense a Pac-man love triangle?     GraphicsPac-man World 2 has a visual appeal to it that is hard not to like.  Sure, the models are incredibly basic, and the textures are simple at best, but they work.  We're talking about Pac-man folks, not Halo.  Bright colors and an almost utilitarian look make this game easy, not candy, for the eyes, though there are a few details that, while far from cutting-edge, help make the Pac-world seem a little more interesting.  The way Pac-man glows when eating a power pellet, how the water drips off Pac after stepping through a puddle, and the cold breath you see puffing from his mouth in the snow are just a few of things you'll notice when working your way through the levels.What I love most about the graphics are Pac-man's facial and body expressions.  When he tiptoes, Pac-man really looks like he's afraid to make any noise.  Some of his expressions are open to interpretation though.  While running or standing still, he has the largest open-mouth grin you're likely to ever see, though when walking, he'll produce a strange grin that makes you wonder if he?s feeling gay or depressed.  And his Peter Pan pose.  It looks so silly you can't help but smile.  SoundThe music in Pac-man World 2 is a lot like what you find in the Mario games - light-hearted and unobtrusive.  To have anything else in a Pac-man game might sound a little alien.  Thank God Namco didn't use any licensed music, or some generic dance-techno found in so many other games.  The spatial placement of sound is also done nicely and worthy of mention considering some games continue to supply us with what seem like mono soundtracks.  The sound effects are the real gem in this game.  Who can forget the sound of pellets being chomped?  Every true gamer should know this sound better than their own mother's voice.  Namco did well to keep the classic sounds in the game.  Even the spiraling sample used when Pac-man dies is used.  With the original Pac-man having anything but fancy visuals, the sound is what really created an anchor in my mind.  Hearing those tones again really does a nice job at creating a sense of nostalgia that many classic game updates fail to do.Pac-man World 2 is a fun and friendly game that has a great level of accessibility to it. The graphics and sound are standard fare, but the Pac-man license really adds to appeal.  Honestly, if the game were full of generic characters, the game would not be as fun.  But seeing and hearing the sights and sounds I grew up with pull a string in me that I just cant let go of.  And just look at Pac-mans smile.  How could you say no to a face like that.  The game follows just about every platforming convention, only with a Pac-man twist to it.  Pac-man world 2 is a great game for younger gamers, who are obviously the games target audience, but many older gamers can enjoy it as well.  Maybe even more so, considering many younger gamers dont even know who Pac-man is.  While not quite a fifty-dollar purchase, this game would be a great thirty-dollar or less title for fans of the Pac-man series, or for those who need a safe game to play after a round of Silent Hill, before going to sleep", "date": "Oct 10, 2002"}
