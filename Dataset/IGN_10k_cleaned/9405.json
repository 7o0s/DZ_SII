That said it's entirely open for debate as to just how many of the artists included on the game are truly legends in their field. The very same can be said of this 11 track audio companion to the game released by Interscope Records.   All things considered any self-respecting guitar heroaspiring, air, actual or otherwiseprobably already owns the bulk of the tunes included here. Not only that but while most times one yearns for such a short, sharp, and succinct album here an expanded offering (say double disc) would have entirely been warranted.    In terms of musical consistency, the album scores in that each song, regardless of being by different artists, flows together nicely, focusing on scathing and driving guitars for the most part. There's the seminal Smashing Pumpkins number ~Cherub Rock.~ Queens of the Stone Age clock in with ~3's and 7's.~ Velvet Revolver kick out the chugging ~Slither.~ A.F.I. deliver ~Miss Murder.~ Flyleaf serve up ~Tina.~ And Rise Against bring on ~Prayer of the Refugee.~   For those looking for a little flashback action then there's Sonic Youth's down-tempo sizzler ~Kool Thing~ (featuring the indefatigable Chuck D. from Public Enemy on guest vocals). Also Living Colour slip in their blistering hit ~Cult of Personality.~   Each of the aforementioned numbers are merely dj vu trappings. The real ~gems~ here are three ~exclusive~ tracks. The first is the lead off track, ~Guitar Hero 3 Intro.~ Composed and performed by former Guns N' Roses/current Velvet Revolver guitarist Slash, the track is the shortest number on the album (only 1-minute and 5-seconds). As can be expect Slash manages to pack a whole lotta guitar into the truncated length.     The other nuggets are the Nick Zinner Remix of Marilyn Manson's ~Putting Holes In Happiness,~ which while only 3-minutes and 43-seconds, feels much longer thanks to a twisted repeating guitar skirl that kicks out at the beginning and then worms its way in and out of the track.  Finally, there's ~Devil Went Down To Georgia [Guitar Hero Original]~ by Steve Ouimette. Suffice it to say that he turns the Charlie Daniels' classic flat out on its ass, taking the fiddle parts and rendering them in speed demon six-string scorchery. It's mondo excessive and awe dropping because (and in spite) of this.   As mentioned earlier there's really nothing new under the sun included here. It's basically a rehash of some of the key tracks featured on the game. The whole thing unfurls like a loosely concocted mix-tape made by somebody who doesn't feel the need to delve a little deeper into the mix. There's a few genuine moments of intensity (Velvet Revolver's ~Slither,~ for example) and a whole lot of just ho-hum inclusions, mostly due to the fact that we've heard these songs a million times before. A longer collection or the inclusion of more tweaked and/or remixed versions would have totally made this a must-have release. As it stands in it's current form it's just a fly-by-night offering that's by no means essential, either to rock purists or GHIII hardcore fans.
