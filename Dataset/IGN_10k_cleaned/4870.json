Co-developed in a joint venture by Red Entertainment and Taito to celebrate the latter's 50th anniversary, Bujingai is in so many ways, the sword-slashing extravaganza that Kunoichi was supposed to be; But while both of these titles are fast, good-looking, and heavy on the combat, Bujingai is less about the mindless Rambo-style annihilation of Forest Gumpian enemies, and more about capturing the deep duelist aspects of classic Hong Kong action films.   Starring the incredibly popular Japanese pop idol Gackt (often rumored to be the same inspiration for Final Fantasy VIII's Squall Leonheart), Bujingai takes players in the far off time that is the 22nd century and places them in the role of a badass swordsman named Lau Wong. Unfortunately for Lau, it appears that in the next hundred years or so there's a worldwide disaster that wipes out more than 70% of the world's population. And Lau's former best friend and training partner Rei Jenron is somehow at the center of it. Possessed by some kind of evil force, Rei has kidnapped the enchanted sprit of his deceased girlfriend Yohfa and opened a series of deadly portals overrun with demons. As you might have guessed by now, our hero Lau is the only man on the planet skilled enough to stop the vengeful Jenron from bringing about the apocalypse.   Though obviously entrenched in the same cookie cutter mold that powers just about every other action-oriented game and movie nowadays, Bujingai still manages to tell its tale pretty decently. Populated with bits and pieces of full motion video in-between the action parts in each of the game's seven stages, The Forsaken City does indeed have a specific narrative agenda. Though admittedly it's somewhat unclear for the entire first half of its events, by the time all is said and done, Bujingai's plotline should leave it viewers with at least some form of positive satisfaction. You can thank Geobreeders and Trigun scribe Yousuki Kuroda for coming aboard and managing that one.   Click for more images. Bujingai's release in Japan was a pretty big deal when it came out earlier last year as the game's heavy Hong Kong influence and strong development pedigree highlighted a very stylized and cinematic presentation. Similar in vibe to movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Butterfly Sword, and Warriors of Magic Mountain, The Forsaken City is just as operatically compelling as it is vigorous. Providing its hero Lau with a pair of deadly swords, some swiftly kicking feat, and the ability to create an amazing display of combinations, the game is just as much about watching the action as it is participating in it.   To keep things exciting and intuitive, the gameplay is pretty much broken down into four specific commands: jumping, spinning, attacking, and spell casting. And while any sequenced combination of the above can be chained together for some beautiful combat sequences, the fighting itself is never overly complicated. In fact, simply pressing the square button over and over again is more than enough to usually incapacitate your oncoming foes; while an occasional finisher via another button can put the closing touches on hairier situations. And after players get the hang of what could be the shortest learning curve in the history of PlayStation 2 action games, eliminating just about everything else in your path shouldn't be a problem -- at least, in the first two levels it won't be.    Once players make it to stage three, however, the challenge and enemy aggression really begins to heat up. Making the most of Lau's ability to block (done automatically when facing an opponent, but limited to a finite amount of hits based on your defense meter) and counter each enemy's attacks, the game really starts to come into its own after approximately three hours in. Regardless if you find yourself in combat situations against ordinary foes, mid-bosses, or end-bosses, things can get to be extremely difficult on the higher challenge settings -- and they'll really test your ability to uses reflexes and timing to your advantage.   When done correctly, Lau can find himself in some pretty spectacular fighting sequences; whether it's a series of rainbow colored sword clashes with one of the many Demon Lords or a spinning jousting match performed in mid-air, the cinematic presentation of Bujingai is definitely impressive. Using an experience system of sorts, the game will even allow you to purchase additional health, strength, magic, and defensive capabilities by collecting Onimusha-style orbs from fallen opponents (the upgrade system even works in a similar fashion to Onimusha thanks to the mirror-like gateway portals). As an added bonus, there are also a number of special hidden coins that can be used to unlock bonus features for later on in the game. So whether you're looking to uncover Gackt's real clothing as a costume alternative or a collection of DVD interview materials, the option to explore your surroundings is definitely encouraged.   Welcome as Bujingai's challenge and cinematic flair may be, however, its shallowness as an action title eventually begins to show. For starters, it's extremely difficult to cancel out of an attack combo once it has started because of the nature of the chain animations that are almost always initiated because of the setup of the combo system. It simply won't let you stop moving until its obligatory poses and slashes are completely over and done with. When fighting against enemies near ledges or against bosses that counter attack rather easily, this auto-animation issue can frequently cost you plenty of health in response to your enemy's reciprocal counterattacks or the bad luck of falling off into the deep dark pit below.

Additionally, the simplistic jumping and gliding puzzles (yes, you can glide around in the air with the secondary press of the jump button) are a lot easier than other games that employ similar kinds of obstacles (Prince of Persia we're looking your way), while the definite lack of enemy variety puts a damper on what could have been a more interesting rogues gallery. Also worth mentioning, are the mere seven levels provided; which never feels like enough despite the ability to go back and find additional secret coins on harder difficulty settings.   Luckily for publisher BAM! Entertainment, Bujingai makes up for a lot of simplistic gameplay with some truly pretty-looking visuals. Offering a series of distinctly different environments, The Forsaken City boasts everything from blizzard-ridden mountaintops and dusty desert castles to abandoned city streets and misty bamboo forests. Taking a cue from Otogi, Bujingai also offers a range of destructible environments; but unlike From Software's Xbox effort, that literally allows you destroy just about anything, Bujingai pretty much limits you to things like trees, crates, and mission-specific stones. It's too bad that Red didn't explore that aspect of the game a little further, as the Bamboo Forest stage proves that having a high amount of deformable items can be almost as much fun and fighting the enemies themselves.    The rest of Bujingai's visual presentation, however, is certainly top of the line. As not only does the framerate move at a silky smooth pace, but the textures, character designs, and pyrotechnic effects look pretty good too. For the most part, the flexible 3D camera works pretty strongly as well, but the less patient gamers out there may become a bit frustrated with having to stop and explore their surroundings for hidden bonus coins. Completists, on the other hand, probably won't mind the diversion very much at all.   Adding yet another layer to the game's strong cinematic feel is the solid soundtrack overseen by Katsuhisa Ishikawa (Darius Gaiden). Effectively combining a distinctly Asian fusion of traditional Chinese music with heavy metal, the music rarely gets repetitive and is definitely good enough to warrant importing the Japanese soundtrack. The games vocal support, while not as good as the original overseas version, is pretty decent too, and the high quality sound effects may not be high in number, but they get the job done.Veteran videogame players who have experienced previous titles like Otogi, Dynasty Warriors, Shinobi, and Crimson Sea probably won't find Bujingai to be too much different from what they've seen before. Overly simplistic and a bit formulaic, its unique approach to the genre isn't necessarily found in gameplay, but rather, it's style and presentation. Simply put, Bujingai has a great deal of personality to it, and in this day and age when hack and slashers are starting to bleed together into indistinguishable piles of silicon, personality can go a long way towards making up for mechanical shortcomings.But just because the game is short on the depth of its engine doesn't mean that it's short on the fun. Though it can get a little bit tedious and repetitive for the more demanding crowds out there, Bujingai still has a lot of entertainment value in it and shouldn't be so easily dismissed. As not only is it easy to pick up and get into, it also provides a great deal of enemy challenges in the higher difficulty settings; ones that are sure to test even the most elite of North America's most avid twitch gamers. Besides, when was the last time you played through an adventure using a sword wielding gender-neutral marital arts master anyway? Yeah, that's what we thought.", "date": "Jul 30, 2004"}
