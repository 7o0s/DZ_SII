With a plethora of months to learn the ins-and-outs of the excellent NFL 2K3 engine and the experiences they've attained over the last few years, the mighty developer/publisher team will certainly be a force to reckon with.   But that my friends, is next year, and in the interim I'm left with the review duties for the current edition: NCAA College Football 2K3. And while the finished product isn't a terrible game by any means, the high standard that was set by the office favorite and EA Sports creation, NCAA Football 2003 just can't be matched.   I think the primary problem lies is the fact that at its heart, NCAA 2K3 is a crippled version of last year's VC professional title, NFL 2K2. Whereas the EA game bleeds college attitude from every fiber of its being, the port-job in Sega's game feels a little less authentic. Yes it has a slew of familiar fight songs, realistic stadiums, and a mess of other bullet points that help to build a university atmosphere, but when those aspects are stacked into completion, there are still a number of unavoidable gaps that need to be filled.   Features  One of those gaps however, is not 2K3's list of features. Following its tradition of plenty of game options, players have all sorts of neat alternatives to the regular exhibition game. Homemade tournaments, single seasons, and the now-standard Legacy mode are yours for the taking. Naturally, the most interesting of these is the Legacy feature that allows you to follow your team over multiple years and send them to a possible 20 plus bowl games. While not as extensive or rewarding as EA Sports' version of the option, it's still a pleasant time waster.   A lesser version of the approaching NFL 2K3's franchise mode, I spent countless hours watching my players come and go, while trying to convince new high school recruits to join my side. If I was lucky enough to nab some of them, I had the option to divide training points among them and my remaining team members to create bigger and stronger athletes. Simple and menu-driven, the exercise proved to be one of my favorite aspects of the game, and is a feature alone that should move a lot of units. I just wish that there were some kind of incentive to continued success in the form of special unlockables and secrets.   Completists out there could find that the team statistics are a mixed bag. While each squad has over 50 players apiece on each of the 117 Division I-A teams, the Division 11-A representatives are few and far between (a department that EA Sports' college game has covered). Furthermore, not all of the teams have their specific fight songs, mascots, and other defining characteristics. Though they do have their specific stadiums modeled individually to match its real life counterpart. Not to mention the constantly updated National rankings which include separate polls from writers, coaches, and BCS standings. And finally, each team has had their rosters accurately evaluated by the experts at Collegefootballnews.com for complete authenticity. As college football fans know by now however, there are no actual player names per NCAA regulations (a quick visit to any popular sports website and the in-game player editor though, can fix that in a pinch).   Gameplay  Adding even further credibility to NCAA 2K3, is the fact that NFL 2K2 had already established itself as a great football game (hell, many of the editors here in the office felt that it gave Madden 2002 a thorough beating last year). And as expected the new college game follows in those footsteps quite nicely. Sporting the same bionic speed that last year's pro game offered in conjunction with the best running game in the business, using its engine for the college rev wasn't a bad move in the least. Ironically, it's NCAA'sstriking similarity to NFL 2K2 that keeps it from ascending to the proper echelon of college greatness.   To start, option plays aren't quite as prevalent as they should be, as it's the reliance on the option that sets collegiate-level and NFL squads most obviously apart. The second that you realize that you're only offered a handful of those types of plays before choosing the already seen pro-maneuvers of last year, is the same second you'll realize that the philosophy and excitement behind the whole letterman experience has been spoiled. And while the lack of options may not bother every college guy on the hunt out there, the lack of overall choices might seal the deal. As not only have the playbooks from NFL 2K2 been rearranged to appear more collegiate in nature (sans the O), they've been cut down considerably as well. Which ultimately translates into fewer possibilities on the football field.     Additionally, it doesn't appear that the dumbed-down A.I. from last year has been fixed in the least. Victims of some of the most asinine play calling in the league, the not-so bright CPU will still curiously decide to run the ball on a 4th and 17 in an attempt for a conversion. Not so strange in and of itself, but when you start to see it multiple times per season, you begin to wonder. Of course that means that even the most intermediate of players can trounce the computer after a couple of tries, and before all is said and done can demolish the competition without breaking a sweat (on all but the highest difficulty setting). Only then does it prove even moderately challenging.   Finally, I ran into a couple of strange bugs that happened on more than one occasion that left me scratching my head in puzzlement. The most fantastic of which centered on the Safety. Not the position, mind you, but the scoring type. Happening against both the CPU and another human player, I tackled the opposing team in their own in-zone while on second down, and didn't receive a safety. And if that wasn't peculiar enough, my opposition received their third down as if nothing had happened; scrimmaging right there, in the middle of their own in-zone.   Despite all of my grievances NCAA College Football 2K3 still manages to offer up a session or three of fun. Especially when paired against another human opponent. A true test of your gridiron mettle, successfully hiding your plays from your buddy by buffering your call and then adjusting your analog stick to a ringer play figures into an awful lot of strategy. And with the already offense-heavy tilt the game offers, you're looking at some wild affairs. This isn't a bad engine, it's just one that has been angled too sparingly towards the college game.   Graphics  Visually, NCAA 2K3 ranks up there with Electronic Arts own offering polygon for polygon. In fact, many of the player animations and motions are leaps above what that game has to offer. More fluid than Madden's younger counterpart, 2K3 makes for a more realistic session of football, or at least in terms of movement. Squint your eyes from a far enough distance and you'll swear that you're watching real people scamper all over the field. One-handed grabs, roof-raising celebrations, and big-play acknowledgments only begin to scratch the surface of what turns out to be a deep pocket of variation.   Curiously though, the game can often seem too dark for its own good. Overtaken perhaps by an over saturation of the color green and what seems like too many shadows, the silhouetted playfield acts as a stark contrast to the Madden series and its brethren. It's a stylistic choice yes, but one that doesn't do the college game as much justice as it does the pros.   But wait until you see the stadiums. Individually modeled for every team, the spot-on recreations are a graphical highlight to be sure. Already featured in a four-part series we debuted earlier last month, the eerily accurate arenas aren't the cookie cutter bowls that we're used too. Whether it's Texas El Paso's giant M-painted mountain or the no banner policy at Notre Dame, NCAA's authenticity is unmatched. You'll never look at the stadiums in other football games the same way again.   It's just too bad that the same attention to detail wasn't given to the players themselves: As their faces look like those of older, more experienced men. And though lineman and centers have been given much thinner bellies in comparison to their older NFL counterparts, it's hard to believe that an old wrinkled dude with a scowl is a first-year quarterback. Sure there are a couple of older folk in the universities now days, but the sheer amount of crust on the field this time is ridiculous.All in all, Visual Concepts has still managed to assemble a viable alternative for college football fans that can't get enough of the digital glory. A guaranteed good time for frequent renters and casual gridiron visitors who aren't as discerning as the die hard sports fans out there, NCAA College Football 2K3 isn't a bad choice.", "date": "Sep 24, 2002"}
