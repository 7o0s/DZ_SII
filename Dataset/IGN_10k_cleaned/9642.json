You might have heard of it. Hailed as the greatest online experience to ever hit the Internet in the history of forever, I eagerly locked away a weekend to take Master Chief online. Yet after spending a day of driving Warthogs and capturing flags on Xbox Live, it still hadn't lit the fire of fragging passion that I was expecting.    I brought this up with some Halo 3 devotees, and their reasoning behind my disappointment was simple. ~You just don't like sci-fi shooters with a fast pace and a need for twitch skills. You'd rather play more realistic shooters, where your tired, 31-year-old's nerves can handle the dawdling pace.~ Their sentiments seemed to ring true, as I realised that I've stuck exclusively to realistic shooters over the last couple of years.    After recently playing Unreal Tournament III (UT3), I've realised this reasoning is absolute garbage, and that they were just making excuses for a tired online game.   You couldn't find a game more removed from the realistic shooter genre if you sent it through a wormhole to the other side of the galaxy, where life-forms wage war with black hole bombs and giant laser-powered sand worms. Yet I absolutely adore UT3. It's the first new, old-school shooter since Quake III Arena, with a firm focus on faster-than-light combat, ridiculously cool weapons and a cast of characters, vehicles and levels that have been ripped straight from the pages of a schlocky sci-fi novel.     Watch our video review to see just how good this game looks.   In other words, it's the same Unreal Tournament that we've loved since the first UT was released last century. The original UT tore our PCs to shreds back in 1999 and since then we've had two other UT games, which actually makes this the fourth UT title. They've all stuck to the same formula, based around hyper-speed deathmatch action, but throwing in more goodies each time. This year sees the winning formula return, with a single major game mode addition, alongside a massive visual revamp designed to show us what the video cards of 2007 are capable of. While we usually encourage innovation in gameplay, by sticking to the older style of UT gameplay, UT3 actually feels new. Where all of its competitors have slowed down to focus on more realistic, tactical gameplay, UT3 has proudly snubbed this trend, and as a result feels unique.    UT has never been known for its strong singleplayer game, and sadly UT3 doesn't shake this trend. If you're looking for a deep and involving storyline, go play Half Life 2. However, if you'd like to train against competent bots to come to grips with the surprising depth and breadth of UT3's various modes and mechanics, the singleplayer game is a good place to start.   Between throwaway cut scenes telling a cardboard cut-out of a story, the singleplayer game slowly introduces you to the skills you'll need to avoid becoming a pile of bouncing gibs when you finally summon up the courage to go online. It eases you into deathmatch, then CTF, then the other game modes, as well as teaching you how to double jump and use the various vehicles and weapons. That's not to say it's very satisfying though, even with the awesome voice calls from your AI-controlled team mates. No matter how good today's AI is, and UT3 has some of the best we've seen, there's still no beating the cunning co-ordination of Homo sapiens. It's especially noticeable when vehicles enter the mix, as the AI struggles to not drive into walls or shoot in a straight line. Without a compelling storyline, the singleplayer ends up being a fairly sterile, though highly informative, extended tutorial.    The Necris are the bad guys, and look suitably creepy.  However, the singleplayer does include four player online co-op, so you can take on the bots with a few pals. I found it to be very laggy though, even when hosted on my 24Mbit/sec ADSL2+ connection. Hosting behind a NAT-enabled router was about as much fun as chewing on a three-round burst of UT rockets, although using the 1.1 beta patch finally enabled it to work. Yet even with Cam by my side, warping and teleporting as he was, it was still nowhere near as much fun as firing up a 1 vs 1 duel server, proving that UT3's real strength lies where it always has - multiplayer.     If you're looking for multiplayer variety, you've come to the right intergalactic battlezone. Got twenty minutes to kill between dinner and the latest episode of Heroes? Deathmatch is the perfect pre-meal appetiser, with jump in, jump out gameplay. In fact, an hour of deathmatch is the maximum you'll be able to handle, unless you want to risk a stroke from the excessive demands the game's scorchingly fast pace places on your nervous system. Duel is a nice twist on deathmatch, similar to the Rocket Arena mod of old - two players face off in head to head matches, while those waiting get to spectate.    If you'd like to combine the twitch-fest that is deathmatch with slightly more strategic gameplay, team deathmatch is the perfect recipe. The game's superb VOIP works a treat here, but it's in the deeper team-based games that it really proves its worth. Capture the flag is one such mode, but we doubt you'll bother with it once you've seen the mechanised fun that is Vehicle Capture The Flag. As you've probably guessed, this mode is just like vanilla CTF, but with the addition of vehicles. And it's the vehicles within UT3 that help to make it such a standout title.    Michael J Fox eat your heart out. Your hoverboard isn't half as cool as those in UT3.  If you're a fan of the hoverboard in Back to the Future 2, you'll love the hoverboards in UT3. Available only in the larger team-based games, these little rippers allow you to zip across the landscape at a speedy pace. The trade-off is that you can't shoot while boarding, and if you catch a bullet you'll stumble to the ground where you're momentarily stunned, making you easy pickings. To gain extra speed, you can even grapple on to friendly vehicles, giving you a nice speed boost. The translocator, a personal teleportation device, makes a welcome return, allowing you to flit across the playing area in a matter of seconds. If you're quick enough, you can even vaporise an opponent by teleporting into their position.    But the real fun is to be had behind the controls of the larger vehicles, which are split into two groups; the Axon and Necris. The Axon vehicles are based on those seen in the last UT title, although they've been tweaked considerably. There's the Manta, which has had a manoeuvrability boost, making it easier than ever to pancake your foes into the dust. The Raptor will take care of your air superiority needs, while the Scorpion buggy makes a welcome return, but this time its torso-cleaving blades are mounted on the front, making it easier than ever to dissect your enemy. There's also the Hellbender (an armoured jeep), the Cicada (ground pounding aircraft), Hellfire (artillery), Paladin (light tank), Goliath (heavy tank) and the granddaddy, the massive Leviathan, a battleship on wheels. There's plenty of variety there, but these all pale into comparison when you see what the bad guys get to play with   The Necris vehicles are without doubt the most original, terrifying, unique, horrible and creepy vehicles yet seen in a shooter. It's as if somebody at Epic suddenly realised ~hey, we're making a game, not real life - let's go freakin' crazy with our designs~.      The Viper is the least radical of these - it's a fast paced scout that doubles as a kamikaze device, great for towing friendly hoverboards to the front line. The Nemesis is a bizarre looking tank with tracks that can be deployed in various configurations; figuring out how to do so is still beyond me. The Fury is a flying vehicle that looks just like the Sentinel (or ~squiddies~) out of the Matrix, with flailing tentacles trailing behind it. For the sneaky types, the Nightshade allows full cloaking, making it great for recon runs, but my favourite vehicles are the remaining two.    Imagine a ball of glowing energy, around the same width as a man, moving across the battlefield on three long, robotic legs that move with the grace of an octopus. That's the Scavenger. It's got some really weird attacks which I have yet to figure out - one of them allows you to plough through people with all legs spinning, while another one has some kind of weird laser beam. While I had no idea how to use it, the fact that it looks so damn cool meant I couldn't help but jump in one if I saw it by the side of the road.   The DarkWalker. 'Nuff said.  But the most bad-ass vehicle in the game, and undoubtedly the coolest vehicle to yet feature in an online shooter, is the DarkWalker. In an unashamed nod to the recent War of the Worlds cinematic remake, it's a dead ringer for the giant alien tripods, although not quite as large. It even has the same laser attack as its movie-based inspiration, instantly gibbing any soldier foolish enough to stay in the way of the slow moving target reticule. The legs are perfectly animated, clawing across the landscape like some deranged three-legged spider. The first time you see a Darkwalker slowly stalking across the massive landscape will be a site that will stick in your gaming memory for years to come.   In all, there's a massive amount of variety in the vehicles, yet they all seem well balanced. If it's powerfully destructive, it's also slow and vulnerable. If it's fast and nimble, it's probably armed with a pea-shooter. And thanks to some commanding infantry weapons, a player on foot isn't necessarily an easy target.      These vehicles are all put to good use in the game's new mode, Warfare, which replaces the Assault mode of UT2004. The aim is to destroy the Power Node within your enemy's base, but to do this you must capture a set of nodes that link your base with theirs. It's only when you capture the last node that their Power Node becomes vulnerable. The result is a nitro-glycerine charged tug of war, keeping the battle focused in one area. However, other nodes often come into play - unlocking vehicle spawn points, lowering bridges, flooding areas and damaging the enemy core - so side battles over these points allow you to steer clear of the front line if you so desire. While capturing a node usually requires you to shoot the crap out of it before recharging it with your link gun, it's possible to grab a friendly orb from your base. Get this orb to a node and the node is instantly yours. This makes enemy orb runners a high value target.    Warfare is a truly great game mode, making up for the lacklustre Assault mode in UT2004. The maps are built perfectly to allow both infantry and vehicles to mix without favouring either type of player, and the nodes focus the fight into blazing points of battle. Sitting back and watching the struggle for a point, with massive DarkWalkers creeping towards the enemy base as barrages of plasma balls hurl through the air towards them, hoverboarders weaving through their legs, is an epic sci-fi sight to behold. It makes other recent sci-fi shooters look decidedly average.   Speaking of sights to behold, UT3 is pretty. Actually, that's like saying Jessica Alba isn't too shabby. UT3 is quite possibly the sexiest game on the PC, yet unlike Crysis, it runs at a decent clip. Warning - non-geekazoids might like to skip the next line. On my Vista powered Core2 Duo (overclocked to 3.3GHz), with 2GB of memory and a GeForce 8800GTX, it never dipped below a smooth framerate of 40fps with all settings maxed, at a high res and with antialiasing. While it doesn't make use of DirectX 10 (and why should it - we've yet to be convinced by any other DX10 games), it throws every trick in the graphics card book on to your screen. The result is an overdose of eye-candy that will leave your retinas throbbing. There's a slight issue with anti-aliasing though, requiring some tweaking of files, and AA might not even work on Windows XP (this has yet to be confirmed, but out-of-the-box there's no AA for anybody). It's not just the technology that is impressive; the art design behind the game is also impeccable. There's a massive variety of architecture in the game's huge number of levels, and each is tailored perfectly to its preferred mode of game play. Deathmatch maps favour tight and fast confines, while Warfare levels are large sprawling areas requiring the use of vehicles.    Yes, it really does look this good, but at a million miles per hour it's hard to notice all the intricacies.  Backing up the amazing visuals are sub-woofer shattering sound effects, along with the trademark UT announcements we all know and love. Hearing the announcer call out ~Killing Spree~ in his booming, godly voice hearkens back to earlier UT days, when life was simple, petrol was cheap and I didn't have more grey hair than George Clooney. The music isn't quite up to the same level as the other audio, but serious players will disable this anyway, allowing them to make use of the precise surround sound to hear when they're being stalked.    If there's one issue with the presentation of the game, it's the menu system. Pre-patch, it's dishearteningly simplistic, pointing to the fact that this game was also developed for consoles. For such a complex graphics engine, the video settings are pathetically basic, and the server browser is a dysfunctional mess. However, after installing the beta patch, things are looking much better, though the tweaking options are still very limited.   UT3 is a stunning return to form for this venerable series. By sticking to what it does best  fast, frenetic gameplay lavished with amazing visuals and a wealth of content  it stands out from the pack of realistic military shooters that are all the rage at the moment. The singleplayer is really just a tutorial, but the online experience is one of the shooter highlights of the year.", "date": "Nov 28, 2007"}
