And seeing that EA Sports has already released the market leader in the genre, Madden NFL 2002, and Sega is readying the release of the first in its successful franchise for PS2, NFL 2K2, one would think that it would be crazy to try and compete with these two big powerhouses.   Nonetheless, this situation didn't stop Acclaim from releasing its football game, NFL Quarterback Club 2002, and it hasn't stopped Konami from giving it a shot with the latest release in its series, ESPN NFL Prime Time 2002. And just like Acclaim was hoping that its license, the NFL Quarterback Club, would help it stand out from the rest of the pack, Konami seems to be banking on its ESPN license, which is pretty much synonymous with sports.   The duty of making a game that would fully take advantage of the ESPN license and hang with the big boys was left up to FarSight Studios, whose football resume includes games like NCAA '98 & '99 for the PC and NFL '95, Prime Time NFL Football, and NFL '98 for the Sega Genesis. FarSight Studios might have been out of the game for a while, but the company, with the help of Konami, has managed to craft a title that not only has made good use out of the ESPN-license, but also has a feature set that rivals that of longer-running franchises.   It is still by no means a Madden or 2K2-killer and has a significant number of problems that need to be addressed, but ESPN NFL Prime Time 2002 is a noble effort that deserves some props for doing some things really well.   Features Before we get to all of the reasons that you probably shouldn't buy this game, let's get this started with a look at the area where the developers did a really good job with -- the feature set. Prime Time 2002 doesn't quite match Madden 2002's deep feature set, but it comes pretty close. Plus, it actually has a few things that I'd like to see in the next Madden, but we're getting ahead of ourselves.   In addition to the basic play modes, exhibition, practice, etc., this game offers a nice situation setup mode that lets you customize the game to put yourself in classic situations. Sadly, it only allows for full customization and doesn't have any default situations, which would have been immensely cooler. What's more, Prime Time 2002 puts forth a fairly deep Franchise mode, which is kind of shocking considering that you usually won't see something this deep in a relatively new game.  The Franchise mode lets you go at it with any team, which you can change at any point in the season or off-season, and lets you play through a pre-season, the regular season, the playoffs, the Super Bowl, the Pro Bowl, and the tremendously fun off-season. And if you're not happy with your team's players, you can always start it off with a Fantasy Draft and build your team to your liking.   What's really cool about the pre-season setup here is that you're given an extra option for roster management called Playing Time. Just like is the case in the real deal, you can setup your pre-season rosters so that you have players setup to play for each particular quarter. So, you can set it up so that your best QB only plays the first quarter, your number two guy start in the second and third and your third string QB go at it in the fourth.   With any of the games, whether pre-season, regular-season or the post-season, you can obviously play your team's game or let the computer simulate it. And if you choose to simulate the game, you actually have a lot of control over how the team plays the game in the simulated contest. You can adjust sliders for things like conservativeness or aggressiveness of the offense, the run/pass balance, the blitz frequency, and the frequency of running zone defenses verses tight man coverage.   Even cooler, you can set-up match-ups, so if you're going against a mobile QB that's a threat to run, you can have a spy set to watch him. Plus, there are options to single cover, double cover or provide safety help for each particular wide receiver. And for the running back, there are options to handle things normally, put an 8-man front up against him, or provide heavy run support. It obviously doesn't do much for the gameplay, but it's nice to know that you have a little more control over what happens in the simulation.  Prime Time 2002 also has some fairly deep roster management features for the Franchise. It not only has the obvious stuff, such as releasing players, doing trades (with draft picks in the off-season), editing players (change appearance and numbers), and signing free agents, but it also has some nice stuff that's not quite the norm just yet. These include the ability to put players on the trading blocks and the ability to receiver computer offered trades.   The stat tracking is pretty deep, as well, but it could use some changes. Every important stat is kept for the major offensive and defensive categories, as well as league leaders and team stats, but the menus to navigate these stats could've been a little better. When looking at these numbers you can only see the total for each stat at one time, so when you're looking at the QB pass rating, that's all that you get to see. You do get to see some key stats for the highlighted player on the side bar, but it wouldn't been nicer to have more of it on screen.   Still, the stat tracking is fairly deep and keeps track of career records during the franchise, which is made extra cool by the fact that you can actually beat career records in the game, in addition to real single-game and single-season records. So, if you're up to it, you can replace Jerry Rice's name in the record books for things like receptions, reception yardage and the like. You can also break Dan Marino's various career passing marks and Reggie White's career sack total, but you won't replace their names as much as their team and uniform number, because Konami must've been unable to get the license to their names.  And as great as all of this stuff is, some of the best features in Prime Time are in its off-season. After each year in a franchise, you get to go through the basic stuff -- re-sign players, sign free agents, see retired players, and the rookie draft. But what's great about it is that the rookie draft has some awesome features that make it even more entertaining that it normally is.   First, you get a cool draft ticker which puts a time limit on making picks, and the scouting you have for each player includes attributes like 40 time, bench press, squat and other numbers that would be similar to what you'd get from the NFL combine, instead of the same basic attributes that you have for your current players. It's small stuff, but it's something that makes it feel more like you're participating in the real thing and that's what I'm looking for in my football games.   Gameplay The problem with Prime Time 2002 is that while it has lots of all the cool little things that help make a good football game great, it seriously lacking in the most important aspect of any football game -- the gameplay. It is pretty fun to play at times, because of its fast-pace and almost arcade-like qualities, but it's ultimately unrewarding because it just does too many things wrong.  The passing game, for one, feels completely random at times. It's sometimes difficult to tell if a player has caught the ball or not at times and the majority of receptions seem to be ~jump balls~ where both the receiver and defensive back both stop in the same place and jump up for the ball. And in these situations it doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to who will come down with it.   You will also see a lot of weird things happen in the passing game. Receivers will constantly get bumped around downfield on long routes and when throwing a pass to the sideline, the receiver will come to a complete stop about five yards away from the sideline, run in place for a little while, and then go after the ball when it comes. It's obvious that this was done to handle the problem of receivers just running out of bounds on pass patterns, but this was NOT the best way to handle it. It just looks stupid and completely unrealistic.  Another problem is that the difficulty in the passing game as you progress from Rookie, to Pro, to All-Pro and eventually to Hall of Fame, seems to only center on whether or not passes are caught. The only thing that makes passing harder to do on Hall of Fame versus the easier settings is that your receivers will drop more passes. Coverage isn't necessarily that much better, your guys just develop rocks for hands. This can probably be best seen by making use of some of the biggest money plays -- just about any flat or swing pass to a back (Warrick Dunn -- 320 catches for 5,291 yards on All-Pro). It works for excellent and consistent yardage on every difficulty level, with the effectiveness being more if you have a good back, but you'll find that the back will drop the ball more as you beef up the difficulty setting. So, instead of making the defense cover the play better, the game just makes your RB drop it more in order to make the game harder. That's, obviously, not a good thing.  Running the ball is a little more entertaining, but the running game also has its fair share of problems. First and foremost, the line-play in the game is horrible. There's no movement at all with players that are locked in a block and it seems that that the only available scenarios are for either the defensive lineman or offensive lineman to fall down, which is pretty unrealistic.   And this also seems completely tied to the difficulty level, so if even if you have a player like Warren Sapp when you're playing defense, he'll get knocked down a lot when trying to take on an offensive tackle. Similarly, if you play on anything below Hall of Fame, you can use a player like Sapp to completely dominate the offensive line since he'll automatically knock down the first offensive lineman trying to block him, allowing him to get into the backfield in every single play. In a full season with Tampa Bay on All-Pro, I was able to net an astonishing 98 sacks.    This poor line play hurts the running game because it's hard to read holes. Since there's really no movement between the players, it's hard to tell who's winning the battle. So, you might see a hole, but as you're running through it both of your offensive lineman might just ~fall down~, thus allowing the defenders to crack down on you. Plus, whether or not you can break a tackle with one of your special moves, whether a stiff-arm, spin, or juke, again seems completely geared towards the difficulty setting.   It's also easy to get stuck on other players, especially when trying to make it through a smaller hole in the middle of the line. This has been a problem of the majority of football games, including Madden, but it's worse here the most others that have been released in recent times.  Another problem, which can be equated with both the passing and running games, is the way that the QB rolls around in the pocket. He simply rolls out way too fast and unrealistically. And because of this, you can take a player like Michael Vick and rush for 100 yards per game on Rookie, Pro and All-Pro, with Hall of Fame being the only one posing any problems.  And even on Hall of Fame, you can make the Goaline QB Sneak where you run a sweep with the Vick a money play by turning off the Fatigue, which seems to only affect the speed of the player with the ball doing a speed burst. You can seemingly run a player to death, but he doesn't seem to tire that much as a game progresses, as it seems to me that Fatigue only pertains to the speed burst length of the guy with the ball. So, if you turn it off, you can run pretty much outrun the defense on every play, as having it on simply allows the defenders to catch up to you.   There are various gameplay sliders that affect the speed of the game, the speed of the passing game, tackling, catching, blocking, and so on, but tweaking them only patches some holes and doesn't really improve on the game's biggest problems. The AI, as has been discussed in part, seems to only affect the frequency of things like dropped passes, broken tackles, and so on, and nothing more. The CPU teams don't call better plays and they don't position themselves better, or anything like that. As the game gets harder, you guys will simply drop more balls, your lineman will lose more one-on-one blocks, and it'll be harder to break tackles.   Similarly, the AI play calling can also be unrealistic. Even on the Hall of Fame setting, where they can actually get some big runs off on you, the CPU seems to pass about 80% of the time. And it doesn't always handle situations correctly. The CPU will actually catch punts in the end zone, which rarely happens in the NFL because players are schooled to let it go if it's within the 10 yard line, and will always try to run it out. So, instead of trying to punt the ball to the sidelines, to get them inside their five, your best bet is to just punt it deep in the end zone and tackle the return man when he comes out of it. I was able to do this about four or five times while playing the game (would've been more, but who really punts when you're that close?).  The problems don't end there, either. Prime Time 2002's problems also extend to the kicking game. First, with punting and kicking field goals, extra points or kickoffs, it's just far too easy. Even if you have a poor kicker, you can expect to make all of your 50-yard FG attempts as long as the wind isn't going against you. Plus, when returning kick-offs, the blockers don't really move like they should and will do stupid things like run in a group to the left on a wedge where they should worry about the guys coming straight down at your kick-returner.   It's also worth noting that there aren't any left-handed or left-footed players in the game. So, quarterbacks like Michael Vick and Mark Brunell will pass the ball right-handed and kickers like Janikowski will kick the ball with their right foot.   All that said Prime Time 2002 does actually have some cool things to offer in the gameplay department. Most notably, the play-calling menu is very slick and easy to quickly navigate. You can quickly change formations by pressing left or right, but instead of having to hit a button to select it -- the plays are already on screen, allowing you to press up or down to scroll through them. It's a little thing, but it takes away a button press, which makes it a little more fluid. You can also change the sets by pressing the L1 or R1 buttons and pull up advanced play calling menus, which allow you to select things like zone or blitz defenses on defense and run middle or high risk on offense, by pressing the R2 button at the play call screen to toggle it on and off.   The only thing missing is that it doesn't appear to have a memory option where it remembers the last play you've called or formation that you've selected, so you always start back at the first one when it comes time to select a play.   Additionally, the playbook is exactly the same for every single team in the game, with the only exception being that some teams have a West Coast formation and others do not, so you're not going to get plays that are even close to being specific for your team.   Even with all of these problems, I managed to enjoy NFL Prime Time 2002 a bit, at least partially. You might be able to, as well, but only if you're able to live with all of its gameplay problems, as the thing that makes it fun is its features and not its gameplay.   Graphics The graphics, at least initially, will appear to be pretty sub-standard. The player models are oddly shaped. They seem to have an overly arched back, hold their arms in a weird way and have a strange way of walking to the line after they break out of a huddle.   However, the more that you play the game, the more you'll notice the extra visual details that make this a better than average looking game. The helmets, for instance, look amazing. They look very smooth and the lighting and reflections on them look just like they do on close-ups on the old television. Likewise, the helmets will get scuffed up more and more as the game progresses and there are a variety of scuffs that you'll see.   The same things happen with the jerseys. While they don't look that amazingly detailed, they show nice wear as the game progresses, especially during bad weather games. By the end of a game in the rain, the players' uniforms will really look like they've been through a real bad weather football game.   The only problem with it all is that it's not real-time and not based on what's happening in the game, as all the players seem to have the exact same wear on their helmets and uniforms regardless of position and whether or not they've played the whole game. So, if you sub in a new QB in the fourth quarter of a game in the rain, his uniform will be as dirty as that of the starter.   There are also some nice sideline details, at least in the in game cut scenes. During gameplay, the sidelines are filled with flat models, but for cut scenes, you'll see fully polygonal coaches, players, cheerleaders and even the guy holding the parabolic microphone.   The player animation is pretty limited, but the stuff that's been animated well looks really good. Some of the wrap-ups on tackles look almost life-like, but there's not a lot of variety in the tackles and they seem a bit scripted. What this means that is you can be in the middle of a spin move, but if the guy gets tackled, the tackle itself will look exactly like it would have if you weren't in the middle of a spin. Likewise, there aren't any animations for line-play, as they just lock-up until one of the players falls down.   And while the game runs smoothly for the most part, there are some times that you'll encounter some massive slowdown. It'll happen on some run plays in the middle, but in one particular case, it slowed down every time I broke the huddle in a Super Bowl game.   It's obviously not in the same league as Madden 2002 or NFL 2K2 graphically, but it's not all that bad, either. You're not going to feel the power of PS2 here, but the visuals are definitely above average.  Sound Just like is the case with most of the other aspects of the game, I have a sort of love/hate relationship with Prime Time 2002's audio. On the love side, I'm a huge fan of Chris Berman, so getting to hear some of his well-known phrases during the game definitely appeals to me. In fact, on long run or pass plays, you might get treated to his now famous ~he...could...go...all...the...way...TOUCHDOWN!~   Sadly, though, the majority of the commentary is on the boring side. The majority of the lines delivered by both Chris Berman and Tom Jackson are poorly presented, don't mesh well together and sound pretty monotonous. And while they do have some player specific things to say, you'll hear each comment at least four or five times over the course of the same game. Likewise, some phrases, such as Berman's, ~he was covered by the proverbial blanket,~ will be heard way too many times during a single football game.  There is some nice music that'll play after some touchdowns and the fact that the intro and menus has theme music from the NFL Prime Time television show is a plus, but the non-commentary sound is pretty substandard on the whole, as well. The crowd noise is nothing more than a constant cheer and it doesn't seem to change much depending on where the game's being played or how important the game is.   If you want to get into the huddle and Under the Helmet of real NFL football, head over to NFL.com. With live chats, real-time audio and interactive polls, you can experience NFL action like never before.Did I have fun playing ESPN NFL Prime Time 2002? Believe it or not, I actually did. But, you could probably put just about any football videogame in my hands and I'll find a way to have some fun with it. Prime Time made it even easier by appealing to my love of the little extras that don't seem like much to casual football fans but give people like me that live for the sport a warm, fuzzy feeling in my heart.What I'm talking about is things like a deep franchise mode, the ability to break career statistical records, a draft ticker during the rookie draft, ability do to a fantasy draft before the start of a franchise and lots of nice statistical overlays during the games. Yes, gameplay is what's most important, but that should be a given. It's the little details that help making the virtual football gaming experience a little more like watching it on TV, seeing it live of actually playing it, that will separate the champs from the chumps.Unfortunately, the gameplay, which seems like it should be a given seeing that football videogames have been around for about as long as gaming, just isn't all that good. If you want a more detailed list of what's wrong, you can go back and re-read what I wrote in the ~Gameplay~ section above, but for those looking for a basic summary of what's wrong, here's the gist of it -- it just doesn't play enough like real football.The passing game is filled with flaws and it's often hard to tell if a ball is caught or not. The running game is hampered by poor line-work, bad collision detection and the worst case of ~Mario Running~ that I've seen in a football game in quite some time. And the computer-controlled teams and players just do too many things that you wouldn't see in a real NFL game. It's kind of sad, though, because there are honestly a lot of things to like about this football game. But, as is, ESPN NFL Prime Time 2002 isn't a game that I'd recommend for a purchase. There are other football games out on the market that have as many great features, in some cases even more, and back it up with much better gameplay. So, unless you're one of those kinds of sports gamers that must buy each and every single football game released for the system you own, don't pick this up.", "date": "Nov 20, 2001"}
