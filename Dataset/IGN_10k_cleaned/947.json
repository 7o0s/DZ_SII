{"name": "Vagrant Story", "name_review": "Vagrant Story", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/05/23/vagrant-story", "text": "Looking at the games that the company has already released, and adding to that the strong lineup of upcoming titles that will be unleashed on American gamers on a monthly basis throughout this summer and fall, this is undoubtedly Square EA's year. No other game company, including Sega and Nintendo, has a software lineup that includes this much quality.   The biggest case in point is that Vagrant Story is generally overshadowed by Square's other titles such as Final Fantasy IX, Chrono Cross, Legend of Mana, and Parasite Eve II, when it's arguably one of the best games on PlayStation.   Under the fine direction of Yasumi Matsuno, the game has a storyline and presentation that are equal to that of Hideo Kojima's cinematic masterpiece, Metal Gear Solid. In fact, the five-minute long opening sequence to the game is one of the best one will ever encounter in a videogame and will pull the player deeply into the storyline as well as any opening to a big budget Hollywood action flick.   Truth be told, the actual storyline of the game plays out much better than most of today's big blockbuster films. Set in Medieval times, the game's story revolves around Riskbreaker Ashley Riot, who is a member of the Valendia Knights of the Peace (VKP).   The manor of Duke Bardorba of Valendia Kingdom had been seized by a cult of religious zealots lead by Sydney Losstarot, while the Duke was away. And Ashley is sent in by the VKP to break the cultists' hold on the manor. Throughout the game, players will find out more about Ashley Riot and his mysterious past, and will be introduced to many other secondary figures who play a significant role in the game, such as Romeo Guildenstern, the leader of the ~Crimson Blades,~ Callo Merlose, a VKP Information Analysis, and John Hardin, who is a prominent member of the Mullenkamp Cult.    Whilst the background story by itself is already more intriguing than what you'll encounter in many of today's games, what makes the entire storyline stand head and toes above the rest is how it plays out as players progress through the game. Vagrant Story is filled with an enormous amount of mystery and intrigue and has some amazing twists and turns that are almost as big as the plot twists in recent films The Sixth Sense and Fight Club.   In spite of the occasional typo or grammatical hiccup, the overall writing quality of the game is good. This really means a lot because of all the writing styles to try and carry out, the ~Medieval-speak~ that Vagrant Story uses is probably the most difficult to do. The commendable writing effort, brilliant storyline and masterful cinematic presentation all really add up to one of the best gaming experiences that you can get on PlayStation.   Gameplay After a compelling storyline, the most important thing that most role-playing fans look for in their RPGs is a quality battle system. While it's not quite action-oriented enough to be called an action/RPG and it is more hands-on than most traditional style RPGs, the battle system in Vagrant Story is so deep and intuitive that it'll likely please fans of either RPG genres.   The key word when describing the battle system in Vagrant Story is deep. It's by far the most in-depth system that has ever been implemented in a console role-playing game. Yet, at the same time, it doesn't feel the least bit overly complicated or too robust. At least, after you've played the game for a few hours.   There are just so many different factors that come into play during the battles in the game. First, the battle system enables the player to target specific body parts of the enemy, which vary from enemy to enemy, and enemies can also do the same with attacking Ashley. In this area alone the depth is staggering, as there's an enormous amount of technique that can be used in choosing which areas to attack and it all depends on the specific monsters that you're attacking. Targeting specific areas can render certain parts of the enemy's body useless and that in turn effects how you can fight it.   What's more, the game's battle system also makes use of things such as Risk Points, Battle Abilities, Character Class, and Character Affinities, all of which play major roles in the player's encounters with enemy creatures.   Risk Points are basically a measure of Ashley's combat abilities with ~Risk Zero~ meaning that he is completely calm and in control of the situation. The Risk increases as he does battle and it makes him less effective at either fighting or defending. Performing special moves can make the Risk Points climb even faster, so it's very important to manage your attacks effectively.   The game's battle abilities include Chain Abilities and Defense Abilities. The Chains let you string together combination attacks that are tied to the Square, Triangle, and Circle buttons. It not only enables you to do consecutive attacks by pressing the button as contact is made with the enemy, but special abilities can be tied to the buttons which can cause more damage or help out the player in other ways.   Chaining does increase the Risk Points a lot faster than single attacks, but the reward can be well worth the risk. However, because of the Risk Points, players have to use the chains intelligently and can't just continually perform them. The Defense Abilities also play a major role as in some cases the only way you'll be able to beat certain bosses is if you effectively use them.   The most important thing to consider when going into battle is the Class and Affinity of the enemies that you're about to encounter and the weapons you're using. Whether your weapon is good against the specific class or affinity of the enemy, the way you approach the fight plays an enormous role in how easy or difficult the battle could be. The difference is really staggering as your choice of weapons and battle techniques will determine whether you're able to dismiss of boss in just a few hits or a two to three hundred.   Because of this, it's extremely important to manage your weapons effectively. Using a particular weapon against a certain class of creature will make it stronger against it. However, players don't have to be tied to a weaker weapon found earlier in the game just because it has been powered up against certain classes, as the game enables you to combine different weapons and armor to make new ones -- some of which are more powerful and others that are less.   So, you can have a blade that you've used against dragons that you combine with another one to make a brand new more powerful weapon that not only does more damage in general but also retains the strength against the dragons. The combinations seem endless. Players will be able to spend days just trying to find the best combinations to make the finest weapons imaginable.    The phenomenal battle and item systems (which also include magical attacks, Break Arts, and much more) would all be for naught if the experience was tedious and proved uneventful. This is definitely not the case with Vagrant Story as it just adds to the game's value.   Furthermore, the game's value is even greater considering that this isn't a short little adventure. Contrary to previous reports, Vagrant Story isn't a mere five to seven hour game (though, you can probably make it through the game your second time through completely powered up). Assuming you're not cheating (cheat codes, Game Sharks, strategy guides), the game will probably take you more than 30 hours to complete.   And what's more, the game has been specifically designed to be played through more than once as it has optional dungeons, bosses, and items that can only be found when playing through the game for the second time. There's just an amazing amount of replay value here.   The only real flaw that this game has it that there are some issues with the balance of the enemy creatures. Even with the correct affinity- and class-based weapons and armors equipped, some of the normal enemy encounters prove to be more difficult than many of the boss battles. While these creatures can be much more easily dispatched than the bosses, some are blessed with some powerful spells that can kill your well-healed character in a single shot if you're not careful.   This is made worse by the fact that you're limited to saving games at the save points. The game is set up in a way that if you wish to save after each boss encounter, you'll probably have to do a lot of backtracking. So, if there were more save points and a better balanced set of characters, this legendary game would probably be just about perfect.   In an era of cookie cutter games in which the license means more than gameplay in the eyes of many execs, it's inspiring to see a battle system that's so innovative and a game that seems so well conceived. Kudos should be given out to the creators of this stunning masterpiece.    Graphics  While most of the game's colors seem to be just variants of brown, don't let it fool you -- Vagrant Story is one of the most visually stunning games on PlayStation. The overall texture quality of the characters and backgrounds are just amazing and it's all topped off with brilliant character designs, created by the talented Akihiko Yoshida.   In fact, this is one of the few cases where the in-game polygonal models of the characters and monsters are on par with the artist's conceptual work. To top it all off, the excellent character models and designs are matched by the outstanding animation. Ashley moves around the detailed environments in a very realistic manner and he's loaded with tons of different animation for his various attacks.   The creators of Vagrant Story also deserve another pat on the back for their work on the boss characters. When players encounter the different bosses that include Dragons, Golems, Minotaurs, Demons, and the like, they'll undoubtedly be impressed by the raw size and magnificence of these colossal beasts.   The visual tour de force continues with the excellent background and ambient special effects. The game's lighting must be seen to be believed and certain effects like the rain are some of the best you can get on PlayStation.   Sound Let's face it. While it doesn't typically get the credit that it deserves, audio is one of the most important aspects of any videogame. Just as in the case with movies, the musical soundtrack and sound effects can do wonders in pulling those emotional strings in each and every one of us. If you think about it, movies like Titanic, Star Wars, Braveheart, and Shawshank Redemption wouldn't have been as inspiring as they were if not for their brilliant musical scores.   When done right, audio can pull the player into the game's storyline so tightly that players will feel the true emotions that the designers wanted to inspire. This is definitely the case with Vagrant Story. Squaresoft has done a masterful job with both the game's musical score and sound effects. The soundtrack sets the mood of each scene perfectly and helps bring out emotions like fear, intrigue, happiness, love and hate.   The brilliance extends with the game's sound effects. Everything from the sounds of the player's footsteps, to the ambient background noises, and to the grunts and groans of monsters in the area, just pulls the player deeply into Vagrant Story's magnificent world. It honestly doesn't get much better than this.  Ever since Square in Japan first announced Vagrant Story, I've been eagerly anticipating it. Everything about the game, from the artwork to the storyline, just seemed golden. And when the game's first playable demo was released, it just fueled my desire to have this title even more. The problem with wanting a game, or anything in life for that matter, so much is that it can lead to disappointment if it doesn't truly live up to your lofty expectations. Vagrant Story does not fall into this predicament, as it has met or surpassed all of my expectations. Not only is the game's story one of the best you'll find in a videogame, but it also rivals many of today's films. The game's goodness doesn't stop there as Vagrant Story is also blessed with a tremendously deep battle system, beautiful in-game graphics, and an engrossing musical soundtrack. Simply put, Vagrant Story is a true work of art and is one of the most cinematic experiences you'll find on PlayStation. It's not only one of this year's best games -- it's one of the greatest of all-time.", "date": "May 23, 2000"}
