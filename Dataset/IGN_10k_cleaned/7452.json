The latest adventure starring a team of tiny bots, Tokobot Plus: Mysteries of the Karakuri has everything fans of the original could want. Of course, it may have a little too much, since Plus actually cannibalizes much of the PSP adventure.  It adds a few things and tweaks some others, usually to good effect. Those who spent time with the original will definitely notice the interface improvements, which actually help combat and overall puzzle exploration flow better. Take a little more time and plenty of new stuff makes its way to the surface, such as new story elements and secret labyrinths. This adds a good amount of value to the previous adventure, though it fails to make an overly impressive package. Instead, it makes it feel as though this new product should have been the one that shipped on the PSP in the first place. Still, it's an improvement, though not as exciting as it would have been the first time around.    And just for the sake of clarity, many of the elements between the PSP and PS2 versions of Tokobot are identical. This includes level and character design, even the puzzles and obstacles themselves. As such, this preview will reiterate points made in previous articles. With this in mind, head down and read all about it. Each of the game's original stages makes a comeback and you play though them in the same order. You still need to contend with the same enemies for the most part, and most of the puzzles throughout the entire game remain unchanged. As far as visuals go, the two versions look close. The PS2 iteration pulls ahead thanks to smoother animation and slighter better textures, but for the most part the differences seem minor.  Before jumping into what's new, here's a recap on story from the PSP version since the two are identical: The world you inhabit is called Moritari. Apparently, an advanced civilization once lived there. With the help of a device known as the Eternal Engine, the people of this civilization lived in perfect harmony with nature, themselves and the universe. Everything was, in a pair of words, truly groovy. But then things grew very un-groovy and the ancient, ridiculously-advanced civilization slipped into oblivion. With nothing to replace the Eternal Engine, the world of Moritari grew into a dark, lonely place.   Thousands of years passed before a new civilization sprung up. The people of this new society started copying the technological advances from the old society and formed a breed of robots called Karakuri. These robots did the usual synthetic human-thing, meaning they helped their masters accomplish a myriad of tasks. In addition to the Karakuri, the new society created a series of archeological institutes to study all the old stuff scattered throughout Moritari. The goal, of course, to find a breakthrough like the Eternal Engine.  Now for all the new stuff. Developers wanted to fix the nagging camera problems that plagued many of the levels in the original Tokobot. They only partially succeeded. While the game does offer you better camera control, it invariably becomes stuck behind walls and pillars. This happens constantly when standing next to a structure, regardless of size, and you re-center the camera. It actually swings behind your character and then spazzes out because of the building (or whatever else) right next to you.        As noted before, the interface also benefits from a little tweaking. Fans may remember, and developers readily admit, that changing Tokobot formations messed with the flow of the game. The new process works a lot smoother. Changing Tokobot formations only takes one button now. You still need to ~prime~ their abilities by holding down the R1, then tap the appropriate face button, but it works better.   Every combination corresponds with a particular face button on the PS2 controller, too, so it's a simple matter of pressing the right button to get the Karakuri to change formation. As for the actual transformations themselves, they all play out smoother than in the original. It's a subtle improvement, sure, but it helps improve the overall pacing of the game, especially where it counts - solving puzzles and defeating enemies. And that's really the source of Plus's greatest strength and weakness. On the one hand, solving the environmental puzzles is a better experience here, and the same goes for combat. By the same token, you've already seen these puzzles before and you've already smashed these enemies, limiting the appeal, with or without improvements.    Certain sections merit a little notice, though. Take the treasure stages, for instance -- they're a completely new addition that actually make the game longer. Each level has these treasure stages, which you need to uncover by scouring the game's environment. They're pretty well hidden, too, so anyone who likes sniffing around for extras will get a kick out of that. When you actually do find one, you'll need to navigate a series of fast-moving deathtraps to reach a reward at the end of the stage. They're almost like ancient crypts rigged with traps, only here, they make use of all the crazy abilities the game gives you. They're fun for the most part, though some of the later ones can get pretty aggravating due to their difficulty.   Also new are the overdrive techniques. These special moves appear after you've beaten boss characters and they're a pretty nice addition. They actually help change how you play the game somewhat, since each overdrive attack has a unique strength. You can also upgrade each one several times by visiting a laboratory in-between missions. The number of enemies each technique can affect increases every time you upgrade them, so it's a worthwhile investment. Plus, each version looks radically different, so there's an aesthetic bonus as well.   While an improvement over the original, Tokobot Plus: Mysteries of the Karakuri still has a few remaining issues. The added overdrive techniques, narrative enhancements and treasure stages all help, but the camera needs work and so does the control. Not only that, it looks a little dated on the PS2. Still, it's a fairly decent ride for those who never tried the original PSP title.", "date": "Oct 26, 2006"}
