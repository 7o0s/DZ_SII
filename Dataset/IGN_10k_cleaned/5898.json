In some ways it works wonderfully and is a brilliant tool for those who want to bring their own creativity and bizarre senses of humor into a game. But when it comes to the actual experience that the game provides it can also fail in some fantastic ways. This all leads to a game that is a strong contender for cult status by those who will undoubtedly spend several hours creating their own creatures and leave everyone else scratching their heads.   The story and general action of Graffiti Kingdom is about as simple as it comes with basic platforming elements done in a rather low-budget way. The graphics are far closer to that of Katamari Damacy than many of the titles that are currently pushing the limits of the PS2. But unlike Katamari Damacy, the action in Graffiti Kingdom is not interesting enough to make one look past the simple graphics. The environments are incredibly simple and are populated with an odd assortment of enemies that are easily taken out.   Within the game, the big challenges are figuring out where to go, beating up lots of scrubs, and fighting boss battles. But these boss fights are not just difficult because of the strength of the bosses (definitely a factor), but also because the camera easily freaks out in the confined spaces that the bosses inhabit. Within a fight it's easy to lose track of not only where the boss is, but also where the controlled creature is. With lots of repetitive action and other awkwardness there is little to recommend in the basic playing of the game. That is, unless you're a big fan of exploring lots of rooms and punching critters.   So then the big question is, ~What the hell is going on?~ Why would anyone bother playing such a game that by all rights should have been left by the side of the videogame highway as all of its brethren had long since evolved and moved on? Well, it's all about the character creation. The main character here is a prince who looks and talks like a girl who has accidentally unleashed a great terror upon the land and it's up to him to save everyone. On his own he can't do any attacks and so he needs to create other creatures in order to transform into them. To get him started, the game provides a rainbow colored bear with some nasty claws as his first creature. Of course, it all goes from there and this is where the game gets interesting.    Starting out the character creation screen is pretty minimal with the ability to create some simple creatures. As time goes on and points are earned by picking up coins from fallen enemies the players will level up and gain new creation abilities. These range from adding on some new types of body parts that swirl around or even gaining the ability to put some wheels on for a really fast character. This was a particularly pleasant surprise since this helped me to create the creature of my dreams, a pile of poo that could roll through the levels at ferocious speed. Man, that steaming lump of dookie could fly. Other developments are purely cosmetic with the ability to make new colors or even make different parts transparent for some cool effects.      After getting the hang of the creation screen and unlocking more and more abilities I found that the whole prospect of making some of the most bizarre and unholy creatures is what doesn't just help Graffiti Kingdom out, but in fact defines its own existence. This is what the game is all about and the rest, well, that's just a big arena to play with the oddities within. After playing around with this system for a while the rest of the game starts to make more sense. Not quite enough to make it fun, but at least it's understandable.   What makes sense after that is why all of the enemies had virtually no relation to each other. At times there would be a demon running around and at others there would be two cops fused together at the hip rolling around. Plants would flop around and attack with their root systems and then some jellyfish would float by for another assault. One of my favorites was seeing a UFO that was complete with three aliens standing underneath it. All of them were combined into a single unit and when hit they would all go flying.   Playing through the game it seems that the developers spent a ton of time refining the character creation tool and unleashing their hyperactive imaginations upon it. The engine is an enhanced version of what the same development team had created in their earlier game, Magic Pengel, and fans of that game will find some more toys to play with. Again, it would've been a big help if more time had been spent on giving players reasons to want to play through the game itself and really developed the single-player experience.    As it is, the main reason to play through the story here is purely to unlock all of the possible features within the character creation. After that, the main appeal is to go into a vs. battle with a friend to have a battle of the freaks to see whose bastard creation could win in a fight. And since there is no limit to what players can make, it's possible to make characters that flout any copyright laws. I'm not saying that anyone should do this, but if you wanted to throw in Pac-Man, Dig-Dug, or even get more creative with some more modern and detailed characters, then this is the tool for you. We've already seen plenty of videos of characters from gamers in Japan who already have a version of the game and we're sure to see even more once the game gets played and explored in America.   Rating such a game is a bit of a difficult task since Graffiti Kingdom unleashes a huge amount of potential for those who are willing to put in the time to know it, but still fails overall as a game. So in that way the game doesn't have a high score at all, but that by no means says that the game is totally worthless. Not at all. While I'm sure that there will be those who will fall in love with the game and the possibilities it provides, it still needed some more work so that it was more fun to play with the results.   As a way to make some characters that are sick and twisted or beautifully detailed, the character creation system in Graffiti Kingdom is an amazing tool. But that just makes it all the more heartbreaking when the rest of the game is such a simple and at times frustrating experience. The score for the game is for the overall package, but for those who are willing to look past the single-player this is a game that will surely earn a spot as a cult title.", "date": "Jul 27, 2005"}
