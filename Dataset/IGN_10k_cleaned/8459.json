The first co-op sidescroller (and the first game that allowed you to take weapons from enemies) Double Dragon is not just classic, it's legendary. That's why it's so disconcerting that Empire Interactive fumbled in bringing the original arcade Double-D to Xbox Live Arcade. Even at just 400 Microsoft Points (US$5), Double Dragon is the biggest disappointment yet to arrive on Xbox's virtual arcade.   Double Dragon has perhaps the best intro in arcade history. Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is standing outside a garage when a member of the Black Warriors walks up and slugs her in the breadbasket. She's taken for reasons unknown and it's up to twin brothers Billy and Jimmy Lee to get her back. This is epic arcade storytelling at its finest.   Over the course of four missions, players (either playing alone or cooperatively with a friend) kick and punch their way through scores of enemies. During the course of the rather short adventure, Billy and Jimmy Lee use their mastery of Sou-Setsu-Ken to bludgeon a variety of villains. Many of the enemies carry weapons, which can be taken and used. There's nothing quite like smacking down a villainous streetwalker and grabbing her whip. Or better yet, pick up some tossed dynamite and throw it back in the face or your enemy for a big kaboom (and Achievement Unlocked). Sadly, none of this is very satisfying on 360 thanks to some terrible slowdown.   One less uterus in the world to worry about. The enhanced version of Double Dragon, which looks beautiful (at least for an old arcade game), can't maintain a solid framerate for more than a few minutes at a time. In single-player there are a few hiccups, but in co-op the slowdown is almost constant. This is an arcade game, how the hell can it run so poorly on 360? The chuggy framerate disrupts the game's flow and quickly becomes aggravating. What should be a joyful throwback to the early days of videogaming is instead an exercise in frustration.     It doesn't help that Double Dragon has some design flaws. These were easy to ignore in the arcade as a kid, but now they are just a tad annoying. Things such as near-impossible-to-avoid traps and sometimes unresponsive controls should have been smoothed out for XBLA. I could live with these imperfections if Double Dragon ran better.   Fans should note that the version offered is the original arcade edition of Double Dragon. The NES version, which most gamers are familiar with, is a different game. You don't unlock moves in this version and the difficulty is considerably higher. Both are likely due to the fact that the arcade version of Double-D was meant to suck down quarters.   Though Double Dragon is a letdown on XBLA, there is one great moment for anyone who plays co-op. As in the arcade version, once you beat the final boss, Willy, the brothers turn on one another. Apparently Jimmy Lee always had a thing for Billy's girl. Whoever wins the fight earns the girl and the Achievement. It's a hilarious scene watching two friends trying to lure one another close enough for a powerful elbow smash. Plus, with only two characters on screen, the game finally runs smoothly.  Double Dragon can be fun, but it under-delivers. This is a five-dollar game. You deserve more than a crap framerate and lingering bugs. The fact that co-op is so difficult due to the slowdown sucks most of the joy from Double Dragon. I was one of the many eager to play Double Dragon on XBLA. The wait wasn't worth it. Save your cash. If you want to waste five bucks, send it my way. I could use it.", "date": "May 10, 2007"}
