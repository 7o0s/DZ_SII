Graphically the game was, arguably, head-and-shoulders above EA's NBA Live offerings.  One game was the Beauty and the other was The Beast, at least for a while.  The same held true for the gameplay aspects as well.  Live was the better game overall while ShootOut held its own based upon being a decent game of hoops with a nicer package.  Then, all of sudden, 989 began to really stumble.  Instead of improving the gameplay, by using its competition as a benchmark, the development teams seemingly laid back on their heels and let the other guys really gain ground.  Then for 1999 ShootOut was a no-show.  This was a sore spot for 989 - of that there is no doubt.  Now, in year two of the big comeback, we look at where the game is today.  We explore the graphics, the gameplay and contrast it against its numero uno competitor.  Presentation The more reviews I write, the more I realize that no matter how awesome the front-end presentation of a game is, once the post-production stuff is over and the game enters the 'game' that is when the points really start to tally.  However, in the spirit of complete fairness, I must expound some on the presentation of NBA ShootOut 2001.   Using an amalgam of cut video footage of game highlights coupled with the flash of various team logos, all set to the background of some rather snazzy tunes and the voice of a coach...inspiring his rim-ologists to win the game under adverse conditions, I would have to acquiesce to the fact that ShootOut 2001 does a super nifty job of setting the player up in anticipation of what's to come.  If you are like me, before you boot the game up, you have read all the propaganda on the back of the box, thumbed through the book a few times and sit poised to see the ~award-winning graphics~ and ~50 signature dunks~.  So after checking to make certain that you have gotten the requisite FMV treatment, replete with urban hip-hop tracks, you are now ready to dive into the gameplay.  Well, this game runs smooth as butter on the front end, and then all hell breaks loose in the backcourt.  Great presentation 989 but gameplay issues detract from the production values of the overall offering.  Gameplay I have to go blow-by-blow here to really make certain that I have not missed much.  So let me jump right on in here.  The game alleges to have a ~new~ Accelerated 3D Game Engine.  The game also boasts that it is fast - most likely as a result of this new accelerated engine...right?  Wrong.  If Live 2001 is the Hare, ShootOut 2001 is most certainly the tortoise.  This game is rather slow for a basketball title.  In fact, even when using the accelerate button, there is not as much of an appreciable difference in the speed of the game as in years past.  Why is this so?  I am not sure.  I can suspect that the stressed frame-rate may be a culprit in this, but one never knows...do one? Also, the game indicates that the controls are intuitive.  I would have to agree with this one for two reasons.  One, they (the controls) have not substantially changed and Two, the game is so slow that if you cannot figure out what to do or which button to hit (with all the time you have to decide) then something is seriously rotten in Denver...I mean Denmark.  There is slowdown all over this game and as a reviewer I just had to sit and really ponder why in the world this stuff happens to games with so much unrealized potential.  So I ran several things through my mind.  I pictured the mo-cap sessions, the many hours of coding, the bloopers that would certainly make the outtake real, the dunk sessions and even the hours spent drawing up the plays.  The bad part is, I thought of all of these things while jumping into the air trying to block a shot.  Well jeez kids...I certainly had enough time on the way up and down!  Seriously though, this is rather disappointing.  989 Sports fans have suffered a big letdown this year and with this game it simply has gotten worse.  Dispensing with the litany of ~you've got Season, Exhibition, All-Star Game yada yada yada stuff, I do want to add, up front, that the game is chock full of the usual and customary modes and player management features.  Okay, so I will give you a bit of the poop.  There are Trades, Free Agents, Created Players, a Draft and the flexibility to control the defensive match-ups in addition to calling real NBA plays.  The now commonplace 'play as any skill player' mode has been implanted here as well.  IN this mode, the player can call for the ball, force your team to shoot and force the team to pass as well.  So use the create player mode to place yourself on the roster and wreak havoc on unsuspecting defenses throughout the league. If all of that does not tickle your fancy, you can always give the ~Create Dunk:  mode a test drive.  While the interface for this feature is a bit cluncky, once you get yourself in the groove or the joint (as you will see upon entering) you will be able to create and name your dunk with relative ease.  So take your ball-slammin', toe-jammin', monster dunkin @55 to the Ceate Dunk screen and do something constructive in your NBA career!  Will ya?  The game boasts a TV-style presentation.  It is pretty tight, with the exception of the fact that the camera in ShootOut can get a bit hinky at times.  You will likely have to play around with the camera settings to find one the truly works to your advantage.  This is not a new issue, but 989 have apparently gone for more glitz to the detriment of base gameplay.  One of the more glaring issues has to do with rebounding.  Each time the ball comes off the boards it feels like the game becomes a playground free-for-all.  I never get the feeling that I have really boxed anyone out or can be sure that I am in the best position to get the rock.  Part of this peeve may be the fact that, unlike Live 2001, the ball does some strange things as it comes off the rim.  Any idiot can tell the trajectory and velocity of the ball in flight and when it impacts the glass or rim it should, reasonably, be expected to do certain things.  There is an inherent degree of inconsistency with this aspect of the game, so the rebounding game is shoddy at best.  Another puzzler, are the lanes.  CPU controlled players will frequently go to the top side of the court, just past the half-court mark, and will beeline for the basket, usually untouched.  This makes for great replays of serious dunks, but kills the credibility of this game tenfold.  ShootOut also has an odd way of handling on-the-fly passes.  The receiving players seem to break stride when catching the pass.  This throws off the continuity of the fast break and may be something rectifiable by cleaning up the poor frame rate. Taking shots is a mixed bag of goods.  The game seems at is paltry best when the Touch Shooting meter is in use.  The visual cues provided by the meter have served to give astute, multi-tasking players a decided edge when executing shots.  The Touch Shooting meter is based on your players shooting ability in that area of the court.  So the meter is easier to use in an area that the real-life player makes a larger percentage of his shots.  The downside to this method is that tenacious defenses mean virtually nothing if your opponent has the meter pinned just right.  On the other hand, the old-fashioned 'release the ball at the apex of the jump' routine has its own flaws.  It too seems to offer inconsistent results, again possibly frame rate related.  Perhaps if one could see more of the animation, it would be easier to decide when to release the shot?  Just a thought.  Regardless, the game does offer a healthy variety of shots and dribbles to enhance the gameplay.  In addition, you will find fewer shots being blocked than in years past and some better reads by CPU controlled players on defense.  On the other hand, rebounding is still left up mostly to the user and you better follow up on your own offensive boards, because if you wait long enough for the CPU to handle that for you, you will be cracking the cellophane on ShootOut 2002.  Rosters have not been completely addressed, as my main man Patrick Ewing is still a true Blue NY Kick!  This is whether you choose to use the 2K-2001 rosters or the ~Current~ rosters found in the game.  No problem really for me, since I am a Knick fan.  But we would like to have seen things switched around in the tables before final production.  The various player attributes are not fleshed out very well.  The momentum of a player in a back down is certainly based on size and weight but the visual effect of watching the Sprewells and the Bryants of the game get a step and shoot the hole is marred by the lane problems I mentioned earlier.  When you motion capture marquee players, you really ought to take the time to emulate as much of that players personality into the game as possible.  ShootOut did not do that well here, unless of course you are looking for every player to act and react like Chris Webber or Brevin Knight.  To make up for some of the many problems, there has been the inclusion of team-specific playbooks.  With a count of more than 450 plays designed by NBA pros, ShootOut has one robust play calling system at your disposal.  You will need them too, especially once you bump up the AI (that turns out really be an oxymoron of sorts).  Actually, it is not the AI that makes the game challenging, it is trying to devise a way to stop the CPU from jamming the ball down your throat on every play that makes one invoke the powers of the all-mighty playbook.  With the NBA Live series, people frequently complained about a feeling of slipperiness.  In ShootOut, it is a feeling of stickiness we have to deal with.  I never could get the feeling that I could make my players move their butts when I needed them to.  This exposes the players to more frequent steal attempts  something that has plagued ShootOut for years.  Add to this the fact that you can feel offensively lost, despite having mastered the simple control scheme and ShootOut 2001 comes up as a dead ball foul.    Graphics Well-proportioned courts, nicely articulated crowds, a crisp color palette and (amidst the slowdown) a host of nice animations give ShootOut and above average visual appeal.  However, despite the vivid colors and good geometry of the title, there is quite a noticeable bit of aliasing, flicker and pixelation to be found. Also, looking at the facial textures of the various players was a lot of fun.  Actually it was comical in some ways.  Kobe Bryant looks as if he is constantly smiling for a photo shoot while Charlie Ward almost looks faceless.  Certainly there are none of the EA Sports, fancy-schmancy animated facial features present here.  But to have a guy slam dunkin' on your tail with no viable defensive threat available  and he is grinning from ear-to-ear each time he does it is a bit much to take.  Player sizes are pretty varied and the Icon Passing is easy to use due to the well-designed 3D icons in play.  The players seen a bit blocky and unrefined, especially considering the amount of time this game has been on the workbench.  I also made mention earlier that the ball does some goofy things coming of the rebound.  Things like this are attributable to how visual aspects of a game are designed to work.  Hence, they have roots in the area of graphics and the visual appeal of a game.  I think that 989 should take a very careful look at these and other issues.  With a break from the creation of a 1999 offering, they should have been able to produce an NBA Live-killer application  given the tremendous lead-time they had on their hands.  Unfortunately, that has not been the case.   Sound Now here is where I think the game shines.  I guess I am inclined to really find favor with this aspect of the game in lieu of all the negatives I've laid on you thus far.  But objectivity is a prerequisite of the work so I push forward with great tact!  New Jersey Nets announcer Ian Eagle got the duties to cover the in-game commentary.  The mix is good.  The sound is, therefore, tight but he is a bit on the constipated sounding side of things.  What I mean is his commentary is not as fluid as stuff found in 989 games of old; although Eagle handled the voice work for ShootOut 2000 and it was touchy then too.  Sound FX in the game are smooth and believable, from the crowd noises to the bouncing of the ball on the parquet wood floors.  The music even thumps just right and the selections used fit the scheme of the game quite well.  Nothing is overly edgy sounding and the ambient effect derived is quite nice for a PS1 title.  989 Sports has gone so far as to have a lot of the actual music, found in arenas throughout the country, placed into the proper venues in the game.  This is a nice touch and something that really ads to the production values of the game. I am sorry that 989 has mastered how to mess a game up as it ages as opposed to making a game shine as it matures.  It has been hard, as a fan of the development house, to watch several of their sports titles wane over the last two or so years.  Unfortunately, ShootOut 2001 falls victim to the same scenario and is thus a let down in the end. Hope springs eternal, and while GameDay 20001 for the PS2 is certainly not a hope inducing effort, one can only pray that 989 will get their game legs back underneath them, so that the likes of EA, Konami and others will always be forced with stiff competition that generates ingenuity and demotes laxity. ShootOut 2001 is not the worse game of hoops you can likely play, but it is certainly not one that I would recommend if faced with providing subjective or objective input.", "date": "Nov 23, 2000"}
