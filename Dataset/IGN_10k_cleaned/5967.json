Back on Nintendo 64, the Aki-developed WCW and WrestleMania titles hooked a legion of followers and many of these same players continue to enjoy the company's wrestling titles on GameCube today, despite a few notable missteps. Some fans, for instance, were shocked and disappointed several years ago when Aki left the Nintendo side to develop for other platforms and others felt cheated when the WrestleMania franchise eventually followed suit. But Japanese studio Yuke's, whose GameCube-dedicated development team is comprised of former Aki members, has stepped up to fill the studio's place and based on last year's hit WWE Day of Reckoning, it's done a pretty good job of it. DoR was a positive step in the right direction for THQ's wrestling franchises. The title in many ways played catch-up to competing games, but it also brought a polished look and solid grapple-based play mechanics to the table, both complemented by a host of wrestlers and even a linear, but nevertheless entertaining storyline.  Day of Reckoning 2 is a direct sequel to its predecessor in that it actually continues the storyline laid down in the first game. It's also the better of the two titles thanks to several noticeable enhancements, from improved graphics and presentation to a more involving and strategic fight system. This of course means that it's the best wrestling game to grace GameCube yet. But that noted, it still lags behind some of its competitors in a couple of key areas, a truth that will once again put off a group of diehard fans.  The Facts  WWE-based wrestling game Direct sequel to WWE Day of Reckoning Continues the storyline of the first game; gamers will need to create new character Some 45 wrestlers to choose from, including Superstars, Divas, and Legends More than 10 play styles, from normal matches to Hell in a Cell and Last Man Standing 18 arenas including everything from Heat and Raw to Survivor Series and WrestleMania Tutorial mode teaches gamers to play like a pro Detailed create-a-superstar mode Earn money to buy extra arenas, weapons and more Enhanced grapple-based wrestling system over original Day of Reckoning New strategic submission and momentum shift systems Four-player compatible   Beefed Up Presentation -- Mostly Before writing this review, we reacquainted ourselves with the setup, look and feel of the original Day of Reckoning and there's no doubt that Yuke's has introduced dramatic improvements with the sequel. The overall presentation has undergone noticeable enhancements, which is made evident from the moment gamers boot the title up. Rather than sticking with a generic menu system, Yuke's has instead developed an interface that revolves around a mock ~THQ Arena~ stadium. The point is to make participants feel as though they are part of the wrestling environment even as they choose gameplay modes and options. Fitting heavy metal guitar riffs play as the main menu's different options are overlaid upon a panning stadium shot and when gamers select different modes, they are taken into new areas of the stadium, from the locker room to a training ring. Meanwhile, the wrestler selection menu layers the different superstars over the backdrop of a pro wrestling ring complete with Titantron and hundreds of fans. It all flows together nicely and sets the mood for things to come. Unfortunately, some of the menu-to-gameplay load times, which regularly last between 10 and 15 seconds, temporarily break the synergy.    Day of Reckoning 2 features 45 Superstars, Divas and Legends combined, which is a respectable number. By comparison, the game boasts five additional wrestlers over last year's version -- not exactly a gargantuan leap in numbers, but an improvement all the same. Fans will of course be happy to know that many of the biggest superstars are included in the roster, from Triple H, Undertaker, Batista, John Cena, Carlito, and Chris Jericho to Edge, Eugene, Heidenreich, JBL, Kane, Kurt Angle, Muhammad Hassan, Paul London, Randy Orton and Shelton Benjamin. Sadly, the Legends and Diva counts remain -- like last year -- at only five and four respectively. Yuke's has blown fresh air into the Legends selection with a cast of mostly new athletes, from The Rock and Hulk Hogan to Bret Hart, Stone Cold Steve Austin and yes, even Mankind. The Diva roster, on the other hand, looks largely similar to the lineup in last year's game, which of course means that most of the main beauties are there, but one or two remain missing in action.  The roster is overall solid, but when compared to other THQ wrestling games either already on the market or in development, it just doesn't stack up. For instance, SmackDown vs. Raw 2006 for PlayStation 2 includes a lineup of more than 50 wrestlers not counting Legends. The game will likely ship with between 10 and 15 more playable characters than Day of Reckoning 2, which is disappointing. Adding insult to injury, some of the more recognizable stars in the WWE, such as Doug Basham, Spike Dudley, Charlie Haas, Khosrow Daivari and Lita, are absent from DoR 2.     Gamers can thankfully test their skills in just about every major wrestling arena, from Raw, SmackDown, Heat, Velocity and WrestleMania to Backlash, Judgment Day, Bad Blood, Great American Bash, Vengeance, Summerslam, Unforgiven, No Merc, Taboo Tuesday, Survivor Series, Armageddon, Royal Rumble, and No Way Out. Many of these arenas are predictably locked until players make their way through DoR 2's story mode, which is an often used but nevertheless successful motivation ploy.       Meanwhile, most of the biggest wrestling match types are included. Players can take part in Single or Tag Team bouts, as well as Triple Threat, Fata 4 Way, Handicap and Royal Rumble. In addition, exhibition types can be set, from Normal, Hardcore and Ladder matches to Table, TLC, Steel Cage, Hell in a Cell, Last Man Standing, Bra & Panties (the Divas now wear tight schoolgirl outfits, which are certain to make perverts around the country as giddy as, uh, well, schoolgirls) and Ironman matches. All in all, a fairly robust selection of arenas and play types -- the most comprehensive list to hit the franchise yet.  Telling a Story Day of Reckoning 2's storyline is perhaps the title's biggest shortcoming. This is not to suggest that it's poor because it isn't. Actually, without giving anything away, there are some interesting twists and turns which successfully celebrate the different characteristics and attitudes of the Superstars and Divas, play on rivalries and girlfriends, and more. Many of the differing match types are also well used throughout the story mode. Most of the character dialogue accurately reflects the spoken content from the real wrestlers, too -- over-the-top though it may be. Finally, as gamers advance through the mode, they earn money, which can then be taken to WWE Shop.com (a mock retail store in the game) to buy all sorts of goods, from weapons to different ring entrances. It's a well executed driving force.   We don't have a problem with any of that. Issues do, however, arise in two key areas related to storyline presentation.   The first is that, although DoR 2 directly continues the first game's storyline, it doesn't actually enable players to import their created wrestlers from the original. This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that players' created wrestler was the star of the first effort. As a result, gamers will need to go into DoR 2's admittedly robust and flexible create-a-superstar system and generate a new star in order to ~continue~ the storyline in the game. Fans who held onto their original saved data can toss their memory cards in the trash because it'll do them no good. THQ says the reason for this oversight is because Yuke's developed all-new wrestler models that are more detailed and therefore unable to interact with the older, less defined characters.  The second disappointment relates to the relatively small storage capacity of GameCube discs. THQ told us early on that Yuke's was simply unable to fit voice dialogue into the game without compromising another, more important feature, such as proper ring entrances. Thus the choice was made to forego spoken dialogue in favor of text overlays. The result is the unfortunately awkward flow of story-related sequences. The developer has certainly tried to soften the blow, which is admirable. During some story-driven cut-scenes, a wrestler's theme music will play as he barks insults to foes. And meanwhile, the models themselves look and animate far more refined than ever before, as we'll get to in a moment. But even so, these wrestlers are Superstars in part because of their frothing, rage-filled dialogue, and they've all gone silent in Day of Reckoning 2.  In the end, there's still a lot to the story mode despite these drawbacks and we highly recommend that players check it out. However, Yuke's definitely has room for improvement and we've got our fingers crossed that future versions -- perhaps on Revolution -- will address some of our complaints.   Nitty Gritty The original Day of Reckoning delivered a well-crafted wrestling experience and the sequel improves upon the design in nearly every regard. Wrestling games have come a long way since their inception decades ago and DoR 2 is a reflection of that progress. Control is tight and the action is speedy. The tried-and-true light and heavy-based grappling system of the series is back and functions as intuitively before. In fact, the fight mechanics are overall very reminiscent of the first title. Gamers can quickly and easily execute a variety of moves, from the Irish Whip to turnbuckle fling attacks and ring tosses, all with a simple combination of button taps and control stick presses. The moves in the game are satisfyingly powerful, and as a result participants will really feel as though they have pummeled an opponent. There are literally dozens upon dozens of spectacular attacks that can be unleashed using the setup, and most of them are learned and mastered in no time flat -- a process made even easier thanks to a smart and helpful tutorial mode. On top of everything else, the game employs smart counter and reversal systems that enable players to anticipate attacks and counter them; and their opponents can reverse their counters. Exceptionally skilled gamers with finely tuned timing will be able to pull off some truly amazing feats.    Yuke's has spent some time refining the fight mechanics so that button mashing doesn't pay off, which is a positive. There are definitely still moments when gamers will need to tap the A button as quickly as they can -- like for instance, to get out of a potential pin or to lift a particularly heavy wrestler above their head. But for the most part, a new level of strategic play has been successfully injected into the experience thanks in large to the addition of a submission system that complements the stamina and momentum shift options already in place. Gamers can't simply run around the ring throwing blows or they'll tire their pro out pretty quickly, leaving them open to attack. They'll need to watch their stamina meter and devise a fight plan that ensures it doesn't drop too low. Determining how to approach each situation is half the fun.      The new submission system does away with the button mashing mechanics of old in favor of a camera-stick controlled option that offers more freedom and cuts down on chance. Gamers can actively choose to put opponents in four different submission holds, each with unique results that play into the strategy of bouts. A submit hold will drain an opponent's physical strength; a drain will deplete their stamina; a taunt will cut down on their spirit and a rest hold will help gamers regain some of their wrestler's stamina. These moves are performed by selecting up, right, left and down respectively on the camera stick after the wrestlers go into a submission. Readers can probably see how these different submissions have a profound bearing on each match, but we'll spell it out for those who don't. If, for instance, a wrestler's stamina is extremely low, he can put an opponent into a submission rest hold to gain some back. Meanwhile, a taunt submission will make it more difficult for an opponent to pin a gamer's wrestler.   Yuke's has made the submission system fun for multiple players, too, for even as the first gamer puts a wrestler into a hold, the second can try to guess what type of submission is being executed. If they guess correctly, they'll immediately break the hold and there may even be reverse drainage. It's a really cool and well-balanced setup that adds a lot to the gameplay dynamic.  Even when matches seem to be over, there's always the chance that gamers can turn everything around with a momentum shift. Players are allowed one per match so if they mess it up, it's all over. However, with correct timing, it's possible to go from having almost nil to near full stamina in a single move, and as a result a seemingly done for wrestler will be once more rearing to go. The move, undoubtedly inspired by countless Hulk Hogan revivals in years past, adds yet another layer of welcomed complexity and unpredictability to bouts.  During Tag Team play, there is even a bit of fun team management, albeit not terribly deep. Whenever gamers try to pin an opponent, their rival's teammate will jump in the ring to stop the move. However, players can with the Z button and D-Pad call upon their teammate to take down a rival as they attempt to pin an opponent, to knock down the referee, or to double team a wrestler. Again, strategy comes into play and it works very well for satisfying and entertaining results.  Clearly, we like the way DoR 2 plays, but it's not perfect. As far as wrestling games have come over the years, the game recreations of wrestlers have yet to equal the agility or speed of their real-life counterparts. Meanwhile, when playing against computer-controlled opponents, AI can be slow to react. Occasionally, it will simply stare at a fallen opponent, waiting for him to get up. Sometimes, an AI teammate will accidentally punch or kick a gamer's wrestler. Most frustrating of all, though, is that wrestlers sometimes face the wrong direction after recovering from a beating, leaving them open to more attack. We realize we can redirect them with the camera stick, but by the time we do that it's too late. Luckily, most of the issues are minimal and do not detract from the otherwise enjoyable experience.   Coming to Life WWE Day of Reckoning 2 is one of the best looking wrestling games to hit the market yet. Last year's game was already a step in the right direction by Yuke's, as it brought more lifelike wrestlers and environments to the table. The sequel makes some notable visual enhancements all the same. Wrestler models have undergone significant polygon count leaps, and as a result the soft, almost cartoony look of last year's pros has been replaced by more realistic, defined characters. According to THQ, many of the added polygons have gone to the heads of these wrestlers, quite literally. Players will immediately notice in close-up shots that faces of wrestlers now come to life with protruding geometry, inset eyes and even mouths that open to reveal teeth within. It sounds eerie, but it all looks fantastic. Yuke's has likewise paid attention to the little details, ensuring that every last tattoo is accurately reflected on the arms and chests of athletes and that their skin is covered in a believable sweaty sheen.   Readers would be well suited to head over to our video section and see some of the wrestler entrances for themselves. We think most gamers will be extremely pleased with what Yuke's has accomplished. Some entrances are slightly off. For instance, Batista lacks his proper pyrotechnics, but for the most part the developer nailed it. The models look outstanding and animate more fluidly than ever before. Meanwhile, as they make their way to the stage, they are engulfed in a series of graphic effects, from strobes (with real-time environmental lighting) to fireworks and even a thick fog, which naturally accompanies the Undertaker's walk. Eddie Guerrero rolls into the arenas in his lowrider, hydraulics lifting the car to the left and right again, and it looks spot-on.   Yuke's has seriously improved the look and animation of the arena crowds, which surround the ring, chanting and screaming realistically during matches. The crowd models are more varied and the stadium seating seemingly bigger and more lifelike than we can remember. It's an impressive enhancement, to be sure. Finally, a number of smaller, but nevertheless important visual additions go a long way. For instance, sweat splatters off the faces and bodies of wrestlers when they take a hard hit or kick and the mat becomes stained with various degrees of blood when bouts get rough.  There are some visual shortcomings, however. Video displayed on the Titantron appears to be overly compressed as wrestlers take the stage. Meanwhile, due to the size differences of Superstars, especially where created characters are concerned, players are bound to encounter polygonal clipping during some matches, particularly during holds. Also, for some stupid reason, Yuke's continues to deny GameCube owners a progressive-scan mode despite the fact that it would certainly make the game look even better on high-definition televisions.WWE Day of Reckoning 2 is the best wrestling game to hit GameCube yet. So if you liked last year's version, you're going to like this one even more. It's not a title without problems. Namely, the story mode is frustratingly hampered by the fact that you can't import your created wrestler from the original, and the lack of spoken dialogue puts a dent in presentation. Meanwhile, the roster, while certainly solid, is not quite up to snuff with some competing wrestling games. But even so, there's a lot to like about this latest entry to the series. The control mechanics, already solidly grapple-heavy and speedy, are made more intuitive still by a strategic synergy between stamina and submission systems, and complemented again by a fun momentum shift. The result is a wrestling game with less button mashing and more strategy. Add in the fact that DoR 2 is mostly beautiful and it's clear that Yuke's has largely delivered. Whether you're a diehard wrestling fan or just someone looking for a fun multiplayer experience, DoR 2 is worth your attention.", "date": "Aug 27, 2005"}
