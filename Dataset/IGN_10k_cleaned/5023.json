For the unknowing, there was once a child born in an ancient era infested by monsters and to a father willing to sell off 48 of his body parts to well paying demons for the promise of power. And sell them he did. It was only because of a techno-wossname gadget master that the child survived. But, he had to be augmented by 48 devices to replace his missing limbs, joints, organs, appendages, and...um...other things. This child eventually grows into a warrior, a warrior on a quest to reclaim his humanity. Meet Hyakkimaru.  Since universal law demands all Japanese super augmented killing machines / demon hunters be accompanied by obnoxious brat sidekicks, Hyakkimaru quickly finds himself in league with Dororo, a preposterously troublesome child thief who's better at sucking than being helpful. ~If only I could have been partnered with some kind of fern,~ Hyakkimaru thinks.  And off they go! Together the two venture across lands, chop the holy heck out of a variety of not so placid beasts, and encounter the 48 demons who hold Hyakkimaru's many parts. This is his adventure. This is Sega's Blood Will Tell; it's a collection of pattern specific boss fights strung together by a bit of Dororo control and a lot of hacking and slashing on basic principle. It's a fairly standard setup tied to a fairly basic game that features both an intriguing concept and a poorly worked out kind of action.  Upper-Brat!  Throughout the game, Hyakkimaru earns basic parts that replace more advanced ones. This kind of starting strong and ending weak mechanic is interesting, to say the least. To offset the limitations a normal knee has opposed to some kind of cannon, Sega develops the character with new, more human, but more powerful capabilities. For instance, conventional swordplay will eventually replace the short blades Hyakkimaru had fastened to his arms. Stuff like this could add range, power, speed, and more. It's a very cool idea that plays out extremely well and adds a real sense of achievement to beating most of the game's many bosses. Unfortunately, the actual beating part needs work.   Blood Will Tell uses categorically imprecise camera and controls to maximize inflicted damage and highlight the stylish art. This, sadly, doesn't translate to solid gameplay. In many situations, it's simply impossible to determine where exactly Hyakkimaru is in relation to his victim and, more importantly, his victim's counterattacks. This means that there is a lot of unnecessary dying and pain taking -- a problem that's compounded by what appears to be some ridiculously large bounding boxes. Even if it seems that Hyakkimaru is nowhere near that incoming jab, stab, slash, or whooping demon tentacle, there's a very good chance he'll get hit anyway, partly because the game offers little the way of avoidance assistance and also because Hyakkimaru is bound by an invisible barrier that determines where he takes damage, as opposed to an arm that can get hit in the arm.  This downgrades an otherwise enjoyable, if consistently straightforward action experience. There are combos to pull and special techniques to use, but for the most part, the game feels more about stringing together endless lines of whirling attacks and hoping to not get hit than it does actually combating an enemy. Of course, standing toe-to-toe with a giant purple evil thing isn't such a good idea. And that's the point of Blood Will Tell. The main character is powerful and capable of dispensing death, but it's only through the determination of preset boss patterns that this release can be possible. The game then turns out to feel and be more like a steady stream of progressively more difficult encounters with more advanced patterns that need to be deciphered. This throwback to old school action gaming is tied together quite well, for the most part.  For the most part... Tricky phrase, that is. Between all the beatings there come totally superfluous and incredibly frustrating platforming segments along with a little Dororo control. Both components should have been scrapped entirely since the underlying gameplay doesn't suit well either. The premise, the control, and the camera are not ideally made to accommodate pit leaping or brat kid play.   If you can get past these rather serious qualms and fall into the game itself, you'll discover a technically adequate but artistically inspired title. The characters, in particular (especially given that the environments are of a decidedly bland variety), exude a level of care and polish that we don't see too often. They also come straight out of Japanese mythology, which gives them a creepy, appropriate, but still outlandish appeal. Aurally, it's a collection of typically whiny anime sound effects, some slick tunes, and a variety of blings and clings that normally equip a third-person action game. Standardized. I find myself pressed to extend this review with some frivolous text, but Blood Will Tell's very nature prevents me from doing this. Reciting previews and expunging a lot of bulleted features is always a possibility, but the game is summed. Blood Will Tell is a chopper. You walk around beating things. The camera is obtrusive, the collision detection questionable, and the platforming elements are absurdly unnecessary and very unwanted. Fortunately, the boss battles are engaging and hearken back to a time when gaming was about both reflex and pattern. This nostalgic appeal coupled with a genuinely unique premise will let devout followers of the creator or his work get into Blood Will Tell, but likely only for a limited time.", "date": "Sep 23, 2004"}
