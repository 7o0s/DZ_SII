{"name": "Hugo: The Evil Mirror", "name_review": "Hugo: The Evil Mirror", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/04/13/hugo-the-evil-mirror", "text": ", a Danish-developed title published two years ago, has been brought over by Namco to fill the company's extensive library of 2005 handheld titles. Its title alone is misleading enough: though the game sounds like a platform adventure, it's instead a unique old-school arcade game design. But because the guy's an import from Denmark, no one in North America's going to know who the heck Hugo the troll is beyond the face on the box; at least the gameplay within is somewhat engaging and clever, if just a little loose, repetitive, and a bit on the short side. Hugo: The Evil Mirror is a basic arcade platformer of approximately 60 levels of exactly the same task. In each challenge, players must leap along platform layouts and freeze enemies with a special ice cannon. Turning enemies into cubes will take them out of commission for a few seconds if left alone, but if you choose to carry them they'll stay cubes for as long as you can hold them. Shattering the cubes by leaping on them or dropping them one or more stories will take them out for good, but they'll return to the playfield if you don't seal up the portals scattered across the level. Once all the enemies have been defeated, it's off to the next level of increasing difficulty.  But as simple as the task sounds, there are little elements that add some technique to the basic idea. Combining cubes will form increasingly bigger bricks of ice, which are heavier to carry but offer much more reward if they're shattered from play. On the downside, large cubes generally hold a beast within that must be defeated after it's freed from its ice prison, something you don't have to deal with by breaking enemy cubes individually. But the bonus for doing this is great: by scooping up all on-screen enemies into a cube and breaking it, you can score important items like a character power-up or, more necessary, a key that will enable you to save the game in progress so you can take a break and record all the collectibles you've scored.  The Evil Mirror in Hugo: The Evil Mirror is only a plot device that never, ever comes into play during the actual action. Essentially, Hugo's been sucked into a shattered mirror, and it's up to his kids to recover each of the three pieces to reconstruct the mirror and free their Pa. But the whole mirror fiasco doesn't really make too much sense in the context of the game design, it's more just a vehicle to create three different areas and a collectible at the end of each of them.  The game starts off incredibly slow and tedious, but it's the later level that not only does the difficulty starts to kick in, but the little techniques make themselves known. It would be a nifty little arcade game as it is if the developers tightened up the presentation. It's a bit of a drag, for example, to have to sit through a ridiculously stupid dance animation after finishing every single level in the game. Hugo: The Evil Mirror's save function is also a bit limiting; even though it's clear that the game would be over way too quickly if players could save anywhere at anytime, only offering a limited number of saves via a randomly appearing collectible means that players may have to wait a very long time in order to record their progress so they can turn off their system. Hugo: The Evil Mirror's art direction is obviously driven by the license that it's attached to, but that doesn't excuse some of the really dumb sprite animations that these characters have. When you have to watch these trolls throw their hands around in a dumb dance in victory every two minutes, the blandness of the animation really comes into view. Especially when the camera, for some reason, zooms in on the character every time the level ends. The art's not all bad, though, and the game engine itself handles some nifty effects, like the already mentioned ~zoom~ function as well as transparencies for the growing ice blocks. Hugo: The Evil Mirror is a better-than-average arcade game for the Game Boy Advance that's both simple in concept and deep in technique. The problem is that the three different areas barely offer anything the previous one already did, so there's a distinct lack of variety throughout the experience. It could have been presented a bit more tightly without a lot of the extraneous segues between levels, and the save feature needed to be tweaked a bit more in the player's favor. 60 levels only goes so far, though, and you'll be finished this one in a day once you figure out the techniques. But it's a fun little ride while it lasts.", "date": "Apr 13, 2005"}
