Since Superman occupies an entirely different realm, the Fantastic Four are called into action to discover the meaning of the Surfer and hopefully avert the impending disaster. And if the consumption of earth was enough of a headache for Reed Richards and his friends, Dr. Doom is back and ready to complicate matters.   So, how will you stop humankind's spiraling descent into oblivion? How about six mini-games? Hands-On shouldn't be immediately discounted for going the casual route -- this is mobile, after all. But the six mini-games that represent this saga are, on the whole, brisk and empty. An average player could burn through all six in under an hour. Replay value is at an all-time low here, stripping the game of a lot of its value. However, Hands-On has done something remarkable here -- something that more mobile publishers should do to combat the question of value: Offering extras. Players unlock a series of wallpapers of the heroes by playing the game, and fans of the Fantastic Four will actually want these for their phones.   The six mini-games are:   Cross the cosmos with the Silver Surfer, pressing the OK key to keep him aloft. Avoid asteroids, pick-up a handful of power-ups like speed boosts and health, and try to shred the tops of the space rocks for bonus points.   Throw a tank with the Thing by lining up the angle of your shot and the power. Once the tank is in the air, you have three shots to keep the machine moving. Hitting walls ends your run, but if you bounce it off of army equipment, you can get extra speed and altitude.   Guide Mr. Fantastic's arm through a series of mazes, turning off steam values to reach a security button.   Unleash Sue Storm's force fields in a chamber full of robot drones. Charge the field and then release just as the robots close in, then steer Sue back down to the ground to destroy as many as she can.   Blast incoming rockets with the Human Torch. Missile volleys rise over the city and then come crashing back down. Time your explosive burst just right to engulf as many of the rockets as possible.   Chase down Dr. Doom if the Fantasticar, avoiding stone walls and arches. After avoiding enough obstacles, the car opens fire on Doom. The second part of the game pits the Surfer against Dr. Doom with the same mechanics.   The best event of the game is the Thing's tank throw. The worst is the Mr. Fantastic sequence. Somewhere in the middle -- the final chase through the lava with the Surfer and the Fantasticar. It's just too easy to avoid Doom's shots. In fact, the whole thing is too easy on your first pass. If you go back and replay the mini-games after beating the game, you might find another fifteen minutes of play time. Maybe.   Rise of the Silver Surfer looks okay -- the game certainly gets the color choices and character models right, even when their really small like the Sue Storm sequence or the Surfer's first ride. The audio is just decent.  Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer is just too breezy to recommend to anybody but the biggest fans -- and if that's you, you'll be happy about the wallpapers you can unlock during play. Really -- that's a very cool extra for Hands-On to offer. More movie games need to do this to increase their value to mobile gamers.", "date": "Jun 6, 2007"}
