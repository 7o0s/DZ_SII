A game where Cory Nastazio cannot do a tabletop is not doing justice to the sport.  Activision obviously recognized the game's shortcomings and enlisted Rainbow Studios to develop the sequel, resulting in a game that is entirely new in every way -- the technology, animation, and game mechanics are all new, with the only holdover being the various famous names.  But now, the problems have been reversed, somewhat. This is a killer BMX sim, but it may not as much fun to play as you think.  If all you want to do is ride, Mat Hoffman 2 is your game.  The trick selection and bike control are both top-notch, the graphics engine inspires only minor complaints, and it presents the sport in a uniquely relaxed, low-key way.  The single-player mode is presented as a road trip, moving from level to level with little slice-of-BMX-life video clips in between.  The trouble, however, is advancing from level to level.  The objective structure is designed such that you get hung up on a single task far too easily and far too often.  This wouldn't be as much of a problem if it didn't limit the selection of levels so badly at times.  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 had a much better progression structure -- it was still reasonably challenging, but it opened up new levels more quickly.  It's not as if this limited the replay value of the game in any way, considering how much it's been played by us and so many others around the world, and it cut down on the amount of time spent hurling yourself at a particular gap, transfer, or line.  Mat Hoffman 2 is frequently all about hurling yourself at a single task, over and over again, and it holds back the potential of what is otherwise a very well-designed game.  The Facts  All-new to the series, tour the country and travel to eight different cities Check out candid clips and interview material from a real Hoffman road trip along the way Pull off flatland tricks and add a whole new level of diversity to BMX extreme gaming Ride as Mat Hoffman and other pro riders including Ruben Alcantara, Cory Nastazio, Mike Escamilla, Nathan Wessel, Joe Kowalski and many more Cities come to life with helicopters, boats, cars and pedestrians. Multiple skill-based tiers of objectives make the career mode enormous No progressive scan support Requires 18 blocks of memory   Gameplay The Mat Hoffman franchise began by mimicking the Tony Hawk control scheme.  That wasn't such a bad idea in concept.  It fell apart, however, when its developers fitted it out with a very questionable physics model and a small, random selection of tricks. Cory Nastazio couldn't do a tabletop, which looked awfully silly in comparison to the broad and versatile trick system in the competing Dave Mirra.  A couple of very poor level designs were the icing on a disappointing cake.  Taking a hold of the reigns, Rainbow Studios has fixed more or less all of that.  Mat Hoffman 2's trick system still obviously derives from Tony Hawk, but there are many more tricks, mapped to double-tap commands and the like, and it includes an expanded flatland system that works a fair bit better than the one in Tony Hawk 3.  Flatland tricks are simply face button commands performed in a manual -- there aren't quite as many we'd like to see (more easily-linked basic tricks for starters), but the animation for what tricks there are is excellent.  On a more basic level, the bike behavior in this game is quite good.  Rainbow obviously has a lot of experience simulating the physics of two-wheeled vehicles, and it shows here.  You still see the odd unrealistic landing, and some movement in the air that bends the suspension of disbelief (there's just one center of gravity, so the turning looks a little odd), but when you crash in this game, the bikes fly very well.     It's fun to ride, tricks are entertaining, and Rainbow's level design provides plenty of opportunities to create lines and combinations.  The levels are good-sized, a fair bit bigger than those in Tony Hawk 3, but there's more than enough architecture to fill them. In particular, Rainbow's designers have the knack for building up along the vertical axis, adding more layers of rails and lines.  With all this good, does it have any problems? Well, this requires a little math.  Like any game in this genre, Mat Hoffman 2 presents a series of challenges to be accomplished in each level. In this case, there are twelve per level, grouped into three categories -- amateur, semi-pro, and pro.  You only have access to one set of objectives at a time, so all four goals in that skill area must be cleared before you can do the next four, and so on.  Completing a level earns a certain number of road trip points, which are spent to unlock new levels across the country. Naturally, the point cost increases as you travel through the various cities.   What this translates into is a bit of a progress blockade after a few levels. Many of the challenges are difficult and tedious -- the ~fetch five [whatever]~ quests are particularly nasty, thanks to the bigger levels -- and others just aren't explained properly.  New Orleans, for example, requires that you ~'Flip' Out The Jazz Trio~ in order to complete the pro level.  No explanation is given regarding what that means.  Is this fun, dinking around the same three halfpipes, trying to figure out which variation on a back flip you need to do to finish the objective?  Last year's version of Dave Mirra suffered from similar problems, and it doesn't seem that Rainbow learned from other's mistakes. The different levels also aren't anywhere near consistent as far as the difficulty of the tasks grouped together.  To use New Orleans as an example again, the semi-pro level includes three tasks that are ridiculously easy and one that's cursed hard.  If these are meant to represent gradations of the player's skill, they ought to be grouped together more appropriately.  It's unfortunate that progression becomes so tedious, because the road trip videos that you experience along the single-player quest are pretty entertaining.  Scattered in between different levels, the videos in Mat Hoffman 2 aren't necessarily just a continuous stream of big tricks. Many of them don't have any tricks at all -- they're just little bits of a real-life road trip taken to promote the game.  Many of the clips are, if nothing else, very funny, although the punch line occasionally gets a little lost.  The pace of progression is certainly subjective, depending on your skill level, but the fact of the matter is that all the Tony Hawk games were just fine without making the challenges too difficult. Gamers still played them for hours on end after unlocking all the levels, and never looked back.  If you just want to tool around and do tricks, the multiplayer and park editor modes serve their purpose in that regard.  Park editor has three basic themes and a part selection about on order with Tony Hawk 2, plus much more space to work with than in that game.  If you're annoyed about the game's unwillingness to unlock its levels for you, hey, go ahead and make your own.    Graphics Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX 2 isn't exactly up to par with titles Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 or even Dave Mirra BMX 2 in some regards, but it doesn't look bad either. It has some pretty massive, branching level designs, filled with lots of architecture, but the texture implementation needs work. By GameCube standards, it's not taking advantage of a lot.  On the plus side, it does offer up some very slick animations. In fact, the animations are most definitely Hoffman 2's strongest visual feature. The flatland tricks look incredibly smooth and realistic, and the rest of the trick sets are no slouch either.   Those interested in the road trip cut-scenes should also be aware that they are highly compressed and even framed to a smaller size. Hopefully if there's another effort like this from Activision it will look into DivX for GCN, which was just recently announced.  HDTV owners hoping for the a visual boost from progressive scan will have to look elsewhere.   Sound The first Hoffman title was pretty brilliant in the soundtrack department, but, by comparison, the sequel falls a little short, the victim of some poor licensing decisions.  ~Institutionalized~ by Suicidal Tendencies is a welcome addition, ~Return of the Living Bassheads~ from Digital Assassins isn't bad as remixes go, and ~The Passenger,~ by Iggy Pop is an interesting addition.  Overall, it's a pretty balanced selection with rock, hip-hop, punk, and the like, with as much of the same character as the first game. However, it pales in comparison to the effort that Activision put into Tony Hawk 3, and, now, THPS4, which is home to one of the most impressive extreme sports soundtracks yet.  As far as issues that were in the developer's control, the sound effects are mostly of the familiar sort; grinds, bails, and spinning in freewheel sounds fairly accurate. And, there are some neat pieces of engineering when elements of the background interact with the soundtrack.  In New Orleans, for example, the jazz combo fades in and out depending on your proximity, mixing with or replacing the ordinary background music tracks.  Voiceovers, unfortunately, in the cut-scenes are compressed down enough to have an annoying ~buzz~ to accompany them.As always, your mileage may vary.  I definitely recommend that fans of the genre or the sport try this game, because it does almost everything very well.  There's absolutely no reason to give it a pass because you were diappointed in the first Mat Hoffman, because the two games have nothing besides the name in common.  Maybe those with more patience or persistence than I will be able to get more out of it.I still think, however, that this would have been more fun, and no less replayable, if Rainbow had dialed down the difficulty a little bit.  Re-jigger the numbers to open levels more quickly.  Maybe make more tasks available at once, so you could address yourself to more different challenges -- four is a little on the thin side.  Or keep the most difficult challenges, but attach different rewards to them, again opening levels a little more quickly.In any event, try it for yourself.  In the meantime, I'll go hurl myself at this transfer for a while.", "date": "Oct 18, 2002"}
