The super-slick anti-hero wields a not-quite-lightsaber and rides a giant Akira-style bike known as 'Schpeltiger' through the generic American city of Santa Destroy on a mission to become the number one assassin in the world. This is No More Heroes for you; a marriage of over-zealous, westernised, open-world gameplay blended with pure arcade thrills and aimed dead-on at mature gamers. Not all of it works  in fact, the game is rough around the edges and definitely more style than substance at times, but at least Suda51 is taking a few risks.   You're immediately tossed into the action; a very minor introductory cutscene spells out the background in vague terms, but it's not until after completing the opening mansion-raid level that the plot really begins to coalesce. Travis kind of fell into his present situation; as such, he starts out at the bottom rung of a tall ladder. In order to progress his way though the assassination tournament, he needs to earn enough money to pay the increasingly exorbitant entry fee. That means taking on menial jobs and performing ad-hoc killing sprees for a cash reward  and it is here that the scope and structure of the game really reveals itself.   This is a very arcade-style hack and slash game; it's not about enemy AI, taking cover, jumping onto crates or using a rocket launcher to blow up oil drums. It's about clashing light blades, timing your counter-attacks and linear progression against continuously worsening odds. For people who played the PS2 game God Hand, you might understand what I mean a little better. It eschews logic and realism at all times, reverting back to something approaching the simplicity of a 2D SNES fighting game made into a rough-edged but jovial 3D action game.     This mentality extends to things like the menu screen, HUD and map systems, which have all been reduced to pixel art and minimalist representations. Between major assassination missions, the game celebrates your progress with an early-80s era high-score table, complete with retro midi tunes. Everything is an in-joke, a pop culture reference and a loving homage. Progressing through linear settings like corridors and parking lots, key points are highlighted with giant pixel-art indicators too. Suda51 nails this all-in approach to the game's setting, and he even integrates this into the combat, which is as strange as it is compelling.   Using the spatial awareness built into the Wii remote, you can raise or lower the beam katana in the game to determine the height of your swing. Tapping A swings the katana, while finishing moves are activated by swiping in the direction of an indicator that pops up on the screen at the climactic moment of each encounter. That is barely scratching the surface of the combat, however. You can also lock on, counter, grapple and throw, impale, circle around, charge up and unleash electrified devastation at your discretion. Complicating things even further, three slot machine reels spin as you kill each enemy. Line up three of the same symbols and Travis enters 'Dark Side' mode, where you're literally transformed into a Sayan-like white-haired super-killer, capable of firing beams of light, activating timed-button-press attacks, wiping out all enemies and performing cinematic kills.   Waggle! Waggle like your life depends on it!  The pace is fluid, thanks to the Z-button lock-on. Eventually upgrading your combos pays dividends too, since the action just gets more interesting and flexible from there. Travis, being a big wrestling fan, draws many of his later moves from the world of Mexican wrestling, and the results are often hilarious. Frustratingly, the katana does lose its charge rapidly, requiring you to break away from the action and hit 1, bringing up a strange and almost masturbatory animation as you shake the remote from side to side to recharge it.   Not unlike a Japanese take on Grand Theft Auto (a game series and style that is generally not embraced by Japanese gamers), Suda 1 takes a sandbox city and makes it into a menu system of sorts. This is a hub of to-and-fro waypoints, where very little action actually occurs in and of itself; rather, you just need to enter the right doorway to trigger the next task or mission.    In simple terms, that really just means this is a big, open city with nothing to actually do in it, outside of foraging in dumpsters for loot or poking at the ground for secret stashes of treasure. It's essentially a big, empty hub. And that, friends, means there's very little reason for this to be set in a sandbox city at all. This was only done, I believe, to make the game more palatable to a western audience (seeing as GTA-style games continue to be the rage out here)  and it actually ended up costing No More Heroes some serious marks. It's our fault. We brought it on ourselves. The bitter irony of it all!    At times, No More Heroes almost realises this; inside Travis' apartment, you simply navigate a very slick menu system and Travis himself will walk around appropriately. It's clever, streamlined and handled in such a way that it gets you to where you want to go without making you labour your way through sparse traffic, long streets and minutes-worth of driving tedium.   Wading through this gameplay grey area, the side jobs are pretty entertaining. Clipping grass, collecting cocoanuts and eventually removing landmines are hardly feats worth the time of any assassin worth his salt. But these too are handled with trademark humour, and you never feel taxed or gypped after playing through most of them.   All of this barely touches on No More Heroes' greatest asset  its personality. This is a game that exudes style  usually at the expense of substance. Every character spouts lines that are brilliant in their over-importance and trashiness. Quips and retorts fly out in every heated exchange. Characters with impossible hair and camp outfits face off in iconic sets that we won't spoil for you here. The English dub is excellent  one of the better jobs in recent memory, too.   Yeah, uh, lawnmowing can be a lucrative and morally rewarding career choice. Who needs assassinations, anyway?  When you're not off killing and mowing lawns, you can spend your time collecting trading cards, improving your wardrobe, watching TV and playing minigames too. All of this is integrated into the setting so nicely that reminds us of the better moments of Shenmue, with its job systems and similar hang-ups on Japanese culture.   The visuals, filtered out in quasi-HDR shades and presented in semi-cell shading, smack of killer7. While the city itself is at times very sparse and lacking in textural detail, major landmarks are lovingly detailed and we definitely dig the hyper-contrast shadows and spot-on animation. The whole game would benefit from an injection of hardware power, but the Wii's controls actually compliment the gameplay (for a change  and yeah, we're as shocked as you are).   One thing we do miss is gushing torrents of blood when Travis lands a blow with his blade, present in some regional versions of the game. Cut from the western release, the lack of more visual cues actually does detract from the experience; sometimes, in the flurry of action, it can be hard to tell when a hit has connected or when it's been deflected.   There are issues with the sensitivity of the motion controls  as there are in almost every Wii title, and the overworld is a vacuous waste of memory with some terrible pop-in, but when you excise that from the combat scenarios, the humour, the style and the creativity that seeps out of most elements in No More Heroes, we can't help but get enthused about this game. This is game development risk-taking and we applaud it. Now, go out and buy the damned thing so that Suda51 still has a job. Go!", "date": "Mar 20, 2008"}
