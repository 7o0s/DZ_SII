{"name": "Root Beer Tapper", "name_review": "Root Beer Tapper", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/02/12/root-beer-tapper", "text": "is the kind of arcade classic that seems made for mobile. The simplistic concept and control scheme map naturaly to a handset. Use the thumbpad to move between rows and rows of thirsty customers, press the ~OK~ key to sling sarsaparilla at them. Once they have slaked their thirst, you must pick up the empties before they crash to the floor. The mobile edition also includes the mini-game starring the can-shaking bandit.   The game was s simple pleasure back in the 80s, and it's a simple pleasure now. While it's not the deepest game in the THQ Wireless stable, it's something to pass the time with between classes or meetings. Hardcore arcadeheads might be a little disappointed by the scaled-down visuals -- the titular tapper looks a little funky -- but the essence is there. Good for fans, but maybe not the best download on the deck.", "date": "Feb 12, 2005"}
