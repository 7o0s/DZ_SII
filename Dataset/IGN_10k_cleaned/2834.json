A virtual paradise for fans of the genre, the high-resolution goodness that Capcom provided on that system guaranteed me many a moment of Zen. As the cruel sands of time began to pass however, support for the failing system faded away like the ghost of coin-op past, and the excellent martial arts action I had grown so accustomed to became a privilege instead of an expectation. Luckily, I still have those fond memories to keep me going.   Of those fond memories, none of them ever matched the anticipation and satisfaction I experienced when the much ballyhooed cross-company rivalry Capcom vs. SNK crash-landed onto the swirl in September of 2000. A smart mixture of both developers' historic fighting engines, Capcom vs. SNK wasn't the greatest fighter in the word not at all. But for a longtime fan like me, it was paradise.   Which is made it all the more exciting for me this week when we received the review copy for the PSOne incarnation of Capcom vs. SNK Pro. The semi-different follow-up to the original CvS, Pro is a finely tuned, extra character-laden semi-sequel that had import junkies salivating all over again when it was released nine months later. Anxious to see how well the game retained itself on the weaker hardware (and struck perhaps with a bit of nostalgia), I fired up my brand new copy in hopes to relive the magic from a few years ago.   Features  If you never played either of the original Dreamcast games, then you're in for a real treat. As Capcom vs. SNK is jam packed with characters from both videogame universes. Borrowing personalities from the popular King of Fighters and Street Fighter franchises, there are 34 selections in all (which for the most part, have been directly ripped from Street Fighter Alpha 3 and KOF '98; each with their own moves, specials, and techniques. And though the majority of the fighters do end up playing in a similar fashion, the sheer variety of choices is enticing.   Additionally, the standard versus and arcade modes that all fighting games have are offered up as well. Including the much talked about ~Pair Match Mode~. A great way to forego a characters ratio setting (more on that later) and play whomever you want, ~Pair~ lets you choose any two fighters in the game to square off against another two regardless of their power. A popular option in local arcades, the ~Pair Match~ is where it's at people!   Bonus features like Color Edit (a tool that lets you custom paint your fighters into whatever you want, re: Orochi Benimaru.), Training Mode (self-explanatory), and Price Mode round out the selection screen as well. Though we expect that most of you will spend the majority of your early matches with ~Price~, as it is the key to unlocking hidden characters and abilities for more advanced sessions of the game (plus it's the only way to unveil Morrigan, Nokururu, Evil Ryu, the EX versions of every character, and a lot more). Bought with ~VS.~ points that are attained through constant fighting and visits to the training arena, a constant dedication to playing multiple matches is definitely encouraged.   The only extra that we didn't get that I was really hoping for, was some sort of Survival option. A great way to test your skills and pass the time simultaneously, it's an awesome addition that always adds a lot to even the most boring of fighting games. I'm sad to see it absent. Ah well, at least we get to play with Dan and Joe at the same time -- Score!   Gameplay  Let's face it. Capcom and SNK both have been slaving away with the fighting genre for eons, and if there are any two companies out there who know their stuff, it's those two. From Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting to Street Fighter and DarkStalkers, the legendary masters of the fist rarely miss the mark. And while both companies have had better efforts in the past, Capcom vs. SNK Pro still rates extremely high on the playability factor.   Not nearly as complicated as CvS 2, the fighting modes are broken down into two basic types: Capcom Groove and SNK Groove. While the Capcom version fills its power meter through defense and offense that's eventually unleashed into some nasty super moves, the SNK alternative requires the player to charge their own power meter through discretionary button pushes (and special non-chargeable attacks called Desperations).   Once you've picked your groove, it's Street Fighter as usual with the typical fireballs, hurricane kicks, and dragon uppercuts. Unfortunately, it doesn't stray too far past this mold. Discouraging juggles, parries, and air battles, Capcom vs. SNK is a more straightforward struggle than most of today's modern entries. And while the familiar system responds well to direction input and moves just as quickly as you'd expect it too, a good-corner trapper can own the competition. Luckily, you should have enough retro fun with it for that technique issue not to matter.   Surprisingly, the game is still a lot more balanced than it's previous pre-Pro incarnation, with various gameplay tweaks and character adjustment to make fighting a little fairer. An absolute monster in the initial release, Blanka has been made quicker while weakening his damage limits considerably. So while the hit and run ball tactics may have worked in repeated succession back in the day, it's going to take of powerful hits to gain a victory in the rebound. Other fighters have been strengthened and tightened up as well, with a healthy dose of move swapping between the EX and regular versions of the characters.   Graphics  Here's where the limitations of the PlayStation come into play. Fantastically gorgeous on the Dreamcast, the washed-out color palette on the PSX is the most obvious of compromises. With the vibrancy of the colors and crispness of the sprites receiving quite a debilitating hit. The result is a much more primitive (and darker) rendition of a purposely bright game, and may distract veterans of the game who expect a little bit more from their visuals.   Other cuts, most specifically in background and character animations were made too, transforming the fighting grounds into a far less kinetic experience for fans of atmospheric movement. Pleasingly though, all the character-specific taunts and win poses have been retained and the excellently drawn arenas are still some of the best among PlayStation Fighters. Watching Geese and Bison duke it out on Nakoruru's mountain is a sight to behold, even when downgraded to the PSOne's visuals.Not a perfect fighting game to be sure, Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 Pro is still one of the best titles to grace Sony's white machine in quite some time. Built on the proven Street Fighter engine and presented with scores of popular genre icons, there hasn't been a PSOne fighter this good since Alpha 3. Dreamcast vets and PlayStation 2 sequel owners however may want to stay away, as there's nothing here to entice those folk to go the downgrade route. Even still, Capcom vs. SNK is a great slugger and deserves our wholehearted recommendation for the new and uninitiated alike.", "date": "Aug 7, 2002"}
