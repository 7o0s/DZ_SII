I'm not the rockingest guy that ever rocked. In fact, I'm generally the person that's espousing a love for samplers, decks, synths and a 4/4 beat whenever possible. Why, then, am I reviewing Guitar Hero II? Because there's a kernel of rock god at the heart of everyone - no matter what kind of music they like, and Guitar Hero is the series that will bring it out. Formerly shy and retiring dudes who've no more made a double devil sign with their hands than bitten the head off a bat on stage will suddenly find their inner rock star forcing his way out it starts with a tapping of the foot and a nodding of the head, and it ends with crotch thrusting, exaggerated guitar movements, pained facial expressions and jumping up and down. There is no way to avoid this. Guitar Hero II will win you over, and you should definitely just let it. I did, and the Guitar Hero games are now among my favourite titles of all time.   Why? Guitar Hero II is the ultimate combination of form and function. The guitar peripheral is absolutely fundamental to the gameplay, giving the game an important and intuitive tactile element that - believe it or not - really fools you into thinking you're an axe-master. Hence the thrusting. In fact, we've been reliably informed by guitarists that there are quite a few tracks that are actually harder to play on Guitar Hero II on Expert difficulty level than on a real guitar. And one of those guys even uses a plectrum to play the game so we're inclined to believe him. Double-devil-sign.    Check out IGN's exclusive behind the scenes look at Guitar Hero II   We're getting ahead of ourselves though. For the Guitar Hero novice, Expert is at the end of a long road. You'll most likely work your way through on Medium (which only requires you to use four of the five fret buttons) and then Hard (which opens up the fifth button, requiring you to learn to move your hand up and down the fret board) before finally taking a crack at the RSI-inducing Expert. Getting used to the guitar is completely intuitive. Simply watch the fret board scroll towards you on screen and hold down the relevant note(s) in advance before strumming with the strum bar. It feels entirely natural, and it won't be long before you're nailing complex sections and really working the advanced mechanics such as hammer-ons and pull-offs, not to mention maximising your score through the Star Power system (which requires you to lift up the head of the guitar, or 'rock out', to go into double score mode).   We're also pleased to report that the learning curve is just about spot on in Guitar Hero II for 360. That's something we were concerned about because developer Harmonix really cranked up the difficulty between Guitar Hero I and II on PS2, giving veteran players more of a challenge, but making the game less accessible to new players on Hard and Expert. The good news is that the difficulty in Guitar Hero II on 360 climbs more organically, thanks to ten new songs which have been neatly slotted into a reshuffled Career mode. The revised order really does make for a smoother transition, even if it means that tracks like Rick Derringer's 'Rock N Roll, Hoochie Koo' sits in the Return of the Shred category.   Look at the fret board too long and when you look away the whole world is moving. See the world as Keith Richards sees it!  The new tracks also go a long way towards making Guitar Hero II's selection of music that much more memorable. To most Guitar Hero fans, the original PS2 game's soundtrack is superior to its sequel (what with gems like Boston's 'More Than a Feeling', David Bowie's 'Ziggy Stardust', Blue Oyster Cult's 'Godzilla', Jimi Hendrix's 'Spanish Castle Magic' and Black Sabbath's 'Iron Man' to name a few), but now that we can throw My Chemical Romance's 'Dead!', Pearl Jam's 'Life Wasted', Rick Derringer's 'Rock N Roll, Hoochie Koo', Iron Maiden's 'The Trooper' and Toadies' 'Possum Kingdom' (my personal pick for best new track) alongside the likes of Nirvana's 'Heart-Shaped Box', Wolf Mother's 'Woman', KISS' 'Strutter', Foo Fighters' 'Monkey Wrench', Guns N' Roses' 'Sweet Child O'Mine', Primus' 'John the Fisherman', Megadeth's 'Hangar 18' and Lynyrd Skynyrd's epic 'Free Bird', the track list suddenly feels much more fleshed out. For a more in-depth (though not particularly serious) look at the new tracks, check out our GH II rock-off.    As an added bonus, the move to 360 also means downloadable content! While nothing has been formally announced for Australia, it shouldn't be long after release that Guitar Hero freaks will have access to new song packs to download, which essentially means the game can stay fresh for as long as there's demand for new songs, not to mention the fact that the team at RedOctane can tailor release packs to particular genres. We honestly can't wait for new songs to be added to Marketplace, and we also have our fingers crossed that some of the legendary songs from the original game will come to the service, complete with the tweaked mechanics of GH II. That would certainly help overcome our initial disappointment that this release isn't a Guitar Hero 'best-of'.   If you've never played Guitar Hero before, there are a number of modes to get stuck into. The Career mode is obviously the meat of the game, seeing you move from venue to venue, moving through songs grouped in pre-determined sets and earning money that can be spent on bonus songs, guitars, characters and more. Need some help beating a particular section of Psychobilly Freakout on Expert? Pop out to the Practice mode and you can attempt anything from the entire song through to specific sections at a range of speeds. It's a good way to work out the best fingering techniques in a less hectic environment.   Where's that damn kid with my latte?  If you can get your hands on two guitars, the other must-play mode is Multiplayer. This is where the party appeal of Guitar Hero II really shines. There's nothing like getting together with some friends and some bevvies to rock out, either facing off against one another or playing cooperatively. And best of all, unlike the original Guitar Hero, you can mix up the skill levels, so a veteran player can play on Expert, while a novice tackles Easy.    As you'd expect, Guitar Hero II on 360 has a whole host of achievements to unlock. 50, in fact. These range from really basic challenges such as unlocking venues in the Career mode, through to super human acts such as the Yngwie Malmsteen Award for getting a thousand note streak, or the Guitarmaggedon Award for getting a five star rating on all tracks in Hard (the equivalent in Expert is the 'Start a Real Band Already' award). While there's no online play, you can strut your stuff on the world stage in a way, via the leader boards. Here you can check out how you compare to other players or friends around the world, either song by song, or based on overall points. Expect to be humbled.   Guitar Hero II has also evolved in a couple of other areas in the move to 360. The game looks great in high def (not that you'll look beyond the fret board all that often) with improved character models and lighting in the clubs. More importantly, however, the sound quality is better than ever. The new 5.1 mix is great, and the levels seem far more consistent than they were on PS2, where the relative loudness often jumped around a bit. One thing you should know, however, is that - like the PS2 versions - the vast majority of tracks included are not based off the 'Master Recording' - they're played by cover bands and as such vary in quality quite a bit. Thankfully an average rendition doesn't take too much away from the experience, and the vast majority are really solid, but it does make the songs that are based on Master Tracks stand out all the more.    Playing this game is often like looking into a mirror.  Perhaps the most immediately noticeable difference between the PS2 games and the 360 is the new guitar controller. Sorry SG fans, the new guitar is based on the Gibson X-plorer, which is both a blessing and a curse. Left-handed gamers will like the fact that the strap points have been designed for a more comfortable 'Lefty Flip', but for right handed players the jutting angles of the guitar can mean that your strumming arm isn't as comfortable as it could be. Other than that the controller works a treat although the fact that it's wired is a bit disappointing.  The beauty of Guitar Hero II is that its a must-play title for both hardcore gamers and just about everyone else. Its simplicity itself to get into, yet a serious challenge to master, and along the way youre taken on a rock journey from the 60s through to modern day, from laidback noodling to hard machine gun riffs and explosive solos. This is the game to bring out the inner rock god in everyone. Get it.Want to have your say about Guitar Hero II? Rock on over to the  Aussie forums.", "date": "Apr 3, 2007"}
