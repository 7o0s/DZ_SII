However, as we've seen over the progression of the DS thus far, some third party designers are having issues bringing their familiar control over to what's been hailed as the ~developer's system.~  We're excited to see that innovation is still in full force, as Ubisoft has teamed up with Taito to bring Lost Magic to American shores.  While it's great to be treated to an all new franchise on the DS - especially an import one - Lost Magic isn't without its flaws.  Combining real-time strategy elements with a role-playing game is hit and miss, offering a great mix of depth and variety in characters and strategy, but coming up a bit short in the overall feel.   For starters, Lost Magic is not an RPG.  It's an adventure RTS, similar to what you could expect from the turn-based hybrid of Advance Wars and Fire Emblem.  Players follow the story of Isaac, a boy with a rare ability to cast magical spells.  Given a special wand that has been passed down from generation to generation, Isaac embarks on a quest to find answers about his family, his birthright and his destiny.  The gameplay can best be described as a mix between the Pokemon series and Tao's Adventure for DS.  Players will go from battle to battle on a pre-determined path, waging war against enemy encampments.  Isaac's magic is the focus of the game, using the stylus to input hundreds of spell combinations.     When delivering magic, players will utilize the stylus and draw out symbols from a list shown on the top screen.  Based on how well the symbol is duplicated, a better result is yielded.  Drawing symbols is done on the fly, however, so players will have to balance speed and accuracy if they want to succeed.  As the game progresses, Isaac gains the ability to cast both two and three spells at the same time, thus adding an insane amount of possible abilities to the list.  Much like Pokemon, however, Isaac also has the ability to capture enemy monsters to add to his battalion.  These monsters can then be called into battle, leveled up and given items to increase their attributes.  Many monsters follow the Pokemon rules as well, utilizing elemental attacks and a balance of strengths and weaknesses to certain magic.  All in all, Lost Magic offers a ton of depth across the board.   While there's no shortage of battle elements to explore, the overall balance of the game is off.  Isaac's mana replenishes at a slow rate, and since every ability in the game is based on spell casting, players will have to work around his somewhat helpless control.  No mana means no attacking, no healing and no escape.  Plain and simple.  Aside from the direct control of Isaac, players also utilize RTS controls to maneuver their army.  This is done by clicking and dragging the stylus to circle units.  From there, it's as simple as tapping an area or enemy to point your troops in the right direction.  Control is far too basic, however, as only perfect circles can be drawn to select troops.  In addition to the basic selection, there's no way to pinpoint one specific character during the heat of a battle.  If an ally is near death, players will have to power up the healing spell and hope they click the fighter in need, rather than accidentally casting it on a nearby unit.  Games like the Warcraft series include portraits of characters for quick selection and unit management, and those abilities should be commonplace for any RTS.     Difficulty in unit control doesn't end there, however, as the artificial intelligence is amazingly basic in Lost Magic.  When selecting a destination, characters will walk in a direct line to that point.  There's no AI function for navigating around objects, so if a wall stands in the way of a unit's path they will walk in place until manual directions are given.  In fact, the control is complicated further, as units will no longer be selected once a command is given.  There's no real way to assign groups either, so once you issue a command the group is lost until circled again.     On a similar note, characters won't stop on their way to a destination, so if allied units are attacked en route they'll keep walking, allowing the enemy to attack them from behind until every last unit is lost.  This basic behavior also occurs when transitioning from unit to unit, as player-controlled units will often stop attacking once their enemy is defeated, rather than seeking out a nearby unit to continue battle with.  The entire real control scheme system feels very dated, and combining a complex casting system that takes full attention during battles only adds to the mayhem.   While there are obvious issues with the gameplay, not everything in Lost Magic is a total wash.  In fact, there are still tons of great moments to be had during both the single player campaign and the online multiplayer.  The campaign mode is relatively basic, allowing players to only make minor choices between battles.  Players can choose a route on a branching path, but it ultimately will lead to the same destination.  The battles are cleverly designed, however, adding some serious entertainment to the fights.  Each level can potentially include enemy spawners, healing crystals (that can be captured by either army a la the cities in Advance Wars), and special items.  In addition, the potential of capturing any enemy you face adds a huge element of strategy.  Having trouble beating a huge dragon?  Why not attack him to near-death and capture him as an ally!  The mix of so many battle elements really keeps the game fresh, though it can frustrate to an insanely high level as well, since multitasking has never been so deep on a portable.     Then there's the multiplayer.  One of the only third party games on DS to utilize the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, Lost Magic will surely be a hit for online gamers.  Fans will be happy to know that there's a ton of replay offered, as many gamers will have just as much fun playing person vs. person as they do against the amazingly difficult campaign missions.  Battles split into two different categories as well.  Players can opt to use either a pre-set of characters from the game with armies already made up, ensuring a totally balanced fight.  If you're a true fan of competitive gaming, however, you'll undoubtedly take the opposite route, using your own saved army from the single player game to wage war against other players across the globe.  This doesn't always add up to a fair fight, but there are definitely incentives to taking this route, as experience points gained in online play are saved and applied to the single player campaign.  Since the campaign mode is astonishingly tough, players have the option to use each other for ~training,~ fighting online to gain experience for their squad.  Not a bad deal.   While the gameplay is the obvious focus, Lost Magic won't be winning many people over in actual production value.  Graphically the game is weak, offering GBA art teamed with somewhat bland storyboards.  The art looks very generic, actually giving off the look of a wanna-be Japanese title rather than an actual import epic.  Magic effects are all 2D as well, and are very basic.  We'll continue to hope for a sequel that could rival the art of at least Golden Sun, but for now Taito has focused on delivering gameplay over visual appeal.  In addition, the audio presentation is barely above average, offering a total GBA presentation across the board.  Music can best be compared to downgraded Castlevania and Final Fantasy tunes, and the sound effects are simply generic.    So in a total grab-bag of quality, can we really recommend Lostmagic to DS fans out there?  It honestly depends on your preferences.  If youre a fan of the RTS genre, and have no problem overcoming some dated control mechanics, youd still have a ton of fun with Lostmagic.  For others that are on the fence, consider the highlights of our synopsis.  The control is give and take, the design is amazingly deep, and the experience is rewarding as long as you can get passed the frustration that will ensue from time to time.  The multiplayer is great, however, so if youre looking for another Wi-Fi title to dive into, this may be just what you need.  Its important to add, however, that we did experience lag during a few online matches, and actually had the game freeze up due to sprite overload while playing single player.  These moments were vary sparse, however, and we only comment to them to make sure gamers know what theyre getting when they decide whether or not to invest this much time and cash.  Is it innovative and entertaining?  Yes.  Is it a no-brainer for any fan of the DS?  Not at all.", "date": "Apr 28, 2006"}
