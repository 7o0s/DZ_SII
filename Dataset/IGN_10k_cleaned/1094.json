This year we get F1 2000 by EA and the upcoming Grand Prix 3 by Hasbro/Microprose.  F1WGP offers the supposedly realistic yet more friendly game for 'the rest of us.' F1WGP is a sequel to last year's Official F1 Racing title, which had a rather arcade style engine, but conveyed many aspects of Formula One well.  However, most sim racers didn't take it very seriously because of the less demanding (to diehards: ~arcade~) physics engine.  Upon starting the game, I was delighted to see the option of choosing a Direct3D T&L driver for my GeForce.  This means that the GeForce in my system could offload more work from the CPU to allow for more complex scenes to be rendered.  The result is a highly detailed, almost photographic Formula One world.  The colors are vivid and the cars are nicely detailed, complete with glossy, reflective paint schemes. The game actually runs pretty fast with all these settings pushed to the limit.  Obviously, your mileage may vary, especially because I'm using a Pentium 750 with the GeForce 256 SDR.  A few very cool graphics features stood out almost immediately. If the side mirrors are active, you see full rear reflections in them, regardless of what camera angle you are seeing the car from, either live or in replay mode.  This really adds to the realistic look.  There are a couple of in-car views worth pointing out: the in-helmet cam and the regular driver cam.  Both feature optional head panning to look into the corners and show you holding the steering wheel. The in-helmet camera limits you to about half the screen horizontally, and tints everything you do see a darker blue.  It may be somewhat more realistic than a full-screen view, but it remains to be seen how many people want to get that immersed in the experience.  There's a wide array of trackside, helicopter, satellite, static and customizable views as well.  The tracks are modeled very well, with very detailed curbing models complete with rubber streaks where tires regularly cross over them.  Just trying to put my front wheel over the rubber streak on the curb is a great deal of fun!  Weather conditions are also modeled, complete with vapor rooster tails flying up from behind the cars.  Unfortunately, rather than create a foggy spray, the flumes look more like a series of bright white puffs, which detracts from the way rain racing really looks.  The sound in the game is above average, particularly from inside the cars, where each of the F1 engines has its own distinct note, and there is both a buzzing and a high pitched whine, but more of a buzz than a whine.  There isn't much in the way of downshifting sounds, regrettably, so F1 2000 wins in that contest.  Tire squeal is present when you corner too hard or lock up or spin your tires.    No annoying announcers clutter up the game, but you do get your crew chief, who in general stays pretty quiet except when you downshift too fast.  He really hates that and let's you know immediately!   And if you toggle a pit request he grudgingly says, ~Okay, okay! We'll wait for you~ as if you've just interrupted the 24-hour Blossom Marathon on NBC.  Force Feedback devices are supported, and you can tune a few individual effects, but the one thing that nearly killed the game for me was the almost complete absence of wheel resistance, even when you set the ~FF cornering resistance~ slider to maximum.  I toggled my control panel applet for the Force RS to make the steering resistance always on and it solved the problem and saved the game from being an embarrassingly unrealistic experience.  It also surprisingly still let the other force feedback effects come through, so I got everything I wanted from the control department.  Again, your mileage may vary, but it would have been very hard to stay motivated to complete the review if I couldn't get some steering resistance in my wheel.  I really need to feel like the car wants to straighten out when I'm exiting the corners, and without steering resistance, the game just feels like one of those beat-up Sega Daytona coin-ops where the wheel motors have gone slack! You definitely feel like the car wants to jump out of control and you involuntarily squeeze the wheel a little harder to keep it from doing so.  The main modes of play are nothing new, revolving around various length single player races in Arcade or Simulation mode as well as a full Championship season using the 1999 schedule.  All the real-life drivers are selectable and you place your own name (saved in one of many user profiles you may create) in one of the real driver's shoes.  Because this is based upon last year's season, you'll find CART champion Alex Zanardi still at Williams.   Of course, since you're in last year's schedule, you get to drive that 2-faced BAR car if you want to be Villeneuve, or a Buzzin Hornets yellow Jordan (instead of Benson and Hedges).  The physics model is at the same time easier and harder to get a handle on than its main competition, F1 2000 by EA.  It's easier in the sense that it requires much more carelessness to get the car sideways.  Wheelspin coming out of slow corners is not as easy to induce, and as long as your brake bias is not insanely set towards the rear, you won't slide sideways under braking.  The car does tend to push a lot into and through corners if you haven't braked well, and you can't just goose the throttle to zip from understeer to oversteer.  If you do so, you'll just push harder.  (I can see the GPL fanatics now leaving this review en masse).  Also, when you do get all four wheels off the track, regardless of the angle, you're going to do a half-spin sideways.  This is clearly a 'canned' spin.  Getting two wheels off is a situation you can recover from, though.    Braking is hell, as there seems to be no use whatsoever to three quarters of a brake pedal travel.  Just squeeze half an inch and you're going to lock up the brakes.  Fortunately, the brakes are very powerful just short of this level and if you learn to just squeeze very gently on the brakes you can be very smooth and not lock up the brakes at all, yet slow down at a frightening rate, just like you'd expect.  Still, pedal sensitivity settings are high on my list of ~to be patched~ items.  The game does provide an excellent sense of speed and the act of high speed cornering is terrifyingly fast.  I have not seen an F1 game before that seems to require such a high degree of faith while cornering.   It just seems unreal to me that I can keep my pedal on the floor through some high speed sweepers and yet if driven properly, the car sticks to the ground.  It looks and feels very realistic, and reminds me of my karting and on-track experiences where it really takes sheer will to trust the car and the track.  However, that increased grip borders on arcade physics, especially when you go through a sweeper such as the one in turn 3 in France.  You have to downshift and be patient with the throttle in F12K.  In F1WGP you can pretty much stand on the gas and yell ~wheeee!~  Also, the car isn't as tossable as it needs to be.  It corners like it's on a rail, such as the above, or it pushes like a pig with wheels locked and squealing.  There is a fine line in between, and little room for feeling the car begin to slip away from you to make the minor corrections to keep the car hanging on.  Your first indication of something gone wrong is generally tire squeal and smoke in your mirrors.  The only thing you can do then is slow down and hope you stay on the track.  It's true that real F1 cars are known to be very darty and difficult to drive, requiring an almost inhuman instinct for sensing what the car is doing it just before it actually does it, so perhaps in that regard F1WGP is more accurate than the more gradual and catchable F12K.  But these are ultimately games we are supposed to be able to 'feel' so perhaps even if F1WGP is more realistic here, it provides a less interesting driving model overall.  I have to add one more note here.  I knew something was a little fishy with the F1WGP physics model when, at a dead stop with the car in neutral, the car began slowly floating sideways across the track!   Um...okay, moving on, then!  The arcade mode lets you corner at even more insane speeds, but still offers different skill levels so it can be every bit as tough to win at as simulation mode.  This might be a rush for some, but the simulation mode is where the meat of the game lives.    The AI cars seem fairly intelligent.  The backmarkers are perhaps TOO quick to move over and let you by (which can be quite dangerous!).  Generally the cars avoid contact, and err on the side of caution if they are behind you and aren't sure what you're going to do.  Not that they don't screw up, though.  They seem to have no clue what the yellow flag is for, and you can count on being knocked senseless even several seconds after spinning to a stop near the middle of the road.   They also often can't make up their mind which side of the road they should take and often swerve into your side of the track just as you've gunned it to get by.  The resulting collisions make for interesting replay, but are frustrating.  Thankfully that's what the ~Undo key~ is for (keep reading, this is a teaser).  The big problem with the gameplay here is that the AI cars qualify and race ridiculously fast at some tracks, particularly when you actually exit the track and let the game generate the times.  I noted in a race at Japan: I had built up a big lead running 1:52 lap times, and when I exited the game to up the difficulty level, it showed that everyone else began running low 1:30's the instant I left!  That this also happens during qualifying makes this session a waste of time as the AI will just blow your doors off at some tracks after you've done your scheduled 12 laps!  So, what did I mean with the ~Undo~ comment?  Simply this.  At any time, in any session, you can hit Backspace to bring up the replay menu.  It will hold an entire race and is capable of saving that entire race.  If you miss your braking point and slide into the weeds, or you tangle with a particularly stupid AI car and get thrown off the track, just hit Backspace, rewind the tape, make sure you're in cockpit view and select a little steering wheel icon on the control bar.  Instantly you are driving beginning at that point.  Now you can get that braking zone right or anticipate the stupidity of an AI driver.  Another fine use for this is testing a setup.  If you're trying to get a great practice lap in and you blow a turn, just back up and try it again.  You can try to piece together the perfect lap and work on tougher sections of the course.  This is a huge asset to the game, but of course it's also a liability as it takes away some of the tension from driving on the limit.  If you know you can take anything back, it changes your mentality, focus and adrenalin.  However, in any race or qualifying session (as opposed to free practice), only the laps completed WITHOUT using this feature count towards fast laps, so they are useful reference points, but that's all.  Also, the ~try again~ feature is disabled in championship mode, so you can get your adrenalin back by driving in that mode and taking your lumps.  Because you can save any portion of these replays, you can create saved scenarios and try them regularly or send them to friends, so if you come back and pass two cars for the win on the final lap (as if that ever happens in F1 anymore!), you can save that as a scenario and challenge your pals to do the same.  There are various other options in the game I won't go into in depth here to avoid repeating a feature list, but almost everything is customizable, from the number of opponents, to their quality, the kind of weather, different skill levels and more.  You can also alter the rate of wear and tear on the car so you have to pit at least once even in shorter races.  Ultimately, this is the F1 simulation for 'normal' people who want the thrills of F1 without the steep learning curve of more hardcore simulations.  The feature set ensures that these users will enjoy racing, while the graphics are dazzlingly good, particularly on cutting edge hardware.  The cost of all this is that the car is harder to 'feel' and the driving model feels more canned, making car control easier than it really is in several ways.  Nonetheless, the game will get a fair amount of my time along with F1 2000 while I wait to see what Geoff Crammond and Co. at Hasbro come up with in Grand Prix 3.  One thing is for sure, though:  we are far better off in terms of the quality of the released F1 simulations than we have been in recent years, so there should be a game for everyone.  -- Randy Magruder  Comment on this story", "date": "Jul 12, 2000"}
