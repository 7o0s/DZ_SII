Having won 112 professional games, seven division titles and the 1976 Super Bowl (as coach of the Oakland Raiders) Madden has gone on to earn 11 Emmy awards and in 1994 received a record high $32 million four year contract with Fox as a football analyst.  Now, after the release of several versions of his steadfastly endorsed and highly touted Madden NFL series of electronic football games, it seems Mr. Madden and his astute team of EA Sports developers, should be a shoe-in for the 2001 Super Bowl championship.   Presentation  Last year Madden started with some slammin' rap tunes to bring a nice urban hip-hop feel to the presentation of the sport.  EA has always possessed a knack for this type of thing, as anyone can remember hearing all the great tracks EA gurus chose for the openings of the FIFA titles as well.  This year, EA has once again opted for the rap backdrop and has used California based artists to come up with proprietary lyrical licks to get players 'Hyped to Hut'!   I personally dug the opening track from last year a bit more, but this version is growing on me with each listening.  After all the cut scenes of football slams, Rams and slow jams, you are whisked away to a brightly colored interface that is all too easy to navigate.  The front end of Madden NFL 2001 is snappy and Bears the minimalist load times.  In fact, this new interface is somewhat reminiscent of the one we saw in use, for PS2 Madden, at this year's E3.  The bottom line is it works well, is easy to read and (most importantly) is easy to navigate.   With the host of modes and modifications that one can put into play with this title, a snappy interface is a great thing to have in place.  For example, modes of play include Exhibition, Season, Two-Minute Drill, Franchise, Custom League, Tournament, Practice and Situation.  That amounts to eight modes of play, all with different emphasis.  Want to manage your team for a season? Play the Franchise Mode, or take those slackers out on the field for some much-needed practice.  Then it's off to the Two-Minute drill...um...drills.  Let me tell you this right now, both the Practice and Two-Minute Drill modes will prove to have been time well spent.  But I will get more into that in my discussion of Madden's gameplay.   Gameplay Dispensing with the pleasantries and jumping right into issue numero uno, the frame rate in this game is brisk and stable.  The one key element, that caused the Madden franchise to loose some ground with consumers, besides the 1996 ~no show~ on PlayStation, was the fact that-for some strange reason-the folks over at EA could never seem to shake the shaky frame-rate bug.  Well that is all a thing of the past here folks!  Whether it is the running game, the passing game, Defense or Offense, the frame rate in Madden NFL 2001 is just what it always should have been-smooth.   Moreover, with all of the other things EA has gotten right, this time around, the overall immersiveness into the game of 'cyber-football' is further solidified.  For example, they have included the NFL Coaches Club, which offers coaching strategies and criticism throughout the game.  And then there is the aforementioned Practice Mode and Two-Minute Drill.  Whether you are a Madden newbie or a veteran, thumb busting armchair Quarterback, anyone can benefit and learn from these two, well implemented, modes.   The practice mode allows the player to choose the offensive sets and plays as well as the defensive alignment and formations.  Also configurable is whether or not each play will commence from a static scrimmage line, or whether there is even a defensive unit on the field or not.  The benefit here is that you will find the engine in this game does a nice job of showing just how varied the results, of running the same play, can be.   For example, let's say you choose a running play out of the Pro-Formation and select a toss to your halfback.  At the line of scrimmage you have the option to move the full back from his split-back position, up to the line.  The play results will differ on each snap of the ball-as the fullback, when moved to the line, will more readily pick up the block on the outside Linebacker.  But no matter how many times you run the play, with the exact same defensive set in place, you will gain varying amounts of yardage and see the play unfold many different ways.  This is because the snap count may be different, and the fact those defensive and offensive Linemen actually get off the snap count at different microseconds of time.  With the Defense employing a variety of blocks, swim maneuvers and other close quarter techniques, penetration into the backfield may turn up too slowly, too rapidly or favorably.  Thus, it is up to the player controlling the runner to read and react to what does or does not unfold after the snap.  I found this a very engrossing way to learn newer plays, and develop more techniques to adjust to the movement of the ball more intuitively.  But the punch line here folks is that if the game were not as rich and balanced as it is, this would not work well, nor would it be a benefit.  In Madden NFL 2001 it certainly is.   Same thing goes here for the Two-Minute Drill.  Not only do you get the chance to simulate the pressure of having only 120 seconds to find victory, but the experience is further embellished with the inclusion of bonus points-and play bonuses that tabulate a score at the end of the Two-Minute session-with the highest possible score being 20,000.  So if you gain a six yard run on your first touch of the ball with  2:00 showing on the clock, you may get 100 points for the effort.  Then, collectively, as your team pulls things out, and you get closer the endzone, the CPU tabulates your feats and ultimately develops an aggregate score.  You will get big numbers if you find yourself in a fourth and long situation and pull out the first down.  This amounts to simply terrific training and loads of competitive fun. Other modes that we are accustomed to are handled in regular fashion, with the inclusion of User Profiles to track an individual's accomplishments in memory.  Once out on the field, the gameplay enhancements of Madden continue to shine.   Returning this year is Route-based Passing, allowing for the leading of receivers, Directional (Analog) Passing and the classic Icon-based method.  Trying all of the methods, I found that Route-based Passing offered the greatest level of on-the-fly flexibility, but does require some adjustment, as additional buttons presses (other than the receiver icon) are required to make it effective.  Overall I played the game using the default passing method, in conjunction with Hot Routes.   Hot Routes are routes that the Quarterback (you the player) designates to a specific receiver or receivers-while actually at the line of scrimmage.  When you factor in that there are at least six available audibles to choose from, in addition to simply changing a receiver's route, you can easily see how the offensive play calling and execution has been given the real deal NFL Pro treatment here.   Here is a typical scenario:   You Single Back set, and directional pad right twice to install four receivers in the interface screen.  As such, and based upon the team you are playing with, you will have either four Wideouts or three and a running back.  You have called on All Streaks play on 3rd  and 11.  The Defense lines up in a Nickle formation and they are showing a center blitz, as you are on their 30-yard line.  Your decide to audible, but don't thin that anything in your arsenal will truly exploit the coverage.  So you hit theTriangle button, then hit R1 (for one of your receivers) and then press Left on the D-Pad.  You have just told the receiver on the inside right of your spread to go up and cut across the middle.  If you are right, the middle should be open, because of the center blitz you see coming.  Your other receivers should draw the D-backs out of the area you are hoping is already soft.  The snap comes, the blitz too comes, and you find yourself ready to pee on yourself because Curtis Martin has just made his cut and is three steps ahead of the guy trying to run him down.  You fire the pass low and hard, by holding the button down, and the ball slams into this chest just as he turns and backpedals-in reaction to the fact that the pass was slightly behind him.  He completes the 180 and goes another three yards before the D-back from the far-left side has leveled himself straight out to flatten your receiver.  You have just gained 15 yards, under adverse circumstances, because you were allowed (by this great engine and interface) to play an entirely active role in the game. Think about that for a moment, you never even had to audile!  Speaking of audibles...here's a tip:  I always set all of my offensive audibles from the same offensive set.  This way, when you call one, your opponent can't tell which one of the six plays you have called.  Sneaky huh?  You bet!  Some of the same ideas apply here on Defense, in terms of the flexibility at the line.  Now you can not only shift your D-line to adjust to offensive overloads, but you can adjust your secondary to react to run and pass coverages as well.  You can shift into and out of Bump and run coverage, loose coverage and Read and React pass and run coverages also.  There is also a new kicking meter, and button interface, that allows for trajectory height influence on the ball.  These types of gameplay enhancements really excite me because EA Sports has showed how innovative they really are in terms of making the gameplay experience more tactile and cerebrally involving in the end.  Thanks EA for not insulting our intelligence with arcade-like controls and limited playability.  Of importance are also the plays themselves.  Bouncing around from city to city I found the playbooks did 'indeed' vary.  While some of the same sets and formations may be fond from team-to-team, the actual plays themselves showed variety and difference, based upon each teams areas of strength and weakness.  This even showed up well when playing against the CPU, in almost all instances.  While you, the player, can make use of a playbook from another team, and can even go as far as to include some custom designed plays in that profile, the CPU uses the default book for each team.  So you can expect to see Jerome Bettis coming out of the backfield on short routes and getting the ball frequently against virtually any team on the other side of the ball.  However, I did find it odd that, in a game played during a thunderstorm the Steelers played the passing game way too much for my liking.  When you have a Bettis on the ground, and the ball is 'slippery when wet' why would you choose to play a passing game?  Strange but only one of a few slight issues I have with this game.  The CPU's defensive coverage is not retarded like some games of the past.  They also no longer shuffle their legs like Riverdance dancers, just for the show of it all.  Defensive backs and safeties creep, plug and shoot gaps much more realistically than in the past.  In addition, their pursuit angles have been improved and make busting through the backfield a bit more work, without seeming hard or frustrating.  This is where all the neatness of jukes, spins, hurdles and powering through wrap tackles takes the game's interaction with the user even further.  While these are not new attributes, they are refined and balanced so well-that from the time you call the play until the last power surge or dive for a tackle-you feel like you are truly a part of the outcome of your games.  This is another thing that makes Madden NFL 2001 so engrossing to play and extends the replay value as well-ad infinitum.  Graphics  The graphics of Madden NFL 2001 surpass even that of NCAA 2001.  These are the best-modeled Madden players to date, with the exception of the PS2 version that is forthcoming.  The player models are proportionate, with better textures and exhibit refined field-to-player physics.  You have weather effects, with lightening, rain, shine and snow.  You name it!  Players animate very well and the collision aspects of the game are finely tuned.  Other animations include a wide variety of celebrations, which can also be user controlled-for more player involvement.  There is a player creation mode that allows you to build custom players.  You can also change the team's uniforms and create a custom league-if those kinds of things are your bent.  Use of the analog control sticks to move around your polygonal players is very clean and very responsive.  In the past, this has been an issue for Madden, as it many times felt a bit floaty and slippery.  That is no longer.  Because melding the aspects of gameplay with animation and graphics has gotten serious attention, with outstanding results. From the on-screen yardage markers, to the variable camera views and pre-snap views, including the 'over the receiver's shoulder' peek, the game is tight and on point.  What else can I say?  The game is a PS1 marvel of football beauty in many areas.  Wanna' see your receiver's routes at the line? It is there, if you want!  Wanna'observe the game and just coach?  You got that too!  Wanna' build plays, create a team, add yourself to the lineup or even watch the CPU play itself?  It can do all that and more.  EA is commended, at least by this reviewer, for doing an ace bang-up job of tuning this game like I like my scrambled eggs-'just ever so'.  Visually clean and tactually sound.  Sound The sound in Madden iterations of football has waxed and waned over the years.  While never just plain old 'bad' at anytime, I have found that certain areas could have used more attention and more refinement.  NCAA 2001 is the epitome of how a football game on PS1 should sound.  Well Madden NFL 2001 does a nice job of upping the ante in the area of sound.  The music, menu cues, in-game sounds and crowd noise are all quality.  I don't find that the crowd is nearly as dynamic in Madden as it is in NCAA, but pro fans are quite the overall junkies that their college counterparts are.  So maybe EA will give me a small nod for making up a good excuse...I mean a good reason for the differences in the crowd sounds.  That being only quibble number two, you may be wondering what I actually find wrong with this game?  The answer is not much.  To pick this game apart, by making needless and inaccurate comparisons to anything other than PS1 football titles would be...as the Borg say...~futile.~  Game calls and color commentary comes courtesy of John Madden and Pat Sumerall.  Even this has gotten marginally better than years past.  Madden's quips are still somewhat limited, but are of newer variety.  Pads and helmets have a sound with impact without being harsh or annoying to the old ear flaps.  Pound for pound good damn sound!  If you want to get into the huddle and Under the Helmet of real NFL football, head over to NFL.com. With live chats, real-time audio and interactive polls, you can experience NFL action like never before. One will be hard pressed to find another football game, of the professional variety that will give the player such a profound playing experience as Madden NFL 2001.  We'll see how NFL GameDay 2001 shakes down in a few days.  But certainly, they have their work cut out for them, especially when going up against this 800 pound gorilla of a game.I will go as far as to say that I have never played a game of football, that I have enjoyed this much, since the first time I played NFL2k (before realizing that I could not run the ball).  Other than that initial and very brief experience of football euphoria, Madden '92 was the last best football game on a console.  Oh!  And there was the 3DO version which was hippity-hype too!Then you have to factor in the Madden cards-a whole new game within a game where you actually have to earn them, along with your season statistics.  Add in the fact that you can use them to power-up your team or players in certain areas and conditions, you can just get plumb silly on playing this game over and over again.  There is so much, in such a small package, and the NFL experience really does com alive with this game.PlayStation owners should rejoice that EA Sports has labored so well and hard to come up with this stellar and inevitably award-winning football title.  From the first boot-up to the first Superbowl Championship celebration, Madden NFL 2001 will dig its cleat into your heart and feels like a score every time!", "date": "Aug 15, 2000"}
