{"name": "Tarzan", "name_review": "Disney's Tarzan", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/15/disneys-tarzan", "text": "Well, it's about time Nintendo 64 got a decent old-style side-scrolling platformer, even if it is a ~port~ of a PlayStation original. Disney's Tarzan is the game we're referring to, of course, and while it comes to us courtesy of publisher Activision (which has traditionally shelled out, shall we say, less than spectacular ports in the past), luckily this isn't the case at all for this baby. Rather, famed UK development house Eurocom (those wacky Brits! -- we like saying that.) has once again delivered a finely tuned console-to-console transition that, believe it or not, actually outshines the PlayStation original in some respects. At the same time though, the major problem that put a damper on the 32-bit version's reputation has returned to weigh on Nintendo 64 owner's shoulders -- the game is simply too easy.  Features  2-1/2D style. 13 gorgeous jungle levels to explore. 12 bonus levels. More than a dozen Tarzan moves, including everything from tree-surfing to riding animals. Grow from young to adult Tarzan throughout the course of the game. Storyline that closely follows the feature film.   Gameplay The Nintendo 64 version of Tarzan, like the PlayStation one, follows the storyline of the feature film (of the same name, of course) to a tee. Tarzan, like so many children, is raised to adulthood by apes. One day while swinging along some trees and chatting up a storm with the local baboons, Tarzan comes across a visiting group of other humans, who have traveled to his excluded island to conduct some tests. It isn't long before the ape man falls head over heels in love with the lead female role and the adventure gets all out of whack from there. While the PlayStation version of the game offered gamers FMV cut-snippets of select scenes in the movie, the Nintendo 64 incarnation obviously does not, opting to instead dazzle us with some static images. Eh, what can you do?  But enough about storyline. You'd rather read about the guts of the game, so let us jump right into them. Tarzan is what we in the industry call a 2 1/2D platformer. If you're privy to the term, you're probably also aware of other games that employ this style, namely Pandemonium and Clockwork Knight, Tomba! and Yoshi's Story 64. Basically, 2 1/2D is a confusing way of stating that the game plays like a 2D platformer, but features 3D polygonal graphics and realistic backdrops. All of this good stuff works to give the impression that the action is taking place in 3D, but it isn't -- you're on a set path.  Disney's Tarzan N64 is as good as 2 1/2D comes. Players control ape boy and his friends through 13 unique levels and 12 bonus missions. The action is pretty straightforward as far as platformers go. Tarzan runs from left to right and collects items, but he's also capable of a dozen or so unique moves from vine-swinging to knifing, swimming, tree-surfing and bouncing off animals to gain access to higher level areas. Hardcore platformer fanatics will recognize all of these traits as the norm. Control is extremely tight. Monkey man is manipulated with the analog stick, A jumps, B throws fruit, Z-trigger makes our hero pound on the ground (which works to find secret areas) and the C buttons are utilized for various knife-using and fruit throwing extras.   Level design ties in with the movie closely, highlighting everything from the jungle battles to fighting on the ship in the sea as Tarzan grows from child to adult. The main objective in each stage is, quite simply, to make it to the end. Then we have secondary objectives like collecting tokens, letters (to spell Tarzan) and bonus mission maps. Along the way Tarzan will have to fight off monkeys with fruit, do some tree surfing, swimming, vine-swinging and even do battle with the occasional boss. There are three levels of difficult ranging from easy to hard and you'd be wise to skip the simple stuff right off the bat as you won't gain access to the whole adventure unless you take the difficult route.   Tarzan is fun. In fact, it's downright neato -- and nostalgic. It controls wonderfully, features a good selection of items to collect and loads of variation in levels and actions. But it's way too darn short to really offer anything more than an afternoon well spent. Even on the most difficult setting, the adventure can be ripped through in a matter of hours and seeing as how there is no single-player mode to be found, well, we're left with a completely wrapped up adventure and $50 poorer for the whole ordeal. Obviously Activision is aiming this one at a younger audience and it's perfectly well-suited for such a demographic, but older gamers and those even remotely skilled in the art of platforming are going to have no problem whatsoever ending Tarzan's quest.  Graphics If you've ever had a go with the PlayStation version of Tarzan, you've already got an accurate idea of what to expect visually with the Nintendo 64 port. We use the letters p-o-r-t, after all, because it is one, and as such there's not much new in the way of innovation here. Tarzan looks a bit more colorful and otherwise it stacks up against its PlayStation predecessor in every graphical way from framerate to layout (though animation seems a bit better in the 32-bit original). The FMV sequences are gone and replaced by stand-alone static images and that's our biggest visual difference.  For those of you who've not yet seen Tarzan (in any form) in action, let us say that it's quite the sight to behold. Think of the animated feature film. Voila. It really looks that good. Character design is spot on, but it's really the detailed, cartoony 3D polygonal backdrops that Tarzan progresses that make this adventure such a graphical treat. Filling these rich environments are animated tree vines and decidedly cheery enemies that fail to frighten regardless of how big and menacing the fruit they might be carrying is.  Sound The game boasts some crisp ~midi~ renditions of the music from the movie, including jungle-esque background noise intermixed with happy flutes and generally cheerful samples. There are various grunts and ouches from ape boy, and quick sound-alike snippets like, ~This is going to be useful~ when Tarzan picks up a handy item or, ~Hey Turk!~ when he happens to run into the annoying little monkey. We've got bird screeches, tiger growls, monkey noises (what, exactly, do monkeys make sound-wise?) and the like -- all perfectly fitting of a Disney adventure, of course. Disney's Tarzan is a fun little 2 1/2D platformer in every way. Those aching for a side-scroller of any kind can look to this game for relief. It plays great, featuring tight control and lots of variation in level layout, objectives and actions. And it's breathtakingly beautiful, boasting rich detailed graphics that mimic the animated feature film as closely as possible. Nintendo 64 owners can rest easy with the knowledge that UK developer Eurocom has brought this puppy over in fine, sparkling form, only sacrificing the FMV story sequences with the transition. The main problem? Like the PlayStation game, Tarzan N64 is way, way too short to really appeal to seasoned Nintendo 64 owners and platform junkies alike. With only 13 levels that can be ripped through in hours (even on hard), it's far to easy to make good on a $50 purchase.Recommended for the younger audience and those who are willing to forgive an extremely short, simple quest in favor of a fun-filled few hours. And if nothing else, a rental is a must for platformer fans and Tarzan admirers alike.", "date": "Feb 15, 2000"}
