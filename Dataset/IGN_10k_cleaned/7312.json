Vivendi is releasing a console game that chronicles the events following the film, playing ~what if?~ with the seemingly real-deal death of Tony Montana in the final minutes. Hip-hop stars still refer to the flick as gospel. And now Disney's Starwave label is publishing a mobile game based on the rise of Tony Montana.   You likely wonder how the sanitized mobile platform can contain the larger-than-life personality of Tony Montana, deliriously over-acted by Al Pacino. The surprise is that with the exception of no blood, blow, or cursing, the spirit of the movie is alive and well in the mobile adventure. There are still point blank shotgun blasts, criminal kingpins are assassinated, and drive-by shootings terrorize the streets of Miami. At the end of a successful mission, you even hear Pacino rants ~I'm Tony Montana!~ like he's yelling through a mouthful of bagel.   The Rise of Tony Montana, as the game is sub-titled, doesn't follow the movie plot beat for beat. Instead, developer G5 Mobile pulls back the curtain on Tony's ascension through the ranks, clawing his way to the top by putting a bullet through the head of everybody that stands in his way.   The game employs two types of alternating sequences: on-foot shooting and driving. And G5 was smart enough to actually not even put you behind the wheel in those driving scenes. You're simply the passenger, shooting up the neighborhood, picking up shipments, and directing the driver to run over gunmen on the sidewalks by inputting number sequences before the target passes you by. When a black car from a rival gangster pulls up alongside of you, for example, you only have a couple seconds to jam on a series of numbers to open fire on the vehicle and make it explode. There is no shortage of carnage, but it is bloodless mayhem, so that likely helped the game squeeze through the normally sensitive carriers. (Mob and drug references are usually one-way tickets to rejection.)   The on-foot scenes use an isometric view to follow Tony through mansions and clubs, using all of his favorite tools to eliminate his enemies. You begin the game with a chainsaw, but soon move up to a shotgun, an Uzi, and finally an M-16. Each weapon has its strong suit. The chainsaw rips through close-range enemies while Tony pulls a 360 with the Uzi, dropping everybody within range, but you're vulnerable when your back is turned. Tony can pick up special icons that let him bust loose with a spinning chainsaw attack. If you run up on an enemy and hit the attack button Tony rolls under them and pops up on the other side, initiating his attack. The furniture in these interiors hide extra ammo, bullets, and money -- but the higher the difficulty, the fewer power-ups you uncover.   Elvira figures into Tony's rise, too. Not only must you complete a car race to win her heart, but you must also indulge in a little high-stakes blackjack to impress this less-than-virtuous maiden. The blackjack game feels tacked-on and unnecessary, though. Some players might think it's a value addition, but with so little personality at the table, it seems out of place.   I tested Scarface on a LG VX8300 -- a very capable handset with a bright screen. The game opens with a great theme before settling into sporadic sound effects and digitized speech. The visuals are quite good -- Tony has several animations during his gun-toting on-foot missions. The Miami streets have a solid amount of detail, although the number of car models is very limited.   Scarface: The Rise of Tony Montana was a very pleasant surprise this week. So many licensed games fail to capture the personality of their source material, but G5 Mobile and Starwave have done a bang-up job creating a pocket Tony Montana simulator. The game isn't terribly deep, but the action is both fast and furious, and keeps you glued while it lasts, save for the blackjack mini-game. Do yourself a favor, though, and don't play it on the easiest difficulty -- there's not much challenge. Try it on medium so Tony's rise isn't so meteoric.", "date": "Oct 4, 2006"}
