Sometimes you can make it look really good and get away with mediocre gameplay, but a franchise doesn't get that luxury too often. Other times, you can have an average-looking game with great play value, but the demand often favors bells and whistles. With shooters being such a competitive market, and with increasing competition on the console side, a dev house really has to bust its butt to get some footing and hold onto it.   Enter Bet on Soldier: Blood Sport, created by Kylotonn, a Parisian developer previously known for Iron Storm, from which BoS draws inspiration here and there. There's none of the sniper aggravation, though, and the physics engine and character models have been completely overhauled. However, the normal mapping on the character models carries over the ~plastic action figure~ we've seen before, with an apparent layer of sweat that makes everyone gleam at close range. Overall, though, BoS is a good-looking game, with some fairly subtle light bloom, huge zones, and detailed terrain. Death is also gruesome, which may be good or bad depending on your tastes. The splatters of blood and the ragdoll death animations will probably be an acquired taste, but it's a taste most of us shooter fans have gotten used to by now. BoS is a pretty chunky game, in fact, but there's no dismemberment, just sprays of blood and falling bodies.   The plot is a little hard to discern, but it involves, as far as I could tell, a mercenary whose family was killed. He also barely escaped death and has entered into the Bet on Soldier global competition, which combines one-on-one matches with standard shooter gameplay. At the beginning of the mission, you choose your gear, your mercenaries, and which BoS competitors you want to fight, but there's also a war of some kind going on -- you'll have objectives strewn out through the mostly linear zones, where you must destroy certain targets or obtain items. You'll typically also have an engineer with you, who can repair your armor indefinitely and for free (minus your shield), but you'll typically also have to keep him alive to open certain doors, a matter complicated by the fact that he doesn't have much firepower or armor. In practice, his weaknesses are never really a problem, mostly because of how powerful your character will be.   BoS departs from standard shooter gameplay by rewarding you money for each enemy soldier you kill, and differing amounts for how you kill them. Headshots get bonuses, as do kills from exploding barrels (which are, sadly, sprinkled liberally throughout the game and even used by the enemy for cover, on occasion). There are no health packs or ammo. You can't pick up or take an enemy's weapon. Whatever weapons you go into the mission with are what you must stick to, which sucks, frankly, because there's never a clear indication of what you'll need, and your options are typically rock-paper-scissors anyway.   For example, only certain, weaker weapons can be used with a shield, and the heavy weapons disallow having a shield in the first place. Different tiers of the same weapon type will include descriptions like ~increased accuracy~ or ~increased ammunition,~ with it unclear if the last tier has both or just the difference noted in the menu. There is no damage description here either, so a more expensive shotgun might be more powerful than its cheaper brethren, or it may only have that increased clip. Or increased accuracy. Or both. It's hard to tell.     At any rate, the engineer will repair you with his repair tool, even while you're fighting, which is handy (although you will want to stay still for him). He can't repair your shield for some reason, but that will quickly become pocket change. The only thing you'll really need to keep an eye on is your ammo. Loading a new magazine means losing the remaining rounds in the old one, which is an irritation when you need to buy more mags -- your current mag will need to be pretty much empty for this process to be cost effective, because you'll want to get rid of it to maximize how many rounds you have. Additionally, grenades are a relatively expensive investment. It takes $60 to completely repair a shield, but it will cost you $200 to buy a single basic grenade.    However, since enemies typically run away from a 'nade, and the throwing mechanism isn't that great, you won't be using these much anyway. You get an audio cue that beeps an increasing pitch, but nothing visual to indicate how long you should cook the grenade before tossing it. I think I prefer having either no indication at all (but knowing how many seconds I need), or having a meter on the target reticule. Either way, you can't throw them very far or very high, they're expensive, and there are typically enough exploding barrels in the vicinity to make your own explosives redundant anyway.   The barrel mechanic is actually kind of neat, for its part. It doesn't explode right away, instead spraying a burst of flame for a few seconds (or acid, or hallucinogenic gas), and I got some enjoyment from figuring out how to finesse the timing for maximum impact. There are also canisters and gas tanks that will fly around when shot at, although they're a little unpredictable. The enemy may also use these devices against you, so you'll need to look out for this stuff both for offensive and defensive considerations.   Speaking of enemies, the AI was actually fairly decent. They'll hide behind cover, often to the point of moving accordingly as you try to improve your line of sight. They'll back off if you put a nice dent in them, toss grenades at you, and rush you if they're in significant numbers. Many of them have their own shields, which is where the grenades do come in handy, as well as a precise sniper rifle.   Unfortunately for them, and for the general difficulty of the game, they move pretty slowly and are very prone to headshots from any weapon and at a surprising distance. Since your sniper scope has zero drift, all you need to do is crouch to turn yourself into a terror. Enemy snipers do relatively little damage and have poor accuracy, so you're generally in a superior position, even when faced with as many as three of them. They'll also attack from distances that make them little more than a minor annoyance, making it easy to pick them off before they're close enough to become a problem. Even the mechs you will encounter a few levels into the game can be taken down with a few mags of sniper rounds, as long as you're holed up inside a building (otherwise they'll tear you apart in short order).    As you can probably tell by now, BoS is a serviceable shooter hampered by a pile of small annoyances and lack of difficulty (save for the manageable spikes when you encounter a BoS competitor). The story is a bit disjointed and underpowered, and while this isn't a major consideration in the shooter genre, it looks like things are heading that way. Perhaps the weakest part of the game is the competition it's up against: Call of Duty 2, FEAR, Quake 4, Day of Defeat: Source, Star Wars Battlefront II, Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood, and several others I could rattle off.In the face of these titles, I can't honestly recommend Bet on Soldier. And the nail in the coffin is that everyone seems to be biding their time for these releases (or immersed in the ones that are already out), because there was hardly any BoS multiplayer to be found. In this context, BoS will probably be a temporary diversion. It's decidedly better than what Kylotonn has produced before, and it foreshadows some impressive work to come. But it provides little reason to shift one's attention away from the current avalanche of first-person shooting.", "date": "Oct 7, 2005"}
