{"name": "Golden Nugget", "name_review": "Golden Nugget", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/10/21/golden-nugget", "text": "Gambling games may not be the hottest titles on the market, but they are a whole lot of fun. And even if you suck at gambling, it's always fun betting huge amounts of money knowing that you can still make rent the next day.  Staged in one of Las Vegas' most glamorous casinos, Golden Nugget allows virtual gamblers to win it big, or lose it all, in 16 different games of chance. You can start off playing a little Pai Gow poker or test your wrists in a little game of craps. And if you're a big boss baller, you can even gain a V.I.P. pass and play on the 'high-stakes' slots.  Beside the semi-bland graphics, this game actually makes you feel like you're in a real casino - minus the obscure fog from cigars and cigarettes. Everything from crowd noises to raising the stakes, Golden Nugget puts you up against Vegas' best and the worst computer card sharks ever to hit Virtual Vegas. And with $10,000 bucks to blow, well hey, you're sure to have fun.  Another feature that sparked me personally was the added story mode. This mode allows gamers to gamble their way through the casino in an attempt to track down a stolen microchip. The story itself is a tad generic, but it does add a little spice to the already bland gambling scene.  All in all, this game is a whole lot of fun and highly addictive...only if you're winning of course. If you like gambling, but you hate loosing money, Golden Nugget is the way to go.", "date": "Oct 21, 1997"}
