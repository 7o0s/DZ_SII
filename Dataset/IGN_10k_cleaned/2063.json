While it didn't offer much in the way of beauty or style, it was one of the most intricate strategic simulations around. It evoked a cool tabletop feel and offered hardcore gamers a real alternative to the less faithful (but equally enjoyable) Panzer General series. But while Divided Ground is still a faithful simulation, the engine is really starting to show its age. Moreover the nature of the conflict in the Middle East is weighed down with a few limitations that keep the game from being as exciting as Eastern Front II or Rising Sun.  The Campaign Series is somewhat mixed. It straddles the line between operational games and tactical games. The player is put in command of a fixed group of real world units, represented by small icons. You can play the game in an isometric view where the units actually look like what they represent. Or you can play in a top down view where the units are represented by little squares. As a further concession to the boardgame inspiration of the game, it is played on a hex map in a turn-based format. Objectives vary throughout each mission but tend to center on the control of certain victory locations.  In 1948 the State of Israel was founded by breaking Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states. Within 24 hours, the armies of Israel's neighbors invaded. The Israeli Defense Force, the core symbol of Israeli identity and sovereignty, spent the next year fighting to defend the Israeli homeland in the Israeli War for Independence. With independence won but far from secure Israel fought numerous battles with her enemies over the next two decades. The Six Day War of 1967 and Yom Kippur War in 1973 underscored the deep divisions that still plague the area and frustrate the efforts of peacebrokers.  The game of course is much more topical and immediate than the previous games in the Campaign Series. While the Second World War might be more interesting and engaging from a tactical and historical standpoint, the conflict in Palestine is still unresolved (and will continue to be so for some time to come). That gives the game a sense of urgency that isn't found in most other games. The fact that this game has come out on the eve of a potential invasion of the West Bank is mere coincidence. Although, to be completely honest, you can pretty much count on there being some sort of conflict in that region eventually. That's sort of like releasing a Balkan Wars game and finding the region embroiled in real life conflict again.  Unfortunately the overall situation in Palestine, while interesting from a military and political standpoint, isn't necessarily interesting as a purely tactical military simulation. It begins very much as ~East Front in the Desert.~ Throughout the twenty-five years the game simulates we begin to see modern war take shape. The introduction of attack helicopters and improvements in anti-tank weapons add a few more tactical options but it's not nearly enough to justify a whole new game, especially considering the cool additions recently made to Rising Sun.  The twenty-two scenarios are well chosen but often reveal the indecision that is a feature of the Middle Eastern conflict. Too often one side has a much greater advantage over the other but it's often hard to translate that into decisive victory. That's even more of an issue in the game's few campaigns. You can recreate the tank battles of the Six Day War or fight it out with the Syrians and IDF in the Valley of Tears. How come we can't hold fights in the Valley of Ice Cream or something? It might change our perspective. Sadly there are no hypothetical scenarios. This is especially unfortunate given the highly fluid nature of the struggle.  Once you're done with the missions you may want to check out some of the other play options in the game. A full feature multiplayer version of the game is included but you'll have a heck of a time finding opponents on your own. The scenario editor is pretty wretched (which is especially frustrating given the game's potential for representing certain portions of the Vietnam War). I was also saddened to see that the random scenario generator that I used from Rising Sun was totally missing here.   The graphics and sound in the game aren't any better than in the last installment in the series. In fact, they're worse. While the lush jungles of the Pacific were interesting on their own, the flat deserts of Divided Ground grow more monotonous with every fight. There are plenty of features on the landscape that you'll need to stay aware of, but the overall sameness of the tile set starts to grate on your nerves after a while.  It's officially past time for Talonsoft to update the Campaign Series. A new engine would go a long way to re-igniting my interest in the titles. Hopefully a more interesting and varied campaign will be chosen as well. East Front II and West Front still hold a place of honor on my gaming shelf at home. Divided Ground isn't even going to leave the office. Maybe I can dig up an old copy of Arab Israeli War from Avalon Hill.  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
