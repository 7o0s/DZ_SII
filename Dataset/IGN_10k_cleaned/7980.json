But the France-base mobile maker opted to dig in and fashion an entirely new game engine to host these five conniving, lying, manipulative women. The inspirado for Gameloft's take on Desperate Housewives comes from the most unlikely place, too -- the original Mario Party on the Nintendo 64.   What?   The entire neighborhood, complete with turns inside the postcard perfect homes these women keep, is cast as a board game. Instead of chasing down stars, you roll the dice and advance spaces in pursuit of envelopes that contain clues that help unravel a mystery developing on Wisteria Lane. Penned by one of the show scribes, the ladies must figure out the history of the woman that just moved into Susan's home (which was foreclosed on by the bank after some pass interference by one of the women). Along the way, they must deal with each housewife's side story, such as Gabrielle hiding evidence from a tryst with her hunky gardener.   Every time you reach an envelope, you're asked a trivia question about the show. If you get it right, you score the clue and you get to roll the dice again. If you mess up, you're tossed back a few spaces and have to try rolling up to the clue again. When you do receive the envelope, it moves to another location on the board and the chase begins again. Complicating matters are other characters that join the pursuit, such as a reporter that hounds Bree while she tries to tell her neighbors to lie about her.   The boards are covered with other spaces, too. Some spaces grant you tokens that act like money of sorts. (You can go shopping if you cross green spaces.) There are holes in the board you must avoid or you'll lose a turn. Purple spaces give you cards that affect the course of the game, such as a card that steals an envelope from the other player or forces them to give you tokens lest they lose a turn. You can also find good cards, such as one that adds extra spaces to a roll or scores you an automatic 12 spaces. Minigame spaces drop you into skill contests, such as chasing a kid or laying some pipe (ha). From time to time, you'll hit secret spaces that ask you a quick trivia question about the character in the show. Answer these questions right and you'll get to roll the dice again.   When you do finally manage to pick up all of the envelopes required for the board, the game grades you based on how long it took you to meet the goal and how many tokens you picked up. Depending on your score, you advance rank with the ladies.   Gameloft divides the game into chapters, one for each housewife -- plus the newcomer in Susan's house. Each housewife's story is divided into missions, which are the actual board games. The missions are unlocked in a specific order, so you'll play one board with Lynette and the next board with Bree. The storylines start coming together, as they always do on the serial, after several missions. Between boards, you're treated to quips by the women. The story and the game mechanics are explained by Mary Alice Young, the deceased narrator played by Brenda Strong. (More games need to have Brenda Strong in them -- and that's not sarcasm.)   The board games can be played out in just a few minutes, so you're never glued into the game for very long if you're on a break. Smart pacing helps things, because I think longer boards wouldn't have worked. Show me what's up with Susan and then let's move on. While I admit that I do not watch the show -- which put me at a huge disadvantage with the trivia stuff -- I thought the writing was great. Fans will likely dig this side story and the fact that they don't have to play a hugely complex game to get at it.   As I just mentioned, Desperate Housewives is indeed not ~hugely complex.~ In fact, it's pretty simple in areas -- I lost games not because of rare foul luck but because I don't really know Bree from brie. This is a pretty casual game, but it makes sense for the casual fan base that Gameloft is undoubtedly trying to attract. Hardcore gamers weren't going to download a game called Desperate Housewives in the first place. But even so, I do wish there was a little more challenge to the game.   The game looks good, complete with lots of character portraits for every person in the game. Carlos, Lynette's kids, a skeevy reporter, all have mug shots right alongside the ladies of Wisteria. And these portraits are dead-on, too. I played the game on a w800i which has a great screen (but not necessarily a large one) and couldn't definitely recognize Felicity Huffman on sight.  Desperate Housewives was produced for a focused audience -- fans of the ABC show -- and I think they'll be amused by this game. The writing is smart, the characters are all present and accompanied by portraits, and the game doesn't put them through the wringer to learn the entire story. That said, if you aren't a fan, the trivia challenges will keep you at arm's length, preventing you from really getting into the game. The board game mechanics are promising, though, and I'm sure we'll see them pop up again with another license. Hopefully, though, next time there will be no gatekeeper and a little more challenge for the rest of us.", "date": "Jan 29, 2007"}
