Anything that takes place in Egypt and involves pyramids, hieroglyphics, and sand in your shorts is fascinating to me. Maybe that's why Luxor 2 is able still find a place in my gaming heart, despite being an almost exact clone of its predecessor.   Like most action-puzzle games, the premise is easy to grasp. It's executing it at the later levels that will have you swearing at your thumbs for not cooperating with your brain. Your goal is simple: Keep a chain of colored spheres gliding on a track from reaching the pyramid. But it's not just one chain alone. Once one appears at the beginning of the track, another comes along shortly after. Slide your winged scarab left and right on the bottom of your screen and attempt to match three or more colored spheres and break the chain. For example, if you shoot a red sphere and match it up with two other red spheres, they'll explode and either pause the chain or cause existing spheres to roll back. Chain reactions occur when three or more spheres collide attempting to get the chain moving again. The chains can be small or large depending on the level and unless you're quick enough you'll have to sometimes deal with up to four chains of spheres at once on the track. Chains stop appearing when you've filled up the progress meter at the bottom of your screen.    Controls are simple. Left and right do what they're told to do, and your OK or 5 button shoots a sphere. If you don't like the color of your sphere, press down and it will sometimes change colors. I've found that if you place your scarab under and closest to the color you want to pop next, pressing down will often result in the sphere changing to that color. If you can't get it to change colors, or you get a color and the chain doesn't have that color to match it, shoot it away from the chain and hope the next sphere you get is more to your liking. I advise doing this rather than just shooting it at the chain. Your goal is to keep the spheres from advancing so avoid adding unnecessary spheres to the chain if you can. (If I've over-explained the game it's because its frantic pace has given me colored sphere nightmares. Trust me, Levi doesn't pay by the word.)   Power-ups help you along your quest but most of them are just throwbacks from the first Luxor game. The Lightning power up is a one shot blast that eliminates any spheres you hit with it. Color Smoke changes all spheres to the same color. The Dagger power up lets you shoot and destroy spheres with daggers for a limited time. Fireball is a giant blast of sphere destruction. Other power ups include stopping the chains forward progress for 5 seconds, Speed Shot boost, Reverse, and a Net power up that will catch any coins or power ups you miss.    Speaking of coins, you have one more goal -- collect as many points as you can. Why is this necessary? Because you want to get your name on the high score board! Or am I too old school for that small bit of gaming happiness? Coins will appear after breaking chains and at the end of each level so catch as many as you can. Collect 20 Golden Ankh coins to earn a free life. Every fifth stage is a bonus level requiring you to shoot chains for points. Destroy all the chains as quickly as possible to earn more points. If your game ends, Luxor 2 lets you continue at the same level which put a smile on my face and kept me from throwing the phone like a quarterback going for the Hail Mary win in a football game. You may lose your points, but not your progress.   One thing I have yet to mention is the games difficulty. Some levels are fairly easy but as you progress further and further along in the game, the tracks become a twisting criss crossing maze that can present huge problems for you. Sometimes you're trying to shoot at one chain but you end up shooting at another that is crossing its path either above or below. You really have to pay attention to where the aim marker is pointing to or you could end up accidentally lengthening chains. After almost beating a level only to fail at the last second, I managed to chain together seventeen swear words.   Graphics are nice and colorful, and if you're wondering why many of tthe backgrounds are earthen, it's so they don't conflict with the colors of the spheres.Luxor 2 isnt breaking any new ground if youre a fan of the original, but then again it doesnt have to. Why fix what wasnt broken in the first place? Offering solid and challenging game play is more important to me than possibly muddling the experience, and the puzzle Pharaohs make sure that conquering this game will be no easy adventure.", "date": "Nov 19, 2007"}
