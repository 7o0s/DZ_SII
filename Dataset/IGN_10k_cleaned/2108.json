Many of these came in the variety of science fiction titles that dealt with conflict on other planets, or between other planets. Dune II, and Star Control are two that cone to mind immediately. Dune II, of course, is the one that really started me off on real time strategy games and the excitement and immediacy that came with fast paced and unpaused battles. Star Control really introduced me to the fun that could be had with interstellar travel and diplomacy and inevitable misunderstandings and conflict that follow. What I always wanted was a game that combined the space and the real time strategy. Then came Homeworld, which I consider one of the best games of all time. It was exactly what I had been looking for. Well it's been a couple of years now since that came out, and there really haven't been too many games emulating their total 3D style of play. Most space RTS games have adopted a 3D engine where ships are tied to a 2D plane, and therefore eliminating most of the real intrigue of fighting in space. However, the folks at Super X Studios and their Independent Games Festival Audience Choice winner of a game, Far Gate (formerly known as The Rift), brings us back into full 3D with some great ideas and fast paced gameplay even if it isn't quite perfect.   The story of Far Gate brings us to Proxima Centauri where a probe from Earth has discovered what appears to be the first inhabitable planet other than our own. After receiving information back from the probe, colonists were dispatched on an ass long journey across the galaxy to the planet in order to begin colonization procedures. However, things start going wrong as soon as the colonists arrive. Turns out, people can't live on the planet after all. After this minor problem is discovered, the colonists set up their first prefab unit (space station) near some asteroids that can be harvested for materials. In the meantime, your slightly insane fleet admiral takes off to find out about an anomaly near the planet. This is where things really start going wrong. Throughout the course of your journey, you'll run into two more alien species, much unlike yourself. They come in the form of the Nue-Guyen, a completely organic based species who's units are actual living entities, and the Entrodii, crystalline based life forms that see no use for organics. Both are pretty unique and have some very interesting opportunities for various strategies. Also, unfortunately for you, other forces inside your own group are starting to go nutty and cause problems as well (I'd tell you why, but I'd rather not ruin it). Needless to say, you've got a whole lot of fighting to do here against several different factions.  As I mentioned before, the game is presented in full 3D. In this case that means that you can actually move along all three axes just like you could in Homeworld. This means you'll have a lot more to worry about in battles. To start out most missions, you'll need to set up shop and start harvesting materials. Yes its true, this is a base building game. Human and alien bases all function along the same lines. You'll have the central hub where different sections can be attached such as resourcing pods, construction bays, and the like. On the end of each of these pieces, you can stick more pieces to create a rather large spinning wheel of a space station. On each of the arms, in between each of the pieces are two gun emplacements. Different weapons can be mounted here so that your base will at least have minimum protection if your fleet isn't around. You won't be able to depend on these defenses, but they certainly help a bit.  Anyway, you know the drill here, build a base, and then build up a fleet while defending said base and complete various tasks. While this is a pretty familiar chain of events if you've been playing RTSs for long, this time the maps are based around different solar systems that are connected via warp points. Before you start going down the Conquest: Frontier Wars stint, the systems are not connected to each other in the actual playing of one game. Games stay in one system to keep control from becoming unbearable which it just might have given the chance.  And controls are a little iffy at times along with some sketchy AI. The control system here is much like that in any other RTS. Except once again the Z-axis is introduced, which is handled a little differently than it was in Homeworld. If you'll remember, you had to hold the shift key down to move units along the third axis. While allowing for the distance to be set, it allowed for that distance to be set and changed even after you had set a depth or height along the Z-axis. Basically, it was easy to move around without too many problems. Far Gate takes a different approach. You'll move along the Z-axis by just holding the movement button down while moving the mouse. While that may seem pretty nifty at first, there were a couple of problems with it. First, for some reason, if you drag too far up or down, the movement marker would go away and be replaced by the drag and select box for selecting multiple units. You have no idea how frustrating it is not to be able to move units up and down very easily when it's supposed to make huge difference to the gameplay. Secondly, if you actually do manage to move the movement marker up and down without it turning into the selection box, you had better have gotten your distance right or you'll have to start over again and hope that it works twice in a row.  But when it comes down to it. It didn't seem that there was huge use of that final axis anyway. Whereas the Homeworld gameplay certainly made good use of it with units attacking from all sides in ways that could really confound opponents, it hardly ever really played a part here. Units almost always seemed to be coming across a 2D plane most of the time. Only once they were attacked did they start maneuvering along all lines. While this isn't always the case, there was much less reason to enjoy that extra dimension of fun here.  The interface of the game is actually pretty easy to use, even if all of the lines on the screen can be a bit cluttering at times. The actual GUI is pretty nice and can be turned off along with the lines, but there are some problems here as well that I couldn't figure out. First off, all of the interface bars are along each four of the screen borders. The left is for groups, the top is for the units inside each of those groups, the right is for commands for the units and structures, and the bottom is for objectives and communications. Each of them is tilted back for maximum viewing area except when passed over by the mouse when they come into view. You may lock them in place if you like, which I did even though some of the screen was taken away. As I said before, you can take the GUIs away leaving you with a screen with all of the depth lines and distance chart, but if you have a special command to give units, or if you want to build something, you'll have to have the GUI switched on. And when you have both the GUI and the depth and distance lines turned off, you'll be left with only a pretty view of the solar system. This would be nice, but you can't even see what unit you have selected or where they're going. I really wish they had adopted the movement style in Homeworld where by the click of a key, the distance lines are turned on and then off when the movement key is turned off. I found it efficient and uncluttered. Far Gate made it really hard to tell what was going on with the constant lines, bright colors, and many units.   And the structure to command unit was a little strange to me. When building units, you have to pick a group for them to be created into. This means that you can't just leave behind ungrouped units and create a few smaller groups when going into combat if you want more than a few units. And you'll need more than a few units... Don't get me wrong, it was nice for units to come out already added to groups at times, but not all the time. I don't want all of my units to belong to a squadron! Oh well. Annoying, but not game breaking.  The graphics were a little outlandish at times with pulsing fireballs for suns along with some funky planets and crazy units, but were still very attractive for the most part and had some fairly good personality. Colors were brilliantly diverse and vibrant along with some fairly decent special effects for explosions and weapons fire. Unfortunately this also gave itself to some very chaotic battles that were hard to control. Luckily that lovely pause and command feature that has made it into most 3D RTSs has been placed in the game.  Sound was a little sketchier. It just didn't convey the right kind of atmosphere. Am I supposed to feel like I'm in space because there's blooping and bleeping music with some violinish sounds underlying it all? Some of the music just made me think of some horrible 80's sci-fi flick. It didn't add to the suspense or really get me into the game at all. Sound effects were largely the same way. I realize that this is an independent title, but sound is becoming a much more important part of the gaming experience when it comes to suspending disbelief and creating the right atmosphere for the game.  Even though I did have some problems with the game, it still holds a bit of interest to me, and if I had more time, I'd most likely end up playing a bit more of this game to delve even deeper into the unique species offered up. If the interface had been a little cleaner to go along with some of its more helpful features (like the picture in picture feature when placing a cursor over units when zoomed out) and the sound had been thought through a bit more, this game could have been one that I really got into.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
