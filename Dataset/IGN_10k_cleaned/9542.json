It was one of the company's earliest, for one, having arrived on the NES in that system's second wave of new releases back in 1986. And it was one of the more abstract sports to be adapted during that time  other early entries in the NES Sports Series were more mainstream American pastimes like Baseball, Ice Hockey and Tennis. So Volleyball didn't have a lot going for it even in its original release over two decades ago. And now, expectedly, it's become the one 8-bit, first-party sports game to have aged the most over the years.   Even the poorly playing NES Soccer is more appealing a choice than this, as Volleyball is just immediately frustrating to try to control. You're put in simultaneous command of six different players, comprising your full team  three of them are up front at the net, and the other three are holding down the baseline at the back of the court. You perform a serve simply enough, with two successive taps of the A Button. But it's when the opposing team responds and the ball heads back toward your side of the court that things get dicey.   Because your men all move as one, together, in little groups directed by the same D-Pad input. And the little groups aren't easy to determine, either. If the ball has been volleyed back toward the far, bottom corner of your court area, for example, you'll probably end up controlling the two players closest to that region at the same time. If it's sailing a little shorter, and looks to land nearer to the net, you'll likely instead gain temporary control of your front three net guards.    The dynamically shifting jersey colors of Training mode are Volleyball's most interesting visual element.  And if you don't return the volley with a single hit of your own, then the wacky, near-random shifting of control will continue to different men on your team until such time as you do manage to get the ball back over to the other side, or else you miss a hit and the other team scores.   It's a mess. And such an unintuitive design that Nintendo actually included a Training mode to try to make sense of it all. There, your team is clad in stark white jerseys to begin. But as the ball heads your way, the jerseys of those players who have become active and controllable turn temporarily red. It's meant to teach you which sets of players will become available at which times, so that you can then play the ~real~ game  but Training might be the only way Volleyball's playable at all.   If, by luck or utter persistence, you manage to get a handle on the whole thing and actually still want to keep playing the game, you'll find a fair array of options included for a 1986 release. There are eight different countries' worth of teams to choose from (palette swaps of the same men, with identical stats all around), and you can also pick to field a team of women instead of men (again, making no difference at all to how the game plays).    There's a two-player mode as well, if you'd like to torture a friend along with you. But it's always two-player vs., not co-operative. Had it been co-operative, Volleyball might have offered a bit more playability  with one player handling just the front three guys and another player the back three, the design system employed here would have almost made sense.  But it didn't, so it doesn't.The NES eventually saw the release of a few more capable, more playable and more fun volleyball designs, like Kings of the Beach and Super Spike V'Ball. And Super Spike was actually published by the Big N here in the States, way back when, so it's possible that it will show up again here on the Virtual Console sometime in the not too distant future. So, if anything, wait for that. Because Volleyball isn't worth 500 Wii Points at all. It's a mess to control, and it feels aged much more than its other contemporaries in the early NES Sports Series. Even Soccer would be a better option....still better than Urban Champion, though.", "date": "Nov 16, 2007"}
