Out of all the games to choose from, out of the thousands of different titles available from the five different systems represented on the Virtual Console, we get this. China Warrior. One of the worst games to ever actually see a commercial retail release in the United States. This has to be some kind of joke, right?    Right?   There was a job listing recently on Nintendo's official Employment Opportunities page  NOA, up in Redmond, Washington, was looking for someone to fill the position of Virtual Console Manager. To be the one who decides what games go live on the VC and when. To be the quality control person.  We normally make VC screens smaller...  They should be fired. Seriously, Nintendo, we can only hope that the choice to run with China Warrior was made before this new manager position was filled, and that whoever's now stepping into the role will have more sense than this  because this game (if you can call it a game) does nothing more than strike another blow against the credibility of the Virtual Console as a reputable resource for retro games.   It stinks.    China Warrior casts you in the role of a nameless martial arts master, shamelessly based on Bruce Lee but having none of his charisma. You appear on-screen as a huge sprite, taking up almost a third of the display's real estate with your gigantic body alone  this was the selling point of China Warrior, you see, back in 1989. Its overly large characters were meant to gather the same oohs and aahs as the big boxers in Nintendo's Punch-Out!!, setting the game apart from similar titles that used only standard, smaller sprites.  ... but it would ruin the China Warrior experience.  You walk constantly to the right, even without pressing the D-Pad in that direction  it's automatic. You can stop the forward march by crouching or jumping up, which covers two of the total four actions you can take in the game. The others are punching and kicking  but you can't punch in the air, and you can't kick while crouched.   But of course you can't. It would just make too much sense to be able to actually attack the enemies running at you from the right side of the screen with more than a single standard strike. China Warrior sends waves of baddies toward your karate man, you kick them, and more come and get kicked after them. Occasionally there's a boss battle, won also by button-mashing the kick trigger and requiring about as much strategy as it takes to press the power button to turn this game off.  China Warrior's insultingly simple take on the side-scrolling brawler formula just serves to elevate the appeal of other TurboGrafx fighters  see, Vigilante really is passable compared to this trash. Its enormous sprite graphics were mildly impressive two decades ago, and its music actually isn't all that bad. But the gameplay is just far too restrictive, unoriginal and boring. Don't go anywhere near downloading this stinker, as absolutely any other game currently available on the Virtual Console service is more worth your money. Yes, even The Legend of Kage.", "date": "Jun 28, 2007"}
