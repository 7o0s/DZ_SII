It has elements of both an off-roader and a typical speed racer, but doesn't successful excel in either.Graphically, the game looks good, but not great. Tracks use a wider selection of textures which eliminates the repetitive look so prominent in other Nintendo 64 titles. At the same time everything seems to be running in a lower resolution, possibly because of this, and in turn the game looks outdated when compared to other titles like Top Gear Rally.The control is tight, enabling for a variety of powerslides and precision turns. In addition, each of the ten vehicles has its own unique attributes and performance heights. Some cars, for example, maybe super fast, but unable to handle rough roads. Others might be a bit slower, but able to race any terrain thrown their way with the greatest of ease.Probably the best part of MRC, though, is the fact that each vehicle can be modified to better meet the needs of a player. Tires, brakes, suspension, steering, gears and aerodynamics are all factors to consider for each race. This option is not only handy but a necessity. Certain tracks require better traction, for example. In such a case a player might need to change his tires from on-road to off.Imagineer only included a total of three tracks in the game for some reason. Each course can be raced mirrored and there's even a ghost-car, but really, it's just not enough. This is by far the biggest downside to the title.Don't expect a massive amount of jumps, crashes or car damage, either, as it simply isn't there. Though MRC incorporates off-road tracks and small bumps and bops in the game, cars rarely leave the road long enough to catch anything more than a mouthful of air. On the other hand, because of the cool power-slides, extreme turns and tight control it probably won't matter.An admirable selection of different game modes are present, from a standard Grand Prix Mode where players compete with computer controlled cars to time trials. And, of course there is a two player split-screen option for racing against friends. What racing game would be complete, after all, without one? Finally, Imagineer has even included the option of racing against the 'Devil' and 'God' cars, which are extremely fast and hard to beat. If players can best the cars in a match two secret cars will be awarded.Also, various weather conditions make the game harder. Snow, fog, and rain are only a few added obstacles to deal with throughout the courses.Imagineer has succeeded in creating a perfectly average racer. Unfortunately, Multi-Racing Championship just doesn't deliver the bang expected for the mighty buck. Serious racing fans may want to give it a rent, but we recommend that others wait for Top Gear Rally or San Francisco Rush.", "date": "Sep 12, 1997"}
