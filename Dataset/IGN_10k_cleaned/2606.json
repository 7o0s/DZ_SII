I've been a big fan of the Rainbow Six series of games ever since the original came out on the PC. And while there have been a few console versions of the game over the years, the PC versions have still been clear favorites for me. Partly this is because of the control system offered by the PC. But it's also because the previous console versions haven't tried to do anything but recreate the same experience on a different system.  Features 15 missions  Battery save (five slots)  Link cable support for four players  Only for Game Boy Advance  While the Game Boy Advance version of Ghost Recon suffers from a complicated control system, it successfully departs from the standard first-person model of previous ports. Rogue Spear on the GBA is a top-down tactical shooter much in the same style of Sega's Alien Syndrome or a Tom Clancy-fied Gauntlet. You lead an elite team of covert counter-terrorist operatives through numerous missions. You'll be called on to defuse bombs, gather intelligence and rescue hostages. Fore each mission you'll have to pick four operatives (sometimes less) from a pool of 24. Some are better suited for demolition work, others are better suited at reconnaissance. Most are just good for kicking ass.   The top-down perspective really works for this game and sets it apart as more than just a cheap attempt to cash in on the popularity of the GBA. There's obviously quite a lot of thought put into this version of the game and it's true to its roots while still seeming like its own game. It preserves the intensity and gritty realism of the series perfectly. You control one of the four characters (you can switch freely among them). As you move, your other teammates move with you watching your back. Clearing out rooms or moving from cover to cover outside, you'll rely on your teammates to pick out an eliminate any terrorists you happen to see. As in the PC game, you'll probably be doing most of the work, but your teammates are still useful.   The game automatically saves your progress from mission to mission but there's no save option within the missions. While this can get frustrating when you loose half your team clearing the final room of a level, it really adds to the intensity of the game. In the PC version the missions automatically end whenever you've eliminated all the terrorists. This time around, even after all the opposition is taken care of, you'll still have to schlep hostages around and take care of your other objectives before you can proceed. This can get a little tiresome after a while especially considering the size of some of the maps.   Luckily the maps are all designed well enough that you might not mind having to run back through a time or two to pick up any hostages you might have missed. The spaces are large and look very natural. Some are laid out along a more linear path than others but, for the most part, the team did a good job of giving you more than one approach for a given level.   The sprites for your team and the terrorists are pretty remarkable given their size. With just a handful of pixels and some simple animations, the team has managed to add a lot of personality and life to the game. The same can be said of the sound. Footsteps, gunshots and, yes, even the cries of hostages are all done really convincingly.   But as great as it is, Rogue Spear is not without other problems. Occasionally you'll discover that the range of the weapons is such that an enemy can shoot you from beyond the edge of the screen. What gets me is that the enemy would normally be in plain sight if the confines of the screen weren't so narrow. A handy arrow indicates the direction the fire is coming from but by the time you see that you might as well kiss one of your operatives goodbye. (Entering strafe mode lets you see a bit further but it still doesn't completely eliminate the problem.)  Here's a typical example of how this might work:  Off-screen terrorist: BANG! Me: What the...? Off-screen terrorist: BANG! Again Me: (slump)  While that's a bit of a pain, I think that the only other weakness of the title is the control scheme. The four buttons on the GBA are used for ten different commands. If you want your other operatives to hold position, you have to double tap L. If you want to crouch, you have to hold down L and then hit A. If you want to switch characters you have to hold down L and R and then hit B.   The fact that there are two different control schemes complicates matters further. One system is outlined in the manual, a slightly different, more complicated scheme is shown on the reference sheet at the back of manual. Since the alternate, secondary scheme only changes a few commands it seems kind of unnecessary. It doesn't tie the hostage rescue command to the same key you use to shoot though which saves you from accidentally shooting a hostage you're trying to save. (I'm not an idiot but it happened more than once.)   Around the IGN office, Rogue Spear (and the entire franchise) was definitely a big multiplayer draw. Many nights you'd find a dozen of us crowded into the PC area calling out tangos and cackling gleefully as we shot each other in the foot. Thankfully the GBA version retains the two best features of the PC game -- cooperative mission play and head-to-head competition. Unfortunately while the adversarial mode is playable by up to four players, only two players can participate in the actual missions themselves. Multiplayer requires that each player have their own game pak.There's a sizable portion of the GBA audience that's mature enough to appreciate this title. Ubi Soft's really counting on the 13 years and older gamer to drive sales. I recommend the game to anyone who's notcompletely put off by the complicated control scheme. That even includes people who played the PC version. This is such a different take on the game that it seems really fresh.Sure, there's a bit of frustration here and there and the controls are (necessarily) complicated. But overall, I keep coming back to Rogue Spear to play it again and again. It's not the ~Shut down your wholelife~ kind of game like Advance Wars or Golden Sun but it's easily one of the most intelligent GBA titles I've played yet.On a final note, the game comes with a small poster advertising Ghost Recon on the GBA. Since the levels in that game are much more open than those in Rogue Spear, it'll be interesting to see how Ubi Soft handlesthe translation. Hopefully they'll approach the project with the same originality and faithfulness apparent in Rogue Spear.", "date": "Apr 9, 2002"}
