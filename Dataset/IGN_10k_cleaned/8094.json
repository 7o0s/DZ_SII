Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/02/22/bonanza-bros-review", "text": "Mobo and Robo Bonanza sit lazily on their couch when a mysterious figure appears on their TV and wishes to solicit their services. The man owns many buildings and wishes to test their respective security systems. Given a list of several items -- and only three minutes to collect them all -- the Brothers are thrust into the predictably shallow and quirky story endemic of the era's games in the genre.    If the brothers are there to merely test the security systems, then why upon failure of a mission does it show one of them in shackles and blatantly in a jail cell? For some odd reason the game's story was changed to this premise from the far more plausible one that was prevalent in the original Japanese version: the brothers are thieves and looking for some booty (brothers that play together, stay together).            The game has been present on various collections over the years, as well as gracing systems such as the Atari ST and Commodore 64. So, from the arcade and now to the Genesis, how does it hold up?   The gameplay is relatively simple, as either one or two players sneak through multi-floored levels in search of electronics to ~borrow~, haul up to the roof, and hop on some sort of blimp before three minutes are up. The AI in the game is decent for the time, as enemies will either hear or suspect the presence of the brothers nearby. The brothers are equipped with guns firing rubber bullets that merely stun enemies. This adds a degree of difficulty as the immobilization of the security guards is only temporary. The player can either jump, shoot, or lean up against walls as they travel through locales such as a mansion, a mint, a casino or a bank.    When hit, the player drops any loot they've gathered up to that point and lose a life -- and this will happen a lot. Some guards have rubber bullet guns like the brothers, others have riot shields and a baton (and can only be hit when facing away from the brothers), a giant fat guard that throws grenades, and awkwardly animated dogs which pursue at an alarming rate.    There is a nice mix of enemy types that make each level challenging, as you may pump seven rubber bullets into Ruben Studdard only to find the guard you just incapacitated behind you has come to and wants Justin Guarini-esque revenge. It can be tricky busting into rooms only to find three guys with shields and you have nowhere to hide. The difficulty is challenging, but not frustratingly so.   The difficulty is toned down a bit as the radar above displays where all the items are hidden. Further, this occupies precious screen space, as the developers for some reason decided to make the screen permanently split, regardless if a buddy is joining you in the fun. This means that the entire time the top half will be flashing for a second player to join and is pretty annoying. The simple solution is to play the game with a buddy and tackle the objectives together. Bonanza Bros pretty clearly demonstrates its arcade roots. It plays and feels like a time-limited experience as the appeal can be quite short-lived.  It is a little more fun with a friend, but the limited number of levels and relatively simplistic gameplay make this game difficult to recommend unless you're a diehard fan.", "date": "Feb 22, 2007"}
