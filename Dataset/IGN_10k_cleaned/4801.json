Not necessarily in a car, but traveling in a car makes it easier. Codemasters has wrapped up another excellent racing game with IndyCar Series 2005, a game that attempts and consistently succeeds in re-creating the IndyCar series and that gives dedicated IndyCar fans not only a solid racer, but a real tribute the IndyCar scene. And it does a particularly great job of delivering that lovely sense of speed I so desire.   With heavy replay value and a great set of features, the big new addition to the series is its online play, enabling up to 12 people to vie at high speeds simultaneously. IndyCar Series 2005 is, however, a niche title, meaning that it's unquestionably for a narrow section of fans. Those folks interested in a casual arcade race, or who like getting a little drunk and playing Cruisin' USA in the arcades will not, I repeat, will not enjoy this game at all. It's a game of .03 second winners, a game of incremental lap increases, and a game of intense concentration and focus. Not a light racer for little Johnny and his Mario Kart buddies, this.    Gameplay  Codemasters' IndyCar Series 2005 is one of those games you don't just happen to casually pick up and drop in your Xbox and instantly love. It's not a quick pick-up-and-play game. It's a fan's game, aimed at those folks who absolutely love to watch the Indy Racing League and the hundreds of drivers who compete annually at these amazingly well-attended events. It's all about giving fans of oval racing their money's worth.    As such, IndyCar is packed with a fat list of features, races, some improvements over the first iteration, and new online play. For starters, there are a solid set of improvements. The game this year sports about four different view points, with two in car-angles, the cockpit view providing rear view mirrors. This was somehow left out of last year's effort, which is kind of dumb when you think about it. The addition of online play is spectacular, and the host of options is healthy. Players can vie via System Link if they chose, and if you like to plug in a steering wheel, the game supports third-party wheels. The other cool new feature is that players can actually re-create a full season as one of their favorite racers.     What I found very, very helpful is the Masterclass feature, i.e. the tutorial mode. It presents the skills required to play this deep, focused simulation in several batches, and gives players chances to work their way up by earning medals. (The medal system is back and still enjoyable, btw.) I raced around like a fool before hitting this mode, which explained the importance of tail angles, fuel mixtures, drafting, and even how to use the track's colored sections to your benefit. I never knew that the blackened sections of the track contain burnt off rubber that fills in the grooves of the track; this is important because those sections provide more grip than the lighter sections. And since IndyCar is so focused on improving one's timing by split seconds, every little thing counts.    The other modes are all solid. You've got Quickrace, the IndyCar Series, The Indianapolis 500, the biggest motorsports event in the world, and considering every race is 20-50 laps each, you're going to get your money's worth. For those without online connections, Codemasters was nice enough to provide you with split-screen and System Link capabilities. There is no lack of replay value here.     The online functions are solid, and the gameplay is remarkably smooth. The menu systems are easy to navigate, and the sense of speed is hardly impeded by being online. The online modes feature QuickMatch; Create a Session (which includes a host of features including the ability to hold a private session, number of players, AI cars, and forced ranking); and Optimatch (which offers the options to change the track, number of laps, inclusion of AI cars, skill level, handicap and ranking). There's also a friends list, a recent players list, and leaderboards.    IndyCar isn't going to rock the racing world with major new changes in racing games. The sense of speed is very good, especially in the cockroach and cockpit racing perspectives, while the third-person perspectives offer a weird floating sensibility. Essentially the car's shadow isn't created dynamically, thus providing a fake-looking shadow that makes the car look like it's floating.   The racing itself is tough going. I strongly recommend hitting the easy mode at first and working your way up from there. For a racing series that basically find drivers turning around constantly turning left, the strategies and competitive AI make for a consistently fun and engaging races. The main thing about this game is that you must continue to put in good laps -- consistency is key to winning. If you mess up a single lap, or watch an AIM message pop up on your computer screen like I did, you may lose three to five seconds, and lose the race. Catching up is not impossible, but it's tough.    Lastly, you will take damage, and deal out damage, and full-on pileups with 33 cars on the track simultaneously can indeed happen. It's a tough-to-swallow situation, especially if you're involved, but it's great to watch if you can sift through the rubble on your way to victory.    Graphics  For a Codemasters game, this is not the best representative of the company's finest graphics. Indycar Series 2005 is not blessed with a great particle system, nor a great lighting system. So while you'll see a great pileup, you won't see fantastic explosions or cool exhaust backfires, or a great lighting system creating perfect shadows and great hues in the sky.     The game, however, does a great job of presenting each new course with a healthy amount of perspectives showing its strengths and weaknesses, hot spots and tough sectors. You'll also notice exceptional car models and details, and it's always good fun to see your driver in the cockpit mode struggling to maintain control as he tears around a corner at 210 MPH. The courses are good looking, but the fans are entirely stiff. You'll never see one actually moving, just a few camera flashes here and there.   Sound  Following last year's effort, Codemasters has once again included Dolby 5.1 support, though it's automatically connected so you won't see the choice on a menu. That makes the sounds of vehicles moving at 220 MPH and coming up behind you very, very intense indeed.    The majority of sound is focused on just two basic kinds, your spotter, who tells you your racing relation to opponents, the sounds of cars around you, and the reliably rocking soundtrack. The musis is that's recognizable as ~adrenaline-pumping~ is generic race car music; it's neither Leonard Skynard nor Joe Satrioni, but it's good enough to make you feel satisfied after a win.The whole thing about Codemasters' IndyCars 500 2005 is you just got to be a fan. It's a niche title that's dedicated to people who love this particular kind of racing, meaning this game is not a whole lot unlike a NASCAR game in its aim -- to please the fans. In design, IndyCar is solid enough, sporting a hefty amount of modes, including a respectable online set of features, and it's fast, not the fastest game ever, but very fast. And the AI is competitive enough to create problems for the drunk, stupid, or less than focused. It's not a whole lot better than the first effort, but the small incremental additions do make it a better experience overall.", "date": "Jun 22, 2004"}
