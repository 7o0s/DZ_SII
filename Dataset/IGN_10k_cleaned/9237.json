That alone is a very valid reason to be jovial, but Valve has gone several better on all of us and made this an irresistible package. The company has generously packed in the original game, alongside Episode One and Two, as well as tossing in two other key games - Portal and the superb Team Fortress 2. Both are essential parts of why Orange Box is worth your time and money. We've compiled Australian reviews for 'the big three' new games in the package for your reading pleasure.    Half-Life 2: Episode Two Review  Patrick Kolan   Oh, so that's why it took so long to get released. While we were sitting in our ivory tower, griping because we still didn't have our copies of Valve's next Half-Life instalment, Valve was plugging away, making the best first person road trip simulator we've played in a long, long time. Simply put, Half-Life 2: Episode Two is epic in scope and you end up covering a lot of ground by the end of the episode.    If you haven't played through Episode One - and you're missing out if you haven't - the game kicks off immediately after Gordon and Alyx make their train-bound escape from City 17. You awake in the twisted steel hull of the crashed train carriage, dangling precariously above a river, and slowly shifting downwards as you make your escape. It's a very dramatic opening area that really sets the scene for the chaos that follows.    As the bridge collapses, it displays fantastic large-scale physics effects that eventually become a key part of what makes Episode Two so spectacular. Throughout the six hours of gameplay that Episode Two provides from start to climax, things are blown up, fall down, disintegrate and get fractured all over the place, all without the aid of a $500 physics card. The improvements over Episode One are tangible enough, let alone when compared to Half-Life 2.    We won't dive into the story too deeply so as not to spoil it, but suffice to say, you spend a good amount of the game with Alyx as your companion gunner, and probably half of the adventure is guided along dirt trails and paved highways in a beat-up, hard-revving muscle car. It's barely a frame, a chunky engine and two seats, but it definitely does the job.   Hunters and HDR lighting. That's Episode Two for you.   ~What's next in the parade of constant obstacles?~ muses a lone Vortigaunt. What next, indeed? Episode Two keeps a frenetic pace from the opening moments. There are fewer areas of straight-up exploration this time around. Most areas - small villages, train lines, weaving web-lined tunnels - are crawling with enemies. The episode crams as much action in there as it can without dissolving into constant fire fighting, and has a pressing sense of urgency. Like the previous instalments, Episode Two also knows when to pause long enough to let the player appreciate the spectacular architecture or take in the entertaining exchanges between resistance fighters or key characters.   Similarly, the pace at which you gain your weaponry is nearly perfect. Along the way, retrieving your crowbar is key to unjamming a couple of turning gears. Later, getting your hands on the rocket launcher either means solving a very clever rocket-jumping puzzle (unlocking the highly amusing 'Rocket Propelled Gordon' achievement) or waiting it out and effectively having it handed to you just in time for the climax of the game.   The new offensive weapon, given to you right at the end of the game, is a Strider-killer. Effectively a sticky bomb that can be collected from spawn stations, the 'Magnusson Device', is launched by the gravity gun onto the body of the Strider and then detonated with a round from a gun. Strider goes boom.    However, doing this is greatly hindered by the other major new enemy inclusion in Episode Two: Hunters. Like an eight foot tall Strider coated in pearlescent blue and white and packing rapid-fire explosive 'flechettes' (basically explosive pronged darts), Hunters are agile, able to weave quickly through tight spaces and absorb bullets like a rummy can down a bottle of cheap whiskey. They're not mind-blowingly amazing, but you will learn to fear them and pray for something explosive to hurl their way.   A lot of the initial screenshots for Episode Two were a little deceiving in terms of linearity. While some areas are quite large, the highways, rivers, grassy knolls, forests and sprawling industrial complexes are divided intelligently by length. When you're not speeding through them in your car, you're exploring certain parts on foot. Go too far and you'll find a conveniently placed drop into an abyss or run into a stone shelf. Heading along a highway eventually leads to a tunnel that acts as a loading point for the game, transitioning you from one segment to the other, but also spoiling any allusions of seamless, epic questing.   Although divided up and fairly linear throughout, every area is crammed with small details that inject personality. Buildings are intelligently modelled and every element of the design has a grounded-in-reality logic to it. Even just driving along a road can be a sightseeing experience; vistas reveal wondrous lighting conditions, throwing soft shadows across stone walls and over felled trees, slowly beginning to decompose.   It's not quite as varied and natural in practice as something like Oblivion, but there are definitely areas that Valve has nailed and will floor you when you first encounter them. The final encounter, involving squads of Hunters accompanying Striders in a wide wooded zone, looks brilliant. When buildings start disintegrating (and believe us, it's worth sacrificing the achievement the first time through just to watch it happen), your jaw will drop. Incremental updates to the game engine have turned this game into a physics munching super beast.   Outstanding in just about every respect, but not quite as open-ended as you may have been led to believe.  Of course, all the technological glitz would amount to absolutely zilch if the game didn't play so outstandingly well. It does. In fact, we'd go one step further and say that it was far more entertaining and impressive than Halo 3 was from start to finish. And to think that this series has managed to live up to expectations without needing to hype itself onto every available advertising surface! Uncanny. Yes, even episodic Half-Life is still utterly fine, fine gaming.    It's not quite perfect, however. There are too many health packs and ammo pick-ups on standard difficulty, and occasionally Alyx or your Vortigaunt companion can be a little bit retarded. They sometimes get in your way when firing and, although infrequent, will rush ahead and alert a bunch of enemies to your presence through stubborn proactive reactions. But for every dumb reaction, there's a tremendously cool, large-scale battle sequence, puzzle area or exploration segment around the bend that grabs your attention and reminds you of why sometimes the ends justify the means - and why Valve still sits at the top of our list of favourite and most unquestionably talented developers. Bless 'em.   And it's short - but what of it? That's neither here nor there. Criticising an episode for being short is a little unfair. That's the nature of the beast. However, weighing in at six hours of gaming does leave us wanting more. The game is obvious about building to a climactic encounter, and when it comes, you're not really surprised. But the key issue is that there's not a lot to draw from the ending - no trailers, no hidden message - just the knowledge that you've now beaten that middle episode and now you're going to have to wait for however long it takes Valve to wrap things up. By our calculations, you should be crossing the finish line with Gordon Freeman sometime late in the year 2027.   Episode Two leaves us feeling bittersweet about things - completely satisfied that the game was utterly compelling and exciting and other overused buzz words, but also feeling that empty sting that we felt when The Empire Strikes Back resolved the way it did. It's that pang of longing that makes us even hungrier for Episode Three. Please, Valve - take your time, but for the love of god, hurry it up.    Portal Review  Cam Shea   Moving through Portal's cold, clinical looking environments, it comes as something of a relief to discover that this is a game with a great sense of humour. From what we knew of Portal, it was always going to feature innovative gameplay and creative puzzle design, but its sly and decidedly strange sense of humour is the much-needed icing on this delicious cake ('ho ho', say the readers who've already finished it). To put it another way, any game with a tragic love story between a woman and her crate automatically gets two thumbs up from us.   The humour - and related story elements, are an important inclusion, and turn Portal from a tech demo into a game, denouement and all. To say too much would be to do a disservice to those of you who haven't played it yet, but this is a world that really grows on you - deliberately artificial at first, but one that becomes more and more interesting as you start to see behind the curtain, and as the narrator reveals more of herself.   But enough about that. Let's talk mechanics. Prey once promised to reinvent the first person shooter, but by and large its portals were little more than fancy-looking doors. Portal, on the other hand, is a completely different story, radically changing the way the player interacts with a 3D world, and doing so seemingly effortlessly.   The basic mechanics couldn't be simpler. With the left and right mouse buttons you can fire two separate portals, one blue, one orange. Go in the blue one and you'll come out the orange one, and vice versa. This means that not only can you avoid the stairs by simply firing a portal at your feet and one on a higher floor (saving all kinds of travel time!), but you'll also often see your character through portals, and can even create infinite loops. Fire a portal at your feet and one above your head and away you go. Weeeeee!   Portal is more than a one-trick pony. We'd love to see this technology in Half-Life Episode Three.  But portals are about more than just zany antics and lazy slobs, they're about puzzle solving, and with the ability to link two disparate points in space, you suddenly have a lot of tricks up your sleeve. At a basic level you can circumvent that pit full of acid or that fence by simply placing a portal on either side and stepping through. Or you can avoid being killed by a sentry gun in any number of ways - drop a box from another location onto it, fire a portal at its feet and make it fall through to another spot, or hell, just portal in behind it and knock it over.   One of the cleverest implementations of the concept, however, comes as a result of momentum. Momentum, you see, is maintained as you move through portals, so the faster you go in one, the faster you come out the other. A practical example? Imagine you have to get up onto a high ledge on one wall in a room with towering ceilings. By placing a portal high up on the wall opposite the ledge, and one on the ground underneath that wall, you can drop in through the portal on the ground, fall down from the portal on the wall (gaining speed as you go) and into the one on the ground again, which will result in you getting slung out of the portal on the wall at speed, across to land neatly on the ledge. It's a genius idea, and the further in you get the more you need to use every permutation of portal physics to get through the levels. Be warned though; it can be disorientating when you're jumping between portals on the floors, walls and ceilings, so some puzzles may take a few goes as you to try to work out your orientation to fire off a portal in mid-air, or land just so.   Mixed in with the portal shenanigans are a few other mechanics - pressure switches, crates and energy orbs that need to be directed to power up things in the environment, but the approach really is a very restrained one. You have your portal tool and the ability to pick things up, but that's it - no guns, no melee, none of the accoutrements you'd expect from a first person title. This is most definitely a good thing. While we can see the day when Valve may integrate the portal tech into a more traditional game, this is a great way to kick off such an innovative concept - movement puzzles and lots of 'em.    Needs more headcrabs!  This purity of focus also flows through to the visual design. As mentioned at the top of this section, the world is sparse and clinical, and we're glad Valve went in this direction as it means that there's no clutter to confuse what you can and can't do in any situation. You know at a glance which surfaces will take a portal and which won't (light grey tiles versus dark, metallic-looking tiles), you know which objects in the room you can interact with and what they're used for (boxes can be used to weight down switches and to shield you from any glowing orbs bouncing about, which, incidentally, always have a receptacle somewhere in the level), and you even have clear signposting for cause and effect. See those dotted orange and/or blue lines in some of the rooms? They basically link an action and an outcome - 'oh, so that pressure point is linked to that door, okay.' The basic idea is that you know that you have all the tools to beat each situation, it's just a matter of figuring out how to do it.   Does this dumb down the game? Absolutely not. This style of design simply reduces the frustrations and lets the designers get really devious with the level design which brings us to our next point. As fantastic as Portal is, and as great as it is having extra difficult versions of six of the levels to complete (as well as six 'challenge' levels - beat the chamber in the least steps/time/portals) once you finish the game, we can't help but think that after overcoming so many technical and design hurdles to create the technology and the clear-cut gameplay elements, that Valve could have included more levels and stepped up the insanity of the puzzle design to an even higher level.   It's no biggie - Portal really is designed as a fascinating side-dish to the rest of the Orange Box, but the reality is that of the 19 'chambers' in the game, it's not until the teens that they start to get a bit meatier. The first twelve are really only tutorials - and very short ones at that, and it's not until the eleventh that you actually have the full gun (up until that point you can only create one portal). Still, the last few levels are hugely satisfying, and really see all the elements come together. Solving each puzzle may not be hard, but it is immensely satisfying and demanding of lateral thought, with near constant 'aha' moments throughout. And the end credits? Brilliant.   Is Portal's length a problem? Perhaps if it was longer the puzzles would outstay their welcome. Then again, perhaps Valve simply wanted to leave us wanting more.     Team Fortress 2 Review  Bennett Ring   And now we move on to the final part of Orange Box's trilogy of new content. You could say we've saved the best for last, as Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is doubtless the deepest, finest part of this overstuffed bundle of gaming bliss. We rarely feel this way about a game, but the fact is that TF2 is almost flawless. It shows that even though the wait has been agonising, we've been rewarded for our patience with a game that only ten years of development could create.    It's not that TF2 reinvents the genre - on paper it's easy to dismiss this as yet another team-based shooter, based around the same old capture the flag/territory system that has been popular since the golden days of Quake Wars and the original Team Fortress. But it's in the playing that the painstaking care that has gone into every area of the game becomes blindingly apparent. There isn't a single feature or gameplay mechanic that hasn't been lavished with years of attention to detail. When a cool feature pops up for the first time, it's easy to imagine the team at Valve spending months discussing it over pizza and beer, crafting something as seemingly insignificant as a sniper's scope into an element of gaming perfection.    At first glimpse, TF2 appears to be a rather simple game. Don't let appearances deceive you though, as this couldn't be further from the truth. The game demands a level of teamwork that is second-to-none - a disorganised team versus one that works together is mere meat for the grinder. TF2 only appears to be so simple due to Valve's amazing ability to present the game's complexities in a way that even small children could understand. Not that small children should witness the bloody mess that results when a TF2 rocket smacks into the torso of a player.   You'll see this uncanny knack for user-friendly design the first time you join a map. A cute black and white introduction movie explains the objective system for each map, as well as a brief layout of where you need to go. Hell, even before you join a map, while using the speedy, configurable server browser, you'll feel like the game is welcoming you with open arms. This hospitable design extends to selecting one of the nine different classes, each of which is massively distinct from the rest. A mere handful of well-chosen words, combined with character designs reflective of the handling of each class, are somehow enough to convey what each is best for.   Instantly iconic character design compliments near-flawless gameplay.  The actual level design, where massive sign posts point out the key areas of the map, make the game seem simpler than it actually is. A flawless, crystal-clear VOIP system makes communicating with team-mates as natural as chatting with somebody sitting next to you. Smaller details, from the way the medic's health beam actually has little first aid crosses in it, to the way characters automatically thank medics for healing them, are yet more examples of how every aspect of the game has been crafted in a way that makes understanding it as easy as possible.   Which is a good thing, because actually winning in TF2 is not easy at all. With only twelve players on each side, spread out over sizable maps, communication and teamwork is an absolute must. The most vital aspect is to have a good spread of classes, and to use them together where possible. Heavy Gunners are next to useless without a Medic, while Soldiers and Scouts make a formidable offensive group in sufficient numbers. Engineers benefit from the protection of the defensive classes such as the Pyro or Demo-man, and Snipers and Spies are the only two classes who should ever consider going it alone. On the first day of release, as players experimented with each of the classes and learnt their way around the maps, it often felt like most TF2 players were actually mute, so little was the VOIP utilised. But in the few weeks since the Beta went live, these players have rediscovered their ability to talk - on better teams the comms channel is continually filled with the chatter of a team strategising its way to victory.   Due to the large number of classes, and the vast difference between them all, there's a play style here for everyone. It also ensures plenty of variety if you get tired of one class - switching between the lumbering brute that is the Heavy Gunner and the nimble, ninja-like Scout is like playing two entirely different games.    We think we've made it clear that the presentation and gameplay mechanics are impeccable, but even they're overshadowed by how damn gorgeous this game is. The art direction is best described as a Warner Bros cartoon with guns, resulting in one of the most unique, charismatic games we've seen in years. It totally shuns any form of realism, yet the whole look is so consistent that it's totally believable, if that makes any sense.       Recognising different player classes from afar has never been easier due to the fact they all look so different, and this extends into their animations. The Heavy Gunner waddles around as if his gun really does weigh as much as a small car, while the speedy Scout's legs paddle faster than Road Runner's. The game's personality is reinforced further by the side-splitting taunts. Every class has dozens, if not hundreds, of unique taunts - some of which occur automatically in the midst of battle.    Perhaps it's because the game looks so cartoonish that the over-the-top blood splatter isn't as offensive as it would be in a more realistic game. Regardless, the abundant gibs and spray lead to heavily contested areas that have more than a passing resemblance to an abattoir.   By now you're probably wondering why we opened up the review by saying the game was almost flawless, and not the enlightening beacon of perfect game design that we've so far described. Well, there is one slight issue with the game, but due to Steam's seamless ability to deliver new content, we're sure it's not going to last for long.   There simply aren't enough maps, with a meagre total of six. There's plenty of gameplay variety amongst them, with each having a different mode of play attached to them, but another four or five would have been perfect. And a little more diversity in their looks wouldn't go astray either - we'd love to see the art style of the game stretching to include lava-filled mountains, icy plateaus or foliage-filled jungles.   We can't see this being an issue for long. In fact, it wouldn't surprise us if Valve already has another half dozen tucked up their sleeves, but only released the initial six so that beginners could get to grips with the game without having to learn an overwhelming number of new maps.    Valve has once again used its Midas touch to bring greatness to a genre that is bogged down in generic clones and lack-lustre wannabes. If TF2 was only available as a standalone product, we'd have absolutely no hesitation in recommending it. The fact that it's available for such a great price alongside so many other great games absolutely boggles the mind.   Damn you Valve. That's what rival game publishers must be thinking. Not content with releasing a brilliant expansion pack in Episode 2, Valve has thrown in the phenomenal Team Fortress 2, as well as the mind-bending Portal, into a package that sells for the price of a regular game. Oh yeah, you also get Half Life 2 and Episode 1. It's a ridiculously over-stuffed box of high quality gaming, which simply can't, and won't, be matched for years to come. Oh how we pity the poor rival publishers. We'd have quite happily paid double for all of these games (provided TF2 had a few more maps) but no, Valve has given us all an early Christmas present in Orange Box. Shrewd marketing or insane accounting? Who cares when the gaming is this good? Game of the year then? More like Games of the Year.", "date": "Oct 14, 2007"}
