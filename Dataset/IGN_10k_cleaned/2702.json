Bugdom is one of those rare games. Pangea Software has managed to capture the shear pleasure of a 3D platform game and deliver it to Mac gamers. If you're familiar with titles like Mario 64 or Croc, then you have some idea of the kind of game that Bugdom is.   Bugdom puts you in control of Rollie McFly, the last of the Rollie Pollies. The Bugdom has been taken over by an evil fire ant king. Rollie must free the Lady Bugs who used to rule the land, depose the evil King Thorax, and return peace to Bugdom.   If the description sounds reminiscent of Bug's Life or Antz, that's probably because the game is clearly influenced by the animated features and even delivers a sort of Bug's Life experience.   Game play will be familiar to anyone who has played Nintendo's Mario 64. Rollie navigates a fully 3D world, exploring and solving puzzles. While the game itself may not live up to the quality of Mario, it is as close as any computer game has come to that kind of console experience. There are 10 very different levels to explore and Bugdom's environments are expansive, featuring a variety of stages to go through. Rollie also has a number of movements and attacks that help him navigate the landscape and thwart the ants, he can run, roll, kick and jump, as well as fire a buddy bug that acts like a mini-missile.   Console games are designed to work with a controller, but Pangea couldn't count on Mac gamers having a joypad, so they instead worked out an intuitive mouse and keyboard control method that works nearly as well, and is actually similar to the mouse control used in Doom. Rollie can turn left or right, move forward or backward, simply by moving the mouse in the appropriate direction. For players more comfortable with keyboard control, Rollie can also be propelled and maneuvered that way, or the keyboard and mouse can be combined. Overall, control is one area where Bugdom excels.   Many 3rd person perspective games, including blockbusters like Tomb Raider, have problems with their camera control, but Bugdom has managed to avoid this pitfall. In most cases, the camera floats right behind Rollie and gives you a clear perspective on the playing area. If you're unhappy with what the camera is showing you, you can rotate or zoom the camera in or out.   Graphically, Bugdom justifies the existence of ATI's Rage Pro chip set. All pre-Blue & White G3 systems come with either an ATI Rage Pro or Rage II video chip set. Ostensibly, these are 3D accelerators, but anyone who has tried to play Unreal using a Rage II can tell you that there isn't much horsepower there. Despite this, Bugdom look fantastic on an iMac. Even with only 2 MBs of VRAM, the game is a 3D powerhouse. Bump that up to 6MBs on a Rage Pro, and the visual quality is stunning. The only down side to Bugdom's excellent optimization for ATI chips is that if you have a system with a 3dfx card, it isn't going to do you any good.   One aspect of the game that is going to turn off some gamers and appeal to parents is Bugdom's non-violent nature. Even though Rollie is fighting the ants, he never actually kills any of them, he just sort of stuns them for a while. Quake fans may not like it, but it is a nice change of pace.   Overall, Bugdom is one of the best crafted platform games available for the Mac. The only thing holding this baby back is that the levels themselves don't offer enough variety. There is a lot of the same activity being performed over and over again. Still, the game is a fun play and younger gamers will definitely have a good time with it.", "date": "Jun 7, 2002"}
