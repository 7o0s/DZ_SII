For most, the first mention of the game was in trailer form when the PSP PlayStation Store for PC went live a week or two ago. The game quickly hit the European Store, but SCEA was mum about when the game would arrive for North America. Surprise: it's here and it's... well, it's a $5 application that turns your MP3s into a very basic rhythm action game.    The ~game~ part of things is fairly simple: symbols that correspond to the face buttons glide in on time (well, relatively, but more on that in a second) toward one of three landing points. Simply tapping in time with the correct button will help build up a combo meter on the right side of the screen, and by hitting special glowing symbols, you can build up an Overdrive Meter that lets you double your combo meter's multiplier for a short time.    The catch is that while in Overdrive, the symbols will slide in from the diagonals instead of arriving straight on from the left, right and top of the screen. Because you have to hold left or right on the d-pad to capture the symbols hitting those landing points, it can cause some fairly hectic button mashing segments, so there's a very basic risk/reward setup to going into Overdrive. Otherwise, it's simply a matter of juggling symbols as they come in, which is an easy to understand concept that requires no real tutorial (though there is one for those that are stumped).   What does require a tutorial is the other half of Beats' offering: a light music creation tool that uses the dozen tracks from SCEE titles like Team Buddies, EyeToy Kinetic and Drop Ship (plus a few tracks made just for Beats) to break apart the components into a custom mix. It's slightly similar to the remixing tool that was found in FreQuency, and if you spend the time becoming familiar with the various parts of a song (they're broken down into banks for synth, drums, percussion, vocals and so on), you can actually accomplish some rather interesting remixes.    Studio London did a damn fine job condensing what could have been an overwhelming process into something that can be figured out with just a bit of step-by-step instruction. The L Button lets you toggle a storage bank for multiple samples that can then be activated instantly with another L tap, and the R Button lets you cycle through the available samples of a song. Since you can play multiple samples at the same time, and because you have to flick through the ~pages~ of different instrument groups, learning to queue stuff up can lead to the best proper builds.     Once you've gotten the basics down, you can hit select to start recording a clip, then save it and even use that custom mix as a Challenge level like the regular game. You can also share the mixes with anyone else that jumps online, though the implementation of this is rather half-assed. Once you're online and sharing the file, there's no indication of when someone (or who) has downloaded it, so organizing shares with someone must be done outside of the game.   The online-enabled custom mixing game is equally lackluster because even though it's collaborative (with each person getting their own sample bank to screw around with), actually communicating with them is impossible -- or at least isn't explained in the game. Laughably, there's a ~game manual~ that you can pull up from the XMB, but it simply tells you to get help in-game, and the only help available is the limited tutorial. Yes, it's a $5 game, but it would have been nice to have a little extra help.      The actual game portion of the app lives and dies by its beat detection, and for the most part Beats lives up to its name, generating everything from coma-inducing patterns to absolute mayhem, though the actual complexity is understandably up to the music you feed it. Given the fact that all of the pre-supplied tracks are definitely of the electronic persuasion, it should come as no surprise that something with a simple 4/4 beat and minimal outside fuss would produce the best patterns, but Beats' digestion of more syncopated breaks and irregular rhythms still worked surprisingly well. More often than not, though, it wasn't dead on, leading to a slight disconnect from what you're listening to, though when it works, it elevates listening your MP3s to a new level, which we imagine was the idea.    Beats offers a certain amount of customization of the overall interface, too. You can choose from a whopping 70 visualizations to play and react in the background to your music. Usually this means a basic warping background pattern and something spilling out of the capture points when you hit a symbol, but the backgrounds change when you go into Overdrive Mode as well. It doesn't seem like the backgrounds themselves actually change to go along with the music, but still, the variety is nice. Likewise, you can pick one of nine themes for the main menu in either static (still wallpaper) or dynamic (music and a movie) flavors.     Reproduction of the MP3s is pretty solid, but there are some technical hitches to be dealt with. Slowdown is a minor annoyance, but it does happen fairly often, as do slight pauses while the game either analyzes the track to create beats or just buffers it or possibly both. Neither is quite as hard on the new PSP, likely due to the ability to buffer things a little more, but given the number of people out there with the older model, it's something we did want to mention.Were Beats a full-priced game, we probably would have been a little more upset, but what's here is the perfect definition of what a $5 download can offer. No, it's not nearly as perfect as it could have been, but oh well.Other parts of Beats come off as a little ham-fisted -- or at the very least like Studio London didn't quite give the game enough time to bake out some of the issues. Little things like not being able to restart a song after you get to the results screen, or just the loading times in general for something that's entirely Memory Stick-based, make it all feel a little less polished than it could have been. Even still, for just a mere Abe Lincoln, a mostly solid MP3 analysis and rhythm action game is a pretty decent deal, and I know the music geek in me will be playing around with different genres just to see what kind of patterns turn up. Vib Ribbon it ain't, but it isn't half bad either.", "date": "Dec 11, 2007"}
