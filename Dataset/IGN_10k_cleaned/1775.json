This game, much like this review, seems to be a bit late in the making because it's been nearly seven years since the movie was first released and just about three or so years since it's direct-to-video sequel hit retail store shelves around the country.   Regardless, The Lion King is probably still a strong license for young children and that's probably why Activision got the license and had Paradox Entertainment develop this game. Disney's The Lion King: Simba's Mighty Adventure is definitely a game targeted for younger kids that are very new to gaming as a mind-numbingly addictive and detrimental hobby that will eventually rot their minds to the point of no return.   Gameplay Even for a kid's game, this is a very small and simple quest. There are a total of nine levels that are comprised of a mixture of side scrolling, forward scrolling and in-your-face scrolling elements. While that can be perfectly okay, the levels all feel exactly the same and they pretty much are.   There are plenty of things to collect that open up hidden goodies, such as bonuses at the end of the level, mini-games, movies and puzzles, but even the least skillful of players will be able to unlock just about everything there is to unlock without even thinking about it. The game can be beaten in less than an hour and the mini-games will likely only keep one entertained for another hour at tops.   The game's biggest problem is that the control is very sluggish and unresponsive, which is a sin considering it's a kid-targeted title. Simba pretty much goes from walking to running recklessly without much warning and getting him to turn or stop isn't as smooth as it should be. It's okay for the most part because the level design is so simple that the bad control doesn't matter, but there are a few tricky platform-jumping segments that'll probably frustrate the hell out of some younger kids playing the game. And another frustrated kid is the last thing that this world needs right now.   Graphics Going into a tirade about how the movies were animated in 2D and this game would have been much better represented if it were done like Aladdin on the Sega Genesis is probably not worth the time. The company chose to make the game in 3D and that's what it is.   As a 3D action/platform game, it's pretty unimpressive. The texturing on Simba and the enemies is completely bland and unremarkable to say the least. It's almost as if they're just flat shaded polygons, but they're not. The levels are also comprised of mostly drab colors that won't impress even the youngest of kiddies.   The only real standout thing in this area is that the cinematic cut scenes are extremely well done and are the game's only real saving grace. There are compression artifacts, but nothing worse than what you should be used to on this console.   Sound All of the voices and music is straight from the animated films, so fans of The Lion King won't have to worry about some budge voice acting or lame music. Although, for those of you that thought the music in the movies were lame and hated Simba's ~adult~ voice, then you should step away from your PlayStation right now.   It's basic fare as far as sound effects are concerned. Lots of squawks, beeps, and other jungle-type noises, plus Simba can roar, which is tremendously cute when he's young. There are also a bevy of other ambient sound effects that help make you think you're in the movie.  I'd like to go on and on about how when I was a kid I was playing games that were about 100 times more complex than most of today's kid-targeted titles and didn't have any problems with them, but I won't. I'll cut things short by saying that even if you're in the market for an overly simple, cookie-cutter, kid-targeted game, there are better ones available on the system. 102 Dalmatians, for one, offers pretty much the same thing this game does but with better graphics, superior level design and much better mini-games. The only reason to pick this up is if your kid really wants a Lion King game, because if he or she does, the chances are that the cinemas and the fact that it's a Lion King game will be enough.", "date": "Feb 8, 2001"}
