Though he had the best intentions at the time -- namely saving your life -- the fact that he's swallowed the Dark Lum Chief is about to make your day much more dangerous and exhausting. In return for saving your life (and because you can't stand to hear him complain), you've taken it on yourself to find a doctor to rid your friend of his unwanted gastronomic tenant. The rest of the Lums are equally interested in seeing the Dark Chief escape for their own reasons.  The most significant change to the series is the slightly more mature tone offered in this latest version. In bringing a more mature approach to the series, Ubi Soft moves it in a slightly darker and more cynical direction. Rayman's environments and enemies (and in fact, the overall content of the game) are much more serious this time around while paradoxically still retaining much of the charm and humor of the series.  It seems like I've been doing more fighting than platforming in this iteration of Rayman but that suits me fine. While I miss the more direct platform action of the previous game, the extra emphasis on fighting helps to break up the monotony of endless jump puzzles. Rayman can now make use of a new curved shot that arcs around to the left or right, bypassing obstacles that may be in your way. To use this curved shot feature, you'll need to lock on to your enemies. This is actually a good idea anyway, to ease the few camera problems that combat presents. But more than that, it allows you to curve shots around obstacles. More than a novelty, this is actually a necessity for some of the game's fights and puzzles.  A few gamers have decried the lack of permanent power ups in the game. In the last Rayman, you could gain special abilities that stuck with you throughout the rest of the game. This time, you'll have to pick up temporary power ups to bypass the puzzles in front of you. These power ups appear as small cans once you trigger their arrival. And although the effects wear off quickly, the cans persist allowing you to come back and replenish your abilities in the face of a tricky puzzle. Some power ups allow for more powerful shots while others, like the helmet helicopter or grappling hook, grant you access to new areas of the level. Each new power up also comes with a new super hero skin for Rayman that lasts as long as the power up.   As far as the puzzles go, things are usually pretty apparent. I've hit a few puzzles that took me a minute or two to break but, for the most part, the puzzles in Rayman rely on a little common sense and some quick reflexes. The boss battles are also fairly intuitive and are structured so that you'll soon stumble on to the first piece of the solution even if you're just messing around. They're not overly reliant on gimmicks either which is a big plus.  I don't mind that the overall progression between the levels is more linear this time around, but I'm a little irritated by the inability to jump around a bit on the larger map. In a game like this you're encouraged to venture back to previous levels to hunt out every last reward the game has to offer. Getting from one level to another is actually a bit more difficult this time around.  But there's still a compelling incentive to go back and scour earlier levels for extra lums and gems. Gathering up all these special items gives you access to a range of bonus features, from interesting (but ultimately incidental) mini-games to short little trailers that show off the humor that's such a strong part of the series. You'll also receive bonus points based on how well you fight. You can build up Rayman's combo meter to gain extra bonuses at the end of each level.  I remember being wowed by the graphics in Rayman 2 and this new game delivers the same response (adjusted for inflation, of course). The texture work is simply breathtaking, with a whole range of effects. Shiny floors reflect the characters and objects above them while wooden walls seem rich and solid. Particle effects are equally well done with small puffs of pollen exploding out whenever you land on the large pink flowers at the beginning of the game.  After playing the console versions, the PC game looks the best by far. Running in 1024x768 resolution at 32-bits results is surprisingly smooth and fluid. There are a few snags here and there with the camera but everything else about the visual side of this game is solidly presented. It helps that the concept of the game supports the technical side of the presentation and actually makes it worth appreciating on an intuitive, emotional level.  Although all the game's animations are great, my favorite animations are the ones for Globox's drinking. Since he's carrying the Dark Lum Lord in his belly, he's developed quite an appetite for plum juice. Once he drinks it he goes through a series of squashes and stretches in fine Warner Bros. fashion. It's a blast to watch him hiccoughing and scooting around on the floor. Although the animation does take a while and grows slightly repetitive after a few levels, I still found myself cracking up.  The levels themselves are full of character and atmosphere. Better still, there's a wide range of environments here, from dismal swamps to crystalline towers. Loads of details and lots of objects help to flesh out the world in a fairly realistic manner that still manages to preserve the cartoonish spirit that infuses every inch of the game.      The Fruitopia-inspired in-between levels are simply gorgeous. Funky, disco-themed light shows provide enough flash and color for a dozen LSD flashbacks, while spinning flowers and floating text add a certain hippiness to it all. This portion of the game offers a somewhat different type of action as Rayman hops from rail to rail picking up gems. If you fall off (and you will, repeatedly), the game graciously replaces you fairly close to the point you fell off. The music even changes subtly as you pass each checkpoint, letting you know that you've moved a little further along the rails.  Each level has a distinct and thoroughly appropriate score. Ranging from the gloomily moody swamp music to the pulsing techno beats of the Teensie dance club that is The Heart of the World, the music definitely helps to set the tone for each of the levels as well as helps them stand out from one another. I'm not terribly crazy about the new theme song, ~Madder,~ as it seems to hit the wrong tone for the rest of the game.  At the risk of being crushed under the weight of scads of hate mail, I'll admit it to hating something else: I really don't like the new voices. I suppose it's more accurate to say that I do like the new voices, but I prefer the indistinct dialogue of the previous game. I'm definitely in the minority with this opinion (at least compared to the other editors) but there was something ineffably zany and abstract about the gibberish spouted by the characters in Rayman 2. In much the same way as The Sims, this unintelligible speech let me participate a bit more in the story, filling in my own meanings for the inescapable ~ooh pah pah dahs~ and ~eeshay wantu eetahs~ that filled the previous game. Now that you can (mostly) understand what's being said, this part of the game seems a little too direct. Like I say, I'm sure I'm in the minority here, but what the heck -- it's my review, right?  Having said that, I do think the voices are well done. Although Billy West and John Leguizamo are the two most well known of the game's voice actors, each role is handled quite well. The range of voices is greater than you'd expect on reading the cast list and the team has taken pains to give each character a definite and recognizable personality.  As a consolation for losing the sing-song babble of the previous game, Rayman 3 delivers some truly hilarious one-liners. Murfy praises Rayman in one scene, saying ~Good job, Rayman! Where would you be without you?~ He also wonders aloud at one point why the game manual is so poorly written. This savvy, self-referential style lets the game comment on itself at times. Breaking down this barrier and having the characters comment on the game as a game opens up many hilarious possibilities.  Just like Rocky and Bullwinkle, this game straddles the fine line between kid and adult humor. The conscientiously vague sexual references and self-deprecating asides aren't likely to be as funny (or apparent) to kids. But while the Teensies are cutting out of the action with hilarious (and fleeting) asides, the younger players will simply be content to giggle at the funny character models and wacky voices. Similarly, enemies like Razoff, the big game hunter will have kids and adults cracking up together.Platformers are few and far between on the PC, good ones even more so. Rayman 3 is a fantastic addition to the catalog and one that's sure to please most fans of the series. The slight emphasis on action and the tighter design may tend to dissuade a few die-hards from trying this one out, but they're only going to be hurting themselves if they discount the title because it doesn't follow the same pattern as Rayman 2.The deviations here are small but significant and nudge the series in a slightly new direction. Overall, it works. I still have a small bitterness in my soul for the new ~understandable~ voices but the rest of the changes are a good fit for the series. At turns dark, sarcastic and ethereal, Rayman 3 seems a bit more mature now than in previous versions. But these changes are incorporated so well that there's still a tremendous continuity with the rest of the series.I've never been one to compulsively seek out every reward or experience in a game of this type. While other editors are busily slaving away looking for the errant rail grind or hidden package, I'm usually moving on to something new. Luckily Rayman rewards thorough exploration without necessarily requiring it. As such, I've had a good few days with the title but I'll have to wait until nostalgia (and the dearth of good PC platformers) calls me back for more.", "date": "Apr 10, 2003"}
