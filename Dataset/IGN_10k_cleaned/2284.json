Every time a Scooby Doo title comes out, I hope it will be loads of fun and capture the essence of the Mystery Gang.  So far, they've all been disappointments.  Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase is based on an already-released, straight-to-video release of the same title.  After playing the game, I have little hope that the video is any good as well. Features Six levels Play as all five members of the Mystery Gang Password system to save your progress Only for Game Boy Advance   The premise of any good Scooby cartoon is that something spooky is out scaring people.  The Mystery Gang comes along and through hilarious antics manages to catch the ghoul only to discover it's not a monster at all but the museum curator or that cranky old man who owns the ski lodge.  Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase says to hell with convention and tries to pass off a Scooby adventure sans masked evildoer.  Someone has unleashed the Phantom Virus, so it's up to the Mystery Gang to beam into cyberspace and stop it before it does evil things like e-mail people porn or subscribes them to Christian Coalition mailing lists.  The game features six levels that can likely be beaten in your sleep.  In each level you'll collect Scooby Snacks while searching for very elusive clues.  To pass each level you'll need to find the box of Scooby Snacks.  The ~clues~ you search for are obscure objects that are supposed to help you deduce who released the Phantom Virus.  Finding these clues isn't necessary to passing the level, and they likely won't help you solve the crime, because it's hard to even tell what the clues are.  One is definitely a keyboard and I think one might be a shoehorn?  I dunno.   Before journeying to a level, you'll be able to choose which Mystery Gang member you want to be: Velma, Fred, Daphne, Shaggy, and Scooby are all here.  Sorry, no Scrappy Doo.  The gameplay is Zzzz city.  If you can stay awake through it all, you get to walk around collecting Scooby Snacks and jumping on platforms.  To avoid the nasties wandering the levels in very controlled patterns, you can either put on a mask (of which you have a limited amount) or throw a Frisbee at the baddie, thus stunning him.  You have unlimited Frisbees, which makes using the masks pointless.  There's no point in the game where putting on a moosehead is better than whacking a zombie with a frisbee.  I love me some platformers, but the first thing a platformer must be is fun.  And Scooby Doo is no fun. Scooby Doo has some nice animations and though most of the levels are very short, they do look pretty on the GBA.  The levels are varied, from a jet ski chase on the ocean to the climactic battle in a haunted arcade.  Some old Scooby foes make appearances, most notably the Creeper (my personal fave).  The Mystery Gang and their arch rivals look like they were plucked straight out of a Scooby Cartoon.  The dialogue is authentic, but sparse.  Velma says ~Jinkies~ and Scooby says ~Ruh Roh~.  The music is a real plus.  Each level has its own theme and most are a variation on the classic Scooby tune.  The Arcade level actually had music I wanted to hear more of.  Very cool.  On the other hand, the sound effects are pretty lame, lacking any of the flair from the cartoons.  What really kills the game (aside from the anemic gameplay and the fact that it's shorter than most naps I take) is the ending.  Once you've passed all six levels (in truth, you can skip the fifth level and go right to the last battle... how lame is that?) you'll be shown info on four suspects.  From your clues, you will have to choose one of the suspects.  If you choose wrong, you lose and will have to redo the final level to guess again.  If you guess right, you will be congratulated and then the game ends.  No masks are removed and Velma doesn't spout off some long-winded explanation of how the culprit pulled off his evil machinations.    Did I mention that there's no battery save?  Yeah, you get a password after you pass each level.  A password is cool for a game like Doom so you can go to any level you've previously passed, but here it's a bit cheap.  A game that needs to remember the number of Scooby Snacks you've nabbed, the levels you've completed, and the clues you've collected should have a battery save. In the 80s, saying Scooby Doo was bad would mean it was good.  See, back then people lived in a Bizarro world where bad meant good.  In the new millennium, bad means bad, and Scooby Doo is bad indeed.  The game can be passed in two hours, easily, and there is no need to ever play it again once you're done.  It's one of those games that makes you feel gypped after you've finished it.  The ending doesn't have enough Scooby flavor, and without that true Scooby Doo feel, what's the point of playing the game?  I am positive that the first level boss fight was taken straight from an old Rugrats games.  The lack of effort on this title shows.  If you are a true fan of Scooby Doo, just turn on the Cartoon Network.  Don't waste your time on this waste of time.", "date": "Nov 17, 2001"}
