Big Air is the company's own take on the extreme sport, and enters a pretty darn crowded genre on the PlayStation. One must ask, what does Accolade's game have that we can't get elsewhere?  For Big Air, The Pitbull Syndicate heads up yet another Accolade PlayStation development. And  surprise  it's utilizing an enhanced version of the team's Test Drive engine. But this time, it's tuned for the sport of snowboarding. And with all the sub-standard snowboard games mucking up the PlayStation library this year (read Freestyle Boardin', Rushdown, Cool Boarders 3), it's hoped that someone could get the game right. Big Air is a near miss. Gameplay  Big Air features a multitude of events, including Freeride Racing and Trick modes, as well as a World Tour mode that spans your snowboarding race across all six of the game's locations. Big Air mode tests your ability to perform as many tricks as you can off of a major ski jump, and of course, there's the traditional Half-Pipe level, which unfortunately just seems to be thrown in there  it's unbalanced and is executed very sloppily. You can pick from a multitude of real-life snowboarders, give them appropriate, licensed clothing and snowboards. Variety is certainly a big part of Big Air.  Controls are simple if you're just looking to shush down the slopes  but rather complex if you want to pull off all the tricks in the game. It supports the left analog stick for maneuvering your snowboarder, but it really doesn't seem to make much of a difference between that and the standard digital pad. However, it doesn't feel like your connected to your boarder  he looks like he's floating over the snow instead of sledding into it.   Big Air also has a two-player splitscreen mode where you race against your buddy  and the framerate doesn't suffer much at all. The vertical splitscreen seems very fitting for snowboarding, since you're obviously trying to see more of what's coming up than what's on either side of you.  Big Air's huge downside: the loadtimes in the game are absolutely obnoxious. If you want to restart a race, the same exact track you've just finished, wham. Loading level. Granted, the entire level doesn't stay in memory all at once  because of the Test Drive engine, the game ~spools~ data as you progress down the slope. However, on short tracks like the Big Air jumps or the half-pipe (levels which are barely a fraction of the length of the race courses), you still have to wait through abysmally long loadtimes to start over again. Damn the memory limitations and CD format  -- and damn the poorly-optimized data management of the game. Graphics  You can really see where the Test Drive engine is being used in Big Air. Many of the same minor clipping problems of Test Drive pop up with the same frequency in the snowboarding game. Heck, the framerate and texture quality of Big Air is strikingly similar to the road racing game.   The camera perspective behind the boarder is pretty standard, but after a race, kick it into Instant Replay to really see where the energy goes. The developers threw in some great camera angles and fish-eye lenses that'll make even the most horrendous run down the slope look like master work. Sound  Accolade's been really into getting name bands in its games, and Big Air is no exception. Right from the get-go, your ears are bombarded with the driving tunes from bands such as Blink 182, Diesel Boy, and Snuff. You're going to hear styles that range from ska to thrash. Let's just hope your tastes in music are somewhat open.   And what's more, the music drowns out most of the other audio in the game. But you can turn it off if you don't want to listen to any of the tunes. But in all honesty, I think the music adds to the game's energy.   I was a little worried popping this disc into the PlayStation. There wasn't much effort made by Accolade in marketing Big Air  heck, we never saw a single version of the game in action since E3 in 1998. But I have to say, while the game is far from perfect, it's turned out much better than I thought. I don't think I'll play this game much since I'd rather play 1080 on the N64, but for a PlayStation offering, it's slightly above average.My biggest problem with the game are the obnoxious loading screens. I never thought I'd have to sit through so many of them. Let's hope when The Pitbull Syndicate works on another PlayStation title (as of this writing, its next game is Demolition Racer) that it optimizes its load management a little better.It's slim pickings when it comes to snowboarding games on the PlayStation, and Big Air offers one more choice  it's not the best, but it's by far not the worst.", "date": "Mar 31, 1999"}
