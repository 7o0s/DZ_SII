You meet a bunch of other people at a bar, restaurant or cemetery and you have a very limited amount of time to introduce yourself and chat before moving on to the next person. It's basically a conveyor belt of singles too lazy to actually take the time and try and meet someone decent in the produce aisle of the grocery store. With Longtail Studios' HurryDate's SpeedDaters, you too can experience the frustration and excitement that comes with a two minute date.    You can choose to play as a girl or a guy. Being the 100% man-beefcake that I am, I of course chose to play as the guy and capture the heart of every virtual woman thrown in front of me. So this review will come from the guy's perspective. When I get a sex change, I'll write another review from the female's perspective. (Or I can ask Levi to do it.) The game consists of four areas with four girls you'll meet in each area. Each girl has three stages you'll go thru. Don't worry; you have a teacher who shows you how to get thru the complications of meeting a stranger for the first time.   First is the introduction stage. You meet your potential partner and engage in conversation. During the conversation, she will judge you on body language, eye contact and how well you listen to her. This is done via mini games. For body language, four to six different pictures will show up. Memorize each picture before one disappears. Pick the correct one that disappeared to continue the conversation in your favor. Eye contact is a maze game. From the four choices available to you, pick the right numbered path that leads to her eyes and not to her... other body parts. This game may seem confusing at first, but if you follow the path backwards starting from her eyes, you can get right to the correct number. You have to be quick though, because you have a limited amount of time. The listening game requires you choose the correct icon of yourself after she has sent several sound waves to each icon. Pick the correct icon that has three sound waves. Do well and she'll be interested in a second date.   After your conversation, you'll be able to write a note about how you think you did with each girl. I usually just chose the first option because it's pretty difficult to screw up in this game. You get to choose two out of the four women you spoke to to continue your quest for love. That's right. You get to pick which virtual girl you think is the hottest and easiest to get. Yes, it's weird. And yes, there's no shame in admitting you secretly enjoy it.     The second stage is your date. You'll engage in conversation but instead of mini-games, you'll have to pick the correct dialogue tab to try and win her over. Do good and olive icons will show up on the top of the screen. Get three olives and you're in the clear. You can also earn up to two bonus olives which means this chick is ready to jump all over your Qwerty keyboard.   The third and final stage is you winning over your girl. Based on the previous stages and how you think she wants to proceed, you can choose to go for a fling, a relationship or a commitment. Do well in the mini games you played in the first stage to get your date to kiss you and win your heart.   Once you've beaten the Story Mode, Don Juan Mode opens up. This mode allows you to go thru all of the girls in the game to try and win them over. Get 100% in all of the areas, and you are a true Don Juan.   The dialogue in the game is clever. Some of the double-entendres are rather funny and each girl has her own distinct personality. Some of them are rough, some are sweet and some are just plain naughty. The game has sixteen different girls and all look different but for some reason the game was suspiciously absent of blondes because I only remember there being one. Maybe the programmers just like brunettes?   The graphics are well done but very static. You'll only be looking at the upper half of your character and your dates. You never see a kiss or hand-holding or animated movements like what my dates end up doing to me, which is slapping me in the face and walking away. The girls kind of all look the same, body- and age-wise. I would have liked to have seen a better mix of women. And I feel really, really creepy having just written that.  This is a light and quirky dating game thats easy to beat in just a few hours and plays better in spurts than over a long stretch. The dialogue was good but I would have liked to have seen more variety in the girls and perhaps some options as to what you will actually do on your date instead of just talk. But its a good stepping stone in the right dating direction for gamers who like playing the virtual field.", "date": "Mar 27, 2008"}
