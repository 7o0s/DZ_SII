That's right, you'd be purchasing Soul Calibur, Sonic Adventure, NFL2K, PowerStone, and Ready 2 Rumble, and maybe something alternative, like Tokyo Xtreme Racer.  Well, add another title to your list.  Hydro Thunder is not only one of the best looking Dreamcast games I've seen thus far, but it's also one of the most enjoyable, longest lasting titles in the Dreamcast's launch lineup.  In Hydro Thunder, you select from one of three tracks, select from one of three speed boats, and head out to race.  Placing third in all three tracks will gain you access to three harder tracks, and three more powerful boats.  Placing second in these three tracks will gain you access to three even harder tracks and three even more powerful boats.  Place first in these three super-difficult tracks, and you'll race on four bonus tracks.  Do the math, and you'll discover no less than thirteen tracks, and nine boats.  What's surprising is that these tracks are all unique, differing both in graphical style, and layout.  Midway apparently wasn't content with merely taking one environment and creating a bunch of different paths through it.  Nope, their graphics designers worked overtime, creating such diverse environments as Thunder Park, a race through an amusement park in San Diego, California, and The Arctic Circle, which starts you off in a small fisher's village and ends up in the ocean, near a passenger ocean liner.  All the tracks are filled with twists, turns, shortcuts, and ramps, and all are designed with realism taken over the top.  For instance, my favorite track would have to be New York Disaster, which imagines what would happen if New York City were flooded with water.  You happen to be racing through the city on your speed boats, and you'll notice street signs and submerged taxi cabs; you'll go through subway tunnels, and end up near the base of a collapsed Statue of Liberty.       There's plenty of detail in the tracks, and the Dreamcast handles it all with little apparent trouble.  You'll see the most beautiful water since Wave Race 64, with buildings and cars submerged beneath, along with huge mountainsides, giant sheets of ice, and unbelievably detailed trackside objects.  If the large ocean-liner near the Statue of Liberty in New York Disaster is supposed to be the Titanic, then James Cameron himself would be proud.  And if your jaw doesn't drop when your boat leaps off its first cliff enroute to a splashdown hundreds of feet below, I don't know what kind of games you've been playing, but I'd like to see 'em!  The little bits of slowdown here and there aren't even worth mentioning, as they do little to detract from the overall graphical splendor.    One of the coolest things regarding the tracks is the audio.  The music is, with exception to a few memorable pieces, somewhat indistinct, but the soundeffects and voices are top notch.  Each track actually has a police boat which appears about midway through the race.  It will persue you for a quarter of the track, shouting out culturally appropriate threats; in Venice, for instance, the police speaks . . . uhh, whatever language they speak in Venice; in New York, you'll hear the police speak with a New York accent (you just know the Midway designers were hoping to make this guy swear like a madman).  Beyond the police boats, you'll also hear comments from the few passenger boats you'll encounter on certain tracks; I guarantee you'll laugh outloud when you hear the squeal from any of these boats once you've knocked them out.  The boats you control are just as unique as the tracks.  They all have a different feel and maximum speed, and mastering a boat is essential for doing good in the game.  I think my favorite boat would have to be ~Damn the Torpedoes,~ probably because of its name more than anything else.  Each boat can be made to accelerate and break, of course, but you can do a lot more once you've obtained ~Turbo~ power up items.  Availaible in both 4-second and 9-second variety, these items can be accumulated and used to give your boat a burst of turbo speed.  You can also use the turbos to make the boat jump into the air from anywhere.  You can only store a certain amount of turbo in your boat (about 18 seconds), and I've found that knowing when to use the turbo is essential to victory.   It also turns out the collecting turbos is half the fun of the game.  Midway has placed the turbos all over the tracks, and they were quite clever in this respect.  You'll see, for instance, a 4-second turbo, and will move your boat in its direction, only to miss a 9-second turbo that hadn't been visible at the time; of course, the next time you race through the track, you'll know better.  You'll also find the turbos in places that are apparently impossible to reach.  I'm pretty sure that it's possible to reach all of them, though (although, I'm still having difficult with some), and you'll have to be on the lookout for secret paths in order to obtain everything and get your race time up.       Add to this an enjoyable (though unrefined) two player split screen mode, and perfect, simplified control over the boats, and you have all the makings for a classic.  In fact, the only real problems I have with the game involve its interface.  There are quite a few, though, and they do, unfortunately, manage to get in the way of the fun.  The problem seems to be that the interface is just too simple for a home game.  All you can do is select a track, then select a boat, then you're off to race.  There's no free-run mode, and no way to set the number of laps in your race - things that have become the norm in most racing games that come out of Japan (I've noticed that few European racers use the free run mode - this needs to be changed).  In all honesty, the tracks are so utterly long that one lap is just about perfect, but the free run mode is sorely needed, as it's useful for experimentation.  The biggest problem with the interface is probably its most subtle, though.  Say moments into the start of a race, you run into a wall and decide that you'd like to start over.  You press start, but the only two options available to you are to continue with the race, or to exit to the title screen!.  That's right, there's no way to restart the race quickly (despite the fact that you'll probably be using the same boat and the same track), and no way to select an option to jump back to the boat selection screen or the track selection screen.  This problem is compounded by the fact that going from the title screen to the options screen to the track selection screen to the boat selection screen to the actual start of the race is a lengthy process, due primarily to the game's severe load time.  It's a shame really, as some may just grow tired of the game and decide to stop playing.  Other interface problems include the lack of an auto-save/auto-load feature for the VMU, the annoying overuse of the jump pack (don't hit a wall at the end of a race, as the controller will continue to shake until the score screen has loaded), the absolutely ugly title screen, and the lack of music for the menu, track selection, and boat selection screens.  These interface issues reek of a rushed product, and maybe a few more weeks would have done wonders in giving us a more appropriate home-based Hydro Thunder.  Still, I can't deny that once you get into the race, you'll probably be having a tremendous amount of fun - so much fun, in fact, that you'll find yourself looking past the interface issues just so that you can race again.  There's a lot to do in Hydro Thunder, and a lot of fun to be had.  I'd suggest you add this to your Dreamcast collection.   -- Anoop Gantayat, who lost his turbo, then lost the race, then cried and cried, 'till he was red in the face.", "date": "Sep 8, 1999"}
