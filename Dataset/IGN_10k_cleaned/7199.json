Smash! Ker-pow! I love the sound of fighting games in the morning  or any other time of day, for that matter. So it was with much joy that I sat down to play Capcom's latest addition to the almost maddening catalog of brawlers available for PlayStation, the almost tongue-twistingly named Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter. (Let's just be happy it didn't add an ~EX,~ ~Alpha,~ or ~Champion Edition~ to the title.)  Having only spent a few brief sessions with the arcade version of MSH vs. SF in the arcade, I wasn't really sure what to expect. Would it be just like X-Men vs. Street Fighter? Would the problems faced by the PlayStation port of said title resurface? Will these guys ever run out of ideas for 2D fighters? While that last question remains unanswered, the first two were surprisingly simple. Yes, it's a lot like XM vs. SF, and no, it doesn't quite succumb to the PlayStation's hardware limitations like its predecessor.  Just like Capcom's previous versus title, MSH vs. SF relies on thrill-a-second, screen-filling super moves and special effects to get the job done. And it does the job well. The game is fast, furious, and surprisingly well-animated given the constraints that must be worked within. Sadly, however, Capcom wasn't able to implement one of the arcade version's most notable facets: True tag-team gameplay, wherein players can instantly switch between two characters during a match. Instead, it opted to make the quirky trade-off method of tag-team play found in the PlayStation port of XM vs. SF a standard game mode, but alas, it never quite matches up to the real thing.  While there's no denying that MSG vs. SF is a fast, fun, and solid fighting game, it certainly isn't without flaws. The aforementioned lack of true tag-team play is one that will seriously affect players who are used to the arcade version, and, as a consequence, also negates one of the major elements that made the versus series stand apart from every other Capcom 2D fighter. Without it, the game is, by and large, faster and more over-the-top version of Street Fighter  not to say that's bad, it's just nothing truly special or different.  End the end, I must admit that I had a lot of fun with MSH vs. SF  but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to those who didn't enjoy XM vs. SF, or are looking for something truly innovative from their next fighting game.
