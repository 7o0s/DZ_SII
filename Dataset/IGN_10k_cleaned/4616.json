While the name might not be a company that immediately springs to mind when you think of the top wireless developers, each of their games from licensed fare like Pitfall: The Lost Expedition to original titles such as the Zoy's Rescue Mission games ooze personality. Like Nintendo, or smaller dev houses like Denki, Ltd. there's just something inviting about the worlds Sumea creates, and charming about both their graphics and design. And although it comes off a bit empty, their recent title Yo-Yo Fighter is a decent entry into the Sumea catalog.   Features:  Unique yo-yo battle action  17 platforming levels  Hidden powerups and extra lives  Info-blocks for extra hints and tips  <lilbig boss finale yes as you could probably infer from the title Yo-Yo Fighter involves taking out enemies with a trusty stringed children's toy. You control Yozo, who looks like an extra from the movie Rollerball. You must scour the World of Stone to recover your pal Jaco (no, not that Jacko) from the clutches of a tyrannous stone golem. Along the way you trigger switches and take out various bats and creatures to progress toward the end of each area.   I've personally found that platformers are a difficult genre to pull off on current wireless technology, due to the cumbersome input most phones rely on. Even on units with more game-friendly design such as Nokia's N-Gage, wireless gaming just isn't at that point yet where games that rely on quick D-pad reflexes work effectively. This is why so many wireless platformers seem to bite off more than they can chew, while slower fare like puzzles and shooters garner the best reviews year after year. Well for better of worse, Sumea has definitely taking this into consideration with Yo-Yo, one of the slowest-moving platformers we've ever seen.   This is not necessarily a bad thing. Slow movement for both Yozo and his enemies gives the player time to think out their moves, without the constant frustration of fight-or-flight. It's like taking part in a drag race at 20 miles per hour - it's not the most exciting exercise, but you're more likely to finish in one piece. Jumping in the game has been split into a right-jump and left-jump, and all platforms in the game are spaced meticulously so that you can hop any pit with a single leap, no running required.   If this is starting to sound boring, your yo-yo adds some flavor to the mix. The hero has an unlimited supply of stringed whoop-ass for the variety of enemies he encounters. Rather than aiming and timing his attacks with jumps, however the game utilizes a lock-on system so that whichever enemy is closest will be highlighted with red crosshairs. Pressing the action button will sling the yo-yo at the targeted enemy. Different enemies can take different amount of damage before being destroyed, and some enemies protect themselves, forcing the player to time their attacks for when the enemy is vulnerable. And because of the slow retract speed of the weapon, timing a sling incorrectly means you'd better run or that enemy you missed will be right on top of you.   The sound is effective, but feels sparse and random. The songs that play at the title screen and as you begin certain levels work very well, but you'll spend most of the game playing in dead silence, devoid of any sound effects as well. Why the developers chose to tease their audience with songs that pop up and then dissolve mid-level is beyond me.    The graphics on the other hand are fantastic. Expect no mind-blowing polygons or mesmerizing effects here (although the yo-yo string physics can be pretty cool). What you get are solid, charming sprites on par with the best that wireless gaming has to offer. Although they have a catalog filled with both hits and misses, Sumea's games are never lacking in beautiful, colorful graphics. Yo-Yo's title image sets the style for the game and enemies, while not incredibly detailed, exude as much personality as the best of the Gameboy Advance. Little extras such as chatting portrait pics give the game a very complete feel.   Also included are little ~?~ blocks in the game which, as you step over them describe gameplay mechanics and level objectives in little bursts. These keep the game moving yet clearly understandable, a nice little on-the-run tutorial system. The game as a whole seems to be geared toward a younger crowd and taking that into consideration, it's nice to see a wireless title that doesn't immediately punish the player for lack of lightning-fast reflexes.   Where the game starts looking less impressive is that aside from walking, jumping, yo-yo-ing and a short stint with rocket boots, there's not a lot to do here. Enemies lurch toward you without much intensity, and even if they are fast, there's usually at least one safe area nearby like a ledge to just wait on until you have a clear shot at them. It would have been great to take the yo-yo system further and use it for swinging around, or something more active than just popping switches and enemies. When you die, you can begin again where you left off, which makes blasting through each of the short seventeen levels a breeze. And fighting the golem at the game's climax was a treat, but it's still just one boss in the entire game, who can be beaten without much strategy.  If you're looking for a game with posterity that's exciting, cross Yo-Yo Fighter off your list. In many ways it feels like a half-finished demo, an interesting little world left half-filled, almost as if another hero had already blazed through everything and Yozo is left wandering about the vacant ruins of a more exciting game. The graphics and presentation are solid throughout, and while I feel somewhat compelled to suggest picking up another, deeper Sumea game instead of this one, Yo-Yo Fighter is readily available through T-Mobile's game selection and I feel satisfied with what I got for my five bucks. It's not the best game on my phone, but it's something worth having on there to kill some time now and again.This game was reviewed on a Nokia 3650 phone.
