Majesco finally releases the very simple and addictive puzzle game stateside, and while it's not going to exactly set the world ablaze with an elaborate design, Denki Blocks is very challenging with a lot of different modes to play. Features 270 different single-player puzzles Multiplayer support on a single system Cartridge save (three character slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  One of the biggest things I dread when reviewing games is explaining how puzzle games work. And I think I have my work cut out for me with Denki Blocks; as simplistic as the concept is, I doubt there's any way I can accurately explain how the gameplay works. But here goes:  In Denki Blocks, players are given the task of linking same-colored blocks to one another by sliding the entire playfield of colored blocks. All of the blocks will slide in unison unless they're stopped by A) one of the four edges of the playscreen, B) Other blocks of different colors, or C) Dead, stationary blocks. It's up to the player to utilize the edges, other colors, and stationary blocks to maneuver the blocks around each other. The goal is to solidify all the colors by linking like-colors together. Each puzzle has its own specific challenge, and some levels are over simply by completing one color, even if there are three different colors on-screen. The game calculates how many moves and how much time the player took to complete that challenge. Players can earn bonus tokens by creating a specific shape that's shown on the side of the screen during the challenge...and these tokens can be used to unlock absolutely vicious hidden puzzles.  This game idea isn't complex by any means, but the developers worked so many different and fun game options using this design. There are several single player modes, including a tournament mode where players meet cute little characters who have their own set challenges to complete. After these characters are found, they can be challenged in several different Versus Battle modes. One mode puts two, three or four players against each other in a race to solve five puzzles first, represented by a cute little track on the right side of the screen. In another, players try to out do the other with the same blocks by creating a shape that would take the other person a long time to figure out. These modes can be played against human opponents as well, but the strange thing is, this cartridge doesn't support the GBA's link cable mode; all Versus modes have to be done via the ~hot seat,~ passing the system to the next person when it's his turn. This game would have been awesome as a single-cartridge multiplayer game on multiple systems, especially since the art style and music isn't very complex.  The cartridge has memory save to record each player's unlocked puzzles and earned tokens; unfortunately, this save doesn't keep track of top scores or times in any of the puzzles in the game. There are a ton of puzzles, though, so keeping track of all that data might be asking for a bit much in a half-kilobyte save file, but still...puzzle games need some sort of brag wall for records. Denki Blocks is a lot of fun and one hell of a mind twister. There are so many challenges that puzzle fans will be playing this one for weeks before most of them have been solved. The multiplayer modes are also a lot of fun, but it's incredibly disappointing to learn that this game doesn't support the link cable; the graphic style is fun and simplistic, which makes it perfect for the GBA's multi-boot feature. The hotseat multiplayer is acceptable, but it would have been much more fun and involving if other systems could join in on the fun. Overall, Denki Blocks is a wonderful puzzle game that fits the handheld market well...even with its multiplayer and data saving limitations.", "date": "Dec 10, 2002"}
