The company has just re-issued the Game Boy version of Pac-Man with a Game Boy Color palette and an additional game. This new package is called Pac-Man: Special Color Edition, and if you've ever been a fan of the yellow being, you're going to have even more good times with this pocket version. Features Arcade translation of Pac-Man and a Game Boy conversion of Pac-Attack. Link cable support for two players Password for Pac-Attack. For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  Do I really have to explain what Pac-Man is? (ed.: Yes.) Oh, come on, everyone knows what this game's about. (ed.: I don't care.) Fine. Sheesh. You control a yellow guy and eat lots of dots and try and clear a maze full of dots and try to avoid ghosts and sometimes you can eat the ghosts but only temporarily. There. Happy? (ed.: Yes.).  Anyway, the Game Boy Color version of  Pac-Man is nearly arcade perfect, but not exact. Obviously, the main drawback is the Game Boy Color screen  not enough pixels to accurately represent the arcade machine. That's okay, Namco made a near pixel-to-pixel translation that scrolls to follow Pac-Man along in the maze. You can also opt for a full-screen mode to see everything, but the detail on the Pac-Man and the ghosts suffer big time. The maze that was created for the Game Boy Color version is exactly the same as the arcade, but the dot count of the Game Boy Color version slightly less than the original. Also, the ghosts' eyes look in the direction they're moving, but don't change just before they turn a corner, like they do in arcade version. Without this little hint, you remove a tiny bit of strategy from the game. The pace of the game is just a tad slower than the arcade, too...but that's not terribly noticeable.  Probably the coolest feature of this version of Pac-Man is the two-player link mode. In it, you and your opponent control Pac-Man on completely separate boards. The deal is, whenever you eat a ghost, it gets sent over to his board instead of staying on yours. So you can essentially wind up with as many as eight ghosts on your maze, or as few as none. It's a great game option that probably won't be used much, but it's still cool to see Namco add this feature.  The second part of Pac-Man: Special Color Edition is the addition of Pac-Attack, a Tetris-style puzzle title featuring Pac-Man and ghosts as tile pieces. This game came out in 1993 for the Super NES and Genesis, and now you can give it a shot on Nintendo's portable.  The idea is to fit falling groups of bricks and ghosts in such a way that a line of bricks will disappear, much like Tetris. Ghosts will only disappear if eaten by a Pac-Man tile. The Pac-Man tile will move in the direction he's pointing, and eat ghosts until it reaches a dead-end  then it disappears, and the rest of the pile falls into place. It's a clever puzzle game, but it's no Tetris. It's a great inclusion, though, and makes the cartridge that much more of a worthwhile purchase. Because the game is Pac-Man, you're only going to get one maze that increases in speed and difficulty. This isn't Ms. Pac-Man with its multiple mazes, so keep that in mind when picking it up. Pac-Man is a classic, and definitely worth a purchase  but make sure you realize that it's not a game with a ton of variety. The two player mode and Pac-Attack are the icing on the cake  these two items make Pac-Man: Special Color Edition a fine addition to your Game Boy collection.", "date": "Sep 4, 1999"}
