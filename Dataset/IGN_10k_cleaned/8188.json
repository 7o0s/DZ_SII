I know what you're saying. You're saying, ~Steve, what's up with the title? Why isn't it SimTower2 or SimTower3000? What gives?~ Well, I'm glad you asked. This is a Sim game in everything but name. You see, Yoot Tower is published by Sega PC, and Sega doesn't own the rights to the Sim name. That's a Maxis property. So basically, this is a Sim game but it's just got a different name because it has a different publisher than SimCity, SimFarm, SimAnt, SimGym or SimSaladbar.  It is still the product of the genius behind SimTower, Yoot Saito. He conceived of a sequel to SimTower nearly three years ago. He wanted to bring a new environment and story to the tower. To that end he has shifted the focus of the game somewhat. The game is now more about the inhabitants of the tower. They play a bigger role in the story than they did in the previous incarnation of this title. From what I understand there are also some cosmetic differences to the game, but I don't really see them. And I used to be a big SimTower junkie.  Saito had some broad and ambitious design strategies for this title. First and foremost he wanted to capture the living essence of the tower better than he had in SimTower. To this end, he reworked the two main dynamics of the game-traffic and happiness. Traffic control is now more crucial than ever in success and growth of your tower. The idea is to divert traffic from residential and office areas to shops and restaurants. High traffic in those areas can still cause stress on your occupants, but it yields massive profits for the stores. You will use elevators and escalators to direct traffic just like in the old game. Now you also have access to larger elevators and skybridges. Skybridges create a walkway between separate towers.  There are more ways to affect the occupants' happiness too. The occupants are in a happy mood by default. Any problems they encounter in your tower make them less happy. If they become unhappy enough, they will leave. Factors that cause unhappiness include traffic congestion, high commercial and residential prices and poor service. Any of these factors will drive your tenants into apoplexy. And that's not good. Who wants a whole bunch of apoplectic tenants?  Yoot Tower is also designed for open expandability. This is handled through upgrades called plug-ins. Each of the three maps that ship with the game has a unique set of plug-ins. These are special items that can only be used on that map. The tower at Waikiki has a boatdock, for instance. The Tokyo tower can support subway connections. There are plans in the works right now for future maps and plug-ins but no one at Sega knows yet how these will be offered. They may be downloadable or sold as expansion packs. Either way, it offers a new avenue to increase later interest in the game.  It goes without saying that Saito also wanted a game that was easy to learn yet difficult to master. And he's got it. Yoot Tower is incredibly easy to learn. The interface is simple and intuitive. Like Saito's other games this simplicity is only skin deep. Beneath the surface of the interface lies a complex and intricate world. Every decision and action has wide-ranging repercussions. Change the price of a gyro or add an escalator and the whole tower changes in subtle ways. Sometimes the changes are not so subtle. Sort of the whole butterfly wing-hurricane thing that the chaos theory guys are always blabbing about.  The objective in Yoot Tower is the same as in the other Sim titles. There is none. The maintenance and growth of the tower is your only concern. As a structure it is constantly changing and adapting to your actions. There is a five star rating system for towers that does give the game a benchmark, but this is by no means the only reason to play. You start as a one star tower. More stars are added at certain population levels, or after a favorable VIP visit. As you get more stars, you'll have access to more types businesses and services in the tower. Development in the game is open-ended. There's always something you can do to make your tenants happier than they currently are. And you can always try to get more tenants.  To this end, you can apply a few basic strategies. First and foremost you'll need to balance the various components of your tower. Place the commercial, office and residential sections of your structure so that you can maximize happiness and profit for all concerned. The businesses are all fairly complex. It's not enough to place a restaurant in your tower. You have to pick the right kind of restaurant for the structure. In an office environment, simplicity is key. Workers might want to eat fast and cheap so they can continue working. This is a Japanese game after all. You would put an entirely different type of restaurant in a hotel. You also control prices and menus for all of your establishments.  This level of control does tend to bog you down. When you are addressing the traffic flow patterns, you are also neglecting the price structures within the tower. When you focus on phasing out the sale of passport photos, you're ignoring the constant sanitation and health problems. This micro-management is also the main strength of the game, though. It means that there's always something else to take care of. And each solution leads to fresh problems in other areas.  There are too many individual structures in Yoot Tower to list here. Apart from the various restaurants and shops, hotels and condominiums, you'll need to find room for building services. These range from security stations to garbage centers to restrooms. Each is absolutely essential to the smooth functioning of your tower (although if it comes down to it, I think I'd worry about the restrooms first; you don't want people peeing in the trashcans do you?). There are also various, so-called city services. You'll need to provide schools and doctor offices for some of your tenants. They'd also like a movie theater. You'll have a few types of these to choose from as well.  There are various events that can occur as you play. Some are good, some are bad. Among the best of the good is finding treasure in the foundation of your tower. This adds immediately to your cash and is most, most helpful. You can also receive a visit from Mamu the Dog. If he comes to live in your tower, he will begin to attract visitors. And these visitors stay and spend cash.  Your tower can also experience a cold epidemic. The consequence of forcing 1000 people to live together under one roof is increased vulnerability to disease. Once a cold catches hold of the tenants, it can be a long time before you're back to normal operation levels. You'll also have to juggle the responsibilities of CEO while battling terrorists, fires and power outages. On the subject of battling terrorists, I can't wait to see if Sega releases a Streets of SimCity type game for Yoot Tower. They could make it like Rainbow Six...or at least like Elevator Action. I can dream can't I?  As your tower grows you'll have need of the various graphic reports in the game. These are pretty simplistic by SimCity standards, but they are still useful. You can see traffic patterns that will help you identify problem areas. You can view tenant happiness and rental rates at a glance. Here's a hint-they're usually inversely proportional. You can also name the individual tenants. This allows you to see where they go and what they do. As you follow the individuals around, you'll begin to get a better idea of how and why your tower works. From this knowledge, you can plan future development strategies.  Yoot Tower ships with three locations and plug-ins. The first and most flexible of these is Tokyo. This site has the potential to be a huge, 100-story office building. The best thing about this map is that you'd have to beat the customers away with a stick. They'd probably still come back. You'll want to add offices and single hotel rooms for travelling business men and women. The biggest obstacle to this map is its huge size. Figuring out the elevator system for a 100 floor tower is a nightmare.  In contrast to the corporate nature of the Tokyo tower is the Kegon Falls resort. This is a getaway spot for tourists. As such, you'll benefit most from restaurants and stores that appeal to vacationers. Watch out for the off-season slump, however. It can really bite you in the ass if you're not prepared. Make sure that your tower can run profitably during all seasons. Ironically, this smaller tower has elevator problems too because the average length of stay is so short.  A bonus Waikiki site is included as well. This is a fancy Hawaiian hotel. Stock it with family sized hotel rooms and crappy gift shops and watch the mainlanders' cash roll in. And if you put an office here cause you think it'd be cool to work on your vacation, give us a call. IGNPC is looking for someone just like you. Then they could replace our sorry asses with productive people like yourself.  Although the game looks and plays a lot like SimTower, it's got some new elements. Unfortunately, this is the type of game that requires hours and hours of play to truly appreciate. As with all of Saito-san's games, this one is nearly infinitely deep and engaging and I look forward to unlocking more secrets of Yoot Tower in the weeks to come.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "May 20, 1999"}
