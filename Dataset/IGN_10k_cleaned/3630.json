It manifests itself in different ways, like in the people who mug others, who run oil companies, and who sell Castles & Catapults to an unsuspecting public. The fun thing about crime is that it always keeps up with the time. New gadgets are unleashed to move past security, understanding of electronics can keep high tech crooks out of jail, and best of all, like the money and information flowing across the net, crime is no longer confined to the substantial world of steel vaults and trigger happy policemen. No, a smart and educated man or woman can notch out a nifty little life subsisting on hacking into the Internet, which is quickly becoming something most world leaders are depending on. Uplink: Hacker Elite explores this growing electronic opportunity in what is certainly a unique and interesting title that will keep wannabe computer hackers enthralled for hours. Real hackers need not apply, your job is probably much more fun to you than this game would be.   While most people will immediately point out the fact that Uplink does not have state of the art graphics with the grandest and most fantabuloso 3D engine, I'd argue that its simplicity works to its advantage. Having seen hacker movies or movies with hackers in them or just plain movies with computers in them, I can say I've never seen interfaces so slick on anybody's actual computer screen. So jumping into this interface was a lesson in elegance and immersion. Because of the way it was built, you feel like you may actually be on the Internet hacking into someone's computer. While the game is still too simple for you to really feel like a hacker, it's about as close as any of us normal folk are ever going to get to the real thing.   From the very beginning, there is no fancy intro, no hint of a huge plot to destroy the world lurking in a cutscene, just a login screen, plain and simple and inviting. In Uplink, you've been invited to be part of a worldwide hacking organization that grants its new users 3,000 dollars initial cash, a gateway computer, and access to their job board and equipment stores. You'll need to take jobs hacking into other computer systems to make money. You make money so that you can buy new upgrades to your system so that you can take bigger and more important jobs so that you can make higher sums of money which in turn allow you to upgrade your computer some more. You know the picture, you've seen it in most RPGs, only instead of weapons and armor, you have chips and wires. Along the way, you'll fall into a story as well, but the game is very freeform in its approach allowing players to take whatever missions they wish, whether they are story based or not. The time table is up to the player.   In any case, missions are begun very simply to get you accustomed to the interface. Beginning with no risk tutorial missions, you'll soon be hacking into systems to steal and erase files. You'll need different equipment to complete different tasks along the way. You'll have to use various software programs such as trace trackers, password hacks and so on in order to get through to each computer. Usually, depending on the security system on the other end, you'll begin to be tracked almost immediately upon entry. In order to counter this, you'll have to bounce your hack off of several servers around the world. You'll eventually be found, so speed is essential. That one little warning letting you know how much time you have left before you're nabbed is exciting. You'll feel your heart start to move a little faster as the clock winds down and you barely disconnect in time.   Getting caught is not a good thing. Uplink will destroy your gateway computer and disavow any knowledge of you. Which is a huge bummer. Having to start over is a pain. Especially since you can't make your own save games. So the moral of the story is don't screw up.   The tools you use and the assignments you go on vary. Sometimes you'll just be copying a file but other times you'll be erasing criminal records, changing school records, or even tracking down other hackers like yourself. While the missions definitely get more complex and quite a bit more challenging later into the game, there's no shaking the feeling that it's all a bit repetitive. I can't say I wasn't having a good time playing the game, but the same basic pattern to most missions remained. The reward to doing all of this is of course the cash allowing you to upgrade the security around your own system, as well as add memory upgrades (which allow more complex programs and larger amounts of data to be stolen), and buy new versions of hacking paraphernalia. It's fun to strive to be the best in this game, but the fun will eventually run out.Uplink: Hacker Elite is a fun little game and one that can be played for pretty short amounts at a time as a good distraction. It isn't one of those games that will keep you enthralled for hundreds of hours, but it is most certainly a great change from most of the clones that are released onto the market these days. However, if you're all about the flash and style of most strategy games and the twitchy reflexes of an FPS, this game probably isn't going to be for you.The concept and implementation behind this game is really something special. I'm not sure that it's 30 dollars worth of special, but if you see it in the bargain bin for even 20 bucks and want a shot at sneaking in and living out that criminal fantasy of yours, while still getting to be the good guy, Uplink may well find a fond place in your collection of PC games.", "date": "Apr 30, 2003"}
