Well this isn't Theme Park, and it's not from Bullfrog, even if the interface is similar and the subject matter is the same. MicroProse beat Bullfrog's Theme Park 2 to the punch with Roller Coaster Tycoon, a Chris Sawyer game.  You may remember Sawyer's previous game, Transport Tycoon. That one and his new game have a lot of similarities. Both have an isometric perspective, several levels of zoom, and involve setting up buildings and laying tracks on the quasi-3D grid. You can raise and lower ground, clear trees, dig tunnels and rotate the camera to one of four views.  But rather than manage transport lines and trains full of freight, Roller Coaster Tycoon is all about getting people into your amusement park, emptying their pockets as you show them a good time.  The economy is pretty simple to get a handle on. Park-goers come in with about $70 apiece, and you can set prices for general admission, for each different ride, and concessions like soda pop, hamburgers, park maps, and umbrellas. You can even charge people for using the rest rooms, but I wouldn't recommend charging more than a dime, or people will simply refuse to pay and make a mess outside.  Yes, a mess. The 'sims' in this game are slobs, and they'll throw their litter all over the park. Even ruder, they have a tendency to vomit in the areas right outside the roller coasters and wilder rides if you don't provide garbage cans and bathrooms. To take care of this, you'll need to hire some janitor types to patrol the park with a whiskbroom and keep things tidy.  There are three other types of employees to hire too: security guards, who will cut down on crime and vandalism; entertainers, who dress up in those ridiculous animal outfits and keep the crowds happy; and mechanics, who will check rides to try to prevent a breakdown and fix them when they do break down.  Mechanics are probably the most important, because your rides are your main source of income and main draw to your park, and without regular maintenance they will fall apart, or even have a spectacular crash. And you don't want that to happen.  The rides themselves come in several flavors--simple attractions like Ferris Wheels and Haunted Houses that don't take a lot of space and can easily be set up anywhere, and the more elaborate tracked rides, like log runs, miniature trains, monorails and of course roller coasters, that can be hand-designed to fit the local terrain or built from a default plan.   Generally you'll want to hand design your rides, but this can take a long time, and can be very frustrating until you master the interface, so in the beginning, you'll tend to use the pre-built tracks. Keep in mind that it costs money to raise and lower land, move trees, and build walkways, so making changes in your design midway through can be needlessly expensive.  But once you do figure out how to build a roller coaster, you'll realize that nothing you're likely to do any of these SimCity-type games is likely to be more fun. You'll get a lot of pride out of designing some crazy, twisting corkscrew that winds in and out of lakes and hot dog stands, painting it bright neon pink and orange, and giving it a name like the Vominator. And then when the kids start lining up for those $5 tickets, you'll be ready to start saving up for your next ridiculous extravaganza.  Roller Coaster Tycoon is, quite simply, a lot of fun.  --Jason Bates", "date": "Apr 3, 1999"}
