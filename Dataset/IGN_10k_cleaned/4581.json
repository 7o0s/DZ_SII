And after all the delays, the final product has offered us a few new surprises -- some delightful, some dreadful.   For them that don't know (and shame on you, by the way), Counter-Strike is a wildly popular online shooter built on the original Half-Life technology. Though it wasn't everyone's cup of tea, twitchy action gamers around the world loved the title. Part of the success of the game was that it was built on one of the best shooters around; part of it was that it was free to download and play. Now Valve has now released an updated version of the game that includes some new offline modes, plenty of competent bots and pretty much nothing else. And that's the real issue -- if you can see past the ~nothing else~ to appreciate the new things that the game offers.    The new offline modes of play are intended to ease players into the merciless world of online play. A series of six graded challenges takes the player through eighteen total missions. You have to complete each set of three missions before moving up to the next tier. At each new level, the challenge level increases until, by the end, even veteran Counter-Strike players will be sweating.    Each mission requires you to defuse a bomb, rescue hostages, you know, the usual Counter-Strike stuff. You're usually up against half-a-dozen or so of terrorists but you can take along some back up. There are a number of bots here that you ~buy~ to take with on a mission. Those that cost one point are pretty terrible; those that cost four points are pretty damn good. Each comes rated in a number of areas: skill, bravery and teamwork, and has a preferred weapon. I'd really like to have seen an extra option that allows you to buy specific equipment for your team but there's a nice range of weapons at all point levels so you can create the team that suits you.   At the most basic level, you'll need to win at least two more matches than your opponents in order to complete a level. But things don't end there. Each level also has a few specific challenges (geared towards the difficulty level) that you must complete. On some levels, you may have to win a round within a certain amount of time; on others you may have to kill a certain number of enemies with a particular weapon. These go a long way towards adding a new level of sophistication to the game but some of the challenges seem kind of arbitrary. It's not like the sniping challenge takes place on a level particularly suited to sniping, for instance.   There are a few other issues with these challenges. For one thing, in missions where you have to rescue hostages, you get no credit for rescuing hostages once all the members of the opposing team are dead. So you could be on your last hostage run and wind up having to do the whole damn thing over again because one of your buddies killed the last tango. Contrast that with the bomb-defusing missions where, even if the enemy force has been wiped out, you still have to track down the bomb and defuse it in order to claim a victory. It seems like a fair compromise would be to give the player credit for any hostages ~in tow~ when the last enemy drops.    I might also add, on the subject of hostage rescue, that it would be really helpful if the hostages knew how to climb ladders. While it's funny to watch them spin around at the bottom of a ladder, it ain't gonna win you any matches.    But the big advancement here is the new Counter Strike bot, an offline, AI-run character that supposedly stands in for a real, human player. At first, I wasn't too impressed with these guys. Not only did they fail to do even the simplest things -- they often ruined my own attempts to beat the level. But that's merely the result of a graded difficulty. Once you get past the first few levels, you'll find that the friendly and enemy AI start to present some really interesting and successful behaviors.   It almost turned me completely off the game. My own friendly forces would frequently fail to disarm bombs even after all the terrorists had been killed. Watching in spectator mode (yes, even at this simplistic level, I died a few times) I would scream obscenities and beat things on my desk when my own teammates snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. It's not unlike the sensation I get when playing Rainbow Six alongside some of our stupider editors. Out of professional respect, I won't call anyone out here but send me some cash and I'll start naming names.   Once you get past the first and second level teammates, you'll find your friends are much more reliable.  They still miss grenade tosses, landing them right at your feet at exactly the wrong time, but since they're intended to represent human players, I'm not so sure this is a weakness. Some of my own teammates spent far too much time staring directly at a wall but, once they begin moving, they actually make some intelligent decisions including camping along paths that the enemy will have to cross.   There's also a Deleted Scene mode that offers up more tightly scripted, story-driven action through a variety of special ops missions. But even as you take on the challenges as a SEAL, Spetznaz, or Delta Force operative, you'll find that the highly linear and scripted nature of the missions is totally at odds with the fluidity and improvisation that makes the basic version of the game so fun. Sure, you get some new objectives now and then in the middle of a mission, but it still seems too predictable. It's a real shame, because these Deleted Scenes offer a narrative context (however flimsy it might be) that is missing from the rest of the game. It also offers a few weapons that you don't get anywhere else, but these are usually provided for specific moments within the mission and would be a bit too powerful for play in the online arenas.   So that's it for new things. Getting back to the ~been there, done that~ impression that this game creates, I'm genuinely confused that there aren't more improvements in terms of graphics. Five years ago, this would have been a good looking game. By today's standards, after the improvements seen in Medal of Honor, Max Payne and Far Cry, it's hard to enjoy games built on the original Half-Life engine. The textures are probably the best thing about the engine at this point and even they're just a bit above average.   The blocky player models are bad enough. Add in Doom-like gib effects, a single skin for the hostages (Hey! I'm rescuing the INSERT NAME OF HILARIOUS QUADRUPLETS here!), and some generic animations and you've got a title that stands out simply because it doesn't live up to the standards set by the current crop of shooters. The one upside to all this is that the game runs beautifully on older systems.    While the quality of the audio is merely average, it's put to good use here. Nice positional audio tips you off to enemy movement and weapons fire. Better still, your teammates will tell you what's going on. Hearing one guy say, ~I'm going to camp bomb site A,~ and then hearing another guy say, ~Me too,~ I genuinely cool. They can't tell you much about where they are (unless they happen to be at one of the bomb sites, of course) but when they call out contacts or let you know that the hostages have been secured, you'll start to feel that you're playing against real people, not bots. The only thing that gives it away is the fact that they don't talk !@*& about my mom.  Forty bucks? I could see giving this a hearty (well, hearty-ish) recommendation at half that price but forty dollars is a bit steep for what you're getting here. Gamers who don't already own the frenetic Counter-Strike should be attracted to this new game as a good introduction that helps them transition into serious online competitors. Gamers who already accomplished Counter-Strike players will find the offline component somewhat novel but not indispensable. It certainly doesn't do enough to compete with today's shooters and the fact that much of the game is already available in another format makes this version seem a bit redundant.", "date": "Mar 24, 2004"}
