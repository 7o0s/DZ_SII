{"name": "Ed, Edd 'n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures", "name_review": "Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/12/01/ed-edd-n-eddy-the-mis-edventures-2", "text": "If you've seen the show on Cartoon Network, then you're probably familiar with Ed, Edd and Eddy. Basically, they're idiots obsessed with finding jawbreakers. In this respect, the game based on the show is no different. You'll spend your time controlling the trio in a hub world, called the Cul-de-Sac, from where you'll access the game's few levels. Each level is preceded by animation sequences that detail the limited story. For fans of the series or parents looking for a good game for their kids, this is a title to consider. It stays true to the squiggly-lined visual style of the show, has at times funny voice work, and maintains to some degree the scatterbrained sense of humor that made the show popular. However, do not buy it for the PC.   There's no real overarching plot to this game, it's basically just a series of episodic levels, called scams. There are six total scams, including two bonus levels which are unlocked if you're able to find hidden pieces of clothing. None of the levels are particularly challenging, but a lot of your objectives are, unfortunately, unclear to a confusing degree. Aside from those few moments that will have even veteran gamers scratching their heads, the game does have some decent gameplay elements a kid could really enjoy.   A prime example of something nobody should ever do. The game allows you to switch between Ed, Edd and Eddy on the fly, and they all have special abilities. Eddy, the leader, can throw stink bombs, sling his yo-yo, and form a tower consisting of him and his three teammates to reach high objects. Ed, the idiot tall one, can slam his head into the ground, dig in sandboxes, throw heavy objects, and form a battering ram with the other Eds. Edd, the smart one with the hat, can manipulate objects and switches in the environment, fire his slingshot, and get hoisted up by his teammates to reach higher ledges. As you progress through this extremely short game, you'll find that each level requires you to use each skill quite frequently.   The big problem with the PC version that wasn't present in the console version is with the controls. The game offers you three preset control configurations for your keyboard and one for a gamepad, none of which can be further tweaked. There are larger issues than this, however, mainly with the camera control. If you're using a keyboard to play you can use the mouse to swing the camera around but it moves too slowly to be functional. Still, this is better than when you're using a gamepad and have absolutely no camera control at all. Instead, you're at the mercy of viewing whatever your character happens to be running toward. This makes some of the timed puzzles nearly impossible since you'll need to look at things hidden from your direct field of vision. Creating even more of a problem is the fact that you'll pretty much need to use the gamepad if you want to aim Edd's slingshot. So basically, you're stuck between using the keyboard and being able to rotate the camera and using the gamepad so you can aim the slingshot. Considering how both of these options are necessary to beat the game, this is a huge problem.   Though the beginning levels give you a short of tutorial about where to use each skill, you'll quickly find yourself on your own. Afterwards, the challenge of the game is figuring out exactly which skill to use in which situation. So, in the haunted house level, it may take you a while to figure out how to get a can of grease to drop out of a picture frame. After what seems like a countless amount of time, you may eventually find that you needed to use Eddy's tower ability to grab an urn off a cabinet and put it on a shelf. Similarly, in one of the later levels you'll need to traverse a muddy bog. Using Edd's slingshot you'll knock down planks to help you get safely across. However, there will be one point where you'll continue to fall into the water, and you'll have to almost accidentally figure out that you needed to boost Edd up to a trailer roof and use his board to knock down a tire onto a tarp to help you get across.   This game just couldn't exist without Plank. Aside from these annoying points, the game has a decent amount of variety despite its brief length. You'll play sequences where you'll need to beat a timer, race opponents, or even stealth past town residents. These stealth sequences are suspiciously similar to Metal Gear Solid, requiring you to hide under boxes and putting question marks over the head of those you're trying to evade when they notice you. Nonetheless, it adds a nice variety to the gameplay, though not much depth.     Still, this is a children's game, and as such, it works pretty well. There are lots of collectibles to gather, including jawbreakers, chicken eggs that unlocks special game modes like Big Heads, and the costumes that unlock hidden levels. One of the hidden levels, Edzilla, was actually a lot of fun despite its simplicity. It gives you control of Ed as a fictional monster, and he needs to destroy all the buildings in a city while taking out tank manufacturing plants.   Graphically, the game captures the style of the TV show to an accurate degree with well animated, cel-shaded character models and cartoony backgrounds. Unfortunately there isn't a huge enemy variety, mostly rats, spiders, and squirrels. Too many of the environments look almost exactly the same, save for a few levels, and there is strange graphical flickering in some places. Also, you'll notice loading issues. There's no transition between indoor and outdoor environments. One second you're approaching a door, the next you're outside, which is disorienting for sure. The game unfortunately suffers from imprecise collision detection which strips away any strategy to the combat. To kill enemies, the best strategy is just to charge forward while slamming the attack button.   In addition to these graphical issues on the console version, the PC version has absolutely no graphical options. You can't even bump up the resolution of the title, which is inexcusable. So, if you really need to play this game on PC then you're going to be stuck with 640 by 480. Even though it's going to run at a slightly better clip than on consoles, it's still a sorry excuse for a PC port.   They're dumb. Though there's little to be heard, the sound is pretty good. Each level's music track is a subdued saxophone arrangement which fits with the shows main, whistling theme. The character voices can be hilarious at times, especially Ed's proclamation that he's just like a woodpecker, except with dirt, or his ~Dig a hole, dig a hole,~ expression when he's clawing sand. The problem is each character only has around two or three things they'll say as you go through levels. You're definitely going to get sick of Double D calling out, ~My, my, intriguing!~ every time he manipulates a mechanical device. Given how there's voice work throughout each cut scene, it would have been a welcome addition to include more of it in the regular gameplay.   In terms of characters, you'll find most of the regulars here, including the Kankers as your main opposition. You'll also run into Jimmy, Jonny and Plank, Rolf, and Sarah, who all also take part in the animated cut-scenes. They mostly function to give you quests within the game's levels. Unfortunately, many of these quests are annoying, especially the timed basketball tossing quest, which you might actually break your controller trying to complete. It wouldn't be an issue if the camera wasn't so slow to respond. Also, your character's walking speed takes a while to get to full bore, and under a timer this turns into a problem.For little kids or for big fans of the show this could be a solid buy, especially since the visuals reproduce the visual style of the show quite accurately. However, that's only true of the console version. On the PC, there are huge problems. The game is extremely short, the gameplay doesn't offer an impressive amount of depth, the puzzles can be overly confusing at times, and the character voices can get annoyingly repetitive. On top of that, the controls ruin the whole experience. Stay very far away from this one at all costs.", "date": "Dec 1, 2005"}
