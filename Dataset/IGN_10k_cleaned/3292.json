So too are discussions of tactics and strategy both in general and specific terms. My fondness for these two subjects is evident in the books I read, the classes I took in school and the games that I enjoy. Heck, this passion of mine is what got me my job at IGN in the first place.   But the lack of quality titles in the PC wargames market has meant that I've played more games like Warcraft than Operational Art of War since starting here. (An Operational Art of Warcraft might go a long way to giving us the best of both worlds.) Consequently, on the rare occasions when I do get a wargame, I expect a lot out of it. For one thing, it has to go beyond the basic advantages of the early PC wargames. Originally PC wargames simply supplied resolved rules, handled board and piece setup and provided an opponent who didn't eat all your pizza.   In terms of branding, companies like TalonSoft were the big suppliers of high-visibility -- and generally high-quality -- wargames in years past. But the recent shift in focus we've seen in Take-Two's catalog means that there's more room for publishers like Shrapnel and Matrix to release good titles that can start to grab more attention. It would help if they actually sold these titles in stores, but that's another issue. In any case Matrix's latest release, Uncommon Valor: Campaign for the South Pacific, certainly deserves our interest and rewards our involvement.   Hopefully a game like Uncommon Valor: Campaign for the South Pacific will get the kind of attention it deserves and the kind that good titles in this genre often miss among more RTS/FPS/RPG-minded gamers. So what makes this game so great? Well, the basics are here -- convenience, a smart opponent, a reliable rules system and an intriguing context. Anyone who knows designer Gary Grigsby's previous game Pacific War won't be surprised at the depth of the game, but they will find the open scalability and clean interface a nice change of pace.   The game puts you in charge of either the Japanese or Allied forces in the South Pacific from the middle of 1942 through the end of 43. Stretching from Truk in the north to Brisbane in the south, and from New Guinea in the west to the New Hebrides in the east, Uncommon Valor provides a large but comprehensible arena for your battles. The beautiful map makes playing the game easy on the eyes (unless you turn on the horribly obnoxious hex borders). Hexes themselves are 30 miles on a side and the game turns can represent anywhere from one to seven days.   You'll be commanding things on an operational level and there are almost too many tasks to consider. You'll be in charge of creating and utilizing naval task forces, ordering bombing missions, rotating your pilots in and out of service, constructing bases, transferring supplies, watching for enemy subs, sending ground forces to attack enemy installations and towns, laying and sweeping for mines, and just about anything else that might fall under the umbrella of operational command.   All these efforts should proceed with two related goals in mind: first, to meet and defeat the enemy's forces, and second, to capture territory for yourself. Of course, each scenario comes with its own more specific victory conditions but you're given a surprising amount of latitude to select how best to achieve victory. And since the enemy AI is supply-minded and capable of indirect attacks and maneuvers, you'll need to focus if you want to win.   Winning requires the skillful interaction of so many elements that it would be impossible (and probably boring) to catalog them all here. Let's just take a single example. As part of your offense, you'll need to send bombers over to attack enemy positions and targets. You select an airfield and see all the units stationed there. Once a squadron is selected you'll see the number of planes and pilots that are ready for action. You'll need to keep the pilots and planes in rotation so that both can maintain a high state of readiness. The pilots are rated for morale and experience and the squadron leader is rated in leadership and inspiration. The bombers need to be given a target and mission before being sent off and you can even set their specific altitude if you want to come in lower or higher than usual. Naturally all of these statistics and decisions affect the success rate of the mission.   Now imagine a system that involved (sometimes more so) for each aspect of the game -- sending up CAP, shadowing enemy transports, building airfields and bases on islands, transferring supplies, task force patrol, keeping headquarters and logistics departments where they're needed. I could go on and on. In fact, the game itself can start to drag on and on as a result of all these decisions. (It's only really a problem while waiting for the enemy to complete his turn.)   This depth is carried through to other areas as well. Weather can change suddenly and ground a whole day's worth of flights. When your forces do engage the enemy, a sidebar opens to show the combatants arrayed against one another. Some small animations reflect the damage done to one side or the other. This is particularly true of ships. Smoke and flames display varying degrees of damage. (In fact, individual components can be damaged on a particular ship so you might take out the rear turret or penetrate the deck armor with a given attack.)    When the plane fights end, you'll see a listing of all the pilots who scored kills. There's a promotion system as well and, while you'd think you wouldn't get to know a particular pilot given all the other stuff you have to consider in the game, trust me; as soon as you get a message informing you that Dan Adams, the new Guinea ace with seven kills, has been shot down, you'll actually feel a connection.   There are numerous other little touches as well. When recon planes go out for a mission, you can hear the click and whir of cameras. It might not sound like much, but in this day of overproduced and oversaturated effects, it's nice to find a few that make their point without screaming at you.   Sadly, much of the detail of the actual mechanics of the game is impenetrable without quick and convenient access to the manual. While it may seem a small thing, this is a strike against Uncommon Valor. There is a very comprehensive electronic manual in PDF form but the sometimes-fishy nature of the ALT-TAB support makes it a hassle to refer to it during the game. Why this manual isn't included within the game shell is a mystery. Even worse, the tutorial that ships with the game requires you to follow along in the manual if you're to make any sense of it at all. While you can get by printing out a dozen or so pages from the lengthy manual, it's still an unfortunate inconvenience.   The game ships with several scenarios, each representing a particular aspect of the war. You can pick a quick 10-turn game if you like or hunker down for the ambitious 20-month grand campaign. There's a really good sense of relationship between the missions (same story, same map) but there's no progression from one mission to the next. Finish one and pick a new one essentially. And since there's a fair bit of overlap between the missions (one runs from August to December, another runs from August to October of the same year, for instance), you'll won't be as compelled to play through all of them.   What is unfortunate is the lack of a true progressive campaign that incorporates the entire effort in a single setting. There are two scenarios that run from start to finish but with a system like this, I really regretted the absence of Pearl Harbor or Midway. Of course, the amazing depth of the game might be harder to achieve if the scope was widened too much.   This failure to include Midway in any of the campaigns also leads, particularly in the long scenarios, to one of the game's great joys -- namely that the Japanese can actually win the war. I haven't made it work quite yet, but the potential is definitely there. The Japanese also benefit from an endless fuel reserve at Truk. This is meant, I suppose, merely to reflect Truk's nature as conduit of supplies from Japan itself. In any case, it evens the playing field just enough to keep the ultimate resolution up in the air for some time.   I have a few final quibbles with the game. The main among the minor ones is the over-abstraction of ground combat. To be fair, it's not the focus of the game, but of necessity the ground combat in Uncommon Valor is relatively shallow, especially when stacked against the incredible detail and meticulousness in nearly every other area of the game. Things like fatigue and disruption are handled, just not as visibly as other facets of the game.    What did you think of Uncommon Valor?   Another big inconvenience is Uncommon Valor's reliance on so many spreadsheets. It might work fine for accountants, drug dealers and marketing types who are used to such things, but you'll get the hang of it soon. What you will never get used to is the lack of mouse wheel support for the game's many scrollable lists. Additionally, some of the interface designs, while a big step forward from Pacific War, are slightly sticky and unintuitive.While Uncommon Valor isn't for the inattentive gamer, it's got more potential for popular appeal than most wargames. The broad-reach of the game doesn't come at the expense of detail or flexibility though, so it shouldn't put off the hardcore crowd either. If it sounds like the best of both worlds, it truly is -- a operational game with an individual slant that offers enough detail to keep the OOB enthusiasts interested yet still be simple enough to let newer players get their feet wet.Beyond this big picture approach, I also found lots of joy in the tiny details that the game seems to throw at you from time to time. You have to pay attention to quite a few of them, but so many more extra details have been put in and, the more you want to pay attention to them, the more you can get involved in the game. I won't say it's completely scalable because you'll always need to pay attention to lots of data -- Uncommon Valor just makes it much more convenient and rewarding for those who are willing to make the leap from more traditional turn-based strategy games.", "date": "Dec 2, 2002"}
