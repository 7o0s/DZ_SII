It's a collection of free-wheeling mini-games, glued together by silly takes n the primary process. Players pick their fave candidate from a group of six contenders -- including John Edwards, Barack Obama, Rudy Giuliani, and Mitt Romney -- and then take out across this great nation to score votes by completing goofy contests. It's a lighthearted little game that will likely be forgotten by the time November 7 actually rolls around, but sometimes a trifle is exactly the proper prescription for these heavy times.   The candidates are presented as caricatures of themselves, from Obama's wide smile to Romney's and Edwards' ultra-groomed images. Hillary Clinton is also included, complete with a frozen hairdo and some very tired wrinkles. Nobody looks grotesque in Battle for the White House, which helps offend nobody, although there is certainly no shortage of image and personality quirks that the game could have skewered. I do wish John McCain or Mike Huckabee weren't absent from the game, as they have become far bigger players than Giuliani and Thompson. (Heck, Thompson is already out of the race.)   There are two campaigns in this Battle. The main campaign takes you through primary season, splitting the country into five sections. You must win votes by beating the mini-games in each region. If you hit the needed vote count (which always goes up), you qualify to box one of your competitors. After winning the bout, you move on to the next region in hopes of eventually capturing the White House. The second campaign is a free play mode where you can practice events.   According to Gameloft, there are over seventy little challenges in here. Admittedly, I have not seen all of the events, but while criss-crossing the country in my campaign, I got to play games like these: Collect votes in a maze like Pac-Man, roll a giant ball of votes through a course, dance at a debate, fly through the air by setting a launch angle and power boost (like Johnny Crash), and bat away protestors from a waiting limo. The controls for these mini-games are exceedingly simple, so you get the hang of the game within just a few seconds. It's not entirely unlike a WarioWare game, but strangle enough, this novelty title is actually deeper than Gameloft previous attempt at the micro-game craze, Cancun Gone Wild.   The boxing matches are much simpler than Glu's primary season game, White House Rumble. You use 7 and 9 to land blows and then stick to 2 and 8 to block shots. If you hit your opponent enough, you earn a power punch (attached to 0) that cleaves a hefty portion of their health bar.   Battle for the White House looks -- as you might expect for a Gameloft game -- great. The candidates are finely detailed, the backdrops bright and colorful, and the general presentation is generally cheery. The map screen is particularly cool to look at, with its regional features. The music is not necessarily standout, but it's nothing that had me reaching for the mute button.  Battle for the White House is a fun little game and for somebody that takes politics personally, it was a cute way to vent a bit. The game is not mean-spirited in the least. The mini-games are generally entertaining, with a few standouts, such as the vote rolling. If you have even a passing interest in the primary season, Battle for the White House is a good little download. You'll get some cheer from it, and these days, some of us could use all the cheer we can get.", "date": "Jan 25, 2008"}
