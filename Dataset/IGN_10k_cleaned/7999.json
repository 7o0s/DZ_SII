A lot has changed over the years.  Although modern  flight sims still do come with thick instruction booklets, today's sims also  have acknowledged the casual gamer's interest in flying planes and  helicopters without a degree in rocket science.    Apache Havoc, the first flight simulation from Razorworks, will require both  a degree in rocket science and a good chunk of reading time before taking  flight.  Rather than allowing novices (and even veterans) the opportunity to  learn the intricate, keyboard heavy control mechanics through an in-game  tutorial, there's a thick User Guide to explain the controls in black and  white.  Perhaps it's because the developers, based in Oxford, England, enjoy  a good read.  But I can think of far better reading than technical writing.   A tutorial would have gone a long way with this game.  Flight sim enthusiasts can read on to learn more about this combat helicopter  simulation, but the rest of you should forget about this title.  I can  understand bypassing a tutorial if the Joystick option voided the keyboard,  but there are over 200 keys required to play this game.  Good luck figuring  that out on your own.  If you are looking for plug and play ease, look  elsewhere.    Apache Havoc is actually two flight simulators on one disc.  The game brings  two of the most-feared modern day combat helicopters to your fingertips: the  U.S. Army's AH-64D Apache Longbow and the Russian MiL-28N Havoc-B.  Both have  been meticulously recreated with beautiful 3-D graphics.  You can view these  choppers and the surrounding area from 30 unique camera angles.  Several of  the TV style camera angles show the working gun turrets and the rotors even  flop, depending on your air speed. Even the windshield wipers work, which  comes in handy with the variable rain, snow and weather conditions that  effect your flying.  While the developers took their time crafting every last detail of the  choppers and the arsenal of 50 U.S. and Russian air, sea and ground vehicles,  they cut some corners with the 3-D terrain that makes up so much of the game.   The 3-D accelerated graphics have a virtual, hand-drawn feel, rather than  the photorealistic look of many of today's combat flight sims.  Adding to  that, the trees and other surroundings have some serious pop-up (I played the  game on a Pentium 333 with a Rage 3-D accelerator card). Buildings are  basically 3-D blocks with windows.  They can be destroyed, crumbling slowly  as you fire upon them, but there's not much detail in the architecture.   They're still fun to blow up and certainly serve their purpose.  The hills  and valleys are rather plain.  And the foliage is poorly drawn. The jungle  edges are like a green wall that simply ends.  Since this is a low-altitude  game that encourages (and requires) you to fly low and hide behind buildings,  mountains and trees, the poor graphics are all the more noticeable. They just  seem antiquated.   Apache Havoc offers three basic modes of play: Free Flight, Campaign and  Multiplayer.  Free Flight, which allows you to take off and fly around in  either chopper, is a must for the beginners who have read the instruction  manual.  You get a good feel for both aircraft in this mode and also begin to  learn the intricate keyboard system.  This mode allows you to blow up your  own base, and anything else, without having to worry about the consequences.  One thing that the developers did throw in to help you out (besides the  Novice option) is the option to allow a computer-controlled Copilot/Gunner to  aid you on your missions.   Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to understand what he says, or anyone  else, for that matter.  The radio chatter is so garbled that you cannot  decipher it.  And with no subtitle option, you're literally left out to dry  in the middle of combat.  On the plus side, the ambient sound effects and  background music are average.  In addition to the Free Flight, there are a number of dynamic single and  multiplayer campaigns set in current hot spots around the globe. The Cuban  Crisis pits the U.S. against Fidel Castro's heirs in a battle for Guantanamo  Bay.  The Opium War is set in the Asian Golden Triangle, where Myanmar, Laos  and Thailand come together.  This campaign involves the biggest drug bust of  all time, orchestrated by China on Thailand-without a search warrant.   Caspian Black Gold is set in the Republic of Georgia, pitting the U.S.  against a hyper-nationalistic Russian government.  Each of these dynamic  campaigns gives the player a variety of missions and a different campaign  each time, which makes for great replay value.  As you accomplish each  mission, your tour of duty is extended and the campaign continues.  The multiplayer option supports serial, modem, LAN, or Internet play (on  Heat.net and mplayer.com).  I had no problems flying either helicopter via  the internet connections.  These campaigns are the same as single-player, but  with human counterparts and foes, which always makes replay higher. The fact  that this game requires you to hover above a forest road, hiding behind the  trees, out of enemy line of sight, adds a whole new dimension to combat.   Just blazing guns and missiles won't guarantee success here, you will have to  run and hide. Startegically offensive-minded players can use sunken rivers  with raised banks for ambush opportunities.    This game requires a lot of patience and knowledge (i.e. read the instruction  manual), but the end result is a just reward.  Although there are graphical  flaws, on the whole, this game creates a living, breathing virtual  battlefield.  From the snow and rain conditions to the dusk and night flying,  this game offers a myriad of mission variables. The 3-D environments, which  aren't perfect, do create cities that look like cities.  Airbases have palm  trees, vehicles and men running here and there.  During combat, you get the  sense of a dynamic campaign by watching Su-33s, F-16s, F/A-18s and Su-25s  doing their own thing overhead, while various armor units mix it up on the  ground.  All missions are full of AI activity, which adds to the realism and  fun factors  -- John Gaudiosi", "date": "May 4, 1999"}
