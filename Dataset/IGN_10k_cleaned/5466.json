Tekken's Nina Williams quite thoroughly fulfills each of these obligatory requirements.   First, she must have been constructed with no sense of proportional symmetry. Nina's breasts create gravitational fields of their own, her behind is roughly the size of her back, her stomach could double as a Twizzler, and her legs outstretch a giraffe's... Go ahead and scratch off check box number one because she has abnormal sex appeal covered.   Second, all digital heroines must have the pointed faces of supermodels and the determined squints of jet fighter pilots. Nina's eyes pierce steel and her face sells Revlon, so she certainly meets criteria number two.   Third, all female leads aspiring to attain videogame stardom should allow themselves to be dressed as promiscuous streetwalkers with untreated anime addictions. At one point in Namco's Death by Degrees, Nina walks into a giant closet of clothing and picks out (of all things) a tight vinyl suit with a fishnet front and some kicking high heels. Damn, baby!   Finally, all hard-hitting hotties must possess supernatural ninja-wrestling powers that totally contradict their easy-breezy manner. Our disproportionate, soft, stern, harlot-dressed ultra-heroine can shatter a man's skull with just a light punch, so hell yeah to that one.   Given her effortless achievements in the field of videogame vixen-ing, Nina should theoretically make the perfect heroine for the perfect action game. She certainly meets all the qualifications, anyway. There's just one problem with being queen of the digital ball: it's a terribly generic sash that you have to wear.   Unsurprisingly, Nina's adventures as Miss Super Ninja Assassin with Enormous Breasts 2005 are just as unoriginal and tactless as she is. This means that even without the intent focus on Tekken's scantily clad fighting femme -- a character that rabid T fans aren't nearly as excited about compared to others -- the game would still be a ridiculous collection of poorly thought-out combat sequences, awful boss encounters, sloppy levels, and a seemingly endless supply of tedium.   Nina and Smithee, Kicking It To clarify, all you have to do is take one terrorist organization that doubles as a multinational corporation, one cruise ship that's ~laid out like a labyrinth,~ one hot polygonal lady, one underground fighting tournament, and one disastrous kind of gameplay. Mix in one part cheesy dialog and three parts excessive loading. Refrigerate and then serve. Who wants some Death by Degrees?   The clever title implies that damage dealing will be accomplished by precisely manipulating the right analog stick in a circular fashion. But, it's more accurately an epitaph for our poor Dual Shock. It's not that this particular setup is truly new and thus originally terrible (never forget Rise to Honor and Monster Hunter). It's that, unlike those games, Death by Degrees focuses even more on inane analog tapping at high rates of speed. This causes problems that other previous analog action attempts didn't.   All this uncomfortable thumb swiveling and panning, despite the immediate sensation that everything could have been duplicated on the face buttons and duplicated better, is a real pain in the butt. In trying to deliver a more engrossing, accessible multi-opponent fighting system, Namco managed to strip away all the depth associated with the genre while adding an unwanted layer of imprecise frustration.   Imagine being accosted by a multitude of belligerent enemies (some exceedingly powerful). You might have just initiated an attack on one opponent when another begins his assault. Instead of dismissing your first to counter the second, you're caught in an ongoing combo animation routine that was the result of the analog sticks' clunky back and forth nature. Should you be able to limit your attacks to prevent being looped into combos that weren't supposed to initiate, you'll still be hard-pressed to stick the pad in the opposite direction precisely enough to block the incoming attack. The player's only recourse is then to dodge, which works even less often than blocking, since that involves flicking the left analog stick instead of the right and flicking it in exactly the right way. Had Namco not elected to layer controls atop one another, much of this burdensome combat could have been a lot better.    First, there is no good reason why the attack and block functions should be bound to the same analog stick (attacks duplicate parries if pulled off in opportune moments). There is also no good reason why dodge should be bound to the same stick as walk, only activated by a faster pull and release motion. Simply removing these functions and more appropriately binding them to the shoulder or face buttons (which are reserved for nothing, menus, or complimentary attacks) could have seriously improved a combat system that currently doesn't work well. Of course, the collision detection and camera system would still need a fair bit of work to make anything resembling action at all redeemable.   It's not that Death by Degrees is terribly hard, save for a few choice moments, it's that it just doesn't feel any good, at all. The action is even more pointless than the most obtuse button masher, and happens to also be far less frantic. Since getting hit is pretty much a requirement, the game forces its players to stop the combat quite often, navigate a slow and unresponsive menu, and eat a whole bunch of health bars. Because of all this, the new fighting gimmicks only manage to worsen a game that already suffers in quite a few other areas.   But blondes are supposed to have all of the fun, aren't they? Sure, but that's only if you equate ~fun~ to aimlessly wandering about drab locales looking for shiny things to pick up, and medallions to place into statutes that were explicitly created to hold medallions. You guessed it, the gameplay formula, and non-combat control scheme of DBD is a rip-off of the first Resident Evil!   Why does my super assassin drive like a Plymouth? Why is it whenever she inspects or picks up an object, the game skids to a halt to pop up a few text prompts? Why does climbing ladders feel like inching across the Sahara? Nina is an elite assassin, but she apparently can't do anything very quickly. Even if it is decades old, this kind of clunky third-person navigation and exploration just barely works for the more deliberately-paced survival horror titles -- but it's simply inappropriate in a game about a killer and her unrivaled abilities.   And between it all comes an utterly astonishing amount of loading. Sometimes it actually feels like Death by Degrees' gameplay merely serves as a staging point to usher in the next wave of loading. Go down an elevator and it'll load a level. Take one step and it'll load a ten second cutscene that will quickly end and load back into the level. Open a door five seconds later and it will load into another ten second cutscene followed by another cutscene exiting load. Walk about five meters, examine something, and watch in amazement as the game loads one more five-second cutscene followed by one last cutscene conclusion load. Help!   Of course, no absurd string of loading and Resident Evil-flavored meandering would be complete without a lot of arbitrary item use. First, let's try and open every door in the hopes that ours is the key that works. Afterward we'll revisit the piano and its neighboring statues to see if the coin we just found fits someplace. Later, we'll continually attempt to open that one, ~Come here at some random point in time after this~ place.   Death by Degrees is riddled with poor design decisions like those. They even extend to some very basic areas. For instance, instead of hitting the player with a ~The lock has been deactivated~ prompt every time a door is opened, just open the door. And why is it when Nina discards an item it vanishes into the void that separates our universe from countless others? If she drops something on the floor, shouldn't she be able to pick it up again? Also, it'd be swell if when she did eventually die, she didn't just reappear at the last save, which could have been upwards of 45 minutes ago. Some sort of pre-boss, pre-giant fight checkpoint system would have really been helpful. Given Namco's consistently amazing production values, I honestly can't begin to explain Death by Degrees.   To its credit, the solid looking, decently performing Death by Degrees does offer some clever pictorial driven puzzles, a few gripping combat maneuvers, and a sometimes-sweet x-ray zoom damage system. Of course, the connection to create a bone breaking x-ray doesn't always work and the satisfaction that comes from exploding a skull lasts as long as the animation does, since in-game models show none of the side effects of such hits.I'm honestly at a loss to deliver a genuine positive without it being closely followed by a very serious negative. Death by Degrees is nothing else but a disappointment. It's a game that wrongs its user over and over again so that after only a few short hours, the novelty of analog combat wears extremely thin. It wears so thin, in fact, that the already-dated exploratory mechanics can't do anything to save it.Even stalwart Tekken fans will need to flex extra hard to squeeze some fun out of this one.", "date": "Feb 3, 2005"}
