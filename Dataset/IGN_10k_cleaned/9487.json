Do publishers see these games and say, ~Well, it certainly looks like crap, but maybe the kids will like it?~ Who knows. Luckily, you've got us here to make sure you don't waste your hard-earned money on weak games.  Space Griffon takes place on a lunar station. Other than that, it's just like Doom, except it's not fun. Sure, the station looks OK, but it's so excrutiatingly slow as to make it almost unplayable. And just when you thought it couldn't get any slower, it literally stops so you can receive inane messages from your other mech-suited comrades. There's no need for this - other games have successfully integrated on screen messages with no slow-down problems.  Plot is always helpful when it comes to first-person shooters, but so is action. No action = no fun. Space Griffon suffers horribly from this equation, so don't bother.", "date": "Nov 27, 1996"}
