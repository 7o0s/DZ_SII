{"name": "Summoner", "name_review": "Summoner", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/25/summoner", "text": "Created by Volition, the talented developers that have received critical praise for its work on titles like Descent for the PC platform, THQ's Summoner is one of the most highly anticipated and most-hyped titles that are available for PlayStation 2 from the get go. It has received much of this attention because of a variety of reasons including its part in the anti-aliasing craziness, the respect that people in the industry have for the game's developers and for the simple fact that it's one of the few completely original titles coming out in the early lifespan of Sony's new-fangled 128-bit gaming system.   Gameplay  If you're expecting a typical console RPG with Summoner, you'll be in for a major shock because it's far from it. First of all, the game is much more text heavy than most console RPGs, as both significant and insignificant non-player characters will commonly have several full boxes worth of text to say at any given point during the game. In fact, when conversing with many of the key characters during vital segments of the game, players will be required to read through upwards of 100 words of text to get the full scope of what's going on. Luckily, most of the game's text is extremely well written and never really becomes a chore to read.   All the text has a reason, as the game has a very deep and involving storyline that is a bit less linear and more encompassing than what players are presented with in most ordinary console RPGs.  Filled with plenty of outlandish plot twists and turns, the story begins with the introduction of Joseph, a young man who had vowed to never use his Summoning powers ever again as a demon that he had summoned to protect his village from enemy attackers slaughtered his own village and killed all that he loved. And while Joseph may be considered the game's central character, three others are introduced that play substantial roles in the progression of the game's plotline.   What's more, each of the characters are fully playable when they're in the party and because of the way that the game's experience point system has been formulated, it pays to switch back and forth between the characters that you're controlling to make sure that each are leveled up properly. Herein lies another one of the game's strong points as leveling up your characters is much more involving than simply killing monsters to gain experience points as the player is given control over what skills of each player is beefed up as they get to choose where to distribute the points that have been earned. And given that only certain characters will have the ability to use some weapon types or perform special abilities, such as Flece's lock picking, it's essential to increase the skills intelligently.   The game's immense depth can also be seen in its battle system that is seemingly patterned after Square's Vagrant Story for PlayStation. It is a mixture of real-time and turn-based combat that makes use of Chain Attacks that are performed by properly timing the press of a direction on the digital pad as the character's weapon is striking the opponent (which is symbolized by a chain appearing above the head of the onscreen character). And just as the case was with Vagrant Story, many other factors are taken into account when battling an enemy creature including the type of weapon and its magical affinity compared to the strengths and weaknesses of the creature against the category of weapon. Many other factors will also come into play during battles including the speed of the weapon, which affects the ease of chaining attacks, and the positioning of your character in relation to the enemy -- as things like having the higher ground will give you advantages in melees.   The combat can be spiced up a bit more when Joseph regains the ability to start summoning creatures. These summoned beasts are very powerful allies and can become one of the five possible characters that you can take control over during that game. The only thing you have to worry about when you have a summoned beast out is that if Joseph gets knocked unconscious, it might turn on your remaining party members -- so don't let that happen.   In terms of playability, the raw size and depth of the game can be too much for its own good at times. First of all, the towns are massive and are filled with more townsfolk to talk to than you'll typically find in a console RPG. Because of this, it's very easy to get completely lost in the game and not really know where to head next. Luckily, there are plenty of side quests that you can go on that help kill some time as you try and figure out where to go and what to do next in the game's main plotline.   Another thing worth mentioning is that the game suffers from some painfully long load times when going into cities, moving on into new areas in cities and popping into random encounters on the world map. The loads can occasionally last for longer than 10 seconds and really interferes with the smooth progression of the game.   Graphics  The visuals in Summoner has been a hot topic of discussion in the online world thanks to the entire anti-aliasing extravaganza that has pretty much taken over the minds of videogame journalists and system fan boys ever since PlayStation 2 was released on March 4, 2000 in Japan with a very jagged-looking Ridge Racer V from Namco. Volition was the first company to come out and say that it had solved the anti-aliasing problem and actually had full-scene anti-aliasing implemented in Summoner. While the debate still rages on as to whether or Summoner is using real FSAA or just some sort of a special filtering method (I personally don't care either way), the end result is a very smooth looking game that is running in high-resolution at 30 frames per second with very little jaggies or interlace flicker to speak of.    And for the most part, the game looks fairly impressive and should definitely be considered one of the better looking games on the new system. The general texture quality of the characters and the game's 3D environments is reasonably good and the environments by and large have a very color, vibrant and organic look to them that help bring them to life. However, on the other side of the coin, the characters all have a very blocky appearance with lots of sharp edges and the game is plagued with a horrendous draw distance. While not as bad as games like G-Police on PlayStation or Daytona USA on Sega Saturn, the pop-up in Summoner is pretty damn appalling nevertheless. Large buildings, enemy creatures and random townsfolk will occasionally just pop-up a few feet in front of your party members as if they've just been beamed down from the Enterprise.   In addition to the bad draw in, there are also some occasional clipping problems with characters and text bubbles going through walls and there are times where it appears that the framerate will drop below 30 frames per second even though the game has been supposedly locked at 30. Still, Summoner isn't a bad looking game and good things outweigh the bad.   Sound  Summoner has an excellent musical score that really shines during some of its more intense in game cinematic cut scenes. The music not only typically fits the setting of the game perfectly, but it also manages to help create the atmosphere in situations where it's really needed. While some of the general town music can be uninspiring, the music during key storytelling moments during the game is almost always perfect.   Also on the plus side, the game makes use of an ample amount of character speech during its various cut scenes that it uses to further along the game's storyline. Moreover, the voiceovers are very convincing as they are not only acted out quite well, but the dialog has been cleverly and intelligently written.   The only complaint that I have with the game's audio is that the sound effects during battles are somewhat wimpy and don't quite give off the feeling of impact that they should. While there are chimes for when you properly time a chain attack, the lack of really powerful sounds for the contact of swords and other weapons hitting your opponent can make the player feel distant from the battles.  My expectations and opinions with regard to Summoner have changed over the course of the past five or six months more times than I can count on a single hand. It began as a game that I was very interested in playing, quickly changed to something I had no interest in at all (crappy version on display at E3 was the cause of this), back to something I wanted to play and so on. Just about every time my anticipation for the game would peak, it would be quickly reversed by some new revelation that made me completely uninterested in the product. In fact, coming into this review, Summoner was the one launch game that was on my list of games to review that I was not looking forward to playing through. To cut a long story short, after playing a little over 30 hours of the final product, I have come to the conclusion that Summoner is a very enthralling role-playing game experience that is without a doubt the best of the RPGs that are available at launch. It isn't the be all and end all of RPGs and hasn't really lived up to all of the hype that it has been receiving from this Website and others, but it's a very good game. While it does have flaws (they're all mentioned in the text of the review above), the game has a compelling storyline, plenty of intriguing plot developments, and an insanely deep combat system. Plus, it offers gamers a very long adventure that will likely take well over 30 hours to complete just the main quests and probably more than double that when you factor in all of the option mini-quests. While a bit short of greatness, Summoner is an admirable role-playing game experience that is more than one could have ever really hoped for in an RPG that's available at a new system's launch.", "date": "Oct 25, 2000"}
