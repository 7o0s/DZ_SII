And if we can't get an entirely new game every few months, at least there are a number of developers out there continuing to bring new experiences to the core games. Today we're looking at a Canadian title that brings a European flavor to the IL-2 Forgotten Battles. Called Combat Over Europe, the new add-on includes loads of new missions and some interesting side features to the series.  Since this is fairly straightforward mission pack with a small number of additional features, we're going to refer you to the original Forgotten Battles review. There you can read about the great graphics, the highly accurate flight modeling and all the other features that we thought made Forgotten Battles such a great flight sim. In evaluating Combat Over Europe then, our main focus in on how the new missions enhance and expand on the core game and how the whole experience is presented.   In short what Combat Over Europe offers is a slew of new campaigns, from four new Luftwaffe campaigns -- two for the Bf-109 and one each for the Stuka and Me262 -- to four new Allied campaigns -- two for the Americans and two for the Russians. There's a damn lot of missions here and, though there's a great variety of them, there's still a bit of repetition to be found. It can make slow going for players who want to enlist at the lowest levels at the start of each campaign.  In terms of presentation, Combat Over Europe is what we reviewers call a ~mixed bag.~ Half of the additions are both meaningful and instantly engaging. The other half seem either to have been thrown together with little regard for the consistency or enjoyment of the overall experience. The Battle of Britain ~campaign~ belongs to this latter category. Not only is the campaign only playable as a series of unconnected, individual  missions, many of the missions still take place on the maps from the core game. While I dig taking to the skies against the dreaded Hun in the cockpit of my trusty Hurricane, doing so over Smolensk hardly makes the experience seem authentic.  Though there's a huge number and wide variety to the missions, there are some definite slow points. Escorting transports across the English Channel may be interesting from a historical standpoint, but it's relatively low on action, at least for the P-47 pilots flying escort. Unlike the recent Pacific Fighters there's no time skip function to get you to what action that is there in a hurry. Some missions also seem to suffer from odd scripting problems. I've had several cases where the game tells me I've completed the primary objectives before I've taken off from the runway.   The speech pack that converts the previous game's Russian and German radio chatter is a nice addition. Sure, it takes away some of the authenticity of the setting, but it goes a long way towards making things much more comprehensible when you're in the middle of a dogfight.  There's a passel of PDF files on the CD that cover a wide range of interesting topics. The articles on the Me262 and the primer on Air Combat Tactics are probably the best of the bunch. The appeal of some of the other PDFs depends on your own interests. The cockpit details and the two essays on the P-47 and P-51 were particularly interesting for me. For only twenty bucks this add-on is definitely worth it for the hardcore crowd. Since the IL-2 community offers a lot of mission support for free, gamers who are only looking for a little extra content can easily get it without buying Combat Over Europe. The extra documents are a nice treat for the historically-minded players.", "date": "Nov 11, 2004"}
