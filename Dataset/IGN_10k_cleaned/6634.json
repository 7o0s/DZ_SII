Of course, that can only mean one thing, Drakengard 2. With this latest entry, loads of work has been put in to improve the title, but without many enhancements to the mechanics. The result is like watching an athlete on a treadmill. He may be sweating like crazy and moving his feet furiously on a spinning flap of rubber, but he hasn't gone anywhere.    With so many tweaks and additions, Drakengard 2 is a wild success on paper. There are the multiple characters to play with, plenty of accessories to equip, more enemies to fight, etc. But despite all of this, far too much of the game still involves hacking through mindless hordes of fodder. Absentmindedly tapping on the square button repeatedly is a justifiable tactic that will serve players well through most of the game. Go through enough of this and one feels like Drakengard 2 is largely made up of simple button mashing between the boss battles -- and that's because that's just what it is.    The sheer escapism of slicing up knights by the dozen might be fine for a budget title, but with Drakengard 2 this approach is all the more disappointing because it could have been so much more. The storyline admirably continues the bizarre and fantastically medieval world that was established in the original game. A full 18 years have passed from the first title and the main character, Nowe, was raised by a dragon and has become a Knight of the Seal to help protect the land. This is all well and good until a woman walks into his life and turns everything upside down.    As Nowe progresses through the story we find that many things are not as they seem. The Knights of the Seal are actually the oppressors of the land and in the ultimate act of teenage rebellion, Nowe joins the effort to bring them down. This means fighting plenty of knights as well as some other beasties in the name of justice. Along the way, others join Nowe's party too and these characters can be swapped inside the battle. The three other playable characters each have their own class of weapon and by simply selecting their weapon from the menu (just like Caim did in the original) these characters switch places. This is very useful for picking the proper character for a certain enemy, such as the woman Manah for magic users, or even solving the occasional character-specific puzzle.    With these characters constantly available it would be appropriate if the gameplay required fairly regular changes to adjust to the situation, but more often than not the character with the best weapon is the default. And again this can mostly be done with button-mashing. There is a magic system with each weapon assigned its own specific spell, but instead of being a vital tool it's really more of a way of speeding up the inevitable. Want to knock down the group of guys in front of you in five seconds instead of ten? Go ahead and blast 'em with a bit of the special powers.    The inspiration for the ground fighting is clearly from the Dynasty Warriors franchise, but there's a lack of urgency in the battles themselves. Instead of frantically running about to take care of a large battle and having to be mindful of different strategies, Drakengard 2 continues with just dumping in more boring enemies to wade through. Too many challenges involve going from point A to door B, but not before killing a few dozen barely-mobile soldiers along the way. And if there's no requirement of killing everyone first you can just run right by them.   To help out with big crowds in the open areas, Nowe can call upon his foster dragon parent, Legna, for help. After a quick tap on the Select button, Nowe jumps up onto his back to fly around the levels. With powerful fireballs, Legna can quickly roast the basic fighters, leaving the magicians and special knights to be cleaned up by the ground crew. It's so easy that it goes right into being too easy. Simply hovering in place and lobbing fireballs in every direction will clean up most of the trouble. Instead of being a fun blaster this quickly turns into a bit of a chore -- as yet again it's easy to kill the fodder.    The other use for Legna is in the Panzer Dragoon-ish air battles where other flying creatures or aircraft must be fought. This works to mix up the action a bit, as well as being eye candy, since Legna is able to target multiple enemies and then send out a volley of mini-fireballs towards them. But the same problems as the ground battles happen here since many of the enemies just aren't that difficult to take down. Many of them are sitting ducks that may fire off cannons or other attacks, but are otherwise a snap to destroy. It doesn't help that many of the air battles feel exactly the same and sometimes are a carbon copy of a previous fight. Taking down a huge airship is a thrill the first time, but more of a nuisance the fourth time.    Back on the ground, the battles take place in environments that are more interesting than the first game, but marginally so. It must be more difficult than previously imagined to design a grassy valley since each gets used more than once. The interior spaces may have more variety, but only because big rooms are easier to create. The best bit of comedy comes when the party gets to a city and Nowe is warned of getting lost in the streets because the metropolis is so massive. A quick check to the map shows that people must've thought Nowe to be an utter moron if they're afraid of him getting confused with just two open plazas and a couple of alleys off the side. Then again, one of those plazas did have a fountain. Pretty tricky!    Beyond the hundreds and thousands of knights who are eager to get killed (with only a few trying to strike back) it's a godsend to come across the small number of characters that are a little trickier. These are the larger knights with gigantic swords, magicians, minotaurs, and other beasties. Going up against one of them isn't so bad since it's easy to just avoid or block the attacks and then counter, but it's the group battles where the game lives up to its promise of frantic fights with tricky maneuvering through crowds and careful use of magic. Before you know it, though, these fights are over and it's back to hacking through the simpletons again. A much bigger variety of monsters with different tactics and more battles would've made the action far better than the largely mindless hacking and slashing.    The culmination of the fighting takes place with the boss battles amid some quick and nasty opponents and an even nastier camera setup. In close quarters the camera has a terrible habit of snapping in close (as close as Nowe's belt), or zapping another way while whipping back and forth. Success requires as much careful positioning of Nowe to see what's happening as it does dodging the attacks and countering. I hope I don't give too much away when I say that the best thing to do is dodge and attack. Wash, rinse, repeat.   After a good 20-25 hours or so of this, players will be rewarded with an ending only to be told that this is the first of three possible endings. The others are unlocked by playing through again on the Hard setting and once more on Expert. Those who wish to collect all of the weapons and items will have plenty of replayability ahead and in that sense, Drakengard 2 is a tremendous value for those who love action games. But by then, the story and its multifaceted characters will have already been revealed and only the drive to get everything will remain to push players through. While there may be plenty of an okay fighting experience it's still just okay.    Drakengard 2 improves in every area of the original except where it needed it most: the repetitive gameplay. The massive amount of filler here is pretty apparent and it could've been easily dropped in favor of more interesting battles against more creatures. While the action can be fun in places and there's plenty to dig into with multiple levels of difficulty, the game still reaches too far in the wrong directions and loses track of creating a game that has a feeling of adventure in the levels that matches the fireworks that happen between the characters in the storyline.", "date": "Feb 16, 2006"}
