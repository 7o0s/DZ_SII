{"name": "Extermination", "name_review": "Extermination", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/07/27/extermination", "text": "Much like Dark Cloud, Sony's Extermination is one of those titles that seemed to generate a lot of hype when it was first announced before almost completely disappearing off of the face of the earth. Even after being released in Japan, there seemed to be very little interest on this side of the pond despite the fact that it received better than average reviews from its hometown press.  Once you play the game, though, you'll begin to understand why all of this happened. On the surface, Extermination has quite a lot to offer and it does enough things well that it's understandable that it could have generated some early excitement and fervor. On the other hand, the developers just weren't able to deliver a compelling gaming experience that would move one to try and get others excited about it, and as a consequence, the initial hype all but disappeared.    One of the areas where the game really shows some promise is with its fairly interesting action-thriller storyline that puts the player in the role of U.S. Special Forces Marines RECON team Red Light member Dennis Riley. On a mission that takes him to a military base in Antarctica, Riley, as controlled by the player, is thrust into a freakish escapade that melds elements of action games, adventure titles and survival horror.    Gameplay The main goal of the game, aside from the characteristic attempt to save the world, is to survive the deadly virus that has infected this remote establishment and destroy it before it's able to spread. And it's how the virus is handled where the game manages to separate itself a little from the rest of the pack.   Making use of an Infection meter in addition to the standard health meter, the developers have managed to create a greater sense of pressure to try and survive the quest. You see, when the player is infected by a virus, the Infection percentage will begin to increase and will do so until it completely takes over the character's body, and killing him, or you give him a vaccine at a medical facility. What's really cool about this is that the number doesn't just increase with only time, as other factors like the environment will factor in on how fast it spreads.   For instance, if you continuously walk through puddles of water, the virus will infect you quicker since it feeds on it. So, when infected, the player will have to be extra careful not to walk in water unless he has to, all the while trying to get cured as fast as possible, so he doesn't croak. It's this sense of urgency that's created by this and the music, which we'll discuss later, that really makes this game as enjoyable as it is.  While this aspect of the game is fairly original, the rest is pretty standard for the genre. The player control is very responsive and makes use of the preferred method by which the character moves in the direction that's pressed, instead of the rotation technique used in games like Resident Evil, which pressing left and right just rotates the character and pressing up and down moves him forwards and backwards.   But, that doesn't mean that you won't have any issues with the control because the game makes use of a sometimes-awkward camera that will act as if someone is controlling it that wants you to fail at the game. It's usually not a problem, but there'll be times that you'll fall of ledges or get attacked by creatures only because of the camera, and this is especially annoying because getting latched onto by one of these things means that you'll have to fend off the dreaded infection before you pass away.  The severity of camera problems in combat are lessened a little by the fact that there's a solid auto-aiming feature, but this also makes a lot of the combat elements fairly routine. While this works in games like Resident Evil where you have limited ammo and puzzle solving is the main object of the game, it doesn't bode that well for a game that's relies predominantly on action.   Whilst problems like these do keep Extermination from being a great title, there's still enough good here that'll allow most people to get some enjoyment out of it. The story, even if not completely fulfilled thanks to the lack of serious character development, is interesting enough that you'll want to play through the game, and the simple, straightforward gameplay has a pick up and play appeal that'll be perfect for someone that doesn't want to waste brain cells on puzzle solving and get right to the killing of mutated creatures.  Graphics When this game was first announced, the first screenshots that were shown depicted some high quality 3D models of this thing mutating and the question on everyone's minds was whether this was just pre-rendered CG or actual realtime gameplay. After some time, so additional screenshots were released and we soon found out that the actual in-game graphics weren't quite as impressive and that these first screens were just from the CG cut scenes.   Because of this, a lot of people who were initially interested in the game began to look elsewhere for their killer-app to use in fan boy system wars and began to ignore Extermination. That's too bad, though, because Extermination is actually a fairly nice looking game and has a lot going for it in the area of visuals. It comes nowhere close to the CG shots (no game that I've seen so far does), but it's one of the upper tier games on the system so far.  The biggest complaint that people could make is that most of the background environments are similarly colored and there are a lot of dark and color-less locales -- but that's the only way that a game in this kind of setting can be done. You're not going to find fruity colors and pastels in an Antarctic military base in real life, so you're not going to find that stuff in this game either.   Otherwise, what you get here are some finely detailed background elements and character models, with the only real downer being that the character animation is often stiff and a bit unrealistic. On the whole, Extermination is a good-looking game. It's not going to convince people of the power of PlayStation 2, but it's also not going to make someone get overly caught up in its flaws.  Sound This is the area of Extermination that I'm most impressed with, the audio. The game has some great ambient background sounds and that combined with the excellent music and high quality of sound samples on the whole, helps build the game's atmosphere and manages to create a sense of urgency that's not often felt in most other games of this type.   The voices have been getting some mixed reactions from people around here, but I'm pleased with the voice acting on the whole. Yes, most of the stuff is a bit campy and often cheesy, and you'll never mistake the voices in this game for a big budget feature film, but they're better than what you're typically given for a game of this type and they work with the basic setting and feel of the game. If you just look at the score, you'll probably come to the conclusion that Extermination is a bad game and wasn't something that I enjoyed playing. But, that's not quite the truth. I actually had a lot of fun playing through it, despite some initial misgivings, and didn't feel that it was a waste of my time in any way (a lot of games we have to review give off this feeling). It's just that Extermination is just an above average game and nothing more. If you're looking for something to keep you busy until the newer Resident Evils, Syphon Filters or Metal Gear Solids, this will probably do you just fine and you'll find that it's a lot of fun. But, don't expect something that'll be on par with the likes of Resident Evil 2, Code Veronica, Syphon Filter 2, or Metal Gear Solid, because Extermination just isn't a something that could be classified as a great game. It's not that bad, though. Not bad at all.", "date": "Jul 27, 2001"}
