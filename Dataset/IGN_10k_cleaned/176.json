The game boasts true-to-life physics that are remarkably realistic and detailed 3D environments that practically beg to be explored. It even has a four-player mode. In spite of all these features, though, this RC racer does not come recommended as any potential it might have had is obliterated by inexcusable framerates mixed with overly sensitive control.  The Facts   28 cars to find and control. Interactive environments. 14 single-player tracks set in seven different worlds. Five single-player gameplay modes. Four-player Racing and Battle multiplayer modes. Wide selection of pick-ups and weapons. Track editor. 4MB Expansion Pak support for medium-resolution mode.   Gameplay Re-volt began its life as a PC game -- and a very good one. Somewhere along the way, Acclaim's London Studios was contracted to port the product to Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and that's where everything went downhill. The idea behind the Nintendo 64 incarnation of the game, based on the PC original, is a strong one. Players race through tracks with their favorite remote-controlled vehicles, picking up bonus items and weapons in order to knock opponents out of the competition. The racing environments are composed of realistic and fantastical backdrops that are surely inspired by an RC fanatics' dreams, and include everything from museum floors to grocery stores, toy shops and neighborhood streets. And all of this is good and fine.  The problem lies in the execution of the Nintendo 64 version, which is sloppy, sluggish and at times, downright painful to play. Control, which is sometimes far too sensitive for its own good, is in constant battle with jittery framerates, leaving players frustrated somewhere in the middle. When the game runs smooth, the overly responsive controls aren't so much a problem, and in fact can serve to manipulate the vehicles quite nicely. But this is a situation that happens few and far between. As is often the case, turning rapidly around a bend into a wide-open area brings the action to a slide-show halt. Players press on the analog stick and wait for the framerate to fully catch up. By the time it does, though, the vehicle has spun out and players must reposition themselves back into the race. This is not acceptable.  Also, as gamers race through a track, it is often very difficult to tell where to go next. While arrows conveniently point a player on their way, it's easy to miss turns or simply race directly into a wall as it looks like something it isn't. In the museum, for example, we often find ourselves smashing into walls or taken aback by glass roadways as they serve to disorient and confuse more than they do impress.  The game's lineup of tracks includes:  Toys in the Hood (1) Super Market (2) Museum (2) Botanical Garden Toy World (1) Ghost Town (1) Toy World (2) Toys in the Hood (2) Toytanic (1) Museum (1) Super Market (1) Ghost Town (2) Toytanic (2)   Additionally, there is a stunt track and players can use the game's custom track-editor feature to create their own courses -- an option that, while a bit difficult to learn at first, actually works very well and is sure to add loads to replay value.  The multiplayer mode in Re-Volt suffers the same fate as the single player one. A sometimes unforgivably slow framerate keeps what would most likely be a fun situation from being so. Considering the fact that the realistic mechanics in Re-Volt prove to dish out an addictive experience for PC owners, we can only blame the Nintendo 64 version's faults on poor execution. It's as if Acclaim's London Studios learned nothing from the mistakes made in Extreme-G 2, another game that was far too sluggish to be enjoyable.  Graphics Re-Volt boasts some pretty visuals. The game's 3D vehicle models are highly detailed and animate realistically. The antennas on cars sway back and forth, for example, after landing hard on the ground. Tracks are equally detailed, giving gamers a glimpse of everyday environments from the view of a remote-control car. Everything looks gigantic. Street curbs turn into stone walls, street signs into towering buildings, parked cars into gargantuan alien objects. Speed bumps are transformed into high-flying jumps, as are dirt-hills and even misplaced signage and ramps. The game's visibility is significant, enabling players to see well into the distance, only blocked by a faint haze of green fog. Sounds great, right?  Enter framerate. Everything goes to hell once we introduce the game's fluidity (or lack thereof) into the graphics department. Re-Volt is beyond sluggish at times. It's often so slow that we find ourselves noticing when everything seems to be running smoothly for a brief moment. A questionable framerate can be overlooked in, say, an action game, or perhaps a first-person shooter. But for a racing game -- a title that's primarily about going fast -- this is not an option. Very disappointing.   Sound The game's music is exceedingly well-executed. The beats -- from the opening theme to the in-game tunes -- are catchy and atmospheric. Even those in our office who weren't particularly impressed by the music could be heard unknowingly humming it throughout the day. The sound effects are appropriate enough, delivering up a fresh catch of screeches, skids, crashes, clunks, thuds, and weapon noises. Nothing particular out of the ordinary -- everything just right for the situation. Re-Volt is a fun, beautiful racer... for PC owners. For Nintendo 64 owners, it's a slow, sloppy, frustrating racing game. Blame it on poor execution if you will. Or blame it on the fact that Nintendo 64's hardware has begun to show its age, and is having more and more difficulty keeping up with today's crop of PC software. Whatever you blame it on, the fact of the matter is that Re-Volt for Nintendo 64 is not a fun game. Its control is too responsive and framerate too stuttering slow to make for a game that's even ~remotely~ playable. If you're interested in this game and you own a PC, by all means pursue the original version of the title. The Nintendo 64 port does not come recommended.", "date": "Aug 20, 1999"}
