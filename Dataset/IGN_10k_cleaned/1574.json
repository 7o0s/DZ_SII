But with the cartoon version of Buzz Lightyear of Star Command, with its clunky animation and cornball characters, the show is a let-down. And, as all of us who have played a Toy Story videogame before know, the fame versions have been equally upsetting. So until Pixar starts making its own videogames and cartoons, we have to put up with dreck like this to play with Buzz and the bunch. Whoo boy, Woody, I'm sure glad you didn't get stuck up in this mess of trouble.    Features:  Based on the Disney Saturday Morning cartoon 12 levels across ice and space Collect new weapons and ride a Hoverboard or Jet Bike Only for Game Boy Color   The Game Boy Color version of Buzz Lightyear is based fairly faithfully on the PlayStation and Dreamcast games. Unfortunately, those games weren't too hot, playing as quick cash-ins on the cheapie cartoon with lots of explosions and no logic to the herky-jerky gameplay. That's filtered down to this handheld version, and without any fancy graphics to distract us, the gameplay faults seep the stink out.  This is a game where you're chasing a villain to try to apprehend and stop their plan, and yet the programming is so ooky that it's possible to pass the guy you're chasing. You literally have to wait at the end of the course for them to hurry up and cause whatever mischief they were planning on (since there's no way to stop them), then beat them up and apprehend the villain for their wrongdoing. Yep, it's pretty silly.  Things like that might slide if the gameplay were strong with this game, but here the physics and control is just painfully heavy. Buzz runs like an unstoppable bull, and turns like a Buick. After playing every stage, my hands were cramped from constantly fighting the controls.  Buzz has an arsenal of weapons at his command, but as with the controls, the guns aren't much fun to play with even at their best. Even pumped up to all kinds of crazy levels, they still take loads of shots to take out the respawning enemies. The game makes players collect coins to get power-ups, but coins are so abundant that it's never tough. The only challenge of the game is getting through the wonky mission features -- sometimes you have to shoot the baddie with a specially colored gun, other times you have to complete some random task. In any case, it never tells you what you're doing wrong.  Unlike the PSX / DC versions of this game, there aren't really multiple paths or multiple missions in the game. It does have multiple rankings through the level, but it's still hardly reason to repeat the game's 12 stages (half of which are repeats across virtually identical scenery). It's also missing some of the more fun parts of the game -- with the next-gen versions, the designers knew that Hoverboards are cool. Super cool. So they had Buzz do some rad tricks on the Hoverboard just for fun, and they also crafted levels that specifically had him trickin' across the land. Here, Hoverboards just sort of cruise forward pointlessly. It's more fun to walk.  And visually, the game is yucky stuff. With no real special effects, there's nothing to hide the plain and screwy characters, like big blue elephant thingies and big yellow robot thingies. Buzz is drawn as basically as possible, but the enemy bosses at least have some character in their design. And the worlds are vague and empty, with very few landmarks to show that any progress is being made.       Traveller's Tales has landed on the Game Boy Color, and already they're committing some of the same sins that have plagued their history. Oh, you know Traveller's Tales... makers of the PlayStation versions of Rascal, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, the disappointing Sonic R. They've got a history of schmexcellence, but got on for years with pretty graphics. But now they're on the Game Boy Color, without their covert book of diversion tactics. Sloppy games like Buzz Lightyear of Star Command are just the start. You've been warned.", "date": "Dec 2, 2000"}
