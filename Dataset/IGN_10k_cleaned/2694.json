Developed by Opus, the same team that handled the PlayStation version of the initial installment all those seasons ago, UFC Throwdown returns to the octagon in an effort to capture the increasingly popular sport of No-Holds Barred Combat.Although the original game appeared on both PlayStation and Sega Dreamcast (with the latter version handled by upcoming Pride FC developer Anchor Inc.), Throwdown seems to be heavily inspired by the non-Opus offering on the Swirl. An interesting decision by the programmers for sure, the latest Ultimate Fighting Championship emanates familiarity. But could it be too familiar? Let's explore.Featuressize=5>From the outset, you may notice that Throwdown's feature set seems pretty familiar. While its good to see that old time mainstays like UFC Mode, Career, and Training are still the primary cogs in the engine, it was still a bit disappointing not to find any new options or selections to choose from. While major improvements have been made in some of the old school categories, there's always room for more.The strange thing is, a lot of the modes are rather similar. Arcade is just a test to see how many guys in a row you can pummel before being taken out yourself, while UFC Mode is a slightly more difficult version of the four-tier tournament selection. Training mode is pretty self explanatory and mirrors every other training option in the 3D fighting world, while Career is a create-a-character session akin to most wrestling titles.At least the game has been structured rather admirably. Subtly forcing players to try their hand at everyone in order to unlock new moves for create a fighter and advance in the open weight UFC Mode, gamers must complete a tournament with each fighter in order to use their abilities and likenesses in other parts of the game. By doing so, you continue to unlock new features and characters while playing every available mode. It's a smart way to tackle the traditional problem of figuring out which is important. In UFC Throwdown they all are.Our favorite option however, has to be the Career Mode. Planned and executed in a much more effective way than before, it is one of the better modes of its type. Ditching the idea that you get points to spend on attributes through fighting, Anchor has reversed its thinking and given you a certain amount of points to begin with. Once you've chosen your height, weight, fighting style, and color, it's off to hone your skills.Spending your points like a driving game, you're presented with a series of challenges. For each challenge completed your Frankenstein will earn a new move, ability, or combination thereof. Once you think you're good enough, spar in 5 matches and you'll earn more points to which you can learn all new abilities and go up fighting levels just like an RPG.What's particularly cool about it is, that just like in real no-holds barred fighting you can choose a different martial art to learn with each ascending level. Being well rounded in every discipline is key to becoming a champion in today's bare-fisted climate and UFC has captured this perfectly. What this translates to in terms of the game's career structure is phenomenal and allows a varied type of fighter above and beyond the type you could create in the previous game. So while you may start your career as a kick boxer you can curve yourself towards the Jiu Jitsu discipline and finish it off in pit fighting; excellent decision by the developers.In fact, the only change we'd make to the career mode is aesthetic as there should have been a larger selection of faces, outfits, and similar accessories to further personalize your creation.  It's a feature that's know to add quite a bit of extra zing to otherwise gameplay-light endeavors (re: WWF Smackdown! Just Bring It).Gameplaysize=5>Of course you could have the most advanced and varied feature set in the world, but if the gameplay sucks, it won't matter. Happily UFC doesn't fall victim to such a fate, and offers hundreds and thousands of in-ring moves, grapples, counters, and techniques. Including a much more prominent emphasis on using the cage to your advantage, whereas you can actually grab your opponent by the head and slam it against the bars.The average session plays very much like Tekken, where stiff, tap-tap motions are made to string together combos and basic attacks. Matching the familiar system button-for-button, the top face keys are left and right punches, while the bottom two chimes in as the kicks. Borrowing its grappling method from Namco's multi-selling fighter as well, you can muscle around with your opponent by simultaneously pressing Triangle and Circle or Square and X. And let us not forget the counter setup, which is handled by pressing both punches and kicks at the same time.Once you've mastered the basics, getting into an exhibition or even career is almost chess-like: Easy to learn, difficult to master. With so many varying factors like Endurance, Stamina, Speed, Punching Skill, etc to worry about, matches can end in mere seconds or go the complete timed distance. It's all a matter of style, ability, and panache. Identical is almost every way to the first UFC title, Throwdown has a strong fighting engine that's chalk full of value, but that's also what keeps it from becoming one of the top PS2 Fighters: It's similarity to the original game.    Differentiated only by an altered selection of fighters and slight modifications to the existing combat engine, playing through Throwdown consistently gave us the feeling of dj vu. While the game was a groundbreaking step towards making fighters more realistic a couple of years ago, the developers didn't make any major strides in furthering the genre. Even the game's original two-five throws per person have been left untouched.Where is the incentive for a fan of the original game to return if at its core, Throwdown is the same thing we've seen before? Unlike sports titles where slight modifications and roster changes are enough to keep a series going, the demand for a fighter is much higher. That's not to say that the game still isn't pretty solid in terms of depth and entertainment, but when you've played hundreds of matches in the previous effort only to revisit it with few changes, there's no real payoff. Capcom realized this long ago with the Street Fighter series for instance, which is probably why we haven't seen a new ~Alpha~ or ~II~ game in years.Graphicssize=5>I hate to admit it, but visually Throwdown appears to have taken a step backward. Two years ago on the Sega Dreamcast, the original game had some of the most realistic representations of body hair and skin that I'd ever seen. Still holding up with that mantle to this very day, I went in to the PS2 effort with the same high expectations. Ineffectually, those expectations were not met.While the character models are a lot more refined and realistic in terms of physicality, the textures pasted onto those bodies just don't measure up. Seemingly running at a lower resolution than the two-year old Dreamcast predecessor and far less detailed, the almost blurry presentation left a lot to be desired. Other strange anomalies, like an obviously full-motion video crowd matched up with out of place real-time polygonal fighters and the bizarrely deformed and misshapen heads give the impression that the whole graphical approach was somewhat of an afterthought.Refreshingly, there has been at least one visual improvement: Lighting and special effects. Instead of the unchanged de facto shadows we've grown accustomed too, your fighter's silhouette actually changes realistically depending on the position of the floodlights. The chain link mesh attached to the octagonal arena bends, moves, and recoils flawlessly, with blood spattering in a gravitationally correct trajectory. Now if only the developers had decided to add facial damage and body bruises for a more realistic effectSoundsize=5>Every audible aspect of UFC Throwdown is powerfully loud. Whether we're talking about the opening cinema and its banging heavy metal score or the mean clang of iron that's activated during menu selections, your speakers will definitely get a workout.The voice-over work handled by ring announced Bruce Buffer and referee Mario Yamasaki is accurate and of high quality, but is strangely synched with its onscreen counterparts. Forever caught in a ~wa-wa~ facial animation, watching and listening to ring introductions at the same time is akin to a cheap Hong Kong action flick.Other audio nuggets are somewhat non-existent, as the crowd hoots and hollers during intros, but decidedly settles down when watching the in-ring fights. Appropriately reacting to nice counters or attack combinations, the audience reaches a level of interaction, but certainly not on the lines of other trendsetters like World Series Baseball or FIFA. The agonizing screams and whelps let out when demolishing your opponent isn't too hot either.A tossed bag of good, great, and not so, UFC Throwdown can make for some intense gaming sessions. Lacking the variety and improvements that we originally hoped we'd find in a sequel, the strange resonance of ~I've done this before~ steals a couple of much-valued points from the overall score.But for those of you who never experienced the Dreamcast classic or aren't too opinionated when it comes to the more aesthetic touches of videogames, Throwdown is definitely a fighting experience worthy of your precious time. For owners of the original however, we offer a cautious recommendation and a pair of crossed-fingers to boot; Keep those expectations in check.", "date": "Jun 5, 2002"}
