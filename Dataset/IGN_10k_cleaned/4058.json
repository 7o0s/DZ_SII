Though it would have been enough to simply revamp Empire Earth, the team's gone well beyond the promise of their first game by focusing on depth rather than breadth. Naturally a game that has 1000 years of military conflict as a backdrop has to have some breadth, but judged against the 3000 years presented in the previous game, 1000 years is considered tight by Stainless Steel standards.   Though I genuinely liked Empire Earth there were a few things that bothered me about the title. For one, the broad swath through history offered very little chance to really focus on specific events and characters through history. Missions had little connection to each other (other than occurring in historical sequence) and the graphics left a lot to be desired, particularly in terms of buildings. Thankfully, these issues all seem to have been addressed in this new title. (Although not technically a sequel, Empires: Dawn of the Modern World is clearly an extension of and variation on the ideas presented in Empire Earth.)   Three main campaigns are presented here. You can wage war as the English against the French in King Richard's campaign, take on the role of General Yi as he leads the Koreans against the Chinese and even direct Patton and his forces as they push from North Africa into the heart of Nazi Germany. Each of the campaigns are punctuated by spectacular cutscenes and some first-rate speeches. In all they're much more story-oriented than the missions in Empire Earth and definitely help to make the world matter to the player.   There's an increasing trend in the real-time strategy genre to get away from the notion of completely exterminating your enemy. I, for one, am thankful. While total destruction of the enemy is still fun as an option, I much prefer to have scenarios that ask the player to achieve a much more limited and focused objective. In the case of Empires you have missions that end once you capture key buildings or units. You'll even have plenty of smaller objectives within each mission (some of which are entirely optional if not entirely incidental). Having to find a way to trap some drunken soldiers on one map is a refreshing but not overly puzzling distraction.   I also have to commend Stainless Steel for breaking down the barriers between the missions. Apart from the narrative continuity between the missions within the three campaigns, you'll also find that the game offers frequent changes and updates in terms of objectives. This makes one mission feel like three in some cases. Since the maps are so huge (generally speaking), you'll rarely find yourself without new territory to explore, even when you've been playing on the same map for a full hour.   For some, this may be a bit intimidating. The very idea of sitting down and starting a mission with no clear end in sight even discouraged me at points. But the large spaces you can play in and the dynamic objectives are a huge draw and a great way to exercise your tactical skills. Though the maps are designed with clear boundaries and chokepoints, there's room for a fair bit of maneuvering here. When you add in the ability of certain units (and units from certain empires) to traverse otherwise impassable terrain, you're freed up even more to move units in behind your enemy in interesting and surprising ways.    There are four empires available in the early ages of the game and five more once you reach the later stages. Though the units you control in the single player game are restricted to the English, Koreans and Americans, you can play through the multiplayer game as any of the nine empires. The four that exist at the beginning of the game (the English, Franks, Koreans and Chinese) have the option to transform in to one of two new nations once they reach the modern age. In other words, a Frankish player will have to become either French or German once they enter the World War II age.    Since we've already covered each of the unique abilities and units of the separate empires in earlier features, we'll dispense with a detailed analysis of what each is capable of and merely say that each civilization has very unique bonuses that distinguish them from one another. A handy pop up lets you see the relevant statistics for units on the screen. You can tell then which of your troops are best used against certain types of enemies.   Once you're done with the campaigns (which is a long time, let me tell you) you'll have endless options in multiplayer. In addition to the standard settings, Empires: Dawn of the Modern World also includes two game types -- one geared for quick action and one geared for long defensive battles. Personally, I'm for the long and drawn out conflicts but the action-oriented matches are nice if you've only got thirty minutes to spare. An unsupported editor is also included for those who'd like to design their own scenarios and campaigns.   The game's AI is a formidable opponent. It can take advantage of special movement abilities (Frankish archers won't come out of the damn woods to fight fairly) and even knows how to retreat towards fortifications or other allied units. I did find a few problems with the individual unit AI, primarily with the path-finding of the bigger, less maneuverable units. Groups of infantry seem to do just fine. When you get a few battleships or tanks together though, even the most diligent formation management can't keep them from knocking in to each other and pushing each other around. Even when moved in groups, certain units tended to block each other's ability to turn. While it's not a big problem when you're moving out, it can cause lots of frustration when you actually need to start maneuvering in the presence of an enemy. Also on the subject of AI, there are a few situations where you'll want your units to show more initiative. Snipers tend not to fire at units at the extreme limit of their range, despite being able to drop infantry in one shot.   Since the overall game and the campaigns themselves focus on a narrower band of history than Empire Earth, there's much less of a sense of technological momentum here. You won't start with cavemen and end up with cuirassiers for instance. Even so advancing among the game's handful of ages has been streamlined. No longer do you have to meet a variety of prerequisites before moving on to new ages. Now you'll simply need to pay a hefty resource cost to move from one age to the next. On that topic, the team has removed iron as a resource, further simplifying the economy of the game.    As in Empire Earth, the camera in Empires allows you to get right down on the action with an incredibly free-roaming camera. But there are two things about the camera that seem, well, stupid to me. While the wheel-controlled zoom and edge bump scrolling work exactly as you'd expect them to, camera rotation seems like two different systems. At higher zoom levels, the camera rotates around a reasonably identifiable focal point. Move the mouse left and the camera tracks to the right. But once you zoom all the way in, the camera itself becomes the pivot point while maintaining the same left looks right, right looks left scheme. While it might sound like a small issue, it's taken me a hell of a long time to get used to it. I suppose I'd rather see a model that reserved the top half of the sides of the screen for rotation on the point of view with the bottom half offering the standard sideways scrolling.    While I appreciate the ability click and drag on the map to scroll the view, the fact that you scroll the camera and not the environment is just counter intuitive. When you hold down the middle mouse button and move the mouse down the land should scroll down across the screen. Instead it's the camera that moves down giving the impression that the land is moving up towards the top of the screen. Again, this is definitely a matter of preference (and somewhat nitpicky) but it runs completely counter to my expectations.   The only other problem with the extreme close up views is that it's much less easy to actually play the game from this perspective. Not only do other units and structures block your view of potential targets for movement or combat, but the foreshortened terrain makes it hard to move your units exactly where you want them. Thankfully a quick double-click gets you back to the default overhead view.   Still, you have to appreciate the fact that Stainless Steel lets you get so close to the action. I simply can't think of an RTS this good that lets you get this close to your units. When dropped down the ground, the camera reveals lots of fantastic detail on each of the units. Seeing the barding on horses or Patton's ivory-handled revolvers (or is it mother-of-pearl?) really brings the game to life and definitely enhances the toy soldiers aspect of the game. Stainless Steel has gone beyond the mere painted miniatures aspect of Empire Earth to present a real, living world.   The units themselves have lots of little animations that enhance the illusion of life. Although you will see some small instances of ~twinning~ (an animation term describing two characters moving in perfect unison), most of the time the small idle animations are out of sequence just enough to keep things from looking odd. There are a few small animations that look a bit silly in close up (cavalry troops seem to thrust their hips back and forth on their saddles and engineers wave fire extinguishers around when repairing vehicles, for instance) they are, for the most part, generally understated. Small touches like tracking turrets on ships and tanks are a nice, natural-seeming addition.    From a standpoint of stability, the game has performed wonderfully. Apart from the odd crash (caused, it seems, by our screen capture program) the only other technical issue we encountered was in having to manually copy the files for one scenario directly from the disc. Since this only occurred once in the three times we installed the game, we assume this is an isolated bug.  Stainless Steel deserves to be proud of their second effort. Having taken the shortcomings of their first game to heart, they've managed to present us with a title that fixes what needed fixing and adds a lot more besides. It's hard to balance the epic conception of the game with the intensely personal and intimate nature of the campaigns but Stainless Steel has managed to pull it all off somehow creating a game that cuts through a thousand years of history and still has characters that we care about.In terms of negatives, the camera's not as friendly as it could be in terms of compromising overall playability. Those gamers who prefer more of an economic focus will find the single player campaign a bit light in this department. Those who prefer the tactics of fixed force battles will find the economy in multiplayer is no more burdensome than it is in other games in this genre.Ultimately this is a good direction for the genre. You're willing to tolerate the larger missions because the pacing and narrative continuity keeps you interested in nearly every minute of the action. Multiplayer offers some compelling variations among the empires that gives each side (and each combat pairing) a unique character. Though the traditional RTS still has a lot of life left in it, it's nice to play through a title that presents things in a different format.", "date": "Oct 23, 2003"}
