Bowling video games, then, need to serve both the casual armchair hurler and the grizzled alley veteran. So Jack of All Games had a minor challenge in developing the first bowling game for Xbox -- it had to appeal to a broad audience. AMF Bowling 2004 may be the only hope for Xbox owners wanting to bowl a few games without getting off their ass, but the game really isn't likely to be appealing to anyone.   Gameplay Featuring such hot names as Stash Richards and Hooty Davis, the $20 AMF Bowling is the Sarah Plain and Tall of bowling games. Sure, it's diligent and gets the job done, but man is it bare bones and, well, boring. Rather than offering a dynamic new way to bowl in a video game (analogue bowling people!), Jack of All Games chose to go with the standard triple-A meter. First you mark the power, then accuracy, and finally spin. It takes about two games to get the rhythm down, but once you do, you'll likely be a bowling dynamo.   Making things trickier is the use of oil on the lanes (which you can view by pressing X). Whether you realize it or not, oil actually affects you whenever you bowl, especially if you use a big hook. The physics are very good, about as good as they can get in a bowling game. For that, Jack gets a golf clap. However, there's nothing in the game that explains how oil will affect your ball or how different settings will change your approach when creating your own custom b-ball. A few sentences here or there as a help guide would make an easier time of it for casual bowlers and would probably teach them a few things they could use in real life on the lanes.  The create a bowler aspect is relatively sparse, but that goes along with the rest of the game. Though there are seven real-life bowling alleys to choose from, none of them have any personality (or other bowlers). Imagine going bowling after finding out you're the last person alive on earth, only with pants on. The only time you see other folks are when you bowl against them, and if it's the CPU, then get ready for boredom, because you have to watch as these slow rollers bowl between frames. Bo-ring! Things do pick up when you play against a friend, but the lack of any bells, whistles, or fun make for 20 dollars better spent playing a few games at the local AMF alley.    Graphics Gotta love the power of the Xbox. Nothing says ~we like making PC games~ than a budget title with no frills, weak animations, terrible character models, and a lack of visual pop. The changing camera angles when you bowl are a nice touch, but there's no joy in the visuals, no reward for scoring a Turkey (three strikes in a row) and there aren't even hot, drunk college girls bowling in the lane next to you.  Sound Bowling's never been so quiet. Since you're the only one on the lane, the alley sounds quite vacant. The pin sounds are fine, but the music (all two songs) gets old fast. At least there are some commentators to -- oh wait, there aren't any. Well, you do have players saying stuff -- oh, that's right, none of that either. Hey, at least there are custom sound -- crap, none of that. Awesome.I love me some computer bowling, I really do. Not as much as the real deal, but a fun bowling game can eat away some dull moments in the day. AMF Bowling 2004 doesn't try to do anything new and can't even offer some of the oomf seen in bowling games from the past. If you have to have a bowling game on your Xbox, well, this is it. Otherwise, spend your money somewhere else. F#@$ it Dude, let's go bowling.", "date": "Feb 4, 2004"}
