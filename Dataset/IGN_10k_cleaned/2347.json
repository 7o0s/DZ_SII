It's a true Hot Wheels experience, plus it's supposed to be extreme. You're not confined to just roadsters, your Hot Wheel can transform into a monster truck, a boat, and a plane.  Sounds cool, huh?  Don't go digging into your wallet just yet.  While Hot Wheels Extreme Racing may not have a lot of technical issues, it does suffer from a lack of fun.   The modes of play are the standard racing fare.  There is a tournament mode, time trials, and single race modes as well as a multiplayer mode that enables up to four players to race each other. The tournament mode is the bread and butter of any racing game and here it's no exception. As you compile racing wins, new tracks become playable and upgrade options for finer, faster Hot Wheel cars become available, too. Get a bigger engine or some new wings for when you transform.    There are 12 tracks in single-player mode and 12 different tracks in multiplayer mode.  Twenty-four tracks: Very cool.  Only being able to play 12 of them in single-player mode:  Crap.  The levels themselves vary from lava filled tracks to icy realms to the very edges of space, you know the standard fare. Unfortunately, rather than feeling like 24 separate levels, these tracks feels more like the same level redone numerous times.  Instead of lava, they use water.  Instead of water, try use ice.  Few of the levels feel unique and the tracks become repetitive quickly.  Perhaps HotGen would have been better served going the MicroMachine route, making the game a racer in and out of buildings with real-life obstacles to foul up drivers.  Gameplay Driving a Hot Wheel is easy.  Hold down X to accelerate.  There are buttons for brakes and even a handbrake, but you'll never use them.  It's a bit of a crock to toss in a useless handbrake button to offer the appearance that you can powerslide in the game.  You can't.  I wouldn't have even thought of it had HotGen not put in the button.  It's like giving me an empty pizza box at dinnertime.  I love pizza, but what use is an empty box??  You just made me more hungry!  For added fun, there is a jump/stunt button which is really just a jump button.  When you are in plane mode, you can do a Top Gun style roll that doesn't help you at all, but maybe it is slightly ~extreme.~  There are pick-ups on the track that range from missiles to mines to oil slicks.  Just drive over them (or use that ~helpful~ jump button) to scoop them up.  Just one small thing: You can only hold one power-up at a time, and, unfortunately, the power-ups come in small doses. Guided missiles only come one per power-up, for example.  So you might get off one shot but then you're weaponless again.    The power-ups are good for taking out fellow racers (of which there are three), but they're the standard fare. It would have been cool to have something unique thrown into the bunch, instead of using every single power-up you've seen in a million other racers.     The transformation aspect of the game would seem to be its strong point.  After all, your vehicle can cover four different types of terrain by transforming into a boat, plane, car, or monster truck. And yet, it's really quite plainly enacted. You don't get to choose when to transform.  When the terrain changes to water, you'll automatically transform into a boat.  Turning into a plane should be damn cool.  Damn cool I say!  But it's not.  You can't move up or down as you fly, just left or right.  What's the point of flying if you can't actually fly??  It's just another empty pizza box.  No racing game would be complete without a multiplayer function. You can team up against up to three friends through split screen competition.  The multiplayer actually seemed to run smoother than the single player mode.  Multiplayer is mildly enjoyable, but only for a short while.  By the third race my friends where begging me to put in something else, anything else.  The multiplayer runs fine, but it's still the same game deep down.    Graphics The game isn't pretty, but HotGen has managed to avoid any serious technical flaws.  There's very little pop-up and no noticeable slowdown.  Still, the levels don't feel unique enough and there's no interactivity with the environment (other than plunging into a pit of lava or the like).  The vehicle designs leave something to be desired.  Part of the Hot Wheels phenomenon is that there are so many cars to collect.  Here, there are only a handful of cars to play.  It's a pretty weak selection that could use some classic cars to make the game more hip.  Or maybe driving a '65 hardtop Mustang isn't extreme enough.  The weapon effects are just fine.  Explosions look significantly devastating and there's no way you want to get in the way of a flamethrower.  I can't figure out why the game feels sluggish in single player mode but ran smoother in multiplayer mode.  Usually you anticipate some slow down when you hit multiplayer mode, but it ran fine through each track.  Sound There was sound in this game?  Oh, see, I turned off the volume early on to avoid the annoying music that gets old faster than a slice of cheese left on top of the refrigerator.  The sound effects are adequate but not thrilling.  Like the rest of the game, the sound fails to immerse you in the racing experience.  Not bad, but not great.  Certainly not extreme.OK, OK.  I've been pretty harsh on ye olde Hot Wheels throughout this review.  I can live with a bit of choppy framerate or occasional clipping in a game (of which little is found here), but what I can't stand is boring gameplay.  Hot Wheels Extreme Racing is technically solid, but what matters is whether or not it's any fun.  I couldn't find anyone who wanted to play more than a few races.  And that's bad for a racing game.  You might notice Hot Wheels doesn't get a totally scummy rating.  In fact, it gets a very average 5.0.  That's because the game runs fine, looks all right, and doesn't frustrate with the controls.  But it fails to get anything beyond a 5.0 because it's not much fun at all.  And well, who the heck wants to play a game they can't enjoy?Color me prejudice, but when a game calls itself ~extreme~ it should include something ~extreme.~  The entire time I was playing Hot Wheels Extreme Racing, I could hear the voice of Poochie (the extradited mutt from The Itchy and Scratchy Show) shouting ~To the EXTREME!~  Well, if you know your Simpsons, you know that there is nothing extreme about Poochie.  Marketing folks have got a serious jones for the word extreme.  It's everywhere.  Well, I am taking a stand.  If you call it extreme, it damn well better be extreme.", "date": "Dec 4, 2001"}
