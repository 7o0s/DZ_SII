Unsurprisingly, Spider-Man 3 very much picks up where the earlier games left off, giving players a big city to explore, plenty of missions to trigger, a host of moves in combat and a few 'cinematic' tweaks to the action. But has the team done enough to differentiate this entry from previous titles? And more importantly, is it fun? Read on to find out.   If you've played any of the Spider-Man titles of the last few years you'll have a good grounding for Spider-Man 3. The game puts the city of New York at your sticky fingertips, and it's as densely packed as it is huge; a riot of housing, skyscrapers and parkland that spans every city block from Harlem to Battery Park, with plenty of other familiar New York boroughs - such as the Upper East and West Sides, Mid-Town, Union Square and the Financial District, in-between. Zoom out to the city map and you'll have an at-a-glance view of the entire metropolis, from which you can see which missions and activities are available, and easily set up a waypoint to get you there amongst the hustle and bustle. For all its size, however, Spider-Man 3's vision of New York doesn't have a huge amount of character. Aside from several prominent landmarks (such as Times Square) and locations from the film (such as the church where Emo-Spidey goes to seek redemption), once you've seen one skyscraper, you've seen them all.    That's for interrupting my dance routine. Now, back to the Emo-Spidey Shuffle.  Even so, the size of the city gives you plenty of room to sling about, and once again it's the webbing mechanics that are hands-down the highlight of the game. Not only is it - in terms of the gaming pantheon - a unique way to get around, it's undeniably good fun too, allowing Spider-Man to speed down straights, whip around corners, vault over lower buildings and dive-bomb towards the street before shooting out a line at the last minute to skim just over the tops of the million and one taxi cabs that seem to make up most of New York's traffic. It's a joyousness in movement that brings to mind titles like Prince of Persia and Crackdown. That said, where a series like Prince of Persia wraps this vivacity of movement around compelling level design, not to mention solid action and storytelling, Spider-Man 3 falls down somewhat. In fact, the comparison with Crackdown is probably more apt, as both have worlds that are huge and great fun to explore (albeit for completely different reasons), but when it comes to the missions, there's very little substance.   On the surface it looks like you're spoiled for choice in the world of Spider-Man 3. At any one point there will be three or more main story missions available, as well as a host of other things to do. For instance, you can head to the Daily Bugle to be assigned photography missions (take photos of a gothic-lolita fashion parade that turns into a catfight - woo!), take Mary Jane on a ~Thrillride~ (faster Spidey, faster!), covertly help out the cops, choose from a number of race and skydiving challenges, and even go on Combat Tours to see how fast you can clean up a neighbourhood.    Dark and mysterious, like an, erm, radioactive web-shooting panther slinking through the jungle.  The story missions, however, are very much the core of the game, and there are ten stories to play through. You'll go up against villains from the film such as Sandman and New Goblin, take down a host of game exclusive big bads such as Scorpion, Lizard and Kingpin, and even face off against the three gangs occupying the city: Apocalypse, a bunch of painfully stereotypical white guy punks - if you thought the gangs in 'Rumble in the Bronx' were cringeworthy, you ain't seen nothing yet; Arsenic Candy, an entirely female gang made up of gothic-lolitas with massive platform shoes and umbrellas; and Dragon Tail, the obligatory martial arts gang, whose fighters jump around almost as much as Spidey.    Treyarch has tried to make the missions engaging by utilising a wide number of environments, both above ground and below, so you'll be fighting on the streets, going through the sewers, along the underground rail system and through hi-tech research facilities. The team has also expanded nicely on Spidey's combat abilities, and as you'd expect, combat is fast and over-the-top. The Spider-Man games have always captured an exaggerated comic book take on combat and Spidey 3 takes that even further. Mashing the face buttons (jump, web/grab, light attack, heavy attack) sees Spidey unleash punishing combos, while more considered players will web-yank enemies up into the air for a bit of pummelling before slamming them to the ground (or better still juggling several enemies in the one sequence).    The game also utilises a good slow-mo system, whereby enemies signpost their attacks, allowing you to hold the left bumper to duck or dive out of the way, and possibly follow through with a counter-attack. So there's definitely some strategy in the combat, and the further into the game you get, the more moves and combos you unlock. Unfortunately though, there are also plenty of missed opportunities and frustrations - Super Attacks are pretty inconsequential, often exploding in a shower of nothing, there's no manual lock-on, boss battles over-rely on the slow-mo to the point where it's ridiculous, and the various web attacks are quite inconsistent.   You spin me right round baby right round like a record baby... you get the idea.  Interactive cutscenes have also been sprinkled liberally throughout each mission, presumably in an attempt to keep the game feeling dynamic and cinematic, and can spring from just about anywhere. Boss fights are typically heavy on the interactive cutscenes, moving from real-time combat to sequences where you must enter commands as they pop up on screen, giving the game a somewhat cinematic edge, but never much oomph. The first encounter with New Goblin for instance, is tepid at best, although there are moments of drama where you must enter the right combination as you're both careening towards a wall in order to - as Missy Elliott once said - ~flip it and reverse it~. The interactive cutscenes are used regularly throughout the rest of the game as well - want to go to the end of that corridor? Better bust out some Simon Says acrobatics to get there.   There's no doubt the ingredients are very much there to create a compelling experience, but they just haven't been capitalised on. The mission designs as a whole are repetitive and unadventurous, pandering to the most basic conventions of genre design, leaving us feeling like we've played this game before. Most missions - aside from some woeful boss battles - don't really do anything drastically wrong, but fail to do anything new or exciting. The familiar pattern of taking a linear path through a mission, stopping off to beat up some guys, flip a switch, watch an interactive cutscene or three, then 'solve' some puzzles before beating up a few more guys just isn't interesting, and attempts to mix things up with bomb defusing mini-games, a photo mechanic and sections where you must tail suspects still lack spark. We also question the wisdom of setting so many missions in enclosed spaces. In short, it cramps Spidey's style.   Saying something about the   The missions are broken up into bite-sized chunks, and the player's hand is held throughout, with constant waypoints and Spidey sense to guide you to your next encounter. While this is obviously designed to reduce potential frustration - there'd be nothing worse than wandering around for five minutes looking for a switch to flick after all, it winds up feeling like you're slavishly following a path that's been mapped out for you. And besides, Teryarch baked plenty of frustration into some of the more repetitive combat anyway.   But what of the visuals? Well, while it doesn't scream 'next-gen', Spider-man 3 mostly holds its own. The city is certainly large - if a little unexciting at times, the frame rate is smooth for the most part, the fighting animations are great and some of the interactive cutscenes are quite stylish, but there's definitely a lack of personality in many of the character designs, not to mention a lack of detail in the models. Fair enough given the scope of the city we guess.  By and large Spider-Man 3 is a competent game, and we dare say that younger, more casual players will probably lap it up. Yet for us, it just smacks of lazy design, and its a real shame that the huge city, great web slinging mechanics and fun combat are let down by a lack of compelling mission-based gameplay. In short, the bulk of the gameplay just isnt that much fun and often crosses over into frustration. In many ways Spider-Man 3 is a lot like the film its based around  a melting pot of characters, action and set pieces that sounds good on paper, but fails to come together in a satisfying way. This is a gaming dish that has all the ingredients for a feast of sights and sounds, but in the end, it just tastes like vanilla.Want to have your say?
