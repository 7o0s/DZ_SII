But there's more to this noble sport than whacking a really hard ball at your opponent's head, as any cricket fan will tell you. In fact it's an incredibly action-packed sport, with big-hitting action, diving catches and, um, men in silly hats.   All of which translates very well over to Xbox 360 and Brian Lara 2007, which is a surprisingly enjoyable yet faithful recreation of cricket. Don't worry if you don't know the first thing about googlies or leg-bys either, because it's especially easy-going on beginners. This is thanks to a simple but entertaining tutorial, narrated by Jonathan 'Aggers' Agnew, that prepares inexperienced players for the main attraction - the ICC Cricket World Cup 2007, which has just kicked off for real in the West Indies.     Despite the tutorial being aimed squarely at novices even the most ardent cricket fan is best off giving it a once over, otherwise your stint in front of the stumps will be very short lived. You see, if you jump straight into an England versus Australia match on a high difficulty setting it's likely your pathetic attempts at spinners will get knocked for six. Just like its real-life counterpart, this is a game of finesse so ham-fisted sloggers don't stand a chance. Plus, in addition to teaching you the basics, the tutorial also covers more advanced tactics like bowling a Yorker, 'dancing down the crease' or the somewhat ominous-sounding 'corridor of uncertainity'. Confusing stuff, especially for beginners, but Brian Lara does a good job of making it easy to understand.   After going through the tutorial you're ready to hit the pitch and start batting, bowling and fielding. The last Brian Lara International Cricket was heralded as one of the most realistic cricket sims around and Codemasters has very wisely adopted a 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' policy with the majority of this game, making only minor improvements here and there - the main one being the inclusion of licensed teams players. In that respect Brian Lara 2007 certainly won't revolutionise the cricket genre, but it's certainly a natural step forward from Codemasters's previous effort.   What the game does do extremely well is translate the potentially tricky shots, bowls and quick throws of real-life cricket to just a few buttons on the 360 pad. Beginners playing a knockabout against one of the weaker teams could potentially get away with only batting ground strokes, bowlingstraight balls or making simple catches out on the field. Also, in matches against easier teams, the opponent AI is particularly forgiving so fielders regularly drop catches and it's possible to bowl the same ball to the same place and get a wicket each time.     However, Codemasters hasn't dumbed things down too much and, as we've said previously, this is still a game of finesse. Therefore, while pressing one button will score a few cheap wickets or cheeky fours, it won't win the World Cup. Instead players must use spin shots when bowling or move along the crease when batting, to get in position ready for a mighty whack to the boundary. Rather than only pressing A at every available opportunity then, players must mix it up a little, adding some movement on a bowl or striking the ball high to hopefully score a six.   What's more, additional layers of depth become apparent as a player gets more experienced, although repeat visits to the tutorials may be required to master everything, so you're ready prepared enough to beat the likes of Pakistan or Australia on the harder difficulty settings.   Something that certainly sees you going back to the practice nets is getting the bowling spot on. Unlike the batting, which is relatively easy to grasp, bowling is a much trickier beast. This is because you have to master the styles of both fast bowlers and slower spinners. The differences between the two styles are immediately noticeable and shots that work well for fast bowlers like Freddie Flintoff (when he's not being rescued from a pedalo at four in the morning) will get thumped to the boundary when thrown by a spinner.    As a result, it can be frustrating when a killer bowl that worked well in one over just keeps get blasted for six in another. Of course, it isn't the game's fault that spinning and speed are so different - it's something that's present in the real-life sport too. To really master the bowling you must spend a lot of time practicing different placements, speeds and ball movements in the training mode, then use them effectively in test matches. Although the realism of bowling is pulled off exceptionally well, it would have been better if it were slightly more accessible for players who don't want to spend hours practicing.     Pardon the pun, but when it comes to fielding however Codemasters has dropped the ball. Although the process of quickly swapping the positions of fielders on the fly to try and defend boundary shots is executed very well, thanks to a handy fielder radar that shows their positions, one other element falls short. When a potential catch flies towards a fielder, a special timing bar suddenly appears in the middle of the screen. To catch the ball your press the button when the bar reaches the centre. The problem is it's extremely quick and by the time you've realised there's a catch coming your way, the bar has been and gone, the ball lying forlornly at your feet.   It's a shame that catching is overly tricky because the fielding, on a whole, feels a lot better in comparison to the previous Lara title. This is partly because you have more control and now fielders can run back to either end of the crease to run someone out by hitting the stumps with a well-timed, instead of having throwing it to the wicket keeper each time.     Overall, Brian Lara International Cricket 2007 puts in an impressive innings. It's an accurate recreation of the sport, with decent, realistic physics and a great deal of depth in terms of tactics and strokes to play.   However, aside from the basics of the game - batting, bowling and fielding - Codemasters falls short of the target. Take the so-called next-generation graphics for example: when the camera is pulled back players look great and the animation is fluid, but up close it's not quite so rosy. Players look too rigid and look more like mannequins than world class sportsmen, while the umpires - with their stick-thin, bendy bodies and oversized heads - look like Posh Spice in fancy dress.   The sound effects too are hit and miss. Striking the ball well is met with a satisfying crack of leather on willow, but the crowd noises - especially the guy that keeps shouting 'wooooooooo' after every ball - is like a jovial drill hammering into your brain.   There's not a lot to do in the game apart from play cricket either. While that may sound like an odd criticism, a lot of other sports games offer something different, like the mini-game challenges in Virtua Tennis and the scenario mode in UEFA Champions League. There's nothing like that here - only the World Cup, the Champion's Trophy 2006 and a selection of custom tests and one-day internationals - and the inclusion of additional challenges to break up the gameplay would've been greatly received.If you're a cricket fan then Brian Lara International Cricket 2007 gives you everything you could possibly wish for. There are two fully licensed tournaments to play through - ICC World Cup 2007 and the Champions Trophy. Plus, there are plenty of familiar international players, although you might not recognise them all because they look a little strange because of to the game's clunky graphics. Having said that, actually playing a game of cricket is enjoyable because there's a lot of depth to the bowling, batting and fielding.However, the package does little to attract non-cricket fans, thanks partly to the fact that some gameplay elements - particularly the bowling - require a lot of practice when most casual players just want to win test matches. With a few more fun cricket-themed features, like mini-games or a challenge mode, this would have been a great sporting achievement. As it is it's more like a county match - great if you're into that kind of thing, but not very interesting for everyone else.", "date": "Mar 16, 2007"}
