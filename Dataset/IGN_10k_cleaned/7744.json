Starwave's Traffic Mayhem -- developed by Gamevil -- is indeed a solid puzzler, but it doesn't quite spin the web of superlative brain-taxers like Tower Bloxx.   Traffic Mayhem offers two play modes: Survival and Career. Career mode pits you against a rival cop, rookie Frank, who is gunning for the same series of promotions as you. To move your way up the ranks and become Chief Officer, you must handle all the traffic madness through a series of intersections. Each intersection has a few lights, and you switch between red and green by pressing the number key associated with the streets facing the intersection. You earn points by keeping the flow of traffic smooth. Work all of the lights to maximize points. If you just leave a string of cars behind a red for a long time, you won't earn as many points when they finally do get to pass through the intersection. But if you let things get too frenzied and switch two opposing greens on at the same, you'll see a collision.   As you earn ranks, the mayhem gets thicker with more cars (that move faster) and other on-road distractions. Turtles cross the street, gumming up the works. You cannot allow the turtles to be creamed by a truck, though. You must work the lights around them, granting safe passage. You must also watch for emergency vehicles that always deserve the right-of-way. If one approaches the intersection, you have to halt traffic and let it through -- but not leave the rest of the cars stalled for too long. Smooth movement is the key to success.   There are a handful of minigames thrown into the mix, such as playing a quick game of memory to offer lost drivers proper directions. The Survival mode is just about managing traffic for as long as possible without getting in too many accidents. It's a good inclusion, but not as compelling as the career mode where you have a series of goals.   Traffic Mayhem, however, feels like it's missing something -- like there should be more going on than just switching off lights in a single intersection at a time. The mechanics work, but don't maintain interest enough support an entire game. It doesn't take too long to work your way up through the ranks. Perhaps adding a mode where you try to divert traffic over to Frank to gum up his intersection, or where you have to monitor several intersections and prioritize traffic jams.  Traffic Mayhem can be a fun puzzle game, but as mentioned, it just didn't hold my interest for very long. Directing traffic is a great concept and I'd love to see it fleshed out a little more. If you're looking for a quirky little puzzle game to try out, Traffic Mayhem isn't a bad download at all. But just don't expect to spend too much time with it -- if your carrier offers it as a subscription, go that route.", "date": "Dec 5, 2006"}
