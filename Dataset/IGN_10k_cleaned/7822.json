Diversity in body type was never as important as in Ice Hockey, Nintendo's 1988 addition to the NES Sports Series. The game was and is a semi-faithful translation of the sport of skates and sticks, presented with the same silly sense of mischievous merriment that Nintendo was so known for in those days. But in those days, it wasn't alone. Ice Hockey faced off against a worthy rival in the 8-bit arena: Blades of Steel. Konami's hockey classic took the ice in December '88, cutting off Nintendo's first-party effort just before the holidays. The competition was on and now 18 years later the debate still rages as to which of the two titles is truly superior.   In Ice Hockey you can build your team with any combination of those three available physiques. Skinnies are the fastest, and a good choice to send into face-offs, but they don't have the muscle to push over other players. That quality lives in the fats, beefy and brutish burly-men that throw their weight around and let fly the game's most powerful slapshots. Normals walk the line between the two, offering a balance of acceleration and aggression.           All three are capable of losing their tempers, though, and getting entangled into an on-ice fracas against the opposition. Other hockey games, Blades among them, shifted the view to a zoomed-in Street Fighter perspective to watch two players come to blows. In Ice Hockey, it's a free-for-all. All of the non-goalies on either side jump into a massive pile, and you've got to button-mash your way to success as men get tossed from the cluster, dust them off, and then jump right back in Warner Bros. style.   Ice Hockey isn't the deepest or most accurate simulation of its sport. It's only got five players on each side, for example, where real hockey has six. And its other options are limited, too -- like NES Soccer, it offers only a handful of teams to choose from, each of which is simply a statistically equivalent palette swap of the one before it, and the length of each period is able to be set to one of three denominations of accelerated in-game time. But Ice Hockey has something Soccer didn't: fun. Its fun factor is indescribably but inarguably better. It may be the little touches like letting you select your own combination of variably bodied men. It may be the long-lived rivalry with Blades of Steel. It may be the killer Zamboni show that plays between the 2nd and 3rd periods, but whatever it is, it's there. Ice Hockey is the most solidly executed and consistently enjoyable game in Nintendo's early NES Sports Series.Were you an Icer in the '80s, or was yours a heart of Steel? My advice?
