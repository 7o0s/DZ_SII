Not so much in the sense of having to dive headfirst into a twelve-step program (yet, anyway), but at the end of the day I'd much rather be half-drunk and flush with a paycheck in Vegas than watching reruns on the boob tube, even if boobs themselves are involved. There's just something so wrong and yet so right about the lights, smells, perversity, greed, and overt chicaneries of Sin City that just fits me like a glove. I guess that's why I got flipped Vega$ Tycoon, the new tycoon-style city builder from the folks who brought us Monopoly Tycoon.  The premise is simple enough and not all that novel: create a bustling hotel/casino empire from the ground up, literally. What separates Vega$ Tycoon from other games in the same genre (Konami's Casino, Inc specifically) is the amount of control you have of the environments plus the massive database of objects to place and manage.  Sprinkle in some solid sound design and superb graphics and the party is well underway.  There is the obligatory training level which you can frankly skip as much of the game's controls are fairly intuitive. There are ten main scenarios to tackle, the completion of each one unlocking the next. You start with a completely bare lot with a variety of objectives that you can pretty much keep checking off a list. As the scenarios deepen, the objectives become more difficult, sometimes to the point of frustration. In any one objective you might be trying to attract more visitors or make more money than your virtual competitor, or figure out ways to capitalize on the visit from a whale (high-roller or celebrity). At any point after you've completed a scenario, you can go back and do it again if you like.   After a period of building on a bare lot, you then shift gears a bit and focus on maintenance, personnel issues, attracting visitors and the continual tweaking of your lot and/or casino. Of key value in your experience is the ~filters~ tab. It's all about the feng shui placements. Filters show you nine key characteristics and whether they are having a good influence or a bad one on your game. Denoted by glowing areas, with red bad and green good, filters include noise, smell, beauty, calming, rubbish, host coverage, pitboss coverage, security coverage, and entertainment. If any of the above are red, you're not optimizing your casino. A high-roller won't sit down and gamble if a stinky trash bin is nearby and a relaxing couch near a loud bar will go unused because of the noise. There's almost an entire sub-game revolving around making sure your filters are optimized.    You take your cues about what people are looking for by little thought bubbles floating above them. Some are looking for booze, others for sleep, and still more for gambling, food and entertainment. It's key to quickly recognize the 13 different moods and how to influence them so you can quickly respond to trends and whales.  I suppose it would be too easy a game if you could just remove something that wasn't working so the designers decided to penalize you 50% of the purchase price for something you want to get rid of. While I can appreciate the reasoning behind such a penalty, I often found myself wishing it wasn't in effect, especially during objectives where money played a huge factor. So here you are with negative cashflow, then you realize your bank of progressive slot machines that you plunked down $1200 for is getting in the way of the new bar you want to build. Solution? Get rid of them, but take a $600 hit. Not good.  Since I'm the type of person who used to love downloading complete SimCity cities, just to burn them all to the ground or have an alien destroy them (come on, looking back you have to admit that was kind of silly), my favorite part of the game is clearly Sandbox mode. Here you can give yourself up to $10 million, dictate the population, the amount of events and disasters, and unlock all of the building tools. The goal? There is none, really. You can just run the game, tweaking and razing, hiring and firing, buying and selling to your little heart's content. It saps a little bit of the fun of having objective-based gameplay, but when you need a break from the pressure of the clock or just want to see what works, here you have 12 different Sandbox scenarios to chose from.  The graphical content is gorgeously rendered. Any game using Las Vegas as the fulcrum for the setting had better be flashy and glitzy and colorful. Vega$ Tycoon delivers. The level of detail among the people (your guests) and textures is awesome, especially considering how robust the zoom feature is. You can literally go from a multi-neighborhood sky view all the way down to a single paving stone just by using your mouse's wheel. The game revolves around a 24-hour clock so if you're bored or just naturally spacey you can stare at the shadows growing longer when day turns into night. As night comes, you can actually watch the city come alive with lights. Very cool. A lot of work went into the lighting and shadows and the payoff is, not to beat a dead horse, a royal flush.  If you ever find yourself alone in a quiet house and need to fill the room with, well, the sounds of a casino, this one should be your reference standard. The nuances and level of detail in crafting the both the outside world and interior of the casino is very well done. Whether it's the clinking of the machines, the rush of a fountain, or the shouts of glee or anger of the patrons in your world, rest assured that it is staged expertly.  The background music also works well, nice and vegas-y mellow most of the time.  All in all, a pretty fun and complex tycoon experience. Vega$ Tycoon has solid graphics, dead-on sound design, and enough variability in the objectives and options to keep interest levels high for most fans of the genre. Additional care might have been shown in the penalty for razing a structure or placement, but the awesome ~sandbox mode~ more than makes up for any grumbling you may have. With more detail and options than any of its competitors, Vega$ Tycoon is the de facto standard for casino tycooning.", "date": "Feb 25, 2004"}
