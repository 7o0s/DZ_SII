From the inverted thrills of the ~Big Bad Wolf~ to the creaky wooden terror of the ~Comet,~ I couldn't get enough coasterage. I'd draw pictures of roller coasters that could never be built, with multiple intersecting loops, impossible corkscrews, and stretches of track that were completely upside-down. Though I ignored my urges to become a professional roller coaster designer in favor of becoming a freelance game-playing weasel, my love for the adrenaline rush was awakened once more with the appearance of the Jet Coaster Dream.  Here's the set-up: some old Japanese guy wants you to build roller coasters for an amusement park. Your job is to progress through the game's five levels, making bigger, faster, and more outrageous coasters. If the public likes your speed demon, you move on to the next level of coaster, and are given less restrictions in terms of what you can build. After creating the final coaster, the little Japanese guy comes out, congratulates you, and the credits roll.  Okay, so it's not much of a game. But as a construction kit, Jet Coaster Dream absolutely rocks. I wasted so much time creating coasters in this game, even my copy of Virtual On Oratorio Tangram and matching twinsticks began gathering dust (until Brandon had to smack me around, anyway). Yes, it's that good.  The construction kit system gives you an interface that's similar to SoftImage or 3D Studio MAX. There are four views from the main screen, showing the track's-eye perspective, along with top, side, and front views of your coaster. You work with one piece at a time, using the D-pad to control angle, tilt, and slope of the track.. Pressing A lays the track down, and moves on to the next piece. You can hit B to fix previously created segments, or delete all of the segments after a certain piece. And the options menu lets you insert readymade loops or corkscrews, which you can twist into your own vomit-inducing creations. Hitting Y swaps into a full-screen wire-frame mode, where you can use the analog pad to rotate the whole coaster around for a birds-eye view. This is a good way to spot problems  if track pieces intersect with each other (or the boundaries of the coaster), the track piece turns yellow, and you won't be able to do a test run.  Though you can get pretty crazy with your designs, neglecting to properly bank a curve can result in your train de-railing, throwing all of the riders to their untimely deaths. This is a bad thing, and you usually have to go back and make some adjustments to keep things safe.  Once you've looped the track back to the station, you can hop into the front seat of the coaster and try it out for yourself. This is obviously the game's big payoff, as you're whipped through your own speed demon at a rock-solid 60fps. Everything just feels right, from the sensation of speed to the screams of the riders as you hit the giant drops. Nothing beats a half-mile, 180kph dive into six consecutive loops, followed by corkscrews through a maze of track that would be structurally impossible to build in real life. Just bear in mind that the amount of thrill is proportional to the size of your TV  readers with projection televisions should get this game immediately, while those with old General Electric 12-inchers may want to think twice.  When (and if) the test run is completed, a scoring sheet pops up. It ranks you based on the number of people who were knocked unconscious or threw up afterwards (no, I'm not making this up), then tabulates your coaster's feasibility based on top speeds and G-forces. If you pass the test, give yourself a pat on the back  it's time to move on to the next coaster.  So are there any major down-sides to Jet Coaster Dream? You're limited to around 240 pieces of track, which is probably a technical issue more than anything else  when you get over 200 segments on screen, the frame rate starts chugging (though the actual game is always locked at 60fps). The save games are also pretty massive, and you can fit five coasters in around 70 blocks on your VMS. The only real feature that's missing is the ability to look around as you're riding the coaster  in real life, I love locking my head to the left or right as I take a loop, and it would have added a good bit of immersion to the game. At least there are a few different camera angles to view your coaster run from. And I can think of some suggestions for a sequel  how about inverted coasters, or dual, racing coasters?  But, hell, it's only thirty bucks  and rather amazingly, the game's design, programming, and graphics were done by one guy, a Mr. Hirofumi Hattori. We haven't seen such a notable one-man feat since the late 1980s, and if I ever run into this guy, I'm buying him a Sapporo.  All in all, Jet Coaster Dream kicks more ass and offers a bigger rush than even the Batman ride at Six Flags Great Adventure. If you ever drew pictures of coasters as a kid (or you still do), you need to import this game.  -- Colin ~Coaster~ Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 15, 1999"}
