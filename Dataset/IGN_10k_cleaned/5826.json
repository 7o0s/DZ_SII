Almost entirely depleted of its spirit stone supply and up to its ears with new technologies and job classes, the kingdoms of Ragnoth, Halshinne, Adenade, and Epistia are no longer torn by racial tensions -- just uncertainty. Where the world goes from here following the near-disaster of half a decade ago nobody knows, but luckily, that's where you come in. As an aspiring exorcist turned hunter named Edda, you'll have to discover what it is that fate plans next with Cattle Call's latest role-player, Arc the Lad: End of Darkness.   Of course, it goes without saying that players who made it through 2003's Twilight of the Spirits are in for feelings of dj vu, as End of Darkness has gone back to reuse many of the same environments, musical tracks, enemies, and characters for this version just as Square Enix did with Final Fantasy X-2. In another parallel with that game, Cattle Call has also completely revamped Arc the Lad's battle system by moving away from its pseudo turn-based combat and opting for the more frenzied action-oriented stuff instead. When coupled with the game's brand new mission-based structure, End of Darkness definitely comes across as a completely different experience compared to the last adventure. Yes friends, regardless of how many cities or enemies we may have seen before, this is definitely a whole new ball game.   For some (including me), this directional change won't necessarily be a welcome one. After all, Twilight of the Spirits' two best features were its compelling storyline and interesting turn-based combat system. Unfortunately the plot twists this time around aren't anywhere near as strong as they were before and its somewhat generic theme never truly picks up. It is, however, full of references to the previous titles in the series and has a handful of extremely likeable characters like Edda and Kirika that make wading through its disjointed setup a lot more tolerable. It was also nice to see how the people we grew so attached to in the last game turned out after the credits rolled, but some of the choices here leave a lot to be desired (Maru is arranged to marry his first cousin Foh? How is that possible?).   These dragons are some of Arc the Lad's cooler enemies. Because of its likeable cast and strong musical support during cutscenes, however, End of Darkness' weaker storyline is a lot easier to take once you've given it a few hours and have committed to finding out how everything is supposed to unfold. In all honesty, the narrative here isn't really that bad at all -- it's just slow as hell for the first two hours or so, but after that picks up into a halfway-decent adventure. The brand new battle system, however, isn't quite as forgivable.   Don't get me wrong, the real-time hack and slash format that Cattle Call has implemented for Arc the Lad isn't terrible, it just doesn't offer a very responsive experience. But you can blame that on slow animations and delayed reaction times. As for the idea itself, it's actually pretty cool: players are given what's known as an ALD gauntlet that they can then equip with specialized upgrade cards to function in different ways. Some can be used as armor, others can be used for special abilities like healing or fire arrows, while the remaining cards boast more specialized ~unique~ abilities. How players decide to upgrade their characters with these cards are important too, as your character's level (known as Hunter Ranks) is tied into the promotion system and what kind of missions he can undertake in the future.   Unfortunately, because of the way that the storyline missions are structured, there's a lot of backtracking and battling that needs to be done to really get anywhere. And as cool as the concept behind the real-time combat may be, the actual execution of this warfare is lacking for two main reasons:   1.) The aforementioned slow response times and deliberate animations force certain weapon combos to finish playing out before your character can recover and retaliate against the almost-guaranteed freebie monster hits he'll receive.   2.) Vastly inconsistent AI routines that see most enemies stand there with almost no aggression at all until you walk right up on them, while others suddenly lash out uncontrollably in huge packs for quick near-death damage.   When these battle problems are coupled with the huge amount of backtracking involved with advancement, Arc the Lad: End of Darkness becomes really repetitive pretty fast. For almost the whole game all you have to do is go from one town to obtain a quest, move to another area to complete it, and then travel back to another city to repeat this process all over again. Between missions, you'll also have the opportunity to rise in rank once you've met certain criteria, and once you have, you can access more complicated versions of the scenarios highlighted above. And when you consider that you're almost always destroying a horde of enemies, escorting some missing guy back to his loved one, or protecting a sacred item of some sort in almost every mission, it doesn't take long to grow a little bored.   Luckily, Arc the Lad's most interesting feature is its ability to go online with up to seven other people for eight-person death matches and alternative co-op play. Granted, other than the PVP skirmishes the online mission structure here is pretty much identical to its offline counterpart. But thanks to the inclusion of USB headset support for voice chat (an exclusive in the American version) and some cool network customization modes, the game's repetitive nature isn't quite as obvious. It's a big help that the game is broadband only too, as lag and other problems typically associated with PS2 online was almost never a problem in its first few days of release. Hopefully, it'll stay this way during its entire networked lifecycle and won't end up like our counterparts in Japan -- whose End of Darkness servers are being shutdown by Sony at the end of this month due to a general lack of interest.   Arc the Lad fans worried that the online feature is the game's only redeemable bonus shouldn't worry, though, as there a couple of other little additions that make playing through Edda's elongated quest a little more entertaining. Save data from Twilight of the Spirits, for example, can be imported into End of Darkness for some cool bonuses that give you an extra advantage from the outset. And while we're on the subject, there are 24 special character cards that can be used to summon personalities from past games to fight along with you in battle (Kharg, Maru, Arc, Elc, and a host of others among them). You can even create new items using synthesis recipes at your local item shop or locate hidden midget buddies that provide secret information and bonus bestiaries for completists.    Arc the Lad: End of Darkness has some good ideas, but ideology and reality are two completely different things. In the real world, a unique upgrade system, online competitive modes, and semi-linear mission structure can't shine the way they're supposed to if they're supplemented by poor AI, repetitive progression, and a storyline that's nowhere near as powerful as its predecessor. Hardcore RPG fans might want to check this out just to see what it's made of, but if you're looking for a more complete Arc the Lad experience, all four previous games are much better alternatives.", "date": "Jun 16, 2005"}
