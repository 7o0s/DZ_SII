Weapons include missiles, shields, hammers and more. Four-player versus modes. Up to eight players can play using ~pad share.~GameplayBased on the popular toy car series, this highly addictive multiplayer racer takes gamers back to those blissful days of playing with toy cars in their grandparents' backyard -- only this time, the toy cars are armed with deadly hammers, missiles, and mechanical arms. Better even, sitting on your trusty couch and staring at a big-screen TV should deliver all the fun of the real thing, minus the ants in your pants and the presumably healthy dose of fresh air.Instead of going for the full 3D treatment like most racing games, Micro Machines is presented from an overhead view, just like the NES classic. While the game has been improved here and there, gameplay is largely identical to the PlayStation version. Press A to accelerate, B to brake, jump with R, honk with Z or use a weapon -- but instead of having to steer your cars with the digital pad, the N64 version offers excellent analog control via the stick. The D-Pad can also be used, of course.Races take place in a variety of everyday life settings: A backyard with a sleeping dog, a lily pond with frogs, an elementary school desk, a pool table, a beach, a dinner table, and even a chemist's lab with all kinds of mysterious chemicals. The vehicles you can select are as fun as the environments, ranging from tanks, over race cars and swamp boats down to the obligatory ice cream trucks. There are a whopping 32 different ones in total.Micro Machines features a wealth of modes: Driving School: Learn the basics of control. Head to Head: You versus a computer controlled opponent on a group of tracks. Challenge: Three lap races against four computer-controlled drones. Finish each race in the top two and you progress to the next group of tracks. Pick up power-ups to take out your opponents and win a ~Prize Car.~ Time Trial Challenge: A race against the clock on a group of tracks. Time Trial Single Race: As the name implies, you race on one track only.But one of the strongest features of the Micro Machines series has always been the multiplayer versus races. Since the action is viewed from an overhead view, Codemasters opted against using a smaller split screen for each player -- everything is one screen. The play mechanics in Micro Machines are as follows: Each player who is left behind (ie exits the screen) drops out of the race. When only one racer is left,the action stops, the cars are lined up at the spot where the leading racer was, and the winner gets one point. The player with the most points wins.Since the N64 has a built-in four controller slots, the choice of a four-player mode was a natural one -- but Codemasters is actually taking things a little further. By having two players share one controller (D-Pad for the first player, C-Buttons up-side down for the second), up to eight players can compete at the same time in the game's ~Pad Share~ party mode. It's actually works better than it sounds.The modes: Multiplayer Single Race: Up to eight racers compete on one course. The last remaining driver gets a point. Tournament: Select a group of courses and take on your friends. Teams Mode: You can choose to gang up. Four players can be split into two teams, with each player controlling one vehicle for their team. Six players can form three teams, and so on. Party Play Mode: Players compete consecutively for the best time. There are several sub-modes, including Time Trial Tournament, Knockout, Player Share, and Keepsies. Stats Mode: Find out how your character has performed during their gameplaying lifetime. Sub-modes include Test Drive, Player Records, Time Trial Stats, and more.To make things short: We love this game and it's never difficult to get together at least four players to race a few tracks. There will definitely be some players out there who can't stand the fact that the action is interrupted every time you leave the other players behind, but we actually don't mind. It gives us time to brag about our win and take a sip of [your drink here].We have, however, a few quibbles with the track AI. Sometimes, players who accidentally get knocked off the track will score a win despite the fact that the other players are ahead. Like in the PSX version, there are a few such spots in the game and it can be a little annoying at times to get deprived of a win because of a location glitch. Other than that, this is one of the most addicting and fun racing games out there. Try playing it on the maximum speed setting -- and we guarantee you will go insane.GraphicsDespite its fixed viewpoint, the graphics in Micro Machines are 3D polygonal and actually surprise with a few exciting effects. While they're hardly revolutionary, the graphics are colorful and the environments are well put together with amusing roadside details (and without any of the texture jittering found in the PSX version). Players will spot cereal boxes, skid through milk, get stuck in honey patches, jump over pool balls, race around a dog, disappear in high grass, cause ripples in a pond, and light up the environment when turning into a fire ball. We suggest keeping an eye open for some of the funny hidden stuff, such as the periodic table, the little scribbles on the school tables and the titles on books or boxes.The textures aren't quite as nice as in the PSX version due to the N64's miniscule texture cache, but the framerate is solid and there are tons of neat little smoke effects and the like that make the N64 version look a tad better. Instead of having the prerendered player animations, Codemasters rendered the characters in realtime. Well, they're still stereotypical and annoying, but thanks to the cartridge's speed, they're over quicker.SoundForget the music. Except for the title theme and the occasional jingle, there isn't much here anyway -- but the sound effects are surprisingly well done. Sadly, some of the background stuff from the PSX version isn't here (such as the restaurant ambience, etc), but all the cars have different engine sounds and the impact noises differ depending on what you hit. Don't miss out on using the strategically well-placed ~whoopee cushion~ against your buddies. Maybe it's just us, but a well-placed fart noise while everyone's concentrating on winning has never failed to cause sudden crashes.Peripheral SupportBoth the Controller and Rumble Paks are supported. Game saves take up eight pages on the Controller Pak and the rumble is intelligently used to let players know that they're going over bumpy terrain that could slow them down.Micro Machines is one of those games that doesn't look like much, but turns out to be so addictive, you'll invite people over just to play it. It's all about multiplayer racing -- and variety. With 48 tracks and 32 vehicles, this game is loaded and beckons to be played over and over again. Powersliding around corners with four players is really where it's at and there is nothing better than honking your tiny racer like crazy while trying to push your opponents off a table onto the deadly carpet (if you don't think a carpet can be deadly, I invite you all to pay a visit to Matt's house). So rush out and grab a copy of this game. One in four people needs it.", "date": "Mar 25, 1999"}
