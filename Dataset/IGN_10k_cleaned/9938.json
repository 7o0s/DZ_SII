In a very real way, Bizarre Creations' puzzle-shooter Geometry Wars is responsible for this resurgence (though, some might argue that titles like Rez and Lumines forged the way), catching the public eye with its inclusion in various forms in the Project Gotham Racing series on Xbox 360 and as a standalone arcade title on Xbox Live Arcade. Now the series has landed on Wii in Australia  admittedly months behind the US release.    Geometry Wars Galaxies continues the minimalist approach with an admittedly pretty leap onto the Wii  but the real drawcard isn't the wireframe neon or explosive particle effects and waveform  but the lasting and addictive gameplay, made deeper and more diverse in its transition from console to console. Of course, this is coming from a game that was originally free, then sold for a very minimal price as a download. Now, it has a much higher price-tag  but with a new format in addition to the original game and a host of extras.    For those not versed, Geometry Wars is an arcade shooter of the purest nature. You propel your little craft around the screen, now joined by an upgradeable drone (see below), as you try to take out glowing geometric enemies as just stay alive for as long as your synapses will allow.     The 'Galaxies' moniker is appropriate on two levels. Kuju Entertainment, the developer of this version, have taken the already pseudo-space setting (that's the first level, for those paying attention) and given it a galaxy hub setting, something of a progressive and open structure for guiding you through the game. You start off initially in a training solar system where you can cut your teeth on a handful of slower-paced and fairly plain encounters, vying for points as you try and earn gold, silver or bronze medals and stay alive as long as possible.   Geoms are the key to progressing through the campaign. Every enemy you blast apart yields a geom of between one and ten points in value, which are accumulated and multiplied to give you a total points balance. You can use this towards unlocking new planets and solar systems of increasing complexity and difficulty. While initial stages might only challenge you with four or five different enemy types across the whole scenario, by opening up some of the more expensive levels, the challenge is ramped up almost immediately, and you'll face a dozen or so different enemies and obstacles along the way. All of these affect the play of each level like rules added to a game. Some rush towards you, requiring immediate attention; some drift en masse, cluttering corners and eating into your space. Others still are large, branching off into swarms, leaving waveform ripples in their wake. Gravity wells, mine layers and wormholes modify the experience further, while some maps restrict your movement through moving walls, sweeping fields of UFOs and repeating patterns of attacks that surround you on all sides.   It's a purist shooter fans' wet dream  challenging with a gradual curve, progression that is measurable and tangible, and best of all, a range of control options. One of the most critical factors that tip the scales in Geometry Wars Galaxies' favour are these available control styles, taking advantage of the Wii remote and nunchuk in tandem, or the Classic controller, with its more traditional dual analogue stick configuration, putting it squarely back in the realm of the original Xbox 360 Retro Evolved version.   Totally having an acid flashback right now.  The Battle Drone another new addition to the gameplay mix, is a tiny helper-drone that trails behind you initially, but can eventually be taught new actions determined by different unlockable preferences. There are eight different behaviours eventually at your disposal, selectable before you head into a stage. In addition to more straightforward Attack, Defend and Collect options, we found Bait and Sweep to be the most useful. Bait sends out a signal that attracts attacking shape into a direction away from you, allowing you to zip around to the side and lay waste to them. Sweep sends the drone out in a fanning wave around the central ship, smashing enemies as it moves, which is obviously handy the deeper into the fray things dissolve.    The Drone's abilities are upgradeable and an interesting inclusion. It doesn't make a huge difference at the start of the game, since it's mostly limited to the most simplistic behaviours, but you'll be thankful for it later in the game.   Map and enemy factor heavily into making the Wii version worth the price of admission. There are size and speed variations on a number of shapes, starting with stationary Grunts, Wanderers and Weavers to the more complex Spinners that burst into a cloud of normal-sized and eventually tiny Spinners. Mine Layers deposit neon green explosive rounds that can be detonated in a chain by flying over one of the mines. Then there are the Darts, Flippers, Meteors, Snakes Repulsors and a dozen other space-born foes to contend with. There's a lot going on at all times on a playing field that generates these shapes endlessly.   Good luck.  The field itself varies as much as the enemies in them. The colour scheme isn't always neon blue, or even a rectangular mesh of squares; there are octagonal fields of giant squares, red and green lines, zigzagged sawtooth walls, giant scrolling planes and a huge number of combinations. By restricting your movement, adding walls, moving barriers and constant fields of UFOs, meteors and so forth, the game does a lot with very little.   Multiplayer modes are a nifty inclusion, with two players able to go head-to-head or in co-op in the campaign or in challenge modes, where you're stuck in a situation that you need to see through to the end. The addition of online score-tracking is a boon for those with a Wi-Fi connection, though being able to crack the top 10 takes more skill, time, effort and above all patience that we can muster. Finally, DS-to-Wii communication is fantastic, given that you can share a version of the game on your DS via Wi-Fi communication. If you own the portable version, you can unlock a bonus galaxy too  though, the content in the games is virtually identical, so we're not too sure if it's really worthwhile, unless you have the dough to spend.   Our issues with Geometry Wars Galaxies are few. A cluttered menu system consisting of rotating planets on a circular plane makes navigating between them a pain, since these celestial bodies constantly revolve. To make matters, worse, for some strange reason you can only move the menu with the Wii remote's D-pad, even though the Nunchuk is required for play. Strange. It's also a little too easy at times, since linking up score-multipliers quickly in some of the levels can raise your score into the high tens of millions in a matter of minutes.  If you've already bought any version before this and really need your fix, then Galaxies is for you. On the other hand, the extras don't quite justify the full price tag unless you're already an established fan, so it's kind of a catch 22 of sorts. It's not visually too impressive, but that's hardly the point either. The value of the game is really dependent on your passion and commitment.", "date": "Feb 1, 2008"}
