It's only available in Japan right now, but there's absolutely no reason why this cart shouldn't make it across the ocean. We could simplify it as a kind of Virtual On for kids, but that suggests that older gamers won't get anything out of this Noise developed game. Custom Robo has some of the tightest control we've seen in any N64 game, a fast steady framerate and as much button mashing fun as the superfun All Star Smash Brothers.   It's a game intended for a Japanese audience, where little boys collecting, customizing and battling their toys and pets makes for huge fun, so there are many Pokemon-like elements in CR. In the story mode, you of course are a young boy that likes to play with his customizable robot action figure against other kids in the area. You roam from place to place picking fights, er, making friends with other Custom Robo fans and battling it out in dedicated arenas. The part of the game where you're not actually fighting robots has you roaming from place to place advancing the story in an isometric point of view that will remind some of Harvest Moon.   It must be said here, that we don't understand nearly enough Japanese to know all that was being said in the dialogue boxes. But we do know that we could simply A-button our way through all of the talking, answer ~Yes~ every time it popped up and we got very deep into Custom Robo. Just something to keep in mind in case Nintendo concocts some reason to not bring this game to America and Europe. There's no reason to be intimidated by the Japanese language in this case.  The actual battles are the tasty bread, butter and jelly of Custom Robo. Since your robots are actually little cubes that transform into robot warriors, a fight starts off with you launching your cube into your favorite part of the arena. Before your cube transforms, though, it will show a particular icon on top that corresponds to your robot's weapons and equipment. He'll get a little power-up on that piece of equipment for that battle round.  Once your guy is transformed, however, the fun really begins. Your robot has four customizable weapons systems that you can re-configure in what ever combination you can come up with before each battle. You get a pistol type weapon on one arm, a missile type weapon on the other, guided rocket weapons on the back/shoulders and a pair of boots. Each character has a specific charge attack where they'll shoulder block or drop kick the opponent for major damage, but this is not customizable. There are only four different areas to work with but you will unlock all kinds of weapons during the course of the story mode.   There are enough of each individual kind of weapon to give players thousands of possible configurations. The weapons are based loosely on boyhood themes like frogs, hornets, beetles and other critters kids love to play with. So for example, if you pick up a shark weapon, two shark shaped missiles will dart out of your robo's back, lurk for a minute and then dart right at the target. The same goes for the hornet pistol that shoots five giant hornets that home in on a target, but takes forever to reload. This boyhood motif is repeated throughout the game and its weapons system and it's actually a very important hook in the game.  Just because you unlock a cool new weapon that the enemy was just pummeling you with, that doesn't mean you're an instant badass. You have to learn to incorporate that weapon into your fighting style -- you will have to develop one -- and match it up with the other weapons in your arsenal. You have to make your robot the most effective fighting machine you can. Furthermore, as you progress in the game, different enemies will pose different challenges. You'll have to find the right weapons package to get the job done.   As you unlock more stuff, you'll realize that you have too much firepower at your disposal. There is some repetition of function among weapons, but there are multiple upgrades and equivalents to specific types of weapons. For example, there are a few pistol weapons that are slow in reloading yet extremely powerful. As you progress further in the game opening up new pistols, the reload time on newer weapons remains slow, but the shot itself gets faster and faster.   You basically win the weapons of the characters you defeat, but you don't get them right away. You have to travel to one of several parts generators to pick them up. This gets to be a problem if on your way to pick up your new gear, someone decides to challenge you. Chances are you'll know just how cool that new gun or rocket launcher is, because you will have just been getting smoked with it.  All of these strategy elements are what makes Custom Robo one of the most addicting games out there. It's disguised in a Pokemon-like world of cutesiness, but there's a lot to think about before going into battle. It's like a MechWarrior game with bright colors.  The control is excellent in CR and it absolutely has to be. Your robo, thanks to those customizable boots, can jump and rocket hop around using the R button and, like all of that double jumping from Smash Brothers, this can be a key to victory. Similarly, your rocket launchers, pistols and missiles all have set firing patterns that you will have to learn to be effective. Of course, Custom Robo will quickly breakdown into a button mashing, finger blistering sweatfest, but Noise still wants you to make use of the game as it was meant to be played. Quickly and efficiently.  Take all of the good stuff mentioned above and replace the AI with human control and you'll understand how fun the two player can be. It's like nothing else on the system. When you're going against your buddies, with every unlocked weapon available, you get all of the high energy and action of a fighter, but in a game that looks and feels very unique.  The look of the game is very basic. There's nothing special to look at here, but as fast as the action is in Custom Robo, there's not much time to appreciate much beauty. Even on the Dreamcast Virtual On broke down into angular shapes shooting bits of light at each other when the pace picked up. The graphics are forgivable in this case because Custom Robo's not a game created for its looks.  This game also has some of the most understated and effective camera movements of any N64 game. Even when you're on the other side of some structure you'll always know where each character is and what is going on. The camera just pans and zooms and dips effortlessly to give you the closest possible angle on the action. Very well done.  The sound boils down to weird techno-anime music and exaggerated battle sound effects. There's no voice and so the entire story is conveyed through dialogue boxes that can seem to run on forever. The weapons have distinct firing and detonation noises and they're enough to get the job done. When I first saw a clip of Custom Robo running all I could wonder was ~what in the hell is going on in that game?!~ The frantic action and typical Nintendo look can really be a turn off if you don't give it a chance. All it took was a couple of missile launches here and a point blank shotgun blast there and I was completely hooked. The story mode is extremely fun and you'll rack up victories and new equipment rather easily at first, but the opponents and arenas get very tough all of a sudden and you will notice the difference. I can't think of a game with a better two-player-only battle game modes.This sudden jump in difficulty is another reason why CR is so addicting. You're thinking to yourself ~I've just been kicking this game's robotic hide for 12 matches straight! Surely I can beat this green haired girl with bug eyes and her pink robot!~ This game takes the appealing elements of Pokemon, fighting games and sci-fiction and blends them together into one enjoyable gaming experience on the N64. This is the best Japan-only N64 game that I know of.", "date": "Apr 5, 2000"}
