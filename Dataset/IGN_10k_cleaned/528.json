There were no action figures to sell, and no videogames to promote. The cartoons where just entertaining and worth waking up at 6 am in the morning for.    One of these cartoons was The Smurfs. Started as a comic strip in Belgium by Peyo, the series was born after the director of NBC saw how much his daughter loved a Smurf doll sitting in a store window.  Not too long after that, the animated series was born, and the rest is history.   The Smurfs went on to become a hit in all corners of the world. The series has been translated into well over 30 languages, and even spawned a movie. Now, the little blue guys who are three apples high make their first appearance on the PlayStation.   Story & Gameplay The Smurfs is actually split into two separate ~games.~ The first is aimed for children ages four through seven. You get to control Hefty Smurf in a quest to keep Baby Smurf happy.  By running through seven very simple side scrolling levels, you collect bottles of milk and toy rattles to use on a Baby Smurf that acts like a virtual pet.  As your progress through each level, you are instructed on how to perform various tasks such as jumping, and talking with other character.   When you go to the Baby Smurf screen, each of the four main buttons on the controller will give him a different item. When the item that he wants appears above his head, you press the correct button, and Baby Smurf will be given the item. A stack of blocks to the side of him gauges his happiness, the lighter the color, the happier he is. Even though this small portion if the game is aimed for younger children, it is nice to play through in order to familiarize yourself with the controls.   The next part of the game is the real meat and potatoes. Once again you control Hefty Smurf in a side-scrolling action game with 3D graphics, but this time he must save the entire Smurf race from yet another scheme hatched by that crafty villain, Gargamel. In this mode, you run and jump through ten levels of an extremely average platformer. There is literally nothing here that you haven't seen done before (or better) in another game. For example, there are fans that will make you hover, just as in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. You run and jump your way through the levels while collecting candy (100 will score you an extra life), and crescent moon icons. If you collect thirty of those, you get to go on a date with Smurfette! Watch while I restrain myself. If you have never played a different platformer in your life, you may enjoy it, but there are other platformers on the system aimed toward the same age groups that offer more innovation (the sleeper Klonoa comes to mind).   Graphics The Smurfs features graphics that are actually not too bad. The majority of the 3D environments feature mostly flat shaded characters (only a couple enemies are actually textured) and objects on top of fully textured backgrounds. Characters are animated very well, especially the ~Grogs~ who are one of the main adversaries that you will face. One problem with the graphics, however, is that in some levels the frame rate can get pretty choppy. At times it is playable, while at others it gets to a point where it is painful to watch the action.  The game itself is presented very well. Throughout the game there are fully animated scenes used to set up the story. These are about the same quality as the original Saturday morning cartoon, but the voice actors are different than in the American version of the series.   Sound Along with the different voices, the music is just not right. Throughout the game you never hear the Smurf's theme song. This is as if someone made a Star Wars game without the famous theme, or a Indiana Jones game without the classic ~Raider's March.~   As for the sound effects, nothing really stands out. The character voices in the game are pretty muffled, which causes what they have to tell you hard to make out. I was a fan of The Smurfs back in the day. I remember getting up early in the morning to watch the show every Saturday, and I occasionally catch the reruns on the Cartoon Network. With that in mind, I had high hopes for a Smurf game on the PlayStation. What we got was a slightly above average platformer that is a good rental at most. Maybe someday we will finally get a good Smurf game that offers something that every other platformer does not.", "date": "Dec 14, 1999"}
