Namely; personality, varied and fun games, and a somewhat believable pretext. Honestly, sight training? Testing my 'Eye Age'? That makes no sense.   It's not that training your eyes in the areas of dynamic visual acuity, eye movement, peripheral vision, momentary vision and hand-eye coordination is necessarily such a bad idea  it is, after all, a fundamental part of being a professional athlete, and keen eyesight (a.k.a. spotting raccoons by the side of the road) is a good thing to have, it's just that doing it on the DS seems a bit of a leap. A game like Brain Training works because exercises like maths or playing a tune on a piano can very easily be transposed to a handheld console, and with touch screen functionality the whole thing becomes very intuitive. Looking at stuff, and honing the way you look at stuff, on the other hand, is something that we're inclined to think should remain as a real world pursuit, and little in our week with this title has convinced us otherwise.   Of course, the efficacy of any of the titles in this genre is debatable, so it's perhaps more important to simply look at how enjoyable the mini-games are, and whether you get a sense of satisfaction from coming back to them day after day. Sadly, about half the mini-games  the games in the Core Training category  are very drab and clinical indeed. They may be based on actual eye tests (at least, they feel like they've been adapted from tests devised by a University science department in the 70s) but that certainly doesn't make them inherently exciting.    A few examples:   Box Track  a.k.a. Grifter's Delight. You'd know this as the game where the shady looking character on the side of the street puts a dice under one of three cups then moves them all around and you have to pick which one has the dice. In this case, the dice is a green circle, and the cups are grey squares. As you'd imagine, the better you do, the faster the grey squares move. Excitement, She Wrote!   Symbol Order  a.k.a. C Senorita. A grid of grey rectangles occupy both screens, with three Cs popping up sequentially in random rectangles. You must spot the directions of the Cs and enter them in in the correct order. Apparently this tests your ability to rapidly shift focus between targets. All I know is that the designers of this game get off on Cs  this is just one of several mini-games starring Cs.   The answer to life, the Universe and everything... is not 43. Close but no cigar.  Middle Match  a.k.a. Glancing A Go Go. This game tests peripheral vision, which I would have assumed would require you to be identifying things on the very periphery of you vision as opposed to less than an inch to the side of the area you're focusing on. Still, in Glancing A Go Go you must pick the area on the periphery that flashes with a C of the same orientation as the one in the middle. 'C' what I mean?   Number Flash  a.k.a. Flasher's Surprise. Spot the numbers that flash on the screen then enter them in. Flasher's Surprise becomes something of a zen pursuit as you move up through the levels - identifying an eight digit number after it has flashed on screen for a half a second is a bit like unfocusing your eyes to solve a Magic Eye puzzle.   Then there's Box Tap, Letter Count, C Count, Circle Spot and a couple of others. Sadly, they're all pretty dull to look at, and while some of them hold a morbid fascination, they're pretty dull to play too. And as mentioned earlier, there's been absolutely no attempt to spice up proceedings with a little Kawashima-esque personality. Instead, post-mini-game dialogue generally consists of the usual praise or utter disappointment when you've slightly improved or slightly declined on your last result, and a tenuous link between the skill you're developing and the world of sports.     Oh, and you'll often (and by 'often', I mean 'every time you play certain games') be given insightful post-mini-game tips. For instance, the advice for Box Track, the game in which you must stay aware of the box with the O underneath, really changed the way I looked at the game: ~In Box Track, you must stay aware of the box with the O.~ Thanks for that. Or how about the advice for Symbol Order, the game where you must accurately spot the direction of the Cs: ~In Symbol Order, make sure to accurately spot the direction of the Cs.~ I guess when these are the only things you need to do in each game, it makes coming up with pointers a little hard.   Thankfully, the Core Training games are only half the package, and the Sports Training mini-games fare considerably better. This is partly due to a more interesting presentation which utilises 3D-ish settings and digitised animations, and partly due to faster gameplay. Table Tennis, for instance, sees you facing off against a digitised opponent and you slide the stylus across the screen to knock the ball back. It's not a proper game of Table Tennis  your opponent will never miss, but it's a challenge to return all 40 shots without missing, especially on hard, when he mixes his shots up a lot more. So yeah, not too bad and not a C in sight.   Baseball is pretty decent too, requiring you to time your swing as the pitcher flings the ball over the plate. Depending on your aim and timing, you can hit anything from a single run grounder to a home run. This is easily the most challenging game, but whether we'll ever be able to focus on the metre on the left (which shows the ball's flight as it approaches the plate) at the same time as the actual action remains to be seen.   It's Boxing, however, which is hands down the best mini-game in the set. The object is simplicity itself - simply hit the trainer's mitts as he opens them to you and slide the stylus occasionally to dodge his punches, but on hard when he's faking you out and requiring lightning fast one-twos it really gets fun. You're also rewarded for hitting the centre of the mitt, both in points and in a meatier sound effect, so this is one of a handful of games that actually have a little more to them than getting something right or wrong.   How 'bout that local sports team?  A couple of the other Sports titles don't fare so well. Volleyball, for instance, sees you spiking the ball at the net, having to time your hit on the ball as it falls down, avoiding the leaping defenders. It's a little counter-intuitive, however, that the gap between the screens isn't accounted for. Instead, the ball moves instantly from one to the other. Perhaps a training mini-game (within the mini-game) to help us adjust may have made sense?    As you'd expect, each mini-game comes in a normal and a hard variety, and your stats for each are tracked over time. Then there's the ability to determine your 'Eye Age' and track that over time too. Apparently an ideal 'Eye Age' (sorry, it really does have to be in inverted commas each time  it's just too silly to take seriously) is 20, and it works in the same way as Brain Training  a sequence of tests that are chosen somewhat randomly (but themed  my theme today? 'Hone You Talents! Strengths Workout') and you can only test your 'Eye Age' once a day.   While the structure may be almost identical to the Brain Training games, there's one crucial difference, and that is that the games in Sight Training can all be beaten. They're all scored out of 100, and you can theoretically get 100 in each. The majority are simply a sequence of right or wrong answers that increase in difficulty without speed taken into account. This is a far cry from Brain Training, where you could theoretically keep eking lower and lower numbers out of, say, Calculations x100, almost indefinitely. While this more binary system means that your results are more quantifiable than the often ethereal numbers Brain Training tagged your performances with, it just isn't as appealing, nor does it have anywhere near the same longevity.  Sight Training really is a pretty bland product. While Dr. Kawashima isnt exactly the most enthralling individual in the world, at least his little interjections and bizarre animations actually helped give the Brain Training games a little personality. Sadly, Sight Training lacks this, along with a number of other things. It really does feel like a game designed to be shoehorned into this new edu-train-ment genre, without regard for the merits of the concept, or the attention to entertainment required to make it work.", "date": "Jan 16, 2008"}
