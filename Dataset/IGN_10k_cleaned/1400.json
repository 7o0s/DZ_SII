Playmates Interactive must've had this in mind when it picked up VMX Racing. However, this mud-splattered motocross title is so beset with problems, it makes it difficult to accept it as the only two-wheeled racer available.  VMX Racing took forever to come out, as developer Studio E kept having to pull it back in and make more adjustments. Apparently they never got it quite right, as the control is incredibly faulty. Navigating on the tight courses is a real chore with the loose steering. Tracks of this type demand tight turning, and it just doesn't work without it. The brakes are too strong, and stop you on a dime when you should just be slowing down.   If control was the game's only fault, it might be passable. However, this is the least of its worries. The graphics are, well, deplorable. It's impossible to tell where you're supposed to go, and when you're racing neck and neck with other bikers, they have a tendency to clip in and out of the screen. Good graphics probably wouldn't have saved the game, but they couldn't have hurt.    To its credit, VMX Racing does have a two-player split-screen mode, but this is too little, too late. Even if you're dying for a motocross game, pass up VMX Racing.", "date": "Jul 26, 1997"}
