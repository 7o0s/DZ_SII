The rebuilt/port of the Dreamcast version will make some racing fans happy. It's a very balanced sim/arcade experience, and if I hadn't played the excellent Dreamcast game, I wouldn't be as disappointed. But, you see, I did play the DC version, and it's a better-looking game. The textures were sharper, the music clearer, fewer artifacts appeared on the road, and unfortunately, there were no aliasing or flicker problems in it, either. The PS2 version, on the other hand, boasts all of these dilemmas, and well, we expect more from the red hot Aussies down at Melbourne House.   It's not like the game sucks. Just the opposite, it's an exhilarating driving experience. It plays exactly like the Dreamcast version: It's fast, provides plenty of challenge, and has all of the extra stuff the Dreamcast version didn't. It's just doesn't look or sound as good. So yeah, if you dig Le Mans racing, then you're sure to love this game. And if you can forgive it for the annoying little problems it presents, then get it. But if you already have the Dreamcast game, don't even bother, your eyes won't forgive you.    Gameplay Le Mans 24 Hours is Infogrames sleek, straight-up racing game that delivers an accurate re-creation of the official, real-life Le Mans racing experience. It's a fine driving experience that lasts a good long time, especially if you want a 24-hour Le Mans drive, which is fully implemented. Le Mans boasts 70 licensed cars, including the Viper Team Oreca, Corvette Racing, and Team Cadillac, 12 real-world tracks, changing weather patterns, fully polygonal, animated pit crews, and a solid physics engine for all kinds of wipeouts. Le Mans also lost the strange Test Drive label (which was stupid to paste on the game in the first place), so it's just Le Mans, pronounced with a soft, long ~ahh~ sound, and only a trace of an ~n~ sound. Yeah, that's what I retained from my French class, sophomore year, (grade: C+, but I know all the dirty stuff, which is what's really important).   In re-creating the official courses and locales, and the right feel for this type of game, Melbourne House has gone deep into the Le Mans world. The cars are all based on GT and prototype (open and closed) models, and the style of driving is based on snaking, looping, flattish tracks that engender talent for high speeds, and carefully managed turns. Oh yeah, and patience, lots of patience. There is no car damage here, but collisions, wipeouts, and heavy-duty spinouts are common. With four camera angles (cockpit, cockpit with hood showing, behind-the-car close, and behind-the-car far), players can get several kinds of takes on the experience.   Melbourne House managed to relay a fine sense of speed with all of the cars, in addition to gaining a highly responsive set of steering controls. The cars feel good to drive, and they do as they're told. In comparison to the Dreamcast version, the PS2 version handles identically, in every aspect. You can tell how good the handling is, too, because after the seventh lap delivers an orangish hue to the vehicle meter and your traction wears down, the cars handle differently (i.e. worse). For the longer races, players can utilize the pit stops to change tires and wing position, and also to refuel, to revitalize their tires and thus the handling.   Weather also plays a big effect in the way the cars handle, and the weather system in this game is awesome. Players may start out racing laps in bright sunshine, but may only go three laps into it before the clouds break and the rain pours down. I love this aspect of the game. It may rain for five laps, three laps, or seven laps, and you never know, because every time it's different. Also, the rain comes down in different downpours, sometimes it's heavy, and the clouds darken and it literally pours down. Other times it's medium, and the rain clears up right away. The weather breaks up the relatively germane races by requiring pits stops to adjust to wet tires and creates great spin outs to boot.   The game is also by now means short. It's no 80-hour GT3, but it does deliver the ultimate 24-hour Le Mans race. Gamers can jump in for a Quick Race, or enter into Time Trials, or begin their career in Championship, from which they can enter into eight different cups (Rootie GT, Pro GT, GT Endurance, Open Prototype, Closed Prototype, Prototype Endurance, Super Endurance, and Winter Challenge), and also open up dozens of cool cars by taking first place.   For the real crazies, there is the 24 Hour Le Mans circuit, in which players can race for 24 realtime hours against 23 crazy AI drivers (this race can be set for various time settings). For those who just want a shortened version of the 24-hour madness, they can enter into the Petite Le Mans, too. Different from the Dreamcast version is the handling and AI driver skills. These two difficulty settings are linked, so players can shift higher or lower to change up the AI driver's skills, feistiness, etc. On the Dreamcast version, they were unfortunately linked, making the Hard settings very hard. Players can unlock all of the 2000 Le Mans cars (exclusive to this version) by winning both the 24-hour Le Mans and the Petite Le Mans. The AI for the most part of this race is super easy on Easy mode, relatively easy on Medium, and on hard, it's challenging, but not like trying to get the final gold cups in the Driving Tests in GT3. You just need to get a big enough head start so that when you go for a pit stop, there is a big distance between you the guy behind you. And for those who want simply can't spend 24 straight hours racing, they can change tires and wing and wing angle, refuel, and save at any time while in the pits.   Like I said before, players can get to grips with 12 real-world tracks, including the new course, the US Road Atlanta (Petit Le Mans) from the 2000 Le Mans series. The other tracks include Road Atlanta Grand Prix, Suzuka National, Suzuka Medium, Suzuka Grand Prix; Catalunya National, Catalunya Grand Prix; Bugatti; Brno; Donington National, Donington Grand Prix; and the Le Mans 24 Hours track. Road Atlanta is a nice course that adds more depth to this version, and car fans should enjoy its inclusion.   For those who love these cars (which is anyone who would buy this game), the car list includes the Audi R8, Cadillac LMP, Panoz Spyder LMP, Courage C52, Toyota GT-One, Nissan R390 GT1, GTC Competition, Panoz Esperante GTR1, Lister Storm GTL, BMW V12 LMR, Nissan R391, Riley & Scott MKIII S2, the Chrysler Viper GTS-R, and four unlockable vehicles, to boot. There are 70 licensed cars altogether, including all of the 2000 Le Mans cars.   Graphics While it's not a huge drop in graphic detail, the gamer with a talent for seeing finer details should notice several changes between the superior Dreamcast version and this slightly lesser PlayStation 2 version. First of all, we thought that most developers had figured out several ways to beat the PS2's aliasing and flickering problems down and out of sight. That doesn't seem to be the case here. The first things your eyes will pick up are flickering objects, in the replays and during the races, and aliasing problems that are large enough to complain about. On this front, I know that games on all systems have the aliasing problem to a greater or lesser extent, but many of the newer games on PS2 have practically eliminated them. Visually, the aliasing here makes thin lines, like cables and stripes on cars look jagged and ugly. It also makes fine details look cruddy and blurred. Again, these aspects don't affect the gameplay, but they hurt the eyes. Additionally, the textures in this version are worse than in the DC version, and the lighting appears more blurry and rough than in the DC version. Lastly, there appears to be some artifacts that jump out every so often, creating a dirty, sloppy feel to the graphics that were not in the DC version.   Other than those relatively hefty points, numerous visually appealing aspects in Le Mans will, on the other hand, make many gamers happy. If you can simply ignore those points (and if like the game, you should be able to), several special effects also pop out at you. When cars reach fast enough speeds, contrails stream off the wing tips of the cars, creating a beautiful scenario that car lovers will truly enjoy. It's just pretty seeing those contrails. When it rains, the once blue sky slowly clouds over and grows dark. The rain starts with little droplets and then gradually starts to pour down onto the road and on your car. Wakes of water spread out from the back tires, and flair up into the air, while droplets appear on your ~window,~ i.e. as if your TV screen was a windshield, and create splatter spots of rain that hit, and widen afterward. Also, when you're taking on the 24-hour Le Mans, it's quite a site to see the sky darken and transform into night. The sky fills in with a nice dark blue-purple color and the stars come out, creating a rosy, romantic scene.   Other graphic niceties appear in the backgrounds, if you have time to see them. The crowds are average enough, but there are little pockets of them doing different things, and the detail level of cars, objects, crowds, and other weird things will keep the curious gamer interested in them for some time. There is a Ferris Wheel in one, but just like the Dreamcast version, it appears broken -- it's never actually working, or it's off. Getting the Ferries Wheel to move shouldn't have been too hard...Other little details come in the form of skid marks on the road, grass indentations that stay that way every time you pass them again, and of course, the beautiful car models themselves are a site to see.   However, compared to GT3, these models an their textures don't really even hold a candle. Compared to GT3 nothing really does, but hey...   Sound When it comes to the way the game sounds, I have very few nice things to say at all. The music selection resembles elevator music. I can stand the milk toast jazzy song to a degree, but everything else is just lame. There is no imagination in Le Mans when it comes to music.   In the sound effects department, I would normally try to defend even the lamest of sound effects, but the engine sounds are so weak! These cars sound like radio-controlled boats or mopeds -- not like the ultimate 200-mph GT vehicles they're supposed to sound like. They just don't sound loud, powerful, or burly like they should be. These cars should be intimidating, but the sounds from these things wouldn't impress a four-year old. Another thing: while these car engines are weak sounding, the bumps, scratches, and thumps they take while hitting one another are just as wimpy. ~Plink~ ~Reccch~ ~Tttcchhh~ -- these are the sounds you'll here when cars ram and pound each other at high speeds. Gong! Yes, the backfire is cool and the screeching wheels are cool, and the crowds chime in nicely as you pass them, but they're all for naught. Much like the almost subconscious artifacting in the graphics department, there appear to be weird sound artifacting glitches here, too.   Lastly, the entire sound production is incredibly low quality. It's as if they didn't want you to turn up the sound too much because you might hear all the problems, and because the sound quality isn't very good the engine and other sounds don't crackle with the crispness that they should lap your ears with. I don't know, but the sound in this game is just plain weak. Peer may have loved the sounds in the DC version, but I just don't agree, this one needs serious help. Let's just get this out of the way right now. There is nothing out in the marketplace like Gran Turismo 3 A-spec for its sheer strength in every single department (gameplay, sounds, graphics, etc.). Le Mans 24 Hours, however, is still a good game that brings home a particular kind of racing to gamers (Le Mans cars and tracks) and while it doesn't have as many cars, or as many tracks, or the same level of graphics, it's a good, solid game. There are enough cars in here to satisfy 90% of the car addicts out there, and the driving depth is concrete with good handing, control, and decent AI. The sense of speed is solid, too, though it's not stunning.  All in all, Le Mans is a good racing game. For those of you who don't own a Dreamcast and want to race a relatively deep game with decent AI in a straightforward setup, you'll be satisfied with this.", "date": "Aug 24, 2001"}
