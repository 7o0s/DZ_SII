{"name": "Warhammer: Dark Omen", "name_review": "Warhammer: Dark Omen", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/08/14/warhammer-dark-omen", "text": "From the world of miniature wargaming comes Warhammer: Dark Omen, the second in a series and a significant improvement over the earlier Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat.  Dark Omen is a real-time strategy game set in a fantasy world, where an alliance of humans, elves and dwarves are under siege by forces of orcs and a mysterious army of Undead. The game follows the adventures of Morgan Bernhardt, the mercenary leader of the famed Grudgebringer cavalry. Through a series of engrossing cutscenes, Morgan is hired to perform a number of ever-more difficult missions that involve recovering some powerful artifacts that might help the Empire defeat the rampaging horde of Undead.  Each mission begins with a set number of forces deployed on a 3D battlefield. You can opt for the default placement or hand-place your troops before combat begins (the latter is usually preferable). Once combat begins in earnest, you control your troops with keyboard and mouse, ordering them to move, charge, use their magic items or target missile weapons at a certain foe.  Unlike most real-time strategy games, there is never any resource gathering or base building. The game's entire emphasis is on combat, and winning can only be achieved by carefully managing your troops on the battlefield, reacting to the enemy's moves and planning your own counter-attacks. Victory is most often a matter of hanging back, lulling the enemy into range of your artillery, and wiping out as many enemies as possible at a distance before closing in hand-to-hand combat.  Keeping your men alive becomes paramount during the campaign game, as units that are completely destroyed cannot be replaced between missions (though those only partially damaged can be bought back up to full strength). Often you may win a scenario only to discover that you have lost too many key units to be able to continue the game, and you will need to restart quite often. Dark Omen is not an easy game.  For the most part the missions progress in a strictly linear manner, though at several junctions you'll have an option to pick up an extra scenario, risking your expensive army for the chance to gain a little extra gold, additional allies, or magic items.  The only real problems with the game are that it does feel a little too linear at time, and the ever-increasing difficulty of the missions can lead to some frustration. Battlefield control can get a little sticky as well when you have large numbers of units, since there is no real speed control for the game, and you have to carefully manage your mage and artillery units, or they will accidentally catch allied units in their field of fire.  Apart from these minor points, Dark Omen is an altogether enjoyable and challenging game of fantasy warfare and offers an interesting twist on the real-time genre while remaining faithful to the Warhammer universe from which it springs. -- Jason Bates", "date": "Aug 14, 1998"}
