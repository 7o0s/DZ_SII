That's why we stopped by our old bud Tom Chick's house, woke him from his drunken slumber, wiped the crust out of his eyes, and asked him if he'd like to evaluate some of the PC gaming classics as compared with their contemporaries. He wittily replied, ~Uh, sure,~ and thus PC Retroview was born.    John and Jim Morris grew up playing RPGs.  Not just Dungeons & Dragons, but old-school games like Traveler and Gamma World.  Then something happened and like the rest of us, these two brothers were seduced by a terrible power that took over the fantasy role-playing industry.  Magic: the Gathering.  So when they were ready to graduate from their usual business at Stick Man Games -- porting DOS and C64 games for Japanese computers and writing shareware action games -- to make their own computer strategy game, table top collectible card games were on their minds.  They built something on a big board, complete with cards for units, equipment, and structures.  Their basic premise was cyberpunk gang warfare over a city.  They played it, they tweaked it, they balanced it.  They eventually started coding it for the Mac.  By the time they interested New World Computing in publishing it, the design was pretty much finished.  Fortunately for most of us, New World insisted on a PC version and in 1996, Chaos Overlords was born.  Turn-based strategy isn't exactly a burgeoning genre these days, so it's refreshing to rediscover sleepers like this one.  Chaos Overlords was never a tremendous success, but it certainly qualifies as a cult hit.  The Morris brothers say they get mail almost daily from people who are still playing or who've just discovered it.  New World has expressed interest in retooling the game as a downloadable version, but they haven't allocated the money necessary for such a project.  It's too bad, because Chaos Overlords will probably be hard to find.  If you can dig up a copy, you're in for a treat.  This is a design that was obviously rock solid from the start.  It has the sort of clarity you rarely find outside faithful board game ports.  The mechanics are straightforward, the numbers are all at your fingertips, and the gameplay is elegant and exciting.  It combines the best of board gaming and CCGs in a clever, but entirely derivative, cyberpunk setting.  And it even has a good AI to boot.  Your basic units are gangs, which have attributes for combat, stealth, and detection.  You can boost a gang's stats by equipping it with a weapon, armor, and a miscellaneous item.  The board is an 8x8 grid of city blocks, each with a base income value and some structures that give the block bonus effects.  For instance, office buildings provide money, hospitals heal your gangs faster, and factories sell equipment at a reduced price.    Although there are a variety of victory settings available, Chaos Overlords is basically won by using your gangs to control the most city blocks.  You can also ~chaos~ in a city block to extort money from it; if you push it too far, you'll invite a devastating police crackdown.  With rules for stealth, you can even sneak a gang into another overlord's territory and try to get the police to intervene.  But most interaction between overlords is all-out combat.  The collectible card game aspect comes from the way you hire gangs.  When the game begins, three gangs are randomly available, as if they'd been drawn them from the top of a deck.  You can hire one or dismiss one to a discard pile.  The next turn, a new gang will appear in its slot.  This gives the game a ~luck of the draw~ feel in which you have to decide whether to hold out for more powerful gangs or opt to go ahead and hire weaklings.  Fortunately, there's a great sense of balance.  You'll need to rely on a mix of cheaper gangs for specialized functions as well as powerful expensive gangs armed with high tech equipment to beat back your opponents.  Since the mechanics are laid completely bare, it might be easy to dismiss Chaos Overlords as a spreadsheet game.  Fortunately, the cyberpunk milieu really comes to life the longer you play.  Gangs are drawn with tiny but creative artwork.  You'll start to see the difference between hiring gangs from the various monastic orders and hiring the paramilitary forces who can sling the bigger guns.  There are the comparative advantages of stealth, scientific research, or generating income with gangs that are good at extortion.  And once you start researching the technology to trick your gangs out with fancy toys, it's almost like building your own units.  You get Ground Zeroes with Plasma Generators and Snipers with Rocket Launchers.  Hire a member of Pain, Inc. and give him an Inviso Cloak to sneak around and do recon in enemy territory.  Equip your Computer Hacker with Science Kits and station Bounty Hunters with Scanners around your borders to hunt down lurking enemy gangs.  And then there's the game's sense of humor.   Shotgun toting Nuns hopped up on Pain Negators.  Dominatrixes trying to root out hidden Science Teams.  Slam Dancers and Bad Artists sent on suicide missions to weaken tough enemies.  The biggest problem with Chaos Overlords is the interface.  There need to be more options to look at the map and get information.  A patch really helped by providing a new report screens and an overview of the structures in each city block.  These had been problems that very nearly ruined the game before they were fixed.  But it's still a very mouse-intensive game that requires a lot of work, partly because there are no hot keys available.  There's no way to queue up orders to move a gang across the board and since turns can take a long time, it's easy to forget what you were doing last turn.  The final stages of ~Kill 'Em All~ games, which involve full conquest of the map, are tedious in the extreme.  Because it can get overwhelming if it goes on too long, Chaos Overlords is much better suited to the other included victory options.  Unfortunately, Jim and John Morris are only dabbling part time in the game development these days.  They created the Arcomage mini-game that was included in Might & Magics VII and VIII and they've hinted that they have another project in the works, but it's still some time away.  At this point, Stick Man Games is a one hit wonder.  But if you're going to have a hit, it might as well be one that holds up as well as Chaos Overlords.  -- Tom Chick Want to share your opinions with the world?Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  orsend some mail to IGNPC about this story.  Presentation  An awful interface.
