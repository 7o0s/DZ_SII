{"name": "A Bug's Life", "name_review": "A Bug's Life", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/11/20/a-bugs-life-2", "text": "Developed by UK-based Travellers Tales, the same team responsible for the recent Psygnosis platformer Rascal, A Bug's Life centers on the exploits of an ant named Flik and his mission to defend his anthill from an army of marauding grasshoppers. Using such resources as fruit (which can be thrown) and special moves (such as the butt-smash), Flik must fight his way through 15 levels of baddies in order to send them packing.  Filled with all sorts of flora and fauna, each environment is entirely 3D and boasts a high amount of detail. In addition to the requisite plants and rocks, there are everyday garden objects to hide behind; some which can be destroyed and others that'll require some clever thinking to tackle.  Exploration elements also come into play, as Flik must seek out and enlist the aid of several other characters throughout his adventure. Rest assured that there'll also be plenty of puzzle solving gameplay thrown in for good measure.I've got to give Traveller's Tales credit for capturing the look and personality of the film, but I can't bestow an equal amount of praise on the rest of the game. Simply put, it has some serious problems, and it's not for serious players. I acknowledge that it is being marketed primarily for children, but even with that in mind it comes up lacking.The game's 3D engine is capable of producing lush environments that mimic the film's well enough, but once you actually start to move around, the action slows to a crawl. This kind of slowdown this far into the PlayStation's life span is simple inexcusable. And gameplay-wise, the game offers nothing more than any number of 16- or 8-bit action platforming titles before it did. Compounding things further, the control is awkward, and the aforementioned slowdown effects play dramatically.In the end, A Bug's Life offers nothing more than more proof that a great franchise name doesn't make for a good game. The only players I can see enjoying the game are very young children; serious gamers will be seriously ~bugged.~", "date": "Nov 20, 1998"}
